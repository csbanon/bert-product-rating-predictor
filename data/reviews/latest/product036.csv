"The ""Find"" feature is simple. All it has to do is beep the earbuds so you can find them. But that's hidden inside the Galaxy Wearable app.In order to beep your earbuds, you have to grant it access to *always on* location, storage on your device, your calendar, call logs, your contacts, the ability to make phone calls, and to send SMS messages. I also had to give it permission to INSTALL APPS on my phone, but since I couldn't find a way to take it back in settings, I assume it went to some Samsung system app somewhere, who knows where.",1,1,2020-3-7,1,1,0

"iPhone user approves these headphones and in my opinion wayyyy better than the standard AirPods . üëåüèΩ Prettier, more discrete, more comfortable less expensive, newer technology. Haven‚Äôt tried the AirPods pro but don‚Äôt want to bother with those expensive ones when there‚Äôs these. LOVE that Samsung gave Apple users more support. You‚Äôre able to change around some sound profiles and customize the headset. One of the cool features is the ambient sound which allows you to hear more of yourself and the environment around you. Very useful when you‚Äôre out and about shopping yet need to take a call or want to listen to music but still be able to hear people around you. Love this feature. You can toggle it on and off as you needI did have the older versions and can confirm that these are louder and have better call quality. Everyone can hear me clearly and perfectly during long calls. I will update this review if anything goes wrong but I don‚Äôt foresee it .",5,1,2020-2-16,1,4,0
"I'M LOVING IT!!!! NO REGRETS!!! For starters, 2 way speakers.... I'm loving it!! More ""tugs!"" You can really tell the difference. Okay, it has gotten more responsive touchwise and no delays at all. Games, music, or movies.. no problem. The magnets and hinge in the case has gotten tighter. You will now have no problem loosing your buds by falling off from the case when opened. This is not a complete review. So far I don't have anything bad to say. I haven't checked the mics, but watched a review on yt and it was crystal clear even outside. So, I will give these buds 5 stars!! I recommend!!! I'm loving it so much! It's not like ""meh"" feeling when you put them in..  it's like ""wooooah"". Another feauture they added is the volume control. Double tap the edge of the right bud and the volume turns up. Left bud, volume turns down. Make suke to go to labs settings and turn it on.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,2,0
I already had the buds and now own the buds+I've made different test with music and recording the microphone and so far they both have the same sound quality.,5,1,2020-2-20,1,2,1
Original buds were good. These are great! Much improved call quality. Music sounds better too with an additional speaker (woofer and tweeter). All day and then some battery life.,5,1,2020-2-14,1,2,0
"I have the original Samsung Buds and have 2 phones ;Samsung UI Android and Apple IOS so the new feature of multiple Bluetooth pairings is nice but clumsy.I get into that near bottom of review but this only means pairing ,you can not use these buds on 2 devices at the same time.The fit is exactly the same as the original buds and does a great job for me with passive noise reducing.ANC is earbuds is a bit overrated because your ear is exposed to sounds and there is only so much that will help.Over the ear ANC works ,I tested some buds and it barely makes a difference and could give you a headache.The overall sound is a big improvement over the original buds and the low end fits up the sound range.Not super bass but a definite improvement overall.The ambient microphone settings are a big improvement.The medium setting is more than enough to hear people talk and the high and sound labs-extra high are like hearing aids.You could hear people talk 20 feet away easily,kinda scary.The battery life is more on the 8-9 hours if you are listening to music all the time.Going down to 11 hours would probably zero out the battery and you wouldn‚Äôt want to do that.The new app (the iOS is in my pictures) for the Buds on iOS copies any Sound Lab settings you have set up on the Samsung wearable but you can‚Äôt change them just on iOS.I also noticed less difference between Dynamic,treble,bass etc on the iOS app vs. Samsung Wearable.Switching involves disconnecting from one device and connecting to the other.It is easy to disconnect on the Samsung but on the iOS you have to open Bluetooth settings.Now if you are only using one device,the buds automatically connect and disconnect so that isn‚Äôt a problem.The buds do want to connect to a Samsung device after starting,but if you are switching it is much easier than before.The touchpad tap options all work ,Spotify has to be open or with a last track playing.Just tapping Spotify didn‚Äôt wake the app for me.The Labs double tap for volume on it side works but you really have to hit the edge,too close to the middle and the other function will work (play next track)Call quality is fairly good ,if you are in a crowded place or near loud noises the person you are talking to will hear some of the sounds but not too bad.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,2,1
"Charged them up and used them all day till the evening and I gotta say I am so impressed with the battery life of these earbuds. From 9am to 6pm on a full charge using MAX Volume settings, I still had 10% left which is really good compared to all the other Bluetooth earbuds out there, the 11 hours that Samsung advertises is with the volume at 50%.  These Earbuds do not have noise cancelling but with that $150 price tag compared to all the other high $$$ earbuds that do, it‚Äôs a good trade off in price point  for the consumer that‚Äôs not looking to spend over $200 for some quality wireless earbuds.  The Ambient Sound feature is great when you need be alert of your surroundings when using both earbuds.  I‚Äôm using these with my iPhone XR and I downloaded the Galaxy earbuds plus app to customize the settings and features and sound settings within the buds pretty easily.  The Sound is great!! When I‚Äôm blasting them on full volume with the ambient sound feature turns off I don‚Äôt hear anything else around me other than what‚Äôs streaming from my phone.  I have the AirPod Pros and They sound a little better and the noise cancelling is great but is it $100 more great??? IMO no, and where I see the value of these Galaxy buds + over the AirPod Pros is definitely in that Battery life. So it really all comes down to what you value more out of daily use of your earbuds, the AirPod pros can never get me through my workday continuously without having to recharge them every 3-4 but the galaxy buds got me through 9 HOURS continuously and I still had juice left at the end of my workday which is unheard of Bluetooth headset.  If you want to maximize even more battery life, just use one earbud for 8-11 hours straight and when it runs out switch earbuds and get another 8-11 hours while the other bud is charging. To me the Battery life is a game changer and Samsung has just set the standard of what‚Äôs possible out of tiny earbud batteries. They have switched me as a daily airpod user to a galaxy bud plus supporter but Android still has a long way to go compared to iOS on the iPhone side of things.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,1,0

"My new daily drivers ahead of my Liberty Soundcore 2s. At first I was going to return these because they sound really low paired to my Galaxy S9 and they seemed not to pair to my iPhone 8. After watching Flossy‚Äôs video, I left them a bad review and then I watched Noah Herman‚Äôs video on how to pair them to my iPhone. Now I‚Äôm stoked. They work fine and sound much louder connected to that iPhone. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase and I highly recommend them. I never had the originals so I cannot compare them. I like the liberties but these are the truth. A+ AirPod killers.Update :",1,1,2020-2-16,1,8,0

"I did a lot of research before going with the Galaxy Buds +. In all honesty, I really wanted to try the new 2020 Google earbuds, but they kept stringing a release date along and I needed something better now.Keep in mind for my review: I'm not an audiophile. My $20 pair connected by a cable sound great to me. I was looking for BT earbuds with silicone pieces that seal in the ear that would work on planes and a great mic for business calls on the road. I won't have a good review of bass highs and lows or detailed sound quality.",3,1,2020-4-26,1,5,0
There is an issue with my left ear bud. Something with a mic in the left one while in ambient mode. I've tried several times to contact customer service and have been lied to about tickets being opened for my issue. Very poor customer service with different people telling very different stories. I just want to get my issue fixed so that i can clearly hear people while on the phone as that is my main method of working during the current pandemic.,1,1,2020-4-3,1,8,0
"I was so excited to get these. I thought the sound quality would be at least as good as my wife's Airpods. On first listen they were just awful. I played with the EQ, enabled Dolby Atmos on my S9 and tried every combination of tips and wings. At the optimal combination the sound was on par with the wired AKG headphones that came with my phone. I tried classical, metal, hip-hop, etc. The bass is virtually non-existent. Yes, every thing is crystal clear and articulate but with piercing high end and no bass. Some may make suggestions as to the tips, wings and EQ but what I've already tried is WAY too much work to make something you spend 150 bucks on work at a mediocre level. They say the call quality is great, I'll find out today but I didn't buy these to make phone calls. Barring a miracle, these will be going back.",1,1,2020-6-16,1,5,0
"These were ok, at first these didn‚Äôt hurt like other earbuds did for me, such as Jabra 75t, or the AirPods Pro. But after a handful of days, they started to hurt and just starting to tear up the inside my ears. It‚Äôs tough to find ones that truly fit inside your ears as there are no two ears that are alike. So I will go back to the Sony‚Äôs XM3‚Äôs as they are held in place by the actual earbud tip, as oppose to the actual plastic housing as all the other earbuds.",2,1,2020-2-24,1,7,0
"I really wanted to love these I really did but..I just don't. I'll start with the good:Battery life is absolutely amazing. They can be connected, playing music, talking on the phone, etc. for hours - and still have 70% battery.",3,1,2020-3-17,1,6,0
"The head phones so far are pretty solid. When comparing them to another blue tooth pair of headphones I have which are the Sony WH1000's the Galaxy buds aren't as great and I'm not talking about sound quality because I know the Sony headphones blow this out of the water. One of the things that I dislike about the Galaxy buds compared to Sony is how you skip or repeat songs. Having to double tap the ear bud twice can be annoying when the earbud doesn't register that you tapped twice, or when you don't double tap fast enough.The biggest problem to me though is the fact that you can't turn off the earbuds without putting them in the case. This seems like a very dumb ""feature"" in my opinion. I get that the case is relatively small in size so it isn't much of a problem to carry around but I just don't understand why there doesn't seem to be a power off option and you are forced to put your earbuds in the case every single time or else it'll just stay connected to the blue tooth until it inevitably dies. Again this may be a stupid thing for me to complain about but I've owned 3 different blue tooth head sets/ earbuds and every single one had a power off option besides this one.",4,1,2020-8-10,1,4,0

"Excellent product overall. I owned the previous generation Galaxy buds and was very happy. This generation seems to have made major improvements on some of my biggest criticisms from the last ones.1. Phone call quality significantly improved. The additional microphone dramatically helps with reducing noise on the other party's end, helping them hear me much better. Very pleased with this improvement.",4,1,2020-2-23,1,5,0
I can not fully rate these. I bought these last week and received them on Friday after waiting 4 days. When I finally get them one of the ear buds was defective and didnt work. I called samsung and was told to mail them back in. Which I did on the same Friday via UPS. Samsung received the earbuds yesterday. I called to check the status of new earbuds and was told them would possibly arrive by next Tuesday. So I have to wait a week before I get new ones. I cancelled the order to get a refund and to be told that the exchange/refund office is out of the office and my refund would take alot longer. SMH!!,1,1,2020-3-24,1,1,0
"Out of all the wireless headsets/headphones/earbuds I've ever tried, these are the best.  I have tried Anker's Soundcore, LG's, and a few off-brands, however these Samsung Galaxy Buds+ are the easiest to pair, have the best sound quality, and hands down the best battery life.When you open up the case to the earbuds, they connect right away to my phone (I believe it connects automatically to whatever your paired it with last), so I don't have to fiddle with the settings.  The connection is immediate.  I can also change the setting to hear more or less of the noise/voices in the background which is good for my line of work.  I need to be able to hear people when they call me, but I can still listen to my music.  Controls are very easy.  Tap to play music, double tap to skip forward a song, triple tap to repeat.  There is a special setting to access Bixby (or Siri, I'm sure) or you can change that to alter the ambient noise in the background.",5,1,2020-3-29,1,4,0
"I have the original Samsung Earbuds paired Samsung Galaxy S10+ 5G & Win 10 Laptop. Did not want to unpair old pair as they are 1 month old. Purchased these for home use, other pair as backup or in car. These plus buds paired easily with Windows 10. To use, go to Win 10 Sound settings and put Buds+ as device. They will work with music-videos on PC. When you close them in case, Win 10 will use PC speaker without having to change settings. Same if you use Buds first version. To install on Galaxy phone was another thing! Did not see them when opening case. Even on phone Bluetooth screen, it could not see Buds+. Tried Samsung Wearable app on phone, add device, could not see them. Restarted phone and tried again. Opened buds+ case and finally a pop-up to upgrade its software. Buds+ needs some additional plugins in order for the app to see the buds+. Once installed, it will change between original Buds & Buds+ depending on which one I want to use. Was tricky but after a few tries, they installed and both work. Was on phone with Samsung support who could not figure out what I was asking!Simple question was ""how do I install Buds+ BUT LEAVE ORIGINAL BUDS PAIRED WITH PHONE? All the time spent with them ""researching"", I figured it out. Then walked Samsung Support thru process. They should send me a check.",5,1,2020-3-1,1,1,0
These things are awesome! First time Galaxy Buds user and opted for the + model. These have great battery life on a single charge for about 11 hours and another 11 from the case...like wow that's a big upgrade from the old Galaxy Buds. Sound is crisp and not too bassy but just enough thump to make you nod to the low ends. Make sure to download the Galaxy Wearabe App to unlock its features. Pairs well with my Galaxy Note 10+. The buds themselve are shipped with about half volume making it sound low when turned up high on the phone side. I was underwhelmed until I found out the app has commands you can change like tapping volume up or down. So make sure to make the buds themselves 100% volume and it makes it a whole lot better. Ambient aware is amazingly clear because of the additional mic making it 3 instead of 2 from last buds. Thus making calls is a breeze from the other party hearing your voice more clearly. Samsung really stepped up their Galaxy Buds lineup.,5,1,2020-2-22,1,1,1
"I bought these as I saw reviews online saying how great they were. That the second driver they come with helped improve the bass which the original buds were missing. Also the call quality is supposed to be a lot better. I don't really use my buds for that but I though if the sound is that much better and the call quality was improved than the latter was a bonus. However the sound was not better. In fact I couldn't tell the difference between the plus and the original buds. After listening to multiple tracks they pretty much sounded the same. That was very disappointing. As for the ambient noise improvements I couldn't tell the difference either. The four modes they added (one is hidden behind developer settings) didn't seem to be any better than the old ones. If you are playing your music loud on either buds you won't be able to hear the ambient noise. It's really meant for when you have music or video at lower volume. It works really well with podcast or shows without a lot of action (explosions). However if you are jamming at the gym even the highest setting won't make a difference. I do like the look of them. The touch pad is shinier than the original ones and just gives it a cool look. I wasn't a fan of the case which is no longer matte black, but shinny black. It makes it a finger print magnet. As for the call quality I never got around to testing it because I was disappointed in the sound quality difference that keeping the buds and spending this much wasn't worth it to me for enhanced call quality. Again that is due to me not using any buds or earphones for talking on the phone. I do have to say if you don't own any buds and need some these are great buds. However if you own the original ones pass on the upgrade. Also for iphone users these now have an app on the iphone so they are a great alternative to the airbuds. They don't have NC like the airbuds pro but they are a lot cheaper. If you are a bass head I'd say skip them. They don't have a tone of bass. But other genre of music sounds great on them. I do wish for none Samsung phones they would support a codec above AAC.",4,1,2020-2-19,1,8,0
"I love Apple products and their whole interwoven environment.  I bought the AirPods plus and thought they were great; still do.  However, I kept reading these Galaxy plus buds were superior.  So, I bought them.  Guess what?  They are super - WOW! The sound quality and battery life make these the winner in a contest.  They pair easily with my iPads and iPhone X.  They even look better in your ears.  You can immediately see and hear the difference.I like Jazz and African music and they pick up sound ranges you don‚Äôt get on the AP plus.  Also, I like using them for Audible books.  I can hear the voices nice and clear, especially higher ranges.  Forget the AP+ and save $100, which perform at 80% of Galaxy+.

"It took one over a month to receive the eqrbuds and I was very excited to open them. Once opened my Galaxy S20+ automatically downloaded the software for the ear buds+ as well as the Samsung Wearables app. Sounds great right? Thats where the fun began. After charging them overnight I opened the earbud case and they automatically paired, but when the wearable app opened it showed the left earbud and case connected but did not show anything for the right earbud. I did troubleshooting through Samsung website as well as Samsung pro tech over the phone and they were considered to be defective so I need replacements. I have just did an item return and replacement on Amazon and now I have to ship everything back and the arrival date on the new pair is set for June 10th.

Bought these for the ambient noise. I've only ever used one ear bud. Thought these would be a great way to enjoy using both.However that feature is only available when using a app that requires access to everything on your phone. This is unacceptable. It should be available stand alone. A simple pattern a pushes wouldn't have been hard to add. Guess the opportunity to make more profit was to hard for them to pass up.,1,1,2020-4-24,1,3,0
"Initially got them and threw them right in. The sound quality was fine, but they did wiggle a bit. I switched out to a bigger size ear ring, and they fit perfectly.  I went for a five mile run out of the box, and they never once moved or came out. I will say that ambient noise is a bit harsh and unusable for running, if the wind hits the right way it is unbearable.The case feels solid and weighted, feels expensive. The ear buds dont fall out due to magnets in the case. Setup is not super easy. You pull the case out of the box, open it, and you are prompted to connect. You press yes, followed by agree or disagree to share info and your set up. I had a small gear update, but didnt take over 2 minutes.",5,1,2020-3-5,1,9,1
"If you're looking for all day usage, great call quality and overall good connection reliability, this should be at the top of your list. If you are critical and want your music to be as transparent, clear and immersive, bluetooth will not take you there. You need a good DAC and a decent pair of iem's for that. Having owned the original and now the plus, it is a good enough upgrade to justify the price. I will not go into the features but it is implemented properly and Samsung seems to have worked out all the glitches.Bluetooth has it limitations and while it has been getting progressively better, it could never replace a good pair of headphones. This technology is a couple years old and I think it's about time some engineers come up with something else that would enable us the bandwidth to stream without degradation/ compression. You can enable Dolby Atmos, change EQ settings, apply effects and all the bells and whistles that come with the application, it will never bring out what is already lost.

Touchpad is hypersensitive so every time you touch them t your iphone goes to mute -- well, I assume it's mute because it doesn't actually say mute (documentation actually admits that!) and there's no way to unmute it without disconnecting the call and re-dialing. I can't tell you how many times I've had to do that, with 30+ people on a conference call. In theory you can reprogram the options for the touchpad, but  if you don't have the right iphone you can't because the Galaxy Buds+ app isn't compatible with your phone. (Of course, you don't know this until you buy it and download the app, which says, ""Not compatible with your device"" when you try to boot it up.

"I go back and forth from iOS to Android often. I had the first set of AirPods and they just never fit correctly.

"I was skeptical at first because I have small ears and nothing seems to fit me right. I was afraid they'd either fall out or hurt my ears. It took me a few days to get used to them but I car wear them all day at work without making my ears sore. I've not had them fall out once since I figured out which wingtip to use. That's impressive for me, I've not had an earbud that felt like it fit me right since the older flat style. Battery life is impressive, I wear the right one for my whole 8 hour shift every day and it still has life left at the end of the day. As far as sound quality goes I'm probably not the pickiest person out there, but I think they sound great. I've only been on a call a few times with them but didn't have any problems. I use a Galaxy S10e phone and connection is instant as soon as you open the case. No disconnect problems at all so far.This is coming from someone who until a few weeks ago didn't wear earbuds and didn't like things in their ear - I love them.

"Update #2: I called Samsung support and I told them that I'd tried letting them charge, uninstalling the software and forgetting the device in my phone's bluetooth settings, and then re-adding them but nothing worked. Samsung support said that the only thing left to do was to send them in for a warranty return. I was thinking about requesting replacement but did some further reading and decided not to. Apple and Samsung use two different bluetooth codecs. Apple used AAC and Samsung's codex is similar to atpx. While Samsung says that they will work with iPhones, they don't really always play nicely with each other. In other words I could get a new set and run in to the same problem again. I decided to go with sending them in for a refund and doing more research before buying another paid.Update: 5 stars to 1. The earbuds worked great for about a week and now the right bud won't connect. I've read all the posts about fixing the problem from letting the buds sit and charge and resetting. Nothing is working. Very disappointed.",1,1,2020-5-12,1,6,0
"The right earbud volume suddenly got really low and I am unable to fix it. They sound great and work great other than that. I have had many other true wireless buds where the volume gets low after using for some time.Edit: Tried to submit a warranty claim to Samsung, but they won't accept my Amazon invoice as a valid proof of purchase!",1,1,2020-5-25,1,9,0
"I used these ear buds with a galaxy Note9...not only were they NOT comfortable even after I changed the rubber pcs, but the sound quality was terrible. How could this be true if the amazon reviews are high?... they're not worth $100 either....the reviews proved to be fake and I returned this product immediately. The ear bud application comes with a built sound equalizer but even after all the testing in different modes, the sound quality wasn't any better. The connectivity wasn't great either, I used these while exercising as my 1st test = ""F"" , its amazing they were NOT even close to be as good as the reviews I read BEFORE I purchased these originally. The ear buds disconnected several times even after I tried them at home where cell and bluetooth coverage is usually great, I tried them also while on a call...and that was also poor. The listeners heard EVERY background noise and I heard echoes from time to time which was also annoying. I returned these immediately, maybe in the next 2yrs Samsung will create buds that work with ALL of their phones and not just some of thier phones - back to the drawing board Samsung. ***Buyers be aware, just because a product is expensive doesn't make it great, and the 5 star reviews are not reliable or honest. Try the cheaper ear buds first, you'll be amazed at the sound quality, and comfortable fit*** I'm going back to my $20 pair, they sound better and have more comfortable fit.",1,1,2020-7-27,1,5,0

"I spent the day today comparing the Pixel Buds 2 with the Galaxy Buds, the Buds+, the Jabra Elite 65t and the Jabra Elite 65e.As for sound quality...I was shocked to find that the original Galaxy Buds (with last week's update) have the most balanced, smoothest and most listenable sound of the three standard ""buds"".  The EQ baked into the Buds app makes a HUGE difference in sound and makes them sound ""alive"".  The Elite 65t have a good, well-balanced sound that can be adjusted to your liking so I'd rank them second in sound quality.  Next, the Pixel Buds are good but they don't shine in any one area.  There well balanced but just, okay.  I was hoping for better.  The biggest disappointment to my ears were the Buds+.  Even with the EQ in the app, they're shrill and unlistenable for long periods of time.  Really bad.  And finally, the Elite 65e (while in a different category) have the best ""musical"" sound of the bunch.  Great balance overall.",3,1,2020-5-1,1,4,0
"I do not know if I received a bad pair, or these headphones are just not what I thought. I've been looking for a headset that has both music with Great sound and have a clear excellent call quality. EMPHASIS on the CALL QUALITY. I really wanted to be able to talk to someone without holding my phone and not have to repeat myself several times or ask the caller to repeat themselves. Being quarantined makes it worse because most of the time I'm in the house. So if you can't hear me in the house it's worse when I'm food shopping outside. Now I have to hold my phone and I want to touch almost nothing while out and about especially these days with the covidüò´. I'm super sad to have paid this amount of money and still not get what I was looking for.I even gave these headphones some time. (7 weeks) See if I had to adjust to them. I upgraded to a new galaxy phone (S20 5G) I played with the settings in the galaxy wearable app. Changed the ear buds and wings. Nothing worked. My mom says I sound like I'm under water. My friend says I sound low. My man keeps asking me to repeat myself. Eventually I just disconnect them all together. For $150 I should not be struggling so much. I'm just incredibly sad and disappointed...",1,1,2020-6-15,1,4,0
"I still own a pair of pixel buds (the older ones) which I still love however I wanted to try true wireless and lemme just say I love it. Please note that I have an Android phone so I can't attest for iPhone user reviews but for Android phone users it's the best ones I've gotten.I love the ambient sound feature since I do want to be aware of my surroundings and it's easily controlled through the app. You can even turn it off if you don't like it. The noise cancellation is also pretty good, ofc if you're looking for Bose noise cancellation that's not going to happen but it's pretty close! What I love is the battery life and how they don't hurt my ears, it's great b/c as a uni student I study for very long hours.

Dont believe YouTube videos about touchpad volume helps this it dont. Also if ear wax gets behind silver gill speaker sound like it's not even on only way to fix this is basically destroying the buds by taking the grill of (which u cant put back on) and cleaning black fiber thing behind the grill...dont waste ur money u been WARNED!!!!,1,1,2020-4-5,1,7,0
"I've tried many true wireless headphones. Compared to the said to be king of Sony xm whatever the effs, they're better for a couple reasons. The Sonys sound better but they over compress the sound which I don't like. If you don't know what that means basically as the volume gets louder they can press it more so the clarity stays the same. On the other hand the Galaxy buds don't have the sound quality as far as range as a Sony but you don't lose quality as the volume goes up and it definitely gets louder on the Galaxy buds then on Sony. Also the Ambient sound is way better on the Galaxy buds which is why I bought them along with the fact that they are more Contour to your ear and I bought them mostly to ride my dirt bike long distances with music and also being able to hear my bike. And the Galaxy buds will last longer on those long bike rides. The case quality on both seems about the same but the Sony case is so big it would be hard to travel with in your pocket whereas the Galaxy buds is much easier to conceal. Overall I'm much happier with these than the Sony. On multiple levels. Honestly who needs adaptive sound when I set my headphones a way I want I like them to stay there.After 2 months: The galaxy buds are really everything I could every ask for so far. The battery life is incredible, and the touch controls work great and have many functions. I like that I can take one out and the remaining bud switches to mono immediately, I can also wear them all day with no discomfort which is a first. And I noticed today when I switch to tablet from my phone they maintain your app settings and switch over flawlessly. I also just dropped one in the gravel and it didn't scratch. From my research and experience these are the best on the market, hands down.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,3,0
I am sending these back. The bass was horrible and so was the volume. My four year old Jaybird X2's sound 100 times better. Maybe I got a defective pair since mostly all other reviews say the sound is great.,1,1,2020-2-18,1,2,0
"I've been skeptical about true wireless earbuds for a long time now. They are so wildly expensive for something that only works for 4-6 hours average. The sound quality is mediocre on most brands due to the wireless and I totally understand that you are giving up certain things for the true wireless capability. Then in steps the Buds Plus. These little ear pieces are amazing. 11 hours of battery life without a charge and, let's face it, if they're not in your ear, they're charging in the case. So that keeps them going strong all day. The sound quality is pretty great compared to other brands I've tested, especially when you use the Equalizer on the Samsung Wearables app. The ambient noise feature is great for when there are people around and you don't want to take the earpiece out. Just simply pause your music and its basically like nothings there. People have even commented on how well they can hear me during a phone call which makes these perfect for work. All around, I can't say they're perfect. But dang do these come pretty close.",4,1,2020-3-1,1,1,0

I had lost the right bud of my previous generation Galaxy Buds and knew I had to get the next one that came out. Had these since launch day and couldn't be more happy about owning them. I use these on a day to day basis and the battery life is incredibly mind blowing. I practically wear them with no problem. My most favorite feature about these are the ambient noise because I'm pretty sure I've already damage my ear drums. So these are able to enhance my hearing and makes me realize I love these.

"I absolutely love these ear buds!!! They are fantastic.  If you read a review from anyone saying they suck,  I humbly submit they are incapable of reading directions and setting the buds up correctly. You need a seal on the ear by using the correct wing fin piece or no fin at all (like my ears required) and the correct ear piece. I cannot get over the ear candy I am enjoying.  The bass is solid, and the battery life is impressive.  Definitely better than the previous buds. I highly recommend them.

"When fitting properly these have great sound, rich bass, nice mid and treble. Samsung provides 3 different ear rings and 3 different tips to help you attain the proper fit. Proper fit means these buds fit your ear canal snuggly, and stay snug. My issue with them is that after trying all the various combinations of ear ring and tip sizes I was never able to get a snug fit that stayed snug. The rich sound would, over 20 minutes or so, start to sound ""tinny"". I would then push and twist them back in, and they would sound good again for a short while, till they slipped a bit. By a bit I am talking about a fraction of a millimeter, even that little makes a difference. Forget about exercising or running, that creates too much motion for them to stay properly fitted. I don't have this problem at all with Apple earpod pros. As an Android guy this saddens me, I hate paying premium for Apple products.",3,1,2020-2-22,1,1,0

Samsung forums are covered w/ this issue and Samsung support was worthless on this.  I have an android Pixel phone w/ all the latest updates, samsung apps to support the buds, updated buds + firmware, etc. and the silly things gave horrible sound.  I did experience SOME bad audio stationary and working on my macbook pro, but it was unbearable outside jogging w/ my phone at my waist.  It did improve, but wasn't all the way solved when holding my phone up above my chest, so seems these buds have a problematic connection...they must be close AND there must not be any external noise.

"The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ are well-priced and long-lasting wireless earbuds that may make you reconsider the need for active noise cancellation. After changing the silicone tips to ensure a fit for my ear with the included different sizes, the buds do a great job passively reducing noise by just blocking out sound, muting high pitched sounds and voices nearly as good (~80% airpods pro, ~30% Bose quietcomfort) as ANC products, though it doesn't block out lower frequencies well. The buds are comfortable and last for the whole day, and the ambient mode allows sound in with a touch of the buds so you can listen to your environment without taking the buds/music out.*Pros*",5,1,2020-3-1,1,6,0

I have only had them for one day, so I may need to adjust this review later, but I have tried them in several ways and tried most of the options.They are comfortable and come with three sets of tips and wings.  The wings help to keep the buds in your ear by hooking to the inner fold in your ear once twisted into place -- you can't feel them, but if you try to take out the earbuds, they have to be twisted to come out -- thus they feel secure in your ear.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,6,0
"I must be the most unlucky person with these. I've payed for 4 pairs, only 2 have arrived.

I had to call in to get my refund, 9 days later, even though they showed the record of undeliverable. Ridiculous.Shipping isn't the fault of the manufacturer, but quality is. I've had a black pair (bought retail at best buy, because amazon couldn't get me a pair, even when I paid) had terrible feedback and interference issues. Randomly during jogging, it would get garbled and have extremely poor distortion that was physically painful. So I returned those to Best Buy. Then the red version became available on amazon.

"I received these earbuds today. To set them up you need to install Samsung's ""Galaxy Wearable"" app. My phone is a Google Pixel 3 (Android) and I installed the app from the Google Play Store. But the app refuses to get past the initial start screen unless you give it permission to access all your contacts, storage and location (see the screenshot). I tried granting it permission to everything except contacts but it just quits and when I start it again it asks for that permission again. Samsung's explanation for the ""Contacts"" permission is this cryptic nonsense:  ""Used to provide services that need to be linked with accounts using registered Samsung account information""So it basically comes down to this: you either hand over your all contacts to Samsung or you won't be able to use the earbuds you purchased. This looks like a serious disregard for customers' privacy and is extremely user-hostile.",1,1,2020-6-23,1,5,1
"These fit better (meaning they are way more comfortable, and they will not slip out like my airpod pros do). The music, podcasts and YouTube videos all sound rich and brilliant (use the Dynamic setting in the app).

"Having owned a pair of AirPods Pro for an iPhone they worked fine but I didn‚Äôt like the fitment they felt when putting them in my ear and would slide out a bit to be a bothersome especially when working out and having to stop every time to adjust them. These Galaxy Buds+ are in my regards way better than the Pros and actually fit in my ear making a snug seal. The Genie Red Color looks so premium and is an overall great pair of buds to admire. I am using an iPhone with these Buds and Samsung actually made an App specifically designed for the Buds+ In the App Store with the UI being similar to what you‚Äôd find on the Android PlayStore In doing so you‚Äôd be getting the same great features with no compromise of losing out on the Ambient sound. My only niche that I have with these Buds is that the Pros coexist with Siri so you‚Äôd be able to say ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù without taking your phone out of your pocket but the same can be achieved on these Buds you just have to hold manually on the touch pad to initiate Siri to start listening, but can‚Äôt blame Samsung for that since that would have to come from Apple. Apart from that I don‚Äôt miss my AirPods Pro one bit and I enjoy using these whenever I‚Äôm at work, or driving on long trips being able to make calls is great.",5,1,2020-3-21,1,3,1
"UPDATE:  So, I'm actually changing my star rating from 2 to 4.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S10+ phone and I was able to dial in a decent sound on these after finding a hidden setting called Adapt Sound (had to search for it in settings).  By telling my phone that I am over 60 years old in the accessibility settings it finally bumped the volume to a useable level.  To share the settings I found livable...  Dolby Atmos OFF, Adapt Sound ""Over 60 years old"" with Sound Preference ""Soft"" (this cuts the boomyness out of the bass and raises the volume significantly)...  in the Wear app, Ambient sound on Low... Equalizer set to Clear.  I found the clear equalizer to be the best once the volume was higher.  With these settings, these headphones are totally acceptable.  It is odd to me that the originally Galaxy buds seemed to fair better right out of the box but I'm pretty happy with these now.My original 2-star review:",4,1,2020-4-14,1,2,0
"1st Red Flag: Original Samsung seal is not on the box at all... Has regular tape as a seal.  -___-2nd: I have a GalaxyNote9: These buds have a very unstable connection.

"HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I got these buds the 18th and have used them at the gym for 2 days and right out for the box they fit perfectly, no pain in my ears from them. The ambient sound works really well no as if not having them in your eat at all. the Lab part on the app is nice, double-tap the side to go volume up on the right and down on the left bud. Had no time delay between video and audio. they have decent bass, and I love bass. compared to the last-gen they are a lot better and worth an upgrade. I highly recommend these to anyone who is active and likes to listen to music on the go. (side note I am using a Galaxy 10 +).

"Best-in-class battery life, good physical design, lots of neat functionality with the Samsung Wearables app. Compared the sound quality to my $120 Bose Soundsport (they are connected with a wire though, haven't tried the pure wireless Soundsport Free) and the Galaxy Buds+ were markedly worse. I'm not an audiophile, but it was night and day difference. I'm going to stick to my Bose for listening to music at the gym and use the Galaxy Buds+ for more out and about music/calls. If the primary purpose is listening to music, would stick to wired headphones from a brand that focuses on audio. If your use case is more versatile and you want to use this for equal parts music and taking calls, these are very convenient and provide an ok audio experience.",4,1,2020-7-3,1,5,0
Bought these to workout in. I don't use the ambient noise feature outside running due to the fact it causes too much wind noise. Turning this feature off and you won't hear wind noise. I think the sound quality is pretty good. Could use more bass in my opinion. The earbuds charge quickly and the battery life is long. I love the styling and the fit of the ear buds out of the case fit really snug. There are several rubber adapter buds to find one that fits your ear best. Connects to the phone very easily. Cool animation on your phone when you open the ear bud case showing you battery life of the case and each ear bud. Tap the left ear bud edge to decrease volume and right buf to increase volume. You can pause by tapping and change tracks. Many more features. My wife wants a pair now. Only downfall is that the case is small and I am afraid I will lose them at some point. There is a find my ear buds feature on my phone though. :),5,1,2020-4-14,1,3,0
"I bought Jabra 75T and Galaxy bud+ to compare as the Apple Air Pods I tried kept breaking up on a Samsung Galaxy S8 while listening to music. Yes the Jabras seem to have a slightly better overall sound until I found 'Settings/Sounds/Advanced/Adapt Sound' on the S8 - it increases the sound quality dramatically on the Buds+.So I tried both the Jabras and buds+ by walking around my large backyard using 4G LTE on the phone . After walking about 60 feet , the Jabras started breaking up just like the Air Pods.( poor Bluetooth connection) This only happens when I have my phone in my shorts side pocket, the Galaxy buds still work perfectly. The only way to keep the Air pods and Jabras working perfectly is to have my phone in my T-shirt breast pocket . Not ideal when I'm working out there.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,3,0
"So I've had these a while and I like to post reviews a while after I have a product to give my opinion on it. I love these earbuds. I couldn't be happier. I use them all the time and only have to charge the case about once a week. I use these for watching YouTube, iheart radio and other sound apps. But the biggest perk I think I like most about these is the instant noise canceling it has for the ambient sound. I use these for hearing protection. I wore these today while shooting a .45 acp 1911... barely heard the shot. It was awesome. I use it at work for hearing protection too and even in loud environments I can still hear music and other sounds from it. Now the part I don't like so much is that you can't talk on the phone good in a loud environment but I don't do that often so it doesn't concern me so much but calls with it in normal conditions is great. I'm giving this all 5 stars because they're perfect for me. Not entirely sure they're worth the amount I paid for them but easily worth atleast $100. For earbuds capable of doing all this its worth it. I don't really have complaints about this at all. Like I said I love these and probably would buy again if needed but they work great so I don't see that happening very soon. I say buy them and see for yourself. They're pretty amazing. The AKG sound is awesome to have with it. Samsung did a great job with this. Update: I'm uploading a video that IS edited to best match how much noise gets blocked with medium ambient sound on. This is my opinion and this is why I use them at work.",5,1,2020-8-2,1,3,1
I've owned a few Bluetooth headphones over the years but they had always been cheap set ups. I didn't hate them and they ultimately did what I wanted them to. My last set finally stopped charging and I decided to try these as a step up.They're great. I like that I can lift in them and still hear a little of the ambient sound around me.

They're so light you can barely tell they're in your ears and I've been wearing them for 4 hours straight as of writing this and they aren't uncomfortable even a little.No-brainer for $150.

"I'd been wanting to get true wireless earbuds for a while. I stayed away from Apple's AirPods because the shape for whatever reason will not stay in my ear (and their AirPod Pros were more than I was willing to pay). After reading up on the reviews of a few different wireless earbud brands, I was between these and the Jabra Elite Active 65t. For me, I was looking for earbuds that fit comfortably and securely, even through physical activity like running. I cared less about sound quality and call quality (as long as it was decent). I liked that the Jabra buds were intended for exercise, but in the end I went with the Samsung earbuds as I liked them a little better aesthetically, and the reviews said they were fine while wearing them on runs.I've had them for almost a month now, and they've been great! I've gone on a couple runs with them, as well as wearing them for other workouts. It took my ears a couple days to get used to them, but now they fit very comfortably. The wing tips ensure they're super secure in my ears, and I never feel like they're going to fall out. The sound quality and call quality are both fine as well, and no complaints about the battery life.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,4,0

"Love love love! These are so great. They stay in and the sound is clear as a bell. There is an ""Ambient Sound"" setting on the app which makes it easy to hear what's going on around you in addition to what you're listening to. The buttons on the pods are super sensitive, which took a bit of practice to get used to. It's hard to adjust them in your ears without hitting the touch pad, but I'll get used to it. Love the charging case. At work I can keep one in my ear and keep the other one charging, which means both of them will charge. Worth the money and I got them in red so they kind of look like jewelry!",5,1,2020-5-6,1,3,0
"I bought these to replace a set of Motorola S305 (10+ years and still working!).  I am disappointed of these.  Some of the let downs are probably me not liking this form factor, but others are inexcusable.Sound quality: horribly tinny (as in the metal).  Very pitchy metallic sound.  Also, I was not able to figure out why volume was adequate for music, but unusable (low) for calls.  Moved every setting and equalizer slider to no avail.",3,1,2020-9-1,1,1,0
"Ok this is an upgrade for me from the SM-r170. This is superior in the one place I wanted the most, that is the battery life! I started at 6am and didn't take them out at all except a half hour break till 4:15pm. The right earbud still had 29% and the left had more. All other features seem pretty much the same. The Wearable app does now show the cases battery level as well which is a great improvement. The case feels and looks sturdier and more attractive with a heavier shinier appearance and better left right indicator inside. The ambient sound function is noticeably improved! I was able to leave them in during an entire conversation with my boss today no problems at all hearing him. As a matter of fact unlike the older model I couldn't even tell I was hearing the sound being converted to digital and back to my ear again other than a mild background hiss, but that was expected considering heavy equipment was running around us. This is absolutely the best ever earbuds! The wings on the shape are superb allowing me to twist them in behind a fold in my ear which allows them to lock in place. They never fall out!",5,1,2020-3-16,1,2,0
"I was so excited to receive these. It is very hard to find excellent earbuds, especially from Samsung. I just received these yesterday and without going into a lot of detail, these really let me down. They are confusing, uncomfortable, and very expensive. In the first hour of using them, all my calls dropped. I did do the update which seemed to help, but I am not taking any chances. I feel like these buds are strictly for music, NOT phone conversations.I was also not happy with the ambient noise feature and tapping on the buds to skip song selections. It was very annoying. A light press would not work; I had to hard press to skip or pause a song, which only drives the earbud deeper into my ear canal (not comfortable at all).",2,1,2020-3-21,1,2,0
"The Buds+ are undeniably the best mid-range earphones currently out there.Even against premium models such as the Sony1000xm3 and Sennheiser Momentum2, the Samsung Galaxy Bids+ remains a serious contender.",4,1,2020-9-6,1,2,0
"I tried Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 and Aukey EP-N5. ALL I can say Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Plus is the best. It has truly 11 hours battery life, fit perfectly in my ear and won't drop out easy. Especially, it has clear call in noise environment like factory or restaurant. It is also good soundproof,  I am not even use Ambient sound figure.Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 has cristal sound, I love it a lot. But the microphone is worse in noise environments. Your friend can't here you on other side easy.",5,1,2020-8-5,1,3,0
"These buds are great. I've always been one to shrug off wireless earbuds, and thought that airpods were just hype. But after buying these, I get it. If all other wireless buds are like the beats+, then they're well worth the money.These shipped to me a day earlier than estimated, and were ready to go out of the box. The battery life on them is awesome, I've been wearing them all day every day (it's quarantine baby) and they haven't died on me once. They also come with a charging case so that you can charge them back up at home or on the go.",5,1,2020-5-5,1,3,0
"Brief summary:The Galaxy Buds+ are a very decent set of truly wireless earbuds, and great successor to the original Galaxy Buds. They are lightweight, comfortable, have a long battery life, and the sound quality is more than sufficient enough for enjoying music on the go. They also cancel out a decent amount of noise despite the fact that there is no Active Noise Cancellation. There is also great synergy between devices, especially Samsung devices, if you own them. Whether you're on iOS or Android, these are a better choice compared to the other offers in this price point, and even beyond. (Yes, even AirPods).",4,1,2020-2-17,1,3,1
"I had these buds for a week before trouble arose.  Last night, I left them to charge overnight on my Samsung brand USB charger and this morning I woke to the distinct scent of burning electronics.  I found the culprit to be these galaxy buds.  The lithium battery had expanded and melted my charger and ruined the galaxy buds.  The charger had gotten so hot that the insulation surround the cable melted and fused the charger and buds case together, ruining both, all this happening while my family was sleeping a few feet away.  This is a fire hazard and very well could have damaged more than just the charger and buds.The troubles with this product don't stop there.  The quality is sub par, especially for the exorbitant price tag.  The sound quality is poor with too much highs, weak mids and a sorry bass, in fact the previous model of galaxy buds boasted better sound quality.  These buds also suffer from many of the issues present in the first model, which I also own such as battery discharging unequally between buds and poor Bluetooth connection range.  The one benefit I saw in these over the previous model was a longer battery life, funny because now the battery is swelling and smoking on my front patio as I type this.",2,1,2020-5-28,1,2,1
"CONS: it‚Äôs mainly for Apple iPhones, it doesn‚Äôt switch sometimes when a call comes in. You just change it yourself on the call interface. Minor inconvenience when it happens but it‚Äôs very live-able. But I will say if you have them connected and make a call you won‚Äôt have that issue. Nothing gets 5 stars for noise cancellation, but passive is Isolation is up to the user getting it to fit.This is the all around golden standard.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,2,0
"These headphones are decently comfy (my ears still get ""tired"" from them and ache a bit after long wear, but they're not the worst I've had), and do a really good job of staying in my ears. However, I bought them for work and find it annoying that they can't dual-connect to my laptop and phone the way literally every pair of bluetooth headphones I've had in the last several years can. This means if I want to take a call on my phone, I have to first disconnect from my laptop then switch over to my phone.Seems like a really silly limitation in 2020.",4,1,2020-7-24,1,1,0
"This is a comparison of my wife‚Äôs & i‚Äôs: Powerbeats 2, taotronics 72 something‚Äôs, echo buds, & Soundcore liberty pros. Galaxy buds overall pretty good. Little overpriced I feel. Not very loud, but what volume there is, seems pretty good. No prob connecting to galaxy s7, windows 10 pc, iPads ect. Can‚Äôt use Alexa app on phone so that‚Äôs a bummer. Would of liked to be able to hands free, say call wife. But have to open Alexa app, & even then didn‚Äôt really understand what I was wanting. Lots of wind noise when anc is on. I typically don‚Äôt use so no biggie. Great fit &finish. Distance is trypical crappy Bluetooth, about 25ft. Initially bought the libertys cuz of rave reviews of volume. Wanted to like them but found them to be high volume/low quality. As well as being huge. These fit similarly to wife‚Äôs echo buds. But Sound better. Bout the same crappy volume. The cheapy taotroncs are as loud or louder. I guess that‚Äôs the trade off for earbuds: high volume=larger driver=heavier. Would of bought the echo buds if they were $50 cheaper. 130$ for them is just too much. The touch controls are finicky, seems hard to double tap to skip track. Would of rather spent less on a physical button, but we live in an age of sissies who have overly sensitive fingers, & wants everything with the least amount of physical activity as possible. Bike rides/walking pretty comfortable. Like I said tho with anc activated wind noise is an issue. Wish the bud tips went further into ear. Tho I know a lot of ppl don‚Äôt like that. In all, Don‚Äôt regret purchase, but a little pricey for what they offer.",4,1,2020-3-31,1,1,0
I was very excited to get these at first. I had a cheaper pair of Soundpeats that I loved. I was going to upgrade because I thought maybe I was missing out on something with all the good reviews these had. These ear buds get very loud. No complaints there. But they are just not that bass heavy at all. I don't listen to alot of hip hop or anything but I like a good low sound. They fit very well. There would be no chance of them falling out. I was very pleased with that.There are a lot of good things to day about them. This is the 3rd pair of true wireless ear buds I've had. The wireless charging is nice but not a must for me. I'm also not a fan of the touch pad on the side. I prefer a physical button to push. Just my preference not a downfall at all. The touch pad works great and very responsive.,3,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
"The first set was defective--the right bud was just dead and would not work at all.  The amazing thing was Amazon customer service.  I returned the defective pair to my local UPS store in the morning,  and to my great surprise,  when I arrived home after work,  the replacement was already on my porch.  Amazon should be renamed ""Amazing.""  Seriously!  And, these buds are amazing too.  The app is simple to use and very versatile.  I want good ambient sound for safety reasons,  so being able to just dial in the level is super.  The sound quality is great too--better bass than I expected.  I highly recommend these.  Right out of the box, they fit like they were made for me, but they include multiple sizes of silicone parts to accommodate various ears.  I am so amazed by both Amazon amazing service and Samsung engineering.  Buy them.I've been using them for a few days now, and their value increases with every day.  I used them with Google maps navigation and while playing music,  when a turn comes, the music mutes and the voice is incredibly clear (much, much, better than my great Plantronics earpiece) then the music resumes on cue.  Just a fantastic way to drive.  Talking on the phone is much better than with a one-ear unit, too.  I could not be more pleased.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,1,0
"AKG continues to deliver for me.  (They are the ones who make these buds with Samsung's brand name on top).  Shockingly good bass considering the size.  Very nice sound isolation.  The ambient noise is a little weird to get used to but I can definitely see me using it while in the office (once COVID goes away) and when out listening to music.  The mic on here is pretty passable.  I was concerned for a bit when people started complaining about being able to understand me, but then realized I was using the wrong size ear inserts for my ears.  Once I swapped over to their large inserts the problems went away.  These definitely require a tight fit in your ear to get the best quality (both sound and mic).Only complaint I have is that from time to time the ear buds get just a little bit out of sync when using them.  It is usable in that state... but gives an odd voice doubling effect.  Not sure if this is something other buds have issues with.  That said, it happens infrequently enough, and otherwise these are amazing headphones!!",4,1,2020-10-4,1,1,0
"Loving these earbuds! They are lightweight and with the different size tips and wings, it's easy to get them to fit just perfect. I've put them through a number of workouts (lifting, running, etc) and they have never fallen out or even felt like it was a possibility.The bluetooth connection is quick and pretty strong. Only issue I've had thus far is you have your phone sitting across the room and you turn so you are sideways to your phone (you could draw a straight line between left earbud, right earbud and phone) an occasional audio dropout. Otherwise I have no problems with leaving my phone in the living room and traveling all over the house, or even outside.",4,1,2020-6-23,1,1,1
Had the original Galaxy Buds and the Icon X (neither were very good IMO) prior to that so was hoping for improved sound and better comfort but not there for me unfortunately. Everyone is different and have different requirements but I find these really uncomfortable to wear for longer than 20 mins and the sound is not great. I've tried all included tips and wings but not any better. I'm a big guy with a large head and ears so need the largest tips. I don't feel that they sit far enough into my ear canal and as a result the sound is quite tinny with no bass. I keep moving them around and pushing them further into my ear. When I do that I can hear more bass and better sound but it proves that the fit isn't right for me. The battery life is much improved and connectivity is excellent with no drop outs from either bud. Really disappointing as wanted these to accompany my new Galaxy Z Flip. Going to return and look at the latest Sony equivalent.,3,1,2020-2-18,1,3,0
I bought these for my son. He was happy with all aspects of the buds except for one thing...He used the tip that gave him the best performance and comfort. After using one day he noticed a hearing change in one of his ears. This hearing change gradually turned into pain. The pain got bad enough that it wouldn't allow him to sleep one night. Thinking it was probably an ear infection he saw a doctor the next day. He was quickly diagnosed with a foriegn object in his ear canal. The foriegn object was the tip from his new Samsung Buds+.,3,1,2020-6-23,1,2,0
"Sound quality isn't bad. Mic is acceptable. Nice to be able to just put one in at a time. Aside from the glossy coat, which i think make them look cheap, I like the form factor. Much more discreet than other wireless headphones.The one thing that really bugs me is the fact that the touch control is so sensitive. There is a way to turn off touch controls in the associated app for your device (i use them with an iphone, and they also easily connect to my macbook), but it doesn't always recognize whether I have it turned off or not. I usually keep it turned off, but sometimes it still accepts the touch and then other times it doesn't. So weird. I try to keep it off b/c it's so sensitive that when I go to adjust them in my ear for whatever reason, or when i go to take them out, I inevitably tap the touch controls, even when being careful not to hit it. Nearly impossible to do it. So then it either pauses or skips the track, or goes to play something I wasn't even listening to, like opening the default Music app on my iphone.",3,1,2020-8-12,1,1,0
"I stubbornly clung to my wired earbuds, and grabbed some cheap off-brand bluetooth wrap-arounds to use with yard work, but I finally decided to see what all the fuss was about with these new Buds+ models.They blew me away. I didn't expect the sound quality to be that noticeably higher. I didn't expect them to be so comfortable, or so well ""stuck"" in the ear (a major issue for working outside, or exercise), and I didn't expect the sound-passthrough to be so useful or well implemented. The touch controls are FAST and just the right amount of sensitivity. JUST MAKE SURE YOU TRY THE EXTRA SIZE FITTINGS.",5,1,2020-4-8,1,1,0
"I had high hopes for this product. Unfortunately, this set of Samsung Galaxy 345 Buds+ had extremely poor sound quality and after a few days I've finally given up and I am sending them back tomorrow to have my account credited for $143. Fwiw, no amount of ""adjusting"" the buds in my ear canals gave me any decent sound whatoever, and adjusting the ""equalizer"" was useless at best. The treble was very tinny and the bass was non-existent. If you already own a pair of these and you get DO get good-quality sound, I'm happy for you. As it is I already have two sets of Apple Airpods, including a PRO set. The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ simply don't measure up to them. No way, no how.",1,1,2020-5-11,1,2,0
"I THOUGHT THESE WERE GREAT FOR THE FIRST 50 DAYS OR SO THEY WERE. NOW THEY CAN BARELY BE HEARD I HAVE BEEN ON THE PHONE FOR DAYS TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS AND IM YET TO SPEAK WITH ANYONE WHO EVEN KNOWS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT.  I HAVE SAMSUNG EVERYTHING. THIS GOES ON AMAZON WHEN I ASK A QUESTION AND YOUR TECH PERSON REPLIES IN ALL CAPS WITH AN ! AT THE END IM DONE . IM THE CUSTOMER IM THE ONE WHO IS loosing OUT on 160 BUCKS FOR A SET OF EARBUDS THAT WORK LESS THEN A FEW MONTHS THEN ITS ALSO ME SITTING HERE ON THIS PHONE FOR 2 DAYS NOW TRYING TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE AND IT LOOKS TO ME IM ON MY OWN SO YES IM CHANGING MY REVIEW TO A NEGATIVE 5 STARS IF I COULD. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT I HAVE HAD TO PUT UP WITH FROM AMAZON IS ATROCIOUS AND IM FED UP. I went around amazon and called samsung directly they had me fixed up and ready to ship in about 5min flat.  I told them amazon had tried to contact them and they said amazon never contacts them for anything and that a lot of customers have told them that. So i believe amazon needs to find some new customer service reps. Mine acted like i interrupted them and was rude for needing help. Still mad over the yelling with caps and exclamation point for nothing more then asking a question. The second one wasnt as bad as the first one but is the one that said he needed my number incase we got cut off and then said he called Samsung but Samsung says they have no record of amazon contacting them for anything and that alot of things sold on amazon are not even covered by the Samsung warranty  but some things are and i was lucky that mine were coverd. One last thing, its a simple repair and the person at SAMSUNG was very pleasant and easy to work with she helped me and didnt act like it was an inconvenience. If amazon never clalls samsung what was the guy doing while i waited? I wonder sometimes.",5,1,2020-5-2,1,1,0
"I purchased these in February of 2020. I was satisfied with the sound quality (which was great), but I will never purchase any wireless buds from Samsung ever again for the following reasons:-It is now 6 months in and these will no longer connect to anything I own, whether it be through the SmartThings or Galaxy Wearable app. They just quit working about 5 days ago.",1,1,2020-8-20,1,2,0
"I've watched hours of YouTube reviews of earbuds to determine which ones were for me. I needed sound quality with a price under $200, decent battery life, and water resistant to a degree. Every video had positive results with the buds+. I am completely satisfied with this selection. Sound only lacks deep bass (as most earbuds do). Turning on the ambient mode offers hearing to your surroundings. You can make it a slight pick up of surrounding of noises to hearing your neighbor's conversation across the street. They're comfortable enough and don't protrude from your ears like other more expensive ones. Great earbuds.",4,1,2020-4-28,1,2,0
"This is SO DISAPPOINTING!!! I bought the red version of the Buds + and they are gorgeous, comfortable, and easy to use!....BUT absolutely awful sound quality. I tried every sound option they have on the app, then tried them with my iPhone instead of my S9 and it doesn't make a difference. They just sound bad.Even comparing them to the free wired earbuds that came with my Galaxy S9 is a joke. These sound the same as the $5 knockoff pair my wife picked up on clearance from walmart.",1,1,2020-4-24,1,3,0
"This was my first experience with true wireless earbuds, and I am quite disappointed.1) The touch controls are very sensitive which leads to a lot of accidental pauses, you may be asking why I'm touching my earbuds so much which leads to my next point.",2,1,2020-5-4,1,1,0
"sound quality isn't that impressive compared to my AirPods 2 tbh i like the sound of the airpods better, don't expect to be blown away. some pros about the galaxy buds are, better battery life, call quality is nice, and a hundred dollars cheaper over the pros. I also own the pros and like the sound quality better on those and are more comfortable, also the pros transparency mode sound more clear over the galaxy buds plus ambient mode.  the galaxy earbuds make my ears hurt. Overall, I'll recommend getting the pros if you are an ios user but if you are not looking to spend that kind of money go with these they are a great alternative.",2,1,2020-2-24,1,2,0
"So I mainly bought these for work to use on my walkie( I'm an undercover security guard and I don't like the wire hanging from my ear) My goal was to purchase a wireless transmitter, hook it up to the walkie and connect the Buds+ to the transmitter. So I did that, I bought a $20 transmitter and while at work within the first 5-10 minutes when people would talk on their walkies the Buds+ would distort their voices almost robotic/""bit-crushed"" like. The only way to stop it was to disconnect the buds and reconnect them. I ended up buying an Airfly transmitter which is like $45 and It still distorted the sound within minutes of being used. My coworker has the same transmitter but the only difference is that he uses the first gen Apple Airpods and he doesn't get that distortion as I do. I've reset the Buds+ and it still happened, I used my girlfriend's Buds+ which I bought with mine and it does it as well. I ended up trying my Bose Soundsports and the noise was gone, only issue is that these earbuds are too bulky and have a wire attached to each bud. I contacted Samsung and all they told me was to contact the company and let them know about the issue. I'm hoping it can be fixed when the next update kicks in.",3,1,2020-4-3,1,2,0
"Ok ok... So I initially wrote up a review on these earbuds when I first got them.... and when I first received these I didn't do a couple things that I should have.When you get these you have to first and foremost update the firmware, and choose the proper sized ear tip for your ear. I just put them in immediately like I did my Jabra 75 t's, and expected magic. Well I will say, even after firmware update and ear tip adjustment, these certainly do compete with the Jabra 75t sound quality. You have to go into settings and choose your preferred EQ as well, but on e you find a top that inserts these correctly, the sound is clearer than 75t's and the bass is more impactful in the galaxy +'s. I believe the Jabra 75 t's have a more compressive output on the speaker and that's what lens to it being a powerhouse earbud in regards to booming bass and thump of music. But I will say, I had frustration with my Jabra 75 t's losing connection every so often even after multiple firmware updates. When I put the Galaxy pluses on they immediately sync to my phone or whatever I'm connecting to, which turns out to be a huge improvement in my experience with bluetooth earbuds in general. The touch controls are actually growing on me after doing lawn work and not having a clean hand and having to use my forearm to tap the sensor which is very responsive and pretty stable. Overall I was one of these jump to the gun not on board Jabra 75t people that didn't want to sacrifice any loss of audio magnitude, but as I've been using these Google Galaxy plus has I've come to appreciate the ease-of-use in regards to connecting to anything seamlessly, and not having to worry loss of connection, or having to resync.",4,1,2020-6-21,1,1,0
These headphones sound great but they have so many other issues. When you go to adjust them in your ears there's buttons on the outside and it usually shuts it off or skip said or does something funky. I'm so happy they were having problem and I sent back.  I had them for almost one month. I've researched all the wireless headphones and this is my choice and it was such a flop really. Soon as I put him into my soon as I put my phone into my pocket it made the headphone so static I when I was talking with someone on the phone. Anyway I went back I research and I went with Sony wireless headphones for only a $100 on Amazon and they have been amazing they don't have all the features but I don't run in all the problems with the buttons on the outside always canceling the sound stopping it.,1,1,2020-8-1,1,1,0
These are great buds.  It's great that they come with extra wing tips and ear pieces.  For some reason my right ear is much different than my left ear when it comes to fitting of the buds.  I had to mix and match different pieces to get the right fit.At my job I need to have one ear free so I only wear one at a time. So I really can't give 5nstarsbfornnoise cancellation bc I don't use that feature.,5,1,2020-9-3,1,1,0
"I got a call from someone who mentioned that she had just gotten these. I asked her how they worked for phone calls, as I had never had luck with ANY brand. She said, clear as you please, what do you think? She was talking into them and it was perfect. I ordered some the same day, for my Galaxy 10, and so far nobody knows I'm using them or reports any problems hearing or understanding me. They also sound perfect on my side, and fit beautifully.LOVE THEM!!! WORTH THE MONEY. Oh, and music sounds great on them also üòÅ",5,1,2020-6-4,1,2,0
"Excellent buds for the price. While they don't have true active noise cancellation, I prefer the passive cancellation I get from the gel buds. The selection of different gels is very useful to ensure the perfect fit. I accidentally fell asleep with them one night because they were so comfortable and I woke up with them still in my ears, and at 12%. Not bad. If they had fallen out, the find my earbuds feature would have been very helpful to utilize. Battery life of the case isn't as good as some other brands, but you could always charge it while you listen so it's worth it for a smaller case. Battery life of the buds themselves is excellent, and to me that is what matters most. These paired seamlessly to my Galaxy Note 9, Galaxy Watch Active 2, and my Surface Pro 7 with no hassle. While my phone can't take advantage of their wireless charging case, it is convenient to leave them on my phone's charging pad, putting little effort into charging them. If you get them, I recommend getting a carrying case with a clip to protect them and to keep the case secure on a bag or your pants, although they fit very comfotably into a pocket so maybe you won't need one. So far, I haven't had any complaints so buy them for yourself if you're interested! Amazon has a great return policy if you change your mind!",5,1,2020-6-6,1,2,0
"Fantastic earbuds! I could rant on & on about how pleased I am with this purchase, but I'll stick to a few main points.First and foremost, battery life. These buds seriously last forever. I use these at work everyday for at least 3-4hours at a time, and go multiple days without charging. Unlike my last pair of off-brand bluetooth earbuds, I've never experienced the frustration of getting to work only to realize I forgot to charge them. Nor have I had them die in the middle of a several hour long podcast. The reliability is unparalleled.",5,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"I watched many good reviews on these and really wanted to try these out.  But they must be really suited for Android and not IOS.  I was able to pair them with my iPhone7 and could see them on the Galaxy app, but could not get the phone to go into headphone mode to get music out of the buds.  I tried many of the fixes I found online and couldn't get music to play in headphone mode.  The ambient feature works well and the find my ear buds feature was nice.  But the primary function of playing sounds through the ear buds didn't ever materialize.  I'm going to return them and spend the extra money on Airpods for the iPhone.",3,1,2020-3-1,1,2,0
"I bought these to replace the Apple buds I lost. I wear them to exercise. Unlike the Apple buds, I cannot keep these Galaxy Buds Plus from falling out. I‚Äôve changed the silicone inserts and followed the insertion directions I got from Samsung customer service. I switched brands because these were recommended by Consumer Reports. The sound may be a little better, but if they won‚Äôt stay in for me, I can‚Äôt use them.",2,1,2020-6-4,1,3,0
"So I tried several similar products borrowing from my friends to test and never found anything I really liked. I heard about the newest version of these being out and thought that given my past experience with the older versions this would be a good choice and so far these are by far the best buds I've ever used. Not exceptional quality like my Bose Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Headphones 700, which would be unfair since they are $400, but still a very good sound quality, very easy connection to all my devices and their app is reliable and easy to use.",4,1,2020-2-28,1,2,0
"If you spend a lot of time talking on the phone then these are a nice upgrade from the wired earbuds that come with a Samsung phone.  BUT . . . . . and it‚Äôs a big BUT . . . . . If you‚Äôre expecting to listen to music with them, forget it!  The audio quality is no better than the wired ear buds and unless you have them really jammed inside your ears, the sound quality is tinny at best.  I like the app, the battery life is really great, they‚Äôre comfortable (even for me and I struggle with earbuds, my ears usually start hurting after a while) and very convenient.  I‚Äôm just disappointed with the audio quality.  But then I have Bose QC35‚Äôs for listening to music!!  Still trying to decide if I should keep them or send them back.  It‚Äôs a lot of money to spend to be underwhelmed!",3,1,2020-5-15,1,1,0
"To preface, I've had these for only about a week now and these are my initial thoughts. I'll update this review as time goes on.First off, the sound quality is really great. They're comparable to my sony wh-1000xm3 which is double the price of these earbuds. Samsung's wearable app works extremely well with the earbuds and the features that come along with it are extraordinary. I especially like the future where you can use the app to find your earbuds by having them emit a chirping sound that I can use to track them down. This is especially important to me because I often fall asleep with them on and find that I've lost them the next morning. Speaking of that, I left them in all night to see how much battery life would be drained. The earbuds went from 95 percent charge to 75 percent. This might be different if I was listening to music all night, but as for just leaving them out, they discharge pretty slowly. They also fit very well in my ear and they're very customizable with size.",4,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"There's a lot to like about these headphones: the red looks great, the battery life is fantastic, the case is small and slim, and the fit is comfortable, even for my somewhat tiny ear canals that demands a more sensitive fit than most. On the other hand they're expensive, which is forgivable if not for one major flaw--the sound is dull and lifeless especially the bass. Perhaps in an effort to improve battery life, the earbuds do not get very loud. A pair of skullcandy sesh evo's that I bought for less than half the price of these has louder sound and more discernible bass, although I'll probably return those because of battery life and a charging case that's more like a brick. I downloaded the samsung app on my iphone and updated the buds with the latest firmware in addition to playing with the eq settings. The bass boost does nothing to the bass and only lowers the treble. I am utterly dumbfounded as to all the positive reviews on the verge, rtings, etc., extolling the sound quality with particular emphasis on the bass. Perhaps I bought some duds, perhaps there's something else I'm missing. I've played around with the fit of the various wings and tips to see if that makes a difference and it does not. If you're listening to mostly podcasts and classical music they're fine but if you're interested at all in electronica or reggae then you'll be straining to hear the bass. For half the price I would have kept them, but for this price I'll just return them in a couple of days if I don't see a marked improvement in sound quality. One pet peeve that I think is possible to get used to is the touch sensitive controls can get on your nerves as they are so sensitive the slightest attempt to adjust your buds will lead to tracks stopping and starting. Out of the box, there is no way to adjust the volume on the buds bud this is very easily reconfigured with the app. In short, I really want to keep them given the form factor, battery life and comfort, but the price is not justified by the sound quality. I foresee moving on pretty soon to another brand.",2,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0

"These aren't my first ear buds. But they're by far the best. The previous buds would do stupid things like connect to my phone from inside their case. Battery life of not very much. And getting the earbuds paired with my phone and each other was an experience all by itself.Enter the Samsung Galaxy Buds. I shuddered as I resigned myself to pairing hell when I received them. I opened the case, looked over to the instructions, saw something on my phone and turned back to a message that the buds had been paired. I didn't have to do anything. The more I use these buds, the more I like them. They are completely unobtrusive in operation. I don't have to base my use around the buds. They're just there to provide an interface between me and my phone.",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
"I just got them in today and so far I am pleased with the purchase. Great sound and listened to them for a little while with music, gaming, podcasts, etc. Tye range of sounds is dynamic though I will say some of the bass is left a little flat compared to other buds I have tried though could be overall settings I used. I have a Samsung galaxy s20+ phone and tend match my product makers for best ecosystem experience and they connected and paired seamlessly. They are also not as heavy as I am used too and the fit was great for me out of the box. With them playing, they blocked out alot of the sound, to give an idea I had a 2 and 3 year old toddlers running around screaming and it didn't really phase me. That being said, the ambient sound option in the wearable app did pull through the sounds of shrieking children rather well. I'll give a new update a couple weeks in to use just so I can give a better review.Update:21/09/2020",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,1
"First off, these are my first pair of wireless earbuds. They look great, sound great, and while the wing tips aren't very comfortable in my small ears, they are removable and are way more comfortable. The Buds came in undamaged packaging and were well protected in the box it came in. The only downside to these is if you drop the case with the earbuds inside (no matter what height they drop from,) the case will open and the earbuds will come out as well. At first, the magnet for the case seemed pretty strong, and to be fair, it still does feel strong when opening or closing. Obviously, not strong enough to keep the case closed when dropped. Other than that, these are a great pair of earbuds and I'm glad that they were my first pair.",5,1,2020-9-6,1,1,0

"I was quite disappointed at how little sound insulation I got from these earbuds!  Even with a good, snug fit, that little piece of rubber just isn't anywhere near the ability of over-the-ear headphones.  I cannot tell any difference whether adaptive cancellation is on, or not.  For any scenario dealing with the traffic noise of passing cars, the feature MIGHT AS WELL NOT BE THERE AT ALL.The sound quality is passable, in particular if you have diminished hearing in the upper ranges.  However, making room for the tweeters inside the unit takes away any sort of powerful bass.  I believe I should have gone with a different product, now -- one that employs a larger driver.  Such products are available for a lot less than I paid for this one.",3,1,2020-4-20,1,1,0
"I might be a little bias. Im a Samsung guy, love my galaxy stuff. They are better than original buds. Not a big difference in sound. The sound is always good.  The improvement is in the battery life, ambient is stronger and can be used wearing only 1 bud now. I have heard from people I talk to on the phone that the sound on there end is better. I think that's due to the extra mic on the buds+. So improvements basically extra mic for sound on your caller's end and ambient. As well as 1 bud ambient. Last, battery life on buds and case.",5,1,2020-4-6,1,2,0
"I'm obviously in the minority when it comes to these ear buds, when I say that the sound quality of the buds for listening to music is not really that great. There are others who are really liking the sound quality, which pushed me to second guess myself. My first response was ""why does the drummer sound like he's banging on cardboard boxes?"".  I googled the different ways of getting these buds to sound better than when I first put them in my ears. And, they did start to sound better. Tweaking the  Equalizer, putting the Samsung Wearables on ""Dynamic"", and what really helped was going with the larger earpiece. But, none of these came close to the Anker blue tooth earbuds that I was trying to replace. One thing I got from this experience, is that spending a bunch of money does not guarantee better quality.",3,1,2020-3-12,1,1,0

The knocks that I have for these aren't major but they keep them from being 5 stars. The push button controls on the buds are super annoying as not only do I have no use for them but they are hypersensitive to every time that I adjust them in my ear. The app demands every single permission that my phone has to offer. I'm surprised that I didn't have to give away my bank account numbers too. The max volume is the lowest that I've ever dealt with on higher end buds but at least for me it's probably a good thing. Sound quality is good especially when the buds are in the sweet spot if my ear. Tons of battery plus the case has it's own battery. Don't fall out of my ears like every other bud and headphones I've used for working out.,4,1,2020-4-30,1,1,0
"Let me get it out the way, I like these. Now that's out our way, let's dig in.... My experience with the earbuds has been mixed. I have a non 5G Galaxy Note 10+ directly from Sammy and continue to observe Bluetooth stack freezing. So earbuds, they randomly disconnect only one, mostly the right side to the tune of 3 disconnects per day. Reboot on Note didn't help/factory reset or firmware update, nada. I did re-pair the buds to no avail. Hopefully there will be a firmware update in the future That can fix these expensive devices. On the interim, I love the sound, the low latency, the battery is awesome, they also charge fast, fits snug and don't cause irritation while sweating.",3,1,2020-2-20,1,3,0

"This is the first set of Bluetooth I've owned so I can't say how these stack up compared to other brands.These were pretty easy to configure out of the box as they were immediately recognized by my Samsung S10+.

"I'd prefer old school wired Apple ear buds any day over the bluetooth stuff, unfortunately, that's not an option on many modern devices.  I got the Galaxy buds when they first came out,  they fit amazingly, very comfortable, and also worked as an ear plug when not listening to audio.  I recently ""upgraded"" to the Buds Live, and although they sound amazing, the ergonomics are terrible, if they are even slightly out of position, sound quality plummets, and they can easily shift just by moving your jaw.  After a week or so i found out that Samsung also had the Buds + model that actually produced better sound quality than the new Live buds and had the same old fit that i loved, so i got them and i have not been disappointed! i compared all 3 models, buds, buds +, and buds live.  the Buds + and Buds live were similar in sound quality and much better than the standard buds.

Sound quality and cancellation was a stop up from my AirPods. In fact the noise cancellation is to good and I can't hear my wife which causes other problems.

"Let me start off with saying I have owned many different headphones and earbuds. These are great wireless earbuds really, but everyone knows the good: long battery life, decent sound, fast charge times etc. Heres the bad; the batteries while lasting long dont really last 11 hours per charge. Its more of like 8-9 whether it's music or sleeping on calls. There is a slight lag between screen and audio even with the gaming mode feature in labs so that kind of disappointing. I use these mainly for discord calls on my phone. Discord acts weird with these. It will treat the call as a phone call at first and the sound quality goes down alot. Sometimes even sound fading out. If you double tap the earbud (which would end a normal phone call) the sound becomes perfect again however the mic changes to your phone rather than your earbud which is quite strange. For the most part they work fine though. Not great but fine. The mic on the buds sound like pretty much every other wireless earbuds out there. The ambient mode sounds tinny but works well. The connection is stable most of the time but there were a couple times the connection was glitching out so the earbud would sound like its losing connection (even the my phone is like less than 2ft away) whenever i switch to snapchats camera it changes the phones audio output to the phone speaker for some reason and I find myself repairing these alot. Bottom line they're great for listening to music and stuff but not so great at other stuff. Sync problems, call quality loss and connectivity issues.

I love how the touch responses are also customizable, especially the volume control on the edge of the buds, while leaving the touchpad for other things.

Likewise if you're eating, the person on the other end of the phone call can hear you're chewing crunchy things, obviously.If buds are lost, You can find your earbuds with the app, however if your buds are in their case and closed, it does not work . It only works when the earbuds are out of the case... wish it worked both ways. I haven't had them in water but I have gotten sweaty with them in and haven't had any issues. Bass is awesome for music too.",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0

"Surprisingly good sound quality, with bass and treble response good.  The battery seems to last a long time I have yet to run it down to below 50% before putting them back into the case and the case charging them back to full is convenient.  Comfortable in the ear during use,  using default attachments, this can vary so make sure you try the different sizes.I have a galaxy S8+ phone and I did have to change the advanced bluetooth setting ""Media Volume Sync"" to ON in order to get good volume, with this setting off it was half of what it should have been.  Once done it sounded great.",5,1,2020-2-27,1,1,0
"So these have a lot going for them. They look nice, they're comfortable, the build quality seems high, the batteries last more than long enough for me, and they sound really good in the ideal conditions. So why the one star review?That ideal condition for good sound is basically sitting perfectly still with you phone close to the buds because the Bluetooth connectivity with these is really terrible. I've had 15 dollar off-brand ear buds with better Bluetooth connectivity. This renders all the positives I listed before pointless. Literally the second you put your phone in your pocket or start moving around you start hearing distortions in the sound from the Bluetooth signal. I've tried with multiple phones (my own phone, Pixel 3A+ and a family member's Galaxy S10 Plus) and it makes no difference. The problem is the buds. You can't work out with these, you can't run with these, you can't even walk around the house with these. They're useless.",1,1,2020-7-21,1,1,0
"I use these ear buds a lot, not only for music, but to take conference calls all day long for work.  I really hoped that these would be more comfortable than they are, but using the medium sized covers, my ear gets sore really fast, but using the small sized covers, while feeling more comfortable, they fall out of my ear after a few minutes.  I'm not sure what to do.  Naturally, shortly after I purchased these, the brand new Samsung ear buds were announced.  While those look even more comfortable, I'm not thrilled at the idea of shelling up more cash to replace these already.",3,1,2020-8-30,1,1,0
"These are my first earbuds.  I think they will be fine for me since I mostly listen to podcasts and very little music.  But, when it comes to music they lack deep base and the depth you would expect from a quality sound system.  I have tried to adjust the sound using the ""wearable"" settings but base boost is just not enough and the equalizer of music apps just cannot add the desired base...  If you are looking for quality sound these may not be the earbuds for you, but the best are more expensive.",3,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
"I keep these on me daily, even at work. The battery life is phenomenal, lasting all through the day outside of the charging case. The buds also charge fairly quickly. Being able to use one bud while the other is in the case is a nice touch. These buds are very comfortable, and the wing tips help keep them secure in your ear. I appreciate the low profile of the buds, I don't really want something obnoxious and large.There is NO active noise cancellation, only passive (the seal created by the rubber tips). This isn't a problem for me, I don't want active noise cancellation and at this price point it probably shouldn't be expected. The passive noise cancellation does just fine anyway, although I usually have the ambient sound feature on anyway so I can interact with people at work.  The ambient sound feature works fairly well. It seems to favor higher pitched sounds, as that's what comes out more clearly (even going so far as to being able to hear female voices more clearer than a deep male's voice). Still, it allows me to be more aware of my surroundings when I need to while enjoying music.",4,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
Things were working fine for the first 3 months after charging one day I noticed that the right earbud had become very quiet almost inaudible with the left ear bud in.  I followed all of Samsung's debugging steps to fix the problem and when nothing worked I decided to call their customer support. At first the support team was very helpful and assured me that the product was under warranty and sent me a shipping label for me to use to send in for repairs.  A few days after I shipping them out claiming that they had received my galaxy buds at the repair center but the warranty was void and I actually OWED them $109 for the repairs. After getting screwed around and bouncing from call to call by the Samsung support people for over 2 hours I finally found out that the warranty was void because it was bought from AMAZON and apparently was an international version of the product.  Had I known this I never would have sent them in for repairs but would have contacted amazon.  Now not only am I out the 1 bud that worked I have to pay Samsung to receive them back!!! While I do like the product itself when it worked I would strongly advise not purchasing this product from Amazon but rather through Samsung directly,1,1,2020-9-9,1,1,0
"I must say, the plus buds are considerably better that their predecessor. I don't really think they are that much louder, but they sound so much better. The ambience setting on these things are amazing. Today was my first full day and I kept both in all day at work and had no problems. The battery is a huge happy factor. When I got home, some 11-12 hours later, I had recharged the buds and I had 44 percent on the case. Worthy upgrade.",5,1,2020-2-17,1,2,0
"I planned to listen to music. Maybe a podcast or 2. But I opened the shipping box to a beautiful white sparkly Buds+ box. Get all excited! Mind you the factory tape was already cut open. Didn't think to much of it besides im pretty sure I ordered new not used ones. Well it dont matter. The buds, case, charging cord was non existence. Only thing the savages left was the instructions. Luckily Amazon is amazing and is sending a new pair that will arrive tomorrow!Got new pair the very next day and they are amazing headphones! From sound to fit all around best Bluetooth headphones anyone could ask for. 11hr battery life with 2 extra charges stored in the case. They fit so good im the ear im able to go for a ride on my harley with no windshield doing 80mph without them budging at all! Highly recommend buying Samsung over the Airpods!",5,1,2020-8-2,1,1,0
"With passive noise cancellation, the vacuum created from the earbuds gives a sense of security during workouts and exercise.  Sweat resistance is good enough.  I took these with me running, playing basketball at the court or on the playground, and had no problems having them stay in my ear.  Great sound for the price.  They pair flawlessly with the Samsung Gear app on my Samsung S20 plus, S10 plus, and/or Note 10 plus.  The app offers enough control and features to feel good about being in total control.  The different sound EQ settings on the Samsung Gear app gives nice noise signature variations.  For my taste, I'm good with DYNAMIC.Overall, especially now, the price is irresistible particularly in the Samsung ecosystem.",5,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"These buds work great when paired with my galaxy phone. They also fit pretty well. Sweating during workouts has not been an issue. The sound blocks out the bad pop music blasting in the gym. I gave 4 stars for the following reasons.1. When doing Bluetooth pairing with my lapto, the audio drivers become corrupted. This has never happened with any other Bluetooth headset/speaker. This was vetted and tested several times by my IT department at the headphones were deemed to be the root cause. Not useful in this new age of constant Zoom meetings.",4,1,2020-7-11,1,1,0
"I bought these to replace my Blitzwolf FE-7s.  It's not even a very good comparison given the price difference (I ordered direct from China), but none-the-less, I've always been a sucker for trying to find the best ChiFi challenger to whatever the mainstream audio is doing.I have never had a single problem with my Galaxy Buds Plus.  Not one, no dropping, no connection problems, nothing.  I love them so much, that after getting my son some highly rated TRANYA T10s, which we both agreed were complete trash compared to the Blitzwolf's as far as SQ (the Blitz were starting to glitch though), I opted to see if I could get a bargain on the GBP.  Amazon Warehouse had a stellar deal on an Open Box for $62...which puts them in slightly higher, albeit direct competition with the best of ChiFi.",5,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
"Love: sound quality, connectivity, commands, reading messages, that my family dont have to say what? I cant hear you well! on phone calls. Ambient sound, it works terrific, it can be abit loud at the beginning, but you get used to it. The greatest thing about it it's that I dont have to take them off when I go to my customer, and this has made the experience with these Samsung buds plus even more amazing.I wish: eventhough the speakers are way better than the last year model, more improvements on them will make them perfect. But I love this buds plus the technology on these little bluetooth is amazing and obviously 100 cheaper than the new airpods pro, I like the design better than the airpod pro's. They stay on my ears well eventhough I'm up and down and moving for 9 hrs at work, plus battery life amazing. I'm considering a pair for my wife, but they need to come down at least 30 dollars.",5,1,2020-3-6,1,1,0
"These are my first earbuds, so I cannot compare them with others.  However, I can compare them with my wired earphones.The multiple ear shape plugs and sizes are great.  Enough variety, they should fit everyone comfortably.",4,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
Good True Wireless Earbuds All In All. Only issue I have had is tryin to find the right size earbud plugs and wings that work for me but so far I have only tried the smallest and medium ones. Think I may have to try to use the medium earbud plugs with the small wings havent tried yet but will give an update afterwards. (Update) so I personally had to use the smallest ear wings and the medium earbud plugs and have had little to no discomfort... But I am having trouble with the left earbud loosing charge faster the the right and it also keeps cutting the sound in and out to were I can barely hear anything out of it? I am returning or getting an exchange or getting a replacement because I absolutely love these earbuds but sadly I think there maybe a manufacturer malfunction with these ones and just to be safe I asked for the replacement or exchange,3,1,2020-7-2,1,1,1
"Let me start by saying that I have been a consumer of Samsung products for a long time. I purchase their televisions, their cell phones, and household appliances. However, with the purchase of these headphones, my faith in them is beginning to diminish. These are without a doubt, the most useless, shoddy headphones on the market right now. They have advertising that makes them seem like the bee's knees, but they perform more like complete and utter garbage. The sound quality dips in and out, they lose connection to any device I attempt to connect them to, and you cannot even place your phone in your front pocket without it disrupting the signal to the headphones. These things should not be sold to consumers at this price. Save your money, since you're better off buying a $15 Chinese knockoff.",1,1,2020-5-29,1,2,0
"Update:  I finally had enough and contacted Samsung support (a week after using the on-line support to trouble shoot).  They sent me a shipping label to to return them and will be sending me a new pair.  Original Post: I have had these for about a month now and was initially satisfied with them (even recommended them to a coworker).  However, over the last week every time I take a call they will disconnect from the phone (as if I had taken them out).  I have to remove them and then put them back in for them to connect.  Depending on the length of the call, they will disconnect several times.  I have tried resetting them and clearing cache from my phone, but it still occurs.  Sometimes I have to go back to wired headphones depending on the importance of the call.",3,1,2020-5-4,1,1,0
First impression.. five stars.. ambient mode is insane. I've had the old Galaxy buds for about 8 months now daily use and these out of the box are blowing it away with both sound quality and ambient sound.My wife always complains about phone quality from my old buds. We will test that and I will get back to you with that opinion later.,5,1,2020-2-16,1,2,0
"Pros: Has great features. Good battery.Cons: Have to install Galaxy Wearable app to get the most out of it, lags and pauses a lot with non Samsung devices, notably my Lenovo pc.

"So I have the regular Galaxy Buds, and the Jabra Elite 75T Active. I mostly listen to my earbuds at work, usually in one ear, but when I'm out and about I'll have both in. However the Galaxy Buds didn't last through out the day, and the Jabra Elite's actually had even worse battery life than the original Galaxy Buds despite claiming otherwise. Jabra's sounded much better no contest however.I upgraded to the Galaxy Buds+ Hoping to find a medium between the two. To my surprise it really doesn't sound any better at least to my ears than the regular Galaxy Buds, so if that is your sole reason for upgrading I wouldn't do it. It also isn't any louder than the originals. However it does have other features that I enjoy quite a bit. In the option menu you can turn on gaming mode, which eliminates audio delay pretty well. It also has an option to turn the ambient mode up even higher than normal. Much higher than the original Buds, and the Jabras. Another thing that you can do that you couldn't do in the original is use ambient mode with only one ear bud in your ear. Perfect for when I'm at work. However I only recommend doing this with the right ear bud, I think that is the only bud with the extra microphone. (It works fine with both in however)",5,1,2020-3-29,1,1,0

"Using Flossy Carter's ranking system on a scale of 1-10 these are a triple major go. The battery on these is no joke with 11 hours on the buds alone and 22 hours with the case. Also, call quality on these are great with everything sounding clear you should have no problems taking a call with these and with ambient sound you could listen to music and still here what's going on around you which is great. Now, this could vary from person to person but for me these are comfortable which is perfect for long listening sessions but your mileage may vary. All in all these are great buds for the price and would highly recommend.",5,1,2020-2-21,1,3,1
"After having them for 1 week, I would rate these 4 stars out of 5. The sound quality is excellent and the ability to customize each sides function is more useful than I originally thought it would be. The ambient sound feature comes in handy, especially as a delivery driver. Being able to switch from hearing nothing to hearing customers and co-workers without having to remove the earbuds is very convenient.  The ear buds have had a few problems, but nothing major. First, and this has only happened twice, is that the earbuds will be out of sync.  One earbud will be a few seconds ahead of the other and the only way to fix it I've found is to put them back in the case and wait a minute before using them again. The second issue is occasionally the earbuds will make music come through sound slightly robotic. I'm not sure how to describe it other than that. This only lasts a few seconds at a time and doesn't happen too often. They also randomly switch playlists on Spotify, I haven't had this happen with any other earbuds and it's nothing more than a slight inconvenience. One issue that was almost unbearable was the notifications. They worked perfectly on the first day, but by day 2 it started reading my notification non stop. I would receive a snapchat, and it would repeat ""Snapchat"" endlessly. I ended up turning notifications off and haven't turn them on since.  Lastly, they do get uncomfortable to wear for any more than 45 minutes to an hour. I'm not sure if intentional or not, but whenever I remove one of the earbuds from my ear, spotify will either pause the music playing, or resume it if paused. This is useful when I have music playing and it pauses it when I remove an earbud, but if the music is paused and gets resumed when I remove an earbud it just doesn't make sense and it annoying when I have to re-pause the music. I would like to see more functions for the touch pads in the future, maybe like a certain tap pattern that allows the user to lock and unlock the earbuds, rather than having to go into the app to do so. Overall a very good product and I would recommend getting them.",4,1,2020-2-24,1,1,0
"The left earbud has a good strong sound, but the right earbud is weak and faint. There are no instructions as to how to balance the sound. So these were basically non-function on arrival after charging them. Also, the controls are way too sensitive - if you touch them even slightly it will trigger a track change - and so adjusting them in any way while they are in your ear is basically impossible. I doubt I'll buy samsung again.",1,1,2020-8-29,1,1,0
"These buds were great for the first couple months, then the sound quality/volume started to fade and even after thorough cleaning they never worked the same. After the right earbud died completely, I sent them into Samsung for warranty repair/replacement, but they said due to ""damage"" that it voided the warranty and would cost me $108 to repair them. I never got them wet or abused them, I'm unaware of any ""damage"" done to them beyond the right bud stopping completely and the left bud having low volume. I'm having them sent back as is, since I could buy a new pair at that rate. Really disappointed in the longevity of this product, as I looked forward to using them for a long time, especially with such a high price and ""good"" warranty.",1,1,2020-9-17,1,1,0
I've owned the buds+ since May and while the features are great the quality in time has diminished. My left ear piece volume is really low and wont match the right side in loudness for whatever reason and randomly out of no where.

"I bought these and they were great until one stopped working after 2 months, no problem it's under warranty. Well Samsung will not honor the warranty for this product if purchased from Amazon because they will not consider it a certified vendor.

"I had the old Samsung Galaxy Buds. These new ones are a certain UPGRADE. Granted the sound quality is almost the exact same (slightly more crisp, slightly better bass, slightly better overall) but if you're looking to have much better ambient sound AND call quality, these are the perfect upgrade. Especially with a slight increase of $20.The only real complaint I have is the feel the new case has. It's more plastic-y and the hinge feels rather cheap. A nitpicky observation.",5,1,2020-2-16,1,3,0
Owned the original Galaxy Buds and AirPods.  These are only a slight sound upgrade from the previous Galaxy Buds.  They are considerably lighter and the battery life is significantly longer.  The bigest difference from the original is the call quality.  The caller won't be able to tell the difference in you having the phone to your ear.  Compared to the AirPods they're more comfortable and sound better.  You really can't compare these to AirPod Pros because they are in a different proce category.,5,1,2020-3-12,1,2,0
"Great sound quality for the price (compare airpods pro: $250). No noise canceling, but I'm ok with that. Connecting to my phone couldn't be easier. Battery life is good enough with the case. I use ear buds an average of 9-10 hrs a day, and putting the buds in the case (giving my ears a break) after 4-5 hrs, I can finish my days use with some battery to spare.The ambient sound feature works ok. It gives a tinny sound to your surroundings and is very noisy out in the wind. I don't know how you could expect a better sound honestly.",4,1,2020-5-10,1,0,0

After 2 weeks, they started losing connection to my phone, muffle sound and make me hear robots and people were not able to hear me well very frequently.The left battery started to drain much quicker than the right one and I need to charge them more frequently. The ambiant sound feature is super cool, but sometimes you hear the air passing by, specially after I upgraded their software.",2,1,2020-4-23,1,1,0

I searched online and saw SO MANY POSTS of people complaining about the same thing - which is odd, since you don't hear about that with any other earbuds.  From what I could tell from just the right earbud, the sound quality seems good, so I'm really disappointed.Secondary issue is that the charging cord wasn't in the box.  I could live with that - but not only ONE earbud working.",1,1,2020-7-10,1,1,0

I also have the Jabra Elite Active 65t buds, and while they are much older, they sound significantly better for music and work MUCH better for MS Teams meetings for work. Hated how my voice sounded on the Samsung buds, robotic. The most annoying thing about these buds are the finicky touch controls. They rarely work. These also had trouble pairing with the iPhone. Finally, the battery didn‚Äôt last anywhere near 11 hours, but that might be because my ‚Äúlike new‚Äù buds were, in fact, quite worn. I‚Äôll stick with Jabra.",2,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0

One of my favorite features is the ambient sound feature! I dont have to take my earbuds out when someone talks to me as their voice is pushed through to my earbuds!

Could only be paired with one bluetooth component at a time. Bought mainly for working out and listening to tv . They paired with my Samsung tv quickly, but I was unable to increase volume while watching tv.

Battery life is great and the sound is incredible due to the customizable Wearable App from Samsung. The fit is perfect. They feel very light in the ear and the comfort is a welcome change from most other earbuds. I strongly recommend these for purchase and, unless you're the type to constantly loose your buds, these are well worth the investment. The red version I bought looks sexy and sharp. I listen to everything from Audiobooks to rock, Bach to blues, symphonic to Broadway. Every genre is well suited for these buds The sale price of $130 was a real enticement. As the newer versions come out on the market, the price is likely to drop even more.  Snatch these up before they discontinue them!!!",5,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"I have used a lot of different wireless ear buds. From other vendors, what I can say is after using them all the Samsung buds were and still remain my favorite. You will hear complaints of missing premium features like built in mp3 player with out your phone and such non-sense, honestly all those features are silly. At the end of the day I am rarily with out my phone within arms reach, and even less do I leave with out it. With these headsets, I have them paired to anything with Bluetooth, they connect easily seamlessly, they stay in my ears and sound great regardless of what activities I am doing.

"Seriously, where have these been? I feel so free with this product. I can walk around without having to worry about being attached to a wire or cord. These are (obviously) my first wireless bluetooth ear buds. I am not an expert on sound quality or other technical aspects of this product, but they meet my needs and then some. They fit snug in my ears and even come with several sizes of rubber ear pieces in case one size doesn't fit in your ear. I've used them working out as well as around the house doing things like washing dishes and cleaning and they have not fallen out of my ears. I am paranoid about that, though, so I do push them in every once in a while to make sure they are going to stay put.  I feel like the range is wide as well. I sometimes leave the room where my phone is and they are still working all over the house or at the gym. The ONLY thing that's annoying is that there are features on the side of each ear bud that if you press it, pauses your music. I have to make sure that I push around that area when I push them back in my ears otherwise my music will pause. Other than that and the fact that nothing is perfect, especially electronic items, (hence the 4 stars), these things are great.",4,1,2020-7-11,1,1,0
"I can't hype these up enough. I wanted to invest in a good pair of true wireless headphones for awhile now and I did days upon days of research. All of the reviews said to try Jaybird, the Jabra earphones, and there were also other cheaper ones rated well. Well let me tell you...these are BY FAR THE BEST. Don't waste your money on anything else.They fit perfectly and aren't uncomfortable. They don't go so far in your ear that you feel pressure (I felt this when I wore the Jaybird buds). They have different sizes of attachments for the earbud that you can use if they seem to move around a bit. I decided to go with the biggest sizes and they fit so perfectly.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
The base quality was poor. My wired yurbuds are better. I tried every trick on the internet and even contacted Samsung directly but nothing made them satisfactory. Noise cancellation really only works with over-the-ear headphones.I returned them.,3,1,2020-7-27,1,1,0
"I purchased these back in july. I have been using them since then. I done a little bitnof research as far as the Specs are concerned and these seem like the Buds+ and the Buds are the same as far as sound quality and battery time. Every charge up on each ear bud gives me only 5 to 8 hours before another recharge (5 hours music time, talk time, and youtube combined back to back and 8 hours not really using it at all).To be honest, I think what I received was different from what was actually purchased.",3,1,2020-9-3,1,1,0
"Great battery life with a pretty good sound too. I have better sounding headphones sure, but these things are in my ears almost all day at work. I just set up the ambient noise thing so if someone needs to talk to me I can hear them without taking them out and I'm good. They're comfortable and actually pretty small for having such a crazy battery life and much smaller than the airpods, the Sony early 2000 Bluetooth earpiece look or the giant looking Sennheiser buds that only last 4 hours. I've tried the airpods and the Sennheiser and the airpods pro are definitely not worth their price and although the Sennheiser buds probably have the best sound that I've heard from a wireless bud, 4 hours is just not nearly enough for me.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"I am giving these a 2 star, but that is a reach.  The right bud quit working after 5 months.  I tried all the ""fixes"" to no avail.

So my search for wireless ear buds continues.  So far, 0 out of 2 have been satisfying.  I have 2 pairs that have a wire connecting left to right.  One is fair, but no bass.

"So first off, I've only had them 2 days. But I just couldn't wait to review them. So I've had two pairs of samsung level bluetooth headphones. I've had the level u and the level active. Both are great, but the buds plus are way better. The pictures make them look so huge, but they are so tiny. Even the case is tiny. Way smaller than the samsung level actives, but with almost twice the battery without the case. The sound is amazing. Features galore. The ambient sound feature is absolutely amazing for a work environment. I haven't pushed the batteries to the limit. I do work an 9 hour day. I have the ambient sound on high and listen two about two albums throughout the day on top of calls. I had about 35% in each left (34% left 36% right). Once you get them fitted correctly the sound is excellent and loud. Worth every penny. Pairs well with a galaxy watch and s10 plus!",5,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"I bought these buds to replace a pair of 2 year old Gear IconX that I've been having serious problems with. I'm VERY happy with my purchase. These buds are smaller and fit my ears more comfortably for long use. The sound quality is far superior and the noise cancellation is almost total. I've been working from home with 2 kids, so being able to block out their noise during conference calls has been clutch. I also use them when I run, but they don't hold up to sweat very well as anticipated. I have to keep pressing them back in my ears. I might have to use the provided fins to hold them in place, but that's not a dealbreaker for me. Great little earbuds. I highly recommend them.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"After researching for a week obsessively, I went with the the Galaxy buds plus. Now I have used them on average 6 hours a day for 2 weeks now and j absolutely love them. I have walked, jogged, hiked, and biked in them. The ambient passthrough mode is literally a life saver and probably the best out there. The battery life is unreal and the case battery is so small it goes unnoticed in my pocket.Color, feel, ease of touch functions and comfort make them easy to use all day. My only negative issues  would be the silicone tips. I had trouble getting a good deal with any size. This was easily remedied with taking the old ones off my previous pair. Problem solved. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for a crisp clean sound and all day battery and comfort. (I have heard of other users having low bass issues but with the app and your phones setting this was a kon issue for me, actually find the sound almost 3D and deep)",5,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0

"At first, I was disappointed in the sound quality and comfort of these earbuds. Considering the price, I was expecting more. However, I ran across an article that compared sound quality and comfort of various devices. Surprisingly, it all boiled down to the silicone ear tips. The ones that came with the Galaxy earbuds were not providing the quality I wanted. I experimented with tips from various earbuds I own and finally found a pair that was snug and comfortable. That definitely solved the sound quality and comfort issues with the Galaxy design of their eartips. So if you purchase these earbuds, be prepared to swap out the ear tips and you won't be disappointed in this product.",4,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"There are 2 options when using these in windows 10: stereo and hands free. Stereo sounds better, but doesn't work consistently when using full screen games. Sound is working, open the game, sounds cuts off. I need to switch to hands free and get sound, but it's tinny and not ideal. Also, there is audio delay when watching videos on the computer. I just wanted a simple bud that I can use in just one ear while using my computer and for the most part, these do the trick.I only used it briefly on my phone and works fine. It's probably designed more for use with your phone than computer, but I feel it should work perfectly that way, too.",3,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0

"So far, so good!  The one and only negative is the touch controls on the ear buds.  The ""how to"" explanation is too subtle for me to grasp.  I eventually turned the feature off using the App.  I control the volume via the App.  That said, they are comfortable.  The sound is very good.  The charger case works well.  I use them for listening to music and for telephone calls.  Given that my biggest complaint about other wireless earbud that I've owned is the poor battery life, I'll reserve comment in that regard until I've owned these for at least six months.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,1,0

In the end, from what I've seen and can attest to, the Samsung Buds+ has the best sound quality, design, battery life (11hrs), and best of all value.Honestly, the only issue I've had with these has been comfort, specifically in my right ear. In other words, I can't speak for any other than myself in this regards. that said I still wanted to give my piece of mind.

"These earbuds are amazing. They are super comfortable and just stay in the ear. Sound quality is great. Be forewarned that they do not work in skype for business calls, which was why I bought them and the reason for a 3 star review. After 15 minutes into a Skype call, the mic stops functioning and you can no longer be heard. I have posted in the Samsung community and no resolution.",3,1,2020-3-15,1,3,0
"These buds + are seriously amazing. The stuff you can do with them is awesome. The sound, at first, was a little disappointing.  But then I realized I didn't have a tight seal with the size eartips that come installed on the buds. I switched them out for a size bigger and instantly the buds came to life. The noise cancelling is top notch for when you want to escape your surroundings. And when you need to be able to hear your surroundings, turn the ""ambient sound"" on to 1 of the 3 levels and you'll be able to hear cars coming from behind you if out exercising,  or even be able to hear things at a magnified level if you put the ambient on the highest setting.

"These fit great in my ear, and feel great, and sounded decadent. The only problem I had (because I had to return them) was my ears are very sensitive and after only maybe 10-15 mins of use, my ears started to hurt inside my ear canal. Something I've never experienced with OVER the ear headphones. I thought it was maybe cuz I wasn't used to them because these were my first set of earbuds, but every time I used them, my ear canal would hurt. Do after only 2 or 3 days I had to return them, and kept using my BOSE QC35II and no issues.. Because those don't go in my ear. So I would say if your have sensitive ears, DO NOT buy earbuds",3,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"The feedback you get from the earbuds is pretty bad. You need to tap (or hold? I'm not really sure) to enable the mic during calls,  but the only feedback you get when either turning it on or off is a simple beep and I can't really tell when it's being turned on or off.I tried to test it in a sound recorder, but guess what? You don't actually get the option to use the mic outside of calls! So I can't even test it outside of calls. In calls, I'm told I sound fuzzy. For how expensive these are, and the fact that this is Samsung's answer to the Airpods, I'm really disappointed.",3,1,2020-6-9,1,1,0

"The sound quality is very good. Good bass, and treble. The mids can lack with certain genres, but still good. Some might be better, but not without spending twice as much. The ambient sound detection is a very nice feature. These are the most comfortable earbuds I've tried. With the different sized tips and wing tips, you can get a perfect, snug fit. They don't come loose under any circumstances I've encountered.  Combined with a Samsung phone, it's a seamless product. Even though the charging case doesn't hold a ton of recharges, 11 hours on a single charge more than makes up for it. Even if you don't have a Samsung phone, the play store app is great for controlling these.",5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
These ear buds exceeded my expectations.  In addition to having excellent sound quality I love that I can adjust the amount of ambient sound that I want.  Also they are so comfortable that I actually forget that I have them in and they stay put.  I had a pair with the ‚Äústem‚Äù and they would pop out if I brushed against them and the stems just hanging out of my ears looked stupid as hell!  These fit right into the ear and actually look cool.  I got them in white because I think they will be easier to find than dark colored buds.  Easy and fast recharge and I have not had the batteries run out even after wearing them for hours on end.,5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
These are the best I ever had after owning 3 other wireless ear buds. The sound is the best. The noise cancelling is the best. The battery life is supper! 11 hours! I only have to charge them once and they are good for me most of the day.  If I need them for longer than 11 hours I only have to put them in the case for a half hour or less and keep on going. The best ear buds ever. I am so satisfied with my purchase. With that being said. These are the only ones that have occasionally popped out of my ear after long time use. So I adjust them every now and then to make sure they are secure. I don't know if it is because I have not found that sweet spot when adjusting them to my ear yet. It only happens every now and then. Not enough to bother me. I hope they improve on that with the next model. I have had these for at least a month now. It happened twice and I use them everyday all day. Not bad.,5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"These sound loads better than the original Galaxy Buds, which I actually liked.  The fit is the same, and is comfortable despite being inside the ear.  The nubs hold them firmly within the ear; I have never once had these fall out of my ears - which is a common problem for me with earbuds, especially those that don't go inside the ear.  No active noise cancellation but the sound isolation is good enough in most scenarios.  The ambient mode is great and I love that you can auto-enable that for phone calls.  If you own a Samsung phone, these are a must-have, and I'd honestly recommend them even to those that have Pixel, LG or other phones.",5,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"This have been a pleasure to use when jogging and being out and about for fitness. They stay put in your ear, although sometimes they get a bit heavy (after 2hrs+ of wear) and I can't wait to remove them. They are surprisingly super portable and durable.The sound quality for Bluetooth is fantastic and I don't have much complaints here! However, I have been spoiled by the sound on my Sennheiser Movement, the lack of richness in the base or the nuances of the treble is apparent in these Galaxy buds and can get a bit lost. I've had to fiddle with the preset selection quite a bit to match the sound profile I prefer to listen to.",4,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"I was incredibly excited when I received these, but I had a hard time trying to download the app that allows you to customize these.

With that being said, I still love them - the sound quality is good, could be better if I was able to use the app, but hey maybe I'll eventually upate my phone. Just make sure to read ALL the fine print before making purchases. I've had these for over a month and use them almost daily for several hours, I've never ran out of battery life and the case still charges... so far.",4,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"I wanted these especially for using with Zoom. These are so comfortable I often forget they are in my ears. The sound is excellent, and others say they hear me clearly.

When listening to music, you can tap to go to next track or pause. There's still a lot for me to learn about them.",5,1,2020-6-14,1,1,0
"Honestly the best earbuds you can get for a galaxy phone that aren't hundreds of dollars. They last for a very long time and charge in the case very fast. The case is small and convenient to keep in your pocket all day. Using just one earbud works very well. The ambient sound feature is not exactly what I thought it was and can pickup on other sounds than someone talking, however it is not a big deal.",5,1,2020-6-14,1,1,0
These are a really nice pair of headphones. I was super hesitant to get make the jump to wireless as I was worried about charging and things but these really take the hassle out of it. The battery life on these is great and has really taken the stress of that out of the situation with the charging case and long life.Samsung has done a really good job partnering the these with their existing tech. The wireless charging on my phone is super nice.,5,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"Overall great choice. Very happy. I constantly keep a bud in one ear. Tried to share with my girlfriend, who has small ears--the bud doesn't fit well in her small ear, due not to the ear-canal rubber portion being too large, but the body of the bud itself is too large to fit into the concha of the ear (the area of your ear just outside your ear canal where the body of this earbud rests. Yes, I had to look that word up.) So keep this in mind if you have small outer ears.Infinitely more comfortable than the airpod v1. One other note--yes they work with iphone, but unless you can find an Android device to download the paired app, you will be unable to change the core function of holding down the earbud. Default is call your voice assistant.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"I'm normally pretty picky about my music. I've had many earbuds and they've all been disappointing. Picked up the Galaxy Buds + as it seemed to have excellent reviews. My Buds+ arrived today and I installed the Wear app on my Galaxy Note 9. For me, I had to change out the ear canal inserts to get a nice fit. These buds are very comfortable...unbelievable.  I normally use Amazon Music since it seems to have much better sound than Pandora. I fired up some music and could not believe how nice these sound. They have an excellent, clear and clean sound quality. Bass is surprisingly very nice, not overpowering, but it's there. Once I got the buds fitting nice and the app set, the music is just incredible.  Also, the battery life is amazing. Currently, I'm on my first charge and I'm at 5 hours and only at 70%. The range is great, I got about 50-60 feet away before it started skipping. For this price point, there is nothing that's going to sound better than the Buds+.  Nice job Samsung!!!  Just buy them....you won't be disappointed.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
I like that they fit inside my ear as oppose to hanging out of your ear. It has that slick low-key design to it. People can't really tell you have them on until they get up close to you. The battery last me all day and I work 12 to 14 hours shift. There's no noise cancelation on these if that's what you're looking for. But the ambient sound on these are the best. It's almost like you're having superman hearing. I had the first Gen and then I upgraded to these ones when they first came out. So far these do not disappoint me.,5,1,2020-7-4,1,1,0
"I purchased this product in March 2020 and not even a year later the right ear bud won't hold a charge at all. I have cleaned out the case and there is no damage to the product. I have called Amazon for a replacement since I use them for work and school and figured that since I had also purchased the protection plan(3 yr coverage) that I should be ok. Not! I was bounced from the amazon rep,to tech support, to Samsung rep and then the Samsung supervisor. No one at any given time was willing to offer a replacement but wanted me to send them in to be fixed(2 week turn around) and I informed them that this wasn't possible. The only other option given to me was to drive out of my way to go to their chosen store to get them fixed. It was made clear to me that their convenience and need outweighed my own as the customer.I will not be purchasing another Samsung product. 3 stars.",3,1,2020-7-14,1,1,0

I do have apple products so I do have the ipods the regular ones so it was a no brainer to get both. Ipods clearly don't work the best with Android so stick with the buds if you do.

The phone sounds very well and people on the other end say I come through very clear without picking up noise. Haven't talked with them on outside so don't know about wind. Usually I can walk quite a ways away from device I'm connected to without losing connection. Have been a couple of days I could not go far. Might be because of not being fully charged. Noticed that when they are fully charged no problems. I do have interference going out to garage from the kitchen which I lose connection.

Better setup with the Galaxy Gear app. Massively improved voice recognition for voice commands through headphones. I cannot say enough good things about these.

I can enable pass through when needed by a long touch and talk to my coworkers. The touch controls are really good too giving you a lot more control over these than airpods. Battery life is a big sell here for me. They can last a 10 hour work day when my airpods were dead before lunch.,5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"I have an issue with earbuds. They usually hurt or won't stay put for too long, and are heavy in the ear. AKG has so far made the only ones I like with the ones that come with the phones when you buy them (hardcore Galaxy fan here), but they're wired and I never thought I could get an earbud that I really liked.I saw AKG makes these and that was the selling point for me. I got them, immediately put them in and was not disappointed. They fit my small ears well. So let me list for you the pros and cons here so you can decide for yourself.",5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"I am a college student and with the ongoing pandemic, I figured I would splurge a little and treat myself to good quality earbuds. Colleges praised the mic on the original galaxy buds and friends sounded crystal clear over calls with these buds. I received my pair and absolutely loved them for about a week. They work miraculously paired to my Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy Wearable app makes these buds sound extremely nice. Everything works smoothly when connected to my phone, however when I connect to my Surface Pro 7, these buds have a serious audio lag. I tried for hours to mess with my audio settings to make sure it was not my device but nothing seems to fix the issue. This makes it extremely problematic and almost impossible to participate in meetings and online lectures. People can hear me fine but my audio cuts out constantly. The same happens with listen to music and videos and is extremely annoying for having spent so much dough. I shot my shot and concluded they great for commutes and leisure but not fantastic for classwork. Again they work fine paired to a phone, but they are trash when paired to laptop devices.",3,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"First pair i bought were defective but i was able to return them for a refund.  No issue. Bought another pair and they work beautifully. Great sound quality and i love all the features it has to interact with my Note 10+Was worried they wouldn't fit in my ears since I've always stayed away from buds because they usually just fall out of my ear. But these fit perfectly. I can dance, workout, ride my nit, etc. With these and they dont budge.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,1,0
"I did lots of research and decided to go with these instead of the AirPods. For 5 months, they were great...no complaints except the touch commands aren‚Äôt very responsive. One day at work, I took the left bud out so I could better hear coworkers if they needed me. The next day, the left bud wouldn‚Äôt connect to the case or charge. I have tried all of the suggestions from Samsung to no avail. Apparently it‚Äôs a common problem and they make it very difficult to utilize their one year warranty. I‚Äôm waiting to hear from them after messaging them, but I don‚Äôt plan on wasting hours and hours of time like other people have reported doing. I just won‚Äôt purchase anything from Samsung again. I did like them when they worked, tho, so it‚Äôs a shame.Edit* On 9/26 I received my repaired earbuds in the mail! It did take a handful of back-and-forth messages, 4-5, and 3 weeks, but they paid for shipping UPS and the repair was free. Interestingly enough, after I wrote this initial review, I went ahead and ordered the AirPods Pro and after receiving my galaxy buds+ back yesterday, I processed the return of my AirPods. They are just not as comfy as the buds and way too expensive to hurt my ears! I just hope the repair lasts on these!",4,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
"When it comes to wireless earbuds I more sound and features kind of guy. If the earbuds have good features but do not sound good I will not buy them. If they have good sound and ok features I may consider them, but when it comes to the Samsung buds plus they are really worth it sound is amazing and love the touch feature and especially the feature that allows ambient noise so you can hear the outside while wearing your buds. If i had to compare these buds between the Bose soundSport wireless earbuds for 200 these Samsung buds plus do not compare anything to the Bose soundSport. If you are looking for earbuds and you are looking at Bose because its a well known brand, save your self the time and get the Samsung buds plus for 148 instead of spending 200 and you get more features that the Bose SoundSport does not have and the sound is louder to and sounds better. Now with the Samsung buds plus you may not get the good thumping you want like you do with the Bose but you can change the equalizer to one of the presets to your liking. To make a long story short, These are the best wireless  buds i have ever owned. It is not about the price that makes the buds better. its about the brand and quality and how they sound. I am surprised to say that a 148 pair of earbuds are better then a 200 dollar buds. You would think the high dollar ones are better but that is not always the case. You never know til you try the product out. I have hear reviews that say the sound is not wow taking and i have heard reviews that these are fantastic buds and I'm going to agree with the fantastic buds. Sorry to all for making a long review but the more detail the better the review and the more it helps others understand the awesomeness in these Samsung buds plus.",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"Great headphones I'm really impressed I switched from airpods pro. Comparing them biggest things I noticed was buds had more bass without a doubt but airpods pro got louder.  However the volume was my only complaint especially without noise cancelation...however I did find an app for Android called ""volume booster"" that makes these painfully loud (200% boost). Personally I think they are more comfortable than airpods and feel more secure. Just to summarize since I got these and the volume booster I haven't picked up my airpods 1 time",5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"I work in a loud area, and these really drowned out the noise so I can hear the music loud and clear. Plus the battery life is insane. Used them for a little over 9hrs and they still had juice! Lastly, they stay in place. I put them on and violently shook my head. They stay like magic! Also the Galaxy Wearables app makes them even better!!",5,1,2020-9-17,1,1,1
"The battery life, audio quality and compatibility with my note 9 is wonderful. They connect super fast, the ambient sound feature works great.My problem lies with these things constantly loosening and falling from my ears.

"AMAZING product. I've gotten fed up of trying to find quality products. Everything has a caveat these days - battery life, bluetooth connectivity, buggy noise canceling, etc.These products just work. I take them out of the case and they pair to my phone before they're in my ears. I take them out of the case and they pair to my laptop (Windows 10) before they're in my ears (unless they were previously paired to my phone, in which case I need to manually pair them via bluetooth settings on the laptop).",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"The battery life alone sold this for me as I usually listen to music during work. It'll last my whole shift, a jog after work, and some audiobook time at night with still over 50% charge on the case.The sound quality isn't the greatest compared to some higher end earbuds or headphones, it does deliver clear sound with good highs and decent bass. It may not be for some audiophile purists, but for most it will do just fine.",5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"I spent hours reviewing options, these got such high reviews, and seemed the right match for my Samsung Galaxy S9+. I'm completely disappointed. I mostly use them for walking. Facing upwind (in a breezy area) they catch the breeze and get wind noise interference. And I get ""dropouts"" even while holding my phone in my hand, no matter the app being used. I spend a lot of time walking in an isolated locale during this pandemic and this is just one more disappointment to add to everything else (fully aware, a small thing compared to what could be). I only bought these because my over-the-neck earphones finally gave up. They did not have great sound, but worked just fine. This rather pricey ""upgrade"" is a complete failure.",1,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"These things have adequate sound for listening to podcasts and music. The equalizer is pretty much non-existent. None of the settings make much difference. The received sound during telephone calls is marginal, the transmitted sound is an unintelligible staticky mess. No one can understand anything I say. If I wasn‚Äôt passed the return date, I‚Äôd send them back. Fail on the telephone use, adequate on the rest.",2,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
"Excellent battery life, lasts all day at work and then some. Sound quality is great, but not mind blowing. Bass could be a little better. Doesn't have Active Noise Canceling, but you don't need it since these seal in your ears. Ambient sound is a life saver at work when you need to hear what's going on around you. I really like the touch controls, very customizable, and the volume up and down controls are a nice upgrade from the original Galaxy Buds. Call quality is crystal clear, even when I'm 10 or 15 feet away from my phone. Buy them, you won't be disappointed.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"Prior to taking the jump into ""expensive"" wireless earbuds, I used to use those taotronics earbuds, which lasted me a full year before running into any battery/connection issues. Thinking I could get my money's worth in a more expensive product, I bought these.The sound quality was awesome, and a huge upgrade, and the fit was awesome when I was running/ working out. The seal is also great, even without ANC these do a great job of blocking out noise. (To the point where I can't tell a big difference between these and my ANC headphones when it comes to everyday use; I'm sure in planes or in loud places there's a difference.)",2,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"These are wonderful. They sound amazing and fit me very well. There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said better by someone else.-HOWEVER- If you ride a motorcycle. And, if like me, you are concerned about your earbuds being pulled out while pulling your helmet on and off? I can tell you that in my experience they have always stayed put perfectly while putting my helmet on. Taking my helmet off does pull them loose, but not all the way out. And for that, I couldn't be happier to finally have good quality music on my rides where I can still hear traffic and my engine. Even if I have to push them in a little bit after I get off the bike.",5,1,2020-4-29,1,1,0
"I bought these hoping that some people were over-exaggerating about these headphone's flaws. I was looking for a non-Apple/reasonably priced pair of wireless headphones for phone calls and exercise. These are good for neither. They are only just barely compatible with iphone, and one side frequently doesn't connect. I have to reset the bluetooth connection about every other time I use them. The ambient sound feature isn't a good thing. It just increases the volume of things happening outside of your headphones. Trying to jog with these was a joke. The sound of wind flying between my ear and the headphones was so loud I could not hear my music. It was only audible while walking. These also have about four different touch ""buttons"" on the sides. So if you need to adjust them in your ears, you're bound to pause your music, hang up your phone call, or blast the volume on accident. Total waste of money.",2,1,2020-7-10,1,1,0
"First of all it's a Samsung. You can't go wrong with any of their products.Sound is amazing!! Especially when it's on the dynamic mode. With dual drivers in each earbud, everything is crisp and clear. The biggest seller for me was the ambient sound mode. With this you can listen to music and still hear people around you . This works well especially if you're at work. They have a low, medium and high setting just in case it's too much. And today.....as I got out of the car to walk towards my house I accidentally dropped one of the earbuds, that was laying in my lap in the car, on the ground when I got out.  Of course I panicked thinking I'd never find it and probably misplaced it at work thinking it's lost for good now. Then  I remembered that on the Galaxy wearable app there's a way to find a lost earbud by tapping find my earbud. When you tap it and if it's close by, you'll  hear a loud chirping sound. Thankfully I found it on my front lawn. If it wasn't for that feature I would have been SOL big time. Another big reason I'm satisfied with this product.  üëçüòÅüòé",5,1,2020-3-10,1,1,0
"These things don't sound very good to me, in fact they sound just as bad as the gen 1 version which my wife has. When I compare them to the standard corded AKG buds that came with my Galaxy S9 there's absolutely no comparison. The corded phones have more clear bass, smoother presence, less fatiguing highs. You know, like real headphones. The upgraded sound was the main selling point and why I decided to spend the extra money on these but I'm disappointed. I'm sticking with my corded phones for music listening while these are just for meetings and phone calls.",3,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0
"i was originally going to purchase the IPHONE air pods, even though I have an android phone.  But all the features won't work with an android phone,  so I decided to buy these and love them very good quality. Love the charging case. Charge on these ear pods last about 9 hours of talking time. Not straight talking time but like calls off and on all day. Which is good. Glad I got these.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,1,0
I'm a cheapy when it comes to headphones. I purchased the raycon 55 which were serviceable but terrible bass. Then I got some knock off brand $30 cheap plastic actually decent sound but failed every where else. Did not want air pods because I just think they look silly with the book. And I was going to go with the original air buds but for $50 more it seem to make sense. What I can say these sound amazing! Balanced sound and bass great clarity. I wish call volumes little louder buts a knit pick. I purchased these actually because working from home amid covid I needed good teleconference ear buds. But now we use zoom so I use them to hear and cancel out background noises. When music is on they basically are noise cancelling. I have Samsung level over the ear blue tooth headphones as well and will put those against Bose. Great product!,5,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0
"Disclaimer: I've had these for about a week nowAlright, let's start with the negatives first since there really aren't that many. First off, the ambient sound feature is cool, definitely something that previous wireless earbuds didn't have, but it's a bit weak in my opinion. I have to turn my music way down in order to listen to someone who's trying to talk to me from about 3 feet away. Second, the sound quality is great, but you kinda have to shove the buds deep into your ear to hear the bass clearly, which starts hurting the outside of your ears after 30 mins or so (it might just be because my ears are small but who knows). Thirdly, the touch system on the earbuds' pads are VERY sensitive. I could be combing my hair and if I accidentally touch the bud at all during a stroke of the brush, my music will pause.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"I'll keep it simple. Worth the money.I ordered three. Only one came with a small issue. It would sometimes disconnect from one side, randomly. Unusually but it happened, figured I would mention it. I returned it.",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"I absolutely love so much about these! Where do I start? The battery legit lasts about 11 hours. The sound has great quality. I prefer the bass booster setting. I love how the app allows you to modify the settings. When I first heard of ambient sound I didn't think I'd like it because it sounded weird. However, after using it, I love it! Being able to hear my surroundings without compromising the volume of the music is an incredible feature. The functions make it easy to switch ambient sound on and off. Lastly, even though they aren't noise cancelling, they block out nearly all sound. This is crazy because I only use about 50% volume. I highly recommend these!",5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
These are my first wireless earbuds so I don't really have much to compare to. I investigated a few pairs but decided  I wanted a a good pair w/o the huge price tag and features I would never use.So far these are working very well with phone calls and listening. The ambient sound controls are very useful when at work or transit as they allow peripheral noises that allow you to be aware of surroundings. Overall I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend these. I am glad I waited for the upgrade as the 1st gen had complaints about call quality.,5,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
"Great when they worked, but left bud stopped working. It was charged, tried re-pairing, resetting earbuds. Tried letting the case and buds die completely, then fully recharge. Can't seem to get it to work. Left bud is completely grayed out in Wearable app, as if it isn't paired. Looked online and followed numerous guides, no dice. Short of taking them in, im at a loss of what else to do. Loved them while they worked, and ambiance feature is very nice for while I am at work and need to communicate, or even while I'm out and about. Sound quality is impressive for their size, and I found them to be very comfortable, and battery life is outstanding. Would recommend 100% if both buds worked no issue.",2,1,2020-8-9,1,1,0
"These are great on battery life and have the same basic functions as the 1st buds, but the touch response is awful.  They are slow to pause or they don't respond at all. They also don't catch all of the taps each time. Also, don't get the white ones, I've had these for about a month and they are already dingy.",3,1,2020-8-25,1,1,0

"I got these because I was unable to find a pair of comfortable Bluetooth headphones. I intended to use them for Zoom calls. Audio quality is fine, but it's a coin toss if people can hear me, and if they can, another coin toss if they can hear me *well*. Part of the problem is the touchpads on the buds which affect volume/muting etc... which are difficult to avoid when inserting. They are somewhat comfortable. I find myself switching back to my uncomfortable headphones frequently.",2,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0

"I got this for work, primary purpose was for Zoom calls and phone calls. It would frequently disconnect and send my laptop into a haywire situation, where it would completely shutdown all sound from the laptop, headset, headphones, other devices etc. and I needed to restart my computer.I also got this in order to play games with friends over Discord and Zoom calls, but it had a terrible connection. My friends voices were frequently distorted and laggy, but worst of all was my voice had about a 3 second lag time and it was incredibly annoying. I'm connected to Zoom/Discord over bluetooth obviously using my Samsung A50.",1,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"Sound quality is rather okay-ish, even with the app's equalizer. Reminds me of those early '90s dollar store headphone days quality. Figured the brand name would be better than those in the under $50 category but not too sure. Finish is great, & comes with enough sizing parts to fit many ear types. Will find more out about battery life after extended use but lasted for quite a while depending on use. Microphones work fine & no issues with calls. These are not noise cancelling, but will block most noises if you're willing to damage your eardrums by cranking up the music.",4,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"I bought this to compare it with the google pixel bud2. Overall I would say that this is an AMAZING set of earphones. I am NO audiophile, but trust me when I tell you that you will be amazed with the sound quality.

"My journey to falling love with the Buds+ took three less-than-stellar experiences with other models.  First was the Boltune Bluetooth V5.1.  Music quality was good.  Call quality was poor.  They wouldn‚Äôt stay in my ears and operation of the buds was not intuitive.  Next was the Jabra Elite Active 75t.  I expected so much more for the price they charge.  Fit was not comfortable or secure.  People I called had a difficult time hearing me.  Next up were the AirPods.  They were good quality and decent fit.  Battery life was relatively short and I didn‚Äôt like that they require a third party app for just partial integration with Android.With some trepidation from my poor experiences, I bought the Buds+.  I think they are perfect!  Super comfortable and secure in my ears.  Call quality is great on both ends.  Music is a pleasure.  Battery life is terrific.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
I love them more than any other ear buds that I've owned but they arent  Water resistant at all supposedly and mine only last around 8-9 hours but they are still amazing and last longer than any others out there plus they sound amazing and you cant even feel them in your ears hardly even after 9 hours straight I love them and that's why I love everything Samsung lol,4,1,2020-3-4,1,1,0
"I tried many brands and types of headsets and  this one is one of the best. Battery life is awesome 11-12 hours of listening, sound is great controls are nice I like that you have to tap twice to pick or hang up the call (no accidental hanging up while correcting fit) Only down side is a range definitely a lot shorter then other sets I used but I will trade that for 12h of battery life",4,1,2020-6-13,1,1,0

"I had gone through a lot of earbuds for my workouts and I can say that in terms of comfort, range, and the ability to stay in your ears in quick motions workouts. These earbuds stand the test of time. Awesome ambient mode and multiple touch options to play, skip, pause, and replay. With the battery in the case, these buds have the longevity to last for the entire day of listening and then some. No active noise cancelling but with how they fit, you can barely hear anything around you without ambient mode turned on. Bass is a little lacking but for the price its a bargain compromise compared to the air-pods pro being twice the cost.",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"These work we'll while I'm in the office working (not moving around much), but the moment I go outside to jog or any physical activity they start cutting out. Another issue I had with the first pair was the touch pad on the ear bud started flaking off (these were returned).",1,1,2020-4-5,1,2,0
"Sound is pretty good. It's very clear, but could benefit from increased bass response. It seemed flat at first, but changed the EQ setting to Dynamic in the Galaxy Wearable app which greatly improved the sound. The others EQ settings are terrible. Ambient sound works well enough, but don't expect it to sound you're not wearing the buds. While sounds do come through very well, it's very tinny and artificial sounding. The passive noise cancellation works as well as one might expect, but it dependent on getting a good seal. 3 sets of tips and 2 sets of wings are provided, so you should be able to find a combo that works well for most ears.",4,1,2020-8-17,1,1,0
"Well that was disappointing. Decided to get wireless in ear this time and the leftnone would not function at all.

"I bought these on impulse after I washed my last pair of bluetooth headphones at work. The last pair were a $40 pair and the price difference shows. The Buds+ are extremely comfortable. I didnt realize they have an option for ambient noise which is perfect for work. Now I can wear both buds but not miss important information going on around me. Call quality is great. Sound for music and movies is great. The touch sensors are a *little* too sensitive for me. If I roll over in bed with them on, my pillow can pause my show. You can lock the touch pad sensors in the app. I wish there was a way to dull the sensitivity like on a cell phone screen. I also wish I didnt have to go out of the way to purchase a case for the case. It feels fragile and it's so small I could lose it. I decided to buy a case with a carabiners clip so that way I can clip it to a bag or my jeans. Overall extremely satisfied. I definitely wont be washing this pair.",5,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"I normally don't write reviews however when a product works well we have to tell others.  I have a Samsung s8 (soon upgrading to the s20 ultra). I also own Samsung gear s3 smart watch and a few Samsung televisions. The Galaxy Buds+ synced up really with my phone.  They have this feature called Ambient sound.  It works extremely well if you work in a environment were you have to be aware of surrounding,  however if the volume of your media is too high you won't be able to understand a person talking next to you. I personally love this because I can listen to music while I also interact with the outside world all without taking my headphones off.  They are small and light weight.  My dreadlocks covers mines, so people often don't notice I'm wearing them.  I love that they charge wirelessly in case. The case is a bit small for my liking and also very smooth. The equalizer controls are in the galaxy wearable app, and are comparable to their labeling.  I prefer to be able to control my equalizer level in all ranges. The controls are a simple series of taps and a tap and hold command. The tap and hold commands can be changed from either voice command, spotify, Ambient sound, volume up, volume down for either right or left ear bud. One thing to be aware of is that if choose to use tap and hold as volume control the other earbud will automatically set other earbud as well. I love that if miss place a earbud I can make it alert. Music and media sound quality is great. The call quality is wonderful when coupled with the ambient sound because your able to hear yourself and the person your talking to clearly. The only thing about these earbuds that I don't like is that if you use the ambient sound feature you have to be careful not to cover the bottom mic otherwise causes feedback loop.",5,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0

"The new virsion earbuds are the best pair I used, they have fast and perfect connection between single or both earbuds and devices. The sound is pretty good except when I played Red Alert 3.  Compaired with music and background sounds in video, the human voice is relatively weak. Meanwhile, sometime the sound seems a little bit wired.(I dont know whether it is issue of stream source or defect of buds) . All in all, currently sumsung +buds seem like the best choice, compared with other TWS products, such as airpod, sennheiser momentum, powerbeats, hammerhead.",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
These are by far the best pair of headphones I've ever owned. The sound quality is amazing and calls are crystal clear. The ambient sound is a plus when you're out and about and need to be aware of what's going on around you while listening to music or whatever. They pair immediately when I open them with my galaxy s9 and the battery life is exceptional I work an 8 hour day and when I get off they're still at 35%.

Not an issue with these babies. I even had someone in public notice them and ask what brand they were. That's never happened. I highly recommend these.

"Wow.. Nothing but GOOD. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and I wanted something to pair well with my phone. At first I did my research on skull candy, bose, and beats. None of the reviews won up to these buds. I read nothing but good about the regular buds and these buds+. all I can say is I am satisfied and in LOVE with the buds+. The connection and sync is on point. As soon as I opened them they connected to my phone right away! No hassle, easy set up with the Wear App already in my phone.SET UP ‚Ä¢Satisfied with the different TouchPad settings, the Equalizer choices and especially the Ambient Sound settings! The Ambient sound setting is what sold me, its so crisp and clear when set up to the users preference. Or you can just easily turn it off to enjoy the awesome noise cancelation! You won't be disappointed.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,1

I'm on the phone 4-8 hours per day for work. My airpods were a few years old and would hardly make it though an hour long call. I was looking for the best battery life in replacement headset. I'm totally impressed. I popped these in at 9am and took them out at 5pm. Had about 5 hours of call time and they were still at over 50% battery capacity!The sound quality is fine- nothing amazing but nothing bad. It took a bit to figure out the fit but once I got it they don't fall out.,5,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0

"I recieved my galaxy buds+ cloud blue today. I ain't expected crazy sounding ear buds. But once I paired them to do a sound test I was blown away, the bass was strong along with the treble and mids was like wise. They sound like the over ear AKG headphones. I have B&O E8 ear buds and I swear the galaxy buds plus blow them out the water far as sound quality and call quality,  along with battery life. But be mindful I have a galaxy Note 10 plus phone. So with the Dolby Atmos on really push these ear buds over the top. I'm being honest, these Galaxy buds+ is the best ear buds on the market. I ain't expected this from $150 ear buds. I paid $300 for my B&O E8 and they dont compare. If a person say galaxy buds ain't loud with strong bass and bright Treble. Then they need to order ear wax cleaner.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,1,0
"I was surprised that these ear buds sounded so horrible when listening to music considering the generally positive reviews and the overall rating. I found these work great for phone calls, I love the form factor and how they fit in my ears, and the tap interface was intuitive and responsive. However I was extremely disappointed by their sound quality when listening to music--at first. The ear buds are tinny, with barely any bass response. Vocals sounds like they are coming through a tin can. Despite messing with the equalizer in the app and on my iPhone I couldn't get them to sound good at all compared to my older AirPods. However, after doing some research online I found that the ear tips and wings that you use can make a difference. I thought the mediums were a good fit, but I went up in size to the large and what a difference in the music! Be sure to try all the ear tips and wings before deciding if you like or don't like these ear buds, because they made a huge difference in the quality of the sounds after I found the proper fit.",4,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0

Initially bought for perceived quality and expected sound experience and was severely let down by sound quality with a complete lack of quality bass and treble! They fit and feel high quality and the case is beautiful but after adjusting the settings for hours I was disheartened to learn it was as good as it got which wasn't very good for $149! They do not sound as well sorted as even the wired speakers that come with the phone. I plan on returning after 1 week of ownership,2,1,2020-4-4,1,1,0
"These earbuds have changed the game! They paired with my phone and the Samsung Wear app with no issues. The sound is crisp and clear and with super high ambient mode you can enjoy your music and still be aware of your surroundings. The touchpads are customizable and yes you can pair with 2 different devices...simply open the Samsung Wear app on the device you want to pair with and just like that they are in sync with it. The battery life is second to none. I listened to music for 6 to 7 hours and they still had 20% left. I really can't picture paying $100 more for Airpods and them being worth doing so.

"These are great, sound quality, fit and battery life all great. However I just want 3 things to do better, the magnets that keep the earbuds in the case, x2 rating and these weird air bubbles I just found. I dropped the case once and the earbuds just flew out, luckily I got the red ones so they weren't hard to find, but I just wish they were stronger. With the x2 rating I would just like it to be x4 so that I'll have more confidence about getting them wet. Just a few hours ago I saw that there were some sort of air bubbles on both buds, turns out there like a ""wear and tear"" thing, but I've only had these for a week! But that's it everything else is great. Also I had this battery issue that the right drained faster but I just did a simple rest in the app and everything was fine.

"I was on the fence for a long time on buying wireless earbuds. Recently I got a job in which I can wear buds so I figured now I have a actual reason to buy some. After doing some research I decided on these to go with my galaxy. After receiving them and using them for a full work day I have to say I wish I bought them earlier. I like everything about them the fit, the color, the case, and there ability to make 8-10 hour workdays go fast. If I had to say anything negative would be that the sound quality for music isn't you know mind-blowing but for wireless tech that's to be expected.  It's in no way bad but for people who really can pick up on that stuff you may be disappointed. All in all great product.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0

"I had the original galaxy buds and loved them so much. However, sometimes the audio would blip and it annoyed me since they were expensive, so I returned them. I had to try these out and they are perfect. They're a little big but still look sleek. I love the blue color. The number of available controls are great. Tip: turn on the beta control ""double tap edge to change volume"" and then you have everything: open spotify, next song, previous song, pause/play, ambient sound (or voice assistant), and volume control - all from just touch. Battery life has lived up to its claims so far.",5,1,2020-5-10,1,1,0

The max volume was very low, but at least it was even.",2,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
"I finally decided to get some good earbuds and these are impressive! Sound quality is top notch. Battery life is ridiculously long. I could have them on all day (I use one at a time). I have a Samsung phone so there's an app that I can use with the earbuds that let me change the sound with an EQ, it tells me how much battery life I have for each earbud and the charging case.

"First off, I'm returning these because there's some sort of incompatibility between the buds' touch controls and the latest Spotify on Android 11.  I like these buds a lot, but I'm not migrating my entire Spotify library to another service to use them.With the right insert the buds block out noise really well, and the Ambient sound mode lets you let noise in if you want to.  Gestures are responsive and intuitive.  Pairing between different devices was pretty seamless.  Sound quality, provided you use the companion app to use the Dynamic equalizer setting, is also really good.  The buds stay pretty secure in the ears and are relatively comfortable for buds that go in the ear canal (I usually prefer around-ear headphones).",5,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0
These Bluetooth earbuds are super exceptional. They are great if you want to set your phone down and walk around and talk while hands free.  However if I'm planning on sitting still for a while and watching my tablet on being on my phone for a while I find I tend to grab my corded earbuds first because all I have to do is plug the cord in my device and listen ( no checking the Bluetooth connection). But that's probably just me because I'm an elderly person who is not used to all this new technology.

My favorite thing about the buds is probably the ergonomics. It fits in my ear perfectly and It feels like nothing is there.

These earbuds allow you to use one bud independently of the other. Other products don't allow the left bud to be used without the right being activated.There is an interface for settings you can access via phone.

"Based on all the great reviews, I thought these would be a great value.  Unfortunately, the multiple microphones seemed to do the opposite of what what intended--instead of reducing the background noise transmitted during a phone call, they amplified everything.  The party I was calling said it was easier/clearer to hear what was happening in the background than my own voice.  This seems to be a recurring complaint on various forums--I tried the normal fixes (reset the earbuds, download the newest update, etc).  Nothing worked, and these were returned to Amazon the very next day.",1,1,2020-10-5,1,0,0
"I've been using the Buds + for almost a week and at least 6 hours each day. They are light and fit snugly and comfortably in my ears and will not fall out. The sound is great and so is the feature set. Haven't completely drained the battery yet so can't speak to the 11 hour claim but they still have at least 40% charge when I put them back in the case. I'm very impressed with them. In the ""Labs"" folder of the wearable app, try the ""Double tap earbud edge"" for volumn control, but don't tap the Buds, instead just double tap the back of the left ear to lower the volumn and the right ear to raise the volumn. The ambient feature works great. I just pause the music when I'm talking with someone and the outside mic let's me clearly hear the conversation.

This new version of Galaxy Buds are so much better than the last ones. The wings help them fit better this time and really help with noise cancellation. When talking on the phone my voice is all people can here now (the last version made people hear EVERYTHING around me) and I can barely here what's going on around me. The ambient sound feature (to let in the noise around me) is a lot better too. The battery life is almost double of the last version and they seem to also charge faster as well.

They sound great, there is no stuttering or cutting in and out, and they remain connected the whole time I use them. I like the charging case. The battery life on these buds is completely adequate.

The pair I got was (I'm hoping) defective where if I left the buds out of the case for more than 2-3 minutes they would unsynchronize from each other and the only sound I'd hear are high pitched glitches. The only options to fix that would be to reset the buds through the Galaxy Wearable app or put them back in the case for a couple of minutes. I highly doubt the developers would force the users to constantly be wary of whether their buds are either charging or in use at all times.EDIT: the new pair had similar issues, Soni was hoping it was just some specific software glitch. After a couple of updates, it seems to be working a lot better. The ambience mode tends to force the buds to de-sync once in a while, so I just have it off at all times.

"The right ear bud starts to muffle and starts to lower in sound over time.

I tried every possible trouble shooting method there is and none made it work so off it goes back to amazon for another 2-3 weeks.,1,1,2020-5-21,1,2,1
"These are amazing headphones! I've been sceptical of wireless earbuds, and tried a few that did NOT do what they'd promised as far as quality of the call for people on the other line. I'm a soft spoken guy, and sounding like I was in the other room was unhelpful. Especially with hard of hearing folks in my family.After my second refund, Amazon gave me a deal on these, and I decided to give wireless earbuds one last try. I'm glad I did. Not only is the call quality better than my phone's microphone, but the audio quality on my end is spectacular. I love the ambient sundfeature that allows you to listen to music, and hear yourself (or others) voice come through the buds. The galaxy wear app really makes these worth the price. The ONLY issue I've had so far is how small the tether length is, but I'll rarely be away from my phone when using them, anyway.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
Hasta ahora estoy muy contenta me gusta mucho como se escucha la verdad no me molestan y la bater√≠a dura much√≠simo.  Solo hay algo que no me gusta cuando trato de ajustar el sonido para escuchar bien afuera o sea que no me bloquee completamente el sonido de afuera pues se escucha mal hace un ruido extra√±o.  Pero bueno nada es perfecto. La distancia es bastante buena yi he estado afuera en el patio y el tel√©fono dentro de la casa y no me afecta el sonido puesto estar escuchando m√∫sica y puedo responder las llamadas sin mucho problema.,4,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"My little brother wanted earbuds for his birthday, and because I had the original Galaxy Buds, I decided to buy him the Galaxy Buds+. Honestly, BEST choice ever, he loves it so much, and I'm jealous because I didn't buy one for myself. The original one lasted 6 hrs, which is already long, but now it lasts for 11 hrs....That's INSANE, for anyone that is looking for earbuds, this will give you the bang for your buck!",5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"Just like other customer, bought these 3 months ago, 2.5 months in the left bud stopped working. Apparently its an issue across the board with a ton of these devices from the thousands of people with the same issue on a ton of different forums online. I also called Samsung, they verified they've seen the issue a lot recently but assured me NOT TO WORRY because im still well within my warranty. I sent in the buds next day to get fixed, 2 weeks later was also told that I bought internationally and that they can't honor the warranty and ill have to take it up with Amazon. It clearly states that this purchase was made from Samsung official on Amazon and it clearly states in the description that it is the US VERSION. Complete bs, total runaround and after numerous back and forth with Amazon not taking any responsibility, a supervisor that finally heard me gave me refund. My time and frustration not worth it. Will probably not be buying electronics anymore.",1,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0
"I would give it 4 or 5 stars if the software side of it wasn't so bad. Occasionally they'll just randomly pause the song, one bud will get stuck being substantially louder than the other. On the highest volume one will be sceaming in your ear and you can't even hear if the other is working. The only way to fix it is to reset them which they have to be at 30% for. Noise canceling is far from great but the ambient sound works well. If I could go back I would have bought a 50 dollar off brand pair rather than a 200 dollar pair that works well sometimesEdit: took it from 3 stars to 1 because it keeps happening. Now the right one is nearly inaudible and the left is normal. Restoring them to factory doesn't work. Turning ambient off doesn't work. Support is no help. Trying to get ahold of Samsung to return or replace is a nightmare. 0/10 would recommend. Save your money and buy 5 pairs of off brand ones, at least then you expect them to break within 90 days and you have 4 back ups!",1,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
Some reason getting extra noise like cracking noise when listening to music or on phone. When on phone have tons of static on them would need to switch to phone becuase of static. Battery last good but case does died within 4 to 5 hours. Contact company and was no help person was rude.,2,1,2020-3-28,1,1,0
Absolutely beautiful with amazing sound! Ambient sound and noise cancellation works very well! Bravo to Samsung for that. The only downside for me is that the Battery Life has not lived up to its promise of 11 hrs. Seems like approximately 6-8 hrs with light use and standby. Having the case with charge storage does re-charge very quickly within 15 minutes to make it through my day. Overall giving them 4 Stars.,4,1,2020-6-10,1,0,1
"The ""touch screen "" component is both cool and horrible at the same time as I find myself accidentally pressing it when adjusting the bud. I've hung up quite a few times on accident, almost everytime actually lol. The call quality is excellent both on my side and being able to be heard, seems like the buds pick up quite a lot of surrounding noises too, for example my husband can always hear the kids talk even from across the room. It can go a reasonable distance away from the phone. Charging is easy if you already own Samsung products, can be charged wirelessly too! Set up was a breeze because I already own galaxy products. If you wear these too much you will probably get an ear infection as of course it traps the... ahem ""ear mist"". BUT that's just what happens with buds in general.I think I'll be keeping these as I am only going to be wearing these for certain activities and for not for long hours at a time.",4,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"Do not trust that this seller is offering a ""US"" version.  I purchased this as a present, so it did not get used for a couple of months.  Then, upon the third use, one of the buds failed.  As these were still under warranty, I sent to Samsung. Samsung denied my warranty because it turns out these are the international version, and thus receive no warranty.  I rarely, if, ever comment on a product, but I was completely lied to by this company.  DO NOT PURCHASE.  Spend the extra $10 to get an official version from Samsung. It's well worth the cost to get a warranted item.",1,1,2020-9-1,1,1,0
"In love with these! So easy to use, so easy to connect with, so easy to charge, so easy to share listening with my husband on car rides/runs/bike rides (I wear one and he wears the other)! The galaxy wear app helps you control their noise level. You can choose through different settings depending on your preferences - for example you can have the ambient noise on/off :) these were 100% worth the money.",5,1,2020-6-3,1,0,1
"Charging port on box went bad in less than 2 months I can't charge the box to keep ear buds charged anymore, the touch pad on buds are terrible I have to tap repeatedly to get them to answer or hang up... too much hassle",1,1,2020-7-13,1,2,0
"Buying these headphones was not a decision that I took lightly.  after reviewing the pros and cons and watching several review videos on YouTube I decided to purchase these instead of buying the original Samsung Galaxy buds based on the improved call quality with extra microphones, better sound quality because of two different drivers in each earbud to handle dynamic and balanced sounds, and  better battery life.  Only had them for a week but great so far",4,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0
"On two occasions in four weeks of use, the left earbud put out a constant, high pitched sound during bluetooth pairing.  The sound persisted until I shut them down.  The first time, for a few uses afterward, the buds included a lot of fuzzy noise over the music.  I returned the Samsung buds because I didn't want an intermittent problem to happen again or get worse.  Other than that, I really liked them; great sound and fit, although controlling them with taps while in the ears is tricky, you have to get the location and angle of tap just right.",3,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"An unbelievable generational jump that isn't getting enough credit for how spectacular it is. The Buds+ are the purchase I've been waiting near a decade to make. Flawless connection, amazing sound quality, and all day battery. As a factory worker, these were a revolutionary jump in quality of life at work. Can not recommend highly enough!",5,1,2020-3-20,1,1,0
"Love these buds.  I'm not an audiophile.  I listen mostly to podcasts and audio books so the sound quality is great for me.  Music sounds crisp too.  They don't have active noise cancelling but they do seal out the outside world pretty well. Especially when the music is turned up.  The range is great.  I've never had a cut out.  I love that I can use either bud one at a time.  I switch back and forth and that gets me an almost unlimited play time.  After getting the right set up and about 30 minutes of getting used to the feel they are so comfortable I forget they are in.I've worn them hiking, jumping rope and all day and never had them come loose or fall out. Love them",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"Great product, but mine DID NOT arrive with rubber buds. I'm not sure if this was part of the deal? And the new ends I put on don't fit in the case, so I have to remove them every time so the connectors can reach. This is a huge disappointment, but the sound quality is excellent.",3,1,2020-8-18,1,1,0
"I was excited to get these earbuds in the mail, when they came they're so beautiful, i switch the ear thingie to a smaller size. I appreciate them but they still don't fit in my ear right, I'm afraid they'll pop out of my ear even when i press them in the canal. They're so sensitive to touch. They sound quality is low. I have the volume up in every device its linked to seems like i can hear a bit louder through my laptop than my cell phone. All in all I'm super disappointed in this product. I really wish the sound quailty was better and you can hear the music clearly instead of it sounding like you have a pillow between your ear and the ear bud. I truly bought this to listen to my music and i regret that i purcahsed them i should have got some nice bulky headphones instead. :(",2,1,2020-8-25,1,0,1
"These are good for work, have all the features, the app is great but it lacks good sound quality. I think most of the reviews in sound blogs and tech blogs are influenced and not genuine. Every review says it has great sound quality and great bass but that is just not true. I would recommend them for work but not for listening to music.Disappointed and returned. AKG needs to do a better job",3,1,2020-7-30,1,1,0
"The sound is amazing, it has deep bass and sharp treble for a great sound The equalizer built into Samsung wearables is really nice, the mic is very clear sounding. The battery is really nice too, after listening to music for an afternoon, the battery hardly budge. I most enjoy they are concealed in the ear and doesn't have the weird phantom look the airpods have. I highly recommend these.",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
"Absolutely love these.  I'm amazed by the battery life, the ambient sound feature, and the sound quality.  I recommend getting these to anyone. They fit perfectly in my ears but come with 3 different size buds and ear pieces for all different sizes. I even tried to make them fall out but couldn't.  And with the ambient sound feature you can just go outside and listen to nature and all the sounds around you crystal clear like having sharing aids.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"I love everything about these buds. They have excellent battery length, button programming, and sound quality. My only issue is sometimes it acts weird when I put my phone in my back pocket or put something between the phone and headset. Like connection is interrupted. This is extremely weird as bluetooth speakers or other bluetooth items never has this issue but these headphones do.",4,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
I really enjoy this product. I've used it both on my Galaxy s20 ultra and my iPhone 6. I wouldn't recommend this product to iPhone users as the experience on iPhone isn't as good with these. However if you have a Samsung phone these are a great option! The battery life is amazing. I also find the ambient sound mode very useful.  If I could make changes I would add ANC and a higher water resistance. If you're looking to save a little money and sacrifice a longer battery i would recommend the regular Galaxy Buds as they are not super different. Also do keep in mind these dont connect to anything else really besides phones and tablets! So if you're looking for headphones to use for computer these are not going to work! But they are perfect for my purposes and the isolating sound design is good enough to block out a lot of sounds.,5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
I got these for my boyfriend as he is a galaxy user and I got myself AirPods because I love my apple products! I will be returning my AirPods in exchange for these as the music quality is better and the ear phones are more comfortable in your ear! In fact mine get here today and I am stoked!,5,1,2020-3-4,1,1,0
"I had the original buds, they were great. But they started to develop connectivity issues over time. Upgraded to buds+, very happy. The sound quality is amazing, battery life is outstanding, and no more connection problems!  Love the blue color. The software updates are great too. You can name the device now, and have more control with sound quality and ambient noise. Love 'em.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"These earbuds work great with my Galaxy s10. The sound quality is great and music/videos come through very clearly. With the Galaxy Wearables app you can adjust the equalizer to choose many different sound enhancing options and you can choose if you'd like ambient sound (also what level of sound you'd like to hear)! The ambient sound really helps on phone calls and to hear what is going on around you if you wear your earbuds in public. The noise cancelling is really great, as well. They are super easy to keep track of despite being small and are very durable. Over all, they are great buy especially if you are a Samsung fan.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"I had the original Buds before this, and these are a noticeable improvement. With the originals, I had to always turn on the Ambient Noise setting each time I put them on or removed the ear buds, but not with these. These also begin pairing by the time I open the case, so the buds are being placed in my ears they're already paired, and the Ambient Noise is already turned ON.Sound quality is awesome. The clarity is amazing, and the bass is amazing. I currently have them in Dynamic on the equalizer and it seems to be a great overall setting so as to not be overpowered in one aspect over another.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
Good sound. I only took off stars because they sound about the same as my 20 dollar sound peats. I prefer to use these at work because of the sound passthrough. I can listen to music and not tune out the world.,4,1,2020-8-8,1,1,0
Sound is louder from one side than the other and app/resets/research/fixes/rebootsdont work to balance it.  I am sick of working on these things!  The other set we bought has a different set of challenges.  I have gone back to using wired buds.,1,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0
"Really disappointed in these buds, especially considering the price.  They were great for the first 90-120 days, then started dropping the BT connection sporadically.  For the last 30 days they've basically been unusable.  Connection never stays for more than a few seconds after pairing with my iPhone or Peloton.  I've made sure all software updates on all devices are installed.  I've tried resetting the Samsung app an re-pairing to the phone several times.  Nothing works.  The buds are two worthless bricks at this point.  It's not an issue with the iPhone, as that pairs seamlessly with all of my other BT devices.Sound:  It was really good when it works.  I liked the setting that the app allowed and the ambient noise option.",1,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"Bought these and have tried using them off and on for a few months now.  Love the convenience, sound is good, took a bit to get used to having them in for a duration (I live on the phone) but found that as I talk they will loosen to the point of falling out and I would have readjust them and in doing so it would disconnect the call.  Finally had to resort to turning off my Bluetooth on the phone during the call, switching to the phone, adjusting the Bud and then turning Bluetooth back on after the readjustment to not lose calls.  Unacceptable and have to go another route. Disappointed and $150 down the drain.",2,1,2020-7-7,1,1,0
"The battery life is excellent, but the noise quality can sometimes be lacking...it sounds as though the sound is breaking up at times if you too far walk away from your phone or are listening in another room despite being only a few meters away.  The earbuds fit really nicely in my ears, though-ive had issues with other buds falling out and these stay in snugly and are very comfortable to wear. If Samsung just cleared up some of the feedback sounds when you walk away from your phone a bit, I would definitely give these 5 stars down the line!",4,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
"Sound quality is not that good. I own the Sony WH-1000XM3 so I am spoiled. With this buds you can hear your surroundings even at max volume. I am getting the Sony Wf-1000XM3 instead. Don't get me wrong they are not bad, they just didn't meet my expectations. They are built well and they are comfy.",3,1,2020-7-14,1,2,0
I was a little skeptical to but these due to some so so ratings. I can only say that I am glad I did. I bought some cheap knock offs prior to this. The sound quality was tinny and the bluetooth connectivity was bad.Not these. The sound is rich and powerful and the connectivity is great.,5,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0
"I was hesitant to buy these, but other reviews and my tax return got the best of me... Long story short, I love them! I have a Samsung Galaxy A70 for a phone, and a windows 10 laptop, and these headphones work amazing with both. For everyday listening, they're great. I love the sound quality (bass is great, and there is a high dynamic range), and they are a joy to take phone calls with. I can hear the calls perfect, and those on the other end said my voice was very clear.I also work on a dusty, loud jobsite, and these are perfect. I run loud equipment, and these block the sound out amazingly, and if I ever have to talk to someone, I can just turn on the ambient sound feature and talk to those around me perfectly. Even using these all day (roughly 6 hours per day), I only have to charge these 2-3 times per week.",5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"These are easily the best wireless buds I've ever owned. The sound quality is really quite good. There is no active noise cancellation, but the buds make a great deal for me that is nearly just as good in my opinion. The tarbsoarency mode is good but not great, certainly functional but everything sounds a bit tinny.The real show stopper here though is the battery life. Yesterday, I wore both buds for over 8 hours and still had about a 20% charge left. Even if I ran that out though I have another 11 hour charge in the case! These buds are worth every penny of the price.",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"I'm not a fan of bass heavy music , so these are perfect for me , I can hear all instruments .. As for noise cancelation, don't buy them for that as it's not the best. It's not in Bose territory , you can still hear things like the AC in your home (not loud though)., but that's OK with me. So far , this the only bluetooth item that doesn't break up with my Galaxy S8. Perfect for phone calls .",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"There are little annoyances but overall they're very good. The ear tips are never the right size which leaves it either falling out or ear fatigue. The updates are a little iffy sometimes which can mean either amazing ambient sound or none depending on the update. However I love the crystal clear call quality. Flawlessly switches between devices and as soon as you pop them in, they're ready to go. Amazing battery life. Just pop em in the case for a few and they're good to go for another hour. Pocket sized case which makes it easy to travel with.",4,1,2020-9-10,1,0,1
"This is the first review I've ever written on Amazon. These earbuds are that good! The sound quality is phenomenal, and the CALL QUALITY is fantastic! Huge improvement over the previous echo buds. I bought these primarily to use for conference calls, and they do not disappoint. No one could even tell that I was using earbuds.The pass-through feature is great as well, and I love being able to adjust the amount of ambient noise coming in. Turning the feature up to high effectively gives you superhuman hearing which is pretty neat, but I generally keep that setting a bit lower.",5,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"The regular Galaxy Buds have a very bad call quality. I bought these from Amazon. They sent me regular Buds in a Buds Plus box. The only visible difference between the two is that the Buds Plus have two mics on each earpiece, and the case has buttons instead of an LED.  I might not have noticed it, but for the super bad call quality, which made me start hunting for a fix. So if you buy these, beware. Make sure the Buds in the box actually are the Plus Buds, and not the regular Buds in a Buds Plus box. I sent them back and just ordered them from Samsung's site.  I figured my odds of getting the real Buds Plus would be greater.",1,1,2020-5-16,1,1,0
Don't buy these just get the cheap pair at least that way your not wasting a bunch of money on junk. I have only used these once they worked great sounded great the next time I went to use them the right side didn't work. The app looked like it was saying the right side didn't charge. Don't waste your money on these don't say you were not warned.,1,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"I enjoyed these headphones for 4 months. One day the left bud wouldn't work. I tried everything the internet had to offer to fix it and it still wouldn't work. I spoke with samsungs help line and they said it would be covered by their 1 year warranty because these are the international version. They will fix it for $100 which is the price you can buy these new. I understand that I should've read the fine print and saw that the international buds weren't covered by warranty. Regardless, it's embarrassing that Samsung builds products that only last 4 months with regular use then won't back them up. I'm not an apple fan but I will be buying airpods and maybe even an iPhone going forward.",1,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"These are fantastic. I use them for everything, they connect to my TV via firestick, they connect to my echo show, and they of course connect to my phone. These are easily the best wireless headphones I've ever had. The battery life is great and I often forget to charge my case. Another great feature of these is the fact if your case is running low on charge and you have a Samsung note 10, you can charge the case via your phone.All in all I'm in love with these headphones.",5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
"My 1st pair of any kind of BT earbuds.  They are exactly as described by several YouT reviews.  The better you fit these into your ears, the better is the sound--which is amazing. They work exceptionally well on the phone. The only limitation at the moment, is inability to pair w/Win 10 Pro for PCs.  Hopefully MSFT and Samsung will iron this out, as the regular Buds have capability.",5,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0

The product came with a defect, there were electronic components rattling inside my buds+ case so I tried to contact the seller about receiving a new product without having to use up my protection plan since this was not my fault.

"These are amazing for so many reasons. The sound quality is great, the battery life is outstanding, and are a really good deal at this price. I work in a mostly noisy environment where I am required to communicate via a company radio, so being able to listen to music and still hear what I need to hear thanks to the ambient sound mics is perfect. It takes some getting used to ( sounds like you're talking into a microphone, but sounds are amplified if nothing is playing so thats nice).  With the latest update, you can boost the ambient sound even further, which is how I leave them set now. I was concerned at first about loud sounds being amplified as well, but it quietens as soon as something loud happens (alot like amplified shooting earmuffs). Another great Samsung product!",5,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"I was head banging to some music like a violent crackhead, and these little black beauties didn't budge an inch.

"Not made for music. If you enjoy listening to music in your ears, you are better off not goetting these. There is barely any mid, no base and 70 to 80% treble. There are setting in the app that allows you to control presets that work but sound like trash with music. Im sorry but it sucks lol. My $20 wired pair sounds better.On a good note, the connection quality to ohone is awesome. Great for talking and listening to audiobooks. Try them out. Return them for free.

"I had a pair of Jabra elites that IMO sounded a little nicer, but I had constant issues with them disconnecting randomly when I would walk a little bit away from my phone or get a call.These earbuds are solid. No disconnection issues ever, even in pouring rain. I don't think the battery can die in a single day. I wore them from when I woke up until I went to sleep and they're still going strong on day 2.",5,1,2020-4-4,1,1,0
"These earbuds are purposefully made for Samsung products. It so happens they worked well with my Google Pixel Phone. The sound is very crisp, on point. I like a lot of bass. For my liking, these earbuds don't make the cut, but the sound is so clear, I would have kept them. Call quality might just be the best in the business. The case feels flimsy. Most disappointing is, a Samsung Galaxy Support agent told me clearly they are not compatible with PCs. There is a clear lag between sound/image and sound in the earbuds. Very disappointed. I can't believe someone would pay so much to have earbuds work only (exclusively!) with one device.",2,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0

I have also tried the Jabra Elite 65T active, again was not disappointed.After purchasing these, I never realized how much I was missing out! Sound quality is absolutely amazing.  Clear, crisp,  with great bass.  Other online reviews felt battery life compared to competitors was not up to par. Who honestly needs 25 hrs of life on headphones?  Its easy to charge the case using wireless charging on my charging mat in room, my truck or even my phone",5,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
It is really awesome for us Samsung users! Everything connects easy.  The commands are easy to follow and the rubber booty on the buds are interchangeable and help them to not fall out.

I tried resetting them to factory settings, forgetting the connection on the bluetooth menu, the connection could not be found most times and then when it could be found it would connect only for a moment and then be dropped again. I found fixes online and none of them worked for me. I'm hoping they were just defective. I have sadly and reluctantly returned them and gotten airpod pros.",3,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
I will start off by saying there are better wireless buds for the money. However I am very happy with these. They look very nice and don't protrude from your ears like some others. The battery life is pretty good and more than enough to last me a few days before having to charge again. The sound quality isn't gonna blow you away but comparatively its decent and the ambient noise feature is nice to have. Lastly the fit of these takes a little bit to figure out whats comfortable but once you find it they stay in pretty well and if they weren't blasting noise in my ears I'd forget they're there.,5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"I love love love my galaxy earbuds!!!!!!!! The only thing I could say could be better is a bigger battery for the charging case. The sound is indeed rich and pure. I've never had sound like this! And they have features I didnt even know about. Granted I have read the manual much or researched them much either. So as I discover each feature I love them more and more. My favorite is when my notifications go off they announce what type of notification it is; email, text message, etc. I find that super helpful. As well as they fit wonderfully in my ears. No discomfort and very secure. I really like that the buds themselves sit just at the entrance of your ear canal, they dont go into the canal like most other earbuds. It feels better that way! I bought mine brand new and I say they are definitely worth the money. Thank you Samsung!!!",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,1
"I have owned the Galaxy buds for about a year now and really liked them, except for the call quality (pretty much unusable). I didn't see anything out that had the smooth connectivity (Note 10) and features as the buds and call quality, so I decided to tough it out until something came along that I liked. The Buds+ definitely take it to the next level. The sound quality is great, battery life is significantly improved, ambient sound is effective (but tinny), more controls at the buds themselves, and of course, great call quality. They literally took all the things I liked and improved them and fixed all the things I didn't like. 3 very MINOR complaints. They don't fit quite as well as the original buds, but still great. I hit pause or play on accident when removing them from my ears. The ambient noise is tinny. HIGHLY RECCOMEND!",5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"I was deciding between these, the hd599 and the wh1000xm3. I might still get one or both of those later, but I decided to start with these. These not only have the best audio quality I have ever tried, but they also have many usability features that make them an incredible value. You can use 1 headphone while the other is charging and they have about 10hrs of battery. They also pair and unpair very quickly and of course have no wire. For audio quality they are almost perfectly flat in amplifier transfer function frequency response it is actually like a flat line, I suggest you look at the rtings review. This is perfect for classical music with a lot of mids and highs that is often done misjustice by bass heavy headphones",5,1,2020-9-29,1,0,0
"The galaxy buds plus are great and everything as Samsung Promised. They charge fast, they sound amazing, they look beautiful, and have all these amazing features like ambient mode, tracking, great battery life, etc. Only thing I'm upset with is Amazon. They were estimated 2 week delivery on Prime but they didn't even show up. They came 5 days late. That's nearly 3 weeks where as Samsung could've delivered them in 4 days. Im very upset and disappointed.  Great product but never buying anything important like electronics from Amazon ever again. Don't waste your time ordering from Amazon when it comes to Samsung products, just go directly to Samsung where you can get fast free shipping and even discounts. In short i shouldve never wasted my time ordering these from Amazon and you shouldn't either.",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"First thing that sucks:  it's been about 5 months, and the right earbud stopped working.Second thing that sucked about these:  These things constantly fall out of my ears.

"The sound is very tinny, base is practically non existent. Also the sound is definitely weaker out of the left earbud even after trying all possible earpiece combinations which is very annoying and makes me wonder if they sell returned/faulty products as new hoping the buyer would rather just keep them than go through the warranty or return process.",2,1,2020-3-19,1,1,0
"The sound quality is not as good as the AirPods. The only thing good about these is they do secure better into your ears but they do work there selves loose after a little bit of time no matter the wing size or tip I use. The only way to get any sort of bass is to literally shove them deep into your ear canal. Which like I said, they end up working lose. They also do not get very loud. I was very disappointed. The case does feel very nice and they have great charge time.",2,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
"One of the best android truly wireless headphones around. Noise cancellation is passive, but effective; the sound quality of music is excellent; I have not had any issues with people hearing me during a phone call while outside w/ ambient noise. Sometimes I will have interference in the signal from the buds to the phone; but I attribute that more to my 5yr old phone w/ old Bluetooth standard and not the current 5.0",5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
These are absolutley amazing! The person on the other side of the phone can hear only your voice. It does not pick up any of your background noise.... expect if you are driving fast on the highway. Sounds quality is great. Thr 3 mic's were executed perfectly. Battery lasts forever. They fit comfortably in your ear even when working out and doing cardio... they don't fall out. Nice noise cancellation. I've gone through several different ear buds and these are thre best!,5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"I hoped to love these but couldn‚Äôt. I got the blue one and think it‚Äôs really cute. However the sound quality was mediocre. Because I paired them with Apple devices I don‚Äôt think I got the most out of its utilities.When connected to my laptop the sound was breaking up really bad even though I only had Youtube open and was sitting right in front of the laptop. Had to return :/ I‚Äôm a girl and have the tendency to touch my hair quite often, so I kept accidentally touched the touchpad which play/pause and forward tracks. Touchpad is sensitive which can be good but in this case too good that it turns out to be an inconvenience. The fit was just okay, not solid. I also think it‚Äôs overpriced.",3,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0

"The quality is great on these buds but it needs more bass. That's it in a nutshell.Besides that I love the noise cancelation and the ability to find your buds in case you lose them. I admit it, I lost my last pair of razor gaming buds and wish they had the find your buds feature. Invaluable in my opinion.  Until more buds get this feature I'll stay with the Samsung + buds.",4,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"I use the original Galaxy buds. I'm glad to see Samsung the best of times and revamping their software adding a couple of features. Waterproof, and the ability to control ambient sound around you is nice (as is the software suite they updated on their handsets through the Wear app). The wireless charging is fast and convenient, and the fact they added an enormous amount of battery life maybe these an easy choice for me. I wish they offered a couple more colors, but I could say the same about the s20 line as a whole. They stay in my ear when I exercise, and are are comfortable while I'm laying in bed if I don't want to keep the wife awake. if you have never owned a pair I would recommend these over any of the Apple rivals. There are still cheaper alternatives on Amazon that offer fairly similar sound, but if you're fully immersed in a Samsung ecosystem there's no going wrong here.",5,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
These earphones are honestly worth it. The lab features and the earphones had upgraded specs with 22 hours of battery life in total with charging case.iOS compatibility smoothly and there is an option to have it on where if you tap the tip if your ear you can adjust the volume level like that due to the experimental feature but you have to turn it on manually,5,1,2020-2-23,1,1,0
"Incredible earbuds. The ambient nose mode almost works like a hearing aid when turned all the way up, and the battery life is incredible. I've had one of them in my ear for a solid nine hours, constantly playing audio and it's only down to 44%. In fact, the battery life is so good, that I can put one in before work, and leave the case in my vehicle, since that one earbud will easily last the entire 10 hour shift (without ambient on, with it on it'll last about 8 hours).",5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0

"Bought mine in the middle of Feb. They sound great and I used them all the time throughout the day. The noise canceling feature works just the way I like.Beginning of April the connection between the buds to my phone started to go out randomly. I want to say after the last update around that time. I disconnected them and even uninstalled them and now only the right bud has sound. The left one is on but it doesn't connect at all. In the app it just shows as disconnected but it still beeps when I press it. I hoped they would lasted longer, didn't even have them for two months.",3,1,2020-4-10,1,1,0
"I really like these headphones. My only two cons are 1 they fall out of your ear.... I don't like that. Especially if you're working out, these are not headphones for working out. 2.

I bought these Samsung ear buds from amazon and had issues with battery life in the beginning then the right one just failed it was at the 90 mark so I had to send them to Samsung and was told by Samsung these wen't made by them and wouldn't warranty them. So basically Amazon is selling products that are fakes.,1,1,2020-8-14,1,2,0
I absolutely LOVE these...they go so well with my watch & note 9 in sound quality & functionality.  Can't wait to get my note 20 hooked up to them tho my note 9 does an excellent job. You'll be happy with these & yes I bought the extra warranty my ONLY complaint is that I wanted purple to match all my stuff but the red ones are so vibrant & they stand out. The case stays charged for a long time & so do the ear buds.,5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"The sound is decent but my biggest complaint is battery life. The left bud discharges much faster than the right. I made sure both read 100% charge. Listening only to music from my S-10 for 2 hours, the right showed 85% charge left but the left only showed 63%. I tried this twice, getting the same results. No way these would get 11 hours.

Of course over the head ear phones may sound better ... I get it ... but for what they are ... they shine! Buy them!",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
The ear buds are great. They fit well in my ear and they were extremely easy to connect to my cellphone.  I've only noticed one problem; if place the phone in my back pocket I get some breakup in the sound. I don't  know why the sound breaks up because any where else they sound great.The other thing I like is the ability to set how much outside sound you can let in. The setting is great when you want to be more aware of your surroundings.,5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
Terrible product. They have no range. People on the other end can hear all my background noise instead of me talking. No option to lower mic input volume.

It's ridiculous.",1,1,2020-6-12,1,1,0
"I have worn these for working at home. Both to use as calls and to listen to music. You come to better understand the noise reduction when you use the ambient sound feature that allows you to hear the audio ""outside"".

I use these to go walking outside. The call quality is amazing on these first of all. The person on other end can hear me clearly and I can hear them. Best earphones I've had for calling by far.

Other then the left ear bud going out and having to buy new ones I enjoyed them but dang...,3,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
Really like the compact design and longer battery life. Works great with my Samsung devices. You will love it if you use it with Samsung phones. Pairs automatically and never faced any drops. Works well for phone calls as it has a good mic. Nice sound quality with good fit makes it a smart buy. Overall it's a smart buy and would recommend to a friend,5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,1
"Honestly if it wasn't for one flaw with the product I would have given this 5 stars across-the-board. When I received the item and opened it the buds+ were completely dead because they are shipped inside the charger so the buds and the charger gradually kill each others batteries over time.  Buds+ were so low when charger was plugged in it did not recognize buds were in the charger, luckily my friends standard buds charger was able to detect them and got an initial charge on them so my charger could detect them. After that no more issues.  May update review after some time, need to determine if the batteries were left dead for so long it affected memory.  Hopefully Samsung will be made aware of the issue and just put a small piece of tape over the contacts to stop this issue.",4,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"I fought with myself about buying these for MONTHS because I have such small ears and ear buds fall out all the time. Even the kind with the wrap around piece. These don't! They stay in my ears and cancel out EVERYTHING. I wear them at work to listen to podcasts and music and, 99% of the time, I have them turned up just enough to not notice when people are talking to me. :) The battery life for the buds themselves is great, but the case doesn't last too long. I did buy a refurbished pair, so that could be why. Definitely happy with this purchase.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
So when I first put them on and paired them up I was kinda sad a lil disappointed but then I put them in DYNAMIC. I WAS LIKE OMG THIS SH*T IS NICE AF LIKE COME ONNNN. Highly recommend. The bass is nice and full. The highs are vibrant and crispy. Idk how to evaluate mids. Listening to pink Floyd and pop smoke and I gotta tell u it works either way. Fantastic. I got the blue ones and my sister who doesn't give craps about this stuff said they were pretty too. Super good get them,5,1,2020-6-26,1,1,0
"These are the best earbuds I've ever had by far. I've had Sony, JBL, Skullcandy etc- nothing compares.  They immediately connected to my phone (Gs10) and if you have Samsung and lose them you can easily track them through the wearable app (like the watches.) They have excellent battery life, they charge fast and can be charged directly from my phone as well. My Active 2 watch controls them as well and that is super handy since I'll be using them to work out. Look no further these are the best out there right now! Unlike the Sony, they are sweat proof and water resistant, they are comfortable and light weight as well. I hope to have these a few years. I see no reason to upgrade anytime soon.",5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0

Great battery life. Good features. VERY low volume and so so music sound quality.  No matter what I did I couldn't get these things moderately loud enough. If I plug in my V-Moda I can't go above 50% without damaging my ears. With the Galaxy Buds + with every maxxed out it wasn't loud enough to hear all the detail and I don't listen to blasting loud music.  Returning to try the Sony's.,3,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
Wow I'm very impressed with the clear and crisp sound I have with these. They were very surprisingly easy to pair to my galaxy note 10 and the touch features to pause and skip were very responsive as well (using Amazon music app) I would highly recommend.

Secondly they have pretty solid sound quality. Not up to par with Bose, but I‚Äôve tried AirPod pros out before and I think it‚Äôs better then them. Noise canceling is solid.

These are comfortable and have an amazing sound.  They're slightly heavier than the Pixel Buds 2 but they have a little more range and don't occasionally drop the Bluetooth connection.

"I have had zero problems with these earbuds when using them with my Galaxy Note 9, however there is a serious bug with these earbuds. I lost one in the grass when doing yard work and tried using ""find my earbuds"", but it didn't work. The earbuds won't make the chirping noise to help you find them if the app believes they are in your ear, which was a problem because there is no override for this feature if the sensor responsible for this isn't working correctly. What would've been a simple retrieval was ruined by a serious lack of foresight.If you plan on buying these earbuds, be aware that there is a possibility that this may happen.

Maybe I'm just a little OCD but the charging case is slightly offset on the door hinge, but it could just be from normal use although I've only had it a short while.

One thing I really don't like is that you can't buy a replacement charger from Samsung if it you ever lose it. You would need to buy a new set altogether.

If you work in a loud shop and you want to have ear protection while also having the ability to listen to music or toggle ambient noise to talk to people this is what you want.

"After reading some reviews, I opted for the galaxy buds plus over apple air pods, and I am not disappointed. I love the way the samsung buds look, and they work just fine with my mac products. The motivating factor for buying these was to have a better mic than my laptop for video calls and remote teaching, and these buds have delivered both.As an aside, on this posting when you choose 'white' the photo shows blue buds. I figured I would be happy with either, so just went for it. Turns out the buds I got match the photo (they're blue.)",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0

Well this one there is no change and you have to click either twice to go forward and 3 times to go back and there so much more buggy i barely use the controls where the first ones I had no problem and used them quite  a bit.

Touch ear to change songs/volume that's dope! But doesn't get as loud as I'd like. Noise cancelation is there with an optional setting to turn on ambient sound that means you can hear around you. All together awesome tech! With that said there is always room for improvement. Price to Functionality i would say its worth it. My only issue that I can put my finger on is that I wish they got louder. Mind you I can't complain on the volume. Atleast with the noise cancelation. Just got them so can't review the battery.,4,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0

"I was really excited on getting them, however; once I analyzed the buds I realized that the material for the ear piece and the case it's self is very cheaply made (at least when compared to the first generation) and as I was changing the ear wing to a larger size, I noticed that the right one was slightly ripped from the bottom and figured that it would rip over time. I tried to get ONLY the earwing replaced, but costumer support wasn't much help. After talking to several reps, I finally decided to replace the whole product for a new one.

Had the previous Galaxy Buds for 1 year. Thought about replacing them with the Buds+. That thought turned into actually doing it after sending them through the washing machine last week.

as far as fit and sound quality out of box the left bud it was good. long battery life is convenient however the right bud failed to even turn on.

"I used to have JBL free earbuds and the battery life on those was terrible. I switched over to the Samsung Galaxy Buds and it was a game changer. The battery life is about 8 hrs . I drive for a living and battery life is important because it helps me communicate with customers and staff while freeing my hands. Another upside is that each earbud has its own microphone, so if one of the earbuds die you can switch over to the other one. It also comes with its own portable charger to have an even longer battery life.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"The buds are ok. Battery life is great. Few issues. They do not get as loud as I like and thats probably for the best, I am half deaf now lol. That has to do with the lack of noise cancellation. The main issue is the buds drop connection randomly and don't connect correctly all the time to the phone. Also when I'm watching tv or a movie the buds sometimes become staticky and the audio bounces back and forth between buds.",2,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0

"Great sound, but if you're looking for noise cancellation specifically, you're better off looking for another set of buds with noise cancellation. The features on the Wearable app are good to play around with to best suit your preferences. Ambient Noise is super useful, but can sound a bit ""tinny"" if that makes sense. What's most impressive about these is the battery life. After almost 3 weeks of usage, my battery life has not gone below 70% even with extended periods of usage. It may feel uncomfortable to wear at first, but the different wing-tips and buds that come with the package can be switched to best suit you.",4,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0

I use these while working and am talking to the same person for about 8 hours a day. 1 bud will last a solid 6 1/2 hours before having to switch. I have to say that is way better than the air pods for iPhone as I had those when I had an iPhone 11 max pro. The bass in these are great if in the ear properly. The noise cancelling does great and the fact that you can turn on ambient sound with a Samsung is great so I can hear the sound around me even with the noise cancelling.

I might think about buying another pair and getting a pouch or something i can close shut to avoid this in the future. Would highly recommend.,5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"Purchased on February 22, 2020. Left ear bud stopped working in September and I sent it off for warranty repair. The service repair center voided the warranty due to ""damage"" even though it has never been dropped or exposed to water. The cost of repair would have cost $108.97. At that point I might as well buy a different pair from a different brand.",1,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0
"My Bose earbuds stopped charging after less than two years so I switched to Samsung.  What serendipity.  Not only are the Samsung earbuds cheaper, but the ambient sound mode and the equalizer toggle were a pleasant surprise.  Sound quality is fantastic, they are more comfortable, and I look less like Frankenstein's monster while wearing them.  Bose insists upon itself, but Samsung is a rising star.",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"These are awesome little buds, I was originally gonna purchase the first models but upon watching reviews, turns out audio quality wasn't so great and phone calls were horrible. I'm glad I waited till Samsung updated the Galaxy buds and came out with these Galaxy Buds+. No ANC but I feel it's not necessary because the buds+ do a good job with cancelling outside noise with the larger tips. Sound quality is good and touch controls are easy to learn.",5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"Comparing the galaxy buds+ with only the Jabra elite 75t's. The call clarity, hear through, and ease of use is excellent. The major issue is music sound quality. There is really no range to the audio performance, it sounds muddy and lacks bass.",4,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0

"They paired up flawlessly and were very easy to use, but they were extremely uncomfortable right off the bat. I tried the other wing tip and silicone covers that came with the headphones, but they all fit very awkwardly for me and were painful to use for more than an hour. I made sure to always set my music at a moderate volume, but on the second day of use, I noticed fresh blood in my left ear - NOT a great sign. Sad these didn't work out for me. General discomfort and surprise blood are both big dealbreakers for me.",2,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0

"I have a low tone voice that many blue tooth mics make it impossible for people to hear me, even with yelling. These on the other hand, everyone can hear me.

"When i got these, they seemed like tipical buds.  If you push the buds deeper into your ears, you can hear the bass?  That means you need to move up a size in the insert.  I ended up putting in the largest insert and the largest seal ring and oh my gosh!  What a difference!  I'm saying don't write these off untill you try the sizing veriations.

"I love my galaxy buds, the sound quality is awesome and I love the ambient sound thing because it allows me to hear what is happening around me.  I‚Äôve been using my earbuds almost 5 months and I have a good experience with them.  A week ago I sent them to Samsung because I washed and dried the left earbud for almost 1 hour and a half in the dryer, so it didn‚Äôt work anymore, but they repaired it for free and I just received it today. It works PERFECTLY!!!!!!! I‚Äôm so happy. I highly recommend this product.",5,1,2020-9-28,1,0,0
"A bit pricey and was hesitant on spending the money for these. Within the past year I purchased a much cheaper set (not samsung) lasted maybe 8 months then battery was losing charge quickly.  I am definitely impressed with these. Sound quality amazing, comfort in ear is perfect and it comes with different sizes to find your perfect fit.  Noise cancellation like no other! Equalizer for your music adjustment and enjoyment. The app is user friendly and works well with my S9+. Highly recommend.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
Sound quality is actually really good.  Noise cancellation is excellent and you can adjust ambient sound through app which is nice for different uses. Liked them so much bought a second pair! Battery life is the best I've seen from a bluetooth rechargeable ear pod - approximately 12 hours and they hold a charge for days when not in use!  This blue is very subtle but pretty!,5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"I do not like the earbuds that just go in your ear. I have always had the kind that go around your neck. I took a chance buying these. The sound was fine. It worked as expected. But with it being just bus I wanted to make sure I didnt lose them or sit them down anywhere  I bought a keychain case cover to keep with me, to put them away when not in use. I thought the buds locked in to place inside the case. Then when I wanted to use them, they were gone. I guess they fall out the case. I feel it should lock close to avoid this happening.",4,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
Like everything Except it‚Äôs not waterproof .,5,1,2020-9-22,1,1,1

"Do not buy them yet, I bought them just to be really disappointed the left ear bud won't work it keeps disconnecting, it tried everything to fix it and nothing helped.

"I bought these to use while at work, while I cook or if I am out shopping so that i dont have to hold my phone on my ear. Well, they charge up well and stay charged a long time. That is about the only thing I like about them. When I am talking the person on the other end cannot hear me. They also hurt my ear after a few minutes. I felt a headache coming on due to the pain. So, I would not buy these again. I literally only use them to watch Netlflix and hear music. I cannot really use them for a phone conversation.",2,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"I've had three different pairs of these buds that all worked at first, but ran into connection problems very quickly. Normally, these issues would be fixed through different methods such as resetting the product itself, but each time, it was not a matter of connection, but the product itself was faulty. They are not worthwhile unless the buyer gets lucky enough to get a set that actually works properly. For this user's case, they failed to deliver three times, and now I'm stuck with broken sets.",1,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"The sound quality on them is really good, the bass and treble are both on point. You can also adjust the sound quality. The battery life is amazing, I can use one bud for up to two to three day without charge.",5,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
These Galaxy Buds definitely have a better connectivity than the predecessors. The old model used to cut out when I walk with my phone in my hand but these ones only seem to do that if my phone is in my back pocket. Overall these Buds have a great sound quality and also have pretty cool features when you use the Samsung Wearables App.,5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"I bought these mainly because of the battery life. I haven't been able to find any other wireless earphones with the same battery life. In less than 2 weeks, sound stopped coming out of the right ear bud. I bought two  pairs, and the same thing happened twice. Wasn't able to fix it.",1,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0
"Sound quality is amazing in terms of hearing every bit of a song's instruments and small background sounds you wouldn't normally hear but the actual volume of the buds is a bit underwhelming, not extremely disappointed but was expecting higher volume. The 1st generation of airpods has WAY higher volume but doesn't have the quality of sound as these buds so if high volume is what you're looking for these buds aren't for . Everything else is amazing though. Battery life is out of this world as well.",4,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0

The best part about these headphones are the battery life. I've been searching for headphones that will last more than 3 hours. Each earbud charges separately so you can charge the left one while listening to the right. The best part is that it doesn't take long to charge. My case was at 40%while my right headphone was at 25%. I charged it for at most 30 minutes and my headphone was at 60%. Definitely recommend downloading the app so you can get the most out of them.

Because they are so bulky they don't stay in my ears when I move around.  It is difficult for me to switch from listening to music to answering a phone call. Sound quality is good.

Not one con that I can find. Just take your time trying on the different fittments for a perfect seal and seat. These things are amazing.

The product itself is really great. Easy pairing and sound is awesome. My only complaint is the way my package was delivered. Came from an Amazon delivery driver who didnt care about my package at all. I live in a big apt building and he carelessly left my package in front of someone else's door on a different floor. Not even close to my apt #. They really need to work on that!!,5,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
Amazing quality. Love the added extra features of the plus. I had the original Galaxy buds. And lost one of them. I decided to upgrade to the Galaxy buds +. Sound quality is absolutely amazing.

"Great handsfree, mediocre bass quality on speakers. For earbuds which cost almost $150, I would have expected that the sound quality would be a lot better. I want to be able to really feel the bass, especially when I'm listening working out! The reason I kept these earbuds is because the handsfree for calls is excellent! And I really needed that. Overall a 3.5 star for me. If these earbuds cost $50 it would have been a 4 star.",4,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
Sound quality is actually really good.  Noise cancellation is excellent and you can adjust ambient sound through app which is nice for different uses. Liked them so much bought a second pair!

Using the buds for a phone call the user says ‚ÄúI can not hear you‚Äù.  They come with 3 sizer rings but will not stay in my ears. Good for music and books. Use Samsung app to control the buds so they are a little awkward when using other Bluetooth connections for input.,1,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"After years of trying to find wireless buds that fit well and sound great I basically gave up until I received these. They fit so snug and the bass kicks quite nicely.

Bought a second pair because I tried to like them but dont waste your money.  Samsung return policy is a joke.  Sent me an email to fill out and return to listed email on form.  That email is no longer valid so i guess im stuck with 150$ broken buds.  Second pair i bought is flaky too.  Doesnt connect sometime and battery life is awful even with the charging case.,1,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0

"So I bought these hoping they would fix a few things from the original pair of GB's. Mainly call quality and the frequent cut-outs in their connection. While they fixed one of those things, I was disappointed by the other and something completely unrelated changed compared to the original buds.I will start by saying that they did not really fix the connection issues. I tend to keep my phone in my left pocket and with the original buds 90% of the time when reaching in my pocket if my hand covered my phone at all I would get an obnoxious cut-out from the Bluetooth connection. They have sort of improved this over time and it happens maybe 60% of the time now, still too much but it's kind of bearable. I bought the Buds+ hoping this would be fixed entirely since I own a few other TWS that do not ever have this problem. Unfortunately the Buds+ are about on par with the regular Buds in this department. Their range is also not great, I can be less than 5 feet away from my connected device but if there's a wall between me and the device the connection struggles quite a bit.",3,0,2020-7-4,1,3,0
"I bought some of these at Costco for $100. I like a lot about them. You can use either bud by itself. The case/charger is secure, yet it can be opened by one hand. The sound was fine. But people on the other end of phone calls had difficulty hearing me. It seemed to be worse when there was background noise. Best Buy says that they've had to return a lot of these because of the microphone issue. Costco gave me my money back.",3,0,2020-3-2,1,4,0

"I sent in my galaxy buds under warranty for peeling clear coat after 6 months of use. I really loved them but didn't think it was right to have peeling paint so soon. While on the call with Samsung, the customer service rep told me of  buds plus. I instantly offered to pay the difference to get the upgrade rather than the regular buds as replacement. Sadly, they said their policy did not allow it... fast forward to today. I got the replacement and to my surprise, they sent me a buds plus!!! What customer service! This is why I only buy Samsung for my electronics. And yes, the sound and call quality is noticeably improved over the normal buds. Just got off 3 back to back calls and I didn't have to deal with people not hearing me anymore. SWEET~",5,0,2020-3-16,1,2,0
"TL;DR - Good headphones as long as you don't lose one.I had the original Galaxy Buds and loved them. Unfortunately, lost one fishing after having them for a year. Just in time to pick up the new Buds+. Love it right away! The upgrade is decent, not life changing but the longer battery life and other enhancements are good. If own original buds and they work fine, I don't believe it is worth the upgrade but if you're in search of a new pair, these really are good.",4,0,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"I have such mixed feelings about these. I will start off by saying: when they work, they‚Äôre AMAZING. Customer service: AMAZING. Earbuds as a whole... not so much.The sound is great. The seal is great- they aren‚Äôt actually noise cancelling, but they might as well be with how totally they cut off sound around you, which I really liked. The fine-tuning to the touchpads and sound through the Apple app is great.

"These are definitely the best sounding ear buds I've ever used. They are decently bass heavy & sound clear for just about any genre. I listen to mostly rock music, & I can hear the bass drum hit every single time. Thats pretty awesome for ear buds. Keep in mind, you really have to make them fit right to get the best sound out of these. When they first came in, I used the wing tips that came on the buds, and it made it so they didn't go all the way into my ear. They sounded VERY quiet & I thought about returning. After adjusting the tips & finding what fits perfectly. They literally sound like different ear buds now. Even on half volume I can't hear anything around me unless I turn on the ambient sound. Which works wonderfully to. So for sound quality. Id easily give 9/10.Now for the noise cancelation, it works amazing. You can set it up in the Galaxy wear app to turn it off & on by holding down on one of the ear buds. Amazing feature, if I want to hear my surroundings or just drown everything out. I can do that without pulling out my phone. The ambient sound is also pretty clear, & it really picks up the sounds you want. I recommend using the medium setting, worked the best for me! As for noise cancelation I'd give it a 9/10.",5,0,2020-4-11,1,0,0

"These seem like the total package at first glance. They have long battery life, good mics, wireless charging, USB-C, a small case, good sound quality, and even an easily serviceable design. All of those are true and very compelling reasons to keep it around. Unfortunately, there are plenty of turn offs that keep this from being the slam dunk they might appear to be.The most important one is the size. They don't stick out a lot, but they're legitimately painful to wear if you have smaller ears. Very few earbuds fit in my tiny ears, and these were killing my ears and jaw after only 5 minutes of use (with any of the wingtips and ear tip combos).

"I have owned quite a few ear buds in the last several years, but these are by far the best every day buds that I have owned. First off, they stay secure in my ears no matter what activity I'm doing, and they are very comfortable in my ears even after 6 hours or more of continuous use. Sound quality is excellent and adjustable with the handy equalizer within the Galaxy Wearable App. Sound quality during phone calls is excellent and clear for both parties, even in a noisy environment. Ambient outside sound quality is excellent and has adjustable volume levels within the app. At my age it actually works better than my natural hearing. Battery life is excellent and is viewable within the app. They are also rechargeable from the case alone if necessary. I use mine for about 6 hours a day while working, and they still show about 60% charge left afterwards. Initial pairing is a breeze, after which they automatically pair with my phone as soon as they power up. Answering/ending calls, pausing/starting music, adjusting volume up/down are easily done with finger taps to specific points on the buds. Use firm taps to execute commands. If you buy these buds they will quickly become your everyday go to buds.",5,0,2020-6-13,1,1,0
"To use the full features of these you have to install the Galaxy Wearables app. And when you install that it asks for every permission available, including 24/7 location, contacts, ability to install software on your phone, etc. As an added bonus, when you install that app you have to agree that Samsung is allowed to collect and sell your personal information.

I downloaded the Samsung Wear app (as recommended) and tried all different setting there, which didn't fix it.  I tried all different phone settings to make it better, but they were just too quiet (you needed them set into the orange volume warning to hear at a normal level) and sounded flat.  I found an equalizer app that helped.  But let's face it, for that much money, they should just work right.  Maybe I got a dud, because the reviews are great, but these seemed defective or just not worth it.

"I have samsung everything - the galaxy watch active, the s8+ (still), the TV, even the buds. I've had the buds for several months now and they were honestly great. But after about 5 months I started experiencing problems (which is why I rated everything a 1 star). The buds will connect to my phone, however the audio will be dramatically reduced, sometimes in both or just 1 of the buds. I was able to fix the problem by resetting them through the galaxy wearables app. I continued to do that for a few months and the other day I think they totally crapped out on me (still less that 1 year of owning them). Currently both buds connect to my phone but only audio from the right bud is working. The left bud produces audio but barely audible - it's really annoying. I tried everything to troubleshoot these, I reset them, unpaired them, uninstalled the app, turned by bluetooth off, and then repaired everything and still doesn't work. I contacted samsung to have them repaired as they are still under warranty but apparently I bought an international version on amazon directed toward latin america and samsung USA cannot repair those. They said I would have to send them to Samsung latin america which would cost me more than the buds themselves. Amazon has also refused to help me whatsoever even though the product only listed that it was international in the small print of the product features 3/4 down the page (I thought that was pretty misleading). Anyway, I'm stuck with these garbage headphones now and pretty much SOL. I did purchase my gf a pair of airpods about 1 year ago and I will say she uses them everyday and has never experienced any sort of issue with them. I guess you get what you pay for. It pains me to say this as a samsung phone owner, but I will probably be buying the airpods or the google pixel buds come November. Hope this helps.PS: this issue is apparently very common from what I've found on the internet while trying to fix them.

"I'll start by saying the audio on these is fantastic when paired with my iPhone, the battery life is solid, and they're fairly comfortable, although after a couple hours of use my ears do get a tiny bit sore. My biggest complaint is that I can't pair them with my Macbook Pro, which makes them unusable for about 50%+ of the audio that I listen to. They just don't show up under Bluetooth devices. I've tried troubleshooting the issue ad nauseum to no avail. The samsung website says they can pair with any bluetooth device, and I've never had an issue pairing other headphones or audio devices with my laptop. So if you just want to use them with your phone, go for it.

"The earbuds worked very well with my phone, great sound quality and connection. However, both with and without a Bluetooth dongle, they could not connect well with my laptop.

"I had asked my wife to purchase these earbuds for my birthday based on the glowing reviews. Unfortunately they didn‚Äôt live up to the hype. The sound is no better than my Apple AirPods. I was hoping for a better low frequency response. The unusual wing design makes them rather difficult to place in your ears - you really have to jam them in. Probably the most annoying thing though is that when you touch them whatever music app you listened to last kicks in, even if you‚Äôre on a Zoom call! I do like the red color though.",1,0,2020-8-12,1,0,0

"So for the price of basically $150.00 you get tinny mono sounding ear buds which have great tech inputs, but even using the app + choosing dynamic equalizer, these are still like 15-25 sounding ear buds. These earbuds are preset to prioritize: 1. Treble -> 2. Bass -> 3. Mids (instrumentals).The treble is quite nice, the voices are very distinct, but the bass is a bit muted, and has no feeling or soul to it - and then the mids - wow. It doesn't even exist! It's very very drowned out.",1,1,2020-2-15,1,1,0
"The reason i bought these when they first were released was due to two important factors for me. 1. the ability to use the left or the right earbud independantly. 2 was the ability to have two devices connected at the same time. My computer and my phone connected without needing to disconnect from the other when using. There have been reviews where people have said this is possible. Well after getting these buds, setting the up and trying them out..I have to say THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL. sure you can pair them with two devices but you they will disconnect from one while using the other. I can not listen to music on my computer and have the ability to receive a phone call and talk through the buds without disconnecting from the computer. FAIL..my Jabra Elite 65T can do that. the other issue with these which is the reason i'm returning them is when i put on Ambient sound I get a horrible ringing and buzzing in each ear. when I tun it off, they sound great. Again, my Jabra Elite 65t have a great ambient sound feature that just works. If Jabra would update these to be able to use the left or the right alone..they would be perfect. I'm hoping I got a bad pair of buds, i'm going to try one more pair.",2,1,2020-2-18,1,5,0
"I will preface by saying that I have been in the market for some 'Truly Wireless' Earbuds for the past few months.I went through the Jabra Elite 75t, to the Jaybird Vista to these. If you're like me, you want some earbuds you can pop in and forget. I wanted to strike a balance between audio and functionality as I do enjoy exercising without wires. While the review feels a bit rushed, I can give a first impression of the Samsung Galaxy buds+ compared to my previous choices. I will keep the alternatives succinct listing only the features that I find noteworthy when comparing. Any features not mentioned were lackluster or not worth mentioning.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,5,0
I received the Galaxy buds+ today and I connected them to my iPhone XS Max. So far my experience with these buds are great! Connecting them was simple thanks to the galaxy buds+ app. Glad it could be installed on my iPhone. I do like AirPods other than them falling out of my ears from time to time. I couldn‚Äôt afford the AirPods pro at this time that‚Äôs why I purchased these buds. Therefore I can‚Äôt give you a comparison of the pros and the buds plus. They do in my opinion sound better than the regular AirPods. I‚Äôm impressed with the sound quality and from what they say about the battery life I won‚Äôt be complaining about that either. They fit amazingly in my ears and I don‚Äôt have to worry about them falling out. I‚Äôm glad I purchased these and they will be my earbuds of choice for awhile. Eventually I will purchase AirPod Pro but for now I‚Äôm quite satisfied. I hope your experience with these buds are as good as mine. The call quality is also great!! No complaints from me. Hope you all will have a great experience too. I say go for it if you haven‚Äôt already!!,5,1,2020-2-15,1,5,0

"I bought a pair in May and they broke not even two months later. They never went anywhere near water and were used exclusively for music during exercise and everyday music. One day the left earbud started to get quiet and eventually stopped working. I sent it in and they claimed that the warranty was void due to ""penetration"" damage and asked that I pay the repair fee before even telling me how much it would be. The repair fee for a single earbud by the way is $104. The guy on the phone did not explain what that meant very well but from what I heard from him, it meant that there was some kind of water damage. Again, it was never near any water.Extremely disappointed in Samsung as I am a customer of several products. I would NOT recommend this overpriced product.",1,1,2020-8-3,1,3,0
I am a UPS driver and used this product for a month and a half before I started having problems. Left one would not charge properly and right one at full volume could barely be heard.

"I bike everywhere. I bought these earbuds specifically because they offered Ambient mode, so I could hear traffic. It turns out, the Ambient mode kind of sucks. Essentially, it puts you on a skype call with the outside world: speech is understandable, but it amps up certain frequencies (footsteps, car tires, and air conditioners are all super loud) while leaving others alone. I should have seen this coming, but I thought with 3 mics and an equalizer they could do better than they've done. On top of that, the microphones get overwhelmed with wind noise at anything above 10mph, and you get constant crackling. Between these issues, Ambient mode is totally useless when biking.Fortunately, these earbuds have a second feature that kept me from returning them: You can use either earbud, independently, and it works *really well*. Not only can you switch from left-only, to both, to right-only, while playing music, without dropping any audio or so much as skipping a beat... when you put one of the earbuds back in the case and close it, it automatically plays both channels out of the remaining earbud. You can try this yourself by playing a song with distinct left and right channels. I recommend Such Great Heights by The Postal Service: the intro beeps alternate between left and right ears, it sounds super wrong if you're just listening to one ear normally. Try it with both earbuds in, then take one out, notice that you're missing half the beeps. Put that earbud back in the case and close it, and the missing channel will get added back into the remaining earbud. This is *amazing*, and a really difficult thing to do technically, I'm very impressed.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,2,0
"When I first put the Buds in, they sounded rather tinny, like the cheap headphones the iPod used to come with.  But then I discovered a few things that helped make them sound really fantastic.First of all, make sure you're using the correct size ear piece.  If it's too small, sound will leak past and it'll sound much less than awesome.  The Buds come with the medium-size ear pieces installed.  Those were adequate to keep them in place, but switching to the large ones really helped seal off outside noise and improve the sound quality.",5,1,2020-4-29,1,2,0
"Summary: not worth the hype. Instead, buy Sennheiser Momentum earbuds. You won‚Äôt look back.I tested Apple AirPods vs Samsung Buds+ (2020) vs Sennheiser Momentum.",3,1,2020-3-4,1,2,0
"I have experimented with all of the included ear pieces and finally found the one that actually sounded the best.  However, it is very uncomfortable to wear for any longer than 10-15 minutes.  My ears start to hurt.  This is my first pair of out of the box earbuds.  I own a pair of custom Ultimate Ears earbuds for music.  I can have them in all day and they are fine, but then again, they were molded to my ears.  These are very painful.  I have tried just about every combination, but in order to get one that does not hurt, there are no mids or bass.  Very difficult to hear people talk on the phone unless I am using the largest buds.  Those are the only ones that will seal them off.  When they are sealed, the sound is only ok, nothing to write home about.  The battery life so far has been incredible and I love how they just start charging when you place them in the case.  The other nice thing is the fact that when they do die, you can give them a really quick charge.  I am on my phone almost all day and will be using these for backup only.  I will be going back to my plantronics headset that I can wear all day long and not even know it is there.",3,1,2020-5-17,1,2,0
"ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I desperately wanted to love these earbuds, after all they've gotten pretty stellar reviews.The case feels solid, has a nice snap whenever you close it, the synching is pretty easy. The buds themselves fit perfectly in my ear out of the box. The controls were simple and intuitive enough.",1,1,2020-3-24,1,2,1
I was so excited to hear that the new buds would multi device (which was a main feature for me). Sound and all that is good. I live by the ambient sound feature. The app that controls there buds is awesome. battery life exactly what i needed. I have a note 9 so the connection is seamless all you have to do is open the case and it does everything. Controls are almost fluid (still have to get volume to work more frequently)Now onto Samsung's half truth. Multi device was was not stated clearly by Samsung. It does have it but only works with other Samsungs tablets. I Don't think it works with their laptops which is a shame.,3,1,2020-2-24,1,3,0
"They're quite good, especially compared to the Apple Airpod 2's. Most reviews on YouTube compare these headphones to the Airpod Pro's, which is unfair, because the Airpod Pro's are $100 dollars more, and not meant to compete with one another really. For me, the swappable rubber tips and wings of the Air bud+ headphones are superior to others I've tried, these headphones fit extremely well into my ears, and give me a great seal. They stay in even better than standard wired earbuds like Beats and other brands, which I own as well. I can even chew food while wearing these without losing a seal. Having AKG tune these was a smart move by Samsung, the headphones have a studio quality to them and are very clear. Their soundstage is upfront, and bass is delivered in a manner that is true to most recording types. I have seen reviews that claim these are not bass-heavy headphones, and they're not, but don't believe anyone who tells you that bass is lacking. They have more bass than what I was led to believe after watching a dozen YouTube reviews. Battery life is industry leading, and I have never come close to running out, even after wearing them all day at work. The capacitive touch feature works really well, and you will never fumble around looking for a button on these, being that there's no physical buttons that must be pushed in, you won't be readjusting your headphones from having to mash them into your ears like on the Jabra's after a button press. The only critique I could mention with these headphones is that I wish they were even louder. I normally listen to music at a level that is borderline unsafe, and most wired headphones will give me that. Wireless bluetooth headphones on the other hand have to balance battery life and longevity with all of their features, so most won't play at the blistering levels that I prefer. Really though, I am stoked that I bought these headphones, I don't always make a satisfying choice when I purchase electronics, but I feel 100% with these. The Android and iPhone apps are really well done also.",4,1,2020-7-12,1,1,0

"I loved the quality of the sound from these buds.  I doubt you will find better and they likely rival many wired earphones.  They fit well, feel comfortable and all of the features work great.My only problem and one that may make me return them is the latency when watching tv.  I expect it is hard to find worse latency.  Using the same setup, these thing are clearly awful and make using them for tv impossible unless you pay no attention to the lip sync.

"I bought them because I wanted to call my elderly mom, who's several states away, a couple of times a week during my commute to work.  The A/C in my car is marginal, so I drive with the windows down.  It was either a dedicated Bluetooth headset for calling at about the same price (but that's a one-trick pony) or these because of the zillion reviews I'd read or watched, these averaged more good phone call reviews than anything else anywhere near this price point.Before I tried calling the first time, I had a chance to check out the sound quality, music-wise.  I was disappointed.  I have them paired with a Note 8 and although I expected a little quality loss just due to them being wireless, still, it wasn't what I'd hoped for at $150.  I was seriously considering boxing them back up.  Then I remembered I should probably try adjusting the audio settings through my phone with them on.  BIG difference.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,1,0
"Hey ya'll....so here's my quick review.  I started with the Jaybird Vistas....LOVED them, but they're built to be in-destructible and lack a lot of features that are now available on most wireless headphones.  Plus, the buttons are kinda tricky to press.  I started with a black pair of Buds Plus, but they overheated a couple times when i was hiking so i opted for the white pair (less sun absorption, etc).  Had the white pair for a while and love them, honestly no issues at all.  They stay connected when i walk around OUTSIDE my house doing yard work, they cut out sometimes if i get really far away.  Customizing the buttons is essential, the touch sensitivity of the buttons is pretty spot on.  The tapping outside of your ear for volume up and down opens up the door for these headphones to literally have a button for everything!  Charging cause is super slim, USB C and wireless charging...awesome.  They are super light, you don't even know you're wearing them.  Ambient noise option is perfect for hiking so i can hear someone behind me or if i'm walking down the street, i can hear a car.  The ONLY thing that blew my mind with these headphones....is you CANNOT TURN THEM OFF!  They have to be IN the case and the case HAS to be closed before they turn off and disconnect from your phone.  That took some getting used to...i feel like this is kinda dumb as maybe i don't want to charge my headphones EVERY single time i pull them out of my ears?  Just odd.  Anyways, overall love the headphones!!  Great price for what you get, a lot of the other headphones out there have some short comings or you sacrifice connection quality or sound control, these you get it all!  Thanks!",5,1,2020-5-4,1,1,0
"Decided to buy Galaxy Buds + after having used cheaper $20 Anker wireless buds for 2 years.  I have an iPhone but did not like the style/cost/color of the new Airpods, so was looking for a good alternative.  Various articles said that the Galaxy Buds + worked in the iOS system perfectly, but when I received the Buds, I quickly found that it works fine in iOS via the bluetooth connection, but you can't access any of the advanced features (ambient noise, equalizer, setup, etc) without installing the app.NOTE:  The app does not work AT ALL with iPhone 6s or below.  It checks your phone hardware, and even with the correct iOS version, it just flat out refused to run on the device.  Further, Samsung doesn't say this but it didn't work on my first-gen iPad Pro either.  Same thing - absolute refusal to run even with iOS 13.6.1 (requires 10+).  I didn't have a device that could set up the headphones, leaving me with a basic bluetooth device.  Samsung unapologetically offers no alternative way to access the basic functions of the equipment.",3,1,2020-8-29,1,1,0

As other reviewers have pointed out, the charging case has no latch.

"So I just received the Samsung Buds +, right out of the box, they required a charge which went quick.  I'm happy about that.  I did purchase the Airpod Pros and I really didn't like the fact they didn't stay in my ear.  I tried all 3 sizes and none had a good fit.  These Buds+ right out of the box fit great, I think it has something to do with the wing that secures the bud in the ear and are very comfortable.The app for the iPhone works very well.

"I use uncompressed files for music.  The audio on this set is horrible. No bass and weak thin mids with the highest frequencies almost twice as loud. The volume has to be way up in the red to listen at average volume and starts distorting even at low volume. Using Poweramp app helped level the sound out by lowering the high frequencies as they start to hurt your eardrums very quickly.  Any attempt to bring the bass or mids in caused instant distortion. They simply can only carry high frequencies and not any reasonable volume level. There is high levels of noise sometimes as if the volume level is up high but with low output from the audio track.  I was severely disappointed and find the $5 drug store earphones much better for music though these have better treble. Through the noise,high distortion and low levels, music is immediately unpleasant. The ambient noise feature works well but I was able to use an app for that on standard headphones anyway. I'm awaiting feedback from others regarding call experience when talking to me.",2,1,2020-3-31,1,1,0
"For $150 and being made by Samsung, I would've assumed the audio would be tolerable to say the least. These sound barely better than the Samsung buds I got with my S10 lmao. I never liked earbuds because the audio was always bad and fell out, but still. These don't fall out but the audio is not worth the $150 price tag. I'll stick to my headphones or eventually try a more expensive model from Sony/Sennheiser/etc.",1,1,2020-3-22,1,3,0
"The infamous sony wireless earbuds, which everyone raves over, do sound better than these, and the Apple AirPods Pro Sound significantly worse than these.Buds+ are a solid buy for Apple and Android users, and I use mine for both. The huge advantages they have over other headphones is the quality of the ambient sound feature, the two driver design gives them far more range than Apple Pros, the case is 1/10 the size of the Sony case, and the buds last longer than the Sonys.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,1,0

There have been several updates since I purchased these and the ambient noise function has been significantly improved. I was hearing a lot of wind before, but now it is minimal enough to the point that my mind can zone out the rest. As for call quality, I like to chat on the phone with friends and family while running and so far nobody has complained. Of course they can tell I'm outside doing something like running but we don't have issues with communication. The last thing I'll say is the battery is CRAZY! I run about 14-16 hours a week. If I forget to charge throughout the week it's not even an issue as I'll still have plenty of charge to last the next week over. That is insane. I plan to use these in some ultramarathons where I'll be out there 12-24 hours continuously.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,1,0
"These are waaayyy better than the previous models (Galaxy Buds 1)....the ambience is nice...I can hear people talking while music is playing...as long as the music's not too loud, you can converse with people around you...and I can hear people about 15ft away from me in a different room talking...can't understand what they're exactly saying but, I know there are people in the other room talking...pretty cool....you can still hear yourself as a muffled internal voice, but you can also hear what you are saying via the extra mic they put in this model of Bud+...pretty cool....I gave my AirPods PRo to the wife, she's on the iPhone and I moved to the Note 10+. Overall, very happy with this purchase....easily worth 150$!! They're the same build as previous, nothing changed physically, however, the touch pad is more pearl like finish. The life of the battery is what ultimately sold me on these as they're supposed to have 11 hrs of use...I haven't got that far with them cause I only received them today....",5,1,2020-2-25,1,1,0
I had the original buds and the only weakness it had was its poor call quality. It had a good sound and were very comfortable to wear for very long periods of time.The new buds + fixes the 1 complaint I had with the original buds while improving the ambient sound feature drastically. Ambient sound was just OK before but now it sounds great and natural depending on the level you set it to. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I prefer the sound of the original buds over the buds +. The bass response was better with the old buds in my opinion but I'd still recommend these over the originals.,5,1,2020-2-16,1,1,0
"First of all, I had a different, much cheaper brand of wireless earbuds before this. The sound was good, but they didn't have nearly the features of these Galaxy Buds +. When they stopped working, my search began for a decent priced pair of earbuds that would be awesome for me, and these fit the bill! I was slightly hesitant seeing that they only have an IPX2 rating. I love to listen to my earbuds mostly when I workout, so worrying about sweat was something that made me push off my purchase of these for a while. I finally decided to just go for it, and I'm so glad I did! Here's what you need to know.. these are pretty great. They have a warranty and also you can purchase an extended warranty through Amazon. I absolutely purchased the warranty because these were not cheap, and I'd like to protect them as long as I can before a new version comes out maybe. When you get the buds, they come in a small box. Nothing extra fancy, and very basic looking. I didn't mind this at all! You get a small cardboard insert with your various ear tips and wings, along with a short charging cord. When you connect these to your phone, (i have a galaxy s9) the connection was easy and flawless! The galaxy wearable app shows you all different settings and the amount of battery life your buds have. I loved playing with the ambient sound, It was amazing what I could hear through these things even with music playing! The ambient sound even at its loudest will still be difficult to hear someone talking or whatever if your music is up fairly loud. Still an awesome feature to have! You have different things the buds do when you tap them a certain number of times, and you can set it up where a triple tap or holding the button does something different of your choice. Like, open your virtual assistant. The sound quality of these is great. I prefer to listen in dynamic mode, via the in-app equalizer. None of the sounds are flat or falling through, you get a really rich, great sound with these! One of my favorite things about these versus my old earbuds is, for example,  when you double-tap the right bud, it skips to the next song. You hear two small beeps, but you don't hear a voice saying ""forward "" every time! I love this aspect! It was getting old hearing voice feedback every time i did anything on the old buds.  Overall,  these are excellent bang for your buck! I have had no issues with sweat getting in them and hurting them,  and I workout 4 times a week pretty heavy! Just wipe them clean and dry afterwards and good to go! If you're interested in these,  look no further! The whole experience with these has been great so far.  If anything changes I will update this review, but so far I am highly impressed!",5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,1
"So I was excited to upgrade from my Galaxy Buds to the new Galaxy Buds+ today. The extra battery kife, 11 hours, meant I could wear the buds longer each day. And the improved sound is anazing.But there is a feature that has not been touted yet and I think it makes these Buds+ number 1. It's the ambient noise feature. It includes options to increase ambient noise volume and I love it. I have a hearing loss issue and could use hearing aids. But these buds+ actually allow me to hear much better without expensive hearing aids.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,1,0
"Brand new out of the box, charged for 1 hour, left bud connects (Galaxy Note 10+), right bud does not.Forgot them on bluetooth, forgot them in app, uninstall all, reinstall app - same thing.",1,1,2020-5-28,1,2,0
"Either the abundant amount of excellent reviews is suspect or everybody has very poor taste in audio quality.  If you understand audio you'll know what I mean when I say they sound out of phase. No matter what EQ mode you put them in its awful.  Horrible second rate EQ settings as well.  The mids and highs are VERY fatiguing, brittle, shrill.  The bass is lacking even with a good fit.  They sound like a dollar store set of wired headphones.  Not impressed at all.I fought with one of the buds for a number of hours.  It refused to charge or respond at all.  I don't know what happened but it eventually began charging. They seem to behave a little better than the latest Apple products which isn't saying much.  The current iteration of bluetooth for two separate devices that pair isn't reliable at all.",2,1,2020-6-19,1,1,0
"I use them everyday with my iPhone. Much more than I ever thought.I like the battery life, sound quality is good but don't except it to be good as wired headphones.  They get loud, but sometimes I wish they were a bit louder.",4,1,2020-6-29,1,1,0
"I'm a huge samsung guy. I have a samsung phone, samsung laptop,  samsung tv. The brand has never failed me. These headphones are really good. Sound is great. Nice features. Price is a little high then what I'm used to paying for other headphones  but I guess its becuase it name brand and really isent far off from similar name brand earbuds. The ambient sound feature is nice as well but I noticed when I turned that on when I run I hear lots of wind that the microphone catches. So I had to turn it off then it was fine. After I was done I turned it back on and it was kinda cool I dident have to take off my earbuds to talk to people. The samsung wear app let's you change alot more settings then I'm used to so that's a convient feature. The battery is a great bonus to. 11 hour off one charge and 11 more with the carrying case. Bottom line I'm very happy with them. Great sound, battery life and the look and feel are great!",4,1,2020-3-18,1,1,0
"I bought these after doing a good bit of online research comparing them to Airpods Pro and others but am utterly underwhelmed by the actual product. So much so that I actually prefer my $30 bluetooth ear pods over these.Battery life: The battery life is advertised as 11 hours but with the pair I got, what I found is that they lose charge by the end of the day (probably in about 11 hours) with or without use. So you have to charge them every day for them to work. My cheap ear buds have to be charged only once every few days.",2,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0

"These earbuds are fantastic. I reccomend using the dynamic setting on the app. The bass setting loses way too much of the high end. AKG who makes these is a brilliant German company who makes a fine product. If you have a newer Samsung phone the earbus that came with it are AKG, but are there cheapest available which you can purchase foe under $20 and are pretty weak, so don't exrect anything like that because you get every bit of what you pay for. The touch pads are also very nice. The build quality is great. Charging is quick and convenient with a wireless QI pad. I also bought a the case cover that has the chrome trim and a keychain clip which I attach to my belt loop and can still put the case in my pocket knowing I will now lose them. The QI pad charges through the added case. I have had other brands and these are the best wireless I have had.",5,1,2020-4-6,1,1,0
"I gave this Samsung earbud a 5, because it is a good example of a quality product for what it is. Keep in mind, that it doesn't have the sound quality of my floor-standing Infinity speakers - nor should it. It's a wireless earbud. But, for a set of tiny speakers, the sound is pretty darn good. I use them when I ride my bike on an indoor trainer, for motivational music. I've transferred my entire digital music collection to my Samsung Galaxy S8 phone, which has a 256G memory card. Over time, I've tried several sets of wired earbuds, which didn't work for me. My knee hit the wire to the phone, and the earbuds kept falling out, particularly when eating an energy bar during the ride. Not surprisingly, these earbuds paired up very easily with my Samsung phone, using an Android app. The app gives a wide range of features, including an equalizer (which I tested on Jefferson Airplane's ""3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds and Nico's ""Femme Fatale."" Normal worked better on the former, dynamic on the latter). Best of all, they stayed in my ears, comfortably, even when eating (though they amplified the bone sensation of chewing). There are three ambient sound settings. Full ambience is too wide open for me, and no ambience really restricts outside sound. The medium setting allows me to hear my insulin pump tell me to eat, and I can hear my pedal cadence. I received a robocall during my ride this morning, and the sound quality was good - I disconnected via the phone. While preparing for my ride, I found that the Bluetooth pairing was effective for a couple of hundred feet, and beyond that, the signal broke up; since I only use the buds while riding, that's not a problem. Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase.",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"I have been waiting for this earbuds' price to come down and Amazon recently had a special on this with the Samsung wireless charger included free. So I jumped at the opportunity and purchased it.SOUND QUALITY. It's not the best compared to an over-the-ear headphone like the Sony WH-100XM3 but it is decent. If you like a heavy lows/bass, this is not for you. The lows are subtle and not over powering even when you select the preadjusted EQ (Bass Boost from the Samsung Galaxy Wearable App that you download from Google Play). It seems all the PREADJUSTED EQ from the app (Normal, Bass Boost, Soft, Dynamic, Clear, Treble Boost) are all subtly adjusted with very minute differences from each other. The good news is that you can customize the EQ to your liking using your mobile's system audio EQ (specially if you have a Samsung Galaxy) or a third party EQ app.  The overall volume level is a little too low. At 70% volume (recommended listening levels by manufacturers), it is a bit low compared to other earbuds/headphones. However, you can also adjust and add extra volume to it using the Galaxy Wearable app.",4,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
i am so happy i upgraded to the new version from the regular buds.the battery life is nice and i use them all day every day one ear at a time. however that is not a reason to upgrade nor is the possible sound upgrade. the only reason to do it is if you want to use it for calls. the older version is all but the same thing other then this. i could not use it for calls at all. no one could hear me at all. it was useless for calls and very much a pain in the ass. the new version works perfectly as a call head set and gets about 2 hours more play time.,5,1,2020-3-6,1,1,0

"Disclaimer, I have only been using these a few weeks. I will update as needed 06/15/2020These have been fantastic. Got tired of the cheaper ones konking out on me, so I decided to splurge a little on something pricey, and I would gladly buy these again. I'm no audiophile, so most I can say on that is they're great quality sound for me, but the real value is the ambient sound function. I have to carry a radio at work, so I used to have to do the one earbud thing,  uncomfortable and easy to lose track of where a sound came from. These earbuds you can set to pickup sounds around you and balance it with your music/audiobook,  allowing you to hear the rest of the world clearly without having to take them out. It takes some getting used to, but it's fantastic.",4,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"I've usually avoid Bluetooth as it usually sounds terrible.  These earbuds sound great however and I love the feature where I can hear some ambient noise.However the bluetooth connectivity of these is pretty horrible, and it seems to happen whenever I turn my head to the right.

Samsung is an innovator and is one of the few companies that continues to be a top technology beast.  I own more Samsung devices than any other products from the other manufacturers. I may have put the bar too high when it came to the buds plus and am admited audiophile.  But I also know this company is up to the challenge.

"I'm very happy with nearly every aspect of these buds, but after 1.5 months of use one bud became nearly silent.I've researched this problem and found a fair number of other people have experienced the same thing.  I have tried all the solutions I've read about, short of opening up the bud.  The bud appears to receive charge....if I 'use' it along with the other bud, charge% does go down as reflected in the phone app.  I can then charge the bud (by itself to make sure), and the charge light stays red for an appropriate amount of time.  I've thoroughly inspected the bud for clogs in the speaker, and cleaned the bud anyway, but found no problem there.  I will probably send these in for warranty service.",2,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
My initial impression is that I'm blown away! The original galaxy buds were wonderful but the buds+ are a massive improvement. Here is a list of improvements I felt are notable-Sound quality is incredible. Crystal clear seperation of sounds with balanced bass. The wearable app has preset settings to fit your taste as well.,5,1,2020-2-17,1,1,0
"These are cute. These fall out of my ears. I lost one of the for about 3 months. That was irritating as only 1 ear bud lasts a good 4 hours at work due to battery life. So I didnt get to listen to a book or music for most of my day at work with 1 ear bud. Moving on, when windy or jogging outside the wind is irritating because it interrupts whatever is coming thru my microphone. Maybe there is a setting I'm not aware of. Also since this is my 1st summer with these I've noticed they over heat quickly.  They beep in my ear. So if you want to do yard work or walk around an amusement park on a hot day forget about it. I'm so sorry about this review because the sound is amazing. The base is out of this world. I feel like I'm in a club. Maybe there are settings for some of the minor things that I'm not aware of and wouldn't mind someone letting me know. As far as heating up, that a thumbs down!",3,1,2020-7-17,1,1,0
"First, the bad... I hope this was just a one time issue but I got a very loud buzzing sound in the left bud that hurt my ear. I had to power it down and reset it to make it stop. So far it hasnt happened again. Ive only used them 3 times so far. I also am a bit iffy about there not being a latch to close the case. The last version had a button to press to open them. So I do worry they will come open in my bag.The good... I love Galazy buds, and these are great. The improvements are clear as soon as you put them on. The way they fit better and actually stay in my ear unlike the last version.  The connection to my phone ,firetv or playstation is great & quick. The last version I had to constantly re-pair them. They also pair very easily, just open the lid and done.  All the settings are done through your phone or Samsung tablet. So you will need to do that before using them with anything because the volume is low by default. Also you can reset the bud touchpad for volume control. Imo is much better than the previous version where everytime I put them in my ears it played all factiry tracks which was so annoying.  They also dont turn off or pause when I turn my head like the previous version did.  Last but not least,  I love the blue color!",3,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
I didnt think I needed a BT headset but thats because I didnt have a pair.  These are excellent.  As soon as I got them out of the package I started testing their capabilities.First test was phone calls.  I found the call quality to be almost perfect.  Both ends of the call were very clear but when I tested the range the call got echoey at about 25-30 ft when maintaining line of sight to the phone.  Going around corners the call got echoey.  I went for a little walk and I didnt have any issues with the connection at all.  Outside noise is blocked out well and  I can turn on the ambient noise feature to hear the outside world if I want.  This feature works very well and has adjustable levels using the app.,4,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"I just upgraded to these from the first generation of Samsung Galaxy wireless earbuds. I recieved them on time and in good condition. I think the sound quality is well balanced and Samsung gives you six options with their preset Equalizer which includes a Bass Boost setting, Normal, Clear Voice, Dynamic, Normal, Soft, and Treble Boost. Do they sound like a set of kickers thumping no, but they are well balanced and sound great. The biggest problem with the 1st gen. was the microphone picked up too much background noise and people had a hard time hearing you if you were on a busy side walk, wind, or noisy car, so far it seems like Samsung was able to improve the microphone with noise cancelation. If that changes over the next couple weeks I will update my review, but so far so good. The other problem with the first generation was a update that was sent out for the Samsung app. after downloading it caused my earbuds to register as two separate devices and I could only use one bud at a time. Samsung did ask me to send them back so they could fix or replace them, but I had bought a different brand and was waiting on the new version to come out, so I never sent them back, but I will say Samsung stands behind their products and customer service is above average.",4,1,2020-5-27,1,1,0
"I've been searching for quality earbuds with all of the features I want and I've finally found them in the Galaxy Buds+. I poured over page after page of wireless earbuds on Amazon, reading specs and watching Youtube video reviews. I was about to purchase the Mifo 07 earbuds when my woman told me about the Galaxy Buds+ that just came out so I decided to check it out. Although I preferred the look of the Mifo 07 and its compactness, the Galaxy Buds+ won me over with its single charge battery life and ambient mode. I like the fact that you can customize what the touchpad does in the Galaxy Wear app. It also has different EQ options. The buds will also start the music when you put them in your ear and pause when you take them out. A feature I didn't know about. They also have seamless switching from single to dual buds with no music interruption which is another feature I was looking for. The ""find my earbuds"" feature is a nice touch and something I haven't seen with other earbuds. You activate it from the app and the earbuds will chirp like a baby bird so you can find them. lol Oh and they also sound great with the 2-way speakers. I have my volume controls set to double tap on the earbud edge which frees up the center touchpad for other functions. The only thing I don't like is how slippery they are. You kind of have to fumble around to dig them out of your ears. lol Not a deal breaker though. Overall, I'm very happy with them.",5,1,2020-2-17,1,0,1

"I've used inexpensive bluetooth earbuds for a long time and never paid more than $30.  I typically go through a pair every 2-3 years due to drops and other abuse.  For me, the most important feature is reliable control via a tap of the ear.  I absolutely have no sense of control with these earbuds and I have to constantly adjust their fit which means I never know when I'm accidently hitting a control ""touch point"".  Even worse, after turning off the touch feature due to engaging random controls the buds will still accidently hang-up if I adjust the bud to my ear.That's not ok.  Sound quality was just ""meh"" while noise cancellation was really good.  That said, my last straw was the battery life.  The charging case seems to discharge even when the buds are out of the case.  When I pay a premium price for a product I expect premium performance.  I do not get that with the Samsung Buds Plus.  Fortunately I am within 1 day of my return period and am able to get my money back.",2,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0
"I love that they just fit and work! I don't have to try to twist them around in my ears to get a good fit, change the fittings, or troubleshoot Bluetooth. They just fit easily, work well, and pair with my phone (Moto G6) easily. I have used them mostly for hour long business phone calls, hiking, and listening to workout music while I workout. I can do planks, pushups, side planks, and they don't fall out. I bought a cheaper version of these types of earbuds, different brand, just to try out the style, 6 months ago. They were about half the price of these and just wouldn't stay in my ears. II ended up getting rid of them and trying these.  This might be the case where you get what you pay for.  I wish I'd bought these originally, but I didn't know if I'd actually like them, but I really do.  I also like wearing one while I'm riding my bike around town for music, no cord to get caught anywhere.  I'm very grateful for a quality, non airpod option.  I only gave them 4 stars because I want to test using them to record myself teaching a fitness class.

"If I were to describe these headphones using the full spectrum of the colorful language of my people, amazon would never publish my review so I‚Äôll settle for trying to express myself without using any foul language.These things are (expletive typically used to describe fornication however also used to express strong feeling or excitement; in this case excitement) AMAZING! I loved my old headphones and recommend them to everyone, but they are absolute (excrement) compared to these beautiful (male children of female canines) the sound quality not just when listening but also on calls is (fornicating) incredible! The ambient sound feature is really what sets these apart, I‚Äôve never had that in a headphone and I love it! When listening to music, you can block out all other sounds but when the music is off, even with the headphones still in you can hear the clunk of ant (excrement) from across the room!

"I skipped the first generation Galaxy Buds but was most impressed by the battery life and external audio pass-through on the Plus model compared to my previous set of wireless earbuds. Audio quality is nothing to write home about but nothing to complain about either out for the price, that being said slapping the AKG branding on these doesn't do much. Wireless charging case is nice and the C type port moves me one step further to ditching my last micro USB cables.My one real complaint is how useless the touch controls are, they are both overly sensitive and difficult to use properly. Samsung's app does give you the option of ""locking"" the functions but this does not disable the volume controls which are located at the top of each earbud. This is a problem as errant brushes on your hand(such as when adjusting the straps of a mask in this era) can cause you to accidentally change the volume but worse is when running where the jostling of the buds causes the top of one's ear to come in contact and raise or lower the volume randomly.",4,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0

The only thing I can think of that some people may not like about these is that it's near impossible to hear the outside world when you have them in. That can be good or bad though. If you don't want ambient noise (like on a plane), it's nice. But if you're say, bicycling, I suggest only putting one in to hear traffic.

"I did all my due diligence researching wireless headsets. I needed a set for all my business shifting to video/call conferencing. I don't like Apple products, nor did I want to spend $250+. Lots of online vids and written reviews said these had the better mics (vs pixelbuds, jabras) . So I bought these when they came out, advertised as having multiple mics on each earbud and having great microphone quality. I don't know what happened, but now they are unusable for all calls. This is why I hate buying brand new tech, there are always issues that are lied about in the launch advertising. Search for ""buds plus microphone problems"" and you'll see what I'm talking about.The product information section from Samsung says: ""Your voice, loud and clear. Ensure you‚Äôre heard clearly. A dedicated internal and two external microphones pick up your voice and isolate it from outside noises. When you‚Äôre on a call, your voice comes through richly and confidently, even in noisy locations."" THIS IS JUST NOT TRUE!!!",1,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"Bought these based on a positive review and am totally disappointed. They sound as tinny as the free wired earbuds my credit union gave away a couple of years ago. Yes, they stay in my ears better than my MUCH better-sounding Airpods, and the sound they produce is very clear, bur if you like a solid bass sound these will not make you happy. I've tried using the equalizer settings in the phone app, and changing the size of the rubber tips, but I can find no way to make a discernible difference in the bass-free sound. Buy them only if you don't care whether you can hear the lower end of the sound spectrum.UPDATE: Apparently I have larger-than-average ear canals; none of the cusions supplied made a tight enough fit, but I was able to find a set of cushions even larger than the largest ones that came with these, and that made an astounding difference. They now sound at least as good as my Airpods Pro, and still stay put in my ears. So I withdraw the previous comment; I knew that getting the right fit was essential, and now that I have it, these sound terrific. My previous ""1"" rating is now a ""5"".",5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
Received the unit and it was timely. I set up the app to control the bass/treble. For the price the Buds were clear but there was a lot of treble.

Then my eardrums where almost Blown Away with high quality Sound and Bass. First wireless earbuds where I will decline to turn the volume all the way up. YouTube videos do not Give them Justice. Ambient sound improves your hearing better than your normal hearing Considering that the Ambient sound is volume control at three levels. I love hearing my own voice Amplified as I'm singing along with my music. Samsung must have done this purposely. I can also listen to my earphones on Bluetooth and the music on another Bluetooth device such as my car or my JBL Charge 4. And must I add again that they do not slip out of my ears and at one point I could not even feel them in there standing still. However like almost all ear phones that are not memory foam do have pressure points in your ear Exhausted from wearing them for long periods of time.,5,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"Gave these headphones a try now TWICE.  Both times there were major problems with the left earbud.  The first time it wouldn't connect at all.  I sent them back one day after getting them and got a replacement pair sent.  2nd pair came and worked for one day.  After that, the left one started not working again.  It would connect just fine but the sound would cut in and out with no rhyme or reason.  Very disappointed considering how expensive these are.  I've only bought $30-40 pairs of wireless buds before now and they all worked better than these.  These also didn't have great noise cancellation for what's supposedly a name brand superior product.  My no name headphones do a better job.  Also, these hurt my ears after wearing for about an hour.  Overall just very disappointed.  This was the first pair of what I would consider expensive headphones I have bought and at this point I can't figure out how they have gotten so many good reviews.  It can't be a coincidence that I had the same problem twice.  It is a defect.  Going to go back to my cheap headphones.",1,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"These are amazing! We've now bought 2 since I liked them so much, I got an extra pair for my husband. They fit very well, and don't hurt my ears with continuous wear. They have great sound quality and the battery life is amazing. I also like that they are small and aren't super obvious when you're wearing them. Great for listening to music, talking on the phone, or just watching videos. I would highly recommend these regardless of if you have an iphone or android. The app is easy to use and these are such a great value compared to other similar ear buds that are available on the market.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
"I don't know about you but I thought I am done trying the airbuds. Except the iPhone related models which I never bothered trying (I am not a fan of iPhone), I tried too many different airbuds and I returned everyone of them until this one. This is the airbud I was always dreaming about and I really can't emphasize my happiness when I started testing it on everything I ever had plan to use these airbuds for. Even the single use like when you choose the wear only one at the time. The level of comfort, the compatibility to function on my Samsung Note, the sound quality, the volume range, the look .... I am happy to the point that it's rare for me to experience. Even the shipment was fast,like I got the item about 15 hours after ordering on Amazon app. I didn't even have to change the parts with smaller or bigger size since the one inside the box was already the best fit for my ears. I really can't ask for anything more. If you are an Android user and specially Samsung phones, consider giving it a try.",5,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
I was not sure that I was going to like earbuds that just hung on my ear and I didn't. I have been using Wireless earbuds that have a wire between the two earbuds and that works better for me. I did buy a strap so that I would not I have to have these stuck in my ear all the time and I could hang them over my neck like my earlier pairs .I found these to be clunky. Every time I had to move them in my ear I would do something to either change my phone or something. I did not find them easy to use at all.,2,1,2020-4-1,1,1,0
"I know with Bluetooth you can always expect a degraded sound compared to hard wired headphones, but these were worse than normal.  There's a persistent low-volume hiss, and all highs sound shrill with a hint of distortion.  I ran them for 10 hours, just in case there was any break-in difference, but none was heard.  Features are great, they pair really easy (Galaxy S8 and S20) and the ambient function is excellent and impressive.  But, headphones at this price should sound better.  The fit was OK, but I expected them to be more stable in the ear, as they felt like they were always going to fall out, no matter the tip size.  Returned.",3,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
"I just received these yesterday.  First of all shipping was amazingly FAST!  I wasn't expecting to receive these until today.  They are very easy to connect and when fitted into ear properly they sound amazing!  The bass is incredible.  When I have them in, no one else can hear what I am listening to either.  They stay put nicely.  I will be able to walk and exercise with these in which is one of the main reasons that i purchased them.  I get up at 4 am to exercise and the rest of my house is still sleeping.  I wasn't able to listen to music while exercising before for fear of waking everyone up.  I am very happy with this purchase all around!",5,1,2020-4-3,1,1,0
"Like the previous almost identical version, these have the little backwards ring in addition to the ear insert in two other sizes - I use the largest.

"Sound quality is average and disappointing considering they're made by Samsung. They're overpriced for the quality and definitely not loud enough. I feel like I'm wearing kid's earbuds with a sound governor. The noise cancelation, though it isn't listed as an active feature, does in fact work very well. With 8 kids my house can get extremely noisy. With these in I literally can't hear a damn thing! The only reason I can't give these 5 stars is because the left earbud was wisper quiet right out of the box. No amount of setting changes on either my phone's sound or the Galaxy Wearable app solved the issue. I ended up returning them and buying the new bean shaped Galaxy Buds Live, which are awesome, but definitely a personal preference as to the way they're wornThey don't actually go inside the ear canal and can make the cartilage above sore after a while.",3,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"I love most everything about these with the exception of the bass being a bit weak compared to my Phaser Fusion One buds, and it could be a bit louder. However, there is a significant problem with the buds not charging when placed into the case with the tips installed. This is true even for the silicone tips that come with these buds, and don't even think about trying it with memory foam tips. Before anybody brings it up, YES, I am placing the buds in the correct spots n the charging case (left bud in left spot, right bud in right spot). When placing the buds in the case with the tips on, the charging light doesn't come on, and the lid won't close without a little extra nudge...and then won't stay completely closed without holding them shut. Sometimes you can see the charging light come on as the lid is sliding over the top of the buds and pushing them down far enough for the charging points on the buds and charger case to connect, but apparently the don't stay connected once the lid is fully closed. And, since the connection is lost once the lid is closed, you won't know that they haven't charged until you open the lid and the app shows the same charge (or slightly lower) as they did when you put them in...even after several hours. Without the tips installed, the connection and charging works flawlessly. Fortunately, the awesome battery life of these allows me to listen to these all day at work with 30-40% left at the end of the day (9 hour days Mon-Thur and 4 hours on Friday). Again, most everything about these buds are great, which is why I will probably keep them and may even consider buying them again in the future.PS: Has anyone else had this same issue, and if so, have you figured out how to make them charge without uninstalling the tips first?",4,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
+ Great battery life. I can go days without charging this.+ One of the few earbuds I can find that can tolerate (and charge off of) the same USB-C power supply I use for laptops and my cell phone. (Trying to convert the entire household's devices to one type of power supply!),2,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0
The Galaxy Buds+ exceeded my expectations as an upgrade from the model released last year. There is little change in the appearance of the devices but the battery life improvement alone is worth considering a purchase of the Buds+. Nearly doubling from 6 to 11 hours of life without a noticeable change in the size of the buds is a feat and the somewhat small change to display the battery capacity of the case along with the buds in the app is an important improvement.Call quality is also greatly improved on the Buds+ and I was already happy with the original set.,5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
Ok so I just ordered the Apple air pods pro for my birthday 7/11/20 two days later I was back on the market looking for a new set of Bluetooth earphones my original set was the Samsung icon x 1st gen but I couldn‚Äôt use the Samsung app so I really couldn‚Äôt get all the benefits unless I upgraded which I just did. I must say I was in love as soon as I opened the package. Idk if it‚Äôs the color that got me or the size which is smaller then the 1st gen or the combination. They fit perfect just like my old ones they sound great too. Now I have ambient sound I no longer have to pause or take out my earphones the only thing I miss is hey Siri but then again my pros didn‚Äôt do a good job picking up my voice anyways lol but I can still manually touch to ask For assistance. So the pros and Samsung buds sound clear But I love the option of changing the equalizer on the buds. ambient sound is ok but I‚Äôd have to give that to the Apple pros plus the noise cancellation. So if you‚Äôre a Apple user like me looking for a alternative to the Apple earphones These are great for the buck battery life Is by far more better then 4.5 hrs you get with Apple. They Also don‚Äôt fall out or push out your ear. I definitely feel like I can work out in these,5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,1
If you're on the fence about buying these...jump. I did research for months trying to decide between the buds and the buds+. I tried the music quality first and the sound was amazing. The app makes it so you can choose your perfect sound.Next the CALL QUALITY is the best I've ever had on wireless earphones. I am always disappointed but with these I could hear my call clearly and I didn't have to yell for the person on the other end to hear me. I could use my regular inside voice and I talk pretty low.,5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"I've had them for a week and I'm thrilled with how they sound! Battery life is excellent, I've only made a few calls but the sound quality is great and the fit and feel in ear is solid.Music wise, vs the only other ear buds I've had which were Amazon recommend 50.00 ones, it's not even comparable. The base is is quite present with out causing any distortion or lack of quality of mid and high ranges.",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,1
"The Apple-style buds did not stay in my ears, so I wanted something that would, with good sound, and reasonably discreet. The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ met all those criteria. They stay in, even while exercising, sound clear, shut out the outside noises really well, and look pretty good -- it's actually nice to have something different that the ""cigarette-in-the-ear"" look of the Apple devices. Complaints: The bass is very underwhelming, even with ""bass boost"" mode turned on (bass boost is really more of a ""treble suppress"" mode). Also, there's a mode that lets in ambient sounds (to allow easier talking to others, for example); however, that mode amplifies and distorts the outside sounds too much, and is very annoying -- I tried it a couple times, and haven't used it since.Overall, great purchase. (And they only cost a little over half the price of the Apple buds!)",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
"Love them, except for some close-range connectivity issues. Not sure if this problem is specific to me or not or has something to do with nearby Bluetooth and wireless devices (like wireless routers). I regret not getting the insurance on these guys.The fit is great even with my sensitive ears. And with the extra fittings it's easy to get a customized fit. The sound quality is better than I expected and call quality is excellent. We can hear each other perfectly clear. I love the ambient sound mode; I can listen to music at work (kinda loud) and still hear things around me, especially when you activate the labs feature and turn on the extra high ambient sound. Things sound a little tinny but it's no bother, really. I like the app, as you can play around with the settings and even find your earbuds. I will definitely be looking forward to future versions of them",4,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0
"I purchased these ear buds to replace a pair I lost. I have a Samsung phone so thought this would be a great options. The ear buds are very light and the pairing process was very easy. I did feel like they didn't fit to my ear great, but this may have been resolved if I changed the size of the rubber earbuds. The reason I returned the earbuds is that the sound quality was not very good. When I was talking on the phone the sound of the person on the the other line would get softer and louder randomly. This was really frustrating and I felt that for the price of the ear buds this shouldn't be happening. I would not recommend these is you will be using them for phone calls, which is what I was looking to do.",2,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
"Maybe I was being too optimistic buying these, but the digital artifacts when playing music are EXTREMELY BAD.Little high pitched tinny distortion noises coming through (and that's when streaming at the highest quality setting - I've compared it to my other speakers and wired earbuds which do not have this problem).",1,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"Overall the sound quality is good, I give this a solid 4 starts for the tech and sound.  However it gets a 1 star for fit (averaged to 2 stars).  I bought these to wear out at the stable while taking care of our horses.  I have tried all combinations of the rubber earpieces trying to make it so these don't fall out of my ear with no success.  I've already had several cases where one of the buds falls out in the stall with the horse nearly stepping on it.  These will likely work fine as long as you use them in your car, home or office, anything where not a lot of movement is involved, I would expect taking a walk would be OK too.  Actives like yard work or anything involving bending over or a moderate amount of activity may cause you trouble.

"I am thoroughly enjoying the purchase of my Samsung Galaxy Buds + wireless ear buds. I have purchased numerous wireless ear buds from different manufacturers and these are by far the most comfortable ones that I have purchased. They are light weight, sound great and most of all I can wear them continuously without bothering my ears or making my ears feel itchy inside.These buds have a lot of different features that I have yet to explore, but out of the box, they were easy to set up on my Samsung Note 8, and all of the features explained in the quick start guide worked just like the instructions said. I also noted that after using them continuously for 6 hours, when I put them back in the case, the battery indicator in the app showed that I had 60% of the battery still available.",5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0

"One thing I've always loved about my OG Galaxy Buds was the sound, so when I read about how these sounded even better, I was super excited.  But when I put them in, and threw a song on, I was left puzzled.  Something didn't sound right, so I made sure the software was up to date, restarted my phone, and tried out the different equalizer settings in the wearable app, but nothing could get rid of the more distorted and tinny sound that these had.  It's exactly like listening to a 256kbps mp3 vs a 128kbps. There's just that little bit more of distortion that good listeners and gear heads are gonna notice. And I think this is how they're getting better battery life out of these--using a lower bitrate DAC.I even ended up buying another pair because I thought maybe I got some duds (not buds), but those sounded the same, as well.  I'm sure many people wouldn't notice and the increased battery life may be more important to them, but I'm returning these and sticking to my clean and clear sounding OG Galaxy Buds.",3,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"These are my first set of this type of ear buds. The sound quality is very good, so long as the buds are in correctly and that can take some finagling to get them just right. Everyone's ears are a little different, so it might not be as much of an issue with others as it is for me. I have to really push and twist these around to get a good seal. Once set, they seem to stay put. I wish they had a way to adjust the bass to and individuals preference rather than the presets, but dynamic sounds pretty good to me, especially with Amazon's HQ and Ultra HQ songs. Build quality seems really good and they are reasonably comfortable at least for the short time I have had them. One other thing, Don't Lose the Charging base. I see they cannot be replaced and you will have to buy a whole new set of buds. I bought a zippered fob key case with a snap hook on it to keep mine in. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend them.",4,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"Sooooo extremely dissatisfied that these can only connect with one device at a time. I was actually replacing earbuds that cost less than half this amount. THOSE could connect quickly to multiple devices, but I was looking for a little better battery life. With these Samsung Buds+, while the sound is great, I realized after multiple attempts to connect to phone and laptop, that it just doesn't happen. Apparently they can only connect to a single device. Attempting to connect to a second device will automatically disconnect them from the first. What a FAIL! Unless my husband has a need for them they will need to be returned, as I need a pair that will connect to my laptop or computer while still staying connected to my phone.",3,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0

No pain even after prolonged wear.  They come with 2 different ear tips so if one doesn't work for you the other likely will.  They are very secure with the ear tips on.  Worst case scenario if both ear tips hurt you then you can remove them.  They won't be as secure for running or other activities without the tips but for most things they are just fine without them as they have a good suction in the ear canal.As for sound, great on calls and music.

They can be worn all day without discomfort, they stay in my ears pretty well during vigorous workouts, sound quality is great, call quality is great, aesthetics and button control on side is great.  My only complaint would be lack of active noise canceling, but because they seal sound out so well, I don't really see the need for it - it blocks ambient sound just as good as the leading ANC earbuds (apple and sony).

The sound is extremely accurate on the base setting, and dynamic adds the bass you need for metal and rap. The battery life feels like it lasts 3x longer than my old buds! About 7 hours per bud full volume for my use case, and close to 12 hours with lower volume and ambient sound turned off (another useful feature to hear your surroundings.)

My absolute favorite feature of these is the ability to hear sounds around you if you turn on ambient sounds. There's no perceivable delay, and at the medium setting, I can hear almost as well as my regular hearing. It's nice to pause my music with one tap, and carry on a conversation without taking out a bud.

With all the above items, they just aren't a workable product unless you are sitting stationary in a quiet environment. Then they may work well.

"I bought the original buds when they came out and I like them and still use them. On a whim I saw the new ones in red so bought myself a new set of the Buds +.First off the red is sick.. It's not just flat red, it's metallic red.. pretty snazzy. Paired easy to both my Note 9 and my iPhone XS Max with no problems..  upon initial set up with my note, there was a software update. Which was simple and straight forward.",5,1,2020-3-17,1,0,1
"Each update they get better and better....sound quality is pretty good, but there's other buds which sound a little better.  Pretty comfortable, worn't fall out of ears while working out.  Control virtually everything via touch.Only complaint is if you have a jaw that clicks, and you have the touch volume controls enabled, it can possibly raise or lower the volume if you're eating.  Bizarre side effect, but worth noting.",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"They're great at music. If you play around with the settings you can get some great bass out of them. Music is great on both Android and iPhone. On iPhone weirdly, both pieces of the headset show up individually when you try to pair.The call quality is great and people can hear me just fine. On iPhone you must have both headphones set to connect in the blue tooth section for them to work. Apple make everything complicated. Lastly the touch feature is weird to use but after some practice it almost feel natural.",5,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0

"I've had them for a week and have been using them for both my computer and my S20+ without any problems until today.  I put them in my ears and the left one doesn't work.  Looking at the wearable app, the right battery is at 100% and the left is at 0.  I put them both back in the case on a charger for a couple of hours, no change.  The charging light does light up when I place only the left one in the case, so either the case is bad or the left one is bad.Contacted Amazon, they tried troubleshooting steps, then instructed me to contact Samsung.

"So far, these earbuds fit the best in my ears. I can use these in most exercises without worrying about them falling out.Now when it comes to audio quality and ambient sound amplification, these fall a little short. The audio just doesn't seem as clear and crisp as my Sony WF-1000XM3s.

These buds come with different sized fittings for your ears, you can receive telephone calls with them, the carrying case serves as a charger, sound is high quality and can be adjusted, and you can change tracks by tapping the buds.  I‚Äôm sure I missed something but I recommend these to anyone looking for great sound and some built in safety.",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
I got tired of the wires. These sound great (not awesome but still great) and have quite a few nice features. I needed to use the smallest ear pieces. I've found dynamic with a customized equilizer created best overall sound quality. The ambient sound option is a major benefit.One of my buds dropped sound to a very low level after I dropped it. I called Samsung support. They answered quickly. I told them what happened. They created a return ticket for free shipping. I sent them in . . . they sent them back fully repaired. Cost me nothing. This is a home run of support and service. So happy and impressed with Samsung support.,5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"I just got it today so I have to see if I still like them after using them for awhile. But so far they are so comfy, cute, and good sound. I was afraid it wouldn't be loud enough but I put it on Dynamic setting and that was best for me. I paid more for the cloud blue color and glad I did. It's so shiny and looks sweet in my ears.

"ok so I'm a diehard samsung fan and what the hell are these? Really samsung f-you. Ok first they dont fit in your ears at all, I tries all the tips and its inconceivable that they fit anyone. 2.) The sound quality it garbage, it sounds like your watching TV in a tile bathroom. I downloaded 6 different apps for equalizers and 0 improved the crap sound. Then again you can't fix tmwhats not their. 3.) The design is not good the ""wing tips"" don't grasp or slide under any part of your ear so they kinda just hang out loose and not locked in if you get my meaning.and 4.) Their are alot better choices out there for 145-150 dollars, spend your money on Sony or hell senheiser buds which I hear are amazing.",2,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0

Paired with a Samsung Galaxy S10 easily but the audio quality was poor. The equalizer that is featured in the Wearable app did not change the equalizer settings regardless of which preset was chosen. The earbuds paired easily with Windows 10 but no controls on the earbuds work nor would the input and output devices work simultaneously. If you want to simply listen to music wirelessly then there are earbuds available that will do a far better job. If you want earbuds to make calls do not use these as it does not come through clear even within a small quiet room. This product is not worth the price being asked for it.,1,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"I bought these so I can exercise outside. Most earbuds block sound out completely, and if you like that, more power to you. But when I'm outside, I want to be able to hear what is going on around me, and these do that spectacularly well (via the Galaxy Wear app)(I use an S10+ but I don't know how well the app works on other phones or non-Samsung phones). Also, when I'm on phone calls, I like that I can hear my own voice vs sounding like I'm covering my ears. The mic quality for is also really good, much better than the mic on the phone, in my opinion.I haven't really pushed the battery life since I only use them a couple of hours at a time.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"These connected just fine most of the time for a while. But the app is a major pain in the butt. It has to open every time I use these, battery suck. It always needs to update, the most recent one is causing them to disconnect a lot - and I have to find the case to reconnect at all on my phone. Funny, this is not an issue on my computer where the app isn't needed. It disconnects the headphones to update. Which means you have to find the case to have it open to reconnect when updating. If this were very occasional that would be fine, but I have had to update a bunch of time in a few months. Annoying. I cannot find a headphone, it will not connect to my phone to make use of the 'find my headphone feature' because post update they connect and disconnect a lot (so now I am SOL unless I find it myself). Useless feature there. The security of having to sign off access to basically all of my phone accesses for a darn headphone is sketchy as all getout. They stay in my ears while running. Sound-wise they are good, but I bet there is an equivalent headphone with lot less of the headache.",3,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"I've been a fan of Bluetooth headphones since 2006 when the only ones available made you look like Princess Leia, and eventually got more discreet like the S9 and S10 from Motorola, but always wanted them to evolve to two buds like the Galaxy Buds.  After almost two years of use of the original buds, I upgraded to the Galaxy Buds plus and I'm loving them.  Better battery life, but I really love the ambient sound feature.  I actually use it and it works  (The original buds ambient sound made everything sound robotic.)  With the original buds I had to take one out to hear outside noise, because in ear headsets are like ear plugs.  Now I get the best of both worlds.I'm aware there is a third generation of galaxy buds live, but those our outer ear buds, and I prefer in ear buds.  I may get a spare of these galaxy buds plus to use a few years from now.  I'm worried they won't make good in ear ear buds like this again.",5,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
They are very nice earphones and have a good long lasting battery. Quality of sound is acceptable but not o par with the better ones like Jabra abd Beats. My main problem with them was that I couldn't pair them with my daily driver Oneplus7T. I tried and tried and tired... but no luck even after I unpaired them several times and reinstall Galaxy Wear app. They worked just fine with my other phone Note 10 + though. So I have to return them as I planned to use them with both of my phones and stay with the cheap ones I bought earlier from Amazon. They had no problem pairing with any phones in my household,3,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0

So I did... and a week later, I get an email that my repair has ""been placed on hold due to an unvailable part.""

"I was perfectly happy with my original Galaxy Buds. For about a year they were my faithful companions, which is why when Samsung introduced the Galaxy Buds+ I was originally thinking I would pass. I watched a few reviews on YouTube and my ears started to perk up.Last week I decided to buy them and WOW! what a difference they make. Call quality, in even the most challenging environments is significantly improved. This alone is worth the upgrade, in my opinion.

"They pair easily with my Galaxy S9 and utilize the Wear app. That's the good news. But sound quality: horrible. Sounds like everything is being transmitted from the inside of an aluminium garbage can. Buds are reasonably fine for about an hour.

"When I first bought these, they worked ok with my Garmin Fenix 6 - certainly better than other brands I've tried. That was once I figured out you have to wear the watch on the right hand to not have the sound skip every few seconds. Then I hooked the buds up to my Samsung phone, and a bunch of updates came down, which provided a couple of nice new features. However, after those updates, I can't listen to music without the sound skipping and chopping up every 10 seconds. It doesn't matter which hand I use the watch, these buds are now horrible to use.",2,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
Awesome. I have the first set of earbuds that Samsung released. Those had a problem where I would pull them out at the gym and the battery would be dead. It would just drain from the case. These do not have that problem. They can sit in my bag for weeks and still be ready to go. The software is updated regularly. They stay in. The controls are sensitive enough to know when it is in my ear and when it isn't. They are comfrotable. I Don't have anything bad to say about them. I have not run the battery down while using them working out and haven't had an issue with sweat.,5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"I am absolutely impressed with these earbuds. My favorite things about them are the first factor...I totally forget they are there, even with a winter hat on over them, super light and fit perfectly in my ear. I am also really impressed with the ambient noise feature. Perfect for better having to take these out to interact with anyone I need to. And finally, the battery life is crazy awesome. The sound quality is good, not as much base as I would like (even on the dynamic preset), but I'm using these as my daily commuter/work set and don't really need it.",5,1,2020-3-5,1,1,0
"The sound is the same quality as a cheap pair of earbuds. There's also no noise cancellation which to be fair I wasn't really expecting. People seemed to be reviewing the sound quality high, however, for the price it's completely not worth it but the concept itself is cool.To note to anyone with the same issue: I also have extremely small ears with smaller ear canals. While I read articles saying they would stay I did not feel like trying to run with these litterally hanging out of my ears and looking like a complete fool. For the price and the sound quality it's completely not worth it. I returned these immediately or, at the least, am attempting to considering apparently even Amazon lockers aren't available despite them saying so. I completely regret buying these, however, I was initially very excited.",1,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0

Huh, who loses their earbuds with the box open, you are more likely to put them down somewhere without the box which is what he has done a couple of times, especially as he usually uses just one.

People say they can hear me on calls just fine. Again, not as good as a dedicated voice headset, but that's not what I was expecting. The one true disappointment is ""ambient"" mode, where it lets in sound from your environment.  Ambient mode is terrible.  To notice any difference you have to turn the ambient volume all the way up, and even then it's spotty and the pass-through quality is bad. Lots of headphones or even ear protection have ambient pass through. It's old tech that should be easy enough to execute on.  They missed the boat on that feature and it cost them 1 star.

They cut out constantly even though my phone is right on my desk, they also like to randomly disconnect.  Controls work when they want to and they do not stop playing when you take the bus out.

I have had no complaints. The soud of music could be better but that is not the purpose of me having them. I am also comparing them to the sanhizer and klipsch that i had.

My only knock would be that buds don't power off when removed and it's nearly impossible to reposition or remove one without changing tracks or pausing your song due to the touch sensitive side panels. Not a deal breaker by any means. Also wish it could go just a little louder.  They get loud don't get me wrong,but I always try to go just a little higher and I am already maxed out.

I have been through a few sets of ear buds and these are my favorites. I didn't think the true wireless were a good choice for chance of losing one. However I was surprised how well they fit and hold in my ear. Been using them for about a month in all kinds of environments and they hold tight but comfortably. The sound is good and better if you have them really tight in your ear. The bass is a little lacking at times but over all these are really high quality. The charging case is a real bonus.

"It snugged comfortable in the ears especially when u have extra ear tips to fit any size ears. touch seems sensitive and responsive Except for the volume up and down.

The ambient sound control is something is amazing, I enjoy controlling my background noise whenever I want. Can't go wrong with these headphones.",4,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"I've tried cheaper truly wireless buds, but there were regular signal fallouts, especially at the gym where large metal frames could surround me.  Since I started decided to guy better quality and started using these, I have not had one signal drop anywhere, even at the gym which has a weak Wi-Fi signal.  Sound quality is good to excellent.  They fit comfortably but I wish they had a little better instruction/tutorial on how to fit them to your ear.  I would recommend them to any skeptic.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"I received a set of these galaxy buds(NEW); upon arrival, I discovered that the right bud is inoperative. Ordered replacement set, the left bud is inoperative. Attempted to request another replacement but had to talk to an ""expert"" from Amazon. The expert had me troubleshoot(everything I already tried). The expert connected me to Samsung tech support; confirmed I received faulty earbuds and I could send them in to be repaired. I ordered new earbuds, that would be a refurbished set I asked if there was any way to connect the two working buds and he said only a Samsung service center could do this. If I wanted a refurbished set, I would've chosen refurbished for $30 less... very annoying. I finally convinced Amazon to send another replacement. Hopefully this set works....",1,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"Is it really worth 150? Only if you are using a Samsung phone. It gets the job done and is all around for everyday use. Not much to say about it. Portable and good for all situations. The case is glossy so it is prone to scratches.  I have one fat scratch on the case. No big deal though. If you have the original, don't bother to upgrade. There is only a significant difference.",5,1,2020-3-13,1,1,0
I ordered these last week cause I wanted buds with active noise cancellation.  They felt great right out of the box.  Very comfortable and great battery life is about all that is good about these.  However they sounded awful.  Very tinny and low sound even after the firmware upgrade and messing with the lousy EQ.  No matter how I tried the sound was just bad.  Also when you touch them to adjust them sometimes it cuts out the music.  Please save yourself the disappointment and buy the Jabra 75Ts.,2,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0
"Mine died/became completely non-responsive after less than six months of very light use.  I'm endeavoring to get warranty information and/or assistance from Amazon, but so far no response at all from Amazon.  Samsung's customer service has been non-existent.  I paid $150.00 on 3/22/2020 for these from Amazon (delivered on 3/25/2020), only to need to replace them after less than half a year.  No thank you, these are pure garbage.",1,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"First I have to say that I really wanted to like these headphones.  Waited for a while to pull the trigger, and when I finally did, I was disappointed with the design.  Definitely not made for small ears. I could not get a good seal even by changing the tips or the added wingtips. In the end the design sits in your ear and pushes against it in an uncomfortable way if your ear canals are not big enough. Returned these in the meantime. Still searching for the right design for small ears.",4,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"The connectivity wasn't great.  If I go 2 feet but separated by a door it breaks.I loved the design and the color (red) but that's about it.  I love Samsung brand as I've had the Samsung phones, tablets so I wanted these.",3,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"From what i can say the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Plus, are just decent... that's really it.I'm not really into it, its way too over priced, $140.99 is too much. It feels and sound like a $50 earbuds.",2,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"So far I am really happy that I upgraded to the buds+.  Ive had the buds for a year now, but like many didnt care for the call quality and the ambient sounds was soso.  So with this, the call quality is MILES better and the ambient noise is really REALLY nice this time around.  It sounds way better and louder than before.  To me, the sound quality is about the same as before.  The battery life is nice, but 6hrs was plenty for me.  Id say if you dont care about phone quality, I would say stay with the originals.  If you do make calls, but yes upgrade - its worth it.",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"I'm a fan of Samsung products, but I found these disappointing. The sound is good and it has nice features, but they just don't stay in the ears well. Add to that the touch (rather than press button) controls, and you're constantly pushing them back in your ears, and that registers as pausing play. I've tried jabras, raycons, and these, and, and these are my least favorite. The raycons don't have as nice of features, but overall fit the best and therefore are my favorites.",2,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
Out of the box the fit was perfect. They come with different sizes but I didn't need to change. The battery last all night. Fast charging and a nice small case. Works with Samsung Wearable app which allows control of the buds sound like bass and other types. Shows battery status of buds and case and software updates.These are so much better then Bose Free SoundSport (bad fit and battery life) and Echo Buds (bad fit and battery). I wish I could return both but I waited too long.,5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
I've had these a week now and I'm not really impressed. I've tried messing with the sound settings and different situations but not sure these are for me. My $25 fakebudz sound better and the only thing I like about these is it's small and you can hear phone calls.***UPDATE***,5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,1
"WOW! The sound is so awesome and the price is great. The Ambient sound is amazing - you can listen to music but hear someone talking clearly without pulling them out. The Ambient sound can be on or off. Even though people are saying these don‚Äôt technically have sound cancellation - when Ambient is off you cant hear outside noise especially when music is on because they set comfortably down in your ears. With the silicone band they feel firm in your ears, I don‚Äôt worry about them falling out. Great fit!",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"For Starters, WOW! 1.Bluetooth range, AWESOME! I waked all the way into my garage and shut the door and the bluetooth connection didn't crack. This is AWESOME! 2. Sound. Another Awesome improvement.

"Bought these for hubby for Father's Day. He like to walk early morning and was trying to listen to his financial program while walking, but had trouble competing with surrounding noise. He charged these up and was ready for next day. He is one happy camper.

"I had to return and get a new set due to the first set not charging the left bud. Once the replacement came the item worked properly and sound was great. I like that the case is the charger and the design of the item. The buds fit well in the ear and do not fall out. I do worry of sync/charge issues as I continue to see others with charging/sync issues with time. Given I had a charge issue with my first order, I am concerned it will eventually happen with this new pair.",3,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"Bought these since I watched tons of reviews. Previously purchased the Jabra Elite Actives and those sound incredible and are super comfortable however they have an issue where the bluetooth cuts out whenever you bend at the waste. Jabra claims this is normal. I will have to live with it. The Buds plus have message annunciation which is so convenient but the sound quality is not incredible, not bad but can't hold a candle to the Jabras.",4,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
New galaxy s20+came with the first galaxy buds and I loved them lots but my daughter actually loved them more with her iPhone so I made this my excuse to buy the buds+ and I am so glad I did. After a couple of adjustments they fit perfect and sound so good. The ability to make sounds outside the buds is great if you are like me and use them on downtime at work so I don't need to keep taking them out. Even better note is that they are cheaper than air pods if you are an apple user.,5,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0
"I travel alot and needed a useful alternative to a boom headset for when I go in meetings and such. These worked wonderfully at first, but now the right ear bud has gone out almost completely.  You can barely hear any music even at full volume. I have tried everything but unfortunately I am down to the left only which I rarely use. They are great for 3 or 4 months, but continuous use they are not good for. Honestly save yourself the money and find much cheaper alternatives because even if they go out after 6 months it is cheaper than having to replace these.",1,1,2020-8-28,1,0,1
I used to use the around the neck headsets and they worked great for audio but also phone calls. I use them a LOT for phone calls when shopping or out of the house. I was going through a lot of the around the neck headsets and wanted to replace them with earbuds instead. I tried a knock off Amazon find and the sound was great but the mic was horrible. So I got these & I am soooo happy with the quality!,5,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
"A big waste of money. These worked fine for about three months. One ear bud stopped working so we sent it in for repair. We were told there was significant impact damage to the ear bud and it would cost $100 to repair. These were only used with normal wear, no impact ever happened. Not to mention they cost $150.... I'm no longer a Samsung ear bud customer after this experience. Don't waste your money.",1,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0

I bought these for my wife because I had a pair and I love them.  I like the ability to choose different degrees of  noise cancellation .  sound quality is superb for earbuds.  they take some getting used to physically as the ear canal can get irritated at first if I wear them too much. but I gradually get used to it.

I was thinking about getting apple airpods 2 pro but for the price tag of $250? No. I went with these. They don't have active voice cancelation, but the nice seal it has around the ears makes up for that. They are super customizable. Being able to turn ambient noise on and off with the push of a button is amazing. When I use the forklift at work I can turn ambient noise on and hear everything around me with amazing clarity.

These are quite neutral in signature with a slight bump in low end and when using samsung scalable codec (samsung only devices) they sound amazing for $150.  $150 for a wired version would be a great deal, but BT 5.0, spotify integration and a bunch of other bells & whistles make them a steal.

"I don't normally write reviews however this was worth it. I was worried that I was spending too much since they offer a cheaper model, but I am telling you, you won't regret it!

My main concern is comfort and above all else that my wife doesn't complain about having trouble hearing me when talking on the phone using the earbuds.  This is the first pair that I have had no complaints about.  People can hear me fine while in the car driving 80Mph, while in a noisy office, in a hotel room standing near a noisy air conditioner, and walking to the car on a windy day.  My only complaint is that i wish they had a vent to reduce pressure in my ear and allow noise through without hardware/software magic.  Without the vent they are still the most comfortable earbuds I have ever owned.",5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
"The only reason I take a star from these is the IPX rating should be at least 5 but other than that damn near perfect. Good sound stage. App works well.

"So far so good, these Samsunh galaxy  buds + are amazing. I myself have the Galaxy S10. Some reviews say the buds don't have any bass. But you definitely can control that option on the wearable app. So with that being said, the bass is great. I work as a carrier and listen to music all day while I work. Only use one bud at a time during work, 8 hrs in and my right ear bud still didn't need charging. So battery life is great. Sound quality was on point and clear. Can't really say about noise cancelation yet, but will revise if I experience that.",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"These are good in most respects.  they fit fine.  battery life is more than what i need. Sound quality is quite good. for noise reduction, the ear buds are more effective than actual ear plugs. The only real drawback is the volume.The low volume may protect your ears from damage, which i can appreciate after 25 years of blasting my ears, thing is though, the music i like to hear really does need to be played loud.  I dig metal of many stripes and volume is an important consideration. it is loud enough, barely but i wish i could get like, 25% louder. that would be about perfect.",4,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0

These do not have active noise canceling but they still do a good job of blocking outside noise. I couldn't ask for more out of these at this price point.",5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"These earbuds charge very quickly and have excellent sound quality.  Bought them for my wife and the size if perfect, since they're on the smaller side for wireless earbuds.

I loved these until I decided to wear them while laying in the sun.  One of them started beeping.  Then the other.  Turns out they were overheating.  Samsung said that while overheating is a known issue it is because of faulty buds. They also said that their buds overheating could be pretty dangerous.

"Works as expected. I had to use apps that offset the sound delay that is inherent in wireless earbuds without low latency codecs. For videos in android, that means using the youtube app instead of using the browser directly. Battery life is great.Touch controls are all on or all off.

It seems as if the connection is bad but the problem is solved when I out both in....kinda wired but that's the only complaint I have so far.

They have trouble staying connected laying on the table beside my phone. Major disappointment. Even when paired with my Note 10+. Firmware constantly updates with no help. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FROM A FEWLLOW Samsung-o-phile",2,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"I was excited to try these wireless buds due to all the positive reviews but once receiving them myself I was pretty disappointed. For the price the sound quality was mediocre and below average to what I was used to. The touch commands on the buds weren't intuitive. Worst part was that the buds weren't comfortable, especially laying down hurt me ears more than they should've. I love Samsung but they have yet to perfect the wireless earbuds, past generations and models were also disappointing unfortunately",2,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"Absolutely worth every penny, sound quality is great and the ambient noise setting is both versatile and useful. It really adds a whole new level of sound that borderline on asmr when your music is turned off. Microphone quality is excellent and the battery and recharge times are amazing.

Just all around great. I am not tangled up at work and bound by wires. I also love the feature hear far distances. In settings on the app and also the phone.It makes it clear and crisp. Both settings together makes it hear clear.",5,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0

"This is my second pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds.  My first pair was a promo with my new Galaxy Note 10+.  Both sets of my Samsung Galaxy earbuds matched up with both my phone and my iPad much easier and fit better than my Bose did.  My Bose earbuds were more difficult to deal with and bigger, and kept slipping out of my ears even with the smallest attachment.  Great job Samsung!!!",5,1,2020-3-29,1,0,0
"These are only ok. They didn‚Äôt fall out of my ears when I worked out but they would hurt my ears after 15-20 minutes. Sound was fine until you have any noise in the background, ie: tv on. I knew I would want to have these when I traveled on planes so this made my decision for returning them easy. I didn‚Äôt want to spend the extra money for the AirPods Pro but I bit the bullet and the sound quality is like night and day. I‚Äôm glad I paid the extra money.",3,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0

Im very happy with my purchase.",5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0

"Used to listen to music at work for 8 hours straight at least. Battery good for at least 10 hours, Be sure to utilize Sound Wizard if your phone has the option. I am using a Samsung S20+ 5G. It will make a difference for bass. Also, buds do not need to jammed/pushed into ear canal. I am using the Large Earbud Tips. They just need to sit comfortably in the ear and let the Earbud Tips seal out the sound. Has Ambient Mode for hearing external sounds with 3 levels. Best damn buds ever.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
Just like some people have said my right ear bud was dead but all it needed was to be charged. It was a simple fix. Just needed to give it an hour after put it on a charger and everything worked fine. People are way to impatient. You lift it out of the case and put it back in and it will start charging the buds. Other then that minor hiccup they seem to be real nice. I like the quality. I have no complaints at all.,3,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
Good earphones however they seem to disconnect a lot  don't kno.w if its a issue for others. The onboard storage is a game changer you literally don't need your phone with these at all,4,1,2020-6-1,1,1,0
The sound in these headphones is really good but it's not the best to use for company phone calls. If you are buying these headphones because they have 4 mics that are supposed to be better for phone calls then these are not for you but if you are buying these headphones to listen to music then these are great headphones with clear sound and strong bass.,4,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
These are absolutely amazing.  I've had them for a week now..and I was never the one to leave ear pieces in myy ear. I thought the idea was stupid and I was afraid that they would fall out.

"Would not recommend. Every few months I have to get a replacement because the volume in one ear drops way below the other and the only way to solve it is to send it back to Samsung for a new pair.

Although they seem good overall at first, this repeated issue means I would recommend trying something else.",1,1,2020-7-29,1,1,0

Unless having the latest or just the improved battery. I really do not see the price justified. The original buds are better in my opinion minus the amazing battery life the Buds + give the user.

"I used it for a simple BT connection to my Pixel 3 phone only. The sound is not that melo overall! The bass is very weak, the vocal is outstanding but overkill.

I guess it is designed for Samsung wearable devices in general..",2,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0

I have owned these ear buds for just over 3 months and the left bud is so quite as to be inaudible. I know of other people that have owned these buds and they have the same issues.

WOW these are great. I use them for watching movies on my iPad and iPhone. They sound unreal but I am just a regular person not a music buff. Love them as they are small compared to other I have seen and own.,5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
I was skeptical about buying an expensive pair of ear buds without some sort of wire keeping them together. I did some research and chose the buds+ and really glad I did! They seem to be staying in my ear really nice and comfortably and the sound is amazing. I love the red!,5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"Sound great! Definitely an improvement over the first version. Pairing was simple on all devices (Note10+, two laptops and iPhone 7). The upgraded ambient sound is phenomenal and crazy how well it enhances sound especially if you use the Samsung Labs enhanced option.",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0

"My only gripe with these is that I wish they were a bit smaller. Even with the smallest attachments they are too big and eventually slip out of my ears.

"We are another happy customer, at the start of our purchase, but now, just days after the return window has closed, the ear buds have stopped working.

Just returned these. The left earbud would disconnect on a regular basis and the right seemed to not be able to hold a charge. The left one would be at 80 percent or better but the right would run out if juice. And yes they were both fully charged at first.,1,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0

Now I don‚Äôt need to with these Buds+. So far, so good. I hope they are durable.",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
Extremely unsatisfied. These completely died within three weeks of purchase. Volume went to about 10% of normal on left earbud. Then the Bluetooth issues kicked in.

Well they sounded dope while they worked 100%. I bought these day 1 and they were great. A month and a half later when I get a phone call they have a weird tinny sound to them and it's annoying to listen to. While listening to music or videos it sounds great. Phone calls sound like garbage.,2,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"My buds plus stopped charging after 5 months.  I called Samsung for help and they told me that they wound email me a shipping label for a return.  A week later, no label was sent.

"Upgraded from gen 1 galaxy buds expecting to use the mutipoint connect feature between my Windows tablet and phone.  This feature is ONLY available on Galaxy phones with SmartThings installed.

"***Long story short (This section is the whole review in a nutshell): These new Galaxy Buds+ are a SIGNIFICANT improvement over the original 2019 Galaxy Buds that released. I personally felt that the 2019 Galaxy Buds were a total failure for phone calls...and Samsung isn't lying when they say that they have improved call quality on these 2020 Galaxy Buds+! While many other reviews may have said that the ‚Äúslight‚Äù improvements to the new Galaxy Buds+ are worth it, I have to say that the call quality is a GIGANTIC improvement on these new 2020 Galaxy Buds+. The original form-factor from the 2019 Galaxy Buds has remained for the new 2020 Galaxy Buds+ (and that‚Äôs a good thing), the Buds+ case easily fits into your pocket without taking up too much space, the Buds+ go into your ears perfect each time, they fit snug and stay in for many hours without hurting, they weigh nothing, they charge fast and the bigger battery lasts forever, they sound EXCELLENT with plenty of highs and lows which is an improvement over the original 2019 Buds, and most importantly, they are FANTASTIC for phone calls! The new 2020 Galaxy Buds+ microphones DO NOT pick-up tons of background noise while you are on a call like the original 2019 Galaxy Buds did (and this part leaves me ecstatic). I want to point out that the new Galaxy Buds+ are not perfect, and they do pick-up background noise, but it is a completely acceptable level of background noise‚Ä¶and the new 2020 Galaxy Buds+ pick-up nowhere near as much background noise as the original 2019 Galaxy Buds did, and not as much background noise as the many other wireless buds that I‚Äôve tried including Apple Airpods 2nd Gen.***Why am I so happy?:",5,0,2020-2-17,1,3,1
"Customer support:  I couldn't get my buds to pair on Windows.  I used the online chat and was redirected to a support team that was supposedly specifically for the Buds+.  First CS rep was having multiple conversations and pasted an answer to another customer into my chat.  He told me completely useless and unrelated instructions originally, and then send me a link to pairing instructions last iteration of buds (not the Buds+).  After I informed him that I followed the steps, the chat went dead for 5 minutes.  I asked if he was still there and didn't get a response for another few so I just disconnected.  I called in and went through the automated workflow.  It very misleadingly tells you that you can additionally be sent an external repair center location, which actually just disconnects your call (instead of just sending you the location in parallel).  It tries to disconnect you again a second time by asking you to get support through text.  When I finally reached support, I was redirected to another line that is supposedly specifically for the Buds+.  The person on the line was very nice, but told me Windows was not supported (it is in fact supported!  I got it to pair like any normal Bluetooth hardware on both Windows and Mac...I had a hardware issue I wasn't able to diagnose until I got to test pairing on another machine).  I explicitly followed up and asked...so it's not supported on Windows even though it's a Bluetooth device and I was told yes.  Overall, the support was so bad, I had to dock the buds two stars because if anything goes wrong with these buds, you're probably screwed.Battery: It's long.  I tried to drain it to zero to get an estimate of how long it would last, but I simply could not listen to 11 hours of music in one day.  After about 4 hours of listening and a couple of hours of idling outside of the case, I still had about 60% battery left (don't try to extrapolate that, it might not be linear).",3,0,2020-2-19,1,3,0

"I've used Bose Soundsports and Soundsport Frees, Jabra 65t Elites, and a slew of cheaper true wireless or semi-wireless (one wire connecting the two earbuds) units from Mpow, JVC, etc. These are, without a doubt, the best combination of comfort, size, battery life, sound quality, noise reduction, and call quality of all of them.The Soundsports sound good but aren't true wireless. The Soundsport Frees had good sound but were bulky and didn't feel secure in my ears while running (specifically, I have trouble with ear buds in my left ear). Battery life was average. The cheaper Mpow and JVC had poor sound quality and battery life and while they weren't as bulky as the Bose, they still stuck out of my ear.",5,0,2020-6-16,1,1,0
"According to my wife, I have an ear bud problem. I own or have owned at least a dozen sets of buds including the class leading Sony WF1000's, both the Jabra 65t and 75t, the original Galaxy Buds, Jaybird Vista's, and many others over the years. As I have tried to explain to my wife, this is necessary because every one of these devices have strengths and weaknesses but none can do it all really well. For example, the Jaybird Vista's are impervious to water and are very secure. Perfect when I run. However, after extended wear they become uncomfortable in my ears. The Sony's have the best sound and noise cancelling I have heard. Again though, somewhat awkward in the ear and no water proofing at all so no good for a workout. The Jabras are the closest but the 65t model is just too big by today's standards and the 75t has a seam that just starts to irritate my ear over time. Enter the Galaxy Buds Plus. You get good to great sound, moderate water resistance, and all day comfort. Oh, and that's a good thing because they get nearly 11 hours on a charge. So here are my pro's and con's to the Galaxy Buds Plus:The good:",5,0,2020-6-4,1,1,1
"Unfortunately, for me, I purchased these from Verizon to use with my Windows 10 PC.  I have bluetooth built into my rig and use windows 10 pro edition.  I bought these because I want to watch Netflix, Amazon Prime and other movies while doing my workouts.  I tried for some time to actually get these to be recognized and paired to my pc and finally did.  That's when all the troubles started to happen.  I won't go into too much detail, but to summarize, the connection was very unstable at best, the sound was not clear at all, and for some bizarre reason, it would actually cause my PC to freeze  and require a reboot.  It just wouldn't work no matter what I tried to do for work arounds and caused some unexplained serious pc problems as well.  PLEASE, if you are ordering these for watching streamed movies from your windows 10 pc, DON'T.  I'm sure it works just fine with your samsung phones, but that's about it.  Also, ordered mine from verizon, they had a great deal for less money than AMAZON, BUT BEWARE, they will charge a re-stocking fee of $50.00.  Youch!",1,0,2020-8-17,1,1,0
"These are terrific for iPhone users!  Apple earbuds were too loose. Samsung Buds fit great but didn‚Äôt pair well.Fit - My ear canal is a bit larger. I typically need to use the bigger spare bud size. Both med and large fit my ears really well but the large seals better so it brings out the base. Also, the Apple ones are loose in my ear.

I bought these through samsung but let me first say I am apple all the way from iPhone iPad to airpods all generation including pros. I'm really invested in earbuds and headphones but lete say I had my doudts on these but had to give them a try. When it came to battery life blew my mind was an hour more then said on med volume. Sound quality is excellent I would say just as good as pros. Comfort is better then my pros the pros often hurt my ear like a suction type hurt these I have slept with them on. Call quality excellent but I feel pros had a bit more clarity on both ends of speakering and hearing. There is no noise cancelation which pros is so amazing I love playing with it but putting these in correctly make a good block of outside noise. The touch sensor I wish wasn't so sensitive but in all I find myself reaching for these more then my pros lately.

"I'm sure that if you can get a good seal in your ears with these that they could sound decent.  I just got these and the largest size tips are barely a medium size in other types of tips.  I was searching for large but the largest these have are still way too small for my ears so I cannot get any type of seal.  I will see if I can find a substitute tip that will work for my ears, BUT, I am concerned about the tiny case these come in and any larger tips may not fit in the case for charging which will be a big problem.  I can't understand why they are designed the way they are...case is too small, tips are too small and because of the small case, this will limit tip substitutes.  I luckily get these using points I had from Samsung otherwise I would immediately send these back.  Even with correct size tips, not sure they will work due to their design...I am amazed of the overall good reviews for these...they all must have tiny ears.UPDATE- I was able to custom fit some SHURE foam tips I have using my Dremel tool to enlarge the hole on the foam tip so they would fit the earbuds.....did make that seal that is needed and did improve the sound a bit.  I also went back to my phone and located an app that allows you to increase the volume significantly.  Even after all that, I would rate these 2.5 stars, maybe 3 for sound quality....but, out of the box, these just don't work at all for fit and sound quality....you really have to do some work to make them sound just OK.",2,0,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"So far I am very pleased with these updated Galaxy Buds. The battery life can't be expressed enough as a virtue of these buds because I can finally use them through an entire workday without needing to recharge. They could have sounded like tin cans as long as the battery life met my expectations.But I'm pleased to report these do not in fact sound like tin cans, but instead very rich and full sound without distortion or lag when streaming video. I am not much of an audiophile but I am a music lover and I do not discriminate too heavily when judging wireless earbuds because the main bonus for having wireless buds is being able to listen as long as possible without fatiguing the ear or running out of power before the listener is done listening as well as not getting wrapped up in a cable when you get up from your desk to file some paperwork or refill your coffee cup.  And I am pleased to say that these check all of the above boxes and more.",5,0,2020-2-19,1,0,0

I am on my 3rd pair and as with the last 2 the left earbud is done for. I am pro samsung ...... I have 2 pair of iconx, a pair of the buds, and buds plus..... these sound amazing but I'm switching over to sony for my ear bud needs. Spend the extra and get the WF-1000XM3 while they are on sale.

I have been a Smasung fan for years but buying the Earbuds and them only getting 9 months of use before the left one stopped working and of course there is basically no warranty unless you purchased the extended warranty your pretty much out of luck Amazon says to bad so sad well Samsung and Amazon your out of luck with me if you think your the only game in town think again I do not recommend thes at all.,1,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0

"I purchased these directly from Samsung as the color I wanted was  and still isout of stock here at Amazon at the time of this writing. I was excited to get these as my pre-existing wireless headphones had a really bad audio latency issue (like 1 second) that is really annoying while doing retro gaming on the S7 (I have emulators for basically every 16 bit system from the 80's and 90's, to include Neo Geo). I got the Buds+ in today, and while initially blown away with the quality of the audio, when I try to game on my S7 there seems to be some kind of conflict with the XBox One Wireless controller that also connects to it via Bluetooth. There is a split-second cut-out every 4-5 seconds and there are various audio defects, such as squeaking etc (if you've ever heard a badly record MP3 file you may know what I'm talking about). This issue wasn't present with the PowerBeats that these replaced. There is no audio latency now, but these are basically unusable for this activity and I'm pretty bummed. I googled the problem but didn't find anything or other complaints with the search query terms: Galaxy Buds, Wireless Controller, Conflict etc.This issue is only present when trying to use both the Buds+ and the Xbox One Wireless Controller (also knows as Microsoft Wireless Controller.",3,0,2020-2-25,1,0,0
For wireless earbuds they do sound good however not as good as quality wired buds.  Charge quick and last quite well.  They do pair with our Samsung TV but the volume isn't very high and can't figure out how to change that.  TV remote shows earbuds on the screen when changing volume button but volume doesn't change.  If I get this to work ill update the review.  Bought mine directly from Samsung because had a $50 worth of points.Update.  In tha app there's a tab called lab.  In there you can set the buds to adjust the volume by touching the side of each bud.  Doing so allows you to increase the volume when pared to the TV.,4,0,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"These are my first pair of truly wireless earbuds. Coming from using mid-tier priced 'non-true' wireless earphones (strand or cord connecting both earphones or buds in the $50 range), for $150, I was expecting to be a bit more blown away. First things first, the sound quality is probably most important. It is pretty good, but I was expecting the highs to be a bit more cleaner and the bass to be a bit better and hit harder. Next the battery life is pretty good but from what I was hearing about them being the longest lasting true wireless earbuds on the market, I was expecting it to last longer than being wiped out after using intermittently throughout the workday. Microphone quality seems to be pretty good as I have no complaints and people can't tell I'm using earphones/buds. No active noise cancellation for $150 seems crazy but that was something I knew going in, I just expected the other factors to be better if ANC was not offered. Now the one thing that knocked off a whole star off the review is bluetooth multipoint/multidevice connectivity. My cheap $20 mpow bluetooth earphones handle multiple devices better than these galaxy buds! I connect these to my samsung android phone and computer. These earbuds don't automatically switch from one to another based on sound/voice output from the phone or computer like my cheap $20 mpow ones do! You have to manually open up the bluetooth settings on the phone or computer and hit 'connect' to switch. Next, my computer often goes to sleep throughout the workday. Everytime it turns on when I hit the mouse or keyboard, the buds switch over to the computer while I'm listening to music on my phone. Very annoying. My cheap $20 mpow bluetooth earphones don't do this. I'm quite flabbergasted Samsung hasn't figured this out for what these cost.",3,0,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"I put off buying wireless ear buds the past couple years but have been wanting a pair for the past year since the technology has been improving. I was going to get the original Galaxy Buds but I waited and boy am I glad I did!! I regularly wear hearing aids so I wanted some buds that would be clear and loud. So I found these after comparing them to all the higher priced and some lower prices competitors. So I went with the Buds Plus and Active Noise Cancelling aside, these are the best ear buds I've ever had. After finding the right combo of rubber tips that were sent with my new Buds Plus, I gave them a go. At first I was impressed with the clarity of the Buds Plus. I was listening to songs I'd heard many times before and I was hearing lyrics that I used to not be able to hear clearly. On the loudest setting with the right combo of tips and getting the ear buds snuggly into my ear, the volume level is sufficient and I listen to a lot of Sirius-XM Octane. I have a Galaxy S9 and I fugured out that if I find a song I like on Octane I can download it on Spotify and it gives me a volume level boost on Dynamic mode. The Ambient noise feature was also impressive and I really enjoy the Extreme setting in the Labs tab of the Galaxy Wearable app. If felt like I had hearing aids and earbuds in at the same time! With the added luxury of an 11-hour continuous charge, I haven't been able to run the battery down on these bad boys and I just finished a flight from Las Vegas to Omaha, Nebraska and then drove back. As far as the tap control goes, it is really cool and easy to use after getting used to the touch points and number of taps forneach function. If you want clean quality sounds with great technology at $100 less than comparable ear buds on the market, then these are an awesome deal. Phone calls, Zoom, and Video Conferences are all extremely clear and there is no lag while watching tv shows or videos. I give these babies a 9.3 out of 10.",5,0,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"The design is faulty. With the slightest wind, the wind noise gets amplified to the point that anyone speaking to you cannot hear you and you cannot hear music well. This means if you run. Faster than a 9 min/mile, the wind will interfere with sound quality and it worsens incrementally. So disappointing",1,0,2020-3-28,1,1,0
"These are great. I wanted the convenience of long battery life in a TRUE wireless bud, and these deliver. They are VERY comfortable, at least for my ears. They're also held securely in place with a slim silhouette, and no protruding stems. They recharge FAST.As far as sound quality, they're not Sennheiser 600s, but for this design and price point, they might be as good as it gets. I just don't have a way to benchmark them against competitors. But the convenience and ease of use make these a great product for all day use any time you like.",5,0,2020-3-24,1,0,0
"I've been using these buds on a daily basis for a few months, primarily for phone calls. I purchased these for comfort,  ease of use, and long battery life, and am very pleased with the results. As others have pointed out, the battery life is superb. Audio for music is good, and the settings allow customization of how much external audio to let in. iOS connectivity works just fine.For phone calls, there is a critical design flaw: there is no way to disable the dropping of calls that result from accidental touches or manipulation of the earbuds while on a call. Samsung has confirmed that it is not possible to disable or circumvent this behavior. Expect dropped calls, as, in my experience, it is almost impossible not to touch these earbuds in the wrong way.",3,0,2020-9-4,1,0,0
I bought these to use with my Galaxy S9 phone. Whenever the phone is lower than my chest the connectivity takes a dump and calls become terrible. I tried calling Samsung but they weren't available.

I originally got these to listen to podcasts at work where I would need some ambient sounds coming in. Now they're my daily drivers for music. One important thing: you need the correct tips. I have a whole bunch on hand to try (spinfit, comply, spiral dots). The foam ones while being the least comfortable, unfortunately give the best bass.

"I bought these as I lost my first pair of galaxy buds, so figured might as well go for the ""plus"" version. I went with red just to make them easier to find if I misplace them again :) Since I have owned both versions, I can say definitively that the + version is much better. I mostly use them for listening to music and I've definitely noticed a much better sound coming out of these ones. Call quality also seems better, can't say I've used them for calls very much though.They also seem to sit a bit better and are more comfortable as well.",5,1,2020-5-8,0,2,0
"Nunca habia usado unos de estos y la verdad ten√≠a curiosidad, el sonido es aceptable, pero creo que a mi en lo particular me lastiman un poco, ya probe con las almohadillas que trae (tres tama√±os) pero no los puedo usar mas de 1 hora continua. No los recomiendo como sistema primario de escucha/habla si es que tienen juntas y llamadas todo el dia.",4,1,2020-8-10,0,1,0
