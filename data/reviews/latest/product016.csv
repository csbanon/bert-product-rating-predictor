"I previously owned a Spark for many years and was thinking of upgrading to Mavic Mini. But then, Mavic Air 2 was released and considering the Features presented and the remote (the previous DJI remotes are quite a hassle to attach to the phone in my opinion), I think I give this a go. Just received this Fly More Combo today, and flew on the same day. I am speechless and it truly exceeds spark in every way. So happy that I bought it. I'll still keep my Spark because it is still a great drone.Pros:",5,1,2020-5-24,1,3,1
I sold my Mavic air and got this. Reading from some of you with activation issues got me worried but I didn’t have that issue. I already read about using the battery charging hub may not charge 100% and so I charge it one by one.Remember the hub do not charge all batteries at once. It charges one after the other.,4,1,2020-5-30,1,3,1
"The most important feature I was looking for with Mavic Air 2 was ""4K 60 fps"" - this works only when the drone is manually controlled with your remote.  However, it does not work with ""Follow Me"" nor with ""Circle"" mode.  This is a big bummer and a deal breaker for me.Also, ""boomerang"" mode and other quick shot mode do not work on the moving subject.",2,1,2020-5-24,1,4,0
"I fly FPV freestyle (totally different, for racing fast, etc) and needed a proper camera drone. Really torn between the Mini and Air 2. My buddy has the Mini, so I flew the Mini. The Mini is very impressive, to be honest, its the perfect all-around drone, I mean yeah the Air 2 offers a few more features, but in the big picture the Mini is very very tempting and half the price (Fly More Combo).But after flying it and getting way too any ""Wind is strong"" alerts on a really nice day that was not windy at all. I understand its different, and it's like comparing apples to pears, but we all want what's best for us. But... there is the temptation to get a real drone meaning its over 250 grams and is not really considered a ""toy"" which really looks like.  I have another 3 weeks to decide if the Air 2 is staying, but I am pretty sure what I have done and seen so far, I can't get rid of it! The Mini will feel like a toy and Ill always be worrying it is gonna get ""blown out of the sky"" which they are known for due to the size.",5,1,2020-6-17,1,2,1
"Ordered a new unit and went to register and activate in order to be able to fly the unit, wouldn’t activate and the app told me to contact DJI for support. The support team told me it was defective and offered to replace it. I have not received the return label they have promised to email both times I have called. Contacted Amazon for a return or exchange and they won’t offer any solution other than contact DJI. I keep getting the run around meanwhile I’m stuck with a defective unit and a deadline for the reason I bought it in the first place.Do not buy this drone or any DJI drone off amazon upon further reviews other people have had similar experiences. This makes me question the integrity of these units sold on Amazon. I would buy in person from a big box if I had to do it over.",1,1,2020-6-16,1,4,0
"The best drone out for most people for a good decent price. I love this thing. My brother got a dji pro platinum a while back for a steal.. Right time right place... Talking under 500 bucks ever since I have wanted one but never could spend 1500 on one so bought a few cheaper ones and there ok but I craved distance.. Then bought a really good cheap one and it was up there in flying experience.... Not toy level but although went farther than all my previous ones... Wasn't enough. I wanted something that I could safety go 2 miles or something.. Then air 2 was out, still alot more than iam used to spending on... Let's face it, a toy for me anyways, iam not a professional photographer or anything. But with Amazon's no interest payments I went for it.. And will never regret it. I love this thing. Still haven't Gotton to do my 2 miles out as iam sure this just isn't possible unless you live out in the open but nothing stopping me from jumping in the truck and finding a good area. Just wanted to be able to walk out my front door. And I don't live in city, small desert town of less than 3000 people... Actually ideal place to fly.",5,1,2020-7-2,1,2,0
"This is a product support review, as I could not ""activate"" or ""re-activate"" the drone as I was told to do during the binding process.  After struggling to find a contact number, but not before being channeled into an unresponsive ""chat"" support (no one attended after fifteen minutes), I was told by the tech support, after only a couple of questions to return the Mavic Air 2.  I wasted most of my morning only to find out that it was defective.  My web searches found many that had many, and some similar issues.  Is this product really ready for prime time, is the tech support operation up to the demand?  Discouraging, but I will likely give them one more try.",2,1,2020-5-28,1,4,0
"The new Air 2 Mavic did not disappoint me. Battery life is way better than the spark I had before. distance I can fly is way better. Even outside of line of sight, I have ventured 2 miles with no loss of signal. that is about my limit on comfort though. Its very fast 44mph and the camera is good. I cant see a significant difference in the camera itself but the new modes I get with the app are nice. I have tried HDR and a few others. They are nice to have, but I can do most of that with the Spark. Overall I am very pleased with this drone, If it crashed I would buy the same one again.I really love this thing. It seems to have all the features that are important to me.  i even like the hand controller. I really love the fact that the cable to attach to the phone stays inside the controller. All I have to grab is my controller and the drone and I am off to fly. No more searching for where I put the cable. Its much easier to grab and go.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,2,0
"I bought the regular product, but after my first fly, I discovered that the battery just allow to fly for 20min, no 34 as described by DJi. Anyway, I loved and I started to search more battery to buy and I found the combo called by ""fly more""... that you pay more 184 bucks and you get a lot of things including 3 batteries and 3 lens. I tried to trade but the Amazon do not allow and ask me to return. When I return, on the end of the process the Amazon removed my option to put my money as credit, to buy another on the same day and pay the difference... now I'll need to wait 7 days to receive my money on my debit card. For this reason I'll buy the combo ""fly more"" on another store, to fly weekend. I love the Amazon and I loved this drone. I recommend seriously this amazing product for everyone that dream to fly like a bird, but I recommend 3 batteries, because only one it's impossible to enjoy the product. Also, pay attention about your debit card transaction to avoid what's happening with me about only one option to return your money, just in case.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,2,0
"I was really excited for this drone to come in. I originally bought the Mavic mini but decided to go with the Air 2 after reading many impressive reviews. Little did I know that (after already being delayed once) my order would arrive without the needed RC cables! The only one it came with was the lightning cable, and the drone is now useless to me since I have an android. Very upset, I was highly anticipating this drone.I'm going to be returning promptly and won't be buying from them again. On the bright side, I now have $860 to spend on my FPV quad.",1,1,2020-6-3,1,4,0
Unboxing on my Youtube Channel from a real consumer standpoint coming on the 19th when it is shipped head over and subscribe to Youtube/ ChoochTech to be the first to see how this thing really performs. I'm going to put it through the ringer!,5,0,2020-5-12,1,7,0
Was looking to upgrade and test out a DJI drone but sis not want to spend a fortune.I ordered the MA 2  before it was released and have been very happy with the design and function.,5,1,2020-6-9,1,2,0
"This is the one. The hype surrounding the release of the DJI Mavic Air 2 couldn't be touched or even measured on our measly human scales. I'm pleased to report that this drone doesn't disappoint, but that doesn't mean its perfect. Let's start with the pros.Image quality: The Mavic Air two improve its image quality over its predecessor by including a 48 MP quad Bayer sensor. (More on this later) The sensor is able to combine 4 pixels together for better lowlight capabilities,  HDR photo and video, or in ideal lighting use the 48 MP for extra details.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,1,0
"This thing has ADS-B!  I work for the FAA and was really surprised to see this tiny drone have ADS-B.  It has all the features of some of the best more expensive drones out there.  I've only had it a few weeks and there are so much more to play with.  I really like the AEB 5 shot.  I'm a photographer and love the dynamic range you can achieve with a 5 shot HDR  using the AEB feature.  I also turned on RAW for all the photos as I noticed some of the JPG's had an odd tint to it, probably from guessing what the lighting situation was.  Shoot in RAW and you can select ""Cloudy, Sunny etc."" in post.  Video's are really neat and I'm still learning.  The drone felt a whole lot better made than it looked online.  Only CONS so far is my dogs want to attack it, and no side or back sensors to prevent collisions in all directions.  But if it did have them, it would leave nothing for the PRO versions.  However it see's ahead while flying and compensates very well.",5,1,2020-6-26,1,1,1
"Google 0xffe error on these products. I contacted support and they just said that it is a DOA issue. They have no fix for it and they will do nothing for you for having shipped a defective product. DJI is sending out 1,000 bricks.",1,1,2020-6-2,1,4,0
"I have had the Phantom 4 for years and as much as that one is more expensive, I feel like Mavic Air 2 is one hell of a upgrade. The size is absolutely perfect for me. Not super small like the mini which would make it more difficult to fly in moderate wind and has significantly more Technology on board. The video quality and quick shots are excellent for most users. I would consider my skill level with drones and photography (i shoot with professional  DSLR) as intermediate to advanced. I can definitely appreciate the simplicity of some of the functions that this drone offers without getting overly technical and caught up in those details that take away from focusing on setting up creative shots. The air sense on the drone is also a great addition and peace of mind. When an aircraft gets within hey specific range of the drone went in flight you get a very useful map of where that plane is in relation to your drone.",5,1,2020-6-2,1,1,0
"Frustrations:1) POOR QUALITY CONTROL - there are two types of propellers required. The motors are supposed to be marked or unmarked, and then matched to the corresponding propeller - marked or unmarked. My drone had THREE marked motors and ONE unmarked motor. There are supposed to be two and two. This poor quality control on DJI's part. If I hadn't caught their mistake then my drone would have spiraled and crashed.",2,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"I've owned a DJI Spark since 2017 and was in the market to upgrade. I considered the Autel Evo II, Skydio 2, Mavic 2 Zoom and Mavic Air 2.  Hands down, the best value is the Mavic Air 2. I stress value since the other drones arguably have more capabilities but I am a casual flyer; not a professional or for profit flyer.For a quick rundown, the issues with the Spark are its short flight time. It seems every time I just got into flying, it was time to change the battery. Not so with the Air 2.",4,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0
Wish I would have read the reviews BEFORE I wasted my time and money on something that I never could get to work!! Returning today. Such a disappointment. Terrible customer service as well.,1,1,2020-6-9,1,4,1
Unable to activate drone. Tried multiple phones and nothing. I even downloaded dji flight assistant on the pc and reinstalled firmware and nothing. Extremely disappointed with DJI. Their customer service is a joke.5/30/2020 UPDATE:,1,1,2020-5-24,1,4,1
"Awesome product , takes great photos.",4,1,2020-5-17,1,4,0
"You'd think for $800, or actually $988 plus tax, this thing would last longer than 26 hours.  2 hours of flying and now there's a malfunction message ""Gimbal Motor Overload"".For all the delays DJI had finally delivering this, you'd think they'd have the bugs worked out. First it was the wait because the multi charger was  destroying batteries.  Now it's the camera / gimbal motors malfunctioning after very little use.  I HIGHLY suggest considering another company.",1,1,2020-5-22,1,3,0
"Well, so much for the crash avoidance feature.  It was doing a helix and crashed into a tree and it now trapped in the tree, 100 ft up.  It actually flew threw branches to get itself wedged in.  It was kind enough to let me know a motor was broken, so, I couldn't even get it to try and free itself.  It's up there until a tornado comes through.  Well, there goes my $988 investment, up in smoke.",1,1,2020-5-26,1,3,0
"I hardly ever write reviews, but I feel compelled to write one for this product because I had such hard for such an expensive product. I got a brand new Mavic Air 2 just a few days ago, and it has never taken off once. First, the aircraft never turned on completely. It got stuck in the initialization. Each time it would try to turn it on, it would fail. Then, I call their technical support and had to wait for an hour. Their technical support was some sort of a third party company in India that knows nothing about the product and speaks poor English telling me to do things that had nothing to do with the issue, giving me options that didn't work. After a very long and painful process they finally tell me that I need to send the unit back to DJI so they can check what is wrong with it. Time to get it back? ONE MONTH!  NOPE! I have now returned the Air 2 since their technical support is trash. If you are thinking about getting one of their products, be prepared to fix any issues you have with it.",1,1,2020-6-9,1,2,0

"Very disappointed with this purchase. DJI needs to do a better job testing all these drones before they put them in the market. If you received the following message during the activation of your DJI Mavic Air 2 ""error code: 0xffe"" you'll have to send your done back for replacement. Based on the number of people who have encountered and posted about the same problem on DJI forums. I'm certain I'm not the only one. If you plan to purchase a DJI Mavic Air 2 just have your fingers crossed and pray you don't get a paperweight.",1,1,2020-5-25,1,2,0
"If you're interested in spending a thousand dollars to play beta tester for DJI, go ahead and purchase the Mavic Air 2, and I'm sure they'll appreciate another sucker. Absolutely ridiculous, just look at so many of the other bad reviews. Mine is an expensive paperweight. Remote controller did not come connected to the drone and after manually trying to get the two to pair, the bottom line is that they simply don't see each other. Nothing works, I tried every method possible. I'm done with this piece of junk. I have zero interest in getting a replacement because their batting average totally stinks, just look at the reviews. This was my first (and last!) DJI drone purchase and this piece of junk is going back for a full refund!",1,1,2020-5-31,1,1,0
"I'll be honest, this DJI Mavic Air 2 is the first drone I've owned (or even flown). That being said, I've had it for a week and already feel confident while flying and controlling the camera gimbal. This quadcopter is extremely stable and easy to fly (for basic maneuvers), and the flight controls are very intuitive, allowing you to advance to some skillful flights and shots.The Fly More kit seems a necessity to me. My first flight day was about 1 hour, and depleted two batteries. I can't imagine to being limited to just the one battery that comes with the aircraft. In this week I also had an incident that scuffed up the blades. That makes it clear how easy it can be to ruin a set of blades, so the extra blades are nice. The 3-batter charging dock is also extremely important with your 3 batteries. The batteries take a while to charge, and you have to remember to swap them out if you want to finish charging to fly the next day. The charging dock automatically switches from charging one battery to the next when the first is fully charged.",5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,1
"I have been a user of DJI just about since there was a DJI. My past included the Phantom 3 Advanced, Phantom 4 Pro, and now the Mavic Air 2. My P4P threw a prop and drove itself into the ground at 40' in the air. It was completely totaled. Since DJI would definitely not accept fault (I know from previous crashes of my DJI drones), I figured I would look for another. I wanted USA built which is still not here on a regular basis and availability so I gave my only option to a substitute, the new MA2. Given the specs and reviews, and the lower pricing vs. their counterparts of the Mavic line, I found it quite refreshing. It is perceived newer technology and more user-friendly while bringing in better quality. I still rather USA, but until then, this MA2 is awesome,",5,1,2020-8-8,1,1,0
"Just got my drone today and took it out of the box. Here's what to be aware of. The props are not labeled ""A"" or ""B"", the labeling is on the small package the props come in. You need to identify the props by the small white mark on the ""A"" props that matches the white mark on the motors and there is no mark on the ""B"" props or motors. The props must be installed correctly. Plugged the three batteries onto the charger, only one appeared to be charging so I am assuming they charge in a serial fashion rather then at the same time. The usb cables and other accessories were in the pouch under the carrying case ""lid""; I started to think they were missing, so look in all the pockets. The manual on the website is for the older Air 1 and is not usable with the Air 2. I contacted DJI support and they directed me to YouTube videos on how to setup and fly the drone. I'll update after the batteries are charged and I have had a chance to fly the drone.UPDATED Several Hours Later: The description says the App will work on an Android phone. Have downloaded and installed the App several times; will not install on an Android Samsung Galaxy Orbit 3. Verify if it will install on your android phone before ordering. Upon closer examination I noticed the App would work with a Samsung but only certain models. I now have to order a new phone just to use with the drone to get it to work. Purchased an Iphone 7 for less than $100 which works perfectly with the controller and drone. Watched the recommended video which was very well done. DJI support was extremely responsive and insured I was satisfied. I'm ready to fly. FYI: In addition to the DJI app get the B4UFly app which uses the phones GPS location to determine if there is any restrictions from the FAA for your location. Follow the rules, fines are expensive.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,1
"I really like this drone.  I haven't used it much yet, but it seems to be as advertised.  I still need to get it to follow something or us, and I haven't kept track of how long a battery lasts because I have only used it for short flights so far.  However, what I can say is that it is easy to control, the sensors keep you from wrecking relatively well (i did run into a bush when following my wife and mother, but it was the first time out.  The picture quality is very good but you cannot zoom in.  I didn't read that you could, and i wasn't expecting to need to but when you start using it, there are times when you do feel the need to zoom (like when i was inspecting my roof or when i was trying to see the fish in our pond).  I got three batteries and a charging station hub that holds 3 batteries, but only one battery charges at a time.  That is definitely odd to me but ok.  One of the three batteries will not charge or work in the drone - NOT OK.  I have contacted the vendor via e-mail.  We will see what they say.",4,1,2020-5-24,1,2,0
"It looked like a high quality drone. Packaging was superb. I charged all the batteries, read the instructions on line and watched youtube videos on the start up procedure. I downloaded the DJI app into my phone.Then I hit a snag. The app won't communicate with the remote.  App just just stops loading. Maybe a software issue.  I used another phone, downloaded the same app with the same results. So I wasted several hours for nothing. I returned it.",1,1,2020-5-30,1,1,0
"Got it right out of the box today! I was super hyped and just couldn’t wait to get a test flight on my rooftop. I used to play around with my neighbor’s Mavic Air, and guess what now! I got my first DJI drone!! I knew I was going to get my first drone from DJI, but just not sure if I should wait till the Mavic 3 release. But now I felt that Mavic Air 2 is just the perfect one for a newbie but who also wants more professional control over the camera like me. And I have to say that it felt so good flying it! I can’t wait to share some of my experience of my first flight here, so that you guys may decide whether this is the right one for you, and I’ll make sure to update my feedback here after I carried it around for some days.Basic Specs:",5,1,2020-5-25,1,2,0
"This is a great drone, especially for people who want something easy to learn and fly. It hovers extremely well, giving a newbie a chance to figure out what they want to do next. Flight controls are responsive and intuitive. The three modes (tripod, normal, and sport) provide different options for the pilot. Tripod flies the drone slowly for taking high quality videos (4K - 1080p - 720p). Normal mode flies the drone faster, and sport is fastest of all. In the Tripod and Normal modes, the drone has collision avoidance built in and gives the user three options if the drone senses an obstacle getting too close ahead of it, behind it, or below it. There is no collision avoidance on the sides of the drone or above it. The user has the option of ignoring collision avoidance, telling the drone to stop when it detects a nearby obstacle, or attempt to fly over or around the obstacle.There are also several automated flight options to have the drone fly around a selected object, or follow something or someone, and the slow motion video is also extraordinary. The video and photographs are of extremely high quality. Flight time can be as high as 40 minutes or so, although I'm reluctant to press the envelope here because I often fly it over water or in neighborhoods to do real estate videos. I'm quite impressed with everything about it.",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"This is a Chinese product and therefore quality control is an afterthought.  I had to return this because after hours of trying, the controller would not link to the drone.  In other words like a new car without a steering wheel!  The manufacturer DJI has a web site with a forum (to their credit) and this is a common problem.  However I submitted a detailed post in a single paragraph of about 15 lines to the forum detailing many problems and it was rejected as ""too long"" and I later realized that the forum editor probably worked for DJI and was not allowing posts that made DJI look bad.  Also many people complain that DJI tech support and return requests are nearly impossible to get since they don't answer their phones and don't follow up on RMI requests.  Please have second thoughts about buying this $800 drone.  The owners manual is 53 pages long and you must read every word. The drone is essentially computer controlled and therefore extremely complex.  Make one mistake the drone will end up in the water, in a tree, roof of a building, your neighbor's back yard, or simply fly off and you won't be able to find it.  Please read the DJI forum notes and Internet articles detailing all the problems this and other drones suffer from.  Also note that the public does not like drones and that includes your neighborhood.  You can easily make enemies of your neighbors not to mention ending up with your drone in their tree or back yard.  One person was arrested for shooting her neighbor's drone out of the sky with a shotgun!  Don't buy directly from DJI because of poor customer support.  Amazon is best.  To Amazon's credit they would not replace my drone, only give me a refund which implies that they are getting too many returns of this drone and are losing money on it.",3,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
"I've been a photographer for several years and had purchased a Mavic Mini however, from a professional photography perspective, this drone and the Mavic Mini are miles apart, it's like comparing apples and oranges, both are good, but they are totally different.  The quality of photos on this drone is far superior and the ability to take RAW photos is great for editing in Lightroom and Photoshop, although the JPEGS are easily usable with some quick edits on your mobil phone if you're in a rush to post something to social media.  The obstacle sensing is also very good.  I ran down a wooded trail and this had no problem avoiding tree limbs and keeping up with me.  I highly recommend for anyone who wants to get some amazing images and video at a reasonable price compared to other drones on the market with similar features.",5,1,2020-5-30,1,1,1
"I bought the Mavic Air 2 drone with the Fly More Combo and also the DJI Care Refresh.  Note, that when you first activate the drone you will also activate the DJI Care Refresh insurance - it is very quick and easy to do.  I’ve flown RC planes for years and have several drones also.  The Mavic Air 2 is the best thing I have EVER flown!  The control you have is excellent and the transmission from the drone to receiver could not be better.  I use a full-sized iPad as my screen so the view from the drone is excellent.  I did have to purchase a longer Lightning cord but I found a foot-long USB C-lightning cord on Amazon for $15 that works perfectly.The case they send you with the Fly More Combo is OK but far too small for all the things I use with the drone, so I ordered a Lukus M2 Backpack that will be large enough to carry everything for the drone and also a full-sized camera.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"I loved my original Mavic air.  Never had any issues with it but when I saw the mavic air 2 and all the things they upgraded, I could not resist upgrading.  Literally everything has been improved, the camera has a bigger image sensor, HDR video is awesome, it's stable and easy to maneuver, the DJI fly app is improved, the follow me modes with active track is night and day compared to the original, obstacle avoidance is improved, battery life in real world use is DOUBLE, and one of theost important things is the range with ocusync 2.0.  Even though I never fly it out of sight, I use to lose my video often on the original air, never happens with this one.  I just think it's an amazing piece of photography equipment.",5,1,2020-5-31,1,1,0
"Top quality product! I bought the DJI because of the reputation and features. The cost is a bit high but worth every penny!!!! The support is Excellent. Though the response was a bit slow due to the current pandemic challenges, tech support is very responsive and thorough. This product is full professional all the way, from the packaging and instructions to the software, operation and support. If you've ever operated a remote control vehicle, this will be very easy. I consider myself an experienced flyer, but even so I lost my drone due to unusual flight circumstances. Since I was unable to recover the aircraft for repair (went into a river), the FlySafe insurance did not cover it. However, support recommended that I submit flight logs for review, and after a few weeks they determined the loss was not pilot error and they replaced the aircraft under warranty at no cost! Gotta love that! Anyhow, with all the software features there is a lot to learn, but the available instructions are great. The aircraft stability is superb even in adverse conditions and all features are robust and function very well. What a dream to fly and own, I really love the Mavic Air 2 and I recommend it to anyone interested in getting a drone.",5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0

I preordered it and received it around May 16.There are other more expensive options out there, but I've had it now for three months, and I've yet to crash it even though it has only forward, reverse, and downward vision.  I don't do things that I would need upwards vision, and side vision would be nice, but I'm happy with my decision and got the most bang for the buck here.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,1,1
"I am a cityscape and urban photography hobbyist who wanted to increased my capabilities beyond just the ground. So far, the Mavic Air 2 has both satisfied my needs and introduced me to a new hobby.The most important feature to me was the camera. For my photography needs, it turned out to be above adequate but not outstanding. Due to the wide field of view, I planned to use 48MP mode to aggressively crop my photos. In practice, the 48MP images are a bit grainy and blurry when zoomed in, offering only a little improvement over the 12MP modes in terms of detail. Otherwise, image quality is good enough for generally impressive results after post-processing. I did not initially plan to record video on this drone, but after a few test shots, I found the video quality to be great (I use 4k mode) and opens the door for more types of content.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,2,1
"The DJI Mavic Air 2 is a drone with professional features at a much lower price point. The Fly More Combo includes everything that you will need for a successful flying session.Portability- The drone is a big improvement from the original DJI Mavic Air. One of the biggest changes is the design, it now resembles its bigger brother, the DJI Mavic Pro but the smaller formfactor allows it to live up to its reputation of being portable. The drone fits well in the shoulder bag along with 2 additional batteries, the remote, the charger and a couple of accessories like ND filters or any cables that you would need. The bag has plenty of room to spare and gives you ample room. The bag is also very well built and designed, made with durable materials and is comfortable and compact to carry anywhere.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,2,1
I ordered this for my husband when we got the drone it didn;t work. We spend an hour waiting to talk to someone at the company only to be told that is common problem and they can't do anything but take it back. They couldn't even give us a new one.,1,1,2020-5-27,1,6,0
This is the 6th drone I’ve ordered from DJI and the 1st time I had to wait for it to be released. Sure hope it’s worth the wait. Love my fleet.,5,0,2020-5-13,1,2,0
"At first, I hesitated to spend ~$1,000 for the combo package, but I think it was really worth it. The carrying bag is very convenient, easy to organize, and easy to use. Three batteries are MUST!! I made a sample video clip after experiencing Mavic Air 2 for 1 to 2 weeks. I hope you will like it.There are several things I would like DJI to make improvements for the future model:",5,1,2020-6-22,1,1,1
"Loved the drone the first battery! Second battery never worked right, and it got stuck in the drone, and melted a hole in the side of the battery! Third battery quit working mid flight (only 15’ up) and crashed. Amazon customer service? Very poor for this, would not let me return it. Hopefully a second call today can get something resolved. I have a 1000 worthless toy. Afraid to fly it again.",1,1,2020-6-12,1,8,1
"This is my 3rd drone. My first DJI drone. I purchased the fly more combo, plus an extra 4th battery. Very easy to fly. Great camera. Lots of photo and video options. I am very satisfied with the Drone. Remote is very simple and user-friendly.  #1 It has some object avoidance issues.  #2 and My biggest issue is with the batteries. You will NEVER get 30 minutes of flying time if you do not fly immediately after charging the batteries. After being fully charged and stored in the case, a week later the batteries are down to a 50%-60% charge. The longer you wait to fly it, the more the batteries will automatically discharge. This cuts your flying time drastically. I can understand if it were several months without use, but sitting idle and losing 5% over night, and 40%-50% in a week? Is this DJIs way of making you purchase more batteries at $115.00 each in order to increase you flying time? There's also an issue with charging the batteries that have ""gone to sleep"" as DJI calls it. Once the batteries sit idle and automatically discharge, you must put the batteries back in the drone to wake them up. You have to power up the drone, let it sit for several minutes, then turn it off, take them back out and let them sit for a few minutes, then put them on the charger. There are multiple complaints on other reviews on these same 2 issues. The multi charger that came with it never did work. Amazon quickly refunded the replacement cost, and I ordered the TOMAT 6 way multi charger. It is a must have! It charges everything at the same time. Why the idle discharge on the batteries is a mystery, and wish they'd fix it.",4,1,2020-7-20,1,0,1
"I just got mine last week. I’ve flown it probably 8 times so far and have a few things to report. Right out of the box, two things occurred to me. This is a smaller mavic pro with some nice enhancements. The bag that it comes with is well designed and the whole package fits nicely in a smaller space. It’s fantastic imo. Everything fits and there’s room for all the accessories.Image quality",5,1,2020-5-28,1,1,1
"I owe DJI my livelihood. Seriously, my ROI from their products is like 50k percent or something like that.They never disappoint. This is already my fourth drone, third one from DJI. For me, they are the best brand out there. I use the Mavic mini for places that have more restrictions, but mainly use the Mavic Air.",5,1,2020-5-23,1,2,1
"This drone is just about per-fit. Up to 6 miles flying over 34 minutes. The only bad thing about it, it comes from China. I'm buying very few things from China anymore. There is a drone that is better than this one and it is made in USA but $500 more money and I just didn't have it.UP DATE: I took one star away because of no support from DJI. I had a question for DJI and could get no response from trying to call their 800 number, e-mail or online chat. So I had to call Amazon to tell them I was going to send the drone back because of no contact with DJI. Well guess what, 5 minutes later I have DJI on the phone. I guess it pays to buy with a big enough co. that DJI will listen to.",4,1,2020-6-20,1,2,0
"This drone is fun to fly but for my use cases the additional cost when compared to the mini were just not worth it and so I will be returning it.  Here are some of those features I feel like I'm paying for but can't use or they did not make it clear on the product description.1. Filming at 60 FPS in 4K forces you to use the H.265 codec.  I have a pretty decent desktop (i7, 16GB Ram, Geforce 970) but video recorded with this codec version would not play back on my computer.  Worse, they don't give you an option to use .264 at 4k!  A fairly popular complaint on the DJI forums.",4,1,2020-9-22,1,1,0
"This product is faulty it has a very spotty connection with the Remote Control/It took several attempts just to get it to connect and when it did it would take several attempts to reconnect after being disconnected; I spent more time trying to connect to the remote control than flying; this would also burn out the battery of the DJI which limited any flight time. It had several IMU Error Messages, Contact DJI for support, 'Gimbal' errors. It is not easy to fly it has jerky fast motions that makes it easier to lose. Even at the slowest speed 'Tripod' it is very fast. Due to Covid it is an almost 2 hour wait time to speak to anyone regarding the product. I had also recently purchased a Mavic Mini which lost connection and flew into a tree, and I could not retrieve it due to the 'faint' start beeping and flashing feature. After I purchased Mavic Air 2 the DJI App wiped the data of where my lost Mavic Mini, which makes it even more difficult to locate. I had purchased the refresh plan but DJI only allows replacement if you are able to retrieve the damaged drone. This leaves me the buyer in a position where I stand to lose my drone any time a signal is lost. The updates of Mavic Air 2 firmware/Batter firmware did nothing to make the product work better. If you are considering purchasing this item I would strongly reconsider for the above reasons.",1,1,2020-6-15,1,7,0
"Dislikes are always first:1. The camera sensor is different.  Air 2 camera by default takes 12MP pictures.  It advertises a 48 MP camera, yet, you can only take 48 MP photo with the 48MP mode.  It is Bizarre and makes me feel that the sensor itself is not a 48 MP sensor.  I will need to read up on it more.  Some youtubers say nay and others concur.",4,1,2020-6-8,1,5,1
"Even if you CAN afford a DJI Mavic Pro 2 or better you still should consider this aircraft.I treat it is as my ""Flederkamera"" (flying camera), which is not a real German word but you get the idea.  The point is that this is fundamentally a camera I can use to get shots I cannot ordinarily get; I don't care that much that it's attached to an aircraft.  The video images are not the absolute highest end, but they are EXCELLENT!  This thing is well worth twice what one pays for it.  I got the combo, of course and I believe the extra batteries and accessories are a wise investment.  Yes, you can get better ND filters but the 16, 64 and 256 will work fine for most applications.",5,1,2020-8-31,1,4,0
"IDK why they even called this a Mavic,  It does not use the go4 app.  On obstacle avoidance and apas it flies at 5-10 mph tops.  Mine broke the first day from brushing a redwood tree brach.  The extended warranty costs 79 dollars plus 100 dollars per max 2 occurences.  The camera wojld sometimes get stuck all the way to the right which cannot be corrected.",1,1,2020-5-26,1,7,0
I have been flying drones professionally for major Hollywood sets for 5 years now. So it’s no surprise to me that DJI has continued to innovate with the release of the Mavic Air 2. It might be my favorite little drone to bring around. The 30+ min flight time and 48MP camera make it amazingly useful for pro or amateur use.In the Box FLY MORE Combo Initial Impressions,5,1,2020-5-27,1,6,1
"This drone started out awesome.  Then an update caused some issues.  I called customer service and after waiting hours to talk to someone I was told that they couldn’t help me because I was using an unsupported device.  I have a new Motorola droid phone.  They told me this once they found out I had it a couple days over a month.  Convenient.  They also made sure to tell me that I could no longer return it.  Their recommendation was to buy a Samsung phone and call back if it had issues after that.  Horrible company, don’t do business with them unless you don’t mind experiences like this!Amazon helped out though and took it back since it was falsely advertised as working with android.",1,1,2020-7-23,1,5,0
"This is by far the best drone I've ever owned. It's gymbal system and feature list is greater than most more expensive drones on the market. That being said, this drone is far less than perfect. For starters, the battery life is insufficient (about 20-25 minutes). For the size of the battery, I feel like they should last about an hour in normal conditions. Secondly, the Mavric Air 2 has many blind spots in their obstacle detection sensors. The drone has hit many trees on auto tracing. The Auto Tracing is also non sufficient. The done loses sight of targets very easily when a person croses similar colors with something they are wearing (black and grey is bad in city environments). Picture/video quality is sub par in less than perfect lighting, and even at 60 fps, the motion blur is way too apparent. As far as general design of the drone and controller, they are both bulky and seemingly out dated looking. The controller reminds me of a 1990s Game boy controller, but at least that part works flawlessly. Batter life on the controller is great, but the signal strength isn't great. In a residential area, an obstacle like a house limits your range to about 5-6 blocks. But, in an open area, I managed to get 3 miles out at 500 meters high. Very impressed there.Over all, a very capable piece of machinery. Can it be better? Absolutely. At $1100 for the Fly More Combo, I expected more. It needs more battery life, better lower light picture quality, better proximity sensors, and a much needed esthetics update. Imagine if, say, Samsung bought DJI and started backing their R+D. You can't tell me a better drone can't be made for a better price than it is right now.",4,1,2020-7-3,1,3,0
"It will not activate; same experience as many others. Amazon tech support is useless; DJI is little better. Drone returned for credit; received by Amazon on 6/3, no credit issued as of 6/7.

Error code when trying to bind camera to controller.  DJI says must be returned.  Of course now sold out.  Funny thing is that this problem has been noted in forums for weeks.  They continue to ship defective units.  Clearly the demo units for review were tweaked and many of the consumer items are bricks.  Probably need to wait a few months for DJI to get their quality control together.,1,1,2020-5-28,1,1,0
"Apparently, this release of product is having problems with activation. It fails to activate. Essentially, I have a $1000 brick sitting on my table. Research shows may consumers are having this very issue. Will likely be forced to return it. It's a shame as I was totally looking forward to flying tomorrow. Suggest you wait a month or two for bugs to be worked out.Gave it three stars for potential. I'm sure if you get one that activates it will be five stars.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,1,0
"I received this drone today. After installing all the necessary apps and charging the battery I was finally ready to connect it to the controller (and my phone). As so many others I got the error code 0xffe (activation error) and on the official dji forum and support I learned that it can not be fixed remotely, but has to be returned. Really? Very, very disappointed with dji..... Especially since I waited for it for quite some time and a replacement is not available on amazon. Which gives me time to re-consider buying anything else from dji....Drone will be returned as soon as the ups store is open. Since it is just a Software defect I hope shipping it with the appropriate Li-ion battery labels is okay. The device itself is not damaged.",1,1,2020-5-30,1,1,0

"0xffe is the error code I got. Similar to some of the other reviews as well. If you get this code while trying to activate your Mavic Air 2, there is no fix. I waited 2 hours 2 chat with support and they just told me to send it back, and that there was nothing they could do. Don't waste time trying to fix it, just get a refund from Amazon.I do plan on getting another one but I will wait a few months when they hammer out the bugs. I will update and change ratings as necessary.",1,1,2020-6-4,1,1,0
"I was a little surprised to see the Mavic 2 hit the market given the newly released Mavic Mini but I was excited none the less.  This is another massive amount of technology packed into a tiny flying robot from DJI.  I never ceases to amazes me at how DJI is able to build a camera that rivals most hand held prosumer cameras at a fraction of the price… did I mention that camera also fly’s autonomously with machine vision and obstacle avoidance?? Needless to say the Mavic Air 2 with the Fly More Combo is an INSANE deal at $988.This Fly more combo is pretty sweet and has everything the older Mavic kits have but with a few extra goodies.  I was really excited to see the Small ND kit with case in this combo. The Kit comes with a ND16, ND64, ND256 (4, 6 &8 Stops) This is such an essential piece of kit for making cinematic videos and being able to manipulate your photos or time lapses in creative ways. The new super slim 3 bay charger hub its extremely nice and the Mavic battery to USB hub is always a nice thing piece to have it the bag when you need to top off your controller or cell phone when out in the field.  One major change to this new edition to the Mavic line is the new controller and I absolutely LOVE it. I never liked the old Mavic controller. It was nice and compact but the usability of it was frustrating at best.  The new controller is a bit larger but it feels great in the hands and the phone mount is easy to use and pain free.  The phone mount also incorporates the antennas so you no longer have to worry about folding them our or breaking them.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,7,1
This is my first ever drone and I love it!I’ve been wanting a drone for quite a while and I’m so happy I waited for this gem. Produces great quality and captures nice photos!

Got some great short videos with QuickShots on our hike. The new ActiveTrack is really responsive. The camera is miles ahead of the Mavic Pro's. And it stayed in the air for a crazy long time!

"I've always designed and built my own drones from scratch or used frame kits to get started. Decide to go for a factory made drone due to the 1080p video link,range and folding portability. Flight characteristics are very smooth. Ive had it out over a mile and have very nice video link and control. The recorded video looks amazing. ONE SMALL GLITCH that may be a deal breaker for some, the gimbal sometimes suddenly jumps. I've seen this when making turns and sometimes in forward flight. It's not a constant thing but for every 10 minutes worth of flight it will do it a least 2 or 3 times. The gimbal jump is not extreme but it is very noticeable. Also I have not seen this on every flight so I'm thinking it could be something to do with shooting conditions at the time e.g sunlight or other weather conditions at the time. So, if you're the type of person that needs butter smooth video for many minutes at a time this may not be for you, at least for now. Hopefully this issue will be fixed with a firmware update and soon. Otherwise I think it's amazing. Live video HD video feed for miles at a time. Being able to lock on objects and people, long battery life. What more can you ask for? Oh yea fix the gimbal glitch. Otherwise highly recommended.",4,1,2020-7-28,1,3,0

"To be honest, I’m still on the fence with this one. Don’t get me wrong, this drone packs A TON of great features and makes flying for the beginner simple and easy. However, DJI has sorely handicapped the drones potential. Let me explain:1. 4K 60FPS is only available if you are manually flying the drone. If you attempt to use any of the “camera tracking” modes, it states that the feature is only available in 30FPS. WHY??!",4,1,2020-6-11,1,7,1
This Drone is freakin awesome. I’ve never operated a Drone before after getting this one I watched a Short YouTube video on what to do and what not to do and had it up in the air in no time. It almost flies itself is so easy and there’s actually a setting where it can. I got just over 31 minutes on my first flight and the video quality is amazing. I rarely leave reviews but I highly suggest buying this. I’ll be posting a lot of videos with it soon on my YouTube sailing hootie hoo if you wanna see how good it is for a rookie pilot and I’ve already got one up that shows the footage without any color grading.,5,1,2020-5-21,1,5,0
The price for this drone is just amazing. If you're stuck choosing between Mavic Air 2 or Mavic Pro 2 well if you're beginner definitely choose the Mavic Air 2. I feel like a newer version of Mavic Pro will come that'll hopefully record 4k 60p and have higher megapixel.Mavic Air 2 performance is outstanding! It takes really good video and picture which its surprising for its price. Low light is not the greatest but thats not really an issue. If it senses to close of an object it will not get near it. Flying any drone will take time to get used to it. I think the more time will be is being confortable.  Its really easy to fly I know you don't want anything bad happen to it cause you spend lots of money.,5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"I ordered the Mavic Air 2 and separately ordered DJI goggles based on the DJI website stating their goggles are compatible with the Mavic series.I don't know if they're playing games with brand names but it seems like the ""Mavic Air 2"" is part of the Mavic series.  Perhaps ""Mavic"" and ""Mavic Air 2"" are different series?  If so, this slight of hand allows them to opine on the greatness of the Mavic Air 2 as well as the DJI goggles, say that the goggles ARE compatible with the ""Mavic"" series, and then bury that they're not actually compatible off in the FAQ.

"After building my own and trying several off brands I bought a DJI Spark and fell in love.  When this drone entered the market it checked every box for me so I was quick to purchase.  It's by far the most expensive drone I've ever purchased, but you get what you pay for.The quality of the drone and it's video and photos are the best there is.  The MA2 is the best drone on the market.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"Very solid drone, I had the Mavic Air 1, and this one is what I would call an almost perfect drone.10/10 Range of the controller",5,1,2020-6-23,1,1,0
Beautiful brick..the 1st one I ordered was a brick it didn’t work the controller wouldn’t connect to my iphone 11 or my S10+ and it wasn’t user error this is nit my 1st drone from DJI I sent the 1st one back and ordered another one the 2nd one has been great so far no complaints at all...i did have a situation where i thought they didn’t send me all of my accessories but i later found them in the bag inside of a zipper in the gray area towards the top of the bag i hope this help someone because it had me pissed thinking they shorted me on accessories after spending over 1k$ lol,4,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"I bought this from Amazon about a month ago. I returned it on 9/11, with basically 1 day before my return window closed. About a week prior, after my first short flight of the day, the drone would no longer fly and had a processor overheating warning pop up in the app. I let the drone sit for more than an hour and couldn't clear the error.  The next day, I took it up for a ~5 min flight, landed it, turned it off and on, and same error. I got on touch with DJI support, who had me refresh the firmware through their PC app & USB cable, which cleared the processor overheating error, but as soon and I turned it off and back on again, the error was back. They recommended that I return aircraft to Amazon, so I did. I'm pretty disappointed.I also own a Phantom 3 Advanced, and while the Mavic Air 2 was working, it was fantastic! i live the different gimble modes that made the videos seem like you were flying an airplane. I love the portability of this drone, and ultimately purchased a hard case which I now cannot return. The video quality is nice and smooth, and it takes great pictures. The sport mode makes it go around 40mph, which was really fun for the few number of times I tried it. I wasn't able to test the ""follow me"" modes, but I was able to take a few panoramic photos and some 360 degree photos that were really cool!",2,1,2020-9-14,1,0,1
"This was the second drone I purchased and done a lot of research before I bought it. It's worth every penny and then some. I am no professional at all with this but this drone made by DJI has everything a beginner and expert needs to get the job done. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants to learn to fly drones and take AWESOME pics and videos without knowing a whole lot about photography.As far as the drone itself and controls, it's very easy to fly and the controls feel great in your hands. Only issue I wish DJI would fix with the controller is the phone holder. I would like for it to tilt a little more for a better view but still it's not show stopper. Probably the last drone I will ever have to purchase!!",5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"This drone exceeds my expectations. For a compact and lightweight drone, the 4K video is increíble. But I had no idea you can take delayed shutter images up to 8 seconds with manual camera settings. I took a pic of a lightening storm at 8 seconds delay at night at the beach and the drone was so still that the delayed shutter didn’t pick up any motion. Incredible. So glad I paid the extra for the fly more package. The 3 batteries and a charger that can charge all 3 batteries and the remote controller allowed me to enjoy this drone for an hour and a half. This carry case is so compact that I could carry the drone anywhere I go.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,1
My first time to use a drone and went to fly with my buddies withe theirs and they said I had to charge the remote control. It had enough juice in it and they asked me for my cable charger for the remote. I said it didn’t have one so I’m looking at what comes with the drone and found out I’m missing the adapter to charge the remote control and also the 3 filters. Anyway I can get those items? Otherwise it’s an amazing piece of craft!,4,1,2020-5-23,1,2,0
"This exceeded my expectations. The hardware and software are impeccable. The DJI Air 2 is solid, and you can feel the quality in the drone itself and in the controller. It's like if Apple made a drone. Image and video qualtiy is great, but the smaller CMOS sensor doesnt compare favorably to the Mavic Pro 2. Honestly, as a hobbyist, i dont miss it, but for professional photographers i can see the need to spend more for the upgraded camera. I highly recommend the Fly More package - there is nothing in the add-on set that you will not use. The addtional batteries all charge on the 3x charger bar, and it stows handily and compactly in the included high quality tote bag. You'll need your own screen device (cell phone, ipad, etc.).This drones weighs more than 250g, so it does need to be registered with the FAA. The whole registration process took me 10 minutes and cost $5 online -- it's no big thing.",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"This is my first drone and to say that I love it would be the understatement of the century. It's truly life-changing, as hollow and lame as that sounds. I'm an architectural photographer and having the ability to get up in the air with a camera even 20-feet above vehicles in a parking lot to get better photos for a client is fantastic. I went through the training and received my FAA commercial drone pilot's certificate and I highly recommend that. It is, of course, required if you'll be using your drone for commercial purposes. I knew that I would need to get that training in order to be able to charge clients for drone photos and I didn’t want to get a $2,000 drone right away since I had never had one or even flown one before.The camera is very good and the image-stabilization is excellent. Even in a fairly brisk wind, the photos are crisp. I did a little research on drones before buying this DJI Mavic Air 2 but I didn't know that it would end up being pretty much the hottest drone in the world. It doesn't have the best image quality compared to more expensive drones but for less than $1,000, it's impossible to beat the overall quality and ease of use, not to mention having maybe the best controller out there right now. I can't say enough good things about the Mavic Air 2. I seriously doubt if you'll be disappointed if you buy one. It will be a long time before I’ll need to upgrade to a more expensive drone.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,1,0
"You can't beat this value. Between the 4k 60fps videos and the 8k hyperlapse, I am blown away. The extra batteries keep me in the air longer and overall keeps the cost much lower than buying each thing seperatly.  Whether you're a hobbiest or a commercial pilot, new to drones or a seasoned vet, this drone has practically everything you need to get the best aerial shots. I've tested the RTH function and it works everytime. In my small rural town, I've gotten this to fly over 2 miles of farmland.  Don't forget to get FAA registered as a hobbiest or part 107 for commercial as this drone has the weight requirement needed.",5,1,2020-5-30,1,2,0
"The Mavic Air 2 has been the best COVID purchase.  My kids and I have owned ""toy"" drones in years past, but I really don't call those drones -- they were toys:  fun for a small area w/ no integrated camera.I've recorded incredible 4K video footage over large ravines and lakes.  Super smooth and professional looking stuff.  Now every time my kids and I see footage like this in a movie, we scream out, ""Drone!""",5,1,2020-7-22,1,1,0
"I'm really impressed with the Active Tracking mode on this drone. It can follow you around either by flying behind you or circling around you. This results in amazing videos.The video editing application is really easy to use as well, you can get videos edited right on your and saved with 1080p resolution (which is fine for my needs). Comes with a ton of cool free-to-use music to add to the videos!",5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"The Mavic Air 2 is a great drone. I have rarely made a purchase where the product both exceeded my expectations and has brought me so much joy. I upgraded from a $300 drone with no camera gimbal to the Mavic Air2 and it is like night and day.  The Mavic foldable design is extremely elegant such that the drone packs up small, yet feels sturdy and robust. The Air2 is very easy to fly and the camera takes great video. I love the battery life and flight range. It is also pre-programmed with a bunch of ""quick shots"" that allow you to select a subject and then execute some ""cinematic"" camera sweeps. The one thing I don't love is that the slate gray color can make it hard to spot at a distance, so I recommend getting a bright anticollision light and/or a higher contrast color skin to increase visibility.  Also make sure to get a big memory card for it so that it is not filling up all the time. Nothing worse than seeing something totally awesome in the drone camera view and then getting an SD card full error! The Fly More kit is definitely worth it in terms of getting the nice compact case and extra batteries. I have not had use for the ND filters yet.",5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
"Well this will likely be the best selling Drone for years to come. Drone does everything stated and exceptionally well. Super easy to fly and photos and videos are breathtaking. This Combo package is a must and has everything you'll need to fly and enjoy Droning all in one package. Of course DJI World Leader in Drones is why this is such a great Unit. Since its fairly new extra accessories are just starting to hit market but in few months there will be tons more. Range listed at 5-6 miles is not realistic for most fliers expect maybe 1 mile with typical interference stuff involved. Any further and you'd need to be up high and fly in wide open spaces but again everyone will be different. Definitely best investment made and super happy went for my first Real Drone 😃*** update now has more features such as Zoom and increased adjustment for videos, wicked ! ***",5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,1
"Today is, September 1st, 2020. I purchased the combo pack, June 2nd, 2020. I have used it 6 times, as of this post.First; It takes more than 3 hours to charge a battery and doesn't get a full charge.  Don't wake up in the morning and want to go out then realize you need to charge the batteries, because you'll be there til, noon. (If you have time to sit around and wait, no biggie.)You need to use the battery immediately because it starts draining, IMMEDIATELY. I charged them the night before and when I got to the location the next day, I noticed one had 89% charge. I didn't pay much attention, nor did I think of checking the others. After the next couple flights, I started realizing I was only getting about 15 mins of flight time. (Yes, I know, conditions, weather, temp, etc, affect the life, but this is different because it happens in all conditions.) I still didn't pay much attention.",1,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"Pros:  easy to use, small learning curve. Good video quality, gopd photo quality,, good range, good build quality, good looks.Cons: a ton of interferance when flying around areas with people or buildings or regular life stuff going on. 9 out of my first 10 flights all had issues with interference and the risk of crashing goes up very high from that.",4,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
Are you kidding me WOW!!!! BUY NOW!!! Thanks DJI!!!,5,1,2020-5-17,1,3,0
"When I opened the packaging, the first thing I noticed was the high quality.  I wanted to get flying as soon as possible, so I started charging the batteries and the controller right away.  However, I didn't bother to check the battery level of my phone, so I ended up having to wait for that to charge after everything else was already good to go.  BTW, the charging hub will accommodate three batteries, but will only charge one at a time.I had never spent more than $50 for a drone before, so I was a bit nervous about flying this the first time.  I took it to an open field, set everything up, hit the ""takeoff"" button, and it just hovered in place a few feet off the ground.  I played around with the controls and found that when you release the joystick, the drone will stop in place - no drifting.  After flying it around for a while, I hit the RTH button and it came back and landed in the same spot and orientation that it took off from.  I have not tested RTH with obstacles in the way yet, so I don't know how this will work.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0

If you're in the market for a drone then look no further this is the best drone for the money that DJI offers. I'm coming from a Mavic Pro and It's a step up. The Range on this drone is excellent. Picture quality and Videos are great. The only thing I don't is the Fly App from DJI. It's buggy and crashes somethings while in flight. I don't understand why DJI didn’t use the GO 4 app for such a great piece of hardware. Hopefully an update can fix this problem. I still love this Drone. Unless you have a MP2 you gotta get this drone.,4,1,2020-7-18,1,1,0
"I love this drone. Sold my Mavic mini & Spark to buy Mavic 2 Air. This one does what both my other drones together can do plus much better in the wind. Better camera, built in storage. The signal is much stronger and no breakups. Controller is also better at holding my phone while it charges it. Buttons are more intuitive & easy to adjust to. Auto gimbal rotate down to level with double tap is sweet. Cost more but does so much more Value is Top on this drone. I don’t miss my other drones.",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"Had the spark prior to this and this is better in every way. It took 3 batteries to get the same amount of flying as 1 with this. The fly more combo  is not really needed, but it does give you a lot for not much more.  If you are on a budget, get it by itself,  but if you can afford it get the fly more.",5,0,2020-5-17,1,2,0
"This drone is just the right weight for me, not too heavy but not too light like it’s made of pure plastic either. As far as size goes, it’s a little bit bigger than the Mavic Air which my brother has.It shoots 4k video up to 60 fps and 1080p up to 240 fps. The slow-mo footage I could capture is just freaking amazing. I honestly haven’t tested these as much as I wanted to due to the corona thing.",5,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"It's been a few years since I used my DJI Phantom 3. The software hasn't progressed much, and 2 of my 3 batteries came bricked, which is a ""known issue"" that requires contacting DJI for replacements, and apparently waiting weeks for said replacements.I'm going to return the entire thing, vs. mess around with DJI support, maybe will return for Mavic Air 3, but... DJI needs to do some more testing, and have their software developers join us in 2020. embarrassing.",3,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"I did a lot research before buying this drone. I think mavic air 2 is a perfect choice for beginners. The sensors around the drone really saved my drone from crashing for many times. Also, the flying distance of this drone is incredible, over 2000 meters without any problems. The camera is amazing, with 4k resolution filming function. Also highly recommend the dji care, which I believe offers free exchange of a new drone if anything happenens.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,1
"I'm writing this review to help you when you purchase this item. See if parts are missing, and you need to do this first, then pack it up and send it back and order another.  I did not do this, so when I'm ready to fly, and have everything unboxed and charged, then I can't charge the controller because the usb-c cable was missing.  The filters where missing too.  Maybe they hid them in a place I had not checked.  None of these are deal breakers, I just have to order the essential missing stuff and wait a day or two.  I am really looking forward to longer and further flights. I've had the phantom 2 and it had a very short transmission range and flight time.  It is also not so bulky.  Step one, check the box before assembling.",2,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"Drone expert here! Ive been flying drones for the past 8 years professionally and for fun and this drone is by far the top drone Ive ever own.

The drone has all kind of sensors to avoid crashes which is perfect to keep your investment alive. The flying time is crazy, I can fly the claimed time and I feel that even more. The set is pretty much all you need and with 3 batteries and the case, you are ready to fly one of the best drones out there now.",5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
best DJI drone i have ever flown. This thing flies sooo well under every conditions. 10KM ocusync 2.0 lets you fly to anywhere without breakage. I flew this thing 7 km away and signal still strong! picture quality is astonishing.,5,1,2020-5-24,1,1,0
Using this to record Corvette club events.  Had DJI Phantom 3 which was troublesome.  This Mavic Air 2 cost the same but features are awesome.  Way easier to fly without mishap.  Easy to carry around as it collapses.  Overexposes stills but easily fixed by adding relatively cheap filters.  Most times lands automatically within a foot of where it took off.  Will not take off in restricted areas and there are many more than you would think.  Phantom 3 did not restrict at all.  Many large parks are off limits to drones.  Not as easy to fly using ipad as the old Phantom.,5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"Just a fantastic drone. The video options, battery life and range far exceed much higher prices models. So easy to fly for a first time flier. The video options are excellent. The 4K 60 FPS is a thing of beauty. Setup and takeoff is simple. Once it's set up you can literally take this out of a backpack and get it flying in under a minute. Quickshots make it really easy to take some cool videos.",5,1,2020-5-25,1,1,0
"This is my first high-end drone and I had very high expectations, and they were all completely shattered. This little thing is amazing, the video quality is amazing, and its so easy and fun to fly.

"This is my first Drone ever, I love it. But disappointed that the flight times are not what they advertise. You'll be lucky to get 24 minutes on a fully 100% battery. So I docked a star on the rating for that.  The drone will force land itself when the battery gets too low. The batteries are intelligent, which is great, they will slightly discharge if they sit. But that also mean shorter flight times.Get the fly more combo, it's well worth it just for 2 extra batteries.",4,1,2020-6-18,1,1,0
"This is my first moderately expensive drone and I can’t say enough good things about it.  I have a background flying RC choppers and other inexpensive drones.

"This is by far my best drone I've ever used and I had many! This is arguably better than even its big brother DJI mavic pro or Mavic 2 because of the technology and quality built into it. Solid drone. Well built. Easy to use and very advanced. I wished it had the Facebook live or YouTube live feature that the previous mavic air had. Other than that. This drone feels like you can fly it forever! Excellent obstacle avoidance, active tracking, signal quality and camara quality. I would recommend this to anyone!! Don't even think twise!",5,1,2020-6-13,1,1,0
So I bought this (late July 2020) knowing the Air 2 reviews of late were saying not too as it was having issues updating or syncing the drone to the controller. I plugged in the batteries to the charger and downloaded the DJI app.Set up was pretty easy but I watched a 37 min video beforehand (highly recommend this) as it made everything I saw on my phone screen something I’ve already seen. Not much in the way of instructions came with the drone so the online videos helped a ton.,5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"I purchased this product on the recommendation of a friend who has been flying drones for a while.  He suggested that this product is equally suited to a new drone pilot as well as intermediate drone pilots.  The sensors and automated protections built into the product make it a breeze to fly.  The quality of pictures and video are amazing.  Its 4K video is spectacular.  In the short time that I have had it, I have run it through most if not all of the different shooting modes.  I can't wait to get this one out on the road for a road trip.  The small compact design packs all this power into a package that is easily brought along on any trip you take.  On a side note, I would recommend going with the ""Fly More"" package.  The value of the extra batteries alone almost justify the extra money for the package not even considering all of the other extras you get with the Fly More package.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"I purchased the Mavic Air 2 fly more combo kit and it is well worth the extra dollars spent!  Right away the drone was easy to unbox, setup and I had it flying/recording in 15 minutes.  There was no need to calibrate controller or even the drone's internal compass (like the Phantom 3 and Phantom 4 models I also own).  As I connected to the aircraft, there was an indicator for an update to the drone software which took only 3 minutes to download and install right from my cell phone to the drone through the controller!  DJI has come a long way to make installing new software a super easy process directly from cell phone connectivity through the controller to the aircraft.  I'm still experimenting with the MA2's camera/video recording features but I'm WAY IMPRESSED so far with the Hyperlapse and HDR photo capabilities.  The battery life is true to advertising, nice to have the three batteries with the fly more kit, but for me, I only used two of them for over an hours flight time for my requirements.  DJI shoots and scores BIG with MA2.",5,1,2020-5-23,1,1,0
What a great drone. I really like the Ocusync 2.0 technology. I moved up from the Mavic Mini and one the few things i didn't like was the signal loss in dense areas using Wifi. I trying flying the Mini in the neighborhood and barely got it outside the perimeter of the house when the signal interruptions started. Once it hovered about 200 feet from the house and the RC lost connection...Scary times. No such problems with this drone. First flight up i was able to easily maneuver about 2 miles from the house without any signal interruptions. I tested the RTH feature which i hadn't used much but it was spot on. In 3 attempts i'd say the drone was off by about an inch or so once. Otherwise it was really accurate with this feature. Most important are the camera/Video shots from this drone. it's truly amazing. I'd buy again in a heartbeat. I added a few pics. The one on the left is from the Mavic Mini and the one on the Right from the Mavic air 2. Both pics are without filters so i apologize because there overexposed but as you can see the Mavic Mini takes great pictures/Videos. It's a great starter drone but i'm more than satisfied with my upgrade to the Mavic Air. I'd definitely recommend it,5,1,2020-9-25,1,0,1
I didn't know what to expect. I had bought a few sub $100 drones and could never control them. This one files on its own and if it gets out of the field of control will return to its home (within a 6 foot area). I love it. Allows me to take pictures and make movies I never could before. Basically serves as a camara(person) a few feet in front or behind and gives me a perspective I could never gain in person. It is loud and requires at least a shotgun mike but the end product is amazing. I am used to using set cameras and so this allows me to get moving images with very little technical skill. I'm sure if you spend time with it you could do amazing things!,5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"When I bought this, I expected it to be decent and be able to take good pictures. When I got it I was amazed how easy it was to fly, how good the pictures were, and how stable this drone is in flight.

"This is a great package,  I bought a hard carrying case cause I travel a lot and wanted something to better protect my investment.  The bag is great for day hikes but not very protective.  The drone is great,  everything I've heard about DJI is spot on.  The controls are easy to learn and the safety sensors make it very hard to crash.  Not seeing the 34 min battery life but getting closer to 30 mins.  Overall this is a great drone that will last for years to come, looking forward to using it everywhere I travel.  Haven't used the ND filters yet but its nice that it comes with them when they are needed.",5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,1

"Starting with the ease of setup and the extremely fast learning curve (having never flown a drone before) and proceeding through virtually automatic video - this drone has to be the current LEADER in ""state-of-the-art"" performance for price point.  Hands down - the best you can buy under $1,000 (and better than many that are OVER $1,000)",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"Disappointing. I did a lot of research and watched a lot of videos. I thought this would be the perfect drone for me. However, I was completely surprised to find out that their software would not support my phone. I have a Moto G5 Plus. There is no Motorola phones on their list of compatible phones. I had to send it back disappointed that their software developers didn't include my phone in their programming. I called and the lady I talked to said that I could borrow a phone from someone or buy a new phone. I can't borrow a phone every time I want to fly a drone. I am not going to buy a phone for a drone. I guess I will need to buy from another manufacturer.",1,1,2020-7-7,1,1,0
"Product goes well above and beyond all expectations I had!  Excellent range, features, quality!One suggestion for DJI would be that the camera should have some basic crash protection, possibly a lightweight cage that prevents the camera from damage.  I lightly clipped a tree and it folded the right front blade arm and the drone nosedived into the ground (it was only 6' from the ground), which resulted in snapping the plastic mount for the camera.",5,1,2020-6-22,1,0,1
Have had a number of cheap drones and was never very successful with them. I decided to bite the bullet and try a good one and boy am I pleased! Came together well no real issues with setting it up. Had my first flight about an hour after it arrived. Nerve racking after those cheap ones but it is a dream to fly and it does all sorts of stuff i am anxious to learn! It will take awhile to utilize its full potential. Highly recommended.,5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0

This is my first drone and I was concerned about some of the activation issues I'd read about. I finally decided to go ahead and purchase this and I am very happy I did. I had no issues activating or setting up the drone. I was flying and taking pics and videos with no issues. I'd watched plenty of YouTube reviews (Dustin Dunnill's videos were the most helpful) so that definitely made the setup process much smoother. I'm very impressed with everything about the DJI Mavic Air 2 and have no regrets purchasing it.,5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
The drone was exciting to watch. It moved quickly and smoothly in the air. Turned in all directions as commanded and came home to the pad on its on when the battery was running low as it is designed to do. The videos are awesome to watch on our computer and  mobile devices. Small enough to carry in a compact canvas bag with all the additional necessities and extra batteries. I would recommend this drone to anyone who enjoys all types of aviation.,5,1,2020-8-8,1,1,0
I crashed my drone phantom 4 pro ran out of battery dropped like a rock. I was using 3rd party software lesson learned. This drone does everything. Coming from a phantom 4 pro. Amazing machine. Wish they put side sensors on it but no big deal. Epstein didn't kill him self. Great for beginners and veterans. Best bang for your buck.,5,1,2020-5-27,1,1,0

So don't be afraid and make this purchase. You would be disappointed.",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
I ordered a mavic pro platinum and I had some problems with the camera and I returned and bought this mavic air 2. I must say I am really satisfied with it so far. I have it 2 days now and I went through all 3 batteries twice to make sure everything is working. I did put a timer on and run one of the battery and I got 27 minutes down to 15% which it landed by itself. I am not able to test the range to see how far it will actually go and will update when I do that. I am no professional at photography but pictire quality is awesome.,5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0

It was good at first but after a couple of flights the remote started acting weird with a non stoppable beep so I tried to calibrate it and calibration wasn’t ending at all. I pressed for the drone to take off and the drone started to fly away without being under my command. I pressed the RTH button and it started to return just to start flying away again.

There are so many functions and features for taking video, some I still have yet to learn but flying around is fun and easy once you get used to everything.

"This is my first drone and I am mostly satisfied with it.  It is easy to learn to fly and has many automated modes to help you take great photos and video.  My one disappointment is the software.  The software crashes often and you are left with your drone hovering (hopefully) without any control until you restart the software and reconnect.  The last time I flew, the video link went dark.  I could still operate the drone but could not take photos or video.  I had to reboot both my phone and the drone to restore the camera.  I'm using an Android phone so maybe iPhones are more reliable.",4,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Absolutely love this drone. Beginner drone pilot and this one got me hooked. Incredible image quality, great control. Would love an easier setting control for gimbal delay (to create smoother video quality), but overall I cannot complain. Very happy with this purchase.

"I bought this for my husband as a gift, along with the Goggles so he could have an immersive experience, but the two products are not compatible.  My fault; the DJI Goggles page does mention that it does not work with the Mavic Sir 2 and a few others but I missed it.  Still, it was disappointment enough that we returned the whole thing and will wait for a compatible version to come out. The Mavic Air 2 itself works well and is the right weight and has all other features one would want in a drone, so giving it 4 stars.",4,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0

I highly recommend this aircraft.",5,1,2020-8-6,1,1,0
"The drone is a bit expensive but this bird is solid and well built. Sensors do work just perfect, just make sure you don't fly it in bad weather conditions. Otherwise, this Mavic Air 2 is a Rock Solid high tech drone. Great Job DJI.",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0

"This drone is one of the best you can buy around this price point, although it has some drawbacks it is still worth looking at.

This is a great all around drone. The pictures and videos are wonderful. Then after I got the nerve up flew it 2-3 miles away!! Still had great video feed.

After having to return the first room only after 4 days because it was unable to take commands from the controller I was issued a new drone so far this drone has worked perfectly but I must say the battery life is about half of what is advertised the distance is about 3/4 of what is advertised so do not expect to get anywhere near the battery life or the flight distance of this drone very overpriced for what you expect other than that it is good workmanship what I recommend the drone no not for the price,5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"This thing is AMAZING! Holds up in 30 mph winds. Stead shooting and really cool quickshots. It lacks obstacle avoidance and follow me/active track features, but I shave to imagine there were some necessary sacrifices to keep it under 250 grams, the weight at which one would have to register with the FAA. Propeller guards work great for indoor flying. Just be sure to enable payload mode when using the guards. DJI is a clear front-runner in the under $500 drone market (fly more combo is worth it). Incredible what it can do for the size.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0

Worked fine the first 3 days.  Now it's descending extreemly slow.  It took 25 percent battery and over 5 minutes to descend 400 feet.  it will descent fast and normal the first half of flight.  Flies normal and fast any other direction but down.  Had 3 percent battery when it finally touched down.  I had it land on our trampoline because I thought the battery was going to die and fall from the sky.  Last few flights have been the same(slow descent)  Went through all calibrations.  All the lenses are clean.  Not getting any warnings.  Extreemly slow descending no matter what mode it's in.  Propellers are in perfect shape.

I contacted customer service and the provide no options to fix, didn't even seem to ask any questions.  I was told to send the batteries back.  I asked for them to ship replacements right away, and they said they couldn't, but would ship as soon as they saw my return accepted at UPS.  Well, that turned out to be a lie.  After another hour waiting for customer service chat, I was told that they would receive them in 5-7 days, process them and then send me new ones.

At first the app was lacking a little bit but the previous update in August was a huge Improvement, battery meter and Battery information is very nice and 4x zoom was added to the camera which is really awesome. The only thing that I can complain about would be no obstacle avoidance sensor on the top or sides of the drone but for me it's really not that big of a deal. I've noticed a few reviews people putting this drone down obviously they don't know what they're doing and probably shouldn't be flying a drone in the first place this is a rock solid drone, if you crash it it's your fault not the drones.

"As someone who is an owner of the Mavic Air 2, but having bought it from the DJI store, I am not certain why there are so many bad reviews.. I read all the 1 star reviews and from what I saw it was EXCLUSIVELY complaints about software/firmware/app syncing, etc. These are all very easy to remedy with a little careful reading of the set up owners manual proceedure, or updating all the software/firmware.  The Mavic Air 2 batteries are VERY intelligent and have their own software/firmware to update. One of my batteries didn't work upon arrival but upon update it works. They also release new patches and features often so you need to stay on top of the local flight regulations, and restrictions where you are as it is intelligent enough to not let you even spin the props if you are too close to an airport or military installations (maybe others I'm still learning). Finally in addressing the app for your phone. I use an Android phone, and the only DJI application that will connect to your DJI Mavic Air 2 or the DJI Mavic Mini, is the 'DJI Fly' app. There are many DJI applications on the play store, but the DJI Fly app is the only one that works with those UAV. I'm not familiar enough with the error codes you guys mentioned, but I find there are a LOT of different levels of computers at work in this little aircraft and almost all, INCLUDING the batteries, need software updates to work!Cheers",5,0,2020-6-13,1,1,0
"I've purchased the DJI Mavic Air 2 drone almost 2 months ago and if not the best, it is one of the best one in that price range in the market today. I own several other DJI drone models and one big improvement over all other DJI drones, is the remote controller, which is easier to attach the cell phone, at the top of the remote, and you don't need to worry about the sticking antennas like the remotes on the other models.Several people complain about the lack of sensors on the side to avoid crashing it while operating it in follow me mode. Its crashing avoiding mechanism is ways better than the previous models, but it still has big room for improvement, if compared to Skydio 2 drone, which I think it is currently the reference in the market for the crashing avoidance technology used on drones.",4,0,2020-7-6,1,0,0

"I’ve flown many of my friends drones (including other DJI models and Parrot etc.). I’ve also been contemplating buying one for the last 18 months, and have probably done over 100 hours of total research. I went with this one, and let me tell you, it is darn near perfect for a drone/photography hobbyist, and maybe even some light professional work. The Mavic air 2 is the perfect balance of features, price, and practicality. It will shoot 4K @ 60fps or 4K HDR @ 30fps, and will literally fit in your pants pocket (although it wouldn’t be very comfortable). It also has rear, downward, and front collision avoidance along with DJI’s 3rd gen Control tech. You used to only be able to get these features on the pro models that cost almost double the price. If you’re a drone enthusiast that wants the latest/most future-proof tech, great product support and reliability, as well as enough camera power to do virtually anything other than make professional films, look no further. HUGE value for money proposition.",5,0,2020-6-15,1,0,0

"As my first time owning a drone I wasn’t sure what to expect. I ended up getting the fly more combo and I am very glad I did. You have too much fun and 3 batteries isn’t enough. I find myself going outside way more just to record random things and I am blown away by the quality of this drone. I get to see a different side of the world I never get to experience before. Also, flying the thing is too much fun. I realized after the first couple days I need to stop moving so much and take steady video because I kept flying it like a RC toy going and turning all over the place.",5,0,2020-6-2,1,1,0
This one will be hard to beat. Even the much more expensive Mavic 2 Pro does not have a huge advantage over this. Great RAW photos at both 12 MP and 48 MP with the Quad Bayer,5,0,2020-5-22,1,2,1
"This little drone is glorious. Folds up small and travels like a camera would in the bag but you have more than an hour and 20 mins of flight time across the 3 batteries. Very easy to fly, would let daughters or wife fly it (but haven’t yet). Love the quick picture and tracking modes. I’ve probably had mine in the air 6 hours since I got it for Father’s Day and haven’t crashed once, same set of propellers. This thing is like a flying professional quality camera, def a tool not a toy but it’s fun to fly it. Love love love it.",5,0,2020-6-26,1,0,0

Horrible you can't fly without a phone even though it has a remote. Works on almost No phones needs to be 64 bit. The $100 TELLO works with my LG 4 Stylo phone so you think for $800 you could use without a phone like my Potensic D85 drone but no. Also the DJI fly app isn't compatible with my phone. Doesn't cone with landing gear or propellor guards. Very delicate just waiting to break on first crash. Over priced rip off and DJI cust service sucks. You are paying for DJI name brand. Cheaper drones can do alot of the same things only cost less than $800.,1,0,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"This DJI product is awful in every regard. Doesn't function properly. And for all the money you pay it controls where you can fly or not. Driving 80 mph in a 50 mph zone is illegal, but cars don't prevent you from driving at 80 mph if you so want to. Apart from that fact, the quality of this product and the smartphone app is just awful. Low quality and doesn't function properly. Customer service is awful too.",1,0,2020-8-26,1,1,0

"I consider myself a beginner. I purchased my first drone back in November 2019, a Buggs B4. After a little time with it, I realized that I wanted something better. Long story short, this one came along and I bought it. As good as the picture quality is, I was more surprised at how much easier it was to fly than my first drone. I don't think I'll be purchasing another drone for a long time,",5,0,2020-7-8,1,0,0

Let me first say wait for a month or two until they work out all the bugs.  Mine won’t activate in the App so it’s a $1000 brick sitting there waiting for a response from DJI -This is a current known issue.  I repeat do not purchase.  Wait a while -,3,1,2020-5-19,1,2,0
"I hardly ever write reviews, but I feel compelled to write one for this product. I received a brand new Mavic Air 2 just a few days ago, and it has never taken off once. First, I had problems with the ""automatic pairing"". You have to pair the aircraft to the remote, and it supposed to be easy. Each time it would try to pair, it would fail, and then the backup pairing option would fail too. I tried it with my iPhone, an iPad, and another iPhone and not one of them worked! Then, I call their technical support and had to wait for an hour. Their technical support directed me to a third pairing option that did work. After finally pairing the remote to the aircraft, I thought ""great, we're ready to fly!"". NOPE! I kept getting an error that said ""IMU initializing. Retrieving IMU data. (Code: 30066)"". I searched online for the error code, and the forums suggested re calibrating the IMU and compass through the app. I went through the steps, and was able to recalibrate both successfully. It still did not clear the error code. Next, I started a Facebook chat with their technical support team. I would've called, but their support line is not available on the weekend. He asked me to do several things, and then suddenly stopped responding. I am now having to return the Air 2, since their technical support is trash. If you are thinking about getting one of their products, be prepared to fix any issues you have with it.",1,1,2020-5-23,1,2,0

"This is the first drone I’ve ever used, have had my eye on them for awhile but felt the tech just wasn’t there yet, till I saw the Mavic air 2. I have also not had the time to play with it as much as I’d like.. or more then 15 minutes at this point tbh. But from my limited time setting it up and playing with it, I freaking love it! Was not to hard to set up for the first time. A few updates and I had her in the air in no time. Not to hard to learn how to fly (being my first time) The camera on it is amazing, the DJI fly app seems to work well and be very user friendly. I bought it just to have abit if fun / film some outdoor activities, so the1600$  price tag was a bit more then I wanted to pay, but in my old age I have learnt you get what you pay for, and DJI seems to have proven me right again with this awesome little drone.",5,1,2020-6-1,0,2,0

"For a moderately expensive drone, I would think that the manufacturer would send something that works,, free of errors.  However apparently that’s not the business practice at DJI as their mavi air 2 and Mavic mini drones seem to have some sort of error that prevents the buyer from registering the zone (error code 0xffe).  When you search the internet for DJI customer support & this error code, you will find the DJI forum and find out this error dates back to 2019.  Furthermore customer service confirmed that this has been a long running error and they CAN NOT fix it, you have to RETURN the drone and have it replaced.  Unbelievable. While I salute the informative and kind customer service rep, I can’t believe that a company would let a k own issue go on this long without addressing it.What in the H is wrong with DJI for permitting this business practice...",1,1,2020-5-19,1,8,0

"How screwed up things have become this past year. You must be licenced to use this drone and you had better know all the rules and regulations otherwise expect to have Enforcement Officers from Transport Canada trying to track you don't if any of your footage ends up being noticed or someone complains. Trust me, I was just waiting on my advanced test but what would you know, a neighbour got a request for my contact info.  Thing is, I  was flying a Mavic Mini as had been a couple others. People are, rightfully, getting angry over the sound of a murder hornet hovering nearby, but hey, you can barely go high enough to not be noticed, and if you buy this drone you're going to want to go higher for the epic pictures you can get, but if you do, be willing to pay $1000 or more in fines if flying for personal use, every time you make a mistake or someone reports you. Turns out the app doesn't list all the no-fly zones either, as It shows me in a nice clear area with all warning layers on. It is wrong as directly across the street would put me within 1km of a helipad at a hospital, so that's a no go.Unless you're willing to do a ton of research  each and every time you want to fly, get your licence, notify ATC, and register your drone, Seriously reconsider.I know, it is stupid, this is many times safer than a mini, but it has more restrictions and needs a licence.",1,1,2020-6-30,0,1,0
