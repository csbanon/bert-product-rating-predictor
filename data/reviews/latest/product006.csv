"This cable looked great and worked great, right up until the point it tried to burn my house down. I noticed my iPhone was getting a bit warm where the cable connects to the lightning jack. So I unplugged it thinking it was just a glitch in the iphone’s charging system. I left the cable on the floor.When I came from work 8 hours later, I found the melted blob pictured. I have no doubt that if I had left the cable on a flammable surface it would have started a fire.",1,1,2018-6-11,1,2,1
"Was great. Then it wasn't. 3 months later, it stopped charging. No kinks, no tears. Still in mint condition, but won't charge. I have original apple cords that are fraying that I've taped up with electrical tape that still work 2 years later.So frustrated with these cords. I thought if I spent more it would last longer. Bought 2 and both are broken. Maybe if I collect enough of them I can macrame a plant hanger with them.",1,1,2017-11-17,1,1,1
I ordered this because the info indicated that this is an Apple Certified product. After 2 weeks of intermittent use (on a table in my living room) I got the dreaded “this accessory may not be supported” pop up. No worries... ish happens and I requested a replacement.  Received that today and I am getting the same pop up with the new cable. No other cable (both Apple and certified products) are doing this.  Add to this the fact that now I can only get an Amazon gift card as a refund.,1,1,2017-9-19,1,7,1
"I was very pleased with the quality of the product as I received it.  But after about one week of charging it became intermittent for a couple of days and then stopped working.  I think it is important to point out that this cord is in one location, I sit my phone on a table surface and let it charge all night.  So no moving, no using it while connected or such.  I also an not the type of person that unplugs it by pulling on the cored or such.  This just proved to me that they cord was either defective as received or poor quality (or maybe a combo of both).  Now it is much cheaper than an APPLE cord, but I would expect more.  Wish it would have done better....I had I hopes being an Amazon product!",1,1,2017-9-16,1,3,0
"Buyers beware! I had this cable for 5 days, last night phone was plugged in and I started to smell something like a burning plastic smell. I went to unplug the phone and the cable was EXTREMLY hot , hot enough to burn your hand when touching. When I went to unplug the cable from the phone I also received a shock from the end of the cable. Not suppose to happen!!",1,1,2017-5-31,1,8,0
"I needed a new lighting cord, especially a longer one (6 feet) so I bought this one in thoughts that the Nylon will make it last longer since that's the idea with nylon braided cables. At first sight and opening the package, it was seemed like it was good quality and it seemed like it was going to be promising but it actually doesn't work. I've plugged it into my charging block which came with my iPad and left it for an hour and when it was time to get up and go, I realized it only charged a couple percentages. Not too long after, it wouldn't even charge, nor would my phone even recognize that it was plugged in. I've used the regular iPhone charging block and nothing happened. I had to go back to using my old frayed cable for the mean time. I guess I just received a defective one?",1,1,2017-6-24,1,2,0
"I had high hopes for this lightning cable as the majority of the reviews were positive and mentioned that it didn't end up fraying after a short amount of time until it just stopped working or became unsafe to use. I use it with no problems for about 3 weeks, and then it started getting kind of temperamental about how the cable had to be positioned which made for some interesting solutions for charging my phone. Still, there was no obvious damage or fraying and the cord looked to be fine, so I continued to use it even if it was slightly annoying to sometimes have to spend some time finding the right position for the cable in order to charge my phone.About 3 1/2 weeks ago, I started noticing some obvious fraying of the braided cord near where it plugs into the iPhone and it inevitably became too temperamental to even bother using it to charge at all. I've now switched back to an Amazon Basics lightning cable and am hoping that one lasts longer than this one did.",2,1,2017-5-4,1,6,0
I am very disappointed with this purchase. I bought AmazonBasics chargers for each of my family members in December and in March several of the chargers have stopped working are are not recognized by any of our numerous Apple devices. It's not an overuse issue as the one charger just sits in my office at work rarely used.,1,1,2017-4-3,1,3,0

"I've bought a few of these and each one is terrible. The problem is that they don't attach securely. Looking at them it is not possible for me to see the difference, but it's there and I regret buying them at any price. I have a few Anker cables and those are much better",1,1,2017-8-18,1,8,0
"I purchased this cord mid-January of 2019. It’s now the beginning of April, 2019, and it won’t charge my phone unless I hold it a certain way.There’s no visible wear and tear on the cord itself... It still looks brand new.",2,1,2019-4-13,1,1,0
"I purchased this charging cord right after my original Apple charger had broke.  I had gone with Amazonbasics, as they had always been a good brand with solid products, but this products is NOT the case.  The first time I purchased this, the cord did not work when i plugged it in. NOT at all.  It would not even charge my phone a bit. So, still with a bit of hope, I returned the cord for a replacement, And when my replacement came, it worked pretty good for a while, but only a month after I purchased the same cord a second time, it broke on em and stopped working COMPLETELY. I plan to return this product immediately to get my money back and to buy a charger DIRECTLY from Apples website.  DO NOT buy this cheap, knock off, TERRIBLE charger.  Just go buy the original charger from Apple.",1,1,2019-10-8,1,2,0
"I purchased this charging cable 3 months ago. Normally I go through these cables faster than anyone would want to. With this cable, however, it has withstood all of my ""abuse"" to it and constant use of it. I originally wanted to buy a wireless charger for my iphone XR but decided to go with this charging cable instead since it was longer than the usual cable I buy. What a great choice. This cable still works great to this day, no stripping or fraying of wires, no delay in charging time ... just a great choice overall. If you're thinking about purchasing this cable.. JUST DO IT",5,1,2020-4-23,1,2,0
"I have several of these lightening charging cords and really liked the idea of the cord being nylon braided thinking that they would be better than rubber ones.  Initially the cords worked just fine, but after time the ligthening connector becomes loose.  When the connection is loose the charging will start and stop at will, and many times you will have to unplug and replug the cord into the iPhone/iPad for the charging to restart.  I have even got the error message stating that this product is not supported.  The cord that comes with the Apple product works just fine every time (but the downfall of the Apple cords have a tendency to fray after time.)  When will there be a cord that we can use for more than a few months at at time before replacement?",2,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"I started off loving this cord, heavy duty, durable, the long cord was amazing. I've been using this for almost a year and it still looks good. I have to move it left and right and plug it in and unplug it just to try and get it to charge. It's frustrating. This wasn't always a problem, but now it is.Update: 11/06/17 - I've changed my rating from a 1 star to a 5 star. It turns out that there was very compacted pocket lint in the charger port.  I used a toothpick to clean out the port and it alleviated the problem.",5,1,2017-10-20,1,4,0
"It charges fine while it's plugged in, but keeping it plugged in is a hardship. The lightning end doesn't seat tightly, so it's constantly falling out.If you charge your phone in a way that doesn't have the cable being moved or jostled at all this should be fine. If you're like me and charge your phone with it next to you in bed or while using it then this is not the cable for you. Every cable I've ever used, Apple brand, Anker, or others the connection is very tight when seated - tight enough that you can safely dangle your phone from it. That is not the case here. Even just picking the phone up from the table with no tension on it often results in the connector falling out. I'd suggest sticking with the real thing or opting for a quality third-party like Anker.",2,1,2018-4-20,1,2,0
I purchased this cable as a replacement for one of my stock apple cables that had worn out and I must say that I have been greatly impressed with it! The braided material of the cable gives it a more durable feel and seems to me that it will last for a decent amount of time. The actual plugs on either end are not overly large and thus are able to usually fit with most phone cases and USB charging bricks/hubs.One of the things that I really love is the customer service that you are able to receive for these cables. I purchased one of these cables previously and I had started having some issues with it. Once I contacted Amazon about the issue they sent me a new one free of charge and almost the next day!,5,1,2019-4-10,1,0,0
"This is the second time we've had an Amazon Basics lightning cable just stop working for no apparent reason. After the first time, I suspected it was the brand but we had had it for almost a year so tried to give the benefit of the doubt. Now I know for sure. We checked the outlet and other brands of cords still worked, we also checked it in multiple outlets, so it's definitely this lightning cable. Misleading too, because the cable would get plugged in, register momentarily (long enough for me to walk away assuming I was charging) and then just not work. VERY inconvenient when I was in a rush and grabbed what I assumed would be a fully charged device!",1,1,2019-8-22,1,2,0
"Got this to replace a similar ""braided"" iPhone charging wire that had become damage from abuse and neglect. It is long enough that I don't rip everything off the night stand while moving around and playing games on my phone while in bed. I've had no issues with the phone not picking it up or charging with it like some other replacement wires do. As with all of the Amazon Basics stuff it is well made and gets the job done. I'm looking forward to several years of hard abuse and neglect with this, and will replace it with the same when the time comes.  While this has nothing to do with performance, my coworkers often seek me out to use this to charge their own phones. ""Where's that long charging wire"" and ""I want to use it"" are the comments it receives most. My only suggestion would be to offer this in some bright non standard colors (safety orange, fluorescent pink, neon yellow or green) to both help me identify it as ""mine"" and to deter others from wanting to borrow it. Anyway, hope this review helps!",5,1,2018-11-23,1,1,0
"I came across this charging cable as a frustrated customer who seems to buy too many charging cables that only last a few weeks. I never want to spend the $30 on an Apple branded one because I feel like it’s not worth the money and the quality isn’t there with the Apple branded ones. I thought I’d give the Amazon Basics one a try because I’ve been surprised by the Amazon Basics products as the quality has always been really good with anything we have purchased. Long story short, I completely recommend this cable! This cable charges really fast, is durable and has lasted me already three months going strong. We have slowly been changing over all of our charging cables to the Amazon Basics branded ones.",5,1,2019-8-3,1,0,0
I prefer these AmazonBasic phone chargers over the Apple chargers because of the length and price. The first one I bought was in Rose Gold and I loved it but roughly 3 weeks after purchasing was noticing there was a short somewhere. A few days later it had stopped working all together. I quickly purchased a second one in dark gray (no rose gold were in stock) and haven't had any issues with this new one. I love these chargers a lot but couldn't give it 5 stars because of how quickly the first one went bad.,4,1,2018-10-1,1,4,0
"I first purchased a few of these cords in spring 2018.  I was looking for an option that wouldn't crack & subsequently break where the lightning connector and the cord meet, as this was the reason I had to replace many prior apple cords.  Success!  It NEVER broke on any of the 6 cords I purchased.  However, a few weeks ago the cords started to have connection problems - the phone not always recognizing the product.  I thought it was because I had an older phone and just shrugged it off.  Then a few weeks before Christmas I got a new phone, and the problem persisted.  The past 2 weeks all of the cords stopped connecting, can't even get a partial charge by holding the charger in place.  *sigh* I guess things don't last forever do they?  I'm not sure if this was expected to last even two years, but I am not rough with things, so I am a bit disappointed they didn't last longer than they did.  Ordered replacements, they should be here in a couple of days.",4,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"This is perfect if you don’t want to spend too much on the Apple branded cord. I’m always worried the cord that isn’t made by them will only work for a short amount of time, especially when they are inexpensive, but this has been working well for a while and seems very durable and always works This is perfect if you don’t want to spend too much on the Apple branded cord.

"I bought this on a recommendation from a friend. Although hers is not made by AmazonBasics. So far it is doing what it should. Feels strong and well made. Charges as it should. I like the varieties in colors. I bought the rose gold. I’m in love with it. Has theAmazonBasics logo on the side of the piece that goes into my iPhone. I have an 8 plus and works and fits great. I’ve had it for several weeks now. If there are any changes I’ll update this review. For now, I personally recommend this charger. PS I bought the 3 foot.",5,1,2019-7-20,1,2,0
"Usually I am really happy with what I get from Amazon Basics... This would not be one of those times. The charger looked perfect and worked perfect... For like a week... then things started going wrong with it. The phone would get really hot when it charged, It would suddenly say it was not supported by apple... and I would move the phone around it would stop and start charging with every small move I made. I did not have a fire hazard like some people, but I did wake up to it being Very hot because my arm fell against it in the night. Unplugged it and tried it in the morning... It gets super hot. Not Messing with it again. I got one from Staples that looks identical but actually works like it's supposed to for around the same price.",1,1,2019-5-17,1,2,0
"Yikes. Just saw the plethora of negative reviews. Seems they’ve all had theirs longer than I have, so I’ll update if necessary, but here’s the scoop so far:Does what it’s supposed to do! Plugs into my charging-box thing! Charges my phone at a normal speed (read: I am happy with the speed my phone charges, you may not be! Different strokes and all that!)! Doesn’t break! Looks nice (though I failed to consider how potentially weird a gray cord plugged into a white charging-box thing might look, but that’s not the cord’s fault!)!",5,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"This is one of the best chargers I’ve ever had! I purchased 2 of these to replace off-brand car chargers that had seen better days. As always, this shipped immediately and I had it in 2 days.Pros: color, this is a really nice gray - has a Velcro closure on it to keep cord together when you wind up the charger - you can remove the Velcro closure if desired (and put it back on!!) - it’s super sturdy and durable, this can withstand everyday use without seeing wear and tear quickly - the price was GREAT for the quality of the product -  **<opinion> maybe it’s just me, but this charged my phone at the same speed or faster as the standard Apple charger that comes with the phone** - the cord is somewhat stiff and not as flimsy as the standard charger, it can (mostly) hold a shape when bent",5,1,2019-9-5,1,0,0
"Since my wife and I travel often, I wanted a long cord for use in motels and other places where outlets are not always as close as you wish. And, the cord that came with my iPhone now stays in my car for use there.  I have purchased Amazon Basics products in the past and have always found them to be of good quality.  Well, we are traveling and the extra length of this cord has come in very handy on several occasions. The nylon braiding appears of high quality and long-lasting material.  I didn't grade the Durability because I've only had it about a month but believe it will last.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,1,0
"There is several reasons why I keep buying this cord, and brand! First off, I wanted something that was not flimsy and needed something that will hold up to some wear and tear, being in a pocket or a back pack. After some research, because I don't just purchase something without reading accurate reviews from people, I settled with this brand. Reasons being it is rugged looking and feeling, it comes wrapped up in a little flimsy type cardboard box, but who cares, the cord itself had this layer of braided nylon that gives it a little more extra help on the times it may be tugged on. They have a variety of options for length from 10ft to 3ft. I have bought several kinds of length and I have never had one issue as of yet, and it's been probably several years of having one to a few weeks to my newest one that I keep in each vehicle to charge and connect to my car's radio. It charges pretty quickly, so it's definitely holding up to its ""lightning"" charging capabilities. I would highly recommend this cord to anyone looking for a replacement.",5,1,2019-5-10,1,0,0
"It surely feels like it will hold up. Only time will tell. Maybe I should have given it to my teenage son for a REAL torture test! At any rate, if it fails in any way within a year, I'll update. It stays in my car so it will be exposed to temperature changes, uv rays, and non-ventilated flatulence.A year has passed and no update is necessary. Wait... what did I just do then?😳",5,1,2016-10-27,1,5,0
"This cable was good for some time but after about 4 months it broke. I sent amazon an email explaining the situation and the immediately responded saying they would send me another one without even having to send them back the broken cable.

"This works poorly in transferring data from my iPhone 7 to my 2015 Nissan Frontier. For example, transferring my iTunes from phone to truck via this cord gets stuck at 1 % transferred. I never had this or any other problems with the Havit cord I wore out over three years previously.  I’m going back to a new version of the Havit—but I probably won’t be buying it via Amazon.",1,1,2017-12-20,1,3,0
It was working great but on the tenth day the cable started to peel of a little on the charger side and eventually stopped working. I totally forgot about it to return and the 30-day return period crossed.,1,1,2017-9-23,1,3,0
"This is the only lightning cable I've ever used that hasn't worn down and continues to work. I've never gotten an incompatible accessory warning on my iPhone with this cable. This will be the only lightning cable I purchase from now on. I have taken this cable to Hawaii, to Thailand, all over the United states.....In checked bagged, in carry ons....This cord has held up through all of it. And continues to work perfectly. This cord has seen 4 iPhones....All of this use since May 2017..I think the people that have had negative things to say about this cable are probably the ones who have poor luck with phone cables in the first place. Some people just break and wear them out faster than others. This cable has lasted me forever. Amazon did an amazing job wit this cable. I will be buying more.",5,1,2017-12-15,1,2,0
I used to buy the older model amazon basics charger but one of the weaknesses of phone chargers in general is that  it starts breaking down and exposing the wires where the plastic sheeth meets the plastic male end. This charger however appears to be sturdier as it has a braided sheeth and where it meets the plastic it is thicker and has more rubber surrounding where it meets the male end. I bought 2 to replace failing chargers and will probably end up buying more for my family of iPhones.,5,1,2018-9-7,1,2,0
"I ordered these cables to see if they would last longer than the original cable that comes with the phone and they do.  The overall construction is better and pull points are more robust.  The apple cables will start to pull away near the end close to the lightning connection but these cables do not.  I ordered in 6 and 3 ft.  Our office employees all like them too,  highly recommend.  These cables are not as thin as the apple cable so if you are one who likes ultra thin and very pliable, they are thicker and more stiff hence the better construction.  I would highly recommend..",5,1,2019-2-18,1,1,0
"I bought this iPhone lightning cable from Amazon thinking it would be different but I am really dissatisfied with the purchase. After 100 charges, the lightinging connector was not getting snug contact with my iPhone.

I am wondering what is going to happen after prolonged use.",3,1,2017-6-11,1,2,0
"Lightening cable for the iPhone - pretty standard, definitely functions and charges my phone when I plug it in.  I've had it for almost 7 months, and it still works perfectly.  The braided cable is probably the best invention ever.  In addition to the wire being stronger this way, it doesn't knot up as easily and the stiffness keeps it more in place and out of the way.  Great product, definitely better than buying new Apple ones.",5,1,2018-1-12,1,1,0
"We've all experienced the infuriating splitting with the standard charging cords (even with just basic gentle use). I've been using my first nylon cord for over a year and there are not even any signs of damage. I've since purchased several more, and will never again so back to the basic cords. I've never had a problem with the AmazonBasics cords not working as they should.",5,1,2018-10-16,1,1,0
"If you're like me, despite your best efforts, your iphone charger probably just broke. Again if you're like me, you probably handled it with what any reasonable person would call care, and yet somehow, it's managed to be frayed beyond recognition and finally gave out a few hours ago.So now you're on the search for something stronger, you think to yourself you want to buy a better cable this time, not and not just something a little better, you want something MUCH STRONGER, it needs to be made out of metal and braided nylon so strong you could walk on it like a tightrope in your spare time!",1,1,2018-4-13,1,5,0
"Cord quality is sturdy. The cord would seemingly last until hell freezes over! But this sturdiness comes at a big price -- the cord kinks easily, is almost impossible to coil -- so this is the downside. I've read about problems with the lightning connector, but so far I haven't encountered any problems with it -- knock on wood. Frankly if I were buying another cord I would not buy this one.",3,1,2017-12-8,1,1,0
"Gotta say I'm a huge fan of Amazon and even their Amazon Basics stuff is made pretty well, but this cable has officially died on me. I bought this cable way back in May of this year. I bought it to leave at work, should I ever need to charge my phone there. I had used it occasionally and only just recently had I really noticed how slow it charged. With in the last couple of weeks I would plug my phone into charge for the ride home from work and realized that it hadn't really been charging at all. I've used it little over 10 times and it really only ever worked around 3 times early on. Now as I'm writing this review I have it plugged into my computer and still no luck. What a bummer.",1,1,2017-9-28,1,6,0

"I have never been more disappointed in a product, and this was the first time that I have ever been disappointed with Amazon. The cord only worked for a few days- if that. I received it Wednesday afternoon. Put in my car Thursday, and hooked my phone up to it Thursday and Friday. Did not notice if it was charging or not (because my phone was almost fully charged anyway) until Saturday, when my phone was almost dead, and my son was  in the middle of a severe ALLERGIC REACTION, and I was trying to talk to someone about what to do, and it went dead. It was not charging at all. I would return, but I do not want to go through the process for it. I am frustrated since I purposely picked the Amazon Basics brand thinking it would  be more reliable than other off brands. So not only did it not work, it was a very inconvenient time for it not to work.I know it was the cord- it hooks directly to the USB port, and when I got another cord, it charged my phone fine.",1,1,2018-3-5,1,4,0
"Purchased a number of these...usually last a few months before noticeable ‘burn’ marks. the Apple Store genius said the iPad ends all had signs of arcing, leading to ‘unsupported usb device’ error message and failure to charge.  In fact, the battery failed and the iPad replaced.  How much faulty cables contributed to this failure is unknown.The construction of mesh, wire and rubber strain relief is fine, connectors not.  Search for cables that last more than a few months continues.",1,1,2018-8-25,1,3,0
"I bought this charger for higher than the cost of most other chargers because I figured the nylon braiding would keep the cable from deteriorating and eventually breaking -- surprisingly, it still broke after only a little over a month of use! It showed no signs of wear, what I'm betting is that the braiding doesn't actually protect the cable -- just protects you from seeing it breaking down. Very disappointed, I'm tired of buying new chargers.",1,1,2017-8-3,1,4,0

"UPDATE: While I initially reported that I had some issues with this cable, I changed the charging block and that solved the problem. I don’t want to jinx myself but I’m going on 11 months with this cable without any issues.I placed my first order for Amazon Basics charging cables (standard white in 6 ft length) for my family’s Apple products in June 2016. They started failing in August 2017. I was happy with getting more than a year out of them, especially considering the price compared to genuine Apple products. So I ordered three more; two six foot and a ten foot. Both six foot failed within two months. Then I bought this one. I figured having a braided cable with reinforced plastic around the common point of failure, where the cable meets the adapter into the phone, would give better performance. Nope. I’ve had it two days and it has already done that thing where it cuts the charge off and on repeatedly.",4,1,2017-11-12,1,3,0
"Like many people, I have gone through a lot of these cords - they wear out too quickly. This is the third type of cord that is braided and more flexible. These tend to last longer and handle more being scrunched up and stuffed in cases than the other two I bought.This is an Amazon brand, ""AmazonBasics"". I am becoming more familiar with their product line and so far, have found it to be as good, if not better, than other name brands I have bought. Mostly, the quality is better and their prices are competitive.",5,1,2018-9-6,1,5,0

I have purchased cheap knock off cables before that actually don't work, or don't work reliably, so believe it or not it actually IS possible to screw up a cable haha.  These are wonderful.

My husband had other plans for it.

"I bought this cord in April 2019 and loved it until...last week my brand new iphone 11 Pro Max was almost ruined by it!  Started getting a message on my phone that liquid was detected in charging port.  My phone had not been anywhere close to water.  Also, it would not charge.  Started investigating.  Tried the Amazon cord on my iPad and it would not charge that either.  Looked on line and saw that dust or debris in charging port can trigger liquid error message.  I blew out the charging port and noticed that the end of the Amazon cable had dirt and like a greasy film all over it.  I tried another Apple cord and it came out of my phone with the same dirt and fuzz.  Cleaned off all of my Apple cords and thank goodness, they now work perfectly.  The last thing that I needed in a Pandemic is a phone that cannot charge.  I would not waste my money on this cord...it is not worth a possible ruin to an expensive iPhone!!",1,1,2020-5-5,1,2,0
"Broke after about 6 months and stopped charging.  Plus, the lightning connecter is so fat it wouldn't fit well in my case well.Bummed, because usually amazon basics are pretty well designed.",1,1,2017-12-9,1,1,0
This cable is very durable and feels well put together. There are some rubber reinforcements at both ends where these cables normally break and those add extra rigidity in that area. Overall i recommend these over the apple lightning cable and the amazon basics cable that isnt nylon braided.,5,1,2016-11-7,1,8,0
The cable braiding was top notch. Felt like it wouldn’t fray or fall apart like the Apple brand lightning cables do after a year. BUT the connection into the phone would never firmly stay in place. If I was driving with the phone sitting on my Spigen car mount the Amazon brand cable would fall out of the phone after a couple heavy bumps no matter how hard I pushed the jack in. I had bought 2 cords and both had this problem. I decided to replace with a brand I knew to be top notch  branding and didn’t fall out while driving.When I used the Amazon brand at home my phone would keep chiming that it was connected then it was disconnected. I just through both away and replaced with Anker brand for 5$ more.,1,1,2018-3-10,1,6,0
"I recently purchased my third one so I feel like I have a pretty good opinion formed. I love the length, and I like that it’s braided because it feels like it will last longer. However, it doesn’t actually last longer than any other lightning cable I’ve ever owned. I bought two at first, one for my wife and one for myself. Mine first started to short after about 3 months. I’m generally pretty hard on things so we both thought that it was probably just me being too rough with it. However, my wife’s started to short about a month later and she never breaks things like I do.  By the time hers shorted I had already purchased a replacement for mine.  If it had happened earlier I would have gone a different route. The Apple cables still last longer than anything else I’ve owned.  However, I like the length that you can get from a third party cable.  I thought this would finally be the cable to give me both length and longevity of use, but it disappointed like the rest. If you just want a long cable find a cheaper option and just replace them often, because this one will short on you almost just as fast and you’ll spend more money on it.",2,1,2018-5-3,1,4,0
"Do not buy this product!!!!  This is your fair warning.I charged my iPhone for the first time overnight with my new charger and when I woke up my phone was burning hot.  I immediately took it off the charger, but the damage was done.  Someone tried to call me and the phone was no longer able to accept incoming calls.  It could very slowly send and receive texts but only if they didn't have photos or GIFs.  It remained burning hot all day even when I wasn't using it and it was not on a charger.  The phone started losing battery percent ridiculously fast once off the charger.  When I tried to use my other charger that has never given me a problem, the phone started to get extremely hot again.  My neighbor used to work at the Apple Store so I took it over for him to look at.  He confirmed that the charger fried my phone and the reason it was so hot, even when not on the charger, is because the phone is working too hard to process even the simplest thing.  He said never to buy a charger for an iPhone except directly from Apple or this could happen.",1,1,2020-7-2,1,2,0
"The braiding on the cord is nice, however, the cord won't stay plugged into the phone so it's irrelevant how durable it is.I have been using them for a little over a month. I bought 3 different cords (two at 3 feet & one at 6 feet) and they all have the same defective issue. They work if you plug the cord in and don't touch the phone at all, however, any sort of movement of the phone causes the cord to fall out and stop charging. It makes them pointless if you plan on using the cords while walking around with the phone in a bag or if you are using the phone while charging.",1,1,2018-6-25,1,7,0
"These look like hi quality but don't be fooled.  If you see the ribbed part just before the plug. Well, thats the weakest point and.in no time (a few months) connection was getting real iffy unless cord was kept straight out the back!

"Having gone through three of Apple's power cables in the year since I bought my iPad due to the notoriously flimsy connector at the Lightning end of the cable, I came looking for *anything* with better construction. This cable is brilliant, plain and simple. The connections at both ends are designed to completely eliminate the flexing issue that causes Apple cables to separate from the business ends. and the braided nylon sheathing promises to make the entire cable last longer. Great design, low price. Way to go, Amazon!",5,1,2016-11-18,1,3,0

"Amazon CS will be hearing from me as well; however, buyer BEWARE. This device is exceedingly poorly made. When I removed the cord from my iPad charging port, the tip that covers the charging pins SNAPPED OFF and is now STUCK inside my iPad's charging port. I can't get it out, which means I will have to take my iPad in for repair in order to be able to use my charging port. I have two other cords like this that I bought for my children to use, and their use stops now.If I don't get my $ back, my decade + relationship with Amazon will be finished. I'm beyond livid that this POS Amazon Basics product is the reason I'll now have to incur money and time and travel costs to have my iPad port repaired.",1,1,2017-3-13,1,5,1
"I've been using this daily for several months and I love it. After going through a number of off brand and Apple cords that either stopped working or just broke, this was a pleasant surprise. I got the thickest one thinking it would be less likely to crack when bent or twisted. This probably isn't the cable for constant travel and needing to cramp it as small as possible since it doesn't fold or crease. It just works, holds its shape, and isn't going to fall apart.",5,1,2017-8-27,1,1,0
I noticed my OEM cords were looking a little beat and after Amazon basics has proven itself with batteries and other electronic peripherals I gave these a shot. I swear my phone charges faster! I also don't fear the dreaded kink or breakage right by the lightning plug as the braided cable is very sturdy and the connections are all reinforced.Really can't complain at all. They work great and the price is reasonable,5,1,2017-4-2,1,1,0
The size is perfect for when i'm charging my phone with a battery pack. Too short for charging in the wall for me. But great for on the go charging because its not too long. The wrapped cord is also a plus. I've had it for a year and haven't been trying to keep it nice. And it looks like how it did when i first purchased it. Hopefully it will last forever.,5,1,2017-6-25,1,1,0

Today, I noticed that the USB end of the cable wear it meets the power converter (I use the standard Apple block which came with the phone) was ridiculously hot and had patches of discoloration. I don’t mess with overheating electronics, so I’m throwing it away immediately. Hopefully my phone doesn’t have permanent damage; I’m just glad I noticed before my bedroom caught on fire. I’d definitely say you should avoid this product as I believe it poses a substantial risk for a fire.",1,1,2020-6-13,1,3,0
"Bought this because I kept going through charging cables in my car. I don't take the cables out of the car so they just sit and bake in the Florida sun all day, plus sometimes the cords got wrapped around my e-brake or gear shift. So usually after a few months or so, my cable would stop working (even if I treated it like gold it's entire lifespan) and I got tired of it.

"Worked great for 2 days.Over the years we have used several different brands of aftermarket chargers and cords for our iPads and iPhones. We always have the same problems.

"Like many others, I got these cables thinking more expensive and heavier duty... these should last longer.  I purchased the 3ft and 6ft cables in rose gold.  I seemed to have fared better than most, because my cables lasted just over a year before they stopped charging (right after the warranty expired wouldn't you know).  The cables are physically in great shape and show no signs of wear or fraying (see photo).  Seemed like a shame to throw out cables that still looked this good.I can not recommend as I've had better luck with the basic lightning cables.  I'm giving it three stars only because it outlasted the 1 year warranty.  For the extra cost, I was hoping for more durability.  If you want the look and find that a year of use is acceptable for the price, then you should be happy with these cables.  For my money, I'll stick with the basic lightning cables.",3,1,2017-10-1,1,4,1
This arrived right on time and the rose gold color looks exactly like it is shown online. I bought this to use for my iPhone 6s and it has worked great for me so far. I have learned how important it is to get a charger cable for my iPhone that is Apple MFi Certified because I bought one in the past that wasn't and it made my phone battery not last as long after being charged and then it completely stopped charging my phone at all after a few weeks. This charger from Amazon Basics has worked perfectly since I got it in the mail. It chargers my phone quickly and I got the 6 foot cable that works well when I need to use my phone while charging it. I like the color and the braided cord seems tougher than the normal iPhone cable. I would definitely recommend this product to anymore looking for a new iPhone cable.,5,1,2018-9-26,1,2,0

Other times, it will display the charging symbol but the battery life will not go up. Instead, it keeps it at a constant. For example, if my battery is at 76%, it will stay at 76% and not move at all even though it says that it is charging and has been charging for at least an hour.I had really great hopes for this charger because my roommate has the same exact one and really likes it.

"Pretty good quality cable. I’m notoriously (and usually unintentionally) rough on all my devices and accessories, so I often run into problems when things break prematurely. This cable lasted me almost exactly a year before I began experiencing the usual cable-only-works-when-you-hold-it-like-this problem, which began about a week ago for me. I keep my main phone cable connected to a power adaptor snaked up through my headboard (probably terribly unsafe, i know) and charge my phone in my bed, so it’s been through a year of tangles, awkward angles, twists, bends, and the like. The braided cord is definitely a good durability feature and keeps it intact as you bend & twist the cable with what I would consider everyday use.  I was, of course, disappointed when I witnessed the first signs of distress last week as my phone rapidly connected & disconnected from charge when I held my phone a certain way. However, checking back at when I placed the order for it, I saw that I had just passed the year mark and didn’t feel so bad about it.Good quality cable - it survived a year with me.

The ends are securely fastened with rubber like ends which blend into the colored metal house for the silver tone connectors (sorry, not sure of the technical terminology).

I feel like it’s getting to the point where I need to spend the extra money for a warranty or just stick with the original overpriced, not so durable Apple accessories.

A wonderful charging cable. Quality item.  Sturdy and well made. Would recommend to everyone.Update:  Have to take away 3 Stars.  It cost twice as much as any of my other cables and didn't last half the time.  After using it only about 2 dozen times (and never used the phone while it was plugged in) it suddenly quit charging. It was basically only used while doing IOS updates and back-ups.  I have no idea why.  No visible wear or damage to the cable.  Seems to be in the tip that goes in the phone.  It isn't dirty or worn and the phone still charges on all of my other cables.,2,1,2017-2-8,1,3,0

The rubber holding the cord at both ends is loose, somewhat tacky (sticky) and falling apart. It has however held up far better than the OEM ones and other non-braided cords. It helps that I have cords where ever I go, to reduce wear and tear. I have one at home, in the car, and one at work. The ones that don’t move around or get tossed into a bag are faring better.

Picked up the gray 6ft one last week. Was super excited plugged in my phone and come to find out it’s actually my phone acting up. Long as I have the charger in just right it charges. I have used this with the apple block, a laptop (ituns totally picked up the phone and was going to let my sync not all third party chargers will do this.) I used it on a tower and a portable charger. The laptop and tower both charged slower as normal and the iPhone charger and certified power charge that’s also rapid work perfect.

I love the length and the strength of the cord itself. However, whenever the newer charger is plugged into my phone, the phone goes crazy and does whatever it wants - scrolls, opens apps, likes and follows pages on social media... the old charger did the same, but only at the end of its life.

So far, these have really exceed my expectations.

I highly recommend this cord if you need a replacement charger for your iPhone or iPad but don’t want to pay a ridiculous amount for it.",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"As our family has a small ""fleet"" of iPhones, these cables have proven to be a decently-priced substitute for the OEM cable. The braided shielding provides durability, both in the car and (somewhat) against our lovable but sometimes destructive house cats. Charging is just as good as OEM, and the additional length adds to the usability. These have been our ""go to"" cables when we need a USB to Lightning cable.",5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
"I was looking for a decent braided charging cable since the ones that already come with new iPhone don't last that long either. I bought a pack of two to try them out. They worked great, then after 3 months later, it stopped charging. No kinks, no tears. Still in mint condition, but won't charge. I thought if I spent more it would last longer. Bought 2 and both are broken.",1,1,2019-3-12,1,1,0
"The material is great, much stronger and more durable than the actual Apple brand cables. Unfortunately, when I tried to use it in my car to both charge and play music, there was an incessant popping noise accompanying the audio. I thought it might just be an issue with the podcast I was listening to, but I switched back to my Apple cable (which, mind you, is almost completely disintegrated, a common problem with Apple cables) and the podcast played with perfect audio. I thought it might be an issue with the cable and my audio system, but my audio system is standard issue for my 2014 vehicle (not aftermarket). I’ve never had this issue with any other cable despite how much usb iPhone cables disintegrate. Seems like this product is fine enough for charging, but I would be weary using it for audio as well as data transfer (backing up your phone, transferring photos, etc). It seems like they skimped on reliable data transfer on this one. I bought two of them specifically for charging purposes only, but I bought another one meant to be used in the car, and I will likely be returning it as a result of its poor audio performance.",2,1,2018-10-10,1,1,0
Was the 6’ $12 plus beige cable was non functional within 3 weeks and not used frequently enough or abused in any way.  It was actually used a total of less than a dozen times and not moved from the i n wall plug more than 4 -5 times. Unfortunately  I was unable to process a return due to travel. However I did want to comment to save someone else from the same mistake I made. Amazon’s choice of vendors who supply substandard products with the cheapest materials and little to no quality control has driven me to web shop from individual merchants who’s sales volume and bottom line is heavily impacted by customer dissatisfaction and return business.This particular product had all the right looks and claims but I’ll shop elsewhere.  Plastic or nylon housing can cover up numerous manufacturingsins. So many ‘amazon’ products I’ve bought have this issue and I feel the responsibility for quality control among amazon ‘s choice of vendors and/or manufactured products (especially those with the amazon’s logo) is squarely amazon’s responsibility. My choice to use a lower case ‘a’ when mentioning amazon was purposeful ; not a typographical error.,1,1,2018-10-2,1,0,0
"We have been using amazon cables to charge our iPhones for many years. They usually break where the cable connects to the phone because it bends. But the last cable we just got delivered four days ago, worked until this morning when I started getting a non compatibility message as soon as I connect the cable. I also get the the charging sign on the iPhone, but it isn’t solid green.

"Pros: Seems like it won't fall apart easily and was the expected length. Charges fine and the phone doesn't complain it's not an official charger.Cons: It Won't. Stay. In. At all. If I so much as look at it the damn thing will come loose. The slightest movement and it will pop out, there's no chance to charge your device and use it at the same time. I'm pretty sure just receiving a message can pop it loose. And it's not my phone, my older chargers all still stay in just fine.",3,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0

I have been through several charger cables and have come across many issues in terms of compatibility and durability. Apple charger cables are NOT durable at all.

"This is my second or third USB cord purchase, always ordered the same one but never used in my MacBook Air USB port.  I plugged it in last week and immediately got an error message to unplug the device as it was using too much power.  Thinking it was due to the computer not being plugged into the power source, I reached down to grab the MacBook charger (Apple manufactured) when I noticed a burning smell.  The last thing I thought was the computer would be on fire, thought it was some neighbor burning their lunch.  After about a minute, I noticed my laptop was getting really warm on the side of the USB port.  I held it up to the AC to let it cool down, thinking it was just being used too long--again, it being on fire being the LAST thing on my mind.  It seemed to cool down but when I looked more closely, I saw orange sparks inside, finally realizing something had sparked in the USB port and the computer was literally going to melt.  I poured a tiny amount of water inside the USB port and it sizzled quiet as the sparks were put out.  Thankfully my computer still works!  The audio went out for a few hours but has since came back.  Scary to think what would have happened if I walked away while letting the devices charge.  USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN USING THIS PRODUCT IN THE MACBOOK!!",1,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"—02/26/19- After nearly a year of gaming use (Asphalt8) the Amazon charge cord has not only survived it’s actually better. Originally the cord was relatively stiff & cumbersome but with use has become pliable & malleable. It’s actually improved with use.The above applies to all four purchased.  —-Original Review———-I ordered the amazon basics charge cords a year ago (old version) the outer insulation was split & cracked in under two weeks, terrible! This new version is vastly improved and has already proven to be much more durable. The cord itself is a little stiff at first but that’s the trade off for increased durability.",5,1,2018-8-18,1,0,1
"Update: Purchased July 2017. It’s now December 2017. I’m counting down the days until the cord snaps. It’s similar to the Apple chargers that kink and break where it inserts by the phone. Cheap enough that I’ll probsbly buy another, but wish it lasted longer. Super cute rose gold color to match my phone! I like that it's braided, so I hope it will hold up longer than my original iPhone one. Very happy with my purchase! Changing from 5 stars to 3 stars.",3,1,2017-7-12,1,4,0

"Please please please, do not purchase this item. After three months of using this charging cable, my iphone shut off and wouldn't turn on. Apple ran a diagnostic that said my phone would never turn on again. Fortunately I had a backup phone that I used. Unfortunately - over the course of a month my second phone's battery was degrading rapidly. And then one day would never turn on. Apple ran the same diagnostic for the phone and told me the same thing - that it would never turn on again and that was in large part because the charging port was ruined (most likely by a faulty charger). My roommate used this charger and now her home button doesn't work. PLEASE DO NOT BUY - I had to buy myself a new phone I couldn't afford all because I didn't want to buy an expensive cable via Apple. It's better to just buy via Apple or your phone carrier because 1. this should never happen and 2. those are the only people who will help replace a phone they broke.",1,1,2018-10-11,1,2,0

I checked the cord and sure enough the wires were visible where the cord meets the little piece that goes into the phone.

When it comes to amazon basic products I probably buy iPhone cords the most. I finally just bit the bullet and bought the secure cord with the cover. I have had this product for several months and it is still like new. The length is amazing and is probably the best part. If you can go longer I would suggest that. I love the protective cover and it truly helps keep the inner cord safe. Also it works just as fast as an traditional apple iPhone cord that comes with the phone. The price can't be beat either!,5,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0
"This worked great for awhile, but has become one of those cords that requires jiggling and gets constant warnings about ""unsupported accessories"" whenever it's used. My iPhone 8 and my old 5s won't work with it at all and get only error messages. My son's 6s usually works eventually with the jiggling. He says he often gets the ""unsupported accessory"" message too, but somehow manages to get the phone to charge after a lot of finagling. Personally, I'd prefer to just plug in the phone and have it reliably charge rather than go through a whole process every time or, as has now happened twice, come back to a dead phone expecting a fully charged one, so I'm tossing this one and buying a different lightning cable.",2,1,2019-5-23,1,0,0
This is a very good cable and I use it as my main charger for my phone. It is great because I no longer have to huddle near the wall as I had to with my older shorter chargers. Also being a wrapped cable it lasts longer than the rubber ones that you get from apple and that's why I prefer these. My only complaint is it doesn't work when syncing your phone. It kept disconnecting while both in my desktop and laptop. If you get this keep your apple cable for syncing and updates.,4,1,2017-12-8,1,2,0
"The difference between high quality cords and cheaper ones is not merely the thickness or resilience of the cord itself.  Since the purpose of these cords is to connect a device to a power source, the way the lightning end plugs in is really the most important issue as a weak or unstable connection won’t ensure charging.  I was very disappointed about the fit of the lightning connector with my iPhone 6e; it requires a lot of jostling to ensure the phone is charging and the connection is very suspect to movement (which announces itself with a dinging effect each time the leads touch and are broken).  In comparison, the comparably priced cords at big box stores don’t usually have this problem (yes, cheap ones will - cannot use them at all).  So I’m just disappointed at the mostly unusable nature of this cord which was intended for my car and yet has been relegated to my bedroom for long, fixed charging only.",2,1,2018-4-10,1,2,0

"I have had this charger for about less than a year. So far, it has been absolutely amazing. In my family I am known as the ""charger destroyer"" because high quality chargers like the Apple ones will only last 2 months max for me. BUT this charger has lasted quite a long time. Its material prevents it from getting stuck in things. It hardly ever gets tangled either. It chargers relatedly fast considering I got it longer than a regular. I don't think the wire will ever split or rip. Also amazing quality for its price. It didn't stop working like most lower-priced chargers do. 10/10 would recommend",5,1,2019-12-15,1,2,0

"For everyone who wants a durable cable that won't fray and tear at the usual places, this one is for you.  Built like a tank!.  The cable itself is thicker and stiffer that what you get in most cables, but you'd be hard pressed, I think, to tear these up by yanking them around as most people do with their cables. My wife goes through one every 3 weeks, but she has been using the same one now for 6 weeks, and it looks like it did on day 1 - so it looks as though she has finally found one she can't destroy.  Regarding cases on our iPhones, the lightning connector fits in with no problem.  With other cables I've had to trim out the connector hole in the case to make the connector head fit, but the head on this one is sleek enough that it fits just fine on both cases on our phones, without interference.",5,1,2018-9-20,1,0,0
"I thought the price was a little steep for a charging cable, but the quality is just fantastic it totally justifies the price.  the cable itself has a bit of a flex and stay property, so you can bend it in one position and it kinda stays like that, but not too strongly which is very nice.  the ends where the cables meet the USB/lightening adapters is the first place normal cables break, and these have very nice rubber supports which will definitely extend the life of this cable. also one nice thing that isn't mentioned is that the cable comes with a nice Velcro cable wrap so you can bundle it together for traveling.",5,1,2018-2-3,1,1,0

I have had this cord for a few months and it has worked so well.  It charges quickly and I haven't had any difficulties with it.  I also love the longer length of the cord.

Now i just have one cable, I was afraid to try it because I don’t want to spend $12 for just one cable and have it break down in a couple of weeks. But after reading the reviews I decided to try it.

As another review said, it’s still in the condition I received it other than it looks like copper/metal on the actual charging piece has changed color in some places. I’m thinking the issue is that amazon is using a lower quality metal for the charging piece that wears out or in some other reviews catches fire. Not worth the risk for me and in future won’t be buying amazon branded products.",2,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0

"I absolutely hated this product and I was not expecting to because I have never had any issues before with Amazon Basics product but this one was poorly made. I had a 6ft lightning cord before  that I had purchased from Target that was great but after about a year frayed too  much at the ends and had exposed wires. I decided to purchase a replacement from amazon because I had purchased other amazon basic products like hdmi cables and never had an issue and oh boy do I regret this purchase. The cord looks good and durable however the usb part does not fit snugly into the plug. The usb plug I have is an apple plug but the cord comes out basically any time I lift up the phone. I have even had it connected to my computer's usb port and the same thing happens, the usb part is just a tiny bit too small so the slightest nudge on the other end of the cable causes it to come out. Nothing worse then spending an hour charging your phone only to realize its now dead because it was never charging at all.

I purchased the Nylon braided lightning to USB 6 foot charging cable for my teenager who is rough on recharging cables.  So far this one seems to be withstanding the test of a teenager.  Nylon braiding adds additional protection for the cable and the cable charges must faster than standard USB charging cables.  The six foot charging cable length is also a nice bonus.,4,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
Quality control is decreasing. I’ve ordered dozens of these cables over the years. They’re starting to fail faster and faster. It’s not in the strength of the cable. The braid is great and the head connection to the cable is great which is where all others usually fail. These are starting to fail with the gold coating on the teeth. It’s getting worn off on certain teeth over time creating an awful connection.,1,1,2018-7-23,1,1,0
"Charges the phone like it's supposed to, quickly and with a long cord. The braid is thick and sturdy enough that it's not fraying or breaking despite a lot of use in a house with a rambunctious cat who thinks it's a snake to murder the hell out of. The only downside is that the nylon braiding is so thick that it doesn't roll up as neatly as a plastic-y cord, so it's best to have a cord tie around to manage it when it's not in use.",4,1,2018-12-31,1,1,0

"On the surface, this cable is of decent quality. The outer sheath is very nice and does not fray too easily, and it looks good. However... I soon ran into problems when I went to plug my phone in. The cable had lots of give and wiggle once it was plugged in. At first, this was fine. Then as I used it, the wiggle caused it not to sit properly and so my phone would not always charge. This next issue might have had to do with the wall adapter (although I was using an Apple adapter with an iPhone). While using this cable, even though my phone said charging the battery slowly decreased until it was eventually dead.Would I recommend this cable? Probably not but it seems to be luck of the draw judging from the generally high reviews. So go for it.",3,1,2017-11-13,1,4,0

It’s the best cable on the market in my opinion.  Mine have lasted  as well..a long time far exceeding other cab;es in the past. One reason I believe it holds up so well is the longer ends and they are bendable and they are really well made.  Add to the beautiful color selection and you have the perfect cable.

I've been slowly switching out my regular Apple cords in favor of these braided cords because the Apple cords (either for the MacBook or iPhone) seem to fray and break near the joints.

I've only used this product for a couple of months but I really like it so far. The length is really nice and the cord seems quite durable.,4,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"This cord is awesome. I've always had issue with the Apple cord and the other AmazonBasic Lightning cable fraying near the lightning connector. It might be a little pricey but it is well worth it. It feels well built and it does not kink easily. Once you purchase a longer cable, you won't be able to go back to the shorter ones since it is just so much more convenient. This cable even comes with a little Amazon velcro strap so you can neatly store your cable when not in use.",5,1,2019-3-3,1,0,0
"I bought this charger based on the reviews. I needed something long (6ft), would charge fast, and was durable. Now I can't speak to durability except to say the cord is VERY thin, but I can say it's an acceptable length. Where it leaves me sorely disappointed is in its charging (YOU HAD ONE JOB). I plugged in my ipad at 8:16 pm and checked it again at 9:16: it had only charged 30%. My other cables charged way faster. I may be able to use this for my phone but it's useless for an ipad. I would recommend investing in something better.",3,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0

I've rolled them up, tossed them into bags and have taken them everywhere I go.  The 6ft length is perfect and now I can virtually walk around anywhere in my house with my phone charging...  and by anywhere, I mean the important areas:  the bed, the couch and the toilet.",5,1,2017-12-15,1,1,0
"So far I have had little to no issues with this charger (other than its length). However, it being shorter than I wanted is on me. It works very well for what it is, and strikes me as quite sturdy.

Overall I would highly recommend this charger if you need to get a charger for an iPhone, dare I say it’s better than the official Apple chargers.",5,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
"I’ve had this for more than a year and I’m very surprise how long it had lasted as I usually go through apple’s cords constantly. The wire is braided so you can trust the charging area won’t split open as the apple ones tend to do after several use. Really happy with these, I’ve bought a few more for my family members as well, all different colors which is easier to associate who wires are who. Definitely a well-made product!",5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"This lightning cable seems to do the job but after receiving it and reading other reviews, I’d steer clear.  Even if a small overall fraction of reviews indicate catastrophic failure, it’s too many for me.  Look around and you’re bound to find quality lightning cables that don’t have a tendency to melt or, even worse, burn up.  There may be more to those stories but for me, I’m a bit freaked out using this one.  I should have read more reviews before ordering.  Live and learn...",3,1,2019-1-22,1,0,0
"This charger is super durable and great quality. Amazon chargers are actually all I use now. My Apple chargers fall apart so quickly with how much I use them and take them with me. The amazon ones hold up extremely well. They are able to take on being in a purse, work bag and backpack - rolled up and unrolled. I’ll only be buying these chargers moving forward. Your money is actually well spent when you buy these.",5,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0

I bought the first one over a year ago and still works just as good as it did day one. I love the gray color and the nylon braiding. My original Apple charger has frayed towards the tip, most of the wires have severed, it's still charging but doesn't look safe and it probably won't last long. Not sure how as its the one that stays in the car and doesn't go through as much abuse as the in-home, but the nylon braiding seems more durable. I have no doubt it will withstand the life of my iPhone.",5,1,2017-8-26,1,0,0

After several different attempts by several different people, it was able to be removed; however, it damaged the connectors and now my iPad is unable to be charged.

I bought these for my brother since his iPhone charger cord was bent and the wire exposed. Still that boy was trying to use that fire hazard death trap. I got him these since the wire is covered by a braid and I like that it’s very bendable. If that makes sense. It’s like a string so I’m less worried about it wearing quick and another exposed wire. This particular cord is long so it’s a perfect length so he doesn’t have to have his extension cord right on his bed.I even bought me the pink shorter version of them.,5,1,2018-1-17,1,1,0
"This cord is a very nice alternative to the basic Apple charging cable.  It is more durable than the Apple cords.  It does work with my Apple products with no issues!  The only drawback is that the size is a bit short and I wish I had chosen the longer cord.  I will definitely order a second cord because of the need for longer size.  However, the gold color is very pretty and neutral.  It charges everything very quickly.  I have had zero issues!",5,1,2019-5-11,1,0,0
I love this nylon braided USB if you have an Apple product you know that buying cords are very difficult because half of them the apple does not recognize.

What I love most is the material this is made from. My car loves to chew cords and she got through the stock IPhone cable like butter. This one is much more durable and honestly I think she gave up haha.I also love the length!

"When I found myself in need of a new charger for my iPhone I of course went to Amazon. I found this Amazon basic charger in gold, which matches my phone color, and I thought OK that’s a good price that’ll do. Little did I know when I got it in, that this was the best, most beautiful, best bargain that I have gotten this year! The color and the materials are sturdy, it has this cute little wrap around it to keep it from getting punched up, and it fits my phone perfectly. Well done Amazon!",5,1,2018-8-28,1,0,0
"While it worked, I loved it - charged quickly, nice cord (matched my phone :) ), good length. However, it stopped working about 10 months after I got it.

I know charging cables stop working after a time, but this was faster than I expected for a braided cord. :(",3,1,2019-6-13,1,0,0

I love that there’s a small velcro strap that wraps up the cord. I love it.",5,1,2018-1-30,1,1,0
"I have no complaints. I got the 6ft cord and I absolutely love the length. I also really like the rose gold color. The charger works well, I haven’t gotten any “this accessory isn’t supported” pop ups. I saw some reviews of the charger catching on fire which concerned me, but I haven’t had that problem. I will say that I’ve noticed that my apple wall cube and my iphone both get very warm while I’m using the charger but that’s the extent of it. I’m overall very happy with this charger.UPDATE: I bought this charger on June 2nd, 2018. At the time of updating this, its May 11th, 2020. My charger finally stopped working today after just about 2 years. I’m super satisfied with the length of life for this charger.

"I really liked this cable and used it daily until today when it began to charge erratically and suddenly started to smolder and burn at the phone plug end.  Apparently the small wires inside the braid broke from flexion.  This was a frightening event as I was using it at the time.  Am glad it did not happen while charging in the middle of the night when it might have gone unnoticed until it caused a fire.  Purchased 5/10/18.  Used daily until 4/1/19.To be fair, it got a lot of use and a lot of bending at the point it failed.  Be careful to check cables and throw them out at the first sign of broken wires - though the intermittent charging was the first sign of a problem as the braided cover did not show damage.  I will give this three stars because I did get good use out of it over several months.",3,1,2019-4-1,1,0,0
"I’m updating my review bc im seeing a lot of bad reviews. To each their own but I personally don’t believe the negative reviews. I’ve always used this charger. When I had the iPhone 5 is when I discovered the “accesory not supported crap” and realized it messed the phone up. Since then, through my 6, 7, and 8, it’s been the only charger I even use anymore and never had a single issue. The ONLY apple approved product to buy. Favorite! The price is great so you should at least give it a try.",5,1,2018-5-17,1,0,0

"My wife got some cheaper braided lightning cables that had 3 in a pack and in a week, 1 was broken, the other was shorting out and only one was still reliable. I bought these shortly after she had hers and I think these are the best Lightning cords to buy. The reinforcement at the base of the connections make it almost impossible to kink unless you were trying hard to do so. The velcro string is a very good feature to keep it organized esp if you don't need the full length of the cord. Well worth the money. Now my wife has asked me to get her 2 of these. I will probably get myself another one for the office.",5,1,2017-5-8,1,1,0
"I use this cord for my battery pack, which gets thrown in my bag and suffers quite a bit of contortions.

Can't recommend enough!",5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0

Where, by now, the traditional Apple cord would’ve been in pieces, this cord held through traveling to India, and back, being crumpled into small places, bending, and so much more that I would not even dare do to the Apple version without it splitting. This was so durable! It’s also a gorgeous pink to boot. Length is lovely. And it has a bendy quality that I like. I use it all the time everywhere... I had to get another one!",5,1,2019-8-30,1,0,1
"Thank you AMAZON! Excellent quality and I love the fun colors. I got rose and it is a very light, soft pink. The attached velcro strap is very helpful and convenient for traveling with it.

For an example, I'd leave it on charge for a good hour without using my phone and the battery of my phone would increase to 2% or 3%. It came to the point where if I were to use my phone while charging, my battery would decrease instead of increase (I saw the numbers dropping with my own eyes).",1,1,2018-12-30,1,0,1
"Can’t be 100% sure but I think this cable ruined my battery. Shortly after I started using it my battery began to drain during the day super fast. Maximum capacity (found in battery health) went from 100% to 91% in about 2 months. I spoke with Apple support and tried several things to try and fix it (deleting apps, resetting network settings, ect) to no avail. I’m going to an Apple store this weekend to have the battery replaced. If it turns out the cord wasn’t the issue I’ll come back and update my review.",1,1,2018-9-6,1,0,0
"I keep this as an extra cable to carry with me. I wrap it around my charger and it's very easy to untangle and doesn't get caught often. It's also a very durable item and I've had it for a while now and it's barely damaged! It also charges well and has not given me any issues (i.e. Apple does not support this accessory). Overall, a good buy! Length is not too long, but it's just preference at that point.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"I wanted to love these cords. I’ve had amazon basics cords in the past and they worked fine but the last couple have not. I don’t know if this is a change on Apple end or Amazon. I decided to try the braided cord due to the good reviews but unfortunately I experienced the same issues as several other 1 star reviews. The cord worked great for a couple weeks, then intermittent charging, then nothing. I expect a cord to last longer than 3-4 weeks.",2,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"Connectors still fowl up after a few months Just like the genuine iPhone cables. These are built better. Yet if connectors on all cables keep fowling and oxidising or whatever, then it's a mute point for any cable wether oem or Amazon top. This hinders charging as connection is not always met. I have installed brand new lightening receiver in the iPhone as well.... so....??? All Apple lightning cables oem and generic are bound to fail after a few months. Has happened on numerous lightening cable devices iband others have owned.",2,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"I liked the cord for just about a month… Then it began not making a connection tight. I could no longer send it back. If I plug in my phone and leave it sitting and don’t touch it sometimes it charges  but if I pick it up the dinging starts, Which would mean it is not making a good connection I don’t think this cord is a good value keep looking.",1,1,2020-3-24,1,0,0
"READ THIS.After years of being an apple customer, I have found that the only company that makes good cords for Apple products is Amazon Basics. Even Apple falls short when it comes to cords. The Amazon Basics cords last forever and I’ve only been buying them ever since I ordered my first one. The only reason I’ve ever needed to order a new one is if I lose it, not because of breaking or damage. These are seriously the best, especially the nylon braided ones. Don’t get the plastic/rubber ones, get these.",5,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"Very sturdy feeling and durable. It is shorter than I expected (I ordered the 3 ft cable which is the same length as the Apple one I have) but it does it’s job and it’s very sleek looking! Will recommend to anyone seeing this review (:*update* so it’s now March of 2019 and I still use this charger!! No tears, no hassle to get it to work; nothing! This literally could never have been said about all the authentic iPhone chargers that you get with your iPhone and those are $29! So if you want a seriously great and long lasting charger that can handle anything, I highly endorse this!",5,1,2018-2-5,1,0,0
"The first of these charging cords that I ordered managed to fry itself in a few days, so I returned it, got a new one, and assumed that I just so happened to get a botched one.  However, the replacement cord has not fared much better.  After only a couple of months it broke such that it would only charge my phone if inserted with a particular side up (and wouldn't work on the other side), and now, less than 6 months later, it's doing the thing where it will only charge the phone if the cord itself is in a very specific position; heaven forbid you bump it even a little.Overall, I do not recommend this charging cord at all.  Buy yourself something better that will actually last.",2,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"I’ve had several Amazon Basics cables and they’ve worked great, but eventually they start breaking apart.

"Usually I would not spend this much for a non-Apple charger because they always stop working.  The overall reviews were positive for the product so I took the chance.  About a month after use, it stopped charging my devices just like all of these non-Apple chargers eventually do.  When it did work, it worked very well and I was extremely pleased.  My suggestion is go to the dollar store and get a charger because at least you won't spend so much on a defective charger. Don't waste your money on this.",1,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
"This cable has really held up from all the abuse that my 9 year old puts it through. I've never had the ""Incompatible accessory"" popup on her phone. Charging is as fast as the regular apple cable and the material of this cable is extremely durable and shows no signs of wear or unraveling. It's a great price especially compared to the official Apple branded ones. Highly recommended. Hope this was helpful!",5,1,2018-10-16,1,1,0
I have owned this charging cord for almost two years to the day. Purchased on 3/9/18. This is the best cord I have ever owned. Has gone thru 3 phones with me. Still charges like the day I got it in the mail. There is a little wear and tear on it. The cord cover is a fuzzy looking and the rubber end by the metal part is torn but still attached. It still charges with no problems. The internal wires are still protected. I take this cord with me everywhere. Daily it is rolled up and put in my purse. Since the wires are so protected it has no shorts even from this daily routine. I highly recommend this cord.,5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0

"Absolutely adorable color, also making it easy to tell it apart from our many other charging cords. I got a fairly long length, hoping to be lazy and stay in bed charging my phone half way across the room. I should have bought the longest length they had for my purposes, but I can still make it work.Quality of the cord is nice. Much harder for my cat to gnaw on. Was happy to replace my fraying cord that was becoming a hazard 😬",5,1,2019-3-15,1,0,0
"Much better quality than the apple charging cables that tend to break at their base. I first purchased one for myself because it was cheaper than the apple ones and I did not have to drive to a store and look for parking. Then I purchased (I think) more than dozen of all colors and lengths for our family of 4 with many devices because they work great.Revised review after 2 years of purchase: about half of our purchase is now in trash, stopped working. I’m now again buying the overpriced Apple chargers and cords because they’re always very reliable.",4,1,2018-7-21,1,0,0

Bought this in 11/25. On 2/15 it started acting up and not charging my iPhone 11 properly. It goes in and out. It charges for 1-5 secs then stops then starts again. So annoying. It does still charge my iPad Pro (1st gen). I only plug it in by my bed and it’s never shuffled around. No kids or pets bother it. It just stopped working correctly suddenly. Disappointed.,1,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
I have 3 of these and they work very well.  I bought the 3 foot for the car but also own 2 of the 6' ones which are a life changer.  No need to sit on top of the outlet with an inch of arm room.  I've had them for months with no sign of wear and tear or fraying at the plug ends like the white cords that come from apple.  And they're a pretty shimmery color.  Love these!,5,1,2019-4-25,1,0,0
I got this for my sisters bf when I ended up getting him as my Secret Santa. He had been saying he needed a charger for his car so I ordered the shortest one they had. He loved it! He said it works perfectly and that he loves the cord because it matches the inside of his car. Worked out great.,5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
I bought one and it overheats and my iPad would charge and not charge every few seconds. Amazon replaced it and the second one does the same. I know it is not the cube or the iPad because I tried it on a different device with the same results. Can not leave plugged in without supervision because it seems it could be a fire hazard. Just bought another one from a different seller.,1,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"I am one of those who buys a new charger every three months but this one has lasted me and it seems like it will last me some good years.

Good value for what you get.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"Honestly, I expected this cable to work just fine from the quality when I opened my mail. Nope. Did not work on my first, second, nor fifth attempt. I tried plugging it into my laptop, a wall charger, a portable charger, a car charger, NOTHING. It worked for a sec the following day so I decided to give it a chance, but when I looked back at my phone it had not charged. It actually went from 60% to 50% because I was playing music from my phone. Unbelievable. I took out my frayed cable that I was trying to replace with these and THAT worked better. Maybe I was sent a malfunctioning dud, but I would still not recommend this cable.",1,1,2017-8-30,1,1,0
"Have previously bought the cheap Amazon Basic chargers and had no issues until they developed the inevitable ""Turtleneck of Death"". Decided to try these based on reviews. Have had less than a week and I regret it.Order two (Grey and Gold), and both have started making the ""GUNG"" noise anytime the phones (a 7 and XR) thinks it's been moved or is moved. Have checked with other chargers and had no issue. These are basically garbage. The build would make you think they're durable, but looks are deceiving.",1,1,2019-3-9,1,1,0
"The end of this charger is thicker/bulkier than a real iPhone charger. So if you have a case like mine that fits an apple charger, but barely fits one of these bulkier amazon chargers, you have to force the Amazon charger through the case opening to get this to pass through. After doing that enough times (about 4 or 5 months), this is the ONLY charger that will work for my phone now. And it has to be positioned exactly right, or the phone won’t charge. The charging port on my phone is now ruined from using this bulkier charger.Tried to save a few bucks, trusted amazon, now I need a new phone. Spend the extra money on a real iPhone charger is my advice.",1,1,2018-12-21,1,0,0
So far I'm loving Amazon's version best. I'm tired of hunting for a GOOD QUALITY nylon braided charging cord and this is just right.,5,1,2017-5-20,1,6,1
Looks good and works well. What I don't like it that the cord is one of those braided stiff cords. I have other cords that are also braided and soft and last quite long.The stiff charging cords wires will kink and be more apt to break or fray inside the sheath and you'll never know it (upon visual inspection). But thought I'd try it since I like most Amazon products.,4,1,2019-2-27,1,0,0
"Since this is an Apple Certified product, the disclaimer message no longer appears on my screen when using another brand of USB cable.  It is sturdy and it charges quickly...very impressed with the speed of it!  Easy to plug in and stays secure in the ports.  I use it at my work desk and the 3 feet is perfect.  I've not had any issues with this cable.  Rose gold color is very pretty and the Velcro piece to roll up the cord is nice to have although it does detach sometimes.  It's easy to get it back onto the cord and use again.  I  love it and will be purchasing another one for home but most likely in the 6 feet range. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Great price, too.",5,1,2017-2-18,1,0,0
"Aside from being the perfect length, my favorite thing about this cord is that you can bend it to any shape you want.

This is not my first braided cable; however, this is the first one that has NOT come unraveled at the connection points.

Since I still haven't had any issues with the compatibility, it's safe to assume that it's most certainly MFI certified.

Great cables. I am in the process of replacing several Apple cables that are disintegrating due to UV. I can't see spending the money on the Apple equivalent when the Amazon Basics cables work just as well. The paracord style woven cord is really nice and distinctive and seems to offer better protection. The length (6') is a bit long for countertop top use but is useful on the couch or in my older truck which has no handsfree or limited sockets so I need to charge a phone in the backseat.The only problem is that the housing on the lightning end is a bit large for some iPhone cases.,5,1,2017-2-13,1,0,0

I use this cable to charge my phone on my nightstand so it gets used on a daily basis.Some reviews mentioned a problem with the contacts (i.e. device doesn't charge when you plug it in).  I actually have noticed that a few times (1% of use so far) but all it takes to resolve it is to remove & reinsert the plug.

"Don’t expect this charger to last, but you may get lucky and get a decent one sometimes.  I’ve bought them multiple times. The very first one I bought lasted about 8 months. But then every one after that has been starting to struggle after a few weeks. I get mad and say I won’t buy them again. Then when I go looking, the cheap price lures me in along with the fact that I got lucky with the first one, I buy another one in hopes that I’ll get another good one. I’m like an addict trying to chase that first high. Well Amazon. Well played..",2,1,2019-2-21,1,0,0
This cord started out great! I was pretty happy with it! It was only a few months in and the cord stops working. I checked to see if it was the plug our out lit but it was the cord. I was pretty bummed out because my last cord lated for a few years. In don't recommend this product be cause it dies way too fast. I say look for a different cord on that will last you a few years in stead of this one lasting only a few months.,2,1,2020-6-25,1,1,0
"This cable is great and is a strong upgrade from the stock cables. Fees really high quality with rubberized end pieces and braided cabling.

So far so good. I bought this and have been using it every day since. I have it at my desk at work. I have a little phone stand i purchased and plug my charging cable into my phone at the bottom of the stand.When not plugged in the cable seems to keep the shape it was in while plugged in. Just makes me question if the cable will wear out prematurely from staying bent. I could be totally wrong (which is why i gave it a good 4 star rating).,4,1,2018-7-18,1,0,0
I needed a durable cord that was long since my power outlets aren’t nearly by my seats or my bedside.

I had this charger as my daily charger for 1.5 years. It’s finally shorting out of me. Right under the charge port part I guess there’s a loose connection because it will go back and forth between charging and not charging.

I keep this cord by my bed, and my only issue with it is the velcro wrap to keep it together.

I just find it mildly annoying when it gets stuck to things or scratched against me skin. Im sure you could easily take it off though, its not that big of a deal.

It would have to be setting just right on a table or it would stop charging.  Then in that last month it quit completely and I have since ordered a replacement from a different company.

"I don't know how many times I have ordered cords in for my iPhone and the cord was too light to adequately charge the phone.  Not this cord!  Very heavy duty.  I do find the metal shielding a bit annoying and the cable is quite stiff.  All in all, hard to beat for the money so I gave it five stars!  Looks good in my car too.",5,1,2019-1-9,1,0,0
I gave it 5 stars for length because it is the most 6 feet of 6 feet charging cable possible!  Other than that it works smoothly with my iPhone - haven't gotten any compatibility device warnings - and charges just as fast as regular Apple cables.,4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"I love these charging cables! We have 4 of them and they all work great! We have had them for about 9 months now, no issues with them at all. The regular white nonbraided ones don’t last near as long as these. I bought one of those in the amazon basic brand, and I think it lasted 4-5 weeks before spilting at the end like most do. Well worth the couple extra dollars for this one.",5,1,2018-9-6,1,0,0

"I overlooked the comments because of the high number of reviews and it being very affordable. My cable arrived quickly and after about a month of use it begins to give. For example, the “accessory is not supported,” alert action comes up and the charge goes in and out. A bit disappointed but also didn’t expect much. I’m looking for a reliable Lightening cable.",3,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
Purchased one for me then got them for the whole family. Even have one in my travel bag. Great long cord for reading while charging.

Great for waiting rooms too when you need a charge and the outlet is not so close.,5,1,2019-2-17,1,0,0
"For the first month, this charging cord worked perfectly well. But now I am noticing it only charges my iPhone sporadically depending on the position of the cord. It may be the internal wiring wore down as time went by. Would not buy this product again.",2,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"So far, works great. Time will have to tell if this is really worth the few extra dollars over a 'standard' plastic cable but I got tired of cables, even certified ones, getting broken or just stop working so this time I invested in a more expensive, hopefully better built cable.

I really liked this at first.  I bought it for the hospital after having a baby and it worked great for the first few months.  It quit working now though.  My phone still charges with an Apple brand charger but it will only charge about 10-50% with this charger.  Disappointed.,2,1,2019-9-5,1,0,0

These actually hold up better overtime, and are reinforced right by the charging connector so the infamous fraying doesn’t occur. 6ft is a great length too, I can plug it in right next to my bed and not have to use my phone at an odd angle. 10/10 would recommend to anyone",5,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0

"My cats have tried to eat this many times. I do feed them, so I don't get why they need to eat all my cords, but it has held up wonderfully.

"I love the length, material, and durability of this cable! Unfortunately, mine is only charging when plugged in with one side of the end facing up; when it is reversed my iPhone 8 either does not charge or says ""This accessory may not be supported"" and does not charge.

This seems like it is decent quality but it keeps falling out of my iPhone 7 both with a minimalist Apple case and without a case at all.  I bought it to use in the car so its pretty much worthless for this purpose.  It would be ok if you want it sitting on a desk just to charge but not if you plan on using it while charging.  I will be returning this item.,2,1,2019-1-29,1,0,0

I loved this but realized it charged super slowly and now I’ve been shocked twice in the last week.

It hurt so much I involuntarily ripped the cord and my phone out of the wall and threw them.,1,1,2019-4-7,1,0,0
"This cord had pot performed many I have purchased previously. I must say, it must be the material. The length is awesome because it’s just enough to still use my phone if needed.

"These are fantastic cords.  Since I've use it, its held up to wear and tear and lots of use.  The connections are strong and the materials are great quality.

"I still use this cable that I bought over 14 months ago and it still looks like new. I used to have to replace my old cables so often, so I decided to spend the extra couple of dollars and get the braided one. It has been an amazing purchase and well worth the few dollars more. I would highly recommend this if you go through cables really quickly. Also, a 6-foot cable may seem long but you will appreciate the extra length more than you would think.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
"This charger was great for a very brief time. The length is excellent and the reinforced outer covering feels very well made, however its internal durability leaves a lot to be desired. I bought it only 25 days ago and it has already stopped consistently charging my phone. The power to my phone now constantly cuts out when charging the phone as if someone was unplugging and replugging it in. Although it might be more expensive, an actual Apple charger is probably the best way to go to save you headaches over buying questionable products like this.",1,1,2020-3-29,1,0,0
I haven’t had this charger long but I noticed it gets really hot at the base and it makes my phone get hot so I’m really worried about using it now. I’m concerned it’s made my phone battery hold a charge less or that it could even start a fire.,1,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0

"I've bought several of these cords in silver, rose gold and gold. They last longer than OEM versions and are more stylish. Amazon really did their homework. The cord works just as well if not better than my factory cord. It's reinforced on both ends which prevent the bending and breaking issue. The braided cord also is more durable. I bought our first over a year ago and liked it so much bought more for the rest our home. We have one in every room. The colors are great because we have a cord to match our phones. Honestly can't recommend these enough.",5,1,2018-10-15,1,0,0

"I purchased this cable to charge my iPhone 6. From the start it was erratic. I had to slightly rock the input connection in order to maintain charging. I did this for a couple of months until I figured out that the cord was not good for the phone.

This product has a shelf life. It surely lived a full life with me for about a year or so. It traveled to many places and got its full use. The usb side and the side that clicks into my iPhone started to fall apart a lot. The length is a real game changer for someone who hasn’t had a cord this length,3,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
Had such high hopes. I really thought this material would mean I wouldn’t have to keep replacing my iPhone Chargers. Bought it in May and it’s already having issues where if I move my phone at all it buzzes and stops charging but if I move it ever so slightly again it’ll go back to charging. Great product if you can charge your phone in one spot and not touch it until it’s charged.,1,1,2018-9-7,1,0,0

I needed a charger for my car that wouldn't melt in heat and wasn't too long or short. This has been great. It charges my phone at a comparable speed to the official iPhone chargers and has a much higher quality material. I haven't noticed any fraying or separating. It plugs in easily to both the USB and iPhone. I will buy again when I need another charger.,5,1,2018-9-13,1,0,0

I will definitely be buying more of these in the future.",5,1,2017-8-29,1,1,0
I have been very happy with this charging cord.  Its much more durable than the Apple brand cord.  It comes with a little Velcro strap so that you can wrap the cord neatly when you're not using it.

Not that it's the end of the world that I have to either unplug to unlock my device or type in my passcode, but a genuine Apple Lightning Cable does not have this issue, and I would have expected better from a ""MFi certified"" cable.",2,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0

"By far the best lightning cables I own, I've purchased several of these. I recommend the 6ft over the 3ft due to versatility and overall value. I have USB outlets at home, and the 6ft reaches nicely for when you're on the couch. In the office, the 6ft cable leaves slack on my desk from the plugs in the surge protectors on the floor under my desk. My girlfriend also left the cable hanging out the car dorr as we drove, and although scuffed up quite a bit, the robust, well-made cable still works. I don't give 5-stars easily, but this cable is 5+.If you have Apple devices, buy the 10-pack. You'll find uses for them, and you'll never be searching again.",5,1,2018-6-7,1,0,0

Disappointing. Absolutely loved this for the first 6 weeks. Was able to reach the entire length of couch or reach further than any other cord. After about a month and a half if just doesn’t charge sometimes. You can mess with it enough to start working but not worth keeping if it won’t work long term. Wouldn’t recommend just because you’ll need to replace so quickly.,2,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0

This cord has held up to daily use without coming apart at the cord/charger connection point. I’ve tried several different types and none of the others lasted more than a month or two. I am very happy that this one still looks brand new after months of using it .,5,1,2019-6-8,1,0,0

"This charger worked great for 4 months, it was durable & I would give physical aspects of the cord five stars. For reference, this cord is used usually once daily. However,I’ve had this charger for 5 months & around month 4 it only let me charge my phone using a specific side of the pin adapter, for example it will only charge my phone if the amazon basics brand side is facing the screen side of the phone but not the other way around. Still charges on the side it likes very quickly so I can’t say this is a bad buy, it just might not last as long as one would want. 3 stars only for the short shelf life.",3,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0

No physical deterioration or other signs that it wouldn't be working.There's supposed to be a limited warranty (1 year), so I'm hoping maybe I can get a replacement?

"It’s pretty great. I bought this product in 2018 and it still works now. That may not seem that long, but it’s still more than half price of what apple charges and would probably last around the same time.

In my opinion it has lasted a while now and that’s the main thing I’m looking for. Most of my apple chargers’ life span are just getting shorter and shorter.

It also comes with a Velcro strap for clean looking storage. Over time it does tend to come off if pulled hard but goes right back on. Velcro isn’t as strong as it was at first but in fairness I use it a lot and still works good. Been using them for over 6 months.",5,1,2019-8-21,1,0,1

At 6 feet the length alone is reason enough to buy it, but add in the reinforced ends and braided nylon cord and I'd rate it much better than the original/replacement cords from Apple.

Its about to be 2 years since I’ve bought this charger and now is when it’s reaching it’s end time. Still charges but it flickers on and off. So I’m about to buy another one to replace it. If you leave your phone alone while charging (like I believe you should do but we’re addicts so we use while charging) it charges fine. Best long lasting charger I’ve had so far,5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
I don't know why some people complain about this charging cord. I found this product very good quality based on its price and so far it is good after 3 weeks. I hope it will do the same for a longer period of time.,5,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
This was working fine but has decided to suddenly stop working less that 6 months later. Super frustrating because I’m currently on an island and now I have a broken charging cord. *sigh*,1,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"I am so happy with this charger.  The cording is sturdy and has extra protection around the plugs (USB), both going into the phone and the adapter.  My Apple chargers seem to crack in these areas.  The charger works well and keeps my iPhone and iPad charged well in a short time.",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
This cable worked beautifully with and iPhone 5s connected to a cigarette lighter adapter for a car.  I think the braided cables are the way to go because eventually the non-braided ones crack and break at the connection.  I have never had any trouble with a braided cable as yet.,5,1,2017-12-18,1,1,0
"I ordered this because I own an IPhone and go through chargers like toilet paper. This is actually one of the worst chargers I've ever used and I once had a charger that fell apart on day3. This charger has had a connection issue since the minute I plugged it in. It's only actually charging 80% of the time but I get the stupid ""plugged in"" sound continuously. iPhone users will know what I'm talking about, you know when your charger is starting to die on you and you hear the dreaded death song. This charger has been singing to me since day one. I paid $14 for this and I spend most of my plugged in time, trying not to throw my phone.",1,1,2017-9-16,1,1,0
"Finally! A power cord that holds up to daily use. I use it to charge my iPad nightly. The cord gets pulled and yanked A LOT, pand I’m ecstatic to report the cord looks and works like it’s brand new!",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
We've gone thru multiple cable chargers within the past year or two and we decided it was about time to buy something more sturdier and longer lasting. With the Nylon braids it really helps keep its strength especially when you're not being mindful like me and tend to just tug the wire off the adapter. There are many factors that leads to the wire wearing out that sometimes isn't in our control either. This one is so sturdy and totally worth the price you are paying for!,5,1,2017-5-14,1,1,0
"I’ve had this lightning cord for several months now, and it truly was a great purchase. It lives in my purse, and has saved me many times when I’ve been at work with a dying phone. It’s very sturdy, and doesn’t feel like it could break easily like some other lightning cables I’ve had in the past. It was a great price too. Another small but nice detail is that the cord comes with a little Velcro piece attached to it, so it’s easy to neatly store your cable when it’s not in use. Would definitely recommend this cable.",5,1,2019-2-22,1,0,0
"Your product of the six feet gold Iphone 7 plus charger is not up to par with my expectations. This charger is unable to provide me with a fast battery renewal in my times of need. Although it works, the paste that it charges my phone at is extremely useless unless I am charging my phone overnight. Which according to the Apple Corporation is not recommended. The charger is most definitely not deserving of  5 stars but 3. I hope you can improve on this product so it could be more reliable in the future. This was not worth the price of 13 dollars and 98 cents. I hope this is helpful to your company.",3,1,2018-9-18,1,0,0
"I love having a long cord, but I have definitely experienced some issue with charging. For example, sometimes I need to unplug the cord, switch the usb converter, fuss around with it a bit. But all in all, it’s a nice cord. The length is amazing and I like the color.",4,1,2019-7-6,1,0,0
Color looks exactly like the photo. The length is long long long. I bought one for work and home by my bed and my battery is now never low! The hardest part about charging your phone at night is putting it down and now I don’t have to :),5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
I recently got a side table that has a USB plug next to my bed. This cord is perfect with it. I flip around (away from the side table side of the bed) and still be on my phone. It charges very quickly and is extremely durable (compared to normal Apple cords),5,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0
I’ve been very impressed with this cord. I bought it a while ago and it still is in great shape. It doesn’t fast charge but it meets my needs. Highly recommend this for a sturdy cord.,5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"Out of the box it felt like this was going to be a great addition to my room because of the braided cord and the length, this cable has never been able to charge my phone. At the beginning i thought it was just my phone but it never worked with my friends phones either. So maybe it was the outlet? Nope, i tried all the outlets in my home, didn’t work. So maybe it was the usb box? Nope, i have about ten and none of them worked. Guess it’s what i get for buying a cheap cable. Thanks amazon",1,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"This is a nice looking, long cord. I can’t give it 5 stars because the head is too big for my phone case. All of the Apple chargers fit my phone case but this one, as well as most non Apple cords, do not.

This is the second time I’ve purchased the Amazon Basics nylon braided lightning cable. The first cable worked well for a few months and then became difficult to connect. I would plug it into my iPad and find later that connection hadn’t been made and the device had not charged. I ordered a new cable recently and the new cable hasn’t connected well right out of the box. The charging light on the device will flash rapidly. I’ve gone bAck to using Apple cables that came with my devices.,1,1,2019-4-23,1,0,0
"I had this charging cable less than two months and it broke off in my iPad requiring a trip to the Apple store for repair. Fortunately, Apple was able to remove the broken piece and the charging port was not damaged. Very disappointed in the quality of this item.",1,1,2019-6-24,1,0,1
These are our favorite phone cords! They always work (not like other brands that quit after a month) and they upload very well. I think they are better than the apple brand charging cords. I love the different sizes you can order. I have 3 different sizes (for different reasons) and all have been GREAT!! Will never buy another brand.,5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"After using this for months, it's still going strong. I've had so many cables short out on me over the past decade that I've switched to these heavier duty braided cables. So far, I haven't had one go bad -- including the AmazonBasics versions.",5,1,2019-4-30,1,0,0
This is my second purchase of this style of charge cord.  I like the material much better than the standard rubber charge cord material from Amazon Basics.  Both rubber traditional chargers I purchased previously have separated at the transition where the cord meets the phone lightning piece and I had to bind with electrical tape; this nylon cord is much more durable and I have had no separation issues with it.,5,1,2018-8-2,1,0,0
"These charging cables are the real deal. They charge my phone so much faster and are way more durable. We have replaced all of our cords with these. Great buy. Also 3ft. are the same size as the Apple cords, 6ft. is great if you need more distance.",5,1,2019-4-14,1,0,0

"I have been so aggravated at buying iPhone cables, cheap to very expensive with the same results, always coming apart at the ends,  not so with this cable.  The covered end points have not budged or bent yet.  The length is also perfect.  I have purchased another one for my car.  If you are tired of throwing out cables you need to try this one.  Of course do take it out of the jacks by grasping the rubber/plastic part.  Finally a good cable!",5,1,2018-11-2,1,0,0
"Bought this for my boyfriend. It only charges when plugged in a certain way and sometimes not at all.

Our home is filled with these cords as they are reliable and come at a great price. We have not had any issues with charging or tearing on any of the cords we have had for years.,5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
These things last! By far my favorite charging cable. They are a little pricey compared to others but These just don’t seem to get ruined. My moms had one for almost 2 years now and it still looks like new so I went ahead and bought it too.Having the extra length is so convenient too! Totally worth the extra bucks cause you’ll end up saving overtime since you don’t have to replace them as often as most iPhone chargers.,5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
I bought one of these cords a couple years ago and liked the durability and length so much that I’ve purchased them for almost everyone in my family as a gift. They hold up to teenage boys well too! We now have one in almost every room plus the cars.,5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0

Durability is key here. It does not break where the cord meets the charger tip. I’ve had several of these in differing lengths and they are marvelous.,5,1,2019-3-10,1,1,0

"Wish I could give it a zero! Had this cable for 2 mo. and it’s broken already. The lightning connection wobbles back and forth and it will no longer charge. It’s not like I was hard on it, it never left my bedside table where I plug my phone in every night. Thought by buying an Amazon Basic item it would have some standards for quality, but instead it’s like I opened my window and threw some money out on the street.",1,1,2018-7-27,1,0,0
I like that this charging cable is very long because I am able to keep my phone plugged while I am using it in bed. It also has a thick nylon material that products the wires which makes it very durable. It is an essential product as I am constantly breaking my other charging cables. This has lasted for a very long time and I have yet to experience any issues with it.,5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0

"I'm delighted to find a happy alternative to Apple's charger cables. My Apple cord had just died at 13 months old..... one month past the date that they will replace it.... the second one that I have needed to replace for my current iPhone 6.

"The price is what attracted me to this cable, and I am not disappointed. The rubber parts connecting the lightening and USB to the cable portion seem sturdier then the apple cables and the cable itself is heavily reinforced. The only issue I have is that it does not charge my phone as quickly as the apple cable, but for less then half the price, I can live with that.",4,1,2017-5-18,1,1,0
"Typical braided charging cord. Seems sturdy where the original ones like to break open near where the tip connects. It fits in the case opening so no issues there.

"At first, I thought this was an amazing purchase. I was actually happy with myself for coming across this cable, but after around 3 weeks of charging my phone, the cable died on me. (By the way, I’ve got an iPhone 8+ if any are wondering, so it’s not like it’s got “outdated” charging) And for me, that’s not acceptable, ESPECIALLY coming from Amazon Basics! So, all I’m saying is just go buy an apple cable, from Apple, not Amazon. Even go buy a cable from Walmart or something. Trust me, because I’ve got air pods and (-I got them with my phone, which was about 3 months ago) the charging cable has lasted me months longer.",3,1,2018-12-12,1,0,0
Had this cord previously through a friend. It’s lasted me nearly two years before it started to fizzle out. This is definitely the brand I’ll be sticking with. I’ve tried others and they always seem to work at first and then they die! This cord is super reliable.,5,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"I've bought this cable twice now, and both times the cable lost connection and started to tear right below the plastic part of the lightning end of the cable. The first cable lasted a while, but in the winter my phone needs to be plugged in constantly or it dies, and the cable would get twisted and knotted while in my pocket because of how stiff it is. This inevitably would twist at the threads on the lightning end which broke the rubber and eventually the wires in the cable. It didnt even last 3 months. It was cheap, sure, but i think i'll invest in a threaded reinforced cable for the future.",1,1,2019-4-26,1,0,0

I bought this as a replacement so that we could charge my sons’ communication devices. It’s not even out of the box a month and i had to pull the lightning end out of the charging port with a pair of pliers because it fell apart when I tried to unplug it.

I typically don't trust non apple products for charging my apple devices. I have seen issues where Non-Apple cables/connectors end up not working.

"The amazon basics line is SO beyond actual apple chargers quality it should be a crime. I will never use an actual apple charger again! I also am obsessed with the 6ft cord, makes charging my phone but still lounging around in the evenings so much easier ;)",5,1,2018-11-22,1,0,0

I have yet to find one of these types of cords that works 100% of the time great material holds up well but when charging sometimes it won’t let your phone work sometimes you have to unplug an plug back in to get it working and I only have been using for a month it’s brand new stays on the kitchen counter top for my wife an I to use. You get what you pay for I guess don’t waste your money on this cord,2,1,2019-1-24,1,0,0

Hopefully it’s still working 3 months from now - as I read some not so good reviews.",4,1,2019-2-7,1,0,0

My wife has a history of tearing up charging cords through neglect.  This cord is reenforced with its braided cord and connector ends.

These USB chargers originally worked as described although they are not fast chargers so it took a considerable amount of  time to charge my IPad. The problem started a few months afterwards. They stopped charging my devices. I would get an error message saying it was not supported. I don’t know if after iOS updates the chargers no longer work or if it’s something else but after 2 1/2 months I had to replace them. Even though they were in pristine condition.,2,1,2018-4-2,1,0,0

Have purchased 5+ of these over the last couple of years for my family.  We have been pleased and cant beat the price and convenience.  Generally they have held up well for at least a year which is all I ask of something at this price and with our heavy usage.  When they have stopped working <1 year the return/replacement from amazon was easy and efficient.  Recommend without reservation.,5,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
This cord is way better than the one that comes with your Apple product. It’s nice and long so you don’t have to sit right next to the outlet while charging.

"This product worked well for about 14 months. Now it functions intermittently and has become practically useless. I believe there were various warranties pointing to it lasting many years.

Not bad. 2/3 were broken within a couple months. It took me years of breaking aftermarket cables to realize you just spend the $20 on the Apple one and it lasts forever. The plastic degrades and falls off before they stop working.,3,1,2018-7-21,1,1,0

Just had a couple of cords go bad. The repeating issue I have is connection where cord goes into plug bending over time while using the device plugged in to charge.

I can honestly say this charger was at least slightly more durable than a glass egg. Other chargers I’ve bought from Amazon Basics have also superheated after a few months of use so now I can start fires whenever I go! Definitely bring this camping with you.

my cord only lasted 3 months until it broke. I will be contacting about the year warranty and hopefully getting a new one sent. This cord only stays at home and is never used for traveling so I'm not sure why the cord has broken so quickly.,2,1,2018-10-23,1,0,0
Great charger.  I have purchased so many chargers that work for about 2 weeks and then it says it's not compatible with my phone and then will no longer work.  AmazonBasics never have that problem.  Great product.  I intend to buy more!,5,1,2019-1-9,1,0,0
"I bought the 6 ft cord so my phone could reach my bed while charging. The cable has lasted me a long time now and still hasn't started to rip or anything. Nice length for reaching my bed.

"I've bought these cables brand new before and they work great. This time around, I thought I would save a couple of dollars by ordering a refurbished one.

I have only one issue with this cable - EVERYONE wants to charge their phones with it because its so fast!  Love it.  I was a bit skeptical because I saw so many complaints about it working for only a few weeks.  Well it's been a few months now and still going strong.  I especially like that the cable is so long and I can charge and use my phone at the same time.,5,1,2018-10-15,1,0,0
Bought this for my wife’s car. It’s held up better than any android cable and definitely better than the factory lightning cable that came with our phones and IPads. We can reach every outlet with ease and zero charging delays,5,1,2019-3-22,1,0,0

The cord is adequate however I don't believe it charges fast enough so I don't know if it's the cable itself or if it's just my phone my phone is brand new so I don't believe it's the phone itself I just don't know that it charges quickly it takes forever to charge,5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"I don’t know what the cause is but because this cable has metal ends, it gets very hot.

What seemed to be a good product sold by Amazon turns out to not last more than 3 months with proper care. All cables have slowly began to not charge my family iPhones. We noticed that the plug that connects into the iPhone is very weak and will easily bend/break if you leave the cord hanging and the weight of the cable relies on the plug. You can then feel the plug moving thus not charging the phone! Just really bad.. it has happened on all the cord lengths so now we don’t know if it’s just cheaply produced or the actual weight of the cord causing this issue.,2,1,2019-4-14,1,0,1
"What’s wrong with these? NOTHING! The only bad thing I can say is that I always lose them so I have to buy them again! These are sturdy, don’t seem to get fragile like the original cords that come with our phones!",5,1,2019-2-23,1,0,0

"This product was great for the first few uses, the length of the cord is great if your outlet is just out of a standard lightning cables reach. The reason it gets one star is because after a while this product seemed to have damaged my charging port, making all charging cables fall off if not completely still, it also doesn’t charge as fast as a lightning cable.",1,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
Don't buy this. It's garbage. We use this for our bed side and it stays there and it stopped working after a few weeks.,2,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
Update: Less than four months and there is already a short in the wire! Dropping my review down to two stars!Very sturdy. The one that came with my iPhone split at the plug. Best part... the rose gold matches my phone!!! 👍🏻,2,1,2018-10-10,1,0,0
This charger definitely does the trick. Charges the same as any ordinary Apple charger would. This one lasted me about 9 months before pooping out on me and doing that thing where it only charges if you hold it in a certain position. I think that lifespan is great considering the price and the fact that I constantly charge my phone while using it (which I’ve heard really kills a charger). Will be ordering this one again!,4,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0

This was the best charger that I have ever bought!! I plan on buying more in the future because my husband always wants to use mine - it charges quickly but my favorite part of this design is the rubber that is on the areas that typically bend for an apple charger.

This is my second time buying this cord (my first one was chewed by my rabbit). It has great durability except against rabbits. The rose gold color is cute & it’s a great length. Charges my phone quick and seems to last unlike a lot of other cords.,5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0

This cord is nice and we had no problems with it until about a year of use. This is the 4th one that the phone just quits recognizing as a charger. I’m guessing it has to do with the electrodes on the end. There are no other signs of wear.,3,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0

I was excited when I received this product. The price was great. The material felt very durable and it was extra long. After initial use I began to get frustrated.

I went through about 3 braided chargers including an Anker charger. This on has lasted over a year and still works like new. 1. Apple products have to have a certified cable (cause it’s apple and you have to pay more for everything). 2. Amazon Basics is the best one and by no means the most expensive.,5,1,2019-3-23,1,0,0
LOVE. I love the length of the cord and I love the heavy duty quality of the nylon. It's important for me because I definitely am guilty of propping the phone up (so that the cord bends a bit) while I'm watching a video or reading a book. This seems like it will stand up to some bending and twisting where my other cords have quickly split and exposed the inside wiring.,5,1,2017-2-24,1,0,0

I bought a 2-pack of these about 6 weeks ago.  1 of them has already gone bad.  It simply won't charge my iPhone and/or iPad.  Highly disappointed in this product.

I bought this cord Sept/2017. 22 months later it’s just started to malfunction. I am very happy with my purchase from before. It’s disheartening to see so many recent bad reviews. I was thinking of buying a new one. I’ll think about it some more and update my review once I do make a decision. I only wish the cord was longer 10ft or so. It’s just recently started to not charge anymore that i have to take out the lightning cable and turn it a round.,5,1,2019-6-9,1,0,0
Absolutely amazing! I’ve bought hundreds (exaggeration) of lightning cables from the official apple ones to cheap knockoffs and this is by far the best one.It looks sleek and and has a small velcro slip to keep it tidy and rolled when using it in small distances but extends when using for long distances.,5,1,2019-6-23,1,0,0

"I'd like to start off with mentioning I have ordered this product more than once. I feel as if these cables are hit or miss when it comes to functioning.

I’ve had this cord only a few months. It’s already broken as the cord connection is now intermittent. Sometimes it works and sometimes the charge starts and stops as if there is a short in the wiring or a poor connection.

"After losing several cables to hungry cats with something to prove, I thought maybe a nylon cable would be able to hold up to the task--and this one definitely has! The cord is very strong, doesn't tangle, is still flexible, and the 6' is a good length for when you still need to charge your phone but don't quite want to get out of bed just yet. Only complaint is that the braided nylon has enough stiffness that the cord can become twisted at times but this is easily solved by twisting it back. Absolutely no problems with the cable itself being loose or losing connectivity.",5,1,2017-5-24,1,0,0
"I bought this charger about a year ago for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved it then... and now!

Still fairly new so still evaluating longevity.  However the connectors at either end have some additional silicon on them to protect where the cord meets the connection which is a common failure point as these types of cords tend to get a lot of pressure there which then cause the cord to fail.

If I'm charging my phone, first I have to make sure it's charging in the first place, then I can't move it at all cause it'll stop charging.

I’ve had a few of these now. My first one broke within a month.  We would leave our phone plugged in to charge while we used it. This caused the cord to get bent near the end.  This one I have made sure to not bend near the top and bottom. So far so good.,4,1,2017-9-28,1,0,0

Very durable construction and works as expected with the latest iPhone's.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the nylon braid is a little stiff.

"Two reasons to give this a 5 star. #1, if you've bought charging cords in the past, you know that they will eventually fail.  Usually just seconds after the time period when Amazon will accept returns. After that period, you have to contact the manufacturer directly.  Good luck with that. For about $10, it's not worth the hassle of tracking them down and emailing receipts, etc. My Amazon cord failed a couple months in. No problem. Since they're the manufacturer (at least by name), they took it back in the same way that they take back other returns. Print the label, send, get credit.Reason #2, the little Velcro wrap. It ties around the cord to keep it from unraveling when not in use.  It's just the right size, easy to use, and makes my OCD life happy. I would even buy these little strips separately (are you listening Amazon?).",5,1,2017-3-13,1,5,0
