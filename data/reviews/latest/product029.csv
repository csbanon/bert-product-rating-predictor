We bought two pairs for each child to use at school during their classroom Ipad time. Each child had issues after the first week with connection and after a month sound problems with one side ultimately losing sound in one side. These look like nice quality headphones for kids but we were so sad they didn't hold up longer than a month and passed the return window. If you want headphones to last longer than a month don't buy these,1,1,2019-12-9,1,2,0
"Model BH2978, suppose to have mic. If it has one, the the package does not  mention it, and it doesn't work. Tried with three different devices. Waste of money and time. :(",1,1,2020-8-8,1,2,0
"These are so small they don’t fit my 9-year-old, which isn’t the issue.  The issue is that Amazon will only allow me to drop it off at one location in my area, and it’s actually not near me.  Every other item I’ve needed to return can be returned at my local UPS drop off. How could I have possibly known this wouldn’t be the case for these headphones?!Amended: I haven't changed my mind about the headphones, but the company is pretty awesome. They wrote and sent me a pair of headphones that are fitting and match the description. I am giving them 5 stars for the stellar customer service!",5,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
"My baby girl needed to have a pair of headphones that actually fit and we didn't have to worry about it harming her hearing in case she tried to turn it up too loud.  These fit her head perfectly, they didn't slide around or fall off, they're also very cute (love the colors) and I love the feature of toning down the decibels (dB) so as to not harm young delicate hearing, which was my concern with headphones.  Perfect; I definitely recommend for parents to get for their little ones.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"EDIT: MPOW reached out and is sending me replacements for the headphones that broke. It's great that they're standing behind their products like that. I've bought other MPOW products that have been great, so at this point, I'm just going to assume it was a bad batch. Great customer service.---",4,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"After 7 months one of the headphones has stopped working,  my square trade plan won't replace it because it's under manufacturing warranty but trying to contact the company for the warranty is a joke! No one responds. Theres no phone number and the one email I got seriously asked me if I tried them in a different device! Now I have a nagging 9 year old that cant use her headphones!",2,1,2019-7-13,1,3,0
Overall nice headphones for kids. The main reason I chose these was because another set could be plugged in for sharing sound to a sibling or friend. I'm unhappy that the cord is not the nice braided fabric that doesn't tangle. This cord is the rubber that seems to stick to everything and can snag hair. I may have to return the 3 I bought for my kids for that reason.,4,1,2019-7-17,1,2,0
"Bought 2 of these for my daughters. They are doing the virtual learning at home, and these work great. You get what you pay for with the price, but the plus side is that these work great for their intended function. My kids can hear their teacher perfectly, and when they speak, the teacher can hear them as well. Not sure as to the noise cancelling properties, as it is already quiet for them, but one would assume that they work at least somewhat. Overall a great buy.",5,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
"I purchased these headphones for my child's learning program they use at school on tablets. For the price point, I was extremely pleased with the fit and quality of the product, as well as the performance. I especially liked the ability to set the volume to a lower limit. While not childproof, it helped me to teach my child that listening to sounds too loud can hurt their hearing if they aren't careful, and acts as a safety for them as they use it. He's been able to use it on all media so far without turning the limit off, so it's a well placed limit in my estimation.",5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"My daughter uses it in school for class and she says it is very comfortable and easy to use, her classmates admire it, and she wants another pair for at home use. :)",5,1,2018-9-20,1,7,0
"These headphones, so far, are very well made. They are extremely bendable, almost to the point of being a little floppy. This is good though for kids who may be a little rough on their headphones. The color is pretty, and looks exactly as pictured. They don't look or feel cheap or flimsy. My 9 year old has these for school to use with her chromebook. She says they're comfortable to where, and unlike others, she's not spending time pushing them up and adjusting them, as she has had to do with the others she had in the past. They're not too big or too small, and adjust easily. As for the sound, no complaint. They sound very clear. The volume control is a little confusing. Either the volume is low, and is controlled, or it's loud, and not volume controlled. I was expecting a normal volume+/- button, and automatic volume control for kids. This is not a bad thing, since she's older and won't voluntarily blast her eardrums out, but if you're looking for something to send to school with a child, that is controlled and doesn't get too loud, this is not it.As for shipping, the headphones were nearly folded and incased in bubble wrap, then secured in a product box. The box showed a diagram, and there was an instruction pamphlet inside. The box itself was inside another large Amazon box, and well protected with more bubble wrap. It arrived on time and in good shape. No complaints on shipping.",4,1,2019-8-8,1,1,0
"Awesome! The cords do not tangle! I keep seeing my twins putting the cords in their mouths, and I feel better knowing it's food grade. they are almost 8 and they are still do not handle electronics as nice as they should. So far, a little over a week, they are holding up perfectly!. I have witness them being sat on by an adult, dropped, and carelessly knocked to the hardwood floor. No dings, scratches, and worries so far!",5,1,2019-1-2,1,3,0
"First, let me say we've tried a TON of different kids headphones, most of which don't last more than 6-8 months. I was really excited about these because they seemed more sturdy, plus they are much more comfortable than most since they go over the ear. Sound is great, comfort is great, they fold together nicely and easily. These were the perfect pair of kid headphones, until they stopped working.We took such good care of these, always putting them up right after use, in hopes that they would last longer.  They died after less than a month of gentle use. The sound will come in every once in awhile, but just cuts out again. Maybe they were defective from the start with a loose wire or something.",3,1,2019-8-4,1,1,0
"Who wants to be driven crazy having to listen to their kids' crappy shows/music/games/whatever on their tablets and whatnot?  At the same time, kids are dumb and turn up the sound in headphones to levels that are dangerous for their hearing.  Enter limited decibel headphones.  We've had several types over the years and our family really likes these ones.  They're pretty comfortable and take a decent amount of beating.  If problems do come up, the seller is easy to work with and helped replace things quickly.  The best part is the extra port to allow headphones to chain with each other.  I'm not sure the sound quality is great when you do that, but that isn't the point-it's to let all the kids listen to the show or game on the same device without fighting and it works great for that.  My kids love to cuddle up together, headphones connected, and watch the same show on a tablet or the Wii U.",5,1,2019-6-7,1,3,0
"I bought two of these for my kids. They Worked well for about a month then both started glitching constantly and after 2 months they both quit working. I contacted Amazon since the return period had expired and they refunded me (not fully for some reason but I think that has to do with my payment method, not sure). I replaced these with a different brand and went Bluetooth. Cost a bit more but still inexpensive. The corded headphones are just awful quality and break quickly.",1,1,2019-10-26,1,1,0
My daughter loves it and color is just what we were looking for.. used it in the plane and she was on her own cloud nine..quality of sound is great not to mention price is really inexpensive for the sound quality u will experience.,5,1,2018-11-18,1,3,0
"My daughter loves these. The soft padding for the ears and in the band for the head make it comfortable and I love that there is a switch to change the volume max on the cord, just be sure to talk to your kids about the safety of protecting their ears. Getting ready to purchase another in a different color!",5,1,2020-3-23,1,3,1
"We bought two different kinds of headphones for our kids to use on our long road-trip coming up.I was nervous the sound on these would be too quiet for driving. I personally tried them out (they fit my adult head as well as my 6 year olds head) when we were going 70 mph with music going on in the car and the family talking, and I was still able to clearly hear the audiobook I was listening too.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,1,0
"I was really disappointed that these absolutely DO NOT LIMIT the volume to any safe level, but especially not to 85dB. I didn't even turn these up to full volume while wearing them because it was too loud for my ears. I compared them to our 2 other sets of headphones that have been great at limiting noise; those kept the volume at a comfortable level. Another thing that wasn't a good design is that they made the volume-limiting switch too easy for the child to access and use. So, we are going back getting the ONANOFF BuddyPhones Inflight, Volume-Limiting Kids Headphones which have worked great for us, although a bit pricier.",1,1,2020-4-16,1,6,0
Bought these for 3 yr old and 6 yr old grandkids. They love using the headphones to watch and listen to videos on their iPad and listen to my iPod music. Perfect to be able to connect together on one device. I can use my personal headphone to connect to one of theirs which is connected to the headphone that is connected to a device so all 3 of us could listen. My different headphone only has a cord so nobody can connect to me so we do it their way. ( Perfect headphones have good volume for kids and grandma. They used them easily on their first plane trip. They also fit adults too. They feel soft on our ears.,5,1,2018-11-26,1,3,0
"The headphones are great! My kids actually want to wear them. They are comfortable and durable. I like how you can plug one headphone into the other and both kids can listen to same tablet. The head phones have a volume control so no matter how ""loud"" they turn it up the headphones keep it low enough so there is no damage to the ears (no more annoying repeat movies/songs!)",5,1,2018-10-5,1,3,0
"Very good headphones for my daughters! These are very comfortable to wear, adjustable (my 4 year old can wear it comfortably and so can I), it's very soft to the touch and the part that goes on your ears is very squishy. The wire is braided and seems to be high quality. We haven't used the microphone portion yet, but intend to when distance learning starts. I love that you can plug one headphone into another and share the hearing! This means my 2 daughters can listen at the same time, while sharing 1 screen. Great product, worth the money, would buy again, highly recommend.",5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"I purchased this for my 6 year old son to communicate virtually for distance learning. He has been using it for video calls with his grandparents and friends. He has also learned to use it on his Amazon device to listen to his shows during night time (yes, I now enabled screen time settings, but I thought that was a latter in life thing).The mic is perfect for him and the grandparents are able to hear him clearly. My kid has a very small head and this fits him well. He said it is very comfortable. When I touch the padding, I feel it is quite soft. I will most likely be purchasing this again next year (if it doesn't last).",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones for my 4th grade son with disabilities last year for school opting for another brand for my daughter in kindergarten and hers broke after only a few months while this brand lasted all year of school, through long car trips this last summer and are back to work at school this year as well. When it came time to order a new one for my daughter we made the obvious choice and went with these headphones. Lots of fun color choices, my kids love how comfortable they are and easy to use and they are DURABLE! The shipping was fast and they are definitely worth the price. I put their names on the inside of the headband and it’s also lasted so they don’t get mixed up with classmates.",5,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
The cable came out after the 1st 30 minutes of use,1,1,2019-9-14,1,5,1
"These are super comfortable, and fit my 5 year old perfectly! She absolutely loves them. I bought them back in April, but my sister just asked me if I ""knew of any kids headphones that I would recommend,"" and I recommended these to her. I figured if I was going to (quite literally) recommend them to her, I should probably also recommend them to other amazon shoppers! These have a great rating already, and with good reason. The cord is durable, and the headset itself is super soft and comfy, which is important for pretty much anything being worn by a kid (especially a sensitive one like mine). So yes, I recommend these. :-)",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"Firstly, just let me say that these are great headphones for kids. Good sound quality, built in microphone, and safe with the volume limiter.My daughter uses these for her online  school lessons. BUT!!",3,1,2020-6-7,1,2,1
Buy these every school year for my son.  They hold up for about a year of 7 year old use. Fast shipping.,5,1,2019-8-26,1,4,0
"EDIT: MPOW graciously sent us a replacement and so far it works great.  We actually have 3 of these now (purchased 2 originally and received a replacement for the defective pair).  We will see how the other 2 hold up to kids, but we are pleased with the customer support!Original 2 star review: We purchased these for our 4 year old. They worked well at first, except the top of the head strap has started cracking! It's been getting worse over time as he takes them on and off. We aren't rough with them. I think soon they won't be usable.",4,1,2020-5-10,1,1,0
"Love these! We now have three of them. They sit nicely on all of my children’s ears ages: 3, 5, 8 & 10.  They had never had headphones before and recently went on an airplane and we needed them for the trip. Good quality, fits well, room to grow, goes over the ear not on the ear, good sound level limits. I didn’t listen to anything on the airplane to know if it has good noise reduction. But everything else was great. They fold up nicely as well. I even returned another type to get more of these before our trip. I wish they had come with a small drawstring bag to keep them safe but that’s my only complaint.",5,1,2020-9-25,1,1,0
Update: since my last review the company had immediately sent out a new pair of headphones. Thank God!! I didn't even know they had until it showed up at my door. I had bought another headphone but My son wears these all day. So the other brand is just sitting there. These headphones are durable and sounds good and not too loud with us s concern. You can study the decibal woohoo is kid friendly and perfect!! A must buy.It was wonderful! Being home and everyone on their own device,5,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
"Love these headphones! I got these for my girls because every $15 pair of headphones I've bought for them were destroyed in no time, so I decided to try something with a little more quality. As soon as I held these in my hands and tried them on, I could tell I made the right choice, they look good and feel great! My first concern with these was the volume. With headphones being so quite these days, even on full blast, I was concerned that these decibel limited headphones would be TOO quite for my kids to hear them but, to my surprise, they were plenty loud enough without being too loud. My second and only other concern was the size. I've gone through several ""kids"" sized over the ear headphones that, even at the smallest setting, were too big to fit their heads, making them completely useless. Not these ones, they fit perfect on the kiddos and even fit great on me. I'm so pleased with this purchase, they have absolutely everything I was looking for in a pair of headphones and I would happily but them again.",5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
Good headphone With good sound. My son wore them for a week and easily snapped the ear piece. Patozon customer service team Was gracious enough to send another pair that my son is enjoying and taking great care of.I have to be honest but I was not expecting this type of service so kudos to Patozon for replacing the broken headphones.,4,1,2018-12-18,1,5,0
These are not actually volume limited. I just tested on my child’s iPad and when I increased the volume they went way too loud for safe listening with either volume selection in place (85db and 95db). I already threw away the packaging but will likely be looking for something else that is actually safe for children’s hearing. I do not recommend.,1,1,2020-7-12,1,3,0
"We needed new headphones because our kid was always complaining he could hear our music or conversation when he had his old headphones on. We bought these and tried them on first- he said they were very comfortable and he liked the top part that had some cushion. We then used them for a 3 hour car ride. No complaints from him about our music from the radio, and he got to enjoy plenty of shows using his iPad. They stay on his head well (he's about to be 6, for size reference) and we can't hear his show or audio from outside the headphones. Thumbs up all around.",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"Overall the headphones were comfortable and sounded great.  The problem was that the button was faulty. it would  kick you out of class, skip ahead in tracks or podcasts, very frustrating, thought we were getting a good product based on the reviews.  However went to return them and I am just 3 days outside of the return window and now I'm stuck with a faulty product.  So unfortunate, cant say I would recommend these because I dont know what they are like when they are working correctly.",1,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0
"The first time I ordered these, I thought I had made a good purchase. They were very comfortable. My son, who is autistic, loved the blue and didn't mind them on his ears, (which is a big deal). After a couple of months he told me they didn't work anymore. Sure enough, I tried them and the sound had quit in one of the ear pieces...then altogether. I thought maybe I had just bought a lemon or that my son hadn't taken good care of them when I wasn't looking and re-ordered the same pair again in June of this year. They are already NOT WORKING!!! Same issue again!!!! I KNOW they have been taken care of and haven't been used much at all. I am so disappointed!",3,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"I bought 3 pairs of these headphones in different colors for my two sons (10, 8) and my daughter (6) to go with their laptops while doing school at home during the COVID-19 sheltering at home since they were all sharing a space.  They all love them and say they are very good.  My eldest does complain that they can make your ears hurt if you wear them for a very long time, but I think that may be because he is approaching teenager size and they may be too small to fully cover his ears comfortably.  (My daughter also complained, but she wears glasses, and we figured out she just needed to adjust the band width to get it to fit properly over her ears and glasses comfortably.)  I have used them a few times to help them on Zoom meetings and Hangouts calls and I was impressed with the sound quality and how comfortable they were.  Also, the noise cancellation is almost too good.  They can't hear anything outside of what they are listening to, so you have to usually tap them on the shoulder to get their attention, as even yelling may not guarantee getting their attention.  I also really like how they have a volume control so they can't continually increase the volume, so their hearing is protected.  All in all, a great quality for bargain price.  I would definitely get them again.",5,1,2020-5-6,1,4,0
"Going on a six-hour road trip with my daughter and I tested the headphones as soon as I received the package and they are wonderful.  So far so good.  I hope it lasts.  I bought the apple adapter, since we have iPhones and it all works very well.  The headphones are soft and comfortable; and the colors are SPOT ON.  Thanks",5,1,2019-10-22,1,1,1
"Update:I gave this product a 3-star review at first (around early June), because it came with the volume limiting feature not working properly. I didn't expect to receive a refund or replacement as it's been months since the purchase.

"These little cuties are great! After spending 1/2 a day in my office with my 4yo when he had no school, I ordered these IMMEDIATELY. They have been excellent and I can’t wait to give them a try on our next road trip. He uses them with his tablet to play games and watch videos. I like the volume restriction on them since he is one of those kids who has to have everything loud. I know his hearing is protected  with these! Only regret may be not doing Bluetooth/wireless ones... with the Apple products now having lightening, it is a little cumbersome. But they are really to be used with his Kindle Fire, so it hasn’t presented too much of an issue. And they are just super cute to boot!",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"Got these for my 6 year old daughter and she loves them. She flipped out with the color and kept marveling over it, she tried them over youtube videos and gave her approval with sound and comfort.",5,1,2020-2-23,1,2,1
"Great headphones for kids. They have adjustable volume control where its either below 85dB or if in a noisey area you can switch it to have a max of 95dB. The ones I purchased were the dark blue/green ones and  they are WIRED ones. They are very soft cushy material at the ears and the curve that goes on the top of the head which my 7 yr old says he loves. The ear muff parts also fold up into themselves towards the curved part that goes above the head so they are more compact and can transport eaiser. These ones also have a neat feature where you can attach another headphone set to them so you can share the same video/music/movie that one child is watching. I have bought the lighter blue pair in the past about a yr ago and those ones were just as good but could be both wired or Bluetooth so I assumed these were going to be the same but they are only WIRED, not a deal breaker for me as my child uses them with the cord anyways we just liked the option in case the cord was lost or the device didn't have a headphone jack. I would recommend these to anyone with kids due to the volume level adjustment limits as those are important and just because they are soft and work great! I have personally not listened to them myself so I have no first hand experience however my 7 yr old is loving them and uses them all the time which is why after a year with the old set he needed a new pair, they broke at the part where they extend and can fold up inside themselves more than likely from the roughness of a then 6yr old opening them and folding them countless times within a year, the sound quality and all that never failed and they still work just are taped in one spot lol! If your on the fence about them I say go for it they are great and I have bought other types of blutooth headphones from the mpow company and have always have great experiences with all of my purchases!",5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"I bought this for my daughter, and can't attest to the quality of the sound, though it seemed fine to her. Unfortunately after a couple of months of use the headphones broke on one side. I don't think that my daughter has done anything to them, it was just normal use, and she's been using other headphones without them breaking. So I imagine that these are flimsier than the others.Edit: After posting this, I got contacted by HBH US, who said that this is covered under warranty and they will send a new one. We'll see how this goes but for now I'm increasing the rating from 3 to 4 stars.",4,1,2020-3-9,1,1,0

I was actually surprised that these fit my two-year-old's little head perfectly! I thought they were going to be a little big on him but I actually had to adjust the size to make them a little bigger to fit his head. They are very soft and he seems very comfortable wearing them. I bought these to go with his new Amazon kids tablet. They work great. I would definitely recommend.,5,1,2019-12-17,1,2,1
"We were so excited to receive these headphones as the reviews convinced me they were perfect for my child, and according to my child, ""they are awesome!"". They fit well on little heads and the ears, and are very steady. The hearing protection with the volume control between the two decibels (dB) is such a good way to keep high volume away from children's ears. I purchased the headphones for the school's virtual learning program, and so far so good. Overall, I highly recommend them!",5,1,2020-9-2,1,1,0
update: nothing wrong with product. It was a laptop issue that did not recognize that I plugged in a headset. After some laptop program update everything now works. Kids love the headphones. They are super comfortable and don’t hurt their ears for long period usage. Would definitely buy.Have an issue big issue. Purchased this because kids need to use zoom for school and these headphones have a mic but I cannot get the mic to work on our dell laptops. For some reason when we plug the headphone jack in the mic off the headphone wire does not work/ get recognized and laptop still uses laptop mic. Please help. Other than that kids love the headphones. Feel great and sound great with volume dampener control.,4,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"I can't say enough good things about these headphones! I purchased for my 4 year old son to save myself from the awful sounds his tablet was making while he played games. And if I had listen to one more song from Disney's Zombies...I was going to lose my mind! He absolutely loves them! The noise canceling MUST work well because he's always shouting ""WHAT!?"" when we try and talk to him while he's wearing them. These have been a savior for me...they've given me some much needed peace and quiet. My son loves them too! We're on our second pair now.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"I ordered these headphones in the blue, teal, and pink. The blue and teal are wonderful- came just as described. But the pink pair is slightly different. The cord is braided instead of being rubber and it doesn't come out of the headphone jack like the other two do. They are minor differences, but I really want to be able to unplug the cord from the headphones. The model number on the box is slightly different than what's listed in the description too. This is the second pair they've sent me, as I requested a return on the original pair that was wrong, and they just sent the same exact (wrong) pair. I will be returning the pink pair and ordering something else, which is disappointing because the other two do seem like decent headphones.Some pros of the headphones are that they fit all 3 of my kids, ranging from 20 months to 5 years and the volume control and sound is great.",2,1,2019-9-13,1,7,1
So cute! Awesome how they hook together so you only need to plug one in. But really terrible volume! Not for loud cars or activities. So hard to hear and not noise cancelling at all. I would return them and try something else if we hadn’t already tried them multiple times. Which is a bummer because they’re so cute and convenient.,2,1,2018-5-26,1,1,1
Great all across the board,5,1,2019-12-29,1,2,0
The headphones work just fine and seem to be comfortable. The only frustration I have is that the cord isn't attached to the headphones so it can get disconnected easily. These are for my five year old and I'm sure this will happen a lot and he's going to get frustrated with it. Understandably so...I have a pair that disconnect easily too and it drives me insane as well. I know it's readily pictured and described invest detail so that's my own fault for not thinking about it when I ordered but that's the only thing that is a negative.,4,1,2019-8-10,1,4,0
Bought these for me more than my grandson so I didn’t have to hear what he was playing !  Ha.  Actually they are made durable for a decent price and have a good warranty.  He loves them and so do I!!,5,1,2020-1-28,1,2,1
"I ordered two pairs of these headphones for my kids, very excited at all the features including a wire and noise control for young kids.From the start, we made sure the headphones were kept in good condition and put away when not in use. Around 6 months after buying them, the first blue pair cracked. It cracked where the headphones are supposed to extend, there is a thin piece of plastic that cracked very easily as my son was trying to make the headphones bigger. Thinking this was a fluke, I ordered a replacement pair.",1,1,2020-6-29,1,1,1
"*****UPDATE******EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!

"Let me just say, I have bought so many pairs of headphones for my two children! They are a little rough with them, and they end up broken within a month. I actually stopped buying them headphones because of this, but I decided to get them each a new pair for an upcoming trip. I liked this because it came with two sets of headphones, one was pink and one was blue, perfect for my boy and girl. They're pretty great, I love the sharing ability. The compatibility is not just for this brand of headphones either. When the headphones are just plugged in,  the sound is pretty quiet (which I like to protect my kids' ears) I have used their headphones as well, and the volume actually does go up pretty loud. What I like the best about these headphones is that after a few months they are still in great shape! I will definitely buy again.",5,1,2019-9-11,1,7,0
Just got today. Feel very sturdy & work well. My daughter will love the color!,5,1,2019-11-21,1,5,1
"Bought these for my niece and they work great!! Love the sharing feature and she raves about how comfortable they are. It’s also nice that you can set the volume as well, so no worries about her listening to music too loud. The colors are her favorite colors as an added bonus.",5,1,2019-4-18,1,7,1
We got these and an amazing fire tablet for our girls for long car rides but they ended being very useful during quarantine! I have a 2 and 4 year old and the fit both of their heads well and they used them properly. Super awesome price as well. I will be highly recommending these.,5,1,2020-5-18,1,5,1
Very nice head phones for children. Very comfortable and nice sound quality. My 1yo used these but the 3&5yo liked them also.,5,1,2019-7-10,1,5,0
"UPDATE: While these were amazing at 1st use, I was just informed by my daughters teacher that the sound is only coming out of one headphone.Brought these for my daughter for school when they work on the Chromebooks. Asked her how they worked out for her on her 1st day of use and she said ""good"". Glad she likes because we have been through a few headphones that she complained about but these not one complaint which is a huge plus for me!!!!",2,1,2019-10-30,1,2,0
"I'd purchased a number of different headphones prior to these and they all lasted about 6 months before my son broke the audio cable, snapped the jack, sat on them or something of the like that killed the headphones. Also it was difficult finding some that were small and comfortable enough for a 7-10yo kids head but where the ear piece was large enough to cover their ear comfortably.These hit the spot in every way. They are not quite ""over the ear"" but they are pretty close and are soft enough that the kids can comfortably use them for longer periods (school, long car rides on their iPads etc..). The padded headband is great, again for the longer periods of use it's not applying pressure on the tops of their heads. The adjustable sides are easy to use & robust for kids. Sound quality I'm assuming is fine as the kids have not complained (haven't personally tested that myself).  Lastly they are robust - my son had a habit of walking away with them in the ipad and ripping the jack out, but these have lasted very well. The jacks are angled and reinforced, and the cable has put up with the abuse my son dishes out also (we've had the wire inside the cable break on multiple occasions on previous headphones I'd tried, but never on these).  They also fold up which is convenient for packing in a school or travel bag.",5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"I bought two of these headphones in different colors for my 5yo son and I to use for online learning with my Mac Book. I love that they can plug into each other so that multiple people can listen through the same audio jack. There is a pause/play button on the mic, and when you press it while using a Mac Book, iTunes opens. I noticed that the volume is lower on the headphones that are not plugged directly into the audio jack on the computer. Also, the microphone only works on the headphone plugged directly into the audio jack. Now, after using them for 11 weeks, this light blue one is not functioning properly. First, I noticed that one speaker stopped working when plugged directly into the audio jack, and now there is no sound coming through the headphones when plugged into the other set of headphones. I really like the product but I am dismayed that it is malfunctioning so soon after purchase.",3,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"Update (12/19): I intended to update our review earlier this week with a positive turnaround, but we can't.. After our original review, the manufacturer sent us a replacement for FREE! Excellent customer service. It was actually a slightly different model because the cord was permanently connected, rather than removable as our first set, which we preferred because it wouldn't get loose and disrupt the sound. Unfortunately, the new set broke IN THE SAME SPOT, right at the expansion connection. I had been so hopeful. My son loved these, soft and comfortable, blocked noise (from us too!), but now both sets are useless. We attempted to duct tape with supports but it doesn't sit right. These headphones are just not for us.Original Review (9/19): We ordered this for our son. The volume control feature worked as advertised. The sound quality was great. We thought it was a great fit. However, the quality of the materials is poor -- the second time we adjusted the fit to his head, it snapped right at the expansion connection and is no longer useable because that side just dangles. We thought we found a great set but we're disappointed that it broke so soon.",2,1,2019-9-20,1,3,1
Don’t buy this if you want some headphones that work to protect your kids ears. I had to return them. There are much better ones in Amazon that actually work.,1,1,2019-11-21,1,5,0
"Product was a gift for a child. Looked cute. I tested them with my iPhone when she didn't want to wear the headphones, 5 minutes after getting them out of the box.  One side only worked about 20% of the time, cutting in and out, like a short.  Super annoying, especially as a gift. Very disappointed with the quality.  Cannot recommend. Return window closed, cool.",1,1,2019-11-29,1,3,0
"I like that I can connect my apple ear phones so that I can listen in on my kindergartener’s virtual, school calls. Sound Quality is cool. Not sure if these claim to be noise canceling but I could hear my son talking from upstairs... but I do like how these “cup” the ears comfortably. So far no real complaints. They costed a bit more than I like to spend for kids’ headphones but other than that...no complaints. I’ll try to come back after she uses them a few more times.",4,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0

"We have bought several headsets the past couple years that don’t last very long. These appear better made and more sturdy, but time will tell. They fit our 6 yr old granddaughter well and they are comfortable, yet snug.  She said they block out the noise well.",5,1,2020-6-25,1,3,1
A while back I ordered a different Mpow product (blutooth headset and mic combo) and was really happy with the quality and value. So when I saw these on my search for children earphones I gave them a try. They fit my 4yr old (pictured) and my 2 year old wonderfully. They sat down with their tablets and my husband and I enjoyed a solid hour of silence. No fidgeting. No adjusting. No fighting. I’m very happy with this purchase and confident they will help with the remote learning programs as school starts up again!,5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,1
"Exactly what I needed!  The ear pieces are not round, but more of an oval shape, so they completely cover my daughter's ears.  She was complaining that the first headphones we purchased didn't cover her ears and she could still hear too much around her during her time on the laptop.  She LOVED these immediately!  Cushy comfortable; cupped her ears, didn't  just sit on top of her ears; and she loves the pink color, her favorite.  She's happy, I'm happy!",5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"My kids love these headphones. We used them for two recent flights and my son kept them on the whole time, with no complaints. Since they are volume limiting, I was worried that they might not be loud enough for a noisy flight, but they were. I also like the fact that when my kids are wearing them, other people can't hear what is coming out of the headphones. (I'm sure the passengers sitting next to my kids appreciated that too). We've only had them for a month and have taken them on two trips (4 flights), but I think they are going to last for awhile. They are very flexible, yet sturdy.",5,1,2018-5-11,1,3,0
I gave it a 4 because we didn’t purchase it for quality sound so it wouldn’t be fair to rate the sound as it’s review. They were purchased as a gift for my niece who is very tiny despite her age. No earbuds or earphones fit her after buying dozens of different types/brands I came across this pair that fit toddlers and they are perfect. She loves them. With most schools being on-line I would recommend these for small grade schoolers. They are very comfortable for her.,4,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"Original review: I bought these headphones for my 6 year old son in Mid-March.  At first, we were very happy with the noise cancellation, sound quality and comfort features of the headphones.  We used them quite often for online school activities until recently.  However, they puttered out completely by the end of May without much warning.  I need quality headphones that last more than 2.5 months.Update:  The company contacted me after the review above and sent us a new pair of headphones.  I was shocked that they would replace a product after so long.  So far, so good!",5,1,2020-6-6,1,1,0
I bought the headphones for remote learning for my kids. It is soft and adjustable. It does cancel out some noise and allows the kids to concentrate more on their teachers rather than getting distracted with their surroundings. It doesn’t cancel out all noise which is good because the kids can still hear me when I need to get their attention.  There are only 2 volume options to limit the decibels. You will still have to adjust the volume using the iPad. I also like that you can create a series and attach more headphones to each other to share sound contents.,5,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
My two little guys needed headphones for road trips and now remote learning. They love these so far. I love that volume control means they won’t get their ears blasted with sound and they love the fit and colors. So far they like wearing them around the house. My older one wears them some for games and my only challenge is getting his attention now. The microphone works well for remote learning for now. So far we are happy with them!,5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"The main thing I want to mention is that when you connect these headphones they work best with the straight phone jack. When you use the L shaped phone jack to share the headphones the l-shape does not connect well. I'm using these for my kids distance learning and the headphones with the l-shape phone jack are constantly falling off. Also I wish the sound protection was a little bit better like the cartoon character ones you get from Walmart or Target, you like the paw patrol or the Spider-Man headphones, these I feel are still a little loud for their ears.",4,1,2020-8-26,1,0,1
"I bought these for my 4 year old to wear while he's playing his educational computer games, and they fit his little head perfectly.  He finds them comfy and I like the volume reduction control they come with.  The microphone works also, we used it for his class Zoom meeting and I also was able to plug my headphones into his to share the meeting sound.  They have a tough-looking cord, hopefully it will hold up to the abuse of my kids.",5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"My son has very sparingly used these headphones and as of today, only one side works! He was so upset he wanted to throw them in the trash. Do not buy if you’d like your headphones to last.

Wonderful headphones. I already shared the link with my best friend to buy for her son for virtual learning. We ordered these for our 8 year old and she loves them. They were supposed to be for virtual learning but she uses them for everything. They are so comfortable I found her just sitting there reading with them on with nothing playing through them because the noise cancelation is that good. Which is awesome for is with a screaming toddler on the loose. The design and structure of the headphones is very durable. It has a nice rope cord and an extra aux output for dual listening with is great for us of her and our middle daughter want to listen to 1 device together with their headphones on. The only issue I ran into was when placing my order I could only purchase 1 per customer.,5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
We bought these for our 3 yr old boy.  He is a tiny battlebot and rough as can be on everything.  These have held up VERY well and the volume restraint works PERFECTLY.  He's tossed these and he takes them on/off himself and loves them.  It helps when we're riding in a vehicle to keep him occupied without all of us having to listen to Blippi!  Highly recommend and would repurchase!,5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
These headphones are great. My girls can connect their headphones and listen to the same thing. Works great especially now that “school from home” is happening and I have a toddler that wants in on schoolwork. She can listen in to the books on YouTube or math homework or school games or whatever on the computer and think she’s doing it too! I just bought another set to have in reserve.,5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
I ordered these for my 7 1/2 yr old Grand Son who is doing home school.  He loves them.  He said they fit great and are very comfortable.  He was also amazed at how well they block outside noises.  I was sitting right next to him and he was listening to a lesson and he said he could barely hear me while I was on the phone.  Would definitely recommend!!!!,5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0

"Got these for my average-sized 3 year old son. They fit him AND me, although I’m a little small. The sound quality is great, they’re super comfortable, and they worked totally fine on our long-haul flight (even with decibels controlled to 85). I checked the sound level several times on the flight and he was happy throughout. Honestly, they feel a lot like the Bose QCs I use professionally. I’m thinking about buying a pair for myself.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
I bought these for my son to use at school. They arrived well packaged and were awesome quality when I took them out of the box. There is a padded area on the top that touches your head. The earphones are soft and comfy and cover the ears nicely. I got the red and black and the color is nice and true to the photo. The sound quality is really nice and other noises are blocked out. Great headphones for the price. Will be buying more.,5,1,2019-9-7,1,0,0
Ordered two of these for kids to do their online school classes.  Kids have been using them for almost a month now and they work great.  I don't worry about damage to their ears with the sound control.  Classmates and teachers are able to hear them through the built-in microphone.

Changing my rating to 4 stars!My 11 year old son received these for Christmas, one month later they are broken.

Yes, but not too loud for my child's ears. I wouldn't worry if he listened to something for a while on loud. The quietest device was his kindle tab.. Which he would be on the most with these. I will be buying a 2nd set for my 3 year old.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0

The sound was too quiet for my child but when we tried to raise the volume on the PC the noise in the headphones was very crackly.",2,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0

These were purchased as an accessory to my daughters Kindle fire.  We’ve had them for about three months and they were working great until tonight when she took them off and the plastic broke on the right side.

Great customer service and it appears I just got a weak pair of headphones the first time. Satisfied now!We have only had these for a very short period of time and already they are broken! At first I loved them and recommended them to many because I love how you can connect two into each other, but for being kid headphones, I would expect them to be built a little sturdier than this... hopefully the other set doesn’t break too and this one was just a dud :(",4,1,2020-7-6,1,0,1
Bought these for my kindergartner as headphones were on his school supplies list due to the times we are in. He started using them at home as I have a newborn & he doesn't like to hear him cry. I sent the headphones to school & next day I get a text from his teacher that he is demanding to have his headphones back to take home lol!! So I'm purchasing a second pair! So coming from a 5yr old the nose cancelation & sound quality/volume are great!! Plus he hasn't destroyed the cord & volume control on the cord like he has done with previous other brand headphones. Thanks!,5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
These headsets are top quality and love the fact that they fold! My son is able to hear real well in the noisy car with them and the volume switch which increases the sound slightly (and enough to make a difference) when in noisier conditions is perfect!

**Update - was contacted by seller within days after review posted.  Exchanged emails to describe problem and received a brand new headphone a couple days later.

This is our second pair of these headphones. A friend bought us our first pair to replace a broken set of a cheaper brand. These are such better quality. My 2 (now 3) year old wears them for noise cancelling headphones all the time. I assume they must be comfortable. My 6 year old wears them when listening to music and watching dvd's in the vehicle.

EDIT: below you'll see my original review with one star. I had thought it was too late to return these since my daughter didn't tell me for a couple months. This company's saw my review and without me asking or anything just sent me a brand new pair that works fine. I will say the customer service is phenomenal and I have changed my review to five stars for that alone. Due to their prompt response and initiative I would guess that their product is always of good quality and I just got a one-off oddball.These broke in 2 days. Just stopped working. Unfortunately my daughter didn't tell me for 6 weeks (she thought it would make me sad?)...,5,1,2020-3-15,1,0,0
"I have bought these several times--not because they break, but because they ""disappear"".  Daughter loves the ability to share listening with a friend.  Noise cancelling is so good my daughter usually doesn't hear me talking to her unless she see's my lips moving.  Adults in our house use these too but are a tad smallish for an adult--we don't care",5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
"These are great headphones, and they fit my 4/5 year old comfortably and well. However, as most children (boys especially) are not the gentlest handlers of objects, he has gone through 3 pairs. At least they're cheap but I guess that's why they fell apart so easily. He slams them down on the desk or couch and the top comes apart to the point of exposing the wires and eventually not working anymore. If you are looking for a better investment move on from these. Otherwise they're good for a few months at a time.",3,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0

The loudest volume when the limit switch was on was the same as when it was off - too loud for a little one's ears.

"I bought the Cerulean and light blue combination for one of my kids and he LOVED it! Since I am working from home during the pandemic these headphones blocked out ALL the noise that my child previously complained about when trying to work by using the loud/quiet switch on the control panel. As for the sound quality, it was crystal clear(It sounded like I wasn't even wearing headphones) and blocked out any background noise. In addition, the headset was EXTREMELY comfortable. Finally, the mini  control panel on the cord was super useful when we were watching a movie together, one person could pause/un-pause videos/take/receive calls, just with a few pushes of a button.  The only drawback was that my son felt that even when the headphones were opened to their largest setting, they barely fit him and may not fit him in the years to come. To conclude, the headset did everything that its packaging said it would. I would without doubt buy this for my other child.P.S. The pause/ start button DOES NOT work for youtube on a mac. I'm still not sure about other devices, but it does work for the iTunes application.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"I bought these for my 8 year-old daughter. She’s very happy with them for long days of wearing them for virtual classes at home during the coronavirus. She finds them to be very comfortable. We tried the LilGadgets Connect+ PRO, too. She found those to sound a bit better but after a while of wearing them her ear lobes hurt. She has not said the same of these MPOWs after several days. My 4 year-old son also thought the MPOWs were more comfortable.My one issue with these and the LilGadgets is that the sound wasn’t as good in the non-wired ear. Wiggling the wire improved the sound at times. We returned them both, got another pair of the MPOWs, and so far so good. There seems to be a wiring issue in some of them. But because Amazon’s return and replace is so easy, we got the new pair pretty quickly, when we really needed them. Fingers crossed the wiring is okay. I’d give them five stars without the wiring issue, but since others have run into this, it’s clearly a thing people need to know about.",4,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"We’ve tried a lot of headphones up in these parts. Too many of them mysteriously stop working within a month of receipt. I suspect it is mostly do to a poor job connecting the wires to the sound jack. In any case, these headphones do an awesome job of cancelling sound and limiting volume. They are soft on my kids’ ears and come in enough colors to make almost any choosy kid happy. Order arrived quickly and exactly as described. I chose these MPow headphones based on their volume limiting capabilities and am pleased with the quality thus far.",5,1,2020-7-28,1,1,0
We've had these headphones for a month and have used them with normal use going into week two of virtual school. My daughter is hearing static feedback and the volume keeps fluctuating. Her teacher could hear her at first now they can't hear her either with the headphones in. I've checked everything and can't tell what the problem is. Of course this all happened one week past the returnable date!,2,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"I have tried several headphones for my son but they were always too big for him and kept slipping off.  I was delighted when I found these Mpow's! I read a bunch of reviews and everyone seemed to love them and now I know why.  They are well built, fit him perfectly and love the ability to limit the sound so he doesn't make it too loud. I also LOVE that you can plug another pair of any type of headphones into the one ear and both share the sound.  Perfect for watching movies on his iPad together.  Also great that it has a mic built in as he will be using these for his Google Meetings for online school this year.  Bravo Mpow!",4,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"These headphones work well and my son has said he can’t hear me when he has them on, so the noise cancelling abilities must work well. The only concern I have is about the chord staying into the actual ear part of the head phone. If it’s tugged at all, it has some give. Hence the 4 stars instead of 5.",4,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"I ordered two pairs for two of my kids for virtual schooling. One pair works fine. The other the teacher is unable to hear my daughter speaking. It is not a chromebook issue, it seems to be the headphones themselves. Both kids find them comfortable. It is hard to have tech issues with a 6yr old because they don't always let you know something is amiss.",3,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
It is comfortable and looks cool and my son really loved it. But the sound started getting choppy soon after it was received.  It is filtering out voices if there is any sort of music in the background. If you twist the audio jack around sometimes a word or two will filter in. So hopefully it can still be used for its intended purpose (schooling and teacher meetings) but it is worthless to listen to music or videos.,2,1,2020-4-27,1,1,0
"I purchased two sets for my toddlers (4yo & 5yo) for a long road trip. They seem really comfortable.  Love the fact that it's adjustable so they can grow into them, they seem to be noise cancelling, and the maximum volume allowed is controlled for little ears.  I love the fact that it has a pause/play button, also.  Great buy.",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"I have other MPow products, which is why I bought these for my son (age 6, 1st grade) .My son uses them for distance learning. I haven't had the chance to use them myself... However the build quality seems great, like my other MPow stuff... And my 6yo son says they're very comfortable.",5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"We're gearing up for distance learning (cue crying), and the school said that headphones would make the video calls very helpful so we ordered these. My 4 year old loves the color and was thrilled to listen to music on them. She loved that she and her sister could listen to something at the same time, so they had a dance party together.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"Great headphones especially for the price! I bought these for my son to use on his Teams meetings for remote learning.  It had to have a mic and be cushioned.  These are super cushioned and comfortable.  They are big enough for my 8 year old and can get small enough for my 5 year old.  Only thing I'd like to have seen is a true volume control with a slider,  but there is a decibal control and on/ off for sound output on the cord which is nice.  Overall,  great purchase! Will be looking for a girls' style for my daughter!",5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,1
"Got this for my kindergartener to use during remote learning. They're comfortable for him, the microphone works well, the cord seems nice and durable, and they can get loud enough for him with no problem. Bonus for coming in Seahawks colors - we aren't football fans, but they're popular with the other kids!",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"Perfect fit for my 3yr old. They seem comfortable and not too loud for little ears. I went with the corded version to save money but if I had the choice again, I'd go cordless. The cord gets twisted, my son pulls it out by mistake or it detaches when the device falls and it's a pain to keep plugging back in. Just a personal preference. Other than that, a great buy for the price.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"The volume control is great as video, music and media sources are mixed at higher volume than ever - a deliberate choice to make an impact and engage the consumer. These allow parents to control that and volume limit is at 85 dB with a max of 94 dB. Great for general audio and music, online learning applications. Also - if you have more than one child using these, you can connect the headphones together so they can quietly listen to the same source. That is fantastic. Simple, older feature - few headphones support that these days. These really are designed for kids and smaller heads, if you are an adult with a smaller frame or head it might work, otherwise get an adult sized headset.",4,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"We have ordered 2 pair of these headphones (Blue and lilac). They are very nice looking and feel like good quality. The kids (1.5 and 6 years old) can put them on/off by themselves and they seem comfortable.I had to give 4 stars instead of 5 because 1 set has stopped working after about a year, but I think MPOW is sending me another set under warranty. Overall great purchase for the price and super stylish.",4,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
These headphones have helped a lot now that we are doing virtual learning.The background noise that she can hear is minimal when wearing them and I love the fact that there is a max volume for the headphones.  Hoping they hold up well when toting them back and forth to day care.,5,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
"We used them for an airplane ride with my 3.5 year old and 18 mo old. Three year old wore them for an entire movie without complaining once. 18 mo old did periodically pull them off when they started slipping (little big for him), but overall did much better than I expected him to do with headphones. I know some reviews complained about volume not being loud enough with airplane noise, but we didn't have that problem. It was plenty loud for the two of them and I could hear fine when I tested volume during airplane. However, my kids are little so they aren't exactly watching dialogue heavy shows :). Loved that the one set plugged right into the other set of headphones so we didn't need a headphone splitter. I just sat them together on one airplane seat, sharing the iPad together--- I'm not saying the airplane ride was a breeze, but that at least kept them entertained for a while. Definitely recommend. We will be taking them on all of our future airplane rides.",5,1,2018-12-11,1,0,0

"I bought 2 of these for my kids to use at their school’s computer lab. Schools closed down because of covid and they were kept there until this past August. My kids have been using them for remote learning and I noticed that the cables are not very durable. Both earphones have the exact same issue. The cords started to get twisted and tangled. In consequence the cloth that covers the cords have ripped in different areas, and now the cords are bent and broken. I know they were cheap, but I was expecting a better quality.",1,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"I purchased these two weeks ago for my kids to use for online classes. So far so good. I love the decibel/volume control. If you're looking for something with bass and all that forget it.

This is the 2nd pair of these i have purchased. I purchased these for my son for school. The first pair broke but it had nothing to do with the quality of the headphones. Had to do with a 8 year old getting a little wild. The fit is great. The're very comfortable with soft cushions. Should last my son the school year and then some.,5,1,2019-9-4,1,1,0

"These headphones worked perfect for the first few weeks but soon after that sound started breaking, echoing. Something went wrong even with mouthpiece, sound stopped going. It has become a big trouble I will have to buy new headphones for my son because these are of no use now. His online classes are becoming frustating because of these headphones. No use. After reading the old reviews I had thought it will be a good product but its not.Edited: The customer service is awesome. 1 week after this review they sent me new pair in mail. Thank you so much. The new one is working great as of now.",1,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"I got this for virtual school. It works well with my child's Chromebook-both the headphones and the microphone. I'm having trouble using it with my other kid and an old MacBook--the headphones work, but the microphone doesn't work. I don't fault the headphones, that computer just needs a USB connector. The price is great, they seem comfortable, and my kids like them. Just make sure you know what will work with your machine!",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
I'm so amazed at the quality and sound of these headphones! I got them for my grand-daughter because ear buds hurt her ears and are hard to put on her. They seem to be quite well built. And they fold up for easy portability. You can't beat the price! Delivered the next day with Amazon Prime.,5,1,2019-7-4,1,3,0
"Worked well for a few months then the audio began cutting out before they quit working altogether. My son likes the style and fit of these so we ordered a new pair. Hopefully the new ones make it longer than the last ones. These are headphones that are used at school, so I have no knowledge of how they are treated there. Giving the headphones the benefit of the doubt with the 3 star rating.",3,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"My kids love these (4 &7).  They initially had the kids gear headphones.  My son would complain that they hurt his ears and would always take off his glasses when wearing them.  I'm so glad I replaced them with these,  they are comfy,  fit over the ears, and the cord has the knit protective cover around it.",5,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0
"This is a nice inexpensive set of headphones for a little kid. They're not exceptionally durable-feeling, but at this price point I'm happy with the quality. They fit well on my toddler.

Bought this for my 2 year old as we will be going on vacation and he will need headphones for his tablet and he loves it. the cord is durable so far as my son has bit it multiple times and they still work. My only complaint is i wish they were alittle slimmer. My son has a big head and these barely fit on his head while he is in his car seat. Other then that they are great!,5,1,2019-7-30,1,0,0
"My kid loves it and said it is very comfortable to use. I got it for her to use for extended periods what with having to do online schooling due to the situation with the pandemic currently.

"These are perfect for toddlers! The cord is a material that won't fray or stretch like the classic rubber you find on most head phone cords.

"My little one (age 5) seems the like the headphones. They are large enough to cover his ears without bothering him or applying too much pressure. They noise canceling must work well because when I attempted to speak to him, he certainly acted like ge couldn't hear me! Maybe that was him ignoring me? Lol. The headphones appear to be a great quality and I would definitely recommend to others.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0

"I bought these in Jan for my daughter for her new school that she transferred to. She used them at school until beginning of March when schools shut down due to COVID, in May I picked them up from her school since they never resumed for the year. She began using them at home and one day the cords literally just pulled out from the sound adjustment on the cord. Very disappointed in the quality. They were great, but would expect a little higher quality when it comes to kids. My daughter is 8 and takes care of her items so I'm a little at a loss.",2,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"Nice-looking, comfortable  headphones for our kids to use at school and on zoom at home. However, one of them broke after about 9 months of use. Of course it was handled by kids so adult handling would probably allow the product to last longer. But it is a kids product.",4,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
My kid loves the color and fit!  Out of the box these seem like good quality especially compared to other headphones aimed at kids.  The size adjustments are smooth and secure so I don’t think these will fall off easily. I also appreciate the inclusion of a switch for the volume limiting function in case a grown up wants to use them at normal levels.  Sound quality itself is pretty good with good bass and enough noise reduction from the ear pads to discourage cranking up the volume in the first place.  A nice bonus feature is the inclusion of an extra output jack so you can share with a second set. These paired with the upgraded Roku remote are perfect.,5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"Very basic headphones. There’s a switch for volume control of 94DB or alternatively, 84DB. The headphones aren’t noise canceling for me, but I’m an adult. My kids like them. I think they’re great for what they are and work well for distance learning.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
Raised to 5 🌟.  After posting my comments below I was sent a new item.  Warranty and customer service is pretty good.Was perfect for a few months then it stopped working so I am knocking it down a couple stars.,5,1,2019-9-24,1,1,0
"The volume control is great, loud enough so my kids can still hear the music/movie over the car noises but not too loud to hurt their ears. Very soft ear foam with thick durable material. They fit my 18 month old - my 6 year old with no issues and very easy to adjust.",5,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0

These are perfect for my little guy.  He chewed the cord of his last pair (not this brand) so one of the ears stopped working.  The cord is not plastic material- it’s soft (I don’t know the material) like a thick cloth so I don’t foresee him breaking these if he does chew them,5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
We’ve bought several pair of these headphones and will keep coming back for more (my kids are HARD on headphones and them breaking is no fault of the headphones).

My kids have used these for only a few weeks of distance learning and the microphones on both headsets I ordered have stopped working.

Kids are headed back to school and are hybrid. We needed something that was much more obvious that they were plugged in and listening.

My 4.5 year old almost immediately pinched his hand in these when folding them up. He couldn’t get his hand out and was hysterical. I tested it myself and got a very painful pinch. I don’t care about sound quality if it’s that easy to get hurt on these junky headphones.,3,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
I have been a loyal MPOW customer since I first tried their lower end bluetooth headsets. Because of that and a recommendation from one of the podcasts that I listen to (Destination Linux) I tried these out.The sound quality is great and the music sharing feature is awesome.

"No real volume control. Sound quality is ok but can be wonky a occasionally, I have figured it was school lent Chromebook that was causing the issue. I can hear things still so the noise canceling isn’t really working. I haven’t tried the connection feature but that is because I bought on pair. They fit my kid nicely and adjust to fit myself. I actually would buy again because they are very looking and held up though out quarantine school.",3,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
I purchased blue for my 3 yo son and pink for my 8 yo daughter and they love their new headphones. No more arguing over devices because they can both share and listen in and it helps being that I work from home. I like how you can adjust the sound as well. Great buy/highly recommended.,5,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"My daughter loves these headphones. Unfortunately, we got a puppy and she found them on the floor. The cord was a perfect chew toy. So, we are on our second pair. Now the cord is covered in nylon and is fused to the headphones now. You used to be able to take the whole cord off. I like that you can connect them together, too. Great headphones for kids!",5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
I bought these for my 2 1/2 year old for a flight. We have gone yet but he loves them. I like that they fold up and that the cord isn't plastic that could break. I tried on the headphones myself and they're pretty comfortable. I'll update this review if my thoughts change after our family trip.,5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"I got these headphones for remote learning for my 7 year old. They are both cute and comfortable! And best of all, my other kids can’t hear distracting noise coming from the headphones while she is working! We loved them so much, we purchased a second color for my son. And I didn’t realize until after I bought them that you can link the headphones together so you can hear out of one headphone jack!",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
Great headphones! I was looking for a cheaper pair for my 10 year old seeing he goes through a couple pairs a year. These are amazing for the price. The sound is great and he says they’re very comfortable. Microphone works well too. So happy I found these!,5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"These headphones are really great for the price, I've purchased 3 MPOW products and they all work really well, and are sturdy. These headsets can connect to each other and share the audio feed from a device which is really nice.",5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"Ordered as a replacement for other headphones that the kids broke. These are much more comfortable on their ears, fold down nicely for storage and have a built-in audio jack so that you can have multiple headphones listening to the same device without needing a separate splitter, which we have found handy for car rides. Highly recommended.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"So far after about two weeks of use the headphones will get the job done.  Ive bought other headphones and they've broken within a week or so, but these are holding up great.  The noise cancellation has been phenomenal, even to the point my kids don't hear me calling there name in the same room.  The only down side is, Ive had to come and recheck the connection to the computer at times, it can slip out easily and my kids complain they cannot hear.  I'd definitely buy them again.....",4,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"Perfect for my young kids, I tested the loudness and it does go loud, but not incredibly loud where you’d have to worry about their ears/hearing. My son can attest to their noise canceling when I call him and he can’t hear me haha.",5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"Tween says they are, ""very comfy"" and it's ""Five stars all around!"". The color choices are nice. Works very well. Bought the headset for distabce learning on a Chromebook. It also works on XBOX One controllers and Dragon Touch tablet. Bought one in another color for the youngest for distance learning. My children's entropic nature hasn't destroyed them yet and that's a win in my book. Still bought the warranty just in case.",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"They're nice looking and feel good, and they're volume limiting like I wanted. The sound quality is lacking when compared to what I would buy for myself, but I think that's pretty much expected at this price point and I imagine the volume limiting plays a part too. My young daughter is happy with them.",4,1,2018-6-4,1,1,0
"We ordered 2 sets of these for our kids for school. They are great! When opening the box you will see right away one of our favorite components, these are collapsible...which is great for storage!

"My 5 year old loves these headphones. They fit his head perfectly,  nicely cushioned. The cable very resistant with a fabic meses coating, perfect since my little one likes to chew on the cable when he uses headphones.

"This headphone is different from other brand (we purchased different brands for the kids before, those were cheaply made and broke in couple days). Mpow CH6S is much more comfortable, foldable, and adjustable. The kids love the headphone and wear it all the time. The sound quality also sounds great, which just fit my kid needs.",5,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0

"My five-year-old loves them...from the color options (she picked her favorite) to the softness of headphones (perfect for not hurting a young child's sensitive head) to the quality of sound, these headphones are a bargain at the price. The conveniently located microphone has helped her to be better heard by the teacher, and the headphones make sure that she gets quality sound from Zoom, YouTube, and the other resources used without allowing it to ever get too loud for her. She loves them, and they have definitely upped our game while we have to school from home...",5,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
Bought for my granddaughter.  She loves them.  Very comfortable - nicely padded.  I bought due to the new online school experience starting this fall.  They seem to cancel most of the background noise for her.  Good product for a good price.,5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0

These headphones were perfect for my kiddos. They loved that they could watch a movie together or on their own with ease. They were the perfect size for their heads and comfortable. They are durable and well made. We had a problem with the first set and the company was quick to send another pair right alway. Very pleased!,5,1,2019-5-10,1,0,0
Works fine for what we need. Got them originally for online school during the pandemic and also long car rides. Only bad this is that they are almost too small for my 5 year old but he likes them. He will grow out if them fast but as long as he takes care of them it will go to his younger brother 🤞,4,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
My daughters second pair we love them and seller is a pleasure to work with. Only reason I gave 4 stars was the first pair cracked after only a couple months but seller quickly fixed the problem. I would defiantly buy again.,4,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0

"Got these for my daughter to use for her Distance Learning for this school year. The colors are exactly as shown and they don't feel cheap at all.

"This product is perfect. My kid is super picky when it comes to headphones but she says these are so comfortable and she can hear perfectly. We bought them specifically for virtual learning to block out noises and distractions around us, and this product does just that. The added bonus is the microphone so she can respond to her teachers accordingly. I would hands down, recommend these headphones.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,1
"We originally got these for a road trip so I didn't have to hear kids music or shows for 15 hours. It's been almost 3 months since I purchased these and they work so well. They fit his head perfectly, can even fit mine too. They come with a warranty too which is awesome. Definitely would recommend this product!",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
The box the headphones were in had been crushed and ripped open when we got them today. I plugged them in and the audio is a little fuzzy. I’m not sure if the sound quality is because the headphones were damaged when the box was damaged or if they always had poor audio.,1,1,2020-8-12,1,0,1
"The cord started breaking a couple weeks after only light use. As of now, they’re still working. But I’m a little disappointed that the cord isn’t a little sturdier for headphones made specifically for children.Update: I was contacted by the seller and they graciously sent another pair of headphones! Wonderful customer service! My son is enjoying his new headphones to the maximum!",5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
My three year old loves these headphones. The fit is excellent on his head and the ear cushions are super soft. My only two complaints are the braiding on the cord soant hold up (see pic) and the volume limiting switch should be aced in a more obscure location so he can't easily change it on his own.,3,1,2020-6-6,1,1,1
"Ordered these for my kids to use with their PS4 and tablets. So far they love them. With my daughter's old headphones she used to complain that would hurt after using them because they were too loud, with these I don't have to worry about that.

I needed something that was comfortable for them to wear for hours at a time, canceled out surrounding noise and most importantly protected their ears. These headphones have all of it. My boys found them super cool and are able to adjust them if necessary on their own. They are not heavy at all. I was researching for safe headphones for days and days. i was happy to have found these and highly recommend these.",5,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0

"Bought these headphones for my toddler girl for traveling. I was looking for something that had the feature with a safe volume control and these definitely do just that. I like the fact that the earphones part are foldable; therefore, more easily compact to travel. These have a great quality sound and I love the soft cushion on them. Glad I took my time to look and I see why the reviews are great. Will definitely recommend to others I know looking for headphones for their little one.",5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
We loved them for my son to use at school! He only used them a handful of times in kindergarten so with Elearning this year I was excited we already had these headphones in perfect condition. They worked great until last week when the sound on the left side randomly stopped working... the cord is in perfect condition and I’ve tried in Seperate devices so I know it’s the headphones and not the actual Device. We loved these but just sucks they stopped working out of the blue in the middle of e learning :(,3,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0

I highly recommended for young age children.",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"These are really comfortable for my 8yo. Love that it has the microphone for distanced learning, and also really helpful that it has an additional jack to add another set of headphones.

Perfect for my 2nd grader to take to school.  I love that they fold up nicely and then come in a small box which i could put in his backpack for safe keeping.  I would order these again for sure.  Another great thing was that they were comfortable.  There is a soft padding for little heads.,5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"These headphones are a game changer! Our 4 year old loves his tablet- but we don't love hearing it constantly throughout the day. This solves that issue! It helps him focus more on what he's watching and yet, he's still able to hear me when I call him. I love that it has volume limitations in place as well!",5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,1
"We just got these today. The kids were SO excited to try them out! they look nice, and feel soft! However, already the sound is not coming in consistently. It will play in one ear and not the other, then switch back to the other.  If I jostle the plug it will come in both ears for a minute and then go back to one ear or the other. Frustrating! With distance learning I need several pairs of headphones, but I will be looking else where... bummer. If it improves I will update.",3,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0

"Got these for my 2.5 year old right before a travel trip. He now asks ""where my headphones?"" I'd say that's a win. I was curious to see how they would do on the noisy plane and although not noise cancelling, they still provided good sound. They fit his little head on the smaller setting and my big ole head on the bigger setting lol.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
These are great. Iv bought multiple different kids headphones off of Amazon and I really like that the cord is a separate piece with this set. We have a cat that likes to chew wires on occasion and I've had to toss a few sets before as the wire and headset were all in one. The sound is great and the volume control is perfect.,5,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0

"My 8yr old daughter loves these headphones!!! They’re comfortable and fun to wear.  She uses them primarily for distance learning.  She also uses them when we travel in an airplane.  The cool and convenient thing with these headphones is that she can connect her headphones with her little sister’s headphones when they want to watch the same show on the iPad. This avoids fights and arguments and both girls are able to share the iPad. As a parent, I would definitely recommend these headphones.",5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0

"These headphones are great for elementary aged kids to use during virtual learning.  Good quality and sound, comfortable, and easy to plug in.  I ordered two pair (the blue and the aqua green) for my kindergartener and 3rd grader.  Great product for the money!  The only problem is that the kindergartener does a lot of songs/dancing so he sometimes wraps himself in the cord - so if you need to be more mobile, maybe consider a cordless option.  Otherwise they are great and getting the job done well!",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"Purchased this for my grand daughters to go with the tablets I was giving them for Christmas. They used them on the drive from south Texas back to Canada after the holidays, and according to my daughter, they worked perfectly. They must have been comfortable as the girls, ages 3 and 5, wore for several hours each day without complaints. It allowed the adults in the car to listen to the radio and visit while the girls were quietly entertained. Have also used several times since when having to accompany Mom to work, and again worked well. My daughter actually asked me to give these a good review as they have been so useful. It's only been 2 months of use but have been well worth it so far.",5,1,2019-2-17,1,0,0

My wife and I bought two of these for our twin sons. I like that the volume is controlled and can’t be turned up way too loud. I also like the over the ear design.

Our boys have learned so many words and concepts.,5,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0

Just received these and tested them out prior to the start of the school year. They hooked up to Zoom seamlessly and were very clear in both the hearing and the microphone.

My 8 year old daughter liked it a lot and She use it for about 1-1:5 hours everyday.The color is beautiful as on photo; the item smooth and easy to adjust. The noise cancellation and sound quality is very good. And it is great value for money.,5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
Great for 7-8 year old. Used in on an airplane ride long ago. Now using it for homeschooling which is perfect. The noise canceling helps so he’s not easily distracted.,5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
The sound quality is pretty good and I love that you can connect two of those together so that the kids can share the same music. The problem is that the foam padding over the ear makes the headphone unbearably hot. I tried them myself and couldn't tolerate them for more than a few minutes. My 7- and 5-yr olds have also been complaining about how the headphone makes their head hot and don't want to use them anymore.,2,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0

I bought one pair for my daughter. She loved them so much I bought a second for my son. These are perfect for small ears. They are adjustable in both size and volume control.

I think overall her learning experience just got better! I recommend buying these great product.",5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
These worked well for a 9 and 6 year old during 10000 zoom calls this spring. The only downside is after a while they would bother my daughters ears because of her earring backs. but for shorter use she loved them!,5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0

"We bought this for our daughter's online school, fits her really good. It has a good noise canceling quality without it being too high for her age (6YrOld).  The only thing I would have liked to see is the ability to increase or decrease the volume from the headset, the button it has just makes it easier to block higher noises around her.

They are great for what they’re designed for (children). I like the volume control switch. I would’ve rated five stars if these earphones would have the Bluetooth function added. I knew before head they didn’t but I wanted to try them anyway. They look well made and nicely padded and comfortable on the speakers section.

"These work great for my three and four year olds who use them with their Kid Fire tablets.  The ability to connect the two sets together has come in handy when one tablet was low on battery or forgotten, as they were able to share.

Bought this for my 10-year-old to use for online school. Had already tried another brand for kids that was more expensive and they did not fit her head and were of poor quality. These conform much better to kids' heads and you can feel the solid quality right out of the box. Mic sound was good and so was the sound when listening to music. I like the volume control switch.,4,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0

So far, I would definitely order these again.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
Good quality. I like the cord that doesn't seem like it will tangle or break very easily. I also like that I can plug in my earbuds and hear what he is hearing.

Great set of headphones! Headphones with a mic was required for e-learning and these surpassed my expectations! The sound quality is great and the mic is at the perfect spot on the cord so it does not need to be held to the mouth when speaking.

Fits my ten year old - he’s got a big head so it might not forever but I’m pleased. They are really comfortable and I love the sound limit. They do reduce noise but not cancel it. Enough to be used in the car on a long trip. Love the folding feature and I also bought a case for it to stay safe on trips. I plan for them to be used for virtual learning and the microphone should hopefully work well for that. Pleased enough to buy a second pair for my second child.,5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0

"The best kids headset I've found. Super comfort on head and ears area. Noise limiting on the sturdy rope like cord.

And the feel of the quality is pretty good too! The price was cheap and I'm glad the quality wasn't cheap either. These are good/decent earphones when you don't want your kid to take his nice expensive headphones to school and run the chance of getting stolen or broken.,5,1,2019-9-12,1,0,0
"not working properly after sitting there for two month. purchased at the end of june, got the item at the begining of july when school is out to prepare for the semester. it was only used 3 times during the summer. now class is started but the headphone is not working. so disappointed.  also the volume limitted is broken since day one, when you turn the volume turns high it goes high not limited to what it said 85/94.",1,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0

I got these headphones for my preschool-aged daughter for an upcoming trip. We've tested them out at home and she loves how they block out the noise so she can hear the movie or music. I like the volume feature and we both like that another set of headphones can be piggybacked onto hers. I also think the folding feature is nice but wish there was a case or some way to keep them folded for transporting.,5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
Love this and the kids do too. Great for when they are sharing an iPad and both need head phones- one can plug into the others headset and listen at the same time. Great for traveling to which we do a lot of.,5,1,2018-6-12,1,1,0

These are comfortable. I bought them for my son who happens to have a smaller head. It fir perfectly AND comfortably! Ears adjust and move up and down with head.The only thin I don’t like is that the volume doesn’t go lower for highest measure.

"These are good, but the downside is that you have to hold down a button in order to use the mic. I bought these for my son so he could record while filming on his tablet, but he can’t for that purpose because he needs one hand to hold down the button.

"I got these months ago, so I'm out of luck to get a 3rd set from the vendor. I love these little headphones and my kids love them. However, within days of first giving them to my twins for their birthdays hers broke. My husband, not knowing any better threw them away so I had nothing to return. However, the company was great and sent us a replacement for hers when they heard that hers broke. So they get an extra half a point for working with us the first time around. But here we are again, the pink ones broken again. Only one of the speakers works so only half of the sound is coming through, most of the time music comes through but no dialogue from videos. My daughter is so sad bc this happened to hers twice. She isn't treating them poorly or throwing them around. She's gentle with her things, so I know it's not that.

"I got these for my 5 & 8.5 yo, they loved them at first. They are cute and comfortable for their small kid sized heads. The plug into each other option is great. I get it, I don’t want to damage my kids hearing, but they are way too quiet. My kids could barely hear when they were watching something on their kindle. I can’t imagine using them on a plane. No way would you be able to hear what you’re watching. I would not recommend. Honestly kind of useless if you can’t hear with them.",2,1,2018-11-19,1,1,0
With 3 kids home virtual learning headphones were needed. I didn't think of it before school started because each one would be in a different room but I found that me walking around could be distracting. We got one pair of these to try it out on the one kid that needed it the most. They are exactly what we needed. She's 6. They fit her well. I love that the cord isn't wrapped in plastic but instead some thick cloth material. I tested the volume myself so I know they won't blow out their own eardrums. Mic works great. They are not a cheap pair of headphones. They are padded well for a child's head. The sound is on point. and it doesn't look like they'll snap in half the first time they open them up to put them on. So it's a win all around. Going to keep an eye out for other MPOW products now,5,0,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"I am a principal at  Kindergarten and 1st grade building.  We often have kids who don't have headphones for technology class and had bought many different ones to have as extras and none held up very well.  We decided to spend a little more and purchased a dozen of these headphones and they've lasted ALL year!  Most are used up to 6x per day for about 30 minutes at a time and the kids are pretty rough on them.  Again, they've all lasted all year long.  We plan to purchase some more so that teachers will have an extra set in their classrooms as well.  Highly recommend for parents who are looking to purchase a pair for their child as part of their school supply list as they are so durable.",5,0,2019-4-23,1,0,0
"Three stars because the sizong is wrong.  The oroduct states that it will fit uo to a 16-year-old, but it is too small for my 11-year-old thin daughter.  They barely fit my 9-year-old daughter.Otherwise, they are comfortable and work well.",3,0,2020-9-23,1,0,0
My kids are obsessed with these headphones. They say the volume is great and they cancel out the other noises from the room. They are very comfy on their head/ears as well.

I called my mom to try out the mic, she said it isn't great but that she can hear me. I sent a few voice notes and it was okay quality.

"Ordered these for my 3 yr old. Fit was great, love the sound sharing feature. However sound only worked on one side, not both earphones. So I assumed, just a product defect.  I returned 1st pair and got a replacement 2nd pair.  2nd pair is ALSO defective. Sound comes through very distorted and shorts out on one side. Tested the sound device with other headphones and confirmed the problem was with these headphones. Not once, but twice!!! I do love this design and the idea of these for my son, I just wished they actually worked!!",1,1,2019-8-22,1,0,0
Received item and only one side worked.  Returned to amazon.  Got a 2nd pair and the same problem except this time you could giggle the cord and it would work a little.

"These were a godsend. They fit our toddler (21 month old) really well and she enjoyed using it on the plane. The sound quality is great. Some people worry about it getting too loud but we didn’t find this to be a problem at all. The cushions on the earpieces and the top of the headband were super comfy and soft. The aux cable can be plugged in to either side of the headphones so that was nice, too. They also fold up so you can stow them easily! The color is super cute and our toddler loved using it on our 3 hour plane ride. We are so so so happy with these!!!*One tip I would share (if your kids don’t use headphones) is to have “training” sessions for five or so minutes daily prior to a long trip like ours so your baby can get used to it. Our toddler doesn’t watch much TV or use electronics. This meant we had to kind of teach her how to use headphones and the concept of them needing to stay on.",5,1,2019-4-23,1,2,1
"I was excited to see a newer model as we already have a pair that has lasted 2 years (including being at school for an entire year). I wanted to have a pair for home and school but this one -- (tested on ipad, iphone and pc) simply doesn't work. it doesn't pick up voice tracks. it picks up the loudest music tracks which are garbled at best. I'm really disappointed as the headphones themselves are comfy, and from our past experience i know can be quite durable.---UPDATE---8/26/19---",5,1,2019-8-19,1,1,0
"I hate to not give these guys a good review because I actually love the product (well my kids love them).  The feel like they are well made and the fit nice, sound good enough and they have a built in mic.  That's all great and we had 2 pairs that worked fine for about a year....  1 pair failed a few months ago (less than a year owned) and after contacting their support, they were out of stock so refunded my money.  Figuring I got a lemon and got good responsive and fair customer service, so no big deal.Fast forward to today and now our 2nd (older) pair have also failed!  Luckily they have a 24 month warranty (which is fantastic compared to others) and while I'm happy with their response it's the same situation, e.g. out of stock so how about a refund? Normally this would be fine but because everyone is buying this item now the price has gone from $13 to $25 due to price gouging.  I am happy they are honoring the warranty but 2 bad pairs speaks to very poor build quality.  Maybe I got unlucky but buyer beware.",2,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
"Update again: Six months after purchasing these, the right side speaker has died. Not too bad considering they are used often in the classroom, but not great. They are physically holding up and are still very comfortable, but my daughter won’t use them anymore since she can only hear out of the left side.Update: I stand somewhat corrected. When my daughter’s teacher gave me the headphones the next day after telling me they were broken, it appears my daughter had chewed them! So, that is why they stopped working and is not the fault of the headphones themselves, per se. However, the wire provided on the pink headphones is a faux leather plastic that is easy to chew, bend, pinch, etc. It isn’t durable and won’t last long for most kids. The one plus on this cord is that it is removable and therefore replaceable.",3,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
Works well for kids. My kids drive me crazy in the car with their iPad sounds so I purchased 3 of these for some Dad sanity.In the past I would give them ear buds but the would crank them up and I feared they would damage their hearing.,4,1,2019-9-2,1,1,0
"We purchased these for my son's upcoming remote school year -- hoping that they would limit the volume level as promised.... they do not.I tested these with numerous devices -- on my PC, on a samsung phone, and on a chromebook.  We cranked the audio up with each one of these and tested it.  It doesn't limit the audio - actually hurt my ears lol  Sure the sound sounds pretty good -- but if you're purchasing this to ensure that your little ones don't blast their ears.... I'd try a different brand.",1,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
I was surprised when I first opened the package. I was expecting cheap looking headphones especially for the price I paid but instead found these gorgeous looking headphones. The headphones have a rubberized texture to them making them look and feel more expensive. The ear pads are very soft and comfortable and I love the braided cable. I wasn't expecting much in terms of sound quality but when i tried them out I was surprised they actually sounded good. As a musician I’m used to listening to $100 and up headphones. But these don't sound like cheap headphones at all. I would say they have similar sound to Apple Airpods. The headphones have a warm and airy sounding tone to them nothing like I was expecting at all for headphones in this price range and especially headphones for kids because who would make high quality sounding headphones for kids right? They don’t know what good quality sound is. I also love that they fold. Highly recommended!,5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"I love these headphones and so do my kids. You can tell they are made heavy duty, smooth material and has cushion where it sits on the head. The EarPods are nicely cushioned and feels great when on, even for long period of time. The sound is great because it has two decibles. It can also be used as noise canceling which makes the sound even better. The cord for the headphones are heavy duty. You can tell they are not cheaply made. The button where the mic is can be used to pause and play. It also comes with a jack input for music/sound sharing. I also love that I don’t have to worry about my kids hearing with these as they come with a volume limit max. The sound quality  in these are great! Great color options too. I needed these for my kids online schooling. These are perfect. They also come with 2 year warranty! Love it!",5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,1
These were great for my 4 and 8 year olds on a recent plane ride. Forced them to share one device so I had less to carry but work individually when they are doing their own things. They said they were comfortable and I love that they limit the volume to protect their little ears.,5,1,2018-5-29,1,6,0
"There were perfect little headphones for my 3 year old.  Softly cushioned and easy to use, he actually doesn't mind wearing these headphone versions some of the other ones we've attempted.  These are comfortable little solutions to your headphone problems.  The volume control is reassuring, knowing that he's not going to damage his ears this young.  The extra jack allowed me to connect on a regular headphone to check on his volume and content.  It's not perfect noise cancelling by any means, which is good when I need to get his attention, but it does reduce the sound so we can use it as ear protection sometimes since he's willing to wear it  And it's so affordable that I got a second pair to throw in the car.  I would recommend this over some of the cutesy ones that aren't as comfortable.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
“They were great at first but one month after we bought them one pair headphone completely died for no reason.  Now we can’t return them because there a set and we are just outside of the  return window 🙁”After I posted my original review the company contact me and sent me a replacement headphone for free.  I really appreciate them going out of their way for us and I’m hopeful that the headphones continue to work properly. I do really like that you can link the headphones together it’s wonderful when you have two children that want to share one device.,3,1,2019-2-14,1,3,0
"Perfect fit for my petite 5 year old.  With Distance learning in full effect (thx covid19).. we needed a nice set of headphones that would be cute, comfortable and produce good audio quality but not break the bank.  So far so good with the MPOW CH6s.  I got on a virtual meeting with her to test out the quality and these are pretty hard to beat for the price you pay, no need to hold the inline mic upto her face to hear clear crisp audio..  Added bonus, there is a toggle on the mic to switch between 85dB and 94dB for those of you concerned with the volume level.  Would have liked a volume control there as well but that's not really a show stopper here and actually may be easier to maintain proper volume levels for her anyway (less things to fidget with).  Id recommend this product for your little one.",5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,1
"We tested these on her chromebook through zoom and they worked great. The audio was crystal clear on both ends!! The microphone seems to pick up any background noise or voices. Great if you're worried about the mic picking up your voice without having to hold it close to your mouth, not great if you don't want your kid's entire class hearing you yell at the cat or the music you're playing in the background. But I think the important thing is the mic works very well.Other reviewers said that the cord comes loose from the headphones. The one we have is not removable. I don't have to worry about it being pulled out acidentally getting lost.",4,1,2020-9-15,1,0,1
"Remote schooling video lessons were riddled with screeches and shouts of excited children.  Gaaaah! I saw these headphones featured on Lovely Lucky Life as a good Easter basket gift. So in the Amazon cart they went! So far we are happy. Folding feature is great for stashing headphones in a basket. Two different levels of noise cancellation, a built in microphone, silky soft padded earpiece and buttery smooth (and wipe able) silicone like coating. The biggest plus for me is that you can Daisy chain these and plug into one device. Volume control is done on the device you’re plugged into by the primary headphone wearer. My kids listen to books on CD once a week with these as well as some Zoom/Meet calls twice a week. Still holding up well, even after being tossed about.",5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,1
"Update: The seller's customer service team reached out to me and sent a replacement set of headphones. So good on them for trying. However, they were exactly the same as the pair we'd received the first time. The box, the documentation inside the box, and the headphones themselves make NO MENTION of having a microphone, and no microphone is detectable on any of the devices we tried them on. It would seem that the seller is confused about the actual capabilities of these headphones. But, again, applause for good effort from customer service.Ordered these exclusively because we needed kids' headphones with a microphone for my daughter's online school. Although the Amazon description indicates in MANY places that there is a microphone, the headphones that came didn't have any discernible microphone, nor did the box or any of the documentation they came with mention a microphone in any way. We tested on multiple computers and none could detect a microphone. It would appear that either the listing is incorrect or we've received the wrong product. Returning immediately. If you're looking for headset with a microphone, don't buy these.",1,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"My daughter loved these headphones and gently used them once per week for about 6 months, prior to the COVID shutdown. They were stored in a bag and kept at school. We just went through her school supplies from last year (after getting them back from her school this summer) and they don't work. There is a crackling sound, the audio cuts in and out and you need to turn the volume on her Chromebook up all the way just to hear anything. We just bought new MPOW headphones for my son and the difference between the two is night and day. Hoping the new ones last longer than these did... didn't expect to buy a new pair every school year. Would suggest taking out an extended replacement warranty if you choose to purchase. Wish I did!",2,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"Compared the the Noot K11 headphones, these feel and sound more like toys than real headphones. The Noot ones have a more flexible band that allow all ages to use them comfortably, and have very good sound with deep base. These Mpows have very little base, and are a bit tight for older kids, and not really usable by adults.I do like the 45 degree angle plug on these - I'm thinking that may be more survivable - our last pair of Noots died due to the plug being yanked to the size and broken. The volume control is nice. It would be good to be able to lock it into the lower setting though, or at least make it easier to see when it's on high with a red indicator or something.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"I bought these for my 4 year old and he loves them. The material is durable and I like that the cord is braided so it doesn't fray. It folds into a very portable size for easy storage when he isn't using them and will easily fit in his backpack when we travel. I would definitely recommend that you purchase these for a kid! We had a pair of Sony wired on-ear headphones prior to this and they are beat up. I don't anticipate these looking as rough after 3 months of use. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because I don't think the volume limit works very well. When we unplugged his headphones, the volume was VERY high.",4,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"These headphones are top notch.  The build quality and materials are all high quality.  The detachable cord is great, when my daughter snags the cord it pulls right out.  The ability to share audio via headphone jack is also a plus, both my daughters can watch the same show with their headphones and not need an (easily lost) audio splitter.  I’m a huge fan of mpow almost every headphone is my house is mpow.  They make great stuff.",5,1,2019-11-10,1,1,0
"I bought these in pink, for my 7 year old, & they fit her perfectly, right out of the box. They look just like the picture, and arrived with a braided cord! I LOVE that if you have another pair, you can plug one set into the other, so both kids can listen to the same thing, at the same time. Saves on buying a splitter or extra cords, etc. Also, I love that there is an option to raise the decibel level, for noisier environments, but also can be kept at a lower level for regular use. I tried them on myself, and they even fit me, so they are truly great for all ages! And they really cancel out a lot of noise. They fold easily for travel, and appear to be great quality, at a great price. I bought another pair in black/blue, for my 5 year old. We love these headphones!",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"My 5 year old granddaughter was imitating me when she saw me listening to iTunes on his laptop.  She took her pink earmuffs and a piece of string and made believe she was doing the same as me.

You can never pay enough for the smile of a grandchild.

The kids think they are comfortable and, honestly, they can even expand to fit my adult head. Not only that, but they also fit my 1-year-old. So that was a pleasant surprise. I love the feature that we can connect multiple sets together. The kids love to listen to audiobooks, and I have a small cheapo mp3 player that I have loaded some books on to.

And it helps them know which ones are theirs in the sea of buds and black headphonesUpdate -- these have all stopped working! They worked one minute and then the next - just stopped. Super bummed. The first pair stopped pretty soon after purchasing. The second pair stopped about 18 months after purchase. Wish we could get them fixed or exchanged because my kids love them and they are comfortable for them!,2,1,2018-10-3,1,1,0
"These seem to be nice, sturdy headphones.  They fit my kids well and are adjustable so I can use them on my three year old and my seven year old.  The ear pieces are nice and soft and do well at keeping the noise out.  The sound is nice and clear and I love that they can be hooked together.  I bought three pair so my kids can listen to things all together.  My kids love the bright colors and I like that they fold up so it is less likely the headband will get broken in storage.  The microphone works great too.  The only thing I wish they would change is to let you lock the volume either to the safe DCB or to control it to any volume, like regular headphones.  But these are great headphones at a reasonable price.",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
I'm honestly not sure if we received a malfunctioning pair or if they are all like this. We ordered them so our daughter can do her school work during our upcoming trip. While we were testing them they unfortunately started making siri pop up and then shortly after it was making her music play. Originally I thought my daughter was pressing the button on the headphones by accident but after some investigation and trying it out myself it was the headphones doing it on its own.,2,1,2020-1-15,1,1,0
"The good: They’re cute. The colors are pictured well.  My kids each picked a different color. They seem to work well. One of the three we ordered ended up being delayed by about a week.  But they were overnighted and we received them in time for the first day of online learning!  Thank you so much for that.The con: The delayed headphones (light purple) had a dime-sized blob of GOOP on the ear cushion.  It wasn’t excess glue. Luckily, hubby was the one unboxing it and swiftly wiped the blob of gloop off.  (I would have just returned them immediately and had to deal with a disappointed 2nd grader). So...just be on the lookout when opening the product box!!!",4,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"Purchased two sets of these headphones for my kids as they head back to school for virtual learning with their computers. Wanted them to have headphones with microphones so that they can hear and be heard during their live meeting sessions. My kids love the colors. They say they are comfortable to wear and like the function that allows them to chain their headphones together when they might want to listen to something together on one of their ipads. All in all please with the quality and the price of these headphones. We are just starting in on the school year tomorrow, so hopefully these will hold up for the school year.",5,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"Got these for my kindergardener for virtual school. Hello 2020. They work very well and the volume limit is great for the kids, but too low for me to use. I didn't realize that they have a cushion on the top of the head- that was a nice surprise. they adjust very well and my son loves them. i just wish it had a microphone and a mute button. The switch that is on it is for answering phone calls and for controlling a music player. For the money I spent I am very happy.",4,1,2020-9-4,1,1,0
"They worked ok for awhile. The volume was never loud to begin with but I think that was because of the noise safety feature. Anyway, we bought these in May, and by July they only worked half the time. You’d plug it in the jack and had to turn it just right to get it to work. Not fun when you have a wiggly 3 year old who kept moving the cord and having the sound cut out again and again. Then we tried again on a trip in October and after awhile the sound cut out completely. These were only used 7-8 times total and now they’re completely broken. Only reason I’m giving them even 2 stars is because the durability (in terms of them not cracking) is great. Just wish they actually worked for more than 2 months.",2,1,2019-11-28,1,0,0
I am not using these myself. Bought for my kids who are doing school online. So far they are woking great. No issues with volume. Both kids want to take them off after a couple hours of wearing them because their ears get sore. I think this happens with all headphones. They need a screen break by then anyway! I can't say anything about the sound quality. I am pleased with my purchase.,4,1,2020-9-25,1,1,0
Update: the company sent a new pink headphones out and they do work better. The volume control for a child is satisfactory. The headphones are a little fragile still though as the blue headphones continue to come apart. We have been using these since August so they’ve had some rough adventures.The volume is very quiet. They are very fragile and will break easy. Not bad for the money we used on the plane to Florida and worked good for the trip but after the pink broke.,4,1,2018-11-21,1,2,0
"These are so cute!  They are super comfortable and adorable.  I bought them for one of my kids to do their school work during ""the pandemic"" so I wouldn't have to hear EVERY SINGLE THING the teachers were teaching.Sound cancellation is excellent - maybe a little bit TOO GOOD.",5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
In my original review I gave one star because of issues I had with product. However I contacted customer service and Laura was super helpful with the issues I had. She walked me through making checks of the headphone to verify the issue was not on our part. With this being said she went through and informed me that since the product was within warranty etc they would be shipping out a new device to me. It took a bit longer than expected but I had anticipated that with the current happenings. She even emailed me to let me know that (i)the item had been shipped as well as (ii) the anticipated arrival date and (iii) verifying with me to see if device was working. The fact that they were not rude and obnoxious as other customer service agents at other entities have been for other products. They will get my business again as to me it shows they care about the customer. We are wrapping up week two of using this device no issues this far.,5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"Seems to be made out of rubbery-er material than i expected, which is actually better for kids.  My daughter bends them and twists them around and they seem to be holding up to the abuse.  Only down side is that since these are on the bigger side they don't pack easily since the ear pieces don't fold in like my wireless head phones, in case you want to bring them somewhere.  Also the wire is reinforced where it connects to the headphones which is a good thing since apparently my daughter uses them as a part time lasso.",4,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
***UPDATE *** THE SELLER SENT ME A NEW HEADSET AND ITS WORKING GREAT!!  I must have got a dud the first try!  I have updated this review to 5 stars. My son moves it.  Thank you for taking it apon yourself to make sure i got a working product right away!!  Old review:  I bought this because my 2 year old likes to watch our Alexa Show and I needed to reduce the volume.  These headphones do nothing to reduce the volume I can hear the music from another room when they have the volume turned up.  There is no limiting happening. He loves turning the volume full blast and this was supposed to limit the volume  IT DOESNT.  I wish I could find the cheap $5 set I purchased before  they did the trick,5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
Size does not fit a child. Bought these for our daughter for our upcoming flights. Unfortunately we didn’t test them before our trip but They are heavy and when she looks down at the iPad they fall forward on her face because 1 they are too big for a child even though they are advertised for children and 2 the design is bulky and heavyShe was so frustrated with them and we ended up not being able to use them.,5,1,2019-5-6,1,0,0
"I ordered a Pink set and a Black/Red set for my 3 year old daughter and my 7 year old son and they love these.They fit their heads great, the volume limiting knob is great because at home they use the switch on the 85db limit and in the car or on a plane they can use the 94db limit.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
I bought these for my 7.5-year-old daughter. I tried them out myself and tested the noise cancellation by having my mother speak at me. I couldn't hear a thing she was saying while I had music playing on the headphones. They're extremely comfortable too. I just wish they offered a pouch to put them in. She will be using these on her iPad for remote learning. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. Will buy again in the future.,5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0
"Pretty impressed with these. I ordered one for my son for back to school. He hasn't really used them that much but did test them out. He couldn't hear me talking when he had them on and he said that the sound quality was pretty good. I would like to see how the microphone functions and how they play out in a month or so but so far, happy with my purchase. My son is 6 years old and the fit was perfect when extended.",5,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0
"Purchased these for virtual school b/c they appeared to be durable and the product title clearly stated the product included a microphone. Despite being advertised that way, we received a product that did not, in fact, have one. We did not know this until the first day of school when our daughter was unable to participate and meet her classmates because the product is not as advertised. Upon further inspection of the box, we saw that it advertises all the associated features of the product...but microphone wasn't one of them. The listing MUST be changed to reflect the actual features of the product. These may be great for sound, but don't use them to rely on anyone to hear you speak.",1,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"I was surprised this headset was made well for kids. I bought this for my 6yr old son to use when he watches movies on the coach over his tablet while we watch ours on big tv. It works well on him, and the best feature it has is volume management. It will not damage the kids ears. it has 2 db setting which both output well enough without over volume. My son would not accidentally over pump the volume as the final output is limited. Its a great buy!",4,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"We were using another pair of headphones for kiddo for a few years so it was time for an upgrade. She really likes them. Says they are comfy & she can hear well at the 85 level. Haven’t tried the microphone out yet, but I think it will work well for virtual school. The headphones have plenty of room for growth too. They fit her head & I can wear them which is great when checking volume.",5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"***update***So I originally said they were sturdy but she hasn't used them in a few months and used them the other day, accidentally dropped them and they broke. We've already had one replaced. She's not hard on them and barely uses them. I'm off to purchase a different pair.",3,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0
"As school has moved online for a lot of school districts, I needed something to help curb the noise level of the my kids different school classes and online learning applications. I came across these after seeing many of the reviews, and given their price, I felt like it was a good price point I could test them out on.I couldn't be happier. They are good quality for kids headphones, they have mics so they can interact on their online classes, the volume control has decimal limitation so they can't get too loud for the children ears. And finally the fact that they can daisy chain connect to have multiple headphones listen to the same audio source was a very welcome and pleasant surprise.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,1
"I have been really impressed by these headphones.  For the price, I wasn't expecting much, but I've been impressed so far.  We've only had them for a few days but they are not flimsy at all and seem to be really well made.  Maybe there is hope that the little monsters won't destroy them in a month or three.  The integrated microphone picks up their voices just right, the sound is clear, and the ability to link them is awesome (it wasn't something I was specifically looking for, but it is very cool).  The only thing I would change about them is to move the volume control switch to somewhere on the headset where it is less obvious to the kids who love to fidget with everything and believe that louder is always better.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"Due to the forced online schooling this year, we have lots of google meet calls. My 10 yo does not like the headsets, but we still needed something for her calls. These headphones are just right! she is so often uncomfortable and miserable with headphones, but these ones she loves! She gets on her calls each morning confident that these headphones will work. They are super comfortable, the sound is great and having a built in microphone is perfect!",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
I have a small head and they pinch my ears.  My 6yo has an abnormally large head and complains about them pinching his ears after an hour or two.  Sound is good.  Noise cancellation is acceptable.  Price was good.  I LOVE the extra jack on the ear piece. I have to listen in on most of his online classes (because he's only 6) so the extra jack is used daily. Glad I got these.,4,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"My kids love these headphones, if something happens to them, I would buy more!!! I might even buy as gifts. They are super soft on the top of head and around the ears. Fits my younger and older kids. They plug into each other's headphones and watch the same show on a kindle together. They love it! Super happy with the color choices too. They also fold up for easy storage in a backpack, ect. Highly recommend.",5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"I got these for my kids for a trip so they can use it on the plane. My son, who usually won't keep anything on his ears for more than 3 mins actually used these for the entire flight when he wasn't asleep, so I know that they're comfortable. I also tested the sound level at max volume and the limiter it excellent. I don't have to worry about my kids cranking up the volume to unbearable decibels. I also find the cushioning quite comfortable.  And tangle-free cords are a dream when trying to manage 2 young kids on a plane and bags. I highly recommend this product.",4,1,2018-12-30,1,0,0
"This is the second headphone we have from mpow, with the first one still functioning after almost 2 years with our son.  It fits his head really well and the ear padding is comfortable.  Yes there are cheaper headphones in some stores, but we really like the quality of the first one we bought so we got again from this brand. We have not tested the other functionality and I don't think my son will need to fiddle with it.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"Update: Mpow provided me a full refund, and also offered to replace these, so upgrading to 3 stars --- but you should know that if volume limiting is a concern these might not be good for younger kids.These headphones are way too loud, even on the 85dB setting.  Not suitable for smaller children!",3,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
I purchased these headphones for school in the blue and aqua for my 9 yr old son and 6 yr old daughter. They are super comfortable! The sound quality is better than any other pair of headphones we've owned. Easy to adjust the volume and overall they are great quality. I'm thinking about purchasing a second pair for home.,5,1,2019-8-19,1,1,0
"Comfortable headset , good sound quality for the price.  Microphone is on the wire, so the one downside is that if you are moving when talking, the microphone picks up the sound of the microphone rubbing against your shirt, making it hard for the other party to hear clearly.  When talking I have to hold the microphone away from my chest.",4,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
My 6 year old is using this for remote schooling while his 5 year old sister is remote in the same room.  These are very comfortable and do a great job canceling our noise.  The ability to port another headphone set is very useful.,5,1,2020-9-24,1,1,0
"Good headphones for the price! The dB level adjustment is great! We ended up getting  three of these. We love these headphones because they connect directly to each other, first one to fire tablet with dB set low then the other two plugged into each other with dB set high to compensate for volume loss when using multiple headphones. Quality seems good but time will tell if they hold up to the kids!",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"I purchased two pairs of these for my 6-year old twins when our schools closed down in March due to Covid-19. They finished out their kindergarten year and have been using them throughout the first three months of 1st grade and they are absolutely awesome! My kids are, as any parent of a 6-year old can attest to, a little rough on their belongings, but these have help up extremely well. The cords are sturdy and the material that goes over the head is durable, and folds for easy storage when we're done for the day. I would buy these again in a heartbeat, but it seems like I won't need to!",5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"It was purchased for my son to use at school. It was used minimally at school during their tech time under supervision so it was not used rough at all (only sitting at his table less than two hours a week for 3.5 months). It stopped working on one side so he brought it home and while I was checking it out, the connection was bad so it would only come out on one side. I had a chat with amazon and was told they only offer a 45 day warranty (which should have been a red flag that I missed). Pay 4 more bucks and get another product that offers a 1+ year warranty.",1,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
My son is obsessed!!!!! He loves these! And mommy love them too. They are very good quality. They have great sound and actually pretty good noise cancelling. They match his Amazon fire kids tablet! And he just looks so cute with them on!Update: we have had these for 7-8 months now and they are still perfect. They can handle a 2 year old little boy. Buy them.,5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,1
They are great for kids. I appreciate the fact that if my kids chew on the cord I don’t need to worry abt them getting bad chemicals like a lot of electrical equipment has. Wish you could buy the pink headphones individually like you can the blue. My youngest insists on pink. Other then that I have no complaints they do what there supposed to do.,5,1,2018-4-8,1,3,0
"I bought these for my daughter as she is starting school remotely due to the COVID. These are the perfect size, fold up nicely for storing, and very obviously noise cancel as I have to say her name a few times before she hears me. Ha! An added bonus is the ability to connect another set of headphones or earbuds. Very pleased with these so far!",5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"Depending on what you are listening to, these are not volume limiting! For example u tube videos (educational for distance learning) are VERY loud. You cannot just let your young children move from video to video without testing the volume on each. These DO go higher than the stated decimals. This is fraud and dangerous. DO NOT trust these w little ones ears!",1,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0
"I brought two of these for my 3 year old and 5 year old. They are adjustable so fits both of them. They love it and we love it because its nice and quiet now and I dont have to hear their tablets anymore, or them bickering because both of thier tablets are blaring at the highest volume. The sound is limited but loud enough for them. Works pretty well with the fire tablets. I highly recommend to other parents.",5,1,2019-9-5,1,0,0
"Very plasticky. The head band snapped on our first car trip.They are pretty and comfy, but not very durable. Good for supervised environments like your living room. Not a minivan full of kids. Not sure what I was thinking.",4,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
These headphones are great. The cord is short so you won't trip on it or get it too tangled. The volume is spot on. The one thing that I LOVE is that you can daisy chain these headphones together and hear the same thing without s splitter. I had no idea and it's perfect. My kids can watch a movie on the Ipad and plug in 1 headphone.,5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
"You will be very impressed by these headphones. Especially for only 20 bucks. Purchased August 10th 2020. They are not just for kids they fit my head fine too... I'm a small guy but there's still lots of room. Unless you have big ears. Anyway, the microphone is the best part since there's no stick or stem there's just a little hole inside the ear piece. And it picks up my voice very well  during phone calls. They are comfortable and the quality is impressive, even the cord has a thick soft lining around it.",5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
"The sound quality is fair.  I would recommend this for children 6-14.  The padding is very soft and comfortable.  The ability to connect another headphone to this is an added bonus for when kids need to share one tablet or other devices.In the photo, you can see the difference between the CHE1 (blue accent) and the CHE6 (green accent).  The CHE6 is an OVER-the-ear design while the CHE1 is an ON-ear design.",4,1,2020-6-30,1,0,1
"This is the 3rd set of headphones I got for my little son.  He wrecked the other 2 in less than 2 days, pulling the cord apart, getting it tangled.  These are still going strong, and he loves them. The curve is tight, so it stays on his ears real snug.  Also the cord is super strong.  He drags his leap pad around while still plugged in, but the cord doesn't get stretched out or broken.  Great for a rough little boy.",5,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"Ok so these are good but depends on your computer for the microphone. We’re having trouble syncing them with my kids’ brand new ASUS laptops but of course it works just fine on my husband’s 11 year old MacBook. So yes there is a microphone but it’s hard to sync it up. If that makes sense. I know a lot of reviews say no microphone but there is. Other than that frustration, these work as described.",3,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"Love these! Perfect for my nearly 3 year old for his birthday,  we tested the fit and sound quality and now he doesnt want to let them go,  fit snug and comfortable on his head. Don't come with any type of case like other brands do which is kindof a let down. Snap fold,  and my faveorit part! Cord is removable! So he can just run around playing with them without tripping o choking,  they do NOT do bluetooth she the cord is removed like some other brands but I'm find with all that for the price. Very satisfied.",5,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
"We bought two of these for our kids for a family vacation. The volume limit switch is awesome to ensure they don't go too loud in normal use but can still hear their show whole on a plane. The fit my kids (aged 3 & 5) great with plenty of room to grow. I can almost for in them, and I wear a size L/XL hat, so that's saying something about the size take. They don't match the sound quality of my Sennheiser headphones, but given their price I'm happy with them.",5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"Purchased for my son to use in school. I'm very impressed by the quality of the headphones. The padding is soft and comfortable and cancels out a lot of exterior noise.

Overall, the price is great and I will definitely purchase again if needed.",4,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"Noise control is great, but my five yr old figured out how to shut it off. It fits him just fine. I like that more headphones can piggyback from it, so I can listen in as he does his work if needed, or a sibling can watch a movie with him and both have headphones, or even more kids.

These have definitely stood up to the tests that others could not. Definitely worth the buy!!! I highly recommend.",5,1,2020-3-22,1,0,1
Purchased these for my son for back to school. They are both comfortable and durable. Love that they are volume limiting to protect his hearing while providing clear sound quality.

These are comfy, and even when I turned my phone up to full volume, they didn't overmodulate or become too loud, so these seem to be limiting the sound just fine without loss of quality. Only thing I wish all headphone manufacturers would do is make the ""R"" and ""L"" more prominent. I'll likely have to put a sticker on these so she knows which side is which.",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0

I needed headphones for my son who would be starting back to school 1 day in person and 4 days virtual this upcoming school year.  These headphones allow him to work in the same room as I do without disturbing me as I am working from home.  I am happy with the volume control on these as he will also be using these with his ipad/chromebook for non-school related work which include video watching and music listening on youtube.

They are nice headphones. Marketed for kids and the loudness setting is great! I love the option for kids to share what they are listening to & that’s what originally sold me. Just don’t loose or let the cord get ruined. The company does not offer replacement cords and good luck finding a double ended headphone jack that fits in them. I now have two pairs of useless headphones unless I buy another set due to not being able to replace the cord.,1,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"Edited to add: I still stand by my original review, but the company was gracious enough to send a replacement pair free of cost to make up for the first pair. I highly appreciate this level of customer service and so I have changed my star rating from 3 to 4!These were great for my kindergarten aged child until they weren't. Unfortunately about 9 months later only one side is producing sound. These are used maybe 2-3 times per week and still LOOK brand new, but unfortunately the quality doesn't seem to be there. Luckily they were not too expensive and are easy to replace, but it is still a disappointment.",4,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
They a great product for kids. My boys love them for sure. I like that you can hook up 2 headphones together. So if kids are sharing a tablet or phone both can hear so i thought that was neat. I just don't like the the safety volume control is right where the kids can see it. I feel it would have been better hidden on the ear muff or something like that. But great product no matter what,4,1,2020-9-12,1,0,1
"I bought this for my daughter to use with her Leap Frog Twist. Poor thing was holding it up to her head so she could hear it better and dancing around the house. So I found these, ler her choose her color and made the purchase. I honestly did not expect much from these, but they actually sound fantastic. We love that the fold up for storage, and they seem very durable. Buy with confidence.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,1
"These work quite well. The volume control on the side is basically just an on off switch that is supposed to keep them from pressing the volume buttons on their device, however, this feature did not work with my sons amazon fire tablet. Still overall, I am happy with the headphones.",5,1,2019-6-22,1,1,0
My son loves these headphones. He is 5 and uses them mostly for speech sessions during distance learning. I like how they can’t be turned too loud by accident and harm his hearing. He also likes how he can pause a video on the cord just by pressing a button. We use these headphones with a Fire HD 8 kids edition.,5,1,2020-9-5,1,0,1
"Our elementary school age kids love these headphones! They are comfortable enough to wear during their 5+ hour remote learning sessions and as an added bonus, the wires can connect with other Mpow headphones, enabling our kids to listen and share music and videos together. Extremely happy with our purchase!",5,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"Bought 2 of these for my kids for travel. I have to say that i really like sound quality, the fact that they partially cancel noise, connect to each oher and fold. The only issue i have with them is that volume limiting switch is right on the cord and easily accessible for kids to change. A toddler doesn't understand the purpose of the switch but loves buttons. I really wish the switch was hidden somehow.",5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones for my 7 year old who is doing virtual courses this semester. She likes the color (aqua/purple) and comfort. She's used them for a few weeks, but just for a short periods, but hasn't complained at all. I've tried them on as well and they fit me (although understandably a little snug). They seem to be very sturdy and well made.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
"About 1 week after buying the headphones a very small crack begin to show at the top of the headphones, the crack got bigger and bigger and then a little before 1 month passed, the headphones completely snapped; see the pictures. the headphones were not abused or misused in any fashion. Besides for the headphones breaking, they did work soundwise very well.",1,1,2020-2-3,1,0,1
"I ordered these for my son primally for at home virtual school use. They’re his favorite pair he’s owned so far. I’ve tried them on, you can definitely see a big difference with these with regard to noise canceling. The sound is pretty good. These are also very comfortable to wear. So far he really likes them.",4,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"This is our second pair of these headphones and our son and daughter both love these. Comfortable enough that they kept them on for 4-5 hour flights and durable enough to be thrown around. Noise cancellation is a nice feature, but you still need to ensure that the volume is low enough to not damage ears, depending on the audio input. Overall, strongly recommend!",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"I ordered six headphones in November 2018 for my kindergarten class. I only had two headphones left by the end of January that were still working. The others were either bent at the jack, or a student chewed on the wire a little (without exposing wires), and they stopped working. If your child(ren)/students treat their technology delicately, then these are probably a good product for you. However, in my opinion, they should not be sold for children. I need a durable (long-lasting) product for kids that won't break the bank for this teacher.  Anybody have any suggestions?",2,1,2019-5-7,1,0,0
"We bought two of these since we are now doing remote learning post Covid. The kids found this very comfortable and easy-to-use. Sound quality is great for basic listening needs.

"Love the color and softness of the headphones! Plan to take them for our daughter on the airplane so I will update once that trip takes place, but so far so good for our first pair of headphones.

Brought for my oldest after receiving these as a replacement so an older version I must say both of my kids love them so far these are the best kid friendly headphones they had they not to small and not to big and for the volume I love it even the lower setting they can still hear whatever they are listening to without it being super quite in the background,5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"So I bought two pair, one for both of my kids. The sharing function is the best thing ever! Really comes in handy. Love that it comes with volume control since my son tries to turn it up as much as possible. And definitely great noise cancellation, it's super hard to get my kids attention when they have them on. Great pair of headphones",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"While these fit my 7 year old and 4 year old well, the detachable cord is frustrating.  Often my headphones would be separated from the cord while in a bag/storage so it was a second piece I had to track down.  There is also no volume control on the cord and while the microphone is a nice addition, I can't say it is really useful.  The sound quality and comfort were better than other ""kid friendly"" headphones.",4,1,2019-4-23,1,0,0
"We loved this headset until the material around the cord started to separate. This made the inner cord bulge out of the hole, which created a permanent kink in the cord, as the material is so tightly wound we couldn't get the cord stuffed back inside. This began to happen in multiple spots, and now sound is only coming out of one of the earphones.",4,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"I purchased it for my preschooler.  He started using them in September in class, for about 30 minutes every day. During THanksgiving we used them when we traveled on the plane, and he started complaining he could only hear from one side. Fast forward 2 weeks and now they just don't work. Very disappointed. They look and feel very well made, so it was a surprise they did not last at all.",2,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"I got these for my daughters and they work really well. Sound is clear. They seem to be very well made for the price and at least from what I can tell, DURABLE! Perfect for smaller kids.

Volume reduction control does not work. It fails to reduce/stabilize the volume.The male jack does not properly fit consistently which makes the headset useless. This happens on three laptops.,2,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
These are kid friendly and I love that you can turn the volume control off and on.

The  earphone I recieved in a timely manner. The headphones were really good  quality the only thing was a small imperfection on the cord but i dont think it will effect quality.

"My daughter loves the color, design and fit. In particular, she points out that the oval shaped ear cushions are more comfortable than the round ones of the first headset we tried, which let her wear her mask without the any discomfort behind the ear.

We bought this headset for remote learning. We have a ton of kids so can’t afford a ton of headsets in one shot. This headset is a perfect compromise. The noise canceling is great. The size is perfect for kids head size. The color is gorgeous as well.I Would recommend.,5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"The ability to plug another pair of headphones into these headphones make the product priceless. Sharing an iPad in the airport, no problem, no dumb splitter to lose. OMG all kids headsets need these! Quality build, fits most kids heads under 10yo. With the kids studying from home during the pandemic these have daily long session use and are doing great.",5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
They are perfect for little and big kids. I really like that they can joint up with siblings head phones with out a slip jack. You can adjust volume limit between 85 and 94. I don’t like that less than 3 months they just quit working in the middle of a  show on a road trip.,4,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0

"I really liked these headphones for my daughter.  As kids tend to adjust these up and down physically, there is usually a small wire connecting the headphones to the headset piece that usually comes loose.

I know that sounds like contradicting statements, but noise canceling enough for us as parents.",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
I got this for my 5yo to use with his fire tablet and they work great. Good sound quality and they don't go up too high so it protects his ears. The cord is long enough which is great.

My 6 year old seems to like them. He usually doesn't wear any headgear but for short periods. I've tried them on and  I think they're pretty good for a kids headset.

"These headphones have good sound quality.  The two sound levels are nice to have.  They are comfortable and sit nicely around the ears.  I like how it conveniently folds in for storage.

Bought these for my 3yo nephew after the previous ones from Walmart broke. I like that these are more durable and keep me from having to listen to all his little videos he watches on YouTube all the time. He even picked out the color himself and loves them months later.

These are nice headphones with a thick plastic coated cord if you have a kid who likes to wind th cord these last longer than similarly priced headphones.

This is a solid pair of headphones with a wide range of features including a noise cancellation feature which is ok.  Also there is a decibel limiter which isnt the best because it makes the sound really low most of the time.  But overall it is a good headset,5,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0

Their teachers and classmates always know what they're saying. A great find!,5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
I bought two of these for our flight to NY. They worked great because both were able to use these headphones attached to each other to watch something on the same device. I like that it maxes out at a certain decibel so that it protects the kids ears. Sound quality is decent and it’s durable. We have thrown it around and squished it and is still working great.,5,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
I bought the for my son to use in 4K. He loves them! He was sad to have to leave them at school. He'll prob get a pair for Christmas. A neat feature is that you can plug pairs of these together. Perfect for our 2 kids 1 device situations.,5,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0

"Nice-looking headphones. Simple design and features except for the fact that the volume control on the strings isn't really volume control, it's just the limit of decibels that your child can raise the volume to. There is a mute button and it's adjustable and foldable. It covers the kid's ears completely (but not mine) and it does reduce the noise around it but it doesn't officially cancel it.",4,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0

My kid uses these as both headphones and earmuffs. He says it muffles the noises really good and can’t hear much when he’s actually listening to something.

"We bought this headphone to be used on an airplane by my kids,  they can't hear anything with the flight noise and they used our earphones on the flight.  My daughter would rather use our earphones holding them all the time, since they were too big for her than use these as she could not hear anything.  If you are buying it for use in a quiet environment then they are fine.  Anywhere there is noise outside like a restaurant or an airplane they are completely useless.Update:  the seller contacted me about the issue and provided a refund for the headphones. I am very impressed with their customer service.",3,1,2018-8-29,1,1,0
"We have bought three different sets of inexpensive children's off-brand headphones from Amazon plus LeapFrog headphones over the years. My kids say that this is the most comfortable ones they've had. And my kids tell me that it sounds better than all the other brands we've owned. I'm updating this review, as we've had these for 6 months and they are still holding up. We just ordered two more.Two of the competitor company ones stopped working in one ear within a week, and another worked for a month and then stopped working altogether. LeapFrog brand lasted the longest, we had two or three pairs of those and they all lasted forever. But they were the least comfortable and the cushion part that goes over the ear section would fall off all the time and it constantly have to spend time and getting it back on. So this particular brand has been by far the BEST, so says my 10 and 8 year olds. And the fact that I have about 4 pairs of kids headphones in the garage collecting dust.",5,0,2019-9-15,1,0,0
Update 7/1/2020 the customer service reached out to me to replace my son’s headphones as they were under the warranty time and they said it would seem they were defective. Great customer service.

I just ordered two more so his sister had a pair and he had a pair for his grandma’s house so the first pair I bought for school could stay here. I’m extremely disappointed.,4,0,2020-4-23,1,0,0

I bought two of these for my kiddos for distance learning.  They use them for all their google meets. I have three kiddos in online school at once so this allows them to focus and concentrate. The mic works well for them to record their work while drowning out most background noise.  I get some peace of mind that they are volume limiting.They like to link them together when they all want to listen to something fun such as a music lesson or watching a show.  My third kiddo has an old pair from another brand and he can just hook up as the last kid in the chain.  This way I can do my work without distraction if they all want to listen to something fun together.,5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
Amazing headphones for my kids. They currently use them while distance learning at home and they have been very helpful. They fit snug and are comfortable to wear plus the kids love that they can connect their headphones together!,5,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0

"I bought 2 of these headphones for my kindergartner and my 2nd grader to use for distance learning (and for car trips). Both have worked well. The headphones have good sound reproduction, fit well on their heads, and the microphones both pick up their voices during their virtual classroom instruction. In addition, they fold in on themselves for easier storage and transport. Highly recommend.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
Product was faulty from the get go. I had to wiggle the cord around to get sound through. Contacted seller to no avail. Will be returning the product.,1,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0

This pair of headphones is fit for young kids that have some limited use for speaking but enough for online classes these days. The sound quality is decent and you don't have to worry about the volume being too loud for children. It lightweight and the nicely colored too.,5,1,2020-7-11,0,0,1
