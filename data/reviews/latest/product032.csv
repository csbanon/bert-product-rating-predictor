"Please see my photos of the terrible quality of this paper.  Every sheet in the reem is damaged/folded/scores/marked/bent.  It isn’t shipping damage, it is just how it was packaged from the factory.While the paper is the correct width, you can see all these strange folds that completely jam the printer.  They are in the package like that!",1,1,2018-5-30,1,2,1
"I was looking for a less expensive, quality paper I could use at home.  I have a Lexmark printer and usually use a way more expensive paper product.  I decided to give the Amazon paper a try.  This is what I found:  It was well packaged and arrived in good condition.  The thickness seems standard, not too thin.  Didn't really notice a bluish or grey tint.  For some reason, this paper seems to be very sensitive to humidity (I live in DC, which is generally very humid until fall/winter).  If left out, the edges of the paper will curl very slightly and even develop a ripple-like texture throughout a page due to humidity.  Because of this, the sheets will occasionally jam.  I have found that if I place the paper in the printer shortly before printing, this is not a problem.  This is because I keep my paper supply in a box and usually only print with ""fresh"" paper in the printer.  I only had two minor paper jams before I realized this.  I would NOT recommend this paper for high-output copiers, but only for home copiers, where you have humidity control and fewer copies.  Other than that, I find it to be serviceable and a very good value.  Based on price alone, I would probably purchase this paper again.",4,1,2018-12-2,1,1,0
"I ordered this paper as a cheaper option for my older home printer (Epsom 3540) that I typically use for basic home functions such as printing shipping labels, recipes, and other small tasks.  I've been through one package and the paper works great.  I don't notice a tinted blue color as other reviewers mention.  It is thin, but it works flawlessly in my printer and sheets pull individually without getting stuck together.  If you're using this in a copy machine or for work purposes and require a certain weight/thickness or color, then maybe this isn't for you.  However, I never would have noticed a single issue if I hadn't read the reviews beforehand.  For the price, it was worth taking a chance.  I'm glad I did because the paper quality and price surpasses what I can buy locally.",5,1,2018-7-15,1,1,0
"In the 25 page report I just printed, there were 7 pages that didn't feed correctly and parts of those printed on 2 sheets or missed lines on the top or bottom, plus 7 extra pages fed with no printing on them.  I had to check every page to see which ones to reprint.  The printer's fine and I’d fanned the edges before I loaded it.  I've never had this problem with any other paper.Also the paper wrapping around each ream is very thin and arrived torn all over.  I had to handle them carefully to make sure they didn’t tear open completely and leave me with unwrapped reams.  ...not a big deal compared to the paper quality itself, but still annoying and they looked messy when they were stacked on the shelf.  Wish I’d taken a photo before I packed them up to return.",1,1,2020-3-8,1,8,0
"This is the second time I've purchased AmazonBasics copy paper for my home inkjet printer.  I had been purchasing from Staples, but find I am liking buying this item from Amazon far better.  The paper is very good quality and feeds well through the printer - - and most of my printing is two sided!  I am actually experiencing fewer paper jams than with other brands.  A big plus for me is that with Amazon, I can get a really good price without buying a HUGH quantity.  Now, I just buy three reams at a time and it's shipped straight to my door.  I've also used it with some art projects involving photo transfer and have been please with the results.",5,1,2018-7-9,1,1,0
"It was frustrating to see that the paper was damaged upon opening the shipping box.  The outside shipping box was in perfect condition.  However, because the shipping box was bigger than the box of 8 reams of paper - it shifted in the shipping process causing 3 reams to break open.  2 of the reams are damaged beyond use.  Very frustrating that something as simple as packing this properly has now caused wasted work-time.",1,1,2020-3-23,1,9,1
"I ordered Amazon Basics paper before, it was made in France. It was great paper with smooth finish. Loved it so I ordered more recently. When I received the order, I noticed that the paper was made in USA. The smooth finish was gone with the name of ""France"". Now, the AmazonBasics paper just a regular paper, no different with other brands. I may order more in the further, but I won't be excited when I receive it.",3,1,2019-3-22,1,8,0
"I last had a printer about 10 years ago, until just recently, when I succumbed to the need and bought myself an HP Inkjet. I don't really print much, but when I need to, it's a real pain. I didn't want to spend a lot on paper, and luckily I found this. As usual, Amazon Basic brand turns out to be excellent. The paper is great quality, thick, very white, and prints very well on an HP Inkjet. This pack has three reams of 500 pages each, for $5/ream, which is an excellent price for paper of this quality. It's going to take me about 4 years to go through this much paper, but when I finally finish it off, I'll happily buy another case. Good purchase.",5,1,2018-5-1,1,1,0
"I bought a case of this paper on October 5, 2018.  It seems like very nice paper and of good quality.  But it does not play nice with my fairly new HP Officejet Pro 8610 printer.  My printer is sometimes grabbing 2 sheets instead of 1.  So I end up with 1 sheet with maybe the top 1"" printed and then the rest of the print is on the second page.  I've uninstalled my printer and reinstalled it plus ensured I had the latest software.  I've also aligned and adjusted it several times.  I also cleaned all the paper pickup rollers with rubbing alcohol, all to no avail.  I had to print an 80 page document yesterday and ruined 35 pages in the process.  My last case of paper lasted me about a year but the way it's going I'll probably go through this case in half the time.  I've also tried fanning the paper out because sometimes static electricity will bind pages together as well as not fanning out the paper with no success either way.Bottom line is I will be buying a different paper the next time.  Again, it's nice paper but it may not necessarily work correctly with your printer.",3,1,2019-3-8,1,8,0
It can be a little tough to write a review that opposes so many other reviews. It sets us up for criticism. That said - there is no way we can recommend this paper.PROS - The container size (half carton/5 reams) is great. Love it. So much easier to carry and store. The price of $16 or $17 is good. It was shipped quickly and in good condition. These pros also apply for Georgia-Pacific Spectrum Standard 92 Multipurpose Paper and other competitors.,1,1,2018-3-21,1,5,0
UPDATE: I still had two reams of this from an order and decided I should use it up before breaking up my new case of other paper. The document I was printing had 103 pages. My printer jammed 21 times using this paper while trying to print that document. Downgrading to one star. I ended up just throwing the rest of my Amazon paper stock into the recycling bin. Not worth the frustration.ORIGINAL REVIEW:,1,1,2020-1-8,1,6,0
"ITS PRINTER PAPER! Has not spontaneously combusted or exploded. Does not smell bad. Lays flat when left alone. Ink seems to stick well to surface. Cuts with scissors. Will catch fire if a match is held to it, so that’s worth noting. Would not recommend for boat building or making farming implements but it’s a fine printer paper.",5,1,2017-12-31,1,2,0
"If you work in an office and know your paper, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS PAPER!  I decided to try it out and it is super slick so not all of our printers are able to pull it efficiently.  The bigger problem I have, is that for some reason it curls when it gets heated, like when it goes through a laser printer.  It might work OK with an ink jet printer where no heat is used, but if you're using a laser printer, I'd advise against buying this paper. I honestly don't know what causes that, but its a problem.  Another thing to note is that if you don't like plastic, the ream wrappers seem to be plastic coasted paper, so it can't go into a paper recycling bin.  It's worth it to pay more for a better quality paper.",2,1,2017-9-29,1,1,0
"After reading reviews indicating that the paper was thin and poor quality, I was hesitant to purchase this product but decided to do so because it was the lowest price ream of paper offered.  I am glad to say that I had no reason to be concerned.  The paper is good quality.  It is not thick but it is not very thin either.  The sheets of paper are consistent in size and perfect for every day use which is what I needed.  I find that all AmazonBasics products that I have purchased have been of high quality at a great point.  This one is no different.  I will be purxhasing again.",5,1,2017-6-13,1,9,0
"Just got the paper and this is how it arrived. The paper is all a part of the back to school supplied, and what the classrooms require us to bring. Not sure how I'm supposed to hand this over like this. Very surprising. Not only are they both open, but the top of one of them looks torn. Quite surprising because it is an Amazon product. Disappointing.",1,1,2018-8-7,1,5,1
WILL NOT FEEDThe paper will not feed in my Canon inkjet printer. I've tried fanning the paper before loading and loading such that the pages are staggered or aligned. It just fails to feed every 10th page or so. It is extremely annoying to go push the reset button every other print. Printer works great for other papers.,1,1,2017-11-2,1,5,0
The paper is exactly what I expected. It's comparable to other 20lb/92 bright paper I've bought at the office supply store. I do like that I can buy this in smaller packs.,5,1,2017-11-21,1,4,0
"The product was great, it arrived on time and I didn't notice a difference in quality from a slightly more expensive paper. The reason I removed a star was because the paper casing on the reams of paper themselves weren't glued well. As soon as you pick it out of the box the paper casing on the ream immediately will fall apart. It was quite frustrating when 500 sheets of paper went on the floor unexpectedly because of the glue around the ream coming loose. Just be careful removing each ream and you will be fine.For those who want to know where this was manufactured (the paper) it is from France. Like i said though it is just as good as any other regular paper you get but a lot cheaper.",4,1,2017-11-9,1,3,0
"I have to give this paper a one star rating.  I have to spend so much time going through my printed (or copied) pages, to pull out the many blank pages that go through while copying or printing.  I have never had this problem with other brands of paper.  This paper is thin, slick, curls when used in a copier, and if I print out a 15 page document, for instance, or copy multiple page documents, there will be at least 3-5 blank pages stuck throughout each document.  I have to go through everything page by page to take out the extra paper.  Then if I try to put it back in the printer to use that blank paper, it jams.  Too slick, too thin, and the cheaper price isn't worth the hassle of dealing with this paper.  I do know to and always fan out a stack of paper in both directions to make sure it will go through the printer or copier one sheet at a time, but nothing works to keep this paper feedng one sheet at a time.  I ordered a case of 8 reams; I have gone through three reams, trying to make it work, but the other five reams will be donated, I think, to a kindergarten for kids to drawn on.  It's definitely not something I would recommend anyone buying to use as office printing or coping paper.",1,1,2019-7-30,1,1,0
"the product is a good price for the amount of paper you get, but dont expect quick delivery.  I order this on 8/2/18.  the delivery was 8/13/18.  this was the 1st bad sign on a Prime product. On 8/13/18, the delivery was changed to 8/17/17.  On 8/17/18, the delivery was changed to 8/18/18.  On the morning 8/18/18, is showed ""Package out to deliver"".  Expect by 8p.  at 9p an email received  that delivery is not 8/19-22/18.  no way to trace my package anymore.  It finally got delivered on 8/19.  plan way ahead.The paper has a subtle blue tint.  the thickness of the paper is thinner than the standard 20# paper I normally get and it has a polished feel, like paper used in a fax machine.  I am now concerned based on other reviews that the paper will not feed well in my printer.  one way to find out.  I hope the finish will not coat the feeder rollers on my printers, it will be very difficult to clean those.",1,1,2018-8-20,1,1,0
I have gone through reams of paper since school started and I needed a less expensive source. I'm hoping this is it. The paper is really nice. Allows me to print what I need. Same brightness and print quality...and it's made in the USA!,5,1,2019-9-15,1,1,0
"Perfectly good office paper for 99% of routine office jobs. In the event you need specialized paper for brightness or thickness, just buy a small amount of that variety--this product is not meant for you. But still buy it for you office. Seriously. You won't need paper for the next 10 years and the price is unbeatable. The only possible drawback is storage space. The box is roughly 20x12x9. Keep that in mind.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"I've never bought paper in this quantity before so i was a little shocked when i first saw the package... man was it heavy.The paper itself is thin, but i haven't had any bleeding or excessive feathering so far. I saw some other reviews saying the paper curls from the heat of printing, but I haven't experienced that myself. Still chugging along with the first pack!!!",5,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0
"I just received my replacement ream because the other package was torn open and pages were missing potentially... I have no idea as it was completely ripped open. With 500 pages I was not counting. I asked to return and they said to keep it and they would replace, which is generous (and why I gave 4 stars, not 3), but the new ream was ripped as well. I am not sure if people are running out of paper at the warehouse and grabbing a few pages to print with or if the outside protector wrap is just too thin. The paper is as described. Just hope next time I order, the ream is in tack.",4,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"We ordered this exact product a year and a half ago, and it was surprisingly great quality.  Sturdy, bright white, smooth to the touch like premium printer paper.  We reordered the same product recently and the product has degraded in quality while being sold under the same Amazon Basics label.  It's unusually thin, flimsy, slightly rough to the touch (like notebook paper) and just cheap.  I had a couple sheets of the old paper to compare by feel and I noticed the differences.  Not a good business practice for Amazon to lower the quality of a product once good reviews have cemented its sales.",2,1,2019-10-4,1,1,0
"I would say that this paper is a little thicker than i thought it was going to be.  The paper also feels a little bit less flexible than im used to.  I like to draw and write on these with pencil, so this type of paper didn't work as well with pencils/pens as i've had in the past.  However, if you're just using it for printing, then it's great.",3,1,2018-7-27,1,1,0
"i take my training, nutrition, and health pretty seriously.  i am mindful of what i put into my body and it needs to be clean, healthy, and yummy!  this product hits all those important bullets for me.  i appreciate how easy it is to blend this into a shake - even without a shaker bottle!  i prefer the chocolate to the vanilla, but i think that is a personal preference.  i would recommend this protein powder to anyone that is trying to set positive intentions for being healthy.  in a journey that is not always easy this is a life saver.  thumbs up.  way up!",5,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0
"I am very pleased with this paper quality.  It never got stucked (overlapped)  or slipped from rolling the paper out when printing, like other reviews.  I am lucky.  I have a regular office, no high tech equipment with glossy finishes.  You can use this paper quality for regular print-outs.  Even printing coupon is great.  It all depends on your printer.  If you are looking for shiny thick paper quality, then, no this is not for you.  But if you need basic requirements, then this is for you and me.  I am pleased with the paper product.  Will order again..if the price is cheap.",4,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
I've seen many negative reviews about this paper. People have said it jams in the printer and is too thin and chalky. I'm glas I didn't listen to this. I have the most basic printer ever and the paper goes right through it without any issues. I've been using it all semester and haven't had a jam once. It is a little thin but its not like its tracing paper thin and it doesnt rip by accident. As for chalkiness...I didn't notice any. I will be buying again when I need to. It's a great price and will last a while.,5,1,2018-10-15,1,0,0
This paper checks all the boxes. It's a nice bright white it feels substantial more than others I've bought on here and it works very well through my printer my printer on some of the cheap stuff my printer picks up two sheets at a time and with this I have not had that issue so far so far I would highly recommend this paper to anyone and feel good about that recommendation.,5,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
This is certainly a great price for a big ream of basic paper.  This will last me a long time and works well in my Canon printer/copier/scanner/fax machine.,5,1,2017-5-10,1,6,0
This paper is horrible!  I have a home office and utilize multiple laser printers and this paper gets jammed in every single printer.  I am not sure if it is because of the thinness of the paper or the unusual texture.  I will not buy it again.  This box is heading to the recycle bin.,1,1,2019-7-16,1,2,0
"After using 2 reams now does not work on my Epson XP-310. With a chute of 25 pages and it says paper out! Called Epson Tech Services who walked me through all the set up functions and it said the same! They told me something was wrong internally and offered for me to send it to their authorizes service center at my cost! Something didn't feel right so I purchased a pack of HP paper, loaded it and it started printing like it had been doing before the Amazon paper!I must add, here in Central Texas, the weather has been very strange, fog, mist, drizzles and high humidity which may be the reason, so, I would not recommend its use except in dry weather, but even then it might be a waste of money!",1,1,2017-9-25,1,1,0

"This is not the link I opened. I remembered clearly that the order I made was for 8 reams paper and $25.59. I even bragged it to my husband that I got a really good deal on it. How could it turned out to be an 5 ream shipping? You can tell me that I didn't pay attention when placed my order, but the link I opened said 8 reams. So disappointed......",1,1,2020-2-9,1,1,0
"It's white and it's paper but I wouldn't buy it again; I pity whoever I decide to give the rest of it to. Meh. The paper is on the thin side so ink shows through making duplex printing a really bad idea unless you want to have a new ""solve this report"" word game during your next meeting. Grr. Coloring on it with markers is a bad idea since the paper is on the slippery side so the marker smears and also bleeds through the paper. How am I supposed to draw a Picasso during the next 4 hour financial department snooze fest meeting? Argh. Schlepping myself out into the world to get a case of my normal brand, thicker, non-slickery paper. Guess I'll have to interact with real humans. Gasp!",2,1,2018-6-5,1,0,0
"I purchased 3 reams of this paper and I am using it on my trusty HP laser printer, which I have used for years with multipurpose papers purchased from Staples and Target with NO jams/problems.  Using the AmazonBasics 92 Bright Multipurpose Copy Paper in the paper tray ALWAYS jams my printer on pages 2-3 on a multi-page print.  Referring to the Q&A section and product reviews, some customers suggested fanning the stack of paper.  I tried that, and the paper still jammed in the printer.The only way I can avoid paper jams with this AmazonBasics paper on a multi-page print job is to feed the paper manually one-by-one into the laser printer - totally NOT convenient.  Technically the print quality of the paper for single-sided prints is fine, but either the thinness or the slickness of the paper is causing the paper to jam in my laser printer.",2,1,2019-1-21,1,0,0
"When the paper runs through and doesn't jam, the print quality is good. Problem is it frequently jams up the printer and I have to open the back cover, take out the toner cartridge, manually pull out the jammed paper. What a huge pain in the rear. Other paper stock I've purchased from the usual big box office stores- I do not have this problem. Paper is good for the grandkids to draw on but not dependable for the printer.

"Would not order AmazonBasics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper again. Keeps jamming !  None of the other paper, including the Rely Brand, order at the same time keeps causing paper jams like the AmazonBasics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper.

"This paper is fine. Some of the pages at the edge were a little rippled but didn't affect printing in my laser printer. The reams were sealed in moist proof paper. Good for making copies of receipts when you need payment confirmation or whatever. Good to draw on as well.

"I'm not sure I can convey how life-changing this copy paper is. Don't let the ""AmazonBasics"" fool you, because this paper is NOT ""basic."" It is transformative. It is paper-thin. It is rectangular. It is so white, it is practically the Oscars. It is manufactured to the highest standards: the short side is 8.5 inches -- no more, no less -- while the long side is a precise 11 inches. In the past, I have used paper from Xerox, or Staples, or Office Depot. Never again!

"Got the paper, needed it in a hurry, and wasn't able to go out, so amazon was my last resort.  Had to throw the paper out.

It is almost impossible to use for two-sided printing.Original review: I have purchased this product several times and have noticed what appears to be a decline in its quality. I have measured a jam rate as high as almost 6% in the most recent ream that I used (28 sheets per 500) and the typical jam rate is between 1% and 2%.

"This is ultimately my own fault, I know.  But I also think this represents some slimy marketing practices on Amazon's part.  When you go to the copy paper section, you have the option to filter by size.  And when I chose 8.5x14 - legal sized paper... this is the top option that came up.  And the Amazon letter-size paper is featured more than once on the first page of results.  I was in a hurry and made the mistake of trusting that Amazon's filters would work as designed on their own product, so now I've wasted money on the wrong size paper.

I personally have a Brother MFC-J995DW Inkvestment printer and have had absolutely no issues whatsoever with this paper.  My wife prints a lot for her job as a pre-school teacher and also for her scrapbooking hobby and this works perfectly for her.  She has also said that it laminates well with her AmazonBasics laminater and cuts well on her Cricut® Explore Air 2.  So really we have no complaints at all.",5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"When I saw Amazon selling 3 case ream  (1,500 sheets!!) of this at $9.82 I didn't even think twice and hit the purchase now button. Item was unavailable at the said time, so I'm guessing that might account for the price drop. But who's complaining, right? There was no way I was going to pass on this especially since we use this a lot in the house.Personally, I do not believe you can get a better price anywhere, especially if you consider that this is the average going brand price for a single ream of 500 sheets.. The paper quality is at par with brand names so I have next to no complaints in that area.",5,1,2018-4-7,1,0,0

I go through a lot of printer paper on a weekly basis. Most of this is for documents that are saved as in office files or for rough drafts of documents. Going to the store for individual boxes of paper has been a pet peeve for awhile.This paper came right to my door with free shipping with prime. The paper itself is packaged well and none of the individual packages were damaged. The paper loads and prints well. The paper seems a little thin but this is actually a benefit for the type of work that I do. I would think twice about using this for finished projects for clients but this is an all around great all purpose office paper.,4,1,2017-8-8,1,1,0
"I was very disappointed with this purchase. Normally I buy name brand printer paper, but I figured that Amazon Basics paper would likely be similar to other brands, it’s just paper after all. I bought two cases of it, now I just have two cases of scratch paper because this stuff jams up my laser printer almost every other page I print. I have never had a jam before I bought this paper. I would highly recommend people stay away from this product. Now that I bought new paper by HP I haven’t had a single jam.",1,1,2020-2-8,1,1,0
"I bought this paper for use in my HP LaserJet and it works great. The paper is heavy (compared to the cheap crapole most office use) and print quality was good. I'm knocking one star off my rating as this paper says it is 92 brightness but to me looks a bit like really nice newspaper. Don't get me wrong it doesn't look bad or yellow, it just looks dingier than I expected, I like my paper to be a bright crisp white.I would definitely buy this paper again provide I can't find something with a higher white level at the same price.",4,1,2019-7-10,1,1,0
"I purchased this just recently based on a satisfied purchase in October 2018. But the paper has changed.Pros: It's still a 92 brightness. It prints very nicely no jamming nor multi page feeds. The (10/18) paper seemed to have static electricity, and would stick to itself making it difficult to straighten a printed stack. This doesn't have that static. The paper does seem to accept the toner well, so prints look crisp and brilliant.",4,1,2019-4-29,1,1,0
"Bought this for office use in faxes and a laser printer. The finish on this paper is a little odd in that it has a very slight blue cast to it (which for us is no big deal) and it is very smooth. The smooth part is a problem for our laser printer as it has a hard time feeding it through the machine so we are having to un-jam the machine a lot. This didn't happen with other paper we have that has a little rougher texture. We don't have that problem with our fax machines. The price is very good for the paper and we put more paper through the faxes then the printer, so we may just end up getting a few reams if the previous paper for the laser printer. Ya I know that is a little weird.",3,1,2019-4-10,1,0,0

"We have a home based business and use a lot of paper, so I thought I'd try to save us some money and purchase the Amazon Basics Multipurpose Copy Paper.  I should have listened to my gut because going cheaper doesn't always equal same quality.  The paper prints nicely but that's about it.  When I file papers, this copy paper folds and bends very easily instead of laying flat like I'd hope it would.  We scan all of our paperwork to avoid having piles of papers in our office on a daily basis.  While the image of the scanned paper turns out nice, to get there means having to unjam my printer on just about every scan.  The paper gets stuck and often tears mid-scan.  As a result, I will be returning to our local office supply store and purchasing their brand of copy paper which has always worked nice.  It is worth spendng a few extra dollars so we don't have the headache of the thin Amazon paper.",3,1,2018-8-15,1,2,0

Seems to feed okay up top, but the paper keeps clipping the insertion feed from the main tray (even after all the cleaning/fanning steps).  Switched to 24 lb paper of  another brand, and the jams totally went away.  Paper seems fine to the touch, and I'm no paper guru, so I can't say what's not optimal about it.

"This paper is effective for our office use. It meets our minimum weight for our laser jet printer and holds up well when there are several hundred prints rolling off the line. I have no issues with colors popping on this paper, and no issues with bleeding or smearing. Again, I do have a laser machine so that may have an impact on our prints. The paper is just as good, if not better, than a brand priced three times as much. The weight is good and it POPS if you make a standard paper pop toy and test it out. Some find that a good test of paper and durability. It's a true white paper and no issues with this. I will definitely purchase more reams.",5,1,2018-3-7,1,1,0
"The paper is too thin, curls when heated and subsequently can not be scanned anymore. It may work for throw away stuff, but is not professional or useable for documents. It is also too rough to use as toilet paper. In addition, the packaging is awful and the reams will arrive damaged which happened in the two times I ordered it. While convenient to get it delivered, the quality is really unacceptable. And yes the packaging can not be recycled. What a waist of money and time.",1,1,2018-2-13,1,1,0
"Paper is thinner than we realized. It works with our Laserjet printer, but we may not get this brand of paper next time.

This paper comes out with 2-8 sheets at a time and sometimes a page will print over 2 pages.  I fan it, reassort it and put it back in but doesn't seem to help.  It may be less expensive but the amount of time I  have to waste managing it is not worth the cost savings.  Of course you cannot determine this until you have used it for a while - that it is the paper and not the printer.  Too bad for me.  There will be a new reason it cannot be returned.",1,1,2020-4-23,1,3,0

"I order this paper for our small office (less than 20 employees) and we have it set for subscription. We’re nearly entirely paperless but do need to make copies of certain documents and such, and this paper is perfect for just that! It’s not thick and it’s not the brightest - but if you’re not needing fancy schmancy paper for presentation, then this will do just fine for you! Early on, we did have a couple reams that arrived damaged on one single delivery and Amazon was quick to correct the issue...so don’t let that or all of the other reviews that claim this deter you; this is great paper for the price and the best part is that you don’t have to go to the store and lug it back to your office!",5,1,2020-4-9,1,2,0

"Maybe I am just easy to please, or maybe I got lucky, but this paper is great. For what we paid vs what we got I am very happy. I kind of like the ""downside"" of the top rated bad comment.. which is that this paper is thin. I hate double sided prints and with how much storing of files we do I can appreciate this lighter weight stuff. Small businesses, home, college.. this is the perfect paper. If you're churning out collated binders and stuff I'd definitely go with a heavyweight. I am Very pleased with it. Kinda neat having Amazon branded reems laying around either.Only issue I had was the free shipping. I don't have prime which is probably my own dumb fault. But! The next option after free was 20 dollars which was rediculous cause at that point I'm paying more then the name brand shipped. The free shipping was bad.. Took a week and a half. I was stealing teems from 10 year old printers upstairs while I waited and barely made it.

"Every single paper order I've placed and received through Amazon has had very disappointing delivery quality where there is consistent damage to the paper's packaging. To be fair, none of the deliveries have damaged the paper itself - just the packaging, which is only frustrating for transport/storage purposes.I've discovered that the packaging damage is less severe when ordering individual reams as opposed to any case, but this gets pricey when you have to order several individual reams.",3,1,2019-5-1,1,0,0
"I homeschool, and my daughter is crafty, which means we go through a LOT of paper. I use this in my laser printer for work and for homeschooling. Buying in bulk like this (we bought eight reams) saves us money and it makes sure we have enough for the next six months or so.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
Awesome that Amazon has its own Basic necessity products.  The quality of the paper is great and I not thin at all for the price. It stand up to other brands that are sold at stores for the same or higher price in the same paper weight range.

This paper is thin and kind of slippery, for lack of a better word. I use a Brother Laserjet printer, and the pages come out curled around the edges. If I'm printing a large quantity at once, I have to stop in between and pull smaller stacks off the tray or the curled pages will push pages out of or off, the stack onto the floor, causing a mess.

I was very low on printer paper and wasn't sure when I'd be getting to a store for more. I was going to order a different brand but for what I'm using it for (mainly coupons) I figured I'd try Amazon's brand since it was a few dollar cheaper for the same amount of paper. I'm glad I did. It's perfect for what I'm using it for. Would definitely order it again if I need it. It's great to have the option when I can't get to a store.,5,1,2017-7-9,1,1,0

I don't really know what the cause of that was.I will continue to get copy paper from Amazon since I had bad dealing with the local Staples with their crazy (waste my time) reward system.

"Not sure what happened here or why someone felt the need to do a RIVERDANCE on this package.  When did Michael Flatley start packaging/delivering for amazon? Good to see he's still at the top of his game.  One, the ""box"" holding the reams was completely missing a side.  Two, each ream inside this quasi box was opened and by opened I mean torn.  Three, one ream was completely missing packaging, paper just shoved in where there was space.  Four, some of the paper looked as though it had been stepped on i.e. Riverdance.  Five, not sure why a bigger box was not used or and I know I'm asking for a lot here but at least a box containing all sides.  Six, two reams were beyond damaged they had to be discarded.

"I still haven't used the paper, but it looks fine. However, the packaging/wrapping on each ream of paper was open on both ends and in the back when it was received.  One ream had slid around and been twisted in transit so that the paper is rendered useless for a laser printer; it will jam immediately. If it hadn't come unsealed, it probably would not have moved like that during shipping. It seems pretty ""Basic"" that printer paper needs to remain flat and be protected until use, but that is not the case here.",2,1,2017-3-19,1,0,0

"AmazonBasics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper is a paper used for typical office work and work at home.  The paper is bright white, and it is not glossy.  Back in the day, I encountered paper that was off-white, and where this resembled the paper used for printing newspapers.  But AmazonBasics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper does not in any way have a ""cheap"" feel to it.  I've tested this AmazonBasics paper using my HP LaserJet Pro M402n printer, which I bought from Amazon.com.  This paper does not get stuck in the printer, and it does not wrinkle or bunch up in the printer.  Although I've used this paper for only two months, I have not yet encountered a situation where I needed to open up the printer and pry out and remove stuck pieces of paper.  The documents that I've printed on this AmazonBasics paper include: ( 1 )  Copies of my ""Artist's Statement,"" which I plan to distribute tomorrow during an exhibition of my landscape photographs; ( 2 )  Journal articles in immunology; ( 3 )  Patents and patent applications.  When I click on the ""PRINT"" button, my documents are reliably printed without any smudge marks.  Also, the gray tones are reproduced accurately on this AmazonBasics paper, in the situation where the document includes black and white images or color images.",5,0,2019-8-1,1,2,0
"If you are going to use this paper to “print / copy” on with any expectation of print quality beware of requirements. This recycle media would be well-suited for taking handwritten notes or children drawing with crayons. Would not recommend using theirs in a printer that cost more than $50. If so make sure to correct the settings in the control panel so the printer knows it is printing on recycled media. For instants, every printer has a recommended paper media. Sometimes several. In order to print on this you have to reduce the amount of ink shot onto the page. Or toner. Otherwise it will bleed through and quality will look very poor. Also allow a very long amount of drying time (10 min or longer) Unless you are in an extremely dry environment.",3,0,2020-6-27,1,2,0
"We have been buying Georgia Pacific or Hewlett-Packard brand 20 pound white printer paper from Amazon Prime. Those cost about $5/ream when you buy the 3 or 5 pack. This AmazonBasics paper is $4/ream. While it is also 20 pound paper, the finish is not as smooth and even as the GP or HP papers. You get what you pay for. For personal use, the cheaper paper is fine with us. Interestingly, the AmazonBasics paper is made in France, while the other 2 are made in the USA (if you care). AmazonBasics 10-pack comes in a big heavy box that does get beat up in shipping, but the paper inside seems to be OK.",3,0,2017-3-5,1,1,1
"Like all Amazon Basics... its a mid tier, high volume product that offers tremendous value.  I am very impressed how amazon cherry picked so many products and began offering them under the amazon Brand... why?  I know if I buy it, I will prob. be happy with it, and if not, NO company has ever stood behind their products more than Amazon....hence why many of us have made Amazon the GIANT they have become... the earned it.This paper is a great all around paper and a good price point... there are heavier papers for special presentations, and there is junk paper for scrap printing....but at this price point, I will print with this paper 95% of the time.... Kudos to Amazon purchasing staff who is filling out the Amazon Basic lineup....",5,0,2017-3-4,1,0,0
"I have read some reviews that mentioned some issues with paper getting stuck, folding or getting jammed in printer. I have not experienced any of this issues with my Dell laser printer. There is no rolling of the paper from the heat after printing or any jams. This paper seems not as see through or thin as the staples paper I was currently using. I think this is an upgrade from my existing brand and a nice price to compliment it. Give it a try yourself!",5,0,2019-4-20,1,0,1
"I've had my own office for 20 years and have tried lots of brands of copier paper over the years.  I admit to being skeptical when I purchased this, thinking it would be akin to being a generic paper.  But so far I'm very impressed, no jams, print quality is great, and the paper looks bright and high quality compared to brands I've used in recent years (even those ""rated"" the same as this one).",5,0,2019-1-31,1,0,0
It's your basic printer paper - lots of it. This case with eight reams will probably last me three years. I use it in a Brother black&white laser printer and have no issues whatsoever with the quality of the sheets. If you want a good value on a lot of office printer paper for your home office/small office this is a good choice.,5,0,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"I work in a print shop so I took this paper to work to see how it compared to the regular brand of 20# copy paper we usually use. We couldn't tell any difference. There are other weights of copy paper that it would not compare well with, but when you compare apples to apples it seems to be essentially the same. 20# multipurpose is our basic go-to paper for black-and-white copies. (We usually use a heavier paper for color copies.)",5,0,2019-5-22,1,0,0
"It's good paper. I've used it with my Tombows, which can be really hit or miss with printer paper, and I've had no issues. Otherwise, it feeds well, it doesn't jam. It doesn't smear. It doesn't give me any trouble. It's just a whole lot of good paper at a great price. For most uses, this is a great value. Back in the day, I might have turned my thesis in printed on this with no concern at all.",5,0,2019-8-14,1,0,0
"I normally buy Canon printer paper but it has gotten SO expensive !!! So, when I was offered this box of Amazon Basics Copy paper, I immediately grabbed it.  It doesn't seem quite as bright as Canon paper but it prints beautifully and the cost makes it a Winner ! Don't hesitate about buying the Amazon Basics brand....it is really like the name brand companies for a fraction of the cost",5,0,2019-5-10,1,0,0
"This AmazonBasics multipurpose copy paper works great both in laser and inkjet printers. It has a nice white with a 92 brightness which to me is the most balanced white. It isn't too contrasty nor flat. It works well for text, black and white graphics and color printouts. The paper is dust free and runs thru the printer just fine. No paper jams. It's a great value too. 5 stars.",5,0,2019-5-28,1,0,0
"Terrible quality.  I go through 200 sheets of paper a day and I can tell you, this paper is bottom of the barrel.  It will fold up in a U shape on the top of my LaserJet printer and trick into into thinking the bin is ""full"" when only a few sheets have been printed out.  Not recommended for business or anyone who uses a lot of paper.  Might be ok if you use a few sheets a week or something.",1,0,2018-7-31,1,0,0
"I'm a writer and mainly use paper for the printer to print off drafts, coupons, etc. In other words, I don't need the best paper and/or the most expensive.This works quite well for me. I've had no problem with jams, curling, etc. I also like having a large supply on hand, so I don't have to worry about running low. This box should last me years, and that makes me happy.",5,0,2019-4-27,1,0,0

"What can I say, it's paper. It's rated at 92 brightness and is true to color as far as I'm concerned. Unfortunately, there are some big problems with this paper.So what's the issue with this product? Well, for starters, it's a lot thinner than other brands. I typically use Hammermill or HP paper (occasionally Target) and those brands are nice and thick. The reams sold here on Amazon don't carry the same heft and just feel cheap. The second I opened up the first ream I could tell it was lackluster paper. For reference, it's like if you bought 3-ply toilet paper and got 1-ply instead.",3,0,2019-4-28,1,0,0
"I've worked in a lot of offices and engineering groups, and at home have about six printers, 3 lasers, and 4 inkjets.  I've used many types of copy print paper, and this is not as good as most.  It tends to slip in the machine, one from my color laser, and all three of my cheaper inkjet printers.  When it did print it was OK fair to good, the paper is bright and somewhat slick. I had tried to write on it with a ball and it skipped.  I have this trouble occasionally with slick papers, but most copy paper has the texture to write well.  Is this really 20# paper, I though it looked a bit lighter than my other 20# paper, but maybe it's the density.  It did perform pretty well in the photocopy mode for the color laser, but I had thought this was an all purpose type, so while it's good for photo colors, it is not as good as the special paper made for that.  I use a better quality for photo printing to recapture some old family portraits and such.  This is good, but the expensive stuff for that is better.  The price is decent, but for a few dollars more you can do better, not recommended.",2,0,2019-4-20,1,0,0
"This is okay basic copy paper. It consistently feeds through my color laser printer one sheet at a time without jamming. It is less bright and more transparent than my hammermill paper of the same weight, but it is also significantly cheaper. It is not ideal for double sided use because you see shadows from the other side through the paper. Color is not accurate, but not terrible. It takes laser ink well and text is crisp. It doesn't cause patchy ink spots and adhesion is good. It works for school work, one sided documents, and coloring pages for the kids. For professional applications i would spend a bit more to get better quality, but for day to day use when you are not trying to impress someone it's fine. The case of 8 reams arrived in good shape, 8 individually wrapped reams in a large bankers box type box.",4,0,2019-4-21,1,0,0
"I like the way this paper is packaged- the box is more manageable in size than the normal size box of copier paper. It will probably take us a year or more to go through all of it at home. I ordered it for home use and we just don't print much stuff at home anymore.It works okay in our printers. One printer is an HP Deskjet and the other is a Canon Inkwell. I did try some in the higher speed copier at work, and it did jam up there but at the slower speeds of the home office printers it worked just fine.",4,0,2019-4-19,1,0,0
"I found some of the other (negative) reviews interesting because they were for high volume situations and different printers, which apparently caused some compatibility/performance issues. I had never thought of the finish of a paper or how it might react to different printers.In my case, my review is positive because it works fine with my black and white laser printer and has enough thickness that I can print on both sides without any major issues. How it does with inkjets and in high volume cases? I can’t say, honestly. But as one of two students in a household with maybe 5-7 pages of printing a week total, this works fine and is a great value! If I have to make copies, I can do that at home and it doesn’t cost much and looks fine. Normal brightness, works fine, printer takes one sheet at a time without issues. (Thinner papers sometimes jam printers—this one seems to be ok!)",5,0,2019-4-25,1,0,0
"Amazon throws its hat in yet another ring, this time it's standard 92 copy paper. This 8-ream box nestles into the usual crowd of hammerhill, hp, staples and other brands, and there seems to be little to set it apart.  The print quality is similar to the Staples or Office Depot brands, the price is similar at present, and so on.It's not premium quality, and it's not premium price. I tend to take my chances and use ""copy paper"" like this in my home office printers rather than laser printer paper. It's cheaper and works fine, today's printers don't seem to get gunked up with lots of fine paper particles that ruin them.",5,0,2019-5-6,1,0,0
"You would think that reviewing something like blank paper would be pretty simple. I don't think that I have ever seen so much drama in the review section for something as simple as blank paper though. I got this paper in yesterday and unsurprisingly it's just simple, blank paper, like every other blank paper I have ever bought.I've been using it today in my Canon office printer/copier and it feeds through and is printed on quite easily. No surprises. I have bought paper in the past that has bunched up or gotten stuck in the paper feed. I had no such problems with this paper though.",5,0,2019-4-17,1,0,0
I use a lot of paper and print a lot of items.  What I detest most is going to the supply store and having to lug home a case of paper.  It is heavy and cumbersome.  The best part of these purchase experience is that it is delivered and when the case comes you can open it and take two or three reams at a time into your home office and use them as needed.The quality of the paper is high and the colors come out true and good.  I have a laser jet printer and did some pictures with this paper and they were true and very excellent.,5,0,2019-7-5,1,0,0
"This AmazonBasics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper is a quality copy paper for its class and brightness. Its thickness is such that it works well for copying and printing. The paper is smooth rather than coarse. I have had no issues with the paper jamming while going through the duplex process. I have had no issues with the paper feeding properly. The paper has not curled on me or done anything for which I can make a negative remark. We have a family business and use a lot of paper so if there were problems with this paper, we would have experienced those problems. I can recommend this paper for printers, copiers and for any other normal use of copy paper.",5,0,2019-5-22,1,0,0
"I have a home office using a Canon MX870 printer.  AmazonBasics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper when printing text, images, flyers, brochures, and making copies of documents using the scanner (B/W & Color).  In all uses, the printing was crisp with sharply defined edges, large sections of color didn't ripple, double-sided printing didn't bleed through, and most importantly the printer never jammed (with some other brands I've had 1-4 jams per ream and with this paper none so far).Since printers vary and I used this paper for home office use, not large business use, your results may vary.  But with the quality of the paper for my uses, it was above average.",5,0,2019-6-23,1,0,0
"I am really impressed with this basic 20 lb paper.  I compared it to another brand of 20 lb, 92 brightness multi-purpose paper that I have and I find the Amazon Basics brand is a consistent white throughout the page, while the other brand name paper has a spotty appearance.  Look at the picture I took with the two side by side (Amazon brand on the left).  They are both 20 lb and 92 brightness, yet the Amazon Basics looks noticeably better because of its consistency throughout the page.  I looked at more than these two sheets to make sure it wasn’t just a fluke, and all the Amazon sheets have the same white look consistent throughout the sheet, while the other name brand sheets are spotty.",5,0,2019-4-20,1,0,1

If I want to do something on better paper, I can just switch it out.I had no problems with it printing in my Brother 8360CDW laser printer. I didn't experience any creasing or problems at all with it.  This carton of paper is a real bargain for basic printing of handouts, sales reciepts, etc.... If your business needs a more 'professional' paper then this isn't the paper for you.",4,0,2019-4-12,1,0,0
"This is the product that just caused our law firm to ban Amazon Basics. We had tried other products from this line, hoping to realize savings and having faith in Amazon's reputation. Most of these products have been disappointing but the paper is terrible. The biggest problem is that our commercial Ricoh printer just jams constantly with this paper. It would jam in 5-6 places at once, too. We've never had that problem before. There were repeated service calls. We were advised to try different paper. We did. Problem solved.The worst part: the next batch of paper was cheaper because of an Office Depot special. In fact, our policy is always to buy the cheapest possible paper because of the volume we use. Only Amazon screwed up the commercial printer/copier.",1,0,2017-5-29,1,0,0
"If you need to print stuff that is either disposable, or plain text, then this is really what you want. Works better with LaserJet in my opinion, but it prints well with that that level of printing on an inkjet without too much bleeding. Anything more sophisticated, and even color, you might want a higher quality paper. This case of paper gets you 8 reams of 500 sheets each that works out to about $4.50 a ream. Paper has gotten pricey these days, and comparatively, that's one of the best prices you will find at case prices.",4,0,2019-4-24,1,0,0
"I tried one of the new reams on a ~35 page document with colors and highlighting on my Epson Inkjet.  The print quality was attractive and high contrast.  I will note, but this could be due to how I loaded the printer, but some of the pages were slightly bent out of shape.  Unless other reviewers find the same result I would assume this is due to my own lack of care.  I was pleased with the brightness and contrast of the paper and find it in every way comparable to major name brands such as Hammermill and HP.",5,0,2019-4-11,1,0,0
"I'm using this paper with my two inkjet printers, and it works very well indeed. I print primarily b/w manuscript pages, with occasional color copies, and it's been fine for both. The paper is practically identical to the Staples brand multipurpose copy paper I'd been using, so it boils down to price and convenience. 8 reams of this Basics paper will last me a long time, and if the mail deliverer doesn't break her back hauling the heavy box, I'll probably order it again when I run out. Recommended.",5,0,2019-5-2,1,0,0
I was super disappointed that the box of reams came totally broken in shipment... I like to keep paper boxes for storage and whatever... other than that - its copy paper. White. Paper-like.

"I typically use 20-pound, 96-bright multipurpose paper from Staples in an HP laser printer to print packing slips. It is suitable for my needs. Staples typically offers rebates, so I have to pay full price and then apply for the rebate, which is a pain.This paper from Amazon is only 92 bright, so it's not quite as white, but the difference is quite subtle. It won't matter for general printing. This is not a paper one uses for presentations or high quality printing, so it shouldn't be judged against such papers.",2,0,2017-2-21,1,0,0
"I usually buy Hammermill copy paper for the office but after the last batch (terrible quality!), I tried AmazonBasics. For roughly the same price, we received a much better copy paper and no issues. Yes, it is plain old copy paper but the brightness and copy quality comes out just fine. Presentation-wise, I took a point off...it is thin (20lb.) so I use 28 lb. paper instead if I need to preserve or make higher quality print-outs. Overall, it's a good value.",5,0,2019-4-16,1,0,0
This isnt worth the cost at all. You can get a similar paper from other places. Just search in your favorite search engine.

"Affordable, lightweight, multipurpose copy paper from Amazon won’t disappoint. Feeds smoothly through my Epson printer and provides bright and clear copies each time.

This paper is much better than the last paper I bought which was so thin you couldn't print double sided because it showed through. I can print double sided on this paper no problem. It is bright white and perfect for almost anything you need to print. It is acid-free and archival quality as well. I make journals and this paper will be perfect for making signatures for my journals. The price appears to be in line with comparable brands.

"I really like this paper. It is thick and bright white. The price was good, it is very good quality, and the colors really pop. Works well with our Canon Color ImageClass printer. I will definitely buy again.The only downfall is that the box was pieced together. It looked like they tried to fit all 10 reams into a box that was made for 8 reams? And when that didn't work, another box was taped on. The actually had tape sticking to some of the reams, so the paper packaging tore a bit when I took it out of the box.

"I'm not sure that I will buy this product again.  I have been very happy so far with AmazonBasics products, in fact I seek them out, as I have found them to be of good value so far.  The quality of this paper, however, disappoints.  The weight  of the paper seems fine, but the colour of the paper is noticeably off-white, especially when compared to a four-year-old page of HP Print and Copy paper with the same brightness specification.The bigger problem, however, was the condition of the paper on receipt.  Again, I have always found Amazon to be extraordinarily good at packing.  My paper arrived loose in a larger box, with two other smaller items that I had purchased.  The paper wrapping around the ream is thin, and provides little protection to the paper inside.  Both ends of the paper wrapping had partially burst, and the corners of the ream were damaged.  This means that most of the 500 sheets in this ream will be dented or rippled, and would not be suitable for business use.",1,1,2019-4-5,0,2,0
"It is not a bright white, it's more eggshell but good for your basic business or school printing needs that you'll eventually shred after. I wouldn't use it for things that you'll want to either share or keep yourself for the longer term. Good value for the price. I read a lot of people got their package all beat up, but they packed mine great. I didn't have any other orders so it was packed on it's own which is maybe the trick. If this review helped please click on the ""helped"" thing haha. Again, this paper is decent for your everyday needs. Doesn't seem to soak up ink or smear so far.

El mejor papel al mejor precio-calidad!Pros:,5,1,2018-8-22,0,1,0
Just received box containing 3 rims of papers (1500 pages). Papers are bright (92 GE) and has decent thickness (20 lb weight). Both sides feels very smooth. I tried HP Officejet printer and colors and printing is very good. Due to good brightness and smoothness text looks sharp and colors looks vivid. Papers are acid-free which means they will not turn yellow over the time. Papers have slight bluish tint which may be an issue for highly professional printing but it's not a big issue in general purpose printing.For a price this is great value. With my prime membership an additional 20% discount which we bonus.,5,1,2017-6-4,0,1,0
"One would think this is just regular paper, but I dislike it greatly. I've bought many brands, from premium HP paper to the dollar store stacks, and I went for this one because it was the best deal, but I regret it a lot because of one simple reason: it CONSTANTLY jams my printer. As a matter of fact, I'm printing a document as I'm writing this review and it jammed twice.  I've swapped paper to see if the issue was with my printer, but the problem went away -- it really only (and constantly) happens with this paper.",1,1,2019-10-18,0,5,0
"Very good paper for general household use and even small business. I dropped it by a star as when I print 2 sided, you can see through slightly. Not enough for most to be concerned about but I certainly wouldn't send a 2 sided invoice or important document out. For the price, very good for general day to day printing and copyingUPDATE:  I used a highlighter on this paper and it is not as thick as I had hoped as it bled through.  If you are not going to be highlighting 2 sided documents you will be fine but if you plan on doing highlighting, best to up the quality. I dropped it from my original 4 stars to 3",3,1,2019-11-28,0,4,0
"This paper should be left in the amazon's stockroom to use for a liner to boxes before shipment. Although I read the reviews, both positive and more negative prior to my purchase. I should have relied on the negative comments to stop me from ordering this print paper. This paper causes too many paper jams in my printer. It leaves smudge on the top of some print-outs. It is too light-weight, no possibilities for class. More than one page comes out of my printer for just one copy. Then, I experienced a bigger paper jam today where I had to basically turn my printer up-side down to remove the paper jam. I am saving this paper for my grandchildren and their friends to draw on when they visit me. I will also use this paper to write my notes on that do not require printing. It is not even good for scanning. What a waste of money, now I will have to return to Staples to purchase their copy paper, I have been using for the past ten years.",2,1,2020-5-5,0,1,0

"I used to work for staples so I have seen all kinds of paper and for the price, this seems reasonable. 92 bright, 20lbs generally costs $7-10 per ream (maybe lucky if you find it for $5 but I haven't see that kind of price in a while... inflation right?).I'm just really unhappy with the way this was handled and shipped. The box was all beat up, the reams teared up and the box was left in the snow so all the paper at the bottom got wet... Hopefully the replacement is much better.",2,1,2018-1-3,0,4,1
