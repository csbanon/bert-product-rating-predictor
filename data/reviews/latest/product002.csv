It’s an awesome computer.I had an old MacBook Air that stoped working (my fault) so had to get a new one.,4,1,2020-5-20,1,2,0
I can’t even put into words how much I love my MacBook! At first I was hesitant to spend so much! But after buying 3 different computers in the past 5 years. I took a leap and bought a MacBook after many research and many great reviews! So far I LOVE MINE!! It took some getting use to coming from an HP to a MacBook. But I picked up quickly.,5,1,2020-8-1,1,4,0
"With the exception of a 24-hour period previously, this is my first Mac. In fact, I just moved over to Apple products recently after being anti such for many years.The first one arrived with that retina laminate bubble problem many are speaking of. Requested replacement through Amazon immediately and a replacement arrived the next day. So far, this screen seems fine. The camera is definitely a gripe. However, if I am being honest, I never used the webcam on my previous PC (which luckily still works and has a great camera) until the pandemic. My guess is most people wouldn't have even noticed or been inconvenienced by the low grade quality of the camera on the MBA 2020 if it weren't for the current circumstances and what is now a greater need for the technology. These are expensive machines (obviously) so I definitely made sure to buy a protective case for it as well as a keyboard cover.",4,1,2020-6-25,1,3,0
Such a hassle to return...the screen Glitch could give someone seizures. Must have been mishandled during delivery.,1,1,2020-6-22,1,7,0
I just received my Macbook Air about an hour ago. Its so pretty. Its working good. The camera quality isn’t the best. Its like the quality of the IPhone 11 Pro Max when you first get it lol. But its not bad. I like it. Nothing is wrong with it so far. Came brand new. Its nice & cute.I bought Apple Care with it also. For the price.. ITS AMAZING,5,1,2020-5-23,1,6,1
"I received this item on April 22, 2020 and the same day I got it, my wife already started getting keyboard problems with the spacebar. I looked up some research and apparently the butterfly keyboard design is giving a TON of people all sorts of issues. We even tried installing the Unshaky app, and mess with the apple keyboard preferences. I honesty think charging this much money with a flaw design is a waste of money, especially at this stage for Apple. They're are a lot of other laptops that will work better than this.",2,1,2020-4-22,1,5,0
I love my MacBook Air. It takes a little learning curve if you're coming from a Windows PC environment but easy to learn. Having an iPhone MS Max and a iPad Pro helped in the learning curve. The only negative is that I'm disappointed in the battery life. I need to charge it every 3-4 days.,4,1,2020-7-9,1,4,0
"I requested a Gold laptop but got a Rose one. The sticker at the bottom of the box states it is Gold, but the picture on the top of the box shows a Rose laptop. Is this a Chinese joke on us? The laptop works great, but I was expecting the Gold laptop I actually requested! Am I color blind?",3,1,2020-4-21,1,6,0
Two things stop this laptop from being acceptable.1. If you do video conferencing you're going to look pixelated to other attendees.  The camera is unacceptable even for a MBA.,2,1,2020-7-10,1,2,0
"In my opinion, the 2020 MacBook Air is a perfect laptop. It has physical keys that are a pleasure to type on, a beautiful screen, an optimal size, good pricing, and a quad-core processor. The only ""touch"" button is the fingerprint sensor and the touch pad. The onboard graphics are as good as discrete graphics from a few years ago according to benchmarks, which is impressive. The speakers work well. Being an educator, I purchased it on the Apple Education Store for $1200, and it couldn't have come at a better time, given the transition to Zoom in the coronavirus pandemic. Thank you, Apple, for rediscovering yourself. I had been holding onto my 2012 MacBook Pro because I was unimpressed with the offerings the past few years.You shouldn't get this if you are looking for onboard power, but if you are, you probably didn't need me to tell you that. Otherwise, get it. It's great.",5,0,2020-3-28,1,5,0
"It didn't take too long to show up and I absolutely love it. The gold is a nice color, not too yellow. It's more of a rose gold which I absolutely adore. The keys are nice and smooth and the screen it bright. It holds a nice charge, especially when I play the sims with a pretty bright screen. Its fast too, which is a HUGE step up from my last computer. Overall I'm very very pleased with my purchase.",5,1,2020-5-2,1,5,0
"I had a Macbook Pro that I have had around 5 years or so. I loved that computer and it served me well. I had virtually no problems with it during the five years that I had owned  it. It recently died on me and would no longer boot up correctly. Since it was time for an upgrade I decided to buy a new laptop instead of getting my old one fixed. This time around I opted for the Macbook Air since it was a little more price friendly. I also don't do too much heavy lifting on my computer besides surfing the internet, work and watching videos. The MacBook Air is a dream so far!One thing to note is that it looks more rose gold than gold. If you have the iPhone 11 Pro Max it is not that sort of gold. It looks pink to my eyes. Pink is my favorite color so I LOVE IT! But if you want a more traditional gold color you may be disappointed. I love the new finger print sensor. It makes unlocking your computer super easy and you don't have to type your password a million times. I have not really missed the USB thingy and standard headphones do work so that's a plus. So far this computer is boss. Apple never really disappoints me though so take that with a grain a salt.  :)",5,1,2020-4-30,1,1,0
"It has been widely reported that the camera on the 2020 MacBook Air is low quality, but mine was definitely in the non-acceptable range. Picture was very grainy, unfocused, and low light level. I strongly suspect the glass in front of the video chip was damaged, perhaps for a contamination during assembly, but have now way of checking directly. Cleaning the outside had no effect.With heavy heart, I decided to return the unit, and buy an equivalent from the big-box store, where quality can (and will) be checked before purchasing.",2,1,2020-4-1,1,2,0
"The original MacBook Air is retailing for like $749.99 right now. Don't buy that. It looks ugly and it's old. Buy the new refreshed 2020 model. This model is authentic, straight from Apple, and it looks fresh.One downside: Open it in a garage or something. I opened it in my room and my room smells like aluminum. Overall, this is a really good product for day-to-day use.",5,1,2020-3-29,1,2,0
my first and only macbook pro was purchased in 05/06. needless to say i was due for an upgrade. i was never a fan of the macbook air so i started researching the macbook pro. i quickly learned that most people i knew who had pro’s switched to the air when it came time to buy a new laptop. they all swear by it.  amazon didnt have any of the new pro’s in stock which is what finally pushed me over to the air. some reviews were iffy especially about the camera quality so i was very nervous. my laptop was delivered yesterday and i could not be happier that i chose the new macbook air! its perfect! while it does not come with the touch bar it does bring touch ID. many of the forums i read said the touch bar is great but you can live without it and after time it starts to fail. not sure how true that it as im sure itll improve over time.the air is so light weight. i got the 13inch and it doesn't feel crammed or too small like most air laptop do in previous models. the retina display is beautiful!,5,1,2020-5-12,1,2,1

"For the average or small business person this computer will do more than enough and is a vast improvement over previous models. Catalina OS though sucks, otherwise would have given it a 5 rating. Problem is a lot of software I need for work is limited or won't work with Catalina. Yeah, you can take a chance and transition back to High Sierra or whatever but that's not a task I would want to handle myself personally and in checking with several computer guys in the area its not worth the cost, puts the price right back up to where the MacBook Airs were priced before. Keyboard is heaven, processor is fast enough for the most part, other than Catalina its great. Apple, get your act together, Catalina is not what most people want or need in my opinion.",4,1,2020-4-1,1,1,0
"What an upgrade over the 2017 Macbook air! Retina, magic keyboard, speakers, smaller form factor, finger print something-or-other, etc. When you hold it in your hand(s) it feel like a solid pice of aluminum. Totally pimptastic to the max. Getcha some!",5,1,2020-3-31,1,1,0
"Amazon does not check this product for manufacturing defects. When my computer arrived the screen has bubbles in it and they are very large ones. For the price of this computer it should be defect free! When I tried to contact Amazon Customer service I get this ""Currently Unavailable."" I am stuck with this expensive computer and it's defects. I cannot return it because I need it for my business. I wanted Amazon to replace it but That option is ""Currently Unavailable"" too. The camera on this computer is grainy and low quality. I'm not sure if that is a defect too or if that is  just the quality of the camera. If you buy this item through Apple they will make sure the product is free from defects although it will cost a bit more. You have to decide that for yourself. I am very disappointed with this product and Amazon for not giving me the support I needed with this product.",1,1,2020-5-1,1,7,0
The new magic keyboard is amazing when typing. Unlike the 2019 MacBook Air. It’s so amazing how you pay $999 for double the storage you got form last year that’s starts at $1099. It’s is very fast and smooth. The only thing I don’t like is the noisy fan. The reason for this is because the MacBook is trying to run at its full potential for some stuff so from keeping it firm overheating the fan turns on. Besides that you should get it.,4,1,2020-4-6,1,2,0

"I’ve used PC since I could remember. I decided to upgrade and I don’t regret it. This laptop is so tiny but an absolute powerhouse of machinery. The speed is impeccable and the overall performance is even better.I can easily run Photoshop, Netflix & Google Chrome with 5+ open tabs and the laptop does NOT heat up or slow down. It stays cool and runs as if the applications weren’t in use at all. I don’t use other apps besides Facebook messenger, which might be the reason why the laptop otherwise has a lot of give.",5,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
Three weeks in. Mac user since 1994. Badly wishing I purchased another laptop for work.Apple .. not sure what's happened with your products. My last two iPhones have infested with bugginess. Now this MacBook Air.,2,1,2020-5-18,1,1,0
"I'm a computer technician and I'm also an author (ghost writer technically, so nothing is actually published in my name).  As a computer technician I would give this computer a 1/5.  It's a disposable paper bag with a horrible cooling system.  If one minor thing goes wrong with it, it's toast.  Soldered on SSD and RAM, very few modular components, etc.  So why did I buy it?Well, as an author I need a computer with a good keyboard that's lightweight and has a long battery life.  For writing and reading articles online, this computer is great.  If you need to do ANYTHING else however (including watching YouTube videos - which wouldn't be taxing on any other computer), you should choose a different computer.  The cooling system I mentioned?  It's basically non-existent.  The fan isn't connected to the heat sink at all.  This means that if you use the computer for anything taxing at all (YouTube videos, games, photo editing, etc.) it's going to overheat.  This will cause the computer to die in about a year or two, and when it does, the cost for repair is going to be close to $1,000 because of the way Apple designed it.",3,1,2020-6-13,1,1,0

"The camera has a poor image quality (only 720p) and the fan gets very loud during FaceTime/Zoom calls. The MacBook Air 2020, like the MacBook Air 2018 and 2019, has very poor thermal design because there is no pipe to connect the fan to the CPU's heatsink.The MacBook Air 2020 is suitable for causal use. But even a video call will push the CPU's temperature to a 100 degrees celsius. Because of the poor thermal design, the fan becomes loud and the device will thermal throttle (meaning it limits the CPU's speed in order to reduce its temperature). This was not a present problem in MacBook Air devices produced before 2018 as the CPUs in those devices were properly cooled (the fan was connected to the CPU with a pipe).",1,1,2020-5-18,1,8,1
This MacBook Air is extremely slow. Right out the box it was slow and even after updating it is still slow and seems to only be getting slower day by day. Returning. Avoid this rip-ff at all cost.,1,1,2020-4-6,1,4,0
I am in love best investment that I have made.  I have been working from home and taking online classes.  Makes it so convent and easy.  Love the sound and feel of the keyboard. Webcam sucks but that’s not why I got it.,5,1,2020-5-7,1,3,1
"I suspect the MacBook Air I received was used. The computer could not found the hard drive, when I tried to use the recovery option, surprise, the computer was locked, possibly by the previous owner. It had fingerprints in the screen and the keyboard. I'm very dissapointed with Anazon, it's the first time I bought a NEW Macbook and instead received something that looks like being used, unusable and locked. Returned immediately.",1,1,2020-5-25,1,3,1
"The laptop came in really good packaging and was really nice out of the box. But when I was starting everything up, the screen automatically went black and the fans turned on at a very high level. I called the apple support line but their methods of trying to restart the computer did not work. Very upset on how this turned out!",1,1,2020-4-26,1,2,0
"So, between apples new keyboard, and with the government c19 rebate coming, I figured it was time I got a new laptop. I couldn't be happier with it. The machine itself is lighting fast, and the keyboard is just a hair short of orgasmic. The new key switches add the perfect amount of weight to the keys that frankly make it exhilarating to type on. The battery life has been pretty much as advertised, as expected with . No complaints there. My only gripe, if I have one, is the camera on it is kind of garbage. I mean it's functional, and after this pandemic thing is over Ill likely never use it again, so its a small gripe. But still. As far as shipping goes, Amazon didn't fail to deliver. Initially I planned to just buy it from Apple directly, but they were talking about 3 weeks out before it would ship. Checked over here, and, though I couldn't get the upgraded ram chip I wanted, I got the computer in 3 days during a pandemic. Actually two days before it was promised. Well done, Amazon. Another smile delivered.",5,1,2020-4-8,1,2,0
"I purchased this hoping for the best but honestly, if you are used to a faster processor, do not buy this computer. If you’re looking for a basic computer to do basic things like surfing the internet and running a few different things at the same time but nothing major like video editing, then this computer is for you. I am honestly disappointed they would put an i3 processor in their base model computer but I guess you can’t get everything. Other than that, the size was definitely smaller than I’m comfortable with. Before purchasing, consider the speed because it will completely alter your experience in the long term.",2,1,2020-4-29,1,7,0
"I ordered my MacBook Air from Apple within an hour of its announcement and have been enjoying it for a few days. I'm upgrading from a 2018 retina MacBook Air, and the 2020 model is a very worthwhile upgrade for a few reasons.First, the new keyboard really lives up to the hype.  I didn't hate the butterfly keyboard, but I didn't like typing on it nearly as much as the scissor-mechanism keyboards of the older MacBook Airs and pre-2016 MacBook pros.  Plus, I've had two machines with the butterfly keyboard (the other was the 2016 MB Pro with Touch Bar, that my employer provided me to use at work).  Both had problems with repeating keys, and in the case of Pro I use at work, some key presses randomly triggered some of the Touch Bar functions.",5,0,2020-3-30,1,3,0
I ordered  a silver but got gold color!Specs are the same as I had requested though. Given current circumstances.. where I need a laptop badly to work from home...I don’t have a choice but to accept it.,1,1,2020-4-3,1,1,0
"Came in sealed. Easy to set-up. The screen is beautiful. The Magic Keyboard feels very nice and a definite upgrade from the previous butterfly mechanism. The camera quality is just what I need. If you are going to be at school or at work doing zoom calls with other people, they can see you clearly. The camera, in my opinion, could definitely be improved, especially because of that high price. That seems to be the only “flaw.” Lastly, I will talk about the fan noise and the MacBook “heating up.” In my personal use, the MacBook never heated up (even on the bottom) and the fan was only heard just a bit when I was downloading a large app file. From day-to-day use of browsing, Netflix, zoom calls, and presentations, you would most likely never hear the fan nor feel the heat from underneath your keyboard. I’d definitely recommend this computer, especially if it’s your first Mac. Enjoy!Update: After less than a week of purchasing, this MacBook still works fantastic. However, once I started up Minecraft and played creative for just 2 minutes, the fan started blasting and was very loud. I do not suggest this computer if you want to game, however, for daily usage, it's wonderful.",5,1,2020-4-14,1,1,0
"I’m giving it four stars, because I guess I don’t need that much space on my MacBook. I wish I would’ve saved myself the extra $300 or some dollars by getting the lesser SSD storage space version. Other than that. It’s a nice laptop and worth the extra $49 amazon charges over apple for the faster delivery.I will update my review once I start using my MacBook more.",4,1,2020-5-6,1,5,0
"So far it’s been a killer of a laptop! The keyboard is pretty great and it sounds and feels great to type on. I actually want to write with my laptop now. I got the i3 model, and as it doesn’t sound impressive I think it’s the best option for the MacBook Air as this laptop does have overheating issues (hence the 4/5 stars) and as the i3 doesn’t require as much power as an i5 or i7, it doesn’t have as bad of throttling issues. It remains fast enough for my needs as well, it also has enough storage for my 25GB of music, my entire 20GB of google drive and all my apps, and it runs them all pretty fast, including Adobe Lightroom.TLDR: A fast little laptop with great build and aesthetic, improved keyboard, great speakers (for a laptop), and a lower than average MacBook price. But with overheating issues (wait for the next MacBook Pro if you want to avoid the heat issue). 5-Stars",4,1,2020-4-7,1,2,0
"I first bought the lowest-priced MacBook Air which has the lowest capacity SSD of all available. When it showed up at my house, I was surprised at how sluggish it was. I read some reviews, and realized that Apple didn't make it clear (at least to me) that the lowest-priced Air also has a slower, dual core processor. It makes sense in hindsight, but I digress. I returned that Air, and replaced it with the 500+GB SSD and quad core processor. Wow! The difference in performance is marked! Multitasking, turning on from sleep, everything is MUCH quicker and smoother than with the dual core processor. If you can afford the higher-priced model, I really recommend it!Overall, the MacBook Air is really a beautiful machine aesthetically. I the recycled aluminum exterior is slick and high-end. The onboard speaker won't ever be confused for an external sound system, but it is the best onboard speaker system I've heard. The Retina screen looks great; vibrant and detailed. I also love the large touch pad with the gestures.",5,1,2020-4-26,1,2,0
"I’m extremely disappointed. As soon as I turned it on the fan was on super loud, it was slow and when I started time machine to begin a new backup it took forever. It was brand new out of the box and it sadly sucks. I’m returning after having it for a day. I had my IT family member  take a look and they could no believe how slow it was. It rebooted on its own twice within the first hour of using it. I’m sadly returning it. I need a computer but this ain’t worth it. Save yourself and find something else. I’m a huge Apple fan but this really is awful.",1,1,2020-5-18,1,2,0
"The computer kept crashing!! It would start up, freeze and restart. I paid too much money for that to happen. I sent it back for a refund. I’m sooooo disappointed!",1,1,2020-4-21,1,2,0
"Received and set up computer and began using it.  In the very first hours I was informed I needed an OS update.  This is precisely why I wanted to get away from Windows. So after some time the download failed. A few days later I allowed it to do it again and this time it was successful in the eyes of Apple.  Now my password was required to use the fingerprint feature and I soon discovered my password no longer worked. I got on the phone with Apple support and finally was able to open up my computer. Then I found out I needed to open or create iCloud account. I had already done that. To make a long story short it now believes I have two computers, the Apple air Mac and Craig's Apple air Mac. I'm seriously considering returning it. I don't need to pay nearly $1,000 for this aggravation when I can get a Chromebook that will satisfy my computer needs for a third of that price.",2,1,2020-7-10,1,5,0
"Ive only had my MacBook for 2 days but I love it. First of all, the gold color is too cute. It is so compact and a great size laptop, I love it! it works as fast as is user friendly as you would expect from a MacBook. I've only owned MacBooks so I stuck with what I knew. The tracking pad took me a minute to get used to, but I like it. A few things I can't stand though: The keyboard sucks. It is a little awkward typing because you can't really feel the keys. They are too flat. Also, why is there no USB-A input?!! You have to buy an adapter for USB-A and to charge your phone. For a $1000 computer, you would think they could throw that in there.

Well I have a Mac mini already so  am already familiar with Mac OS and the Mac experience in general so a lot of good qualities thereof did not come as a surprise, but as I casually played a song I was like WOW where is this stereo sound coming from? I have a pair of bluetooth Harman-Kardon speakers in my bedroom so I was thinking maybe it automatically connected to my laptop and this is where the sound is coming from.Now I never really thought of using my laptop to play music as, like I said,  I have other devices that are more capable of that but now I am thinking it seems like a good idea because my external speakers are too strong and might cause noise for my downstairs neighbor especially late in the evening.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,3,0

"This computer was an upgrade for a 2008 MacBook Pro. The aforementioned computer was my first Mac computer. It lasted a very long time and it's still working, but I had to upgrade because I'm writing code for my job and the platform we use would not load on my old computer. My old Mac was a MacBook Pro 13' 512GB and 4GBs of RAM. I know I know. I upgraded with a MacBook Air 2020 for $1199.00 512GBSSD,  8GBs of RAM I5. The fan is on after about fifteen or twenty  minutes of internet browsing and you hear it in high definition, without much load at all the fan is on and it's not turning off. What ever battery life Apple says you're getting its on the lowest display setting so forgetaboutit. I turn my display up to about seventy five percent and that gives me about five hours of use unplugged.

"I had initially ordered this computer in July 7th and upon arrival I noticed the box it shipped in was completely torn, as if it had been thrown around multiple times. Once it opened it, the apple box was greasy and dirty, even the laptop itself was dirty, had minor damage and was apparently used. Keep in mind, I had ordered a new item. I called support and they immediately ordered a replacement for me. I expressed the need to have it home desperately since I need it for work and I was told that since I’m considered international shipping, I would have to wait 7 days for it. Well, I agreed but mentioned that I needed him to reassure me that it would in fact arrive upon this estimated time since I couldn’t wait longer. Well, it was supposed to be delivered today and it’s late, hasn’t even been updated in Tracking Information since the 23rd and is apparently still in Miami when I live in Puerto Rico. So basically, I have been almost an entire month waiting for what I ordered. Please refrain yourself from ordering here if you’re interested in getting a quality product.

It has done that SEVERAL times since then. One afternoon, I was watching YouTube and the sound randomly went out. It also often restarts on its own.

The machine looked good. I liked the darker gray. It was faster than my older MacBook Air. (E.g. 3-times faster on shut-down.)I was disappointed that battery life wasn't improved.,4,1,2020-8-26,1,3,0
"I’m upgrading from a 2014 MacBook Air, and the things I like and dislike are largely the same (that’s not a bad thing!)The form factor is not new, but it is still great. It’s the perfect size and weight if you ask me; It slips into a backpack or carryon easily but it is perfectly useable. My last model lasted forever without problems. The hinge is nice, the body feels just right.",4,1,2020-5-10,1,6,0
"I bought this laptop a week ago. It starts with frequently lagging when I click the mouse. Then, the UI becomes cranky and clunky. I didn’t pay much attention, but today, when I do a post on PowerPoint. It was suddenly shut down the PowerPoint. I lost all the progress I did before.Update: three time shutdown. Larger storage is necessary.",1,1,2020-4-15,1,9,0
"I've been needing to upgrade from my 8 year old MacBook Air for the last few months but wanted to wait for the 2020 model. The time has arrived and this product did not disappoint.First off, the gold color is vibrant. I didn't have a hard time migrating all my data and apps from my old MacBook to this new one (took maybe 3 hours, but I have iCloud), and everything is running seamlessly so far. Fast performance and will definitely be of great use once I get to editing all of my photos.",5,1,2020-4-9,1,8,0
This product is defected.  It has a faulty power supply.  Not even 2 week with this new laptop its defected.  I requested a refund and was short $100.  Be careful when ordering through 3rd party.  Even if you return the item before the estimated allowance they will still charge 20% restocking fee.  Why should I pay $100 for a defected item?  Not a happy customer!!! Very disappointed.  No I will definitely be more careful whom I purchase from.,1,1,2020-7-17,1,9,0
"I got this  a week ago and have been loving it. I mostly got it to replace my old 2012 Mac mini. I just plan on using it for light work using Xcode, transferring files on external drives, web surfing and movie watching.i5, 512ssd ram and 8gb ram. I don't recommend this for playing video games.

I dont like that I paid all this money and it hasn't been a good month and they closed the return window I'm having so many problems with this it's crazy freezes all the time you cant power it off the cursor gets stuck and wont respond...bluetooth doesnt work I guess that's why they close the return window so early but doesnt tell you about the return before you purchase it ...I need my laptop to work its fir my business and if I cant get into my files when I need it what's the point ....,1,1,2020-6-23,1,9,0

"From the perspective of someone who uses both Mac and PC. I wanted to give this a try because a few friends had recommended the new air to me. I didn’t expect much, but I got even less than expected. It’s just not very good. Yes, it’s a Mac product and it does work, but super slowly. It heats up very fast, and if you try having two applications open at the same time it freezes up. I don’t know why this has so many good reviews, other than people reviewing that don’t use their computer much/only like the look of a Mac. I recommend spending more to get something worth having, which is not this computer.",1,1,2020-6-30,1,1,0
"I was so excited to buy this computer! I had a mac from 2004-2012, and I loved that machine. It was a tank!  However, this from the moment I opened the box was a huge letdown. This is just my personal preference but it feels so delicate,  and like I'm going to break it at any moment. I automatically knew I was going to need a case for it.  The second thing that shocked me was how hot the bottom of the machine got almost instantly. Just surfing the internet caused it to heat up way more than my 5 year old Acer laptop (that barely turns on most days.) Thirdly, this thing gets loud! And that's just from watching videos while doing some very basic work. It's not the Macs of old that I remembered and loved and I decided it just wasnt worth the expense to have something I wasnt 100% happy with.",3,1,2020-6-20,1,6,0
"This is my first Apple laptop. It came very nicely wrapped in an original box from Apple. It did warm up a tiny bit when I was on a long Zoom call, but nothing crazy. It is fairly different (frustrating) from a Windows computer when it came to using their Pages, so I'll definitely be downloading Microsoft Office. It does have a very sleek, minimalistic look, which is how they get you to pay almost 1k for it. I was very disappointed in the camera, terrible qualify, which is why I gave it 3 stars, unacceptable. I feel like even my Acer from 4 years ago has a better cam than this thing. Overall, I think it will do what I need it to do, which is to be sleek and light for the purposes of going to class. This will not convert into an Apple fan girl, I can tell already. Camera alone should make this $150 cheaper.",3,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
"I was really excited to use my new Macbook however I was very dissapointed when I used it for a few days. The two biggest things this laptop is missing is a better processor (the 10th gen i3 just isn't enough to run Photoshop or any program efficiently) and it has a 720p camera. WTF Apple? What year is it.  I dont think I've had any camera in 720p in over 6 years. The retina display is nice as always but it IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE!! You can get a much nicer laptop around the same price or cheaper. Look into the Lenovo Flex(i7, 16gb ram, 512gb ssd) is what I recommend.",2,1,2020-6-27,1,1,0
"First, I am a loyal Mac user. I ""upgraded"" from a (base model) late-2013 MacBook Pro to this Air assuming I was getting a better product. For the most part, this computer is awesome. Its a brand new Macbook. What's not to love?Well, in the age of coronavirus, two crucial things, the camera and the i3's inability to use virtual backgrounds on Zoom. I was shocked the first time that I used the webcam on this and, even though I thoroughly research the device, I did not really realize how antiquated this tech is. The picture is grainy, low-res, and inadequate for my needs. So, then I tried to use a virtual background. I received a notice that I needed an i5 processor in order to use that feature.",2,1,2020-5-21,1,9,0
After reading a couple reviews about the front camera I’ve come to find out that this is an common issue with macbooks coming from amazon and the support for this issue they offer is not any good,1,1,2020-4-23,1,1,0
"I was really looking forward to this laptop. I bought a refurbished MacBook last summer that I was going to give my daughter with the intention of keeping this one. It really is a new MacBook, unopened in box, which i was worried about not being. Five minutes after turning it on the keys felt hot, as well as the bottom of the computer. There was no fan noise. I looked up online ""MacBook 2020 heating up"" and found that people where complaining about it heating up and the fan loudly kicking in when using heavier video conferencing software. For a nearly 1k computer, that is unacceptable. The refurbished 2017 one doesn't even heat up! I will sadly have to return this :( Sucks, because it's beautifully designed, the keys are quiet and the fingerprint feature impressive. But I cannot get over it heating up the way it did.",3,1,2020-7-18,1,8,0
I purchased this MacAir to use for 6-8 hours of distance learning and teaching during The Corona pandemic. On day one of using the laptop after 6 hours of continuous use the machine had overheated to the point that even the internal fan could not keep it cool. The laptop was excessively hot to the touch. I unplugged it and contacted Apple. The customer service rep at Apple stated this particular laptop had had some cooling issues and made a suggestion for another model.,4,1,2020-5-17,1,9,0
"Battery life is garbage:  *maybe 3 hours when only surfing the web.  FAN NOISE IS SO ANNOYING.  I do like the keyboard and form factor, but so far I'm quite disappointed.UPDATE:  I deleted and reinstalled the OS.  It took some time, but the battery life much better and the fan only comes on once in a while.  (note don't just reinstall OS: delete the old one, and reinstall) Now, it works like a normal Mac.  But....I'm still wary.",3,1,2020-6-4,1,9,0

"It's a very simple laptop for someone like me! I'm tech savvy enough to get around and use some special features, but I also lack the ability that some have for a more in depth PC experience.My only complaint it that the actual dimensions were more like 12"", so I think I may have to spend more money on apples website to get a case.",4,1,2020-5-8,1,4,0

"After ten years of wanting a MacBook but never ""needing"" one, I finally decided to bite the bullet and treat myself. I am SO glad that I did. It's such a rich and smooth experience that can't be described unless you see for yourself. The keys are like butter. The display is incredible. The touch-ID is super convenient. It's as light as a feather. And I love how my MacBook ""communicates"" with my iPhone and Apple Watch.I was worried that I'd have a tough time figuring out how to navigate the operating system because I'm not very tech-savvy, but within a few hours I figured everything out just fine. I will NEVER settle for Windows again. Like my headline says, ""Once you go Mac, you never go back."" Lol",5,1,2020-6-21,1,1,0
"First thing I like was that it is very light weight yet, it is very durable and not cheaply made.  I have been searching for the right Macbook at the right specs and the right price.  This Mac has given me all that.  I have 512 GB of HDD space.It has a SSD for a fast boot up.  Even the reboot is quick.",5,1,2020-9-11,1,2,0
"I'm not gonna lie, I was kind of worried when I ordered this. But it turns out that there is no reason to be worried at all. This macbook is the same that apple would send you themselves, just with faster delivery.",5,1,2020-3-31,1,6,0
"To start off, the MacBook booted up quickly and the set up was easy. The camera sucks but that isn’t what I need the MacBook for, I needed it for online college courses and it seems like it will hold up well for that. Very light weight laptop which is amazing. The battery life seems to be good. I received the MacBook yesterday and so far so good. I will try to give an update after a month or so again. I would recommend this computer to others!!",4,1,2020-6-21,1,3,0
This was my final Apple purchase to complete my “collection” if you will. I’ve wanted this MacBook Air for SOOO long and Apple did not disappoint! It is such a beautiful design and extremely user friendly. It’s my first Mac and I was able to turn it on and start using it right away. My favorite feature so far is handoff and how well it syncs with all my other Apple products.,5,1,2020-4-28,1,4,0
"I purchased my last Macbook in 2014 and used it constantly for work and personal business.  It's only failure was that the keyboard gave out two years ago when individual keys began falling out.  Solution?  An Apple bluetooth keyboard which fit perfectly over the built-in one.  That Mac is still working great (and is now my backup one) but I finally decided to upgrade.  The 2020 model is modestly better than my old one - faster, crisper screen images, fingerprint login, etc.  But with Apple having already set the bar so high, it's difficult for Macbooks to get tremendously better.  Macs offer amazing security and a reliable, durable, long lasting laptop that will last years and years - an amazing return on one's investment.  Some say Apple devices are no longer ""exciting"".  Who knows?  For me, exciting means amazing quality that lasts and lasts.",5,1,2020-8-28,1,1,0
I just got mine in the mail today it was supposed to come yesterday but it wasn't amazons fault it was ups but overall I am happy its so lite and I love the keybord the only thing I dislike is that it only has 2 ports on the side but I'm going to order the connecters today so I can plug my speakers and other things up overall its worth the money and def get apple care because you never know what could happen I'm so excited I have all apple products my last Mac that I got was in 2015 Apple did a great job with this Mac air,5,1,2020-6-13,1,3,0
"This was my first time using a MAC product--and I admit--I had to get used to the system. But once that was done, this laptop is beautiful in form and feature. High quality screen, and fast! I was concerned with being able to download apps I use. However, with the correct downloading procedures, my fears were unfounded. Unfortunately, the camera is grainy and dull, which is odd in light of the top quality of this device. It's too bad Apple cannot enhance the MacBook Air's camera quality to match the high quality cameras found on their iPads, and iPhones. Go figure.",4,1,2020-5-26,1,2,0
"Apple is supposed to be easy.  All I want to do is download a few CDs into iTunes. DVD drives don't work so I bought an expensive Apple drive that doesn't fit, so I bought a adapted. Now it says accessory USB needs power. On-line support is not helpful.Downloading files for my 3D printer was a pain too. I had to use 3ed party software and go through loopholes ever time.",2,1,2020-9-3,1,3,1
"I love this thing! I bought it for my work and am very happy with it. I paid extra for more storage space, but I had some issues getting things transferred from my iPhone and iPad to the MacBook. I would move things over and delete them from other devices and they would be deleted completely from the laptop as well (which defeated the purpose of having extra storage space and clearing out my cloud). I just turned off the iCloud and airdropped. So I suppose it was just my personal user tech problem. Maybe other people are more tech savvy. But anyway, all and all, I am so happy with this. Great purchase!!",5,1,2020-6-29,1,2,0

"Just received two days ago and it is working great for me. Responsive and fast compared to my HP. No issues setting it up and it is just what I hoped it would be. So far so good. The speakers are amazing. I was skeptical after reading some of the negative reviews, but I saw a few glowing ones and crossed my fingers I would get one like them. I have heard no whirring sound from it. And no more heat than any other laptop I have had, actually less heat than the last Dell I had. I will be keeping it.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,2,0
"This is the 5th MacBook I've owned over the years & by far the best one yet! It's quite a bit smaller than the original 13"" MacBook Air & has been a pure joy to use. I have no complaints at all.",5,1,2020-4-19,1,4,0
"The laptop is absolutely weightless yet solid. Screen and optics is crystal clear and pleasant on the eye. The sound is extremely pleasing and clear, keys are just right, not too sensitive or hard to press. Battery seems to last for quite some time off of charger, not sure if it will last ten hours as advertised, but it sits idle for long periods and during use not requiring a charger cord. Online support has been helpful, not a ton of advertisements or purchases for programs as windows HP traditionally uses. Now, must get use to using Mac from using Windows for years. overall, I enjoy this MacBook Air, cost a pretty penny but if it helps for work, it'll be worth the price. Thank you",5,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0

I did a lot of research regarding the new MacBook Pro 13"" and the MacBook Air 2020.  For my needs this is perfect.I don't get into a lot of photo editing or graphics would likely require the Pro model 13"" for starters and then it just goes up from there.",5,1,2020-9-6,1,1,0

Product came in GREAT condition. Only problem I have is when I put my phone by the screen, the screen glitches. Idk if thats just me or if that happens to everyone. The laptop barely overheats. Actually, the laptop never really gets hot. I love this laptop. Keyboard is great! Easy to type and use.

"Bought this to use for online teaching. Very easy to setup and sync to my Mac to get the data and apps from it. Some have complained about the camera. I do notice that the video quality when you start FaceTime can be grainy for some reasons, but it resolves after a few seconds. Highly recommend. (Note to Amazon:  when you offer a lower price within 1-2 days of a customer receiving their order, just give them the difference back to their form of payment. Making me erase my personal data and ship back the first one is a waste of time and money.)",5,1,2020-4-25,1,1,0
"I am a first time Apple user. I got an iPhone recently and then I got my Macbook. I always wanted one of the two (but mostly the MacBook because of college). I LOVE IT. The screen is amazingly clear and the keyboard is soooo smooth. I had an HP before and remembered that the keyboard was way too hard. I love how fast the processor is and how organized everything is. I also love the fact that everything is synced with my other devices. It arrived in IMPECCABLE condition. The ONLY problem I had was with UPS. They NEVER find my house in Puerto Rico (and I live near the city). Their delivery service is getting REALLY BAD. Fix this! Other than that, a very good laptop!",4,1,2020-5-31,1,2,0
But this one dont buy the old ones.The very own boring “magic keyboard” (implemented and marketed as “new feature”) is a deal breaker itself since it uses a reliable standard scissor-switch mechanism plus the rest specs will do the works (dont expect high performance with the i3 though) plus since it runs macOs (proprietary software) you have wider range of os’s options able to run windows an linux if you want to,3,1,2020-4-25,1,4,0

Just made the transition to buying apple products and this is my first Apple MacBook and I must say I am truly impressed. Recently began graduate school and needed a better laptop so I was advice to purchase a MacBook. I was advice to purchase a MacBook Pro but decided to go with the Air just because it was more affordable. At the moment I believe it was the best choice. It’s easy to transition from one application to the next. Setup was simple but it is different from the other computers so you’ll have to sit down and toy with it. Wish the camera was a little better but I’m not going to complain about that. Overall good investment for the next 2 years.,5,1,2020-7-7,1,2,0

Love it bought it to work from home and it works great! It works really good no lagging and I use a very complicated work application and i have had no issues! Impressed best laptop I have ever had! Only downside is battery life my work application drains the battery so I have to charge up several times throughout the day but that my only complaint is the battery could be a bit better!,5,1,2020-5-27,1,3,0

"I'm very much a simple minded guy, especially when it comes to computers, but when my old one died, I researched for a new one and the MacBook air always had great reviews. Then the new model came out on discount so I took a chance. Glad I did! It was super easy to set up and use: and I never used a Mac before. I am looking forward to years of satisfaction with such an efficient, user friendly, and reliable product!",5,1,2020-4-3,1,3,0

This is a great computer especially for being used and not the newest gen. It has minor problems like it would glitch our when I would open my google drive and that was pretty much my purpose for buying this computer but there are other ways to get around it.  The battery life actually lasts longer than expected but it goes semi fast once its below 50%.  I was a little disappointed with the camera quality but its not too bad. The mic works well so far. I am really impressed tbh!!,4,1,2020-9-5,1,2,0
"I want to first start by addressing the one star for fingerprint; that is only due to the fact that I did not use it yet. Otherwise, this Retina display has helped a lot with my eyesight! I worked in an office setting and it was not very easy on my eyes. Also, this has so far been the best laptop I can purchase when producing music or just for everyday convenience. Not the mention, the color is awesome! If I left something out, that is a mistake. Overall, great price and great purchase!",5,1,2020-7-7,1,1,0
I bought this laptop several months ago and still haven't figured it out. I haven't been able to use it. I had a Apple computer at one time and I loved it. So I thought I would get a Apple laptop.

My Lenovo X1 Carbon finally bit the dust.  I was a little hesitant to switch to Mac but this laptop is eassy to use and performs great.  Best of all i was able to install windows 10 via Boot Camp Assistant (included) and was able to register it with my old Lenovo registration.  So basically i have a Mac and windows laptop for the same price!,5,1,2020-7-11,1,1,0
I ordered this item since I was working from home/ taking classes online due to COVID19. The computer is greater but I have two complaints:1. I've charged the computer 10 times so far since my purchase and the battery dropped from 100% to 99% of its capacity. Seems weird to me that it's happening so quickly.,5,1,2020-7-10,1,2,0
Really happy with this purchase! Never owned a MacBook in the past and I love it. Takes time to get used to some functions but I don't plan on going back to windows. I am told that these things last forever so I am hoping that lives up to the saying. Greatest investment ever!,5,1,2020-7-9,1,2,0

I made the mistake of ordering this laptop on line and then I tired to get in to a store to get help in transferring my data from my old computer to my new computer.

I would not recommend purchasing this labtop. I purchased this recently and my goodness the camera is horrible. My mom uses this and she said the camera looked like it was made in the 1990s. Worst camera I have seen from an apple product. Now I don't know if its just this particular model or if its just amazon that was bad but I definitely will be susceptible on future more expensive products of popular brands like apple. This was used primarily for zoom meetings and I can say the Ipad is way more advanced then this laptop.,2,1,2020-9-2,1,1,0
"..not my last. What took me so long? All my portables are Apple and have not owned a Mac till now.I bought a new PC at the same time, and I keep coming back to the Mac. I love the keyboard..as a matter of fact I am in search of a similar keyboard for the PC.",5,1,2020-5-30,1,1,0

I read things about noise and overheating but not with this one.  Works great excellent display processor works fast on code projects I've been doing.  I don't use the camera feature that much so can't comment on that  I import images if needed.  I would definitely recommend .  I have a surface as well and use them in tandem for programming classes.,5,1,2020-6-14,1,1,0
"I just purchased this laptop last Thursday. I am overall please with my purchase. I’ve read the reviews before purchasing it and and just like everyone said the camera quality is HORRIBLE, hence why I’m giving it 4 stars, It’s extremely grainy, so do not have high hopes for using the camera.

Then it forgot my fingerprint, so I had to reset that. This is not a good omen.",2,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"Got this to replace a 2012 MacBook Air that we handed down to our son.

They would not replace the defective unit. The key board would not work on a new unit. I have to return the defective unit and purchase a new one. My college student can not be without a computer.

Mac Screens break too easily. This is the second one I’ve had in about two years and I can’t seem to catch a break.

"I wanted to try macOS out because I need to be versatile in the both operating systems and my gaming laptop motherboard went out. I wanted the pro, but got this. The pros of this laptop is def the battery life, I love the trackpad, the keyboard has grown on me, the screen resolution is nice, and it looks great, However with pros comes cons, and this laptop is very underpowered but I already knew that, it gets hot from having multiple tabs open and in zoom meetings, its running on a 9w processor. macOS file management is not good at all compared to windows, I can't use Microsoft access on this machine because its windows only, so as you may know there are compatibility issues. Overall however this is not a bad machine, it is a joy to do my lighter tasked school work on, if you are looking for one over a windows laptop, it all depends on what you are doing, personally I would not pick this over a Windows laptop due to compatibly issues, not being able to upgrade the hardware, and being that file management is terrible, however, I can see myself with both Operating systems.

"I purchased a Macbook Air in November 2019 at an Apple store. Leaving a review here because you can't leave customer reviews on the Apple website (convenient, right?).Around April 2020, so 5 months into owning my MacBook, the computer started shutting down unexpectedly. After this occurred off and on for a couple weeks, it shut down and wouldn't restart. I could sometimes get to the login screen, but ultimately it would shut down again before I could log in. I called Apple support, and a rep walked me through the process of reinstalling Catalina. This worked for a few weeks, but then I had the same problem. This time I couldn't even get to the login screen. Again, called Apple. Again, a rep tried to walk me through the process of reinstalling Catalina. In the middle of this process, the computer spontaneously started working again. This only lasted a week or two. Last week, the computer completely stopped working. Press the power button, it displays the apple logo, the screen flashes, it shuts off. Apple connected me with an authorized service provider who ran diagnostics, couldn't identify the source of the problem, and out of an abundance of caution/wanting to ensure they fixed it, they replaced the logic board. I returned home and attempted to go through the setup process as if it is a new computer. It shuts off again. Same problem all over again. I call Apple. I explain to them that this product is clearly a bad product and I need it replaced. I have take great care of it. I'm a very basic user - I am in grad school. All I use it for is imessage, Amazon, and schoolwork. I do NOT have time to continue dealing with this in the middle of an accelerated graduate program, especially while my campus is shut down due to this pandemic so I don't have access to computers on campus while this is ""repaired"". I ask that they acknowledge that they sold me a bad product and allow me to receive a replacement. They refuse. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE POLICIES. So now the computer is back in the repair shop. Again. I am stuck trying to share my husband's PC while he is working from home as I wait yet again for this very expensive and very new computer to be fixed.",1,0,2020-7-8,1,4,0

"Long review BUT worth the read...After looking at numerous reviews about the MBA 2020 and the MBP 2020...I decided on the MBA and I'm so glad I did!!! I had an early-release MBA 2010 which I loved (...and lasted perfectly until 2016 despite having a cracked plastic hard-shell, it was the base model too)...I decided to pick-up a MBP 2015 which was great at the time due to me doing a lot of video editing because my old MBA could do it BUT it took forever. My MBP 2015 still works fine BUT occasionally experience glitches and I realized it would be smart to get another Macbook especially since I'm working from home everyday during these covid-19 times.",5,0,2020-7-16,1,5,0
"I have owned iPods & iPads over the years but never had the money to purchase a Mac until now. I am so glad I did. This was a big purchase for me, I have never spent more than $300 on a laptop, I don't even own a RTX 2080 in my gaming PC. I work in IT and I felt not knowing much about Mac OS was sort of hindering me, so I just decided to spend the money and get myself a Mac to get acquainted with the operating system. I went with the base version (i3, 8GB RAM) and so far I have not noticed anything wrong with the performance. I am not a power user as far as editing video / photos by no means, but I'm sure this MacBook can handle it without an issue. My tasks include web browsing, email, music, electronic banking, and working on documents amongst a few other basic tasks. At first I felt like throwing down $900 on a MacBook just for these tasks was going to be a waste and a big time impulse buy, but I feel it will definitely come in handy. The color is amazing, I am so used to seeing the typical silver MacBook, but space gray is the best option IMO. It's super lightweight, the retina display is crisp & beautiful, the battery lasts a very long time, speakers are loud and clear, and the keyboard just feels so nice! The trackpad is really nice too with its many useful gestures. It does get slightly warm during extended use but that's to be expected since there's no vents for ventilation. I wish it had more IO like at least one USB A port, but nothing a hub can't fix. Also, I wish the components were upgradable like the RAM & SSD. 8GB RAM is definitely enough more than enough for basic day to day tasks. MacOS is super easy to navigate and everything just works. I will admit it takes a few more steps to get software installed, the OS is very restricted and requires admin privileges for almost anything, but it makes me feel secure. Touch ID is very nice and works flawlessly. I did install trend micro and Malwarebytes for security just to give myself some insurance on being secure. Having used Windows for many years, there are a few things that I need to remember works differently on Mac. All in all, a really great purchase, Apple definitely knocks out of the ballpark when it comes to quality, everything looks and feels premium.",5,0,2020-7-29,1,2,0
"2020 Macbook Refresh with a lower starting price and the new scissor switch keyboard that replaces apple's old butterfly keyboards that had many issues. Works great for every day tasks. It will overheat when given CPU heavy tasks such as video rendering, music production, and photo editing",4,0,2020-5-3,1,5,0
"I bought mine on another website because Amazon didn't offer the configuration I wanted, which was 1.1 GHz 10th-generation i5 with 16 GB of RAM.  This laptop is absolutely beautiful.  The keyboard is fantastic improvement (I have a 12"" Macbook with the butterfly keys, and it's a horrible design with no key travel).  The Retina screen is gorgeous.  It's quick and responsive, and I love the new touch login button.  Like most Apple products, build quality is stellar.However, it runs quite warm.  Installed an app called ""Monity"" which shows CPU temperature among other sensor information.  It's not uncommon for the CPU in this version under normal browsing - not a heavy load - to run between 160 and 185F, which is 85C.  Much warmer - 20 or 30 degrees - than the 2.7 GHz i5 in my 2015 Macbook Pro sitting right next to it with similar use.  The numbers alone are one thing, but this laptop is uncomfortable to surf with while on in your lap. You can feel the heat emanating from the bottom under light use.  There are lots of forums with debates as to whether the i3 might be a better choice as some users say it runs cooler, which makes sense as it only has two cores and draws less power, though I haven't experienced it.  The i5 seems like a good performer, but this Macbook Air is noticeably warmer - uncomfortably so -  than the 2017 and earlier design of Air that I used to have.  Operating it on a surface, though, and not your lap is fine.  I have read that the new design does not have a a heat pipe from the CPU to the cooling fan, which seems like a strange change.",4,0,2020-6-21,1,0,0
"My unit became hot (uncomfortably) and the fan went crazy just in set up. Casual internet use caused the same. Just do a google search about this issue before you buy. Apple did not connect the heat sink to the fan, (probably knowingly)",2,0,2020-6-6,1,3,0
"It's probably my 6th or 7th Macbook and I had my other iMacs and Mac Minis, so I'm very used to the behavior of the fans used by Apple. In this 2020 Macbook Air it's completely unacceptable. With light usage, web browsing, and emails, the fans if always at the max speed, around 8000 RPM. Very loud. Air-conditioned environment. No external accessories. No heavy software. I called them several times informing that A LOT of people are complaining about the same issue and they say that I have to send the machine. I'm working from home and I can't send it and wait for a week.  It's a clear design problem of the cooling system. It's loud and the lifespan of the fan will be short, of course, since it's always running at the highest speed.  I'm really disappointed with Apple.I bought it in June, so I can't return it. I can't even trade in the machine on the Apple website since they accept only 2019 models, no 2020 option. I don't know what to do.",1,0,2020-8-24,1,0,1
"Hi I’ve Found out I’m an iPad only user. I recently purchased a MacBook Air and found out quickly it wasn’t for me, I spend so much  time with my iPad Air (older version) I just couldn’t acclimate to a notebook computer I found it heavy with sharp edges that’s just not suited for someone that spends time on their back, I did  find the trackpad easy to use, and liked typing on a keyboard. The number of times I found myself reaching for the touchscreen was crazy and decided  within a few days I better return it to Apple, this is just a matter of personal preference. I do want to mention the heating thing, if you look at any video of the  internals the fan has no affect on the CPU. I could hear the fan kick on, with the bottom case becoming very warm, the gen10 processor also us 30% less energy than the gen8.  Apple isn’t always perfect in design. A lot of money to contribute to the CCP.",3,0,2020-7-27,1,1,0
"We have a litany of Apple products around the house, including the 2020 MBA. With product knowledge and real life user experience, i'd recommend looking into this year's MBP instead. Without even opening up final cut pro or lightroom, this machine will heat up and the fan noise is distracting. I expect to comfortably run multiple browser tabs, jump on a zoom call, while presenting a slide deck, to not worry about unwarranted noise pollution from the fan. These are my baseline applications so YMMV. This is a hardware design issue. The heat sink is not connected to the fan and thus ceaseless noise and furthermore, a hot computer. Also, 2/5 camera quality due to 720p. Keyboard 5/5.",2,0,2020-6-23,1,2,0
I like nothing. It lacks basic connectors. A portablecomputer should not require loose expnansion module to connect to normal usb video devices but this does. `Th3e case is made of soft metal which is easily damaged. The usb connector fits rght into the power port and one mistake burned out an external displsy. The builtin display is trash and replacement is expensive. This was not a design failure. It wdone tomake it easy to break. Then hard to repair. Avoid,1,0,2020-8-5,1,1,0
"This is the first Apple product that I have purchased that I don't like. I love my old Macbook Air from 2013. At the time, it was light and slick and fast. Fast forward 7 years and the MacBook Air is the cheap the version of the Macbook Pro. It's barely lighter, and it's almost as powerful, but it isn't.I missed the 14-day window, but I want to return this for 2 reasons:",2,0,2020-6-22,1,4,0
"I bought this and immediate wanted to return because of bad camera quality. The 720p FaceTime HD camera is worse than my Macbook Air 2015. I returned it and got refund, however, they charged me $180 restocking fee. I am not happy about it at all.",1,0,2020-7-12,1,1,0
"This is my first MacBook and have used windows computers for a long time. This has been the best purchase I have made. I see many bad reviews for those who use a lot of CPU but not many of those who buy a computer who just use computers to reply to e-mails, create docs on word, excel, etc. and/or surf the web. Most of my online business relies on internet connection and basic tools like the ones mentioned. I do not need a lot of CPU power. This computer is extremely quick for what I need it for. Computer performs extremely well and best of all, it is a great inexpensive MacBook. Since it is the air, It is also VERY LIGHT. I've had a lot of computers that are HEAVY and cumbersome to carry around. You won't even realize this is in your bag! If you need a lot more computing power, this might not be the computer for you. But if you are the average student, just someone who browses the web, or your business relies solely on replying to emails and the occasional word doc or excel and occasional zoom call, this is the PERFECT computer for you. The only con is I wish the battery life was a little longer. Although I've spent a lot of time at home so that also doesn't pose an issue. 5 stars anyway because I know what I got into when purchasing. The camera also is just a very standard camera. Perfect for the occasional zoom call. This is really the best intro online business/student computer. If you are debating, debate no more. The new May 2020 MacBook Air was just upgraded to 256GB as a standard and more computing power. This is the right move.",5,0,2020-7-10,1,0,0

"Do you like a laptop that gets very hot after you purchased it for $1000? Do you like a laptop that has a very loud and noisy fan, after you have paid $1000 for it? If that is the case, this is a great laptop for you. After two days, I returned mine to Apple and got back my $1000. I used to have the 11""6, bought it 2014, it had no issues like this.",2,0,2020-7-27,1,0,0

This is an excellent MacBook Air because I bought it as Amazon used but I don’t think It was ever used. There were no dents or scratches and clean overall. The battery life is excellent but what I like more is the finger touch. It is very convenient for easy login and making quick purchase. This MacBook Air is very reliable for school and work.,5,1,2020-9-7,1,0,1

Absolutely perfect!!!! The only thing is you’d think Apple would include an adapter of some sort (Like they do for the iPhones) since there’s no USB ports or anything. But other than that the computer works perfectly. 100% Legit!!,5,0,2020-4-30,1,0,0
