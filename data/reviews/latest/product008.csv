"A steal. For the price and quality, you get with this purchase you cant go wrong. You get the mount (obviously) a pretty decent HDMI cord and a little level. It was super easy to assemble.The amount of screws and wedges that come with will be a little overwhelming but once you find the right screw you're golden.",5,1,2017-9-25,1,3,1
I looked at many different wall mounts and was unsure which to buy. Wall mounts for Samsung TV's are a little more challenging because many do not come with compatible bolts. This mount does comes with bolts compatible for a series of different manufacturers including Samsung and the 8000 Series 65in 2018 model. That saved me a trip to the local hardware store. Because the back of the TV is curved I had to fiddle with the brackets to make sure they were snug and secure them with some long spacers that came with the TV and a couple thin spacers that come with the mount. Securing the brackets was the most challenging part but really not that bad. Just take your time and make sure you do it right. Securing the mount to the wall is pretty easy once you get it level. A drill and a socket set and you are good to go. Once it is in a couple studs it is very secure and that TV is not going anywhere. I also paired this mount with the PowerBridge ONE-CK Recessed In-Wall Cable Management System to hide the wires which also works great. Very happy with this mount and would buy again.,5,1,2018-9-14,1,1,1
"This wall mount is extremely strong and able to support my new Samsung 55"" flat screen. I was able to screw the mount into two wall studs top and bottom, ensuring this is mounted to the wall safely and w/o any concern of it coming loose. The tilt option and the quick release pull downs are easy to use. The quick release is a great safety assurance that no one is able to accidently lift the bottom of the TV away from the wall. But should you need to do so, each release is quickly accessed by hand and because the TV is a 55"" unit, it hides the release pull down ribbons very well. You'll want to use a ""real"" level and not the 1"" bubble level that comes with the wall mount.Installing it was very easy, all (and more) of the screws, washers, connectors came in the package, so no need to have to run out to the hardware store due to missing parts. Instructions were written very well and easy to follow.",5,1,2016-10-11,1,1,0
"I was skeptical when I opened the box but this is a very sturdy mount. It easily handles the weight of my 75"" Sony. A couple tips...  it comes in two pieces. When assembling, make sure to push both sides together so they are both lined up a perfectly horizontal. When adjusting the tilt mechanism, you'll want to use something as a gauge so both sides are tilted exactly the same. Mounting the wall mount is easy, but make sure to use a stud finder to locate the center of the studs so the lag bolts can grip securely. There's a little room for vertical play in the mounting slots so you'll be able to fine tune the leveling to some extent. You'll also be able to slide your TV left and right a little to get it centered.BTW, the package include an HDMI cable and a level. I personally wouldn't trust either.",5,1,2018-1-3,1,7,0
"Overall, I would probably honestly get this again.  The price is great, and its well made despite its shortcomings, and comes with good extras (level, HDMI cable). I would not recommend this if your audio/video out plugs are near the bottom of your TV.  Getting the frame on the wall was easy, and so was attacking the braces to the TV.  Everything is very straightforward, instructions are easy, and had plenty of hardware.  The tough parts:1) even using the spacers provided, the TV is ""holy crap"" close to the wall (to be fair, it is advertised this way).  It seems nice, but the issue is that it doesn't even leave enough room for the plugs.  Power, HDMI, component, they all hit the wall.  This makes tilting the TV difficult if they are on the bottom end of the unit, because they will hit the wall and prevent you from being able to tilt it fully.  It also makes it difficult to lock in the bottom hooks, because you need to jam the TV into the wall and feel like you will break it, and there's a good chance the cords will get in the way.",4,1,2017-7-1,1,7,0
"Very happy with the quality and build of this unit.  Used it to mount my 65 inch TV... feels secure and the straps aren't visible with such a large TV.  I would not recommend relying on the level included with the kit.... mine read off and I had to re-drill and adjust using my quality level... but once up, its up and it ain't coming down.  Funny that brick and mortar stores charge 2 to 3 times the price for a unit like this.  Thank you Mounting Dream, and Thank You Amazon... Hey, remember when you just basically sold books... I do; oh how far we've come.",5,1,2018-1-15,1,5,0
"Admittedly I was skeptical of this mount.  I have two mounts of another more expressive brand that were both installed by a professional.  The other brand cost $150.00 each and supports up 150 lbs.  This significantly cheaper Mounting Dream mount features the same specs and performs just as well.  This mount is very sturdy and offers quick disconnect pull straps to easily remove the TV from the mount if needed.Attaching this mount to the wall was very easy with the aid of the included leveler.  Make sure to find the studs in the wall with a stud finder.  For additional peace of mind, use a magnetic stud finder in addition to the traditional one to locate the nails in the studs.  There is nothing worse than discovering a metal nail in a spot where you need to screw in your last bolt.",5,1,2017-8-1,1,5,1
"I bought this to hang a 37"" Vizio TV on the wall. I'm pretty satisfied with it. Lots of flexibility with spacers, holes, and bolts. Seems plenty sturdy for my set.The only slight ""gotcha"" to be aware of is if you try to set the tilt angle before hanging it on the wall, the latches on the bottom will not engage. It has to be almost completely straight vertical before they will clear the bottom rail and properly lock in place. You can tilt it after its hanging on the wall though. The trick is to tighten the bolts to where they are just tight enough to keep it from moving by itself, but not to tight to prevent movement with a firm pull.",4,1,2018-4-4,1,3,0
This is a very cheaply made product. If you do buy it purchase your own screws for the tv because now I have a tv with 3 broken off screws in the back of it and can no longer be mounted to the wall.... fyi... one screw broke while attaching it to the tv....and the other 2 broke while trying to take them out of the tv. I got screwed by the screws....,1,1,2018-6-1,1,2,0
"Decent mount for the price. I actually like the simplicity of the packaging. Before I review, I would like to share that if you are intimidated of doing this yourself, don’t be. Acquire a good stud finder, take measurements and order the appropriate mount for your television. This particular mount is for studs 16” apart. This is not always the case in homes. Verify before you buy!!!Pros:",4,1,2018-12-4,1,1,0
"We have a spare 32"" TV that's been sitting around and decided to put this in the guest room.  I've installed number of TV's and familiar with proper install including routing the wires behind the dry wall but for this install I opted not to do so.You will either need a stud finder if not a good magnet that has 60 lb pull or more.  IMO the magnet is far more accurate and easy to find studs as often times either you'll see a drywall with ever so slight dimple from the drywall screw.  It'll be either 16"" or 24"" apart to the center of the stud (goes vertical if you're not familiar with the studs).",5,1,2018-9-16,1,2,1
"Super easy to install and results in an extremely sturdy TV mount. My use case was as easy as it could be with 16"" studs but it still would have been pretty easy to get this installed for irregular spacing...they even include instructions with several different options.The TV feels extremely safe and secure and yet it's still super easy to pull the TV down off the wall as well when necessary. The 8 degree downward tilt is perfect as well. I've mounted a TV for a home gym so a slight downward tilt is perfect to accommodate viewing from the floor.",5,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"Not the fault of the product, but the wall I needed to mount to is apparently built up as a facade over a structural wall (something I also didn't know) and has 25"" stud spacing which the corners of this mount couldn't reach; even for normal walls with 16"" studs or ""partition"" walls with 24"" studs, having the wall plate be 30-32"" wide would give a lot more flexibility for the installation positioning.I was able to get plenty of strenght using the provided bolts to lag into a stud near the middle along with four heavy-duty drywall toggles at the corners (the toggles alone may have been sufficient, but I don't entirely trust them in that much unsupported drywall.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"This is a solid TV mount. We originally bought this big beefy one that had full range of motion for a large tv but decided we did not need all that so we sent back that $200 mount for this much much cheaper one and it does its job great. I was shocked how much lighter and less material there was than the other one but I am fully confident in this mount. We have it above a fire insert in our house holding a 65"" Samsung. Bolts it comes with for the tv are great. It comes with a variety of spacers and washers and bolts to ensure it will fit your tv hole depth and the spacers allow you to mix and match to customize the mount fit to your tv. Works well, not worried about that tv at all. Range of motion is low but that is what it is designed to be, it can tilt some but we have it up on the wall so the natural down tilt angle it provides is perfect. We dont ever need to push it flat up against the wall so that is not needed. Given the metal was not wide enough to span three studs, we had to use a thin piece of wood to bolt to the studs and then bolt the mount to the wood but looks good, I trust it, super easy to set up. Once the base is mounted and the backs are on the tv, literally all you do is set it on the mount and it locks in. No more than two people needed, although three would be smart if you have anything bigger than 65"". GREAT MOUNT.",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"As I started assembling the mount I would have given it five stars. I was amazed - five or six different sizes of bolts to attach the bracket to the TV (instead of none like the last one I purchased), each of them with matching washers. About five lengths of spacers (more on this later) to hold the brackets away from the TV. All of the bolts needed to attach the rails to the wall. And the most amazing part of it, each one of them was clearly labeled.It went on the wall easily, and the brackets are easy to hook over the rails. The only thing I could ask would be for the rails to be a couple of inches longer. There is a stud 1/2"" away from where the TV should be centered, and once the rails were offset enough to reach the next stud, it was just barely long enough on the other side to reach the bracket.",4,1,2019-1-27,1,2,0
"I ordered this for my 50” Panasonic plasma and it is too small - it is not wide enough for the mounting holes on the tv. The max on the mount is 24” wide and the TV has holes 26” apart.I ordered this figuring that with a 70” maximum, I’d have no issues with my 50” TV. I was wrong!",1,1,2019-10-30,1,2,0
"I used to work as a technician installing home entertainment systems in high end homes, so I have worked on quite a few TV mounts, I also know I didn't need all the bells and whistles, just a basic mount for my living room.The mount arrived and is very straight forward, two brackets on the back of the TV and one plate on the wall. Using the provided lag bolts I was able to install the plate onto the wall with ease, although, WARNING, as you should probably expect, the provided levels IS NOT LEVEL. That isn't really an issue with the mount itself, just a forewarning.",4,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"I've professionally mounted a lot of TV's, used a lot of high end mounts.  This is probably the cheapest one.  The mounting hardware was pretty standard, what you get with every mount kit (I have saved all of it just because it's nothing sold in stores so I have spares from my countless installs).The torpedo level was pure junk, but I use a $40 Milwaukee one and other tools of the trade.",2,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"Although I prefer one piece mounts to one's that have to be assembled such as these, these worked great to mount 3 flat panel TVs in my new home. Leveling them can be a bit of a chore due to the center connector of the 2 piece mount giving such a short span to reference. You have to be careful when assembling the 2 piece wall bracket to ensure the center support and each side piece are in the same ""plane"" when referenced from the top. Once that is done though the rest of install is a breeze. I also recommend if only one stud is being used to secure it in other holes using better dry wall anchors than the ones supplied. I got lucky on 2 of the 3 mounts and was able to get it secured to 2 studs. On the third I used large toggle style drywall anchors that engage a large area on the back of the drywall. All in all I am happy with the mounts.",4,1,2017-9-11,1,4,0
"This is the fifth and largest (put up a 75"" in the back of our church this time) TV I've put up using a Mounting Dream brand mount, and I am 100% thrilled with the quality and ease of install EACH AND EVERY TIME.  This puppy comes with every type of screw, spacer, and washer you could need. I've mounted 2 Sonys, a Toshiba, and 2 TCLs, and have never needed to buy another piece or part.  This time, I was drilling into concrete so I DID need to buy anchors, but I knew that going in, and wouldn't expect a company to include concrete anchors with every mount when only a very few people would use them.Everything feels strong and secure.  The guy who helped me put this one up (I can handle a 55"" and down by myself, but a 75's is too dang big for one dude!) was even impressed with the mount, and then he was REALLY impressed when I told how inexpensive it was.  There is ZERO reason to spend $80-$130 on a mount at the big box stores.  I GUARANTEE YOU they are no better than the Mounting Dream options.",5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
"The bracket that mounts on the wall comes in two pieces (only reason for that seems to be so that they can fit it in a smaller box). 4 screws are supposed to attach one half to the other, but they are too big for the holes. Spent 40 minutes trying to figure it out, then unscrewed one of the screws that was already in the bracket (from the factory). It was too big too, but they appear to have hammered it in (threads were bent flat except for the last 2). Replicating that technique didn't really work (they went in, but were loose and fell out), but I put it up anyway. It mostly works, but my tv is now a little crooked on the wall as a result. How this thing got so many good reviews is beyond me.",1,1,2020-2-9,1,2,0
"Wow, amazing product for the price! First thing I was impressed with was how heavy the boxes were! (I ordered 3). The packaging was organized and the instructions were very clear. Great little additions like a template and a level are included. I'm glad I went with this brand because there were way too many options. The review rating made the difference.MEASURE YOUR STUDS BEFORE ORDERING!!",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"Are you tired of spending $2800 on a wall mount that will give you the same quality as this $27 one? Well look no further and consider the Mounting Dream tv wall mount! Designed for both drywall and concrete installation, with a little bit of patience and planning, this will take your large TV and free up a ton of space versus keeping it on a tv stand.Unboxing? It was a small headache until I actually read the pamphlet. Every item included is categorized together and referenced in the manual for ease of assembling. Give a medal to whoever put this instruction manual together.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,1
"I have installed dozens of TV mounts, this the mounting system was easy to put together and easy to install.  The only issue I had was the limited type of screws included.  Other systems which I’ve used have long and short screws of various diameters.  This kit only included one of each diameter which forced me to use several spaces to utilize.  This caused the TV to be farther off the wall than I wanted.  But it still works.  The included HDMI cable is nice but too short to be practical for most installation which put the wires thru the wall.",4,1,2020-8-2,1,1,0
My wife ordered this for an older (heavier) 70” flat screen. I assumed that it would need to be returned snd a real mount ordered as it was 20% the regular price point for such mounts.  Was I ever wrong.  I am hard to please. I would rather go without than to own junk and modern manufacturing leaves a lot to be desired.  Not this mount.  Heavy gauge metal.  Basically every screw you might need for every major brand individually sealed and labeled?!? Plastic grommets and washers to improve stability depending on style of TV.... also separated and labeled!!??  Instructions were simple and properly labeled with good illustrations!  I cannot believe they did this for under $30.  It is manufactured with a higher quality and better organization that anything I have purchased in a long time. Even came with Lag Bolts to mount into studs instead of undersized screws!  GET IT!!!! You will be impressed.,5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"Mounted a 70"" LCD in our workout room so that is at the high end of capacity for this unit. Easy to follow the instructions, kit was complete with all needed screws and spacers, even a HDMI cable and a small bubble level. Easy to hang the TV and holds just fine. The only thing that maybe a negative is the TV tends to lean out from the top a few degrees due to weight and the tilt feature. There may be some way to tighten that, but now that it is up, there is no room behind to poke around and I see nothing on that in the instructions. it's only couple degrees, so no issue for us. I recommend this one for a great value",5,1,2020-3-26,1,1,0
"Needed a product that allowed for an odd spaced studs. This was it. Materials are all metal, with thick stud screws. The attachments for the TV are easy to align and connect to the TV. the only drawback is that I could not adjust the tilt once the TV was place on the wall mount and that the tilt attachments wont lock on to the wall mount if it is pre-tilted. But I have had this on my wall for a month now and sturdy as can be.",4,1,2017-12-18,1,5,0
"My work used Mounting Dream mounts for half a dozen TV's last year and the property staff raved about them. When I needed to wall mount a TV at home I asked them for a recommendation. The weight rating for this mount is over double the weight of my TV, that's about where I like to be  for safety, anything worth doing is worth over doing. The hardest part of the install is locating the studs in the wall. After that it was smooth sailing. The kit includes a small level, once you get one corner bolt started, it's super easy to align the bracket and mark the remaining holes. It's a 2 piece system, the plate is bolted to the wall, the strips are screwed to the TV, lift the TV and hang it on the top of the plate, swing it down and the latches on the strips lock to the plate. There was plenty of various sized screws and spacers to attach the strips to the TV. If you don't need a swivel type mount, this is way to go.",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"This mount holds our 65” Vizio tv well. The tv is a few years old and heavy. My husband installed it above our fireplace and he said it was easy but he did have go to the store to get anchors since he was mounting it on brick. He, himself, even hung on the wall bracket to see how sturdy it was lol. Very pleased with how easy it was to install and how sturdy it is. Looks great!",5,1,2018-6-4,1,5,1
"If your studs are on 16"" centers then this should be fine.  If not, you'll need to buy an adapter kit to mount to the wall and then this will mount to the adapter.  I'm sure it stated that in the fine print on Amazon but I just looked at the weight and TV size it would support.  I happened to be mounting this TV in a bedroom on an interior wall that was shared with a closet and the stud spacing was wider than what this kit would support (I didn't realize that until it was time to mount the TV - which was a surprise Christmas present to my son).  Instead of trying to order the adapter kit, I went ahead and bought a wall mount kit locally that had wider rails and I was able to get it mounted ""in time"" so everything worked out.  I'm still giving this kit 4 stars because it looks like a good, solid kit and it came with an HDMI cable that I did end up using.  I'm sure I'll use this bracket at some point.",4,1,2018-1-23,1,1,0
Wall mount simple and good and comes with all screws (M4s/M6s and spacers). The screws to go in the studs of the wall for mounting are 2.5 inches long and could kill Mega-Dracula. Too big for my walls and and could only go in 1.5 inches. Luckily the spacers meant for the M4/M6 mounting screws on the TV brackets can be repurposed to the wall mounting screws and can ensure a snug fit on the wall. See the photos for help with the this off label use and jerry-rigging together. The giant screws stick out still but that is fine and doesn't interfere with the mounting in any way.,4,1,2020-8-30,1,1,1
"RECOMMEND: Use your own level and make sure you have a second set of hands to help put up the TV!I was very concerned about mounting a tv on my wall. I had never done it before and was worried it would fall right out. However, once I saw the mount first-hand those worries went away.",5,1,2019-11-26,1,1,1

"This was great when I first installed it. It was only 5 feet off ground, not much tilt needed. Then I needed to raise the tv highier, turns out this mounting unit does not clip into itself on the highier tilts. The locking mechanism doesn't catch. Piece of crap.",1,1,2018-12-17,1,1,0
"Very simple to install with full instructions and lots of different screw sizes and lengths to suit different TVs. We were mounting a 65"" Samsung UHDTV and it needed the longest M8 screws and additional washers and it fitted the highest and lowest holes on the brackets that go on the back of the TV. The spirit level that was included was not used as it was out of level when checked on a flat surface (just swing it through 180 and the bubble was not the same). The holes for the lag screws to hold it to the wall studs needed a 7/32"" drill and it still took a hex ratchet wrench and a strong arm to get them fully home. It was a good job that I connected the HDMI cables and the optical cable before mounting on the wall as they are almost inaccessible as the TV is very close to the wall. Two small release straps are provided for the bottom latches but they were just too short to be reached so we extended them by looping string through the straps. It was quite easy to tuck the excess string out of the way so nothing showed. The mounting bracket allows the TV to slide left and right for final positioning which helped as the studs were not in the best position between two large bookcases.Great praise for the well thought out unit and all of the fixings and great instructions.",5,1,2018-9-11,1,6,0
"I bought this to mount my 65 inch Samsung TV and it was a pretty easy installation.I only bought this and a magnetic stud finder (awesome by the way...) and drilled holes into the studs and then drilled the screws in using a socket adapter. Looks great on my wall -- my only complaint is that I don't think the level is that great, it shows it is level but you can tell it is about 1/2 inch off or less, not a big deal... Just have to figure out how to shift a little to make it better! (instructions show how). Also, not that easy to ""unscrew"" to tilt -- but still a great mount for the price, can't beat it!",5,1,2018-3-30,1,1,0

Completely changed the TV game. Viewing is so much pleasurable and in a small spaced apartments this is perfect. I wall mounted all my TVs and apartment looks clean and fresh. No nasty dust collecting tv stands with cables hanging all over. 5 min video on YouTube I'm a cable hiding expert. Process was a lot easier with my corded drill compared to battery powered drill. Once I finally figured that out install was a breeze. 1st install took 45 mins. Second and third install took less than 10 mins. Works well with my light weight newer 4K TVs and older model much heavier screen LCD panels. Material quality exceeded expectatios for the asking price. Great value.

Nice Hdmi cable included and a very nice low profile mounting solutions that doesn't stick out like half a foot like the mount i used for my living room.  Great for my bedroom setup.  HOWEVER.....I used the level included to install and it was level and after checking several times, keeps saying its level, but it is not, lol...I put the tv on the wall and laid in bed, and my eyes were having a different idea of what was level.  In the morning I checked again, and sure enough the crappy little level it came with says its level.  But I measured from the ceiling to the left and right ends of the tv, and boy it is not, so my eyes see level better then the level does, lol.  I think it is off by atleast a quater inch, which go progressive more out of wack for the 60"" tv.  I will have to take the tv down again, which is a pain and loosen the lag bolts and try to see if i can get it more level without having to remount all over again, i might have to go get my 3ft level our of my trunk of my car.

"This is an extremely well thought out mounting system. The instructions were detailed and clear, and the mounting system came with all kinds of fasteners and spacers for just about any kind of TV model adaptation.  A spirit level is included in the kit, which was a really nice touch!  just the right size for conveniently ensuring that the mount is absolutely level.  The spring loaded bottom clips with pull tabs are a great idea!The instructions stress to ONLY use the lag bolts into wooden studs, or a concrete wall.  They specifically state to NOT use drywall anchors, and I can heartily agree with their warnings.  The lag bolts were very easy to use, and I have had plenty of experience with drywall anchors, both toggle bolts and other kind of in-drywall anchors eventually cutting through or working out of the wall over the years and dumping stuff on the floor.  Vibrations in the house eventually degrade just about any drywall anchor connection that is under significant static load.",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"Like the title says, you get a lot more from this mount than what you pay for.Installation was actually pretty easy. You'll need a stud finder, a 5/32"" drill bit, a drill, a pencil, tape measure, and a 1/2"" ratchet (at least to make it easy you will). I used a drill to get the mounting bolts in about 2/3 of the way and then had to use the ratchet to get them in. If you have a large screwdriver it can be done, but a ratchet is highly recommended. Comes with a small level that's actually pretty useful. Took me about 10 minutes to install. Also, just an FYI, the smaller model does not come with an HDMI cable, although I'm fine with that because I had several extras laying around.",5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"The instructions advise that if you are spanning three studs (standard 16"" on center), you should attach the wall bracket to all three studs using six screws.  However there is no center hole on the bracket to use to attach to the center stud.  And the span of the farthest holes is 32"" so there is no latitude to move the bracket slightly left or right to align a hole with the center stud.  I thought  attaching the wall bracket to just the two outer studs (32"" apart) would be sufficient.  However, the wall bracket bows away from the wall under the weight of the TV in the center.  ( My television weighs 45 lbs. and the maximum weight specified for the wall bracket is 132 ibs.)  I will need to drill a hole through the metal bracket to attach it to the wall at the center stud.",3,1,2020-1-29,1,2,0
Alright so i waited a couple days to post a review. What i like about this product is that it does it what it says(mounts your tv :) ). It is quite sturdy and not at all complicated to put together. It comes with instructions and a small leveling tool. I would recommend you get this for the recommended tv sizes each version can hold. It does have a slight tilt forward i believe a few degrees forward. The tilt is decent enough depending on how far the tv is from the bed and how far up you place your tv. If its above your eye level then you might want another product depending on how big your tv is. If its just at eye level and below then you should be good.This took me about 1 1/2 hours because i wanted to make sure it was even and that it was going to be secure. Also it took me awhile to figure out how to operate the hand drill properly before i could get things to go smooth.  The 4th picture is all the tools i used to mount my tv.,5,1,2020-8-19,1,1,1
"Bought this to mount 50” TV in our living room. The mount is great, no complaints there. The straps at the bottom that are used to release the mounting arms from the mount on the wall are a little long, but we easily cut them to size so they didn’t hang below TV. Only reason I give this 3 stars is because the level that was included with this mount was total garbage. I didn’t check it before I mounted to wall and TV was not level by 1/4”. I went to my garage, got my own level and remounted the mount to the wall, everything was fine then. I even took the included level and put it on our mantel (which was of course level) and it showed that our mantel was not level. Be sure to use your own level if you buy this mount!",3,1,2018-5-6,1,4,0
"Pros:- This is a great, sturdy product and their support is 100% fantastic. Just give yourself some time depending on your method.",4,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"I have worked in the audio/video business and have had extensive experience with mounting brackets, so I was skeptical about the quality of a bracket at this price point. Upon receiving this bracket, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and design, and that they included everything needed to install the bracket (except tools of course). The provided level  and HDMI cable were an added plus. Installation was easy and seamless our new 50"" mounted up with no problems. Other reviews have mentioned that the screws used to attach the two sides of the mounting plate together were too big for the threaded holes. This is due to paint in the threads of the plate. Once you get the screws started they go in no problem.The only complaint I have is that it is nearly impossible to tighten the set screws holing the TV at an angle due to how close the TV is to the wall.",5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"Easy to install, cheap priced especially during the holiday season. The included level is cute, but use a bigger one. The longest part is the trial and error and figuring out what works best for you and your wall. A week later I had to adjust my tv with bigger spacers for better tilting. I tilted the tv about 4 degrees or half way and it feels stable. Only flaw is, like what others have said, that there should be a center drilled hole from the factory especially for 16 inch studs. But with that said I feel comfortable using only four screws as it supported my weight (265 lbs) and my LG weighs 50 lbs but YMMV. Overall, a good mount. I am glad I did not spend more on mounts from other stores.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,3,0
"I have never installed a tv on a wall before & I was flying solo on this project so I could surprise my husband. The bracket was perfect for my needs. Simple design with multiple mounting holes, allowing me versatility in how I secured it.- TV size is 65""",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,1
Good straightforward mount that works as you would expect. The wall plate comes in two pieces and you screw the right side rails to the center bracket. This could be a problem for some. The release pulls are adjustable in length to help hide them behind smaller tv’s. I am using this in a rental unit and found it to be quality substantial enough for light commercial action.Works great for a flush mount on a very thin led backlit 55” tv.,5,1,2020-5-11,1,1,0

"So I have installed many and I mean many different types of TV wall mounts.  These are the best and easiest TV mounts that I have installed.  I have now installed 14 of these mounts.  I like that they are thin and keep the TV close to the wall.  They allow plenty of tilt in the TV.  They came with everything needed to install (including a cute little magnetic level) :).  I don't use them but at least they come with it.  I now have a bucket of these little levels if anyone needs one.  So far, It has come with every bolt/bushing needed for every TV VESA setup I have used.  I have used this mount for Sony, Samsung, Vizio, LG, TCL, Hisense, and yes even an Insignia.  Sizes from 40 to 75 inches (Yes, I said 75"").  I don't know why the 70"" limit.  The LG 75"" fits great on them.  So far they have spread across all stud setups.  Haven't had a need to use a molly yet because there are so many mounting holes on the base.  If I have one complaint to be nit picky... the straps on the tv vesa mounts for the latches are too long.  In order to hide them after mounting a TV, you need to tie them up.  Forget using the adjusting slide, it doesnt get them short enough. Before mounting the TV I have learned to use a wire tie to hold them up and then put TV on wall.  I can mount a TV now in about 15-20 minutes with these mounts.  But of course I've done few now.  I would give yourself about 40-45 minutes first time.I am very confident that anyone can mount a TV with this mount.  Its that simple.  2 Screws to assemble the back plate.  4 lags to mount plate to wall.  4 bolts for TV VESA.  Lift it up and put it on the bracket.  Push slightly on bottom of tv till you here it click in place.  Than you can slide it on the mount right or left to tweak it where you want.  Done.",5,1,2020-5-10,1,1,0
"The very first things that impressed me  on this TV mount was the price and the ultra fast delivery. But, seeing the product was a real wow!For our TV wall installation, I wanted to make certain that wall mount would include 24"" on centers mounting-and it does. When opening the box, it was determined that was well made. It was also very simple to put together and mount to the wall.",5,1,2018-12-1,1,2,0
"I wanted to center the TV in the wall. In my case there was a stud right in the center and the next ones 16"" in each directions. That seems ideal but really isn't. I have a 46"" TV. If I wanted to hit two studs, I would have had to hit the center stud and another one to the left or right of it. This could have almost worked IF the mount had been a lot wider or wasn't split and screwed together via that middle plate. The 8"" spacing of the hangers combined with the amount of space the middle plate takes up makes it impossible to position the TV properly. If the back had been one solid piece, I could have slid the TV along the mount until it was centered. Luckily I found another mount at MonoPrice that is 33.8"" wide (one piece) that will reach from the left stud to the right stud and should hold my 46"" TV as well as hopefully a future 70"".",2,1,2019-1-21,1,3,0
"Great item!  Installed myself with no problems.  I will add that I have never installed a tv wall mount before.  I did watch a couple youtube videos first.  Came with enough bolts and washers to get just the right fit for my tv.  Cannot believe how affordable it is, and very sturdy.  Will come back here for my future needs.  Bought it for my craft room to watch Netflix and Youtube videos.  I installed a TCL Roku tv, and loaded enough apps that I can watch live tv (via the various network apps), and didn't need to get another box from my Satellite provider.I also purchased this item:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H8BXIE4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_10, to provide a longer cord for my wall mounted tv.  Next step is to drop the wires behind the wall.  You can't beat the availability of necessary items on Amazon.  Saved me tons of money purchasing here.  And, I would say this is equal to any other retail items.",5,1,2017-6-16,1,7,1
"This here TV mount was perfect to hang my new 65 inch TV over the fireplace.  I figured I’d get me one of those bigger screen TVs so I wouldn’t have to squint to see what was playin, and man oh man, it looks awesome. Anyway, this mount was super easy to install. It even came with a small magnetic level to help get it right! My wife was very impressed that I got it hung up straight the first time and didn’t have to use a hammer to “adjust it” anywhere. Very simple instructions that were easy to ignore, since it’s a pretty straightforward installation. Don’t get me wrong, I looked at the instructions every time my wife walked in to check on me, but promptly dropped em when she walked out.  Ya’ll don’t rat me out now.  She thinks I followed them instructions to a tee!! Heck, a quick glance at the picture on the box was enough to figure this thing out. The TV is hanging up there right nice and has been for a good month or so. My wife has commented on how well it looks several times, so I guess I’ll give this mount a good thumbs up.",5,1,2020-6-19,1,1,0
"It held up my moms 50"" LG TV with no problems. I will admit it was a little bit smaller than I expected, but the only reason why I think it is small is due to the long large one I bought years ago that is nearly double the size. Since it is not that ling, you have less frame to work with to center on your walls. Because you have to screw these wall mounts on the studs. With that said, I was able to mount it up with all kinds of screws and little level it came with. It also came with an HDMI cable as a bonus I guess, you can always use extra hdmi cables!Her TV has been mounted for 4+ months now and holding strong. I think it's a good cheap rout to have.",4,1,2016-4-10,1,1,0

"Used this to wall mount my 58” plasma TV. Installed in about 30 minutes including attaching brackets & spacers to tv & wall. If you have a large TV with VESA mounting holes this is a great product at a fantastic price. Only tools I needed was a drill & drill bit. It comes with a tiny bubble level, but I used a 4’ level for increased precision to level the wall mount.",5,1,2019-1-23,1,5,0
"You get what you pay for. In the case of this particular TV mount, that stands true. For the low price, don't expect something of great quality, because you won't get it. If you go in with the mind set that this mount is fairly inexpensive, then you will be happy in the end. If you have a TV that is relatively light, then this mount is truly all you need. While it claims to support 100+ lbs, I am not sure I would test that theory.The mount itself comes in two pieces which is part of why I removed one star from the rating. This causes it to be be true and bend slightly. It can also cause it to twist which leads to your TV not being level. It also comes with a 50 cents level to help. You can never fault a company for providing extra items, no matter the quality however I would of liked to see the bubbles in the stand itself.",4,1,2019-7-9,1,1,0
"This mount is easy to install however the back wall mount plate should be wider to span three studs on 16"" centers.  The design does work for two studs BUT the anchor bolts will not be at the ends of the bracket.  If you set bolts on one end on stud the other end will be much further in from the other side.  That said, you can hang anything from this bracket once installed.  The hardware is very complete and included various spacers to position the TV further from the wall if it is required for cable hook up.  The latching system is all metal and appears to be very well made and strong.  It took about 30 minuets to settle wall plate  including locating stud centers both with stud finder and small pilot drill bit.  The anchor bolts are substantial and this hanger should support the weight as advertised.  I am hanging a 55"" TCL to the wall and it certainly will be more the adequate.  The tilt function is easy to set and adjust just tighten the bolts to achieve the proper tension and the angle is easily adjusted.  All hardware  except the spacers is metal and the packaging of the hardware is exceptional in terms of each group of items are individually sealed and marked so that it is easy to identify.",4,1,2019-8-19,1,1,0
"We have had a few different versions of TV mounting brackets and this one is the easiest we have installed! We have 5 TV in the home, and recently added this one for our 70in TV. We like it because it's simple to install, the mounting hardware is easy to screw in and will work with standard 16in studs. Once the brackets are installed to TV and wall, its super simple to mount. You just hang the TV from the top portion of the bracket and then pull the cord to lock in the bottom.  Since mounting, we have moved the TV off that wall about 4 or 5 times quickly and easily to paint or add shelving - each time it was effortless to reinstall. There is also just enough space on the back of the TV to see where to plug in everything - but I do advise plugging in all devices and connectors TO THE TV first if you can before mounting - then attach them to the cable box/surround sound or other devices after you hang the TV.",5,1,2018-11-3,1,4,0
"It’s a pretty good mount I’m a fan of mounting dream mounts. This one is the worst I’ve used from the brand. It’s on piece, well built, and sturdy as usual. Less hardware is included in the box. I’m assuming it’s because it’s meant for bigger televisions. It was tough to find bolts that fit the 70” LG T.V I installed. I ended up having to use two spacers along with the longest bolt. The biggest and most infuriating disappointment is that this mount has a tilt feature 8 degrees which is pathetic. Tilting it at its max causes the hooks to narrow to much for it to latch. Rendering the security latches useless. Obviously this is a products with a design flaw that nobody seems to have bothered to test.",3,1,2019-1-7,1,3,1
"This is the second Mounting Dream TV mount we have purchased from Amazon. The first one was for our patio outside and was an articulating mount. It was so strong and well built I decided to pay a little more for a simple tilting wall mount for our bedroom.  They provide several types of VESA bolts to fit many different TV mounting holes. They also provide spacers, washers and lag bolts. Since I was attaching a 50"" Plasma weighing about 75 lbs on a metal studded wall I bought 6 snap wall toggle anchors as was recommended on a YouTube about mounting on a metal studded wall. The ones I got were from Home Depot and 4 of the six broke while inserting into the drilled hole. Fortunately I have standard 3/16"" toggle bolts. While harder to install they worked much better and more secure so if going into metal studs I recommend standard toggle bolts. Be sure to find the center of the stud by using a magnet and nailing on both sides of the studs to find the center. Back to the mount; it is really well designed and strong. You can adjust it many different ways which is a must due to spacing of the studs which is usually 16"" apart. You will love this mount.",5,1,2018-8-6,1,2,0
"Mount sits on the wall OK, but the attachment points at the back are trash, so once its attached to the wall I hope you dont have anything else to plug in.  The little cables that are supposed to pull the clamps down will also break, since, you know, the clamp wont move.  I'm giving it 4 stars for sturdy because it seems ok, but I could screw a piece of plywood to my wall and that would probably be sturdy, too.  Probably roughly as functional, too.",1,1,2019-7-31,1,4,0
"Pretty simple and straightforward installation, though a couple tips for novices like me.They don’t spell it out, but the awl in the instructions is to poke in the wall and make sure you’re going into a stud before you drill big holes.  If you don’t have an awl you can do the same thing by hammering a small nail into the wall. The smaller nail the better. If the nail goes in and comes out very easily (i.e. you can do it with your fingers), it’s not in the stud. Invest in a decent stud finder, better models will indicate the middle.",4,1,2019-7-4,1,1,0
"I wanted the wall-mount my TV to reclaim some space in my cabin. This wall mount did the trick, but I feel the need to point out some issues that I encountered during setup.First off, the ease of installation depends on your TV. I have a Samsung KS8000, and no combination of the included mounting spacers would work for me. (Honestly, in that respect, this kit feels a little thrown together.) That said, I've mounted my TV to a floor stand before, so I thankfully already had the mounting hardware that I needed for the portion of the mount that attaches to the back of the TV.",4,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"I purchased two of these mounts, one in May of 2017 and one in November of 2018. I was very satisfied with the May 2017 mount and decided to purchase and additional. The two mounts looked cosmetically similar (plate, hooks, and pull cord that locks in TV), but unfortunately the manufacturer has decided to reduce the quality of the good considerably over those 18 months. I cannot recommend this product due to this disappointing change.",1,1,2019-1-3,1,3,0
"I was originally worried that I would not be able to do this by myself. I purchased a stud finder, and it also showed me the width of the studs, and used a tape measure to measure between the studs. To my surprise there was a typical distance between two of the studs, but it seemed like I was missing a stud to the left of that! That narrowed my options on where to mount this dramatically. I was able to compinsate for this by just sliding the tv on the mount to the left and it centered it where I wanted it.The instructions call for a socket wrench, and i would HIGHLY recommend this. I tried with a screw driver and it was not able to apply the require amount of torque needed to tighten the screws on to the studs. I am very happy with this purchase and the included magnetic level was a nice touch.",5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"I bought this to mount my 65 inch TCL TV.  It shipped fast and was packaged well.  The mount itself is well built with decent gauged metal.  It comes with a bunch of hardware (lags, bolts, nuts, washers, level, spacers, etc.). I put this on my cement block basement wall.  It does not have anchors for concrete or block, apparently you need to request them separately.  It may have been advertised when I was purchasing this, but I did not see that.  I have a bunch of anchors, so it wasn't a big deal.  It does come with a bracket stencil, so it's pretty easy to plan where to put the holes in the wall.  I used six 3/8-inch anchors and two 1/2-inch anchors to mount the bracket (a bit of overkill).  There are two vertical braces that get bolted to the back of the TV.  It was pretty easy to complete.  It seems more that strong enough for my TV.  It's well priced, comes with lots of hardware, and works.  I'm happy.",5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
Very solid bracket. I used this to mount my 55inch Samsung Curved 4K TVCame with all the included spacers and Allen key needed to adjust the tilt. All you need is a Philips head screwdriver and a 13mm ratchet to install this wall mount.,5,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"This mount was very easy to install. You’ll need a stud finder to ensure it is mounted properly, which you can find for around $10. I got the entire put together solo, and just needed an assist from my wife when we actually put in the tv. It was easy enough that I bought a second one for another room.",5,1,2020-6-27,1,2,0
"Overall, it seems like a solid tv mount! It did take us a while to install it, and I would not call doing so easy. We also have to reinstall it because somehow, even with the level (which is awesome that they include, the tv ended up being crooked on the wall. I am not sure if that means our ceiling is not straight? It would be great if it had a bit more range of motion so we could adjust the angle a bit instead of having to reinstall it. Some positives is that it does give detailed instructions and different options of screws and washers to go with your tv. These items are also packaged in an organized manner. I recommend this for people who are good at installing tv mounts, or at least better than my husband and I are at it!",4,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"This is a very solid and impressively designed wall mount and I can highly recommend it. I originally bought a wall mount from Best Buy that I was ultimately unable to make work because it did not have the right bolts and adapters to fit the back of my new TV.After researching a number of wall mounts, I chose this one and couldn’t be more pleased. It’s sturdy, well designed, easy to install on the wall. And it came with all the possible bolts and adapters that you need for various TVs. The instructions also were clear and easy to follow. One person can easily install this by themselves although it does take two people to hang the TV on to it.",5,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0
"Yes, I have installed this TV mounting wall unit in my motorhome (replaced the old style TV with a new lightweight digital unit). There was really nothing major in installing this mounting unit. The instructions are easy to follow, and there was a large variety of screws, bushings, washers, etc. to perform the installation. I am very satisfied with the packaging, instructions, and ease of installing this product. I cannot think of a thing that could be changed, especially for the price I paid for the Mounting Dream MD2268-MK Wall Mount Tilting Unit. One thing that I would suggest for anyone installing the mounting unit in an RV, such as I have, is to install a stop to keep the TV from sliding side to side, when the RV is in motion. I accomplished this simply by installing a drywall screw to the side of the vertical brackets (that attach to the TV) on the horizontal bracket that attaches to the wall, or mounting surface.",5,1,2018-6-2,1,1,0
"Overall this is exactly what you'd expect from a mounting system. It does exactly what you need to to, it's compact, it's easy to install, and it holds a tv.  My complaint is that it's not wide enough. Its a little more than 2 studs wide. Which sounds great. But when you have a stud in the middle of your wall - it's not. Your forced to hang the mount to the ""left"" and then slide the TV all the way to the right. - The TV looks centered on the wall.That might be fine for a small or cheap TV. If it was just another 2"" wider on each side it would be so much easier to hang where you want. I bought 4 of these but after mounting 2, I'm looking at other solutions and returning the others.",4,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"This seems to be of good quality, but the design is terrible.  There is a big dead space in the middle where you join the 2 wall mounts together to make one.  It takes out about 4"" out of adjustment space.  Doesn't sound like much, but when you are working around a plug...which presumably you are...it makes it extremely difficult to center on the wall, and get the lag bolts into a stud.  I just ended up having to go to Lowes and buy one that is a solid piece, so I have full range of adjustment.  Hopefully I can return this...",2,1,2019-10-26,1,1,0
"Pros: sturdy, small form factor, tilts as advertised, priceCons: the screws were too short, there are loops of webbing dangling down below the bottom edge of the TV, and to adjust the tilt requires an Allen wrench and a very, very slender arm.",3,1,2018-11-29,1,2,0
"Product was simple to install and accounted for almost all the needs of my Samsung 65"" TV.  The only issue is that the bolts for mounting brackets to the back of the TV were not long enough to allow use of any of the spacers on the bottom holes.

"Got this to wall mount my 65in Samsung 7100 (400 x 400 VESA). All screws were included which was great, because I didn’t have any wall mounting accessories with the TV. It looked like screws for most tv types were included in the box. Mounting was easy, even though I’m not very handy. The only problem after mounting is that you can’t plug or remove cables into the tv (atleast in my model).  Also, you need to tighten the hinges before mounting, else the tv will tilt down. It does not articulate down as much as I expected. I now feel I should have gone for a mount that allows the tv to be pulled in and out in addition to being articulated at different angles. That would have better addressed outside light glare issues I have in my living room. Still, it looks sturdy and allows the tv to be placed very close to the wall. For the money, this is a great buy.",4,1,2019-11-28,1,0,0
"This bracket was fine for my 65"" LG TV. Went together easy, has clear instructions and is pretty flexible. Enabled me to pivot my TV down toward the viewing area. The only complaint I have is that once hung, there is almost no room to make connections behind the TV, and the bottom clips don't grab with a lot of force, so when I was wriggling my hand back there to get things connected, the bottom clips popped loose and the TV was just swinging from the top brackets. It was a bit nerve-wracking but the TV never fell. I think this would be a 5 star bracket if the bottom clips were stronger or it had a little more room to swing out at the bottom to make connections.",3,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
My husband and I installed this in our bedroom. It is holding a 55 inch TV. It was very easy to install. It obviously took 2 of us because of the size. I only held pieces while he drilled to make it easier to keep it level.I also helped put the TV on the mount.,5,1,2020-5-11,1,1,0

"Our feedback to our builder is that the electrician seemed to be trying to make it impossible to mount a TV in any spot. They did 22"" gaps between the studs and placed the behind TV mount electrical and wire tubes at the exact wrong spots to work with any TV mount, as well as making it impossible to center a TV. So we went to look for a wider TV mount and this was the only one we could find. Thankfully, it worked out perfectly in the two troublesome spots!This is also the thinnest TV mount I've seen. Our TV is hanging less than inch off the wall, which looks phenomenal.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"We initially set the TV brackets too low and the TV ended up sitting too high! Adjusted them to the lowest VESA screw hole, and the TV ended up mounting right about where we wanted it. The wall bracket is a little over 25"" in length, which is exactly what I needed to mount it to the studs. We took it down again to add the spacers (a bonus) so the surge protector could be hidden behind the wall and accommodate certain plugs. The setup overall was easy. I did add extra drywall anchors because I'm leery about hanging any TV to a wall, but this one, according to its specs, is 30 pounds, so I'm not worried about it falling down.",5,1,2018-12-9,1,1,1
"I gotta say, this was fairly easy and painless when it came to actually installing the bracket. I think I spent more time looking for the studs than what it took to drill and mount the bracket. They really made it simple and easy, and there's videos on You Tube on how to do it if you're more of a visual person. I would say the only downside is that the  range of motion isn't much. Once you mount the TV, you can tilt it downward a bit, but that's it. You can't turn it left or right and it won't extend outward either. I'm OK with it, but other folks might be looking for more. Keep that in mind when purchasing this item.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0

The tv was on a stand in a smaller room so we were able to get that out of the way so besides a great tv mount at an exceptional lightening deal price we now have more room.

"This is a great wall mount. My dad installed it for me super quickly and it does it’s job! The only thing is keeping the release tabs hidden from view, it’s a little hard to do and that might just be because of the TV I have. But I have released the TV on my own and it is super easy to do! One thing to keep in mind before purchasing is do you want your TV to come off of the wall? This amount does not do that and I wish I had researched a little bit more before purchasing. When I wanted to plug-in a gaming system and take out the DVD player from behind the TV, I had to release the whole TVBecause amount does not allow you to move the TV forward.

"I like that this product is simple, solid, does it job well, and it comes with many extra items to make installation easier.  It is well designed, and you can tell they put a lot of thought into the product.  It comes with many screws, spacers and washers in different sizes to accommodate for any size TV or wall type.  It comes with easy to assemble instructions and is efficiently packed in a compact box.  It even includes a free velcro tie-wrap, a brand new HDMI cable and a leveling tool to ensure that the installation is balanced.  I installed my TV on the wall in less than 30 minutes, and it looks great.  If I could give it six stars I would, it's that good a deal.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
Perfect fit between 16” Studs. Bracket is only 16” wide so you will have to mount using last hole on all corners of bracket. No problem for me as studs are 16” apart. Bracket and bolts are plenty strong for large TV. I don’t know why anyone would pay more than $20 or $30 for a different brand. Small level fits on frame which makes it easy to install exactly level. I suggest you buy the next size up in width to give you a little more flexibility in moving TV left to right.,5,1,2019-10-25,1,1,0
"Typical unboxing, dump it out on the bed.  As I decide to go get my level I look down and find that, it comes with one!  No kidding.  There is a 6 inch or so level in the kit.  I was impressed.  It also comes with every size bolt you could ask for, wall anchors and an HDMI cable.  Looking at the picture I see that there is a level, but I guess I over looked that part, but was happy to find it.  Price is right too.",5,1,2020-5-15,1,1,0
"This is a great bracket. Easy to install (if you are mounting into studs 16"" apart). Tilt works nicely once you tighten it a bit. Has about 30 different screws, washers, etc so you should be covered.I like these types of brackets because they have a tight spacing between the wall and tv. If you haven't noticed, newer tvs are getting thicker and thicker every year. Many are 4-5"" thick. Add your mount and that tv can stick out quite a bit. Swivel mounts are 3-4"" which could put your TV 9"" from the wall. That just looks silly . This type is much less and gives a nicer flush fit.",5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"If you are purchasing a new TV this kit would be the perfect hanging solution.There are probably others that fit the bill but this one includes all the hardware I would have needed to hang mine and save trips to the hardware store, including lags for wood framing scenario.",5,1,2018-9-5,1,2,0
"I always purchased my TV Mounts on Amazon but was looking for one over the weekend at different stores like Target, Home Depot, and other similar places. I could not believe how much those stores were charging for an inferior product. At the stores you would have to pay around $80-100 dollars just for a regular non tilt mount that did not include any HDMI cable or anything else. So I purchased this mount for more much much cheaper and it is exactly what I was hoping. A sturdy, easy to install, well built mount that fit right onto my TV. Purchasing a wall mount in a brick and mortar store is literally out of the question.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"This certainly gets the job done. I bought it first and installed my 65” TV upstairs. Loved the look, so I wanted to install a TV downstairs on the wall as well. I purchased the second mount from Walmart, the brand was ONN. It cost me $10 less and has a better range of motion, and better straps to remove the TV from the mount. Overall, if I had to do it again I would have bought two ONN mounts and skipped this one.",3,1,2020-3-25,1,1,0
"Used this to mount my 2016 Vizio P-65 C1 on the wall. Wanted a relatively flush mount that wouldn't break the bank.Overall, the metal plate and screws are all quality at or above the price range. My only issue was that the lag bolts to attach the wall plate are very easy to strip.  Luckily, the bolts are also hexed off on the edges so I was able to use a pair of locking pliers to (slowly) turn the bolts tight. I would suggest just doing this instead of risking stripping the heads like I did.",4,1,2019-8-9,1,0,0
"This TV wall mount was easy to install.  Itis very sturdy for our 65"" TV. I would buy it again if I had another tv. Two things:1) I gave 5 star for range of motion only because there was no N/A option. This is only a tilting mount.",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,1
"I, for whatever reason, thought this could turn and tilt at every angle, but it doesn't. It only goes up and down. Which is fine, but it would have been nice to angle it to the right for us.I'm not taking that really into consideration with my star rating though, because that was my fault for not looking into this more.",3,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"Really easy and nice setup, they give multiple sets of screws and spacers tips fit most TVs, and they had the perfect spacer for my TCL TV! Super sturdy and is nice that you can tilt it down or have it flat against the wall!Easy to pop the tv on and off as well the the safety latches",5,1,2020-6-11,1,2,1
"I have never mounted a TV before so I was a little unsure on the best mount to buy considering all the options out there. I saw that this one was way more affordable than others and had a lot of positive feedback so I took a chance and got one. I am very happy that I went with this wall mount for our 50 inch TCL. The rails on the back fit nice and tightly, and the process of mounting went smoothly for the most part. I did find the screws to be a little frail when pushing them in with a power drill, so I had to use a wrench to crank it the rest of the way.Aside from a few technical issues with setting up the plate, the process was very easy and securely holds my TV in place. The bonus HDMI and level were not totally necessary, but very welcomed.",5,1,2020-5-6,1,1,0
"I saw this supported ""Most TVs"" 37-70 inches, and assumed my older 65 inch Panasonic VIera Plasma would fit. Mainstream brand, less than 70 inches, should be fine, right? WRONG. The mount wouldn't support the larger horizontal space between the brackets.I didn't realize what VESA was until later. Measure the horizontal and vertical space between the mount points first before buying. I was dumb but wish documentation here was a bit better.",4,1,2020-6-8,1,1,0
"Everything is packaged in a surprisingly small box, organized into clearly-labeled packages and detailed with thorough instructions. The pull cords make TV removal and adjustment easy. The included level appeared accurate compared to my normal level (I never trust cheap included ones) and the free HDMI cable was a nice bonus.Everything is metal, although there was a slight bow at the center (the unit is two pairs of rails, joined in the center vertical plate), which I had to accommodate when mounting.",5,1,2018-11-27,1,1,0
"Overall a great kit, mount is solid once assembled, and a plethora of fasteners and adapters are included for just about any mounting format on your flat screen TV.  That being said, the central metal plate separating the left and right sides of the mount, while a nice place to put a logo, creates a limit to how far left or right you can slide your TV on the mount.  This becomes an issue if, as in my case, the studs in the wall don't allow you to center the mount within a limited space in which you desire to place your TV say within a shelving system that has a TV-shaped opening.  In my example that meant I had to locate the mounting plate several inches right of center.  If that center plate wasn't there, I could've slid the TV further to the left to get it centered, but  the plate acted as a hard stop to that.  If you're like me, and need to mount you TV in a designated space, and your studs don't cooperate I would recommend purchasing the MD mount that doesn't have the plate:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HFSBY8S/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1It's dimensionally identical to this mount, but comes in one piece eliminating the stop plate.  It's an all round better choice with better verstility.",4,1,2019-2-11,1,1,0
"This mounts easily and feels pretty sturdy once up, but make sure to locate your 2 studs before buying. If your tv is not going to align perfectly center with the mount based on where the studs are located, you will need to get the larger length mount size. We decided not to exchange as we were anxious to get the tv on the wall, so used 1x3 wood to attach to both studs, then attached the tv mount to the wood. It causes the tv to stick out almost an inch more, which is ok for us but may not be okay for everyone. See photos.",4,1,2019-10-21,1,1,1
"I've been buying thru Amazon since 2003 ( yes, I wish I had bought the stock back then ) . After years and hundreds of items, I can tell you that this is of the best products I 've ever bought. Lower cost than Walmart, Costco , etc., but no lower quality . It delivers what you need at a much lower price . The manufacturer also includes a small level and a HDMI cable with the package . I hung a 65 inches LG LED Tv with it. The whole process of installation took me about 15-20 minutes. Great buy , you cant go wrong.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,1,0
"I found this TV mount well made and easy to assemble.  It had everything I needed for installation (including easy to understand directions and tons of washers, screws and spacer options).  The mount itself has a nice power coat finish.  It is quick and easy to assemble.  The kit comes with various screw sizes, spacers and washers to mount the arm brackets to your TV.  I had no trouble attaching it to my 43"" Vizio.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU USE YOUR OWN TRUSTED LEVEL!  The small levels that come with these kits are not reliable.The most time consuming part of the whole process was marking my measurements and finding the studs.  4 sturdy lag bolts were included to mount the bracket.  Once mounted, the TV is easily attached and locked on with the pull straps.  Some folks don't like that the straps hang down.  You can tape them up if its a big deal but they are way easier to use than the alternative allen screw style.  It takes mere seconds to hang or remove the TV.  This mount is very adjustable. Besides tilt angle, you can also slide the TV left or right a few inches and you can remount the arm hangers up or down for height too.  Another plus is I get to use all the leftover hardware for future home projects.",5,1,2016-5-26,1,4,0
"I installed this mount on my wall last night for a newly purchased 70"" LG TV, and it was incredibly easy to assemble/install.  I was very meticulous with my measurements, which took up the most of my time during installation, but the actual process of assembling the bracket and mounting it to the wall took a whole 30 min tops. After installing the wall bracket with the provided lag bolts, that thing wasn't going anywhere.  My TV weights approximately 67 pounds, and I'm incredibly confident that this bracket will hold it with no problem whatsoever.For anyone trying to dial in exactly how high to install the mount on the wall, there is a very easy process that I used that worked like a charm.  Simply attack the mounting arms to the back of the TV, click the wall bracket into place on the arms, then measure the distance from the bottom of the bracket to the bottom of the TV.  Then, simply add the desired height you want from the floor/mantle/etc. to that measurement, and you're done.  Take this overall height measurement, draw a line on the wall at that height, then mount the wall bracket where the bottom of the bracket rests on that line.  This method worked out perfectly for me.",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"Ordered two of these to mount a couple of older flat screens (42 inch LG and a 42 inch Panasonic). Both of them seemed very consistently machined, but there is enough play in the slots to adjust a little bit to make up for any small differences. Once the plate was bolted to the wall the rest snapped together very easily. My only gripes about it are the adjustment for the tilt on the mount. This needs to be done without the tv being on the wall (which means if you dont like the angle you need to take the tv back off of the plate on the wall). The other issue it that there aren't any marks on the adjustment slot so it can be tricky to get both sides the same since there are two adjustments that are independent of each other. These are minor issues especially considering the price. The mount also comes with an HDMI cable and a small level. Some people that reviewed said that they wouldn't trust them. I compared the included level with my normal one and it's definitely a cheap level but did its job well enough, I used it while mounting mine up just to see and got a good result. The HDMI cable is braided and looks nice but I cant speak to the quality of it. Overall for the price I would definitely reccomend it if you only need left to right and tilt adjustments",5,1,2018-11-14,1,1,1
"The part that mounts into the wall is fine but the two parts that click into the mount are cheap plastic, I actually broke my brand new $3000 TV while installing onto the wall and this cheap mount was likely the cause from trying to get the TV to click into the mount, which couldn’t bc the one plastic part was broken on the right side",1,1,2018-8-19,1,2,0
"I had a bulky lip around a recessed outlet that was in the way of my rack laying flush on my wall. I was able to use the supplied small spacers behind the 4 lag bolts to push the frame off about 1/4 inch or less off that wall to allow my frame to lay even.That’s a clunky issue I had, but due to fixing that. I also resolved an issue another buyer mentioned. Which was that if you go full tilt, the bottom backet on the tv won’t clip onto the of the bottom rack. However, with the spacers this problem was solved and the tv can now tilt without:  1. Hitting the wall at the bottom 2. Fully lock at the bottom of the rack, in addition to the top.",5,1,2019-2-14,1,1,1
"Seller claims will fit 24"" stud spacing but the product is only 17"" wide, making it impossible for the mount to fit a 24"" stud spacing. Extremely disappointed that my time was wasted.",1,1,2018-12-30,1,1,0
"Great price. Simple install in under 30 minutes. Mounted a 32"" Samsung LED 1080p HD TV (which is very lightweight). I wanted a mount snug to the wall yet with good access to cables (HDMI, network, power...). It's super simple to attach. Instead of a ""VESA"" mount, you simply align the two vertical mounts and secure to the TV. The Mounting Dream kit came with ample size & length screws, spacers, etc. I did not use the anchors they provided. I prefer self-starting drywall anchors. Used 4, 75lb rated anchors (over engineered :-))  The only 1 design improvement I'd wish is that the latch / unlatch straps at the bottom had an easy way to retract them out of sight. Since it's close to the wall, it's a bit of a challenge to hide them or zip-tie them out of sight. But hey, for the price, no complaints.",5,1,2018-4-4,1,1,1
"First, this is a nice mount at a reasonable price. However, I took off 2 stars for the additional 2 holes that must be drilled right in the middle of the mount (through the Mounting Dream logo) to use all 6 lag bolts. Since we used this for a 75 inch Samsung, the need for 3 studs seemed only right. However, it would be nice if the bracket were either slightly longer or had pre drilled center holes. See photos, drilled holes through the mount. After that addition, the mount took the TV like green on grass.",3,1,2019-8-21,1,9,1
"Was easy to install.  Clear instructions (lost of pictures) and a what to do sheet for problems.  The design error is in holes.  The two end holes are 32"" center which is perfect.  They send you six lag bolts and four of them fit in the end holes. However in the center (where the other stud would obviously be) and the last bolts installed there is no hole.  So I drilled pilot holes.  They should put in a oblong center hole.  TV looks good on the wall.",4,1,2019-6-28,1,8,0
"This product is incredibly sturdy. No adjustments are required for mounting to the TV, as multiple screw holes are available and the wall mount itself is a fixed width to the part that attaches to the TV. My only complaint is that the screws that come with the TV were difficult to get started into the studs even with a predrilled hole, I ended up using some self-starting screws (after drilling through sheet rock) I already had on hand from another project. On smaller TVs you will need to tape the release strings to the back of the TV or to the wall, otherwise they will be visible beneath the TV. I liked the simplicity and sturdiness of this product so much that I purchased a second one for another TV I needed to mount.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
Mounting was a dream! I was able to install this mount myself in less than 30 minutes. I actually used this to replace a flat mount so that I could hide my Xbox behind it (using a mount genie). It worked out and I now have a professional looking installation for less than $50. I couldn’t find any studs so I used toggle bolts and it turned out perfectly. This mount comes with an HDMI cord and 2 cord straps. It’s a great mount and worth every penny! I’m thinking of returning the full motion mount I bought from BB for the living room and ordering one from this company.,5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,1
"Super easy using Tapcon drill bit and 4 tapcon screws. Mounted this on a brick fireplace and hung a 65in Vizio and now a 75in Hisense. Super easy to set tv and lock it in. As with all close wall mounts, get your cords and cables on the tv before you hang on the mount. Comes with loads of hardware, can't imagine a situation where you wouldn't be covered.",5,1,2020-2-11,1,1,0
It installed well and had more than adequate bolts and hardware.  There is one notable defect.  The spring loaded locking pins that are part of the arms that attach to the monitor are too long preventing them from engaging.  I have sent an email to address for support in the directions with no response.My recommendation to anyone buying this is to verify the engagement prior to mounting it on the wall.  I would have returned it if I knew it ahead of time.,5,1,2017-7-14,1,1,0
"This mount is sturdy and well made.  I would have no issues with buying another or recommending it to anyone.  The supplied hardware is of good quality and should mount just about any TV I can imagine.  I've read a few bad reviews of this product but most of them can be attributed to poor workmanship, not poor materials.  This mount does support 24"" studs Not sure how some of the other reviews state it barely meets 16"" studs.  This is mind-boggling to me.  Seriously this is a fine mount and well worth its price.",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"I’ve never hung a television before and figured this was the time after building a home and not wanting to pay someone to hang 4 televisions. This mount could not have been any easier. The only thing I would recommend is find out what screws to use when putting the brackets on the back of the t.v. because it comes with all different sizes.  I would highly recommend this product, amazing price too. The tilt is also easy to use.",5,1,2020-3-30,1,1,0
"This is comparable to the level of quality and ease of install that you could expect from a company like Monoprice except this one had free shipping and came with some extra goodies. They included a level and some other small goodies, I can't remember for sure but I think a tape measure maybe. Regardless, they gave you almost everything you would need and it went up beautifully. I was very impressed with the finish, there were no rough or sharp edges and all of the hardware was expertly machined and organized well. Very impressive quality.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"I use this on my 55"" Samsung and it works perfect. Only problem i will note is that the max size is for a 55"" so if you plan to use it on a  55"" you need to make sure you have it squared up and where you want it prior to screw it to the wall as you will have no side to side adjustment.I used lag bolts and mounted (2) 36"" sections of 2x4 to the wall and then mounted the mounting plate for the tv to that. It's not likely you will have 2 studs spaced in the perfect spot to be able to mount it directly to the wall so you will need to do this if you plan on using it for a large tv.",5,1,2019-9-4,1,0,0
"I bought this to mount a 43"" Plasma HDTV to my wall, and is the first time I have ever mounted a television to a wall.  Instructions were clear and I like the fact that the kit came all the screws necessary to complete the project.  For me, the only challenging part was getting the correct spacers and VESA screws installed.  I had some confusion with what length of screw could be installed with or without the spacers.  I ended up using the longer screw with the spacer which was the right combination.The bracket still feels solid after installation - there are no signs of bending or warping.  This bracket is a great value for cost sensitive consumers that do not want to spend upwards of $100 on a mount that your local big box store sells.  This solution gets the job done.",5,1,2017-3-1,1,3,0
"This is the second Mounting Dream wall mount I have purchased, with this being a larger one as I had a 55'' TV for a different room and bought this for a new 65''.These things are amazing. the instructions are easy, mounting is easy and in comes with so many different options to ensure it will work on basically any TV. The TCL I purchased has a weird bulge that made fitting this a bit awkward compared to my other TV, but the spacers made them a non issue.",5,1,2018-11-30,1,1,0
"This was easy to install, came with more than enough mounting option screws, washers, shims, etc. Solid, sturdy unit. Note, tilt is very limited and if you need the 24” mounting option you will need to screw the 2 pieces together, it is not one solid piece for that application. This really does not affect too much besides the range of motion of the clips on the rails since the mounting screws will limit their range to slide horizontally. For this to affect you though you would have to be way off on your measurements as far as how much you need to slide the TV from side to side to get it where you want it to be. But overall I am very satisfied with the purchase and the wall mount does what it is supposed to do.",5,1,2019-4-17,1,0,0
I bought this because I wanted to span two studs unlike my current setup.  It does that fine.  It has all the hardware which I appreciate.  The instruction were easy to understand.  This is a tilting model.  We attached the TV with the idea that we would adjust the angle after we see what it looks like.  Probably a common thought.  We could not reach our arms (even my wife's arm) behind the TV in the limited space to tighten the hex screw that holds it in the angle you want.  Other than that it works as described.,3,1,2019-2-17,1,1,0
"After months and months of having this mount sitting next to my TV on the floor, it's finally up.  It goes up relatively easily if you actually read the directions fully.  My husband thought he could do it by not reading the directions.  Wrong! You really need to read the directions or you may end up with extra holes in the wall.  Like... a lot more holes.What I like about this mount is that the the TV is easily removed or adjusted.  There are little cords you pull in to lock it into place. You can adjust left and right on the Mount.  This was great for us because the studs in our wall weren't completely where they needed to be to center the TV on the wall.  We also have enough room to hide our cable box behind once it's tilted.",5,1,2016-9-9,1,2,0
"Works great. Holds together solidly with no play when locked in. The TV attachments came with a wide variety of spacers and adapters. Only improvement I can see is that it would be nice to have a mechanism or pin that can lock the TV in the upright position. There is a hole in the hinge that the instructions show inserting a pin in to lock it upright, but the kit did not come with a pin that fits. Easy enough fix was to just grab a scrap dowel piece, but would have been nice if the kit included a specific part to fit the hinge and lock it in place.",5,1,2019-11-16,1,1,0
"Does the job beautifully !I am extremely happy with this purchase. It is very easy to install, and they provide so many tools in case you don’t have them, such as a level, and 10 different screws you may need.",5,1,2018-3-27,1,1,1
Good- It has pull strings to release the lower locks. That I love. My other mount requires you to get a pole and push a tab down to release the bottom.Bad- It only comes with four bolts instead of six. You'd think that if this can hold over 100 pounds they'd include six bolts to put in three studs.,3,1,2017-2-13,1,2,0
"Installation was pretty simple, with a lot of extra hardware included which would allow for different TV's/Applications.  The mount is well made and allows for tilt, and some side to side adjustment, so the mount allowed my TV to be centered in my space despite the location of the studs.  Basically you bolt the mount to studs in your wall, attach the bracket to the back of the TV and hang the TV onto the mount, tilt as desired, and slide side to side.  Looks and works great, reasonably low profile design.",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"Great simple mount for my bedroom TV.  Easy to install with few tools.My only complaint is that my TV had the largest VESA pattern(400x400) that this mount accepts, and because of that there is minimal room for left/right movement on the mount-basically the TV side and the wall side are the same size, not as it's pictured where there are inches to either side of the vertical(TV) mounts.  I wanted it centered anyway, but when trying to get the TV on the mount(without help) it was had to get it in the right spot, usually being hooked just barely on one side.",5,1,2018-8-28,1,1,0
Mine was installed by the amazon pro who mounted the tv within 20 mins without any issues.The disappointing thing is that you cannot tilt in once mounted. I only learned that after he mounted it...I was counting on being able to tilt it down when I wished.,2,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0

TV mounted easily and even with just under 10 degree tilt I had no issues with connections and cables behind the TV.One of the arms that mounts to the TV did not want to latch onto the frame even when pulling down the release cord.  I could get it to catch without the TV mounted, but once the TV was mounted I was no longer able to place pressure in the right location to get the catch far enough over the frame to mount.  Does not affect appearance and as one of the two are latched and I don't live in an earth quake area and too high for kids to reach it works fine, but why removed 1 star.",4,1,2016-7-11,1,3,0
"Hands down would buy a Mounting Dream mount again and I highly recommend it.  I've used a couple of other mounts in the past.  The monoprice mount I used in the past was good, but this Mounting Dream is even better.  It comes with all the bolts, washers, and spacers you need.  It will mount by default very close to the wall, and I wanted to leave some space to be able to plug/unplug cables so I used spaces which were fairly easy to use. You get a lot of options with the included spacers which is nice.  I haven't used the tilt for my setup, but it looks like it will work just fine and will actually hold the angle you want.  Definitely sturdy and easy to mount and remove.",5,1,2019-7-25,1,0,0
"It does exactly as one would expect from such a heavy-duty wall mount. The parts included are robust and they didn't leave anything out and basically give you every type of screw/fastener you could possibly need to get the job done. They make no assumptions. It was also stupidly easy to install. I have a 15 year old 40"" Westinghouse LCD monitor which weighs about 85lbs and it handles it no problem. I suspect it could carry far than 200lbs if you use the beefy lag bolts (included) affixed to the wall studs. It really is a heavy-duty mount.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"Very similar unit to ones I've used in the past.  This model differs in that the actual mounting arms have a better designed hinge as well as straps that hang down so you can easily pull the release should you wish to move the TV.The negative would be the convenient little level they include. I used it since it was right there but it didn't seem straight. I compared it to my own level and sure enough it was off.  The level is cheap and kind of useless, but the mount is fine.

"I wanted to love this product. It does it’s purpose but it wasn’t awesome. You have to tighten the screws before you put it on the wall meaning you put it on the wall, figure out how you want to position it and then take it off and tighten the screws, there is no way an adult man could fit his arm on there while on the wall. The level it comes with is handy, it had all the parts and went smoother than a lot of wall mounts I have used.

The tilt feature is ok, but it is fixed. It would be very hard to change once you set it to zero or eight degrees. If you are planning to change the tilt from time to time, I would recommend spending a little more and buy a better one. I just needed to install a 45"" inside my bedroom and this fit the bill. I would not have chosen this for my living room.",4,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"This is a great mount. Inexpensive and easy to install. Comes with all the necessary hardware options to work with most brands and styles of TVs. I have 2 of these for different brand/size TVs and they were installed with ease. I did have a few questions so I reached out to the seller in a direct message. They went above and beyond to help me with my specific mounting questions. I highly recommend this product and the customer service goes above and beyond. If you do run into issues while using this, don’t give up, just reach out to the seller. A+ experience.",5,1,2020-6-17,1,0,1
"The Mounting Dream Tilt TV wall mount is a great product.  I used it to mount my 55"" Samsung TV to the wall in the bedroom and am very pleased with the results.  The mounting bracket was super easy to install with a drill and socket set and the kit provides several different types of screws/spacers/washers to fit to your individual TV.  The instructions were easy to follow.  I like that the mount has an 8 degree tilt option to make the viewing angle just perfect depending on where you want to sit/lie down to see the screen.  Very sturdy, easily holds my TV in place.Highly Recommend!!",5,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0

"My only complaint, and this would be common across all wall mounts of this style, is that the loops on the bottom are too long when mounting a relatively small TV. I have a 40"" TV mounted with this (went with this particular mount due to 24"" stud spacing), and have to basically tie the dangling loops together so they aren't hanging down below the bottom of my TV.",5,1,2020-6-8,1,1,0
"Made of heavy duty painted steel, this wall mount is extremely strong and well made. They provide a large package of mounting screws in different lengths and gauges to attach the bracket to your TV, so you can be assured that one set will fit. They also provide a large set of different sized spacers, so you can space the bracket away from the TV (necessary for some TVs). You can also use spacers to space the TV away from the bracket to allow it to tilt down more without the bottom edge hitting the wall.It comes with heavy duty lag screws and washers, and even a torpedo level (handy) and a high-spec HDMI cable. They give you everything you need in one great package.",5,1,2018-1-7,1,1,0
"It took a while to figure out what spacers and screws to use but once that was done, the mount went in easily.  I bought my own lag bolts because a few reviewers mentioned bolts breaking off inside the wall, which would have been a tragedy.  If you want your TV mounted parallel to the wall, I suggest laying the TV face down on a soft rug on the floor.  Then install the wall mount connectors on the back of the TV and use a good level to adjust the degree of slant.  I had no issues with the wall portion of the mount being in two sections.  I just tightened the heck out of the eight screws that hold the two halves together.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"Unbelievable that you can buy something this good for just a few bucks.  The hardest part was finding the studs.  The mount is very solid steel with a flat profile when installed.  It's literally less than 2 inches in total.  Worked great for my 65 inch TCL Roku 4k TV.  The swivel mechanism works well too.  My only fear is that someone's kid my grab the quick release straps and it falls off the wall. lol.  Don't buy a more expensive one.  This one is great, comes with all the tools including a level!",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,1
"Using this currently on a 55"" LG TV that was attached to a wall with studs, and have to say, it fits the need fairly well. this mounting dream installs well, with the base being anchored to the wall, the brackets screwed to the TV hung on the top, and slots for the bottom to fall into place for added security as well as better downward tilt.Installation process was a breeze. Clear directions, laid out well with black and white pictures and diagrams. One of my favorite features though was the somewhat new fad of having all of the screws/bolts/spacers/etc. in neatly labeled, sectioned off plastic partitions that corresponded with the letters called out in the directions.",4,1,2018-5-22,1,0,0

Very nice mount that seems well built. It’s been holding a 55 inch Sony tv up for about two years now and I haven’t had any issues with it. The tabs that hand down work well to adjust the TV. Would be nice to have a little more adjustment on the mounting bracket itself in case you’re level is busted that way if things aren’t 100% level you can make adjustments on the fly. Note that it does have some adjustment but I can see how it may not be enough for some. Overall for the price this mount is excellent.,5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"The level is off, don't use it.  Also don't measure your level on the center piece.  I found that mine was slightly off center, but the left and right sections where the mount goes on were.Also, the release strings are too short for my 65"" Q90R, which wouldn't be a big deal of there was a ring or something to grab onto.  I put two zip ties into each side for easy grabbing if needed and taped them behind the TV so they don't hang below.",3,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
"This is not ideal for over a fire place. The mounting bracket isn't wide enough to make it fully reach 24"" beams on walls. If your over your fire place has 24"" or more between studs, then you will have difficulty getting the bracket up. It's best if you screw a runner of 1x4 piece of board for top and bottom bolts before using this. This way your nails will have a secure base when mounting.The tilt feature is nice and being able to slide it to the left or right to center it is also helpful.",3,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
I actually purchased 3 of this up on installation  I realized the bracket was bent Plus 1 of the pins In the back was defective now the TV looks slanted Because of the wavy bracket Didn't wanna go through the hassle of on installing everything all over again to return the item so just left there alone but I was so angry because the levels would give us a good level reading but the TV was slanted until we realized by sliding the levels i say levels because we used 2 since we thought the level might be defective so by sliding the leves we realized the wall mount was  Wavy now thats the reason the TV its not properly  Level,1,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0
"We bought this TV wall mount bracket for our guest room after getting a 40"" HD TV from a relative. We were concerned with the weight of the TV and if the bracket would be sturdy enough. After unpackaging the neatly arranged items and beginning our project, it was clear that each item was labeled to easily identify which parts were needed for our TV. After a few measurements and calculations, the TV Wall mount was installed. The TV is in a smaller room, so we liked the full tilt down so that someone can rest in the bed and easily watch TV. It is really a heavy-duty bracket that is easy to install. It sits close to the wall so you don't see the cords and back of the TV.We plan to get another wall bracket to install in our living room where there is no TV. We will hide the wall bracket with a picture. Then, when the big sports events happen at our house, we can take the picture down, easily move the guest room TV to the living room, and have a bonus room for sports!",5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,1
"This works perfectly for my Samsung MU6300 50” LED. Make sure you check the back of your TV for the built in holes, they need to be no more than 16” vertically and 16” horizontally. I did have to run to Lowe’s to buy bolts and nuts because I am not mounting to a wall, so wall screws that were included did not help me. I have an entertainment stand that has a plate I wanted to secure my TV to and needed this kit. The 4 bolts and nuts from Lowe’s cost me half the price I paid for this stand. It is an amazing value and sturdy and works absolutely perfectly. Do not need to spend a fortune anywhere else, order this kit, it works great!",5,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"I looked at a lot of models for the installation of a 40"" TV over a fireplace mantle. I needed something with a lot of holes because I had to put the screws through mortar between the stones. I was also concerned as some of the stones stick out from the wall, but this thing was perfect! The spacers (which I think are actually to be used for the brackets to mount to the TV) were perfect for getting the right distance from the mortar on the fireplace. The hardware it came with was excellent and it even said that I could get concrete anchors by calling a number. I had some concrete anchors of my own and so I didn't call, but it's nice that's an option. Holds the TV very well and was easy enough to install.",5,1,2018-8-21,1,0,0
"Super easy to install. I bought and installed 2 of these in about 45 minutes. Will need a stud finder, drill/driver and a 1/2” socket. The rest of the hardware is included. *NOTE* if your TVs mounting screw holes are wider then 24” horizontally and/or 16” vertically, this mount will NOT work for you. I mounted a 55” Panasonic and a 65” Vizio with this mount.  Good quality materials, very secure. Over all this is a great mount, comes with Velcro cord ties and a very nice HDMI cable.

Very impressed with this mount!  Simple install and holds my 2012 Samsung 48” with no issues.  Tight enough to the wall and I dig those tether handles to release them if I need to take the tv down off the mount.  The kit included everything that you would need including a level and a strip of Velcro to tuck wires or tethers.  The only CON I could pick apart from this kit would be the lack of washers for thickness with the spacers.  I needed a wince more to keep the mounting rails on the tv from wiggling so I grabbed some extra washers in my shop to tighten them up.  A week ago I bought a tv from BestBuy for our living room and was contemplating a mount for our bedroom which were priced around $99.  No dice!  This is MUCH better in my opinion and for a fraction of the cost.,5,1,2018-8-15,1,0,1

A lot of the reviews here have already covered the product itself, so I'll just share my install observations to help you have a hassle-free experience.- The low profile will make it impossible to get to any outlets in the back of the TV, so make sure to plug those in first before mounting TV.",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0

Very well built and many of the problems associated with TV wall mounting have been eliminated with this one. The instructions are clear, concise and well illustrated. It seems very strong and would probably hold much more weight that it is rated for. I love the pull tabs to lock and unlock the TV to the rails. That makes installing, uninstalling and cleaning much easier by not having to reach behind the unit with a screwdriver to loosen the screws.",5,1,2018-7-6,1,1,0

Totally messed us up while mounting our tv and we had to RE DO the entire thing after getting it all mounted because it was visibly crooked. This happened two times, on two TVs, with two of this same level. We thought it was us that messed up both times and then tried to hang a shelf with it, and the same thing happened.

🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Quality: The tv mount comes with different sized spacers in case of a curvature to the backside of the television mounted. It also comes with a magnetic level to help with the mounting process.🌟🌟🌟🌟 Practicality: The tv mount does a great job at holding your tv in place when hung on studs.

"Bought a 55"" UH7650 tv, it has a slight hump at the bottom so wasn't sure if these thin rails would work but they just clear the hump on my LG by like 1/4"" or less,  so the TV will sit as close to the wall as you can get it.  This will be mounted in my room so glare isn't much of a problem so i settled for this tilt only version.  Comes with all the screws and washers for most stud like installations,  you will need to buy other screws holders for concrete walls it says.  It even comes with a level to make sure you install it leveled and HDMI cable, not sure if it's the latest type.  Pretty cool, and convenient kit though,  well thought out.",5,1,2019-1-6,1,0,0
"Extremely pleased. Instructions were very clear and it came with a nice assortment of parts so I had no trouble mounting the brackets to my TV. I used this with a Samsung LN52A650 TV (which is about a 52"" 10 year old LCD TV that is very heavy) but it was a snap with this. I have nothing bad to say about this kit and would definitely buy another if I had another large TV to mount. When wall mounting any TV, I recommend buying some right angle HDMI adapters so you can connect the inputs. (Most point downward, but you can find some that point right or left -- I bought ones that directed the HDMI cable towards the middle of my TV.)",5,1,2018-1-7,1,1,0
"My LG is Vesa compatible for 600x400mm and this fit perfectly.  It's extremely low profile so when mounting on the wall with no tilt its a bit hard to see the hooks, but everything goes on well.  The TV is now on the wall and it's very sturdy.One mistake to avoid is to lengthen the straps at the bottom which unhooks the latches.  Since my TV is a 70"" the straps are a bit short in it's default length so when I went to test fit the TV it latched into place and I couldn't unlatch without getting a coat hanger to pull the straps.  So before doing a test fit, make sure you lengthen the straps so it's level with the bottom of the TV before you put it on the wall.",5,1,2018-11-29,1,0,0
"Arguably could give five stars.  This thing is priced right, and is solid, very solid.  Easy to mount.  My only two cons for it are that the bottom clips did not easily clasp.  In fact one is still not clasped, and the other was hard to get the in.  (Sounds like poor English, but it's hard to describe.  The straps on each side pull down, allow you to clasp around a solid mount on the wall.  They would not open wide enough to get in easily.  One side finally went in, the other didn't.  It's more than solid enough, but still a pain).  I wonder if mine was just slightly out of spec, as I have not seen this comment before.  The other con was that the pull-straps hang below the TV, but I just tied them off behind it, so no biggy there.All in all, a good purchase.  I'll likely get a second one for my main TV.

After I decided to choose Mounting Dream over any of the Best Buy products, I realized that I saved over $300 on two wall-mounts from this company.

"This thing comes with everything you need to mount various TVs at various angles. It was very easy to set into the studs using the included bubble level. That being said, a perfectly level TV is actually driving me crazy, because I've now realized my floor is slanted. This causes the TV to look crooked above the table, even though it isn't. I'd recommend putting the level on the floor, marking the reading, then matching that reading when hanging your mount. In most cases, your floor will be level, but for older places (mine is over 100 years old), this step could save a lot of frustration. The latch holding the brackets to the frame is also a nice touch. be sure to hang your TV low enough to cover the dangling loops.",5,1,2016-10-11,1,2,0
1st time hanging a TV. Ordered a fortress mount first. Complete garbage. It falls just shy of 24 inch studs.  I wondered if they'd all be like this. Tried this brand.

Even if I wasn't exactly able to get the studs exact, there is some room to slide the TV left or right for placement correction.

The best part of this mounting set is that it comes with an extra long HDMI cable (because if you mount your TV up really high, you might need it to connect your various devices), all the mounting hardware you may need for different types of walls, AND GET THIS... a leveler!!!

We purchased this mount for an outdoor TV. Originally we purchased a different product but I just did not seem sturdy enough. We did not fit into brick. We had to buy masonry screws instead of using what they sent.

Once the wall bracket is mounted to the wall it was a breeze to attach the TV.  This is definitely a two person job to hang the TV.  There are two separate hangers with hooks at the top that attach to the back of the TV.  The hooks attach into the top groove on the wall bracket.  Once the hooks are in the top groove of the wall bracket, pull the bottom straps and the bottom of the hangers will click into the bottom of the wall bracket.

Can't beat the bang for the buck.My only (minor) complaint is the wall bracket.  It does not have a completely flat surface to mount a level on either the top or the bottom that runs the length of the bracket.  This is due to the 2 part design of the wall mount portion.

"I was very disappointing with this unit. The back metal plate is far too short to mount the TV'sThe TV's are in the size rating stated on the page and yet the wall plate is 1/4"" too short.  Had to use plates from my old mount, but they were narrower so that is just a temporary solution.  I will use the mounts on the TV until I can justify getting  replacement set that works better. If I had a smaller TV thee would work fine.  I am using 42"" TV's",3,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
This bracket comes with all the hardware necessary to mount just about any TV to the wall. The bracket itself comes in 2 pieces but screws together effortlessly. Once you have decided on heigh and measured where it is going it is easy to secure on the wall with the included lag screws. I perform a lot of commercial installs using this wall bracket and in the case of commercial offices with thin metal studs I use a high end toggle bolt which you will need to purchase separately. See the Toggler product (ASIN B0051IBBUE) for this purpose.,5,1,2019-7-30,1,0,1
"The mount is built well as far as I can tell, however the flaw here is in the mounting hardware for the wall bracket. For drilling into concrete it comes with some concrete anchors which are inferior to a traditional TapCon bolt and they don't work for most concrete applications where you have sheetrock over 1x2's with about 3/4 of open airspace between the sheetrock and concrete block. To make matters more difficult, the drill bit that is required so install this product on a concrete wall is probably only available in the town where it's made. 2/5"" bit is what is required, if you live in America and have this bit hanging around your house, I applaud you for having definitely built schools in remote Asian villages as this is the only place I imaging you could have acquired one.The dimensions of this bracket and its holes are not perfect for hitting a stud or furring strip on both sides, and typically they're never where you need them to be anyway. Easy fix here is some 5/16""x3"" Tapcon bolts, a pack of 4 is like 5 bucks. Try getting at least one side in a furring strip but if you can't, cut a small piece of sheetrock out where each hole is going to go, and epoxy a small piece of 2x4 to the concrete, then mark out your 4 holes on the small piece of wood you'd epoxied to the wall, drill through the wood with a 1/4"" wood bit, and then change to a 1/4"" concrete bit and finish the hole. Mount with the tapcons, and you can hang your Aunt Myrtle from this mount. The tilt feature wasn't used in my application so I can't comment on that but it looks very rudimentary.",3,1,2015-5-18,1,0,0
"I purchased this to mount my 55’ tv. It took me awhile to understand the directions as to which bolts/nuts go where along with which washers/screws/spacers because they give you a million options. Unfortunately that’s because there’s so many different tv options out there, not the manufacturers fault. I had to attempt several different combinations of washer/screw/spacer before I got one that I felt secured the mount well enough to my tv. My only other complaint is that this is a fixed mount which doesn’t leave a lot of room for adding additional cables to tv after it is mounted. My suggestion is to add as many cables as possible prior to mounting unless your ok pulling the tv back off the mount.",4,1,2019-8-3,1,0,0
"AWESOME especially for the price!!! easy to install but DO NOT USE A DRILL. you will need a SOCKET WRENCH.first, put mounting brackets on tv itself. then for the wall - use a stud finder to find wood beams. do not drill into hollow sheetrock your tv will fall. once you find studs, mark holes, use a drill bit to make holes. then when bolting in the mount, USE A SOCKET WRENCH. is easy and will get it done quickly. a drill will not work. fantastic mount",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,1
"Just finished installing my 65 inch LG tv on the wall with this bad boy.  Steps were easy.  I added the spacers like it suggested for a little more room between the wall and tv.  It is a two person job and make sure to have all the suggested tools.  Finding the studs are key, so it is not coming down.  I like how the tv can move laterally on the mount, made it easier to get it centered above my fireplace.  Price was great...Best Buy would have charged me five time what this cost.",5,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
"Installation was ok, but it's quite annoying that there's no fine level adjustment built into the mount.  So if you get the wall unit mounted even slightly off level, it will be very apparent on a larger tv and there's no way to adjust other than re-mount the wall unit.  A simple screw would work, like the model I bought 8 years ago?Also, plugging/unplugging HDMI cables requires removing the tv from the wall, at least on our model television.  If you plan to set it up once and forget it it might be ok, otherwise not.",2,1,2018-12-28,1,0,0
"The tv mount has an okay range of motion (up and down) I guess this is due to the price and type of mounting system. Overall It was so so to install we had to look up for a video to make sure it was put on correctly, it happened  to be that we had to remove a little part of washers for it to be 100% stable. (Not a big deal). It’s a good tv mount if you plan to not move the tv much to different directions (besides tilting up or down)",4,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"Works great, nice mount. Locks in place, slides left to right. Tilts forward if ya wanna hang it higher. Also comes with all the hardware and even a tool. Multiple sizes of spacers to help mount it flush to the back of the tv. Also included are instructions!! Lol sometimes rare with purchases on amazon. But for the price I’m happy it definitely serves its purpose in my den. I recommend using wall anchors for heavy TVs",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,1
"Really this is a good wall mount. Construction is good, materials are heavy gauge stamped metal, and it really is easy to install. So why not 5 stars? Because the safety latches on the bottom do not engage. They simply will not go behind the rail. I'm comfortable that there is no way the TV will come off of the mount on its own, but I would have been more comfortable had the safety latches locked on to the bottom rail.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"Easy to install and strong, but the mounting plate comes in two pieces which you have to attach together with 4 machine bolts. The center of mounting plate was PERFECTLY Level when I installed into wall studs, but since the two sides of the plate are separate pieces it cause my TV to sink on one side. This was a very stressful process to fix because I had to undo my hard work to fix the plate. Next time I will purchase a mounting bracket that doesn't separate the plate in two pieces.",2,1,2020-9-17,1,1,1

"We just hung the second of our TV's using this mounting system. Great quality, half the price of what we could get locally.  Super easy to hang the mounting bracket on the wall and the TV.  We've recently got rid of cable and are strictly going with HD Antenna and Hulu/Roku.  Throughout the progression, we've had to take the TV off the wall a couple of times and it's so easy with this system.

"I was a cook in the Navy for 20 years because of my mechanical ability.  When I worked in Audio Video sales I was a very good sales person, but would not attempt to install anything.  Well, I bought two of these mounts and managed to mount 2 lcds, a 43"" Sharp and a 55"" Lg OLED.  These wall mounts were a breeze to put together and the brackets that went on the tv's were simple with a wide variety of bolts, washers and spacers to accommodate all of your needs.

"The base is good overall. I was disappointed woth the tilting option as not being something you can go to and from. Looks like you have to remove the tv and use the L key provided to move the support system and adjust it so the tv tilts. It’s not as easy, will require two people each time and can be a spin in the behind. Other than that, it’s great if you’ll have it in a fixed position, be it tilted or straight.",4,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"This was one of the best installations and assemblies my husband and I have ever done. The instructions were really well written and all the hardware came presorted in its own plastic bag with the corresponding letter. The level it came with was magnetic which made installation even easier. This mount was a fantastic purchase for our TV. The included HDMI cable was a nice touch too. The mount looks and feels very sturdy and I am sure it will last a long time. If you are looking for a nice basic mount, go with this one.",5,1,2019-4-23,1,0,0
"I have extra thick insulation so, I used 5 inch carriage bolt screws (instead of those included), to secure these into 2x4 studs. Otherwise, it was fairly straightforward. It seems sturdy, and the wall bracket can be tilted down for better viewing.",5,1,2020-6-28,1,1,0
"Holds up to its promise! Don’t let the directions and all the extra hardware/screws throw you off, it’s really easy! It only took us about 45 minutes to install, and would’ve been quicker but there were no studs in my wall, so had to get out the drill bits and use six dry wall anchors (always keep a pack of these things handy). Another cool thing, After we install the TV itsat about 1ft too high for me. We easily were able to remove the tv and adjust the wall bracket, lowering to desired height. Great purchase! Would buy again.",5,1,2019-9-14,1,0,1

"I got this bracket for a 52-inch television, which is the maximum size recommended for this bracket.  The bracket feels a bit lightweight for that size of a television, but it is holding it up.  Pros:  It's the only bracket I could find that has the two critical features I had to have for the spot I was putting it, namely (1) a hole in the center (because I have a wall socket sticking out from the wall there) and (2) screw holes in the middle, top and bottom (because I have a stud running down the middle of the fireplace, and the next studs to either side are 22 inches away).  I was able to mount this bracket by bolting it to the stud in the middle, top and bottom, and then balancing it to prevent tilting using toggle bolts through the drywall on the left and right sides.  Cons:  After mounting, there is very little space behind the television to work with.  I can't see back there, and I can't reach back there.  I got the TV plugged into the wall before mounting it, but nothing else is going to fit.  Fortunately, I shouldn't need more than just the power connection and one HDMI cable, but it's pretty limiting not to be able to work behind the television.",3,1,2016-1-4,1,1,0
"The instructions were great, and clear.  The mounting brackets were easy to install, spacers included, made it simple to angle tv .Once the mounting bracket was on the wall, it was easy to clip the TV onto the wall bracket.

"If you want to catch studs [you should] and you have any outlets on that wall, the hardest thing about this narrow [widthwise] mount is making sure they'll be no interference.Took me 15 minutes to triple check everything [up/down, left/right] before drilling the holes into the studs.

"I have to give this product 5 stars.  The unit is very inexpensive, easy to install and is attached to the wall with lag bolts that could hold up my sofa so I certainly don't worry about the tv.  At first I was worried because one of the few pre-assembled parts was done incorrectly and while I could repair it by drilling out two rivets and replacing them with a bolt  I was reluctant to do that.  I called their number and got a busy signal and figured service would be a problem.  They called back within 5 minutes (without my leaving a message) and had the replacement parts shipped to me in under 48 hours.  Companies will have occasional shortcomings but when they promptly resolve an issue completely that promptly they deserve a compliment and I offer them one with this review.",5,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"I've installed several mounts like this before and can say this one is just ok.  It could be the issues I have with it are because of my particular tv but it seems like others would have the same issue.  I bought a 43"" TCL Roku TV from Costco.  The vesa mounts are lower on the back of the tv which causes the release straps to hang way below the bottom of the tv.  There is no recommended solution for what to do with them if this is the case.  So I suppose I will have to tape them to the bottom of the tv to hide them away.  Also, I agree that the tilt cannot be set after mounting.  The adjustment screws are impossible to reach once the tv is mounted because the wall is in the way.  The instruction manual diagram for this makes it look like the wall isn't even there to be able to adjust the screws.  The best you can do is leave them slightly loose so you can tilt the tv once mounted but then it has to be the full 10 degrees.",3,1,2017-7-21,1,2,0
"I purchased this wall mount for a 50"" Insignia Roku TV for our guest bedroom.  The mount is very light weight and was easy to assemble.  All of the required hardware was included.  The product did include a small level but I used a much larger level for the install.  Once the bracket was secured to the wall using the supplied lag bolts, hanging the TV was a breeze.  I did a gustimate on angling the TV down before I hung it which ended up being perfect.  The TV ""snaps"" onto the wall bracket but still allows you lateral movement to fine tune your placement.

"I mounted my 60"" Sharp Aquos HD 3D TV on this without any issue. I particularly love the pull straps to unhinge it from the wall when you want to take it down to paint or otherwise. The level is a nice touch but ultimately not needed as I already have a few of them. But is definitely worth it to the majority who do not.

"Wall mount is super easy to install. Plenty of flexibility for TV placement no matter where your wall studs line up. I installed mine flat, but the frame offers a simple and effective tilt ability.

"Really surprised by the quality of this thing for the price. Comes with literally everything you would need and even a scenario/solution troubleshooting pamphlet. I was worried about how solid it was would be screwed together but its rock solid.One thing that you need to be aware of before marking all your holes, is that the top and bottom mounting channels do not line up perfectly. Mounting on studs this is extremely important, as the top one could line up but the bottom one might not. Wide enough to find a spot where both line up, but if the top lag bolts fit, make sure the bottom ones are still in the stud.",5,1,2019-4-1,1,0,0

"I love buying these mounts cuz they have many options for drilling holes and sit pretty flush. As a TV Technician myself, I highly recommend flush mounts/low pro mounts in general over full motion mounts. Specifically any tv over 70” and above.

The unit has two spring-loaded locks which engage & disengage with two pull-down straps, making it easy to remove the TV from the bracket if necessary to plug or unplug cables.

"This wall mount met all our expectations at a great price.  It was easy to install and everything worked great.  The only recommendation I would make is that it would be nice if there was a bolt hole in the center of the wall bracket.  The instructions say to use all 6 lag bolts if you are mounting at 32"" but there are no holes predrilled for attaching to the stud in the center.  Other than that this is a great wall mount for the price.",4,1,2019-12-11,1,1,0

My only drawback to this was that although I installed my TV mount straight, the border around my door that sits next to the TV isn't level so the TV looked crooked even though it wasn't. My issue with the product is that I wish there was a way to adjust the crookedness after you have installed and put the TV up on the brackets. I have another TV wall mount with small screws that you can adjust with an allen key to fix the side tilt. The solution with this product was the adjust the brackets on the back part of the TV but apparently my door frame was even more crooked than that so I needed a slight bit more of an adjustment.

The electronic stud finder, mine at least, wasn't accurate (edge-to-edge).  The magnetic stud finder, which you can find for around $10 at HD or Lowes, was incredibly accurate.Socket wrench for the lag bolts also made things easier.  Only recommendation:  make the HDMI cable solid black.  The blue coloring makes the cable less inconspicuous.

"This is easy to install and securely holds a 50"" flat screen tv. I only take away one star because once the tv is in place, it isn't easy to adjust the angle or to reach video inputs on the back of the set. The second issue is more due to the set's design because I have another Smart TV that has inputs on the side rather than the back so this mount wouldn't be a problem for newer sets. As it is, I just had to purchase an inexpensive adapter to use my Amazon firestick with this mount and it works perfectly well after a struggle to blindly feel for the input port. Not a deal breaker.

No biggie, don't really need the full articulation where I was putting the tv I thought.  I was wrong.  This one has a very limited range of motion and the tv doesn't really fit tight on the mount--seems a bit suspect when you need to adjust the angle, and I don't have a lot of trust that it'll stay on the wall if someone bumps it in just the wrong way.

Then the plastic divided packaging w all appropriate brand bolts has been torn open (all M6 bolts removed & then apparently returned)  which is of course the size we need to mount brackets to our TV.  Instead of the bolts the torn open empty plastic was left in the package for us. Yet stickered “inspected”??  No tv mounting happening w this purchase. Disappointing because these are well made mounts we’ve purchased many times over the years,1,1,2019-12-24,1,0,1
"Simple system to use - you should be able to find studs on 16"" centers so all four lags are into the wood for great strength. The TV will slide on the rail to center where you want. Otherwise 2 of the screws may need a wall anchor. The screws provided didn't fit my older Seiki TV but I had some already. If you don't need the TV to turn left or right this should be fine. I would recommend.",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
I was at first unsure of this product as I had never mounted a TV to the wall before. However it was truly easy to install. The instructions were clear once you figured out the bolts for the TV. Once up it has not had an issue in six months and seems to be well attached to the wall without issues.Only downside I found was that the little screw to lock the mounting arms after attaching the TV to the bracket is a bit had to reach particularly if it is near another wall. I just took it down and tightened it before rehanging the TV.,5,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0
"Instructions were made by a five year old! Honestly I had to google the proper way to install because the instructions given were lacking so much information. It is not made for a 65’ tv!! There was zero to minimal tilt! Horrible mounting. Also, it was so close to the wall I couldn’t even plug up any of my devices! Waste of money!!",1,1,2019-10-27,1,1,0
I was pretty skeptical at first because of how cheap it was and how the metal on the arms felt. I kept thinking “I’m sending this back probably”.  Was pleasantly surprised.  Very easy to install and the arms snapped right into place with no issues.  We had a Sanus brand tv mount that came with our house and had nothing but issues.  This has been great so far.,5,1,2020-7-24,1,0,1

"The hardest part of installing this TV mount was determining how high above the cabinet to place it.  This mount is sturdy, and comes with a variety of hardware (not all TVs need same size screws / bolts).  It was easy to install, and mount the TV.  The mount is versatile so that you can mount into wall studs, and I highly recommend you use a stud finder just for that purpose.  I would not recommend drywall anchors, as some reviewers claim.  Why take a chance with your valuable TV.",5,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0

The hardest part is finding studs and making sure everything is centered and level.

"The maximum your wall studs can be are 16"" on center, which is the standard for most construction. But if your studs are off by one inch you are out of luck. You either put 2X4s across your studs or order the extension, the extension would great if you have studs on 24"" centers. ****If the mount were made 2 to 3"" wider that would give you the room for some error on your stud placement.**** If that were the case it would be a great mount for the price.

The good news is it is very slim, close to the wall and leaves little doubt that my TV will be damaged in an earthquake (we're in CA).

"You cannot beat these TV mounts - not joking! I’ve gotten three now and they were super easy to install and hold great! They provide you with everything you need to install (except a drill).

"The bars that go on the TV have evenly spaced holes to allow for different VESA sizes. However, the hole that worked for my TV was right above the piece that goes on the mount.

However, it is definitely a design flaw.",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"The level included with the kit was totally inaccurate. Unfortunately we did not realize that until we had installed the entire system and put huge holes in our wall that were not in the right place.

"Easy to mount, light enough for one person to hold while the other person marks off where to drill the holes. The level is a little slow with the bubble not floating immediately but it worked overall. Nice mount. I wish all TV mounts came with tethers on the release pulls. I have a 70 inch TV and the mount did not have them and it was a royal pain to get your arms underneath to find the release pull.

"There's not much to say, it works exactly as it's supposed to. Got it mounted up in about 10 minutes thanks to having the studs marked already. Do yourself a favor and download a digital bubble level app on your smartphone though instead of using the included level. It's not very accurate. But then again, I didn't buy this for the level or included HDMI cable. Also look into HDMI switches, because it is a pain to pull the TV down just to plug something in.",5,1,2018-1-19,1,1,0
"After putting up the wall bracket completely level, the TV sat approximately 1/2in out of level. I had to remove 3 out of 4 screws from the wall and adjust the bracket to make it 1/2in out of level as well and then the tv sat level on the wall. I don’t know if the brackets on the TV weren’t made properly or if the mounting holes in the TV weren’t drilled properly but I had one hell of a time getting this bracket up properly and have several extra holes in my daughters wall that didn’t need to be there.",3,1,2019-1-3,1,0,0
"I purchased this mount for a 46"" Samsung knowing that I only needed a slight tilt while wanting it close to the wall. The frame is very slim, allowing for the short depth from the wall. The TV brackets were average depth. They have a simple swing arm on the TV brackets allowing for the tilt with an adjustable screw to lock them in place.Installation was very simple. Start to finish was maybe 15 min once I read through the simple instructions.",5,1,2019-1-14,1,0,0
"super easy to install. Comes with everything I needed and then some. It came with several different diameter and length bolts and a good combination of spacers (if needed) It even comes with a small level, and nice cable ties. Only tools I needed was a drill with bit and a screwdriver. The tv can be slid left or right on the mount, to help center it better on the wall.The downside is there is no way to lock it into that position. So it can be moved easily by anyone that can reach it. No worry about it falling off tho because there are hard stops on either end of mount.",5,1,2018-2-12,1,0,0
"Works great purchased so the tv would be close to the wall. I wasnt thinking about the added depth of a board for it to mount securely.

"This product has held up over the course of 6 months. I was a little nervous buying a cheap mount, but once I got the product the metal seemed to be of sturdy quality.The instructions were simple, I highly recommend a stud finder and make sure you have a drill bit.

"This is an effective mount that is very cost effective. It's easy to put together and only requires 4 screws into the wall. I love the little extras. The level is great and the HDMI cable has a very strong cord and just what I needed. You can tilt this but we had no need to tilt it. The only thing is that the straps hang down and you'll see it behind the TV. Not a big deal to us but if it is to you, just something to consider. Otherwise, it does exactly what it's supposed to and got our 60"" up with no issues.",5,1,2017-1-19,1,2,0
"There is nothing fancy about this mount.  It does the job as it should.  Its no nonsense and decently easy to install.  I would recommend throwing out the level included and use one you get from the hardware store.  Mine showed level according to the included level.  Once I got the television up, i can see its not actually level.  So I remounted everything, and all is well.  But comparing my level with the included one, I can see the included one is crap.Dont spend more on a wall mount.  All of the same types of mounts do the same thing.

"My TV is about 105lbs and after 1 month it is thankfully still hanging. I didn't have a lot of confidence that it would hold such a big TV and the center of the mount is ever so slightly pulled away from the wall but it's holding up. I would have a bit more peace of mind if there was a center hold directly above the middle bracket so it would attach to 3 studs instead of 2. Instead, the middle bracket blocks the middle stud.

I hung a Samsung 65” 7300 curve with it so in my case you have to use the thin spacers to correctly attach the brackets for the TV side effects o get around the curve.  Nobody tells you this, but it’s important.  Also measurements on placement on the wall are not overly hard, but measure twice and drill once, particularly if you are over a fireplace mantle.  Get the position on the wall high enough so the bottom of the TV doesn’t hit the mantle. Other than that you’re good.  The product is a steal at this price.",5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"Price, simplicity and sureness of latching make this a dream. It constructs to 24” wide with 4 small bolts, guides you to use the right bits and when it snaps into place with the spring-closed latches you know it is secure. It has 4” of adjustment left and right of center for a total of 8”. I had 24” studs. When you pull the latches down they spring back for safety but you can get them unhooked by pulling them alternately and pulling that side away then repeating so that you can swing the TV out to help plug cables without needing 3 arms. It feels secure hanging from the top only for that period while swinging it out the maximum that I could. I did use it on a 75” TV of 75lbs which is a larger screen than labeled for but the reviews influenced me and I am glad. We’ve come a long way when the mount is a trivial cost but where it counts this has the right features. The loops of the spring control will need to be hidden and I think the Velcro included is for that. More advice not related is to make sure your TV optical/coaxial signal is compatible with your soundbar",5,1,2018-7-17,1,0,1
Two thumbs up to Mounting Dream for the way this TV mount came packaged!All mounting hardware came separated depending on your specific mounting need instead of of all being thrown together in a jumbled mess in one bag. Didn’t need to make a run to the hardware store for anything additional as all necessary hardware was furnished.,5,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0

"Good, sturdy mounting system. Relatively easy to install but I would recommend using your own level as the one supplied wasn’t accurate. One part I wouldn’t recommend is the HDMI cable. The connections aren’t very good as they are loose and cause error code “ HDCP Unauthorized. Content Disabled” when using my Roku player. It’s classiias a loose HDMI connection so don’t use it especially if it’s in a confined space. A pain to reset when you haven’t the room to maneuver your hands.",4,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0

If you’re questioning it or don’t believe all these positive reviews—stop! Just add it to your cart now! Literally the only way your mount could fail is from user error—when we hung it, we literally pulled with our body weight before putting the tv on to feel how well it attached to the wood studs.

Sturdy material and very affordable.  I love the unlocking straps on the bottom hooks as well. Great feature seen on mounts these days that wasn’t common 10 years ago when I got my last mount.  I hung a new 55 inch TCL 4 series without issue. Took less then 10 minutes and the longest part is getting measurements right so it’s centered on wall. Came with plenty of different screws and spacers and had no issue finding ones that fit TV.

"This was half or almost a third of the price of the brand at the big box membership store where I bought my TV, a 55 inch Samsung UHD 8 Series. I had to fiddle with the right spacers and screws. It was way cheaper than paying someone. Would buy again! Most of the pain of installing it was my own ignorance, make sure you get it centered where you want to mount it.

My biggest problem is that from time to time I need to adjust the things behind the TV (where I've stashed the AppleTV and antenna) and it is hard to get back there with this.

"This took me all of 15 minutes to install. The tilt feature gives just the right amount of lean for my setup. The release cords are easy to hide and just as easy to operate to move the tv off the mount if need be. Already had plenty of HDMI Cables so though I did not need it, the included cable should be welcome to people buying a new tv.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"Nice tv mount if low profile is what you're looking for. I mounted a 65"" LG and it's a little tight behind the tv, in terms of plugging in hdmi cables, etc... but it's supposed to be. Love how the tv sits almost flush to the wall, doesn't stick out a foot like regular mounts. Easy to install, sturdy materials and construction. I'd buy this mount again for another room.",5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,1
"This was super easy to install! The instructions were very clear and everything was packed in a way that you knew exactly what part was what.Well made, solid TV mount. It was hard to believe the quality of everything for the price.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
This is a fantastic TV mount.  Well constructed and the price is terrific too!  It came with everything I could have needed.  I was expecting to have to go buy the mounting bolts for the back of the TV as I don't believe there is a standard size.  I was surprised to find an assortment of different bolts for this purpose as well as spacers included in the box.  Very easy to install and sturdy too.  I highly recommend this TV mount.,5,1,2018-1-21,1,1,0
"An amazing $17.00 bargain!  I mounted our living room TV years ago, and it was a painful chore even with an expensive mount.  I bought this one for our bedroom TV (38 inch) and hoped for the best.  The installation process was clear and concisely laid out in the instructions, and every conceivable bolt, washer or piece of mounting hardware you could ever need was included.  It truly is a universal mount. Simple installation and a real bargain at $17.00.  Recommended with no reservations at all!",5,1,2017-7-6,1,1,0
Wanted a simple tilting wall mount for my office and this item has met that need.  The materials used are solid and it was an easy install.  My wife and I had the tv up and running in short order. The kit came with a good collection of hardware to adapt to a wide range of mounting scenarios.  Nice product.,5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"I’ve dealt with a fair share of TV mounts in my life but never have I ever seen a TV mount as convenient as this one! Not only was it extremely affordable, but the installation was easier then making your morning cup of coffee. The instruction manual is easy to understand and the supplied materials are divided up into their own sections. Also the company included some nice extras, a leveler, a HDMI cable, and a cable organizer. Lastly, the customer service is phenomenal! If you’re looking for a no hassle, easy to use, affordable, quality TV mount you've come to the right place!",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"This is an awesome mount for the price! It works amazing only thing is I highly advise anyone who is thinking about purchasing this to look into the details. I did not have any supplies to install this and it was a hassle getting around town to put this thing on. You need a drill, wall finder, some batteries (maybe), tools and most importantly TIME. I recommend buying your own screws because these ones that come with aren't that high quality? But Amazon does a great job it came within a day using prime. Thank you!",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,1
"purchased 3 of these for my new home to mount a 42"", 45"", and 65"". They came with all the necessary hardware, instructions, and were packaged very nicely. They are extremely easy to install, have a great tilt on them, and are easily removable if you ever want to take your TV down in a hurry! did I mention the price is so much better than anything else I could find. great investment here",5,1,2019-5-2,1,0,0
Product was great.  Was looking for something cheaper than what the big boxers were offering for 3-4x the price.  Only issue I had was I didn’t confirm one of my older 50” TVs mounting size (I think it’s called VESA)- but bought 3 of these and all were super easy and work great.  I have a 65” LG in the den and it’s perfect and a 50” in my kids room and no issues at all.  Took about 30 min and most of that was just measuring and leveling.,5,1,2018-12-19,1,0,0
"Have bought a lot of DIY items/furniture etc in past, but never came across a product that packed screws, nuts, and other parts so well. Usually everyone just keeps small objects together leaving customer to identify which item is F (for example) to use in which step.Here smallest items were packed and marked separately that makes following instructions a breeze.",5,1,2019-4-30,1,0,0
"Cheap, looks good, does the job. Shop at your local stores and then come back here. Lowes wants like 60 bucks for larger mounts or more.I just wanted a tilt mount. Comes w/ a level and a hdmi cord if you need one. Super quick to pull the tv off the mount if needed. I actually wall mounted every room with these mounts. No issues.",5,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"The quick and easy nature of the mounting was the best part.Overall, the instructions were straight forward, but I had to read them multiple times to translate what was being said. But, after a bit of playing with the parts and brackets it made sense.",4,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
Be sure to measure the space on the TV for the bars (hooks). This product did not work. We now have a mount on the wall with no TV to put on it. The middle bar/plate was too wide and did not align with our TV. It would have been nice to have seen this measurement in the description.,1,1,2020-9-14,1,0,1
"Great value and good quality.  The kit came with everything you need, including an HDMI cable, level, different length and size screws for your TV.  Ideal for smaller TV's 32"" to 52"".  The wall mount plate spans exactly 16"" which is your standard distance between two 2x4 studs inside your drywall.  You have up to 8"" offset from the center of wall mount plate, which mean you can slide your TV up to 8"" to the left or right of the wall plate.  This is because the wall plate have to be secured to the two 2x4 studs inside the dry wall, and you can slide the TV to the left or right to position it relative to the rest of the wall.",5,1,2017-1-24,1,1,0
So as far as this thing goes it hasn’t sent my 65” plummeting to a bitter end. We’ve had it up for a few days now. It came in as expected and you just need to be mindful of where your studs are placed in the wall. For me set up was easy as I have a man at home who did that for me. All in all it appears to be doing its job.,5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"This mount is awesome and works with most TV's! I say MOST because I bought a few of these mounts and didn't realize the VESA on one of the TV's was a bit narrower than this mount allows, so we had to use a different one for that. All of the other TV's we have work great with this mount and it was very simple to install. Great value for a great item - definitely recommend!",5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
Hung up 36' TV with no problem very easy to install.  However it has bottom pull tabs so the supports click into the rail.  Mine do not click in at its full angle down like seen in the picture supplied by amazon.  The weight of the TV keeps it in place.  The pull tabs also hang below the TV so I cut them off.  The price is right and the product will work however the bottom tabs for me do not lock in.,4,1,2018-4-9,1,1,0
"I was hesitant to order these because of the low price. After seeing many mounts in stores for a lot more I decided to throw caution to the wind and give them a try. I ordered two of these for two different types of televisions I own. Both of the TVs are 55"" and are different mounting configurations. These mounts are inexpensive, well built, easy to install (use your own level!), and support a wide range of configurations. I am very happy with this item and will certainly purchase this type of mount again.",5,1,2017-6-17,1,1,0
"I loved this product, the ease of installation and the fact that they include a wide variety of mount spacers. You would think Samsung would include them since most people mount their TV's now a days but nope so I would have had to order a special kit from them but because this mount contained many spacers I was able to put something together that worked perfectly and saved me the time and effort. It also comes with a level. I would purchase again.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"Worked perfectly for my 50"" TCL Roku TV. i mounted this above a fireplace where there was a stud one 1 inch left of center with the other two studs 24"" from center. 1992 house so of course. Fortunately, the TV weighed less than 25 pounds plus the one stud was plenty. For the heck of it, I put two half decent drywall anchors opposite the stud side...completely unnecessary, but it made me feel better.",5,1,2019-5-27,1,0,0
"The setup was very straight forward. The quality of the wall bracket and the hardware included to mount the ""arms"" to the TV are good quality. I had to make a few adjustments with spacers and such, but that is mentioned in the instructions. I was missing a couple of M8 screws but Michael from customer service was great, he shipped them on the same day and I got them the day after.  You also have to consider the price for this bracket which is really nice. Better, and a cheaper than the ones you could find at Costco or Walmart.",5,1,2019-5-28,1,0,0
"Not the easiest to install, but for the price it’s great. There are several of these with the same design just different brands and they all work fine just depends on how much you want to pay. It carries our 65in tv. 3 weeks in and no issues, also the “tilt” is worthless. No difference there. If you want movement get the swivel.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"I'm not sure whether to give a bad review to this mount or to the friend who helped me install it. He kept muttering the whole time (from the moment he saw the picture on the box) that it was a stupid design and obsolete and why did I order this one when there are better modern ones and ""they stopped making these years ago"". He nonetheless got it installed (with more muttering) and it seems to work fine. I've looked over the installation directions myself and they don't really make a lot of sense to me, so maybe my friend was right that it's a bad design (I certainly wouldn't have been able to install it myself). But as long as it works, I can't give it fewer stars. Just beware that if you're not mechanical, you might have trouble with the installation.",4,1,2016-5-23,1,0,0
"Got this for a 50’ Samsung. Fit great and installation was pretty easy. All the hardware you need is included and then some! Just figure out which size screws/ washers you need to mount the rails to your tv and your good to go. Locating the studs to mount the wall bracket was probably the longest part of the installation. That was due to multiple measure/remeasures on my part just to be sure I hit studs on both sides! Having a stud finder comes in handy. Once the wall brackets up, mounting the tv is simple.Instructions were pretty straight forward, everything you need hardware wise is included and the price was great! I would definitely order again if I’m looking to wall mount another tv.",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"Snagged a Walmart black Friday TV deal only to find that a mount would cost me  $75!  Screw that.  So I copped this baby from Amazon.  Works great.  I don't know why anyone would pay up to $75 for a TV mount when this one is available.  This one is very intuitive to install and use.  TV comes off the wall in an instant by pulling on the fabric loops.  Also slides horizontally about 6 inches either way while mounted, which for me is a desirable thing.  Adjusting the tilt is easy - take it off the wall mount as mentioned earlier and adjust some hew-head screws.The fact that you get a bubble level and a 6-foot HDMI cable included for $16 is amazing - you can pay $16 for just the cable!",5,1,2016-12-3,1,0,0
"Excellent mount, purchased a 70 inch Samsung tv and I was afraid that it wouldn’t be strong enough to support it but it is very sturdy, paired this mount up with a stud finder I also purchased from amazon and this was easy comes with all the hardware you’ll ever need. Easy fast and amazing",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,1
"The hardest part of installing my 50"" Vizio using this was finding 2 studs to support it, since I have an older house and the stud width isn't consistent or standard.  Part of this frame bolts to the wall, in the studs, and the front part goes on the back of the TV.  I am glad that we went ahead and attached the HDMI cable that was sent- we have used it several times since.There are two loops that are used when the TV is lifted into place. Pulling on them opens then clamps the front part of the mount with the TV onto the wall.",5,1,2016-6-7,1,1,0
"Wall mount worked perfectly. It is very universal, and i was able to hang my 65” LG OLED in about 20 min. It came with an hdmi cable which is nice. I have hung numerous TVs now and this mount has to be one of the easiest due to the flexibility of the mount. The directions are a little confusing but once i got the mounting bracket up, I stopped reading. Great Mount! Unbeatable price!",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"I bought this tv mount thinking it would he sturdy. It holds the TV up, but it definitely seems like it's on the cheaper side. Also, it has straps in the back that hang down to help it latch to the bracket and they're a pain to try and hide once the tv is up. Seems like a poor design, but it hangs the TV.",4,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"This was easy to install. The directions are clear and easy to follow. The components and pieces are individually sealed and numbered to the directions, again easy to get right. The mount is solid, stable and secure.Measure the placement, i.e. height and centering before mounting the bracket to the wall. This sysyem made hanging the TV simple and safe.",5,1,2019-9-19,1,0,1
I like how the instructions are easy to understand but I wish that it was easier to attach through the wall I'm 5 2 102 lb yeah I had to ask my friend to help me install it it took about 25 minutes but I was pleasantly surprised with all the tools that it came with came with a level a HDMI cord and a lot of other tools it was really awesome for the price I paid for it,4,1,2019-12-9,1,0,1
"Mine is currently hold up a 50"" sharp in the shop.. no problems installing it..Only bad is this... if you have to remove the tv from the mount i hope you have small hands so you can get to the spring loaded release springs..  besides that a good unit overall",5,1,2018-7-23,1,0,0
"Ease of installation, directions well written. The mount is level; once we mounted the tv, the tv is not level. I will have to re-adjust by placing something under one of the hooks to level. I am not sure why tv is not level when mount is; perhaps the hooks aren’t machined even or maybe where they (supports) attach to tv aren’t even.Very sturdy mount and great price.",4,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0
"The install was breeze. When they say it does 24 stud spacing, they weren’t kidding, not a 1/4 inch to spare, it barely makes the spread, but worked great.Came with a level that isn’t level, used my own for quality.....",5,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
"Easy step by step instructions, super universal for all sorts of TVs. We have a 65” and it held it perfectly. Once you mount the back, you just screw the clips onto the tv and click it into place. It came with a nice, long extended HDMI cord and a small leveler. Highly recommend.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"This is by far the best tv mount I have ever purchased.  Comes assembled.  The wall bracket is a one piece design (very strong) and the pull latches work perfectly.  I've probably purchased 20 or more of these cheaper mounts on Amazon and this Mounting Dream Bracket is perfect.  I love how stiff the tilt is.  I wanted my tv parallel with the wall and some of the other mounts dont stop the tilt as well.  47"" LG LED mounted.",5,1,2016-7-24,1,4,1
"This was very easy to install. My husband did it in about less than 45 minutes. It tilts foward, which is great for vision sometimes. I get glares through the windows and that tilt helps a lot. There’s straps to help with quick removal for clean root accessing the back of the tv and remount is just a quick snap.",5,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
This product is awesome. It comes with a little love it took us about 10 minutes to hang it in drywall and then hook the TV to it have all the wires hidden just awesome to have it holds a 52 anti Super HD TV I recommend this hanging your TV on the wall it goes great with the shelves that I put on it. I highly recommend this product.,5,1,2016-9-24,1,4,0
"This worked well for our Vizio 55"" tv.  The attachment was easy with a proper stud finder.  I was unable to find a stud for one location, so I only have 3 screws in the wall, and it is still holding up well.  (Not saying that is ideal, just that it did work. It will reduce the capacity that way.)All in all, very pleased with this purchase.",5,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0
"I rarely if ever give 5 star reviews however I was so pleased with the quality and ease of installation I will here. I will have to say however that I’m using the mount only in the vertical position so I can’t judge it’s tilt performance. I mounted a 60” LG and this mount and hardware fit perfectly. I used 5 lag bolts to anchor to 2x4” studs and it is rock solid and level thanks to the wall brackets one piece design. I wouldn’t mess around with the 2 piece brackets many other sellers offer, no way.",5,1,2019-3-3,1,1,0
"I had to mount a 50"" Samsung TV to the wall and this mount did the trick. The build quality of the mount is good and it is sturdy. The mount comes with detailed clear instructions as well as screws and spacers for different TV's but I recommend that you use the spacers that come with your TV. I did have to use some of the small spacers in the kit to properly secure the screws into the TV. I have some additional TV's to mount and I will be purchasing more of the MD products.",5,1,2019-8-11,1,0,1
The tilting mounts like this where you clip the tv the top are simply the best. It makes it easy to move sideways if you didn’t measure the spot you wanted it perfectly and you can also take the tv on and off pretty easily.

"Very easy to install.  Be aware of how far apart your studs are so that you get the right bracket.  Mine were a perfect width.  Use a good level to make sure you have it straight.  It does come with a little one but I think it's better to have a large one to get it perfect.  Holds my 43"" TCL TV without any issue.",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
I bought thi to mount my new 65” tv to the wall. The instructions were great and the mounting was straight forward. The instructions say to basically hang in. It after you mount it to the wall. I hung on it with almost all of my 180 pounds and it did not budge. I am confident that my tv will be safe with this mount.,5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"Great Wall mount! Very strong, I can hang from it.  This is the fourth one I have purchased. Easy to install and does not need to be exactly centered behind the television. This is handy due to fact that the studs may not land perfectly, so you can still center the TV on the wall. We have a 65”, 58”, 55” and a 44” mounted using this system. I love it. It tilts forward so you can mount up high. The only conn is the mount does not swivel side to side. Mounting Dream does offer a model that does for a few dollars more. I will soon be adding one to our game room. I presume it will be of equal quality. I will leave a post once it is installed.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"I bought this to hold a 55"" and it does do it, however the mount is low profile so we had to shim the wall so our accessories cords could plug into the tv. It also tilts about 8 degrees downward if you want but no more.  If you are looking for a mount that is simple and does the job this is it.  If you are looking for options and to hold a lot of weight keep looking.",3,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0
"This TV mounting bracket is great! Very easy to install and use.  The only drawback is that it does only allows for a small range of adjustments in TV Up/down angle.  No left/right adjustment.  Perfect for locations (bedroom, corner) that don't require any other little movement.  I highly recommend this.",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
I bought this to hang up my mom's TV on her wall. It looks like the easiest item to purchase because it actually has hooks that you hang on to the brackets that you screw into the wall. I had my husband and still listen to a while since he's installed other ones in our own home. It took him about 15 or so minutes to get this TV hooked onto the wall and ready working. If they have others for larger TVs I may look into purchasing one in the future since I'm planning on purchasing the 70 inch. I would definitely buy this specific brand to hang up again. This does not move around so you can't pull it from the wall and turn it from side to side is a straight on up to the wall.,5,1,2016-9-26,1,0,0
"For what I paid I got way more than I bargained for. Do not think twice about this, it was a perfect match for our 50"" LED TV.

The HDMI cable was awesome too.",5,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"Good mount BUT the level that comes along with the mount is really bad. When installing the mount the level showed it was fine, once I finished something looked off.

Seller shouldn't send these horrible levels with their product.",4,1,2019-8-3,1,0,0

"Amazing for the price. I mounted my 42in flat screen plasma tv. Install was easy and basic, mounts fit my tv and the free level was a bonus but I had my own. A tip for the less experinced, mount the arms on your tv and measure to make sure you place your wall mounting bracket low enough from your celling so you can still fit the tv on the bracket. Kit has an assortment of other screws and bolts for various brands and models of tv. The tilt on the bracket was just enough to be comfortable for me.

"Okay yeah, it’s a wall mount, nothing special does the job. Where this stands out is the package. Not only do they include a braided hdmi cable and level, the bags of parts are not only separated.... there freaking COLOR CODED! Here’s the kicker, they put a metric/imperial ruler on the box. I know it sounds trivial, but as a consumer, these small attentions to detail and consideration tells me this manufacturer cares because the only thing better than the product itself, is the bargain. Kudos to everyone involved. No hyperbole.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0

There is about 1.5 inches of space behind the mount so nobody can get their hand behind there to plug something in. I will be returning this and never buy a mount like this again.

Love the quality and I’m all about quality  especially for the price! I saw mounts at this retail store that I’m not going to mention but the prices are way over 100$ for junk and this is well cheaper price and a higher quality.

Very good product at a good price.As others noted, the included level is not super accurate, so I’d recommend using another.",5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
This mount is really well built and incredibly sturdy. I was very impressed and surprised at how strong/tough it feels. If you just need a mount that will angle your TV down a hair (8 degrees) then this is the one! Easy to set up and install.Since I mounted over a fire place (use to be wood burning) I used used two 2x4's that extended to the sides where studs were. Then I drilled the TV mount in to the 2x4's. I have done this before and it is very sturdy. Fairly certain I could hang from it and it wont be coming out of the wall.,5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,1
"Rated for TV's up to 70"" I bought this to mount an older 46"" plasma screen. The mount frame was 2"" too narrow for the space between attachment points on the TV. To use it I had to mount the halves of the frame separately. It works, but I wouldn't have bought it if I'd known this in advance.",4,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"I had been wanting to mount our TV on the wall for quite some time, but the husband didn't want to. After installing one for our daughter, he decided it wasn't such a bad idea. He mounted this on the wall with no issues. We've had it up for several weeks now and the TV hasn't fallen down, so...I'd say it's a pretty sturdy product. :-)",5,1,2019-8-6,1,0,0
"Sturdy and easy to follow installation directions.  Mounted a 55in LG with no issues.  The release pulls do hang below the bottom of the television, so I just taped them to the back of the tv.  Happy with the purchase and would buy it again if we mount any other TVs in our house.",5,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
Not bad for $40. Compared to the $120 bestbuy and Walmart wanted. I bought a 75” tv and had few options. The metal plate that bolts on the wall good quality. The hooks that go on the back of the TV. Not a fan. Look and feel cheap. And the “tilt function” is a pain. You have to use an Allen wrench to adjust it. Would rather thumb screws.,3,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
Imounted mines on a concrete and brick wall the company will send you the anchor separately once requested Instead of waiting I went to the local true value snd purchased some lead concrete anchors1/2 inch for the 1/2inch screws provided because with older construction the blue self anchor screws can loosen up and drop your tv,5,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0
"The mount feels more than capable of holding the TV I have on it, so it definitely wins studies points. The instructions were easy to follow and now that it’s up I am very happy with it.Adjusting the angle is a bit of a pain and difficult to do if it is already mounted. It’s possible but requires two people. One to tilt to desired angle, and the other to loosen then tighten the screws.",3,1,2019-5-12,1,0,1
Perfect fit for a 55 in tv. Comes with a blueprint for the wall to help mark your anchor locations without scratching up the paint. Also included a variety of spacers and lengths/sizes of bolts if you wanted more distance from the wall. The extra HDMI cord and level are nice bonuses. Took about 20 minutes to assemble and mount.,5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"Mount went in easy, and  works well! It stretched to reach 2 studs (My house is 24"" studs) But it fit right, and I had a little room to slide my TV back and forth to find the right fit. If your studs are off center of the wall you expect to hang the TV on, I would suggest buying the longer version to give yourself a little more flexibility on where to hang the TV, but for me it worked fine since my studs were centered on the wall. The level is nice because one side of it is a magnet, so it stuck to the wall plate while I mounted it to the wall. Made leveling the plate a breeze!",5,1,2019-1-23,1,0,0
Came fast and looks great on the wall. Wish it would tilt more and move around but it’s ok. Came with a long hdmi cord which is great and all the tools although I didn’t use them all as you don’t have too. Would recommend. The screws that drill on the wall are huge and I only used 2 instead of 4 because it’s very sturdy so no need to make 4 holes in the wall.,4,1,2020-7-14,1,1,0
Had two buy a second one since the first one proved to be great. One is holding a 65 inch samsung and the other one a 50 inch all tools needed to install all i needed was a drill. Came with level and confident tv will not fall. Came with hdmi cable too. Price was very affordable 👌,5,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
This is very easy to install with all the mounting hardware included! Very durable with a simplistic design that really works well for a great value! My favourite feature is the ease in which you can mount & remove the Television from the wall simply by pulling the two levees & lifting!,5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,1
"For the price, this is an excellent product. The most time consuming part of this was measuring everything out to fit onto the wall correctly. Easy to install, comes with many varying screws, spacers and pieces to make it fit correctly, a small level and an HDMI cable and easy to read instructions. I would highly recommend this product - just make sure to learn about what VESA spacing is on your TV so that you don't miss the marks/space in back of your TV with the pre-drilled holes.",5,1,2018-4-13,1,0,0
"I have purchased numerous TV mounts over the years, purchasing several articulating mounts and never using them.  This mount is both practical in form and cost.  It really exceeded my expectation as to its quality.  I would recommend this mount to anyone.  It can fit a 16"" center or 24"" center, it comes with a level, HDMI cable and two Velcro cord wraps.  It is simply an excellent product.  Don't ignore this mount due to its low price, just the opposite, buy it before it increases in price.",5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
Great product and very easy to assemble. It was a little difficult to adjust the angle and secure the screws once it was on the wall. I don’t know how we would have done that if we didn’t use the spacers to add some space between the wall and tv. But it’s up and sturdy and looks great. Would definitely recommend.,5,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
Great tv mount. I had a handy man mount it for me for my 52 inch tv. The company was great about answering questions and helping me pick the exact one I needed for my specific television.

This is pretty nice but I wish I would have noticed that you can't slide the hooks all the way across the top. I needed about a 1/4 of an inch and my tv would have been centered but with that bar in the center I can't push it over any more. It's not entirely the mounts fault because the wall I hung it on is narrow and only had 3 studs in it so I placed it way off to one side. I would still buy this again if I ever needed another one.,4,1,2018-9-14,1,0,0
"This tilting TV wall mount works as described. It comes with all the screws you could ever need and a pretty nice level. The lag screws to screw into the studs seem pretty good quality as does the mount itself. One thing I kind of like is when you hang your TV on the mount, because it doesn't use clamping screws to attach the TV bracket to the wall mount,  you can slide the TV back and forth on the mount to center it in your wall space. I wasn't expecting that.",5,1,2018-12-15,1,0,0
"Bought this product to hang my new 55"" Samsung.  I was replacing an older model 55"" tv...so I didnt have to hang brackets to the wall...I used the existing one.

Super sturdy and tilt action gives u the ability to angle the tv to the optimum position.",5,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
Holds our 51 inch in the master bedroom. Took about 5 minutes to put up and was easy to install. Definitely sturdy! Only get this if you’re not planning on moving the tv once up.

"I used this mount to hang our 75"" Samsung RU8000.  It assembles easy and all hardware to attach it to the TV and wall is included.

The spacers and fasteners to the TV worked out great and it made for a great looking installation.",5,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0
This was one of the best purchases! I didn’t know tv mounts didn’t cost $100. I also didn’t know how awesome it feels to install your own tv mount. The tv looks great mounted! Were able to do the install ourselves but I think people should know that your gonna need tools for this. One of the things we didn’t have was ratchet. The drill wasn’t enough to screw down the bolts. Thankfully a neighbor lent me his. The instructions were easy to follow and I was impressed by all you get with the kit. I would certainly recommend to anybody,5,1,2018-3-6,1,0,0
"This system is easy to install. However, if you want to adjust tilt you need to do it with the tv off the wall and tighten the screws, then put the tv back on the wall. If it is not correct, you have to remove it and readjust.",4,1,2020-6-8,1,1,0
Choose this mount! I purchased the mount that only tilts. HDMI cable as a bonus! All included hardware and spacers.This mount comes in two pieces. Don’t let that deter you. Simply attach the two pieces together with the provided screws. (you need a screw driver). I hung a “55 vizio and looks great and very close to the wall. Half the price of what you pay for at any local big box store that does the exact same thing. I will be buying another one soon for the guest bedroom.,5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
Works awesome. Just wish it was a little wider so you had a little more play when trying to hook the tv onto the wall. You have to have everything lined up perfectly for it to fit. You may have 1/2” on either side once the tv brackets are mounted to the wall bracket. That makes it tough when you are lining it up.,5,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
This is a great bang for your buck. I’ve installed 30+ TVs on walls and this mount works well. I took one star off because I don’t like how you need to assemble the 2 halves. That being said they go together easily and I had no issues mounting the tv perfectly level. I would recommend using your own level as often these cheap levels that are provided don’t work well and are not accurate,4,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0

"Installed tv with maximum tilt, didn't like the viewing angle and decided to readjust.  Couldn't get the tilt adjustment screw to loosen, those screws were made of soft metal and the screw became useless as the head of the Allen screw got stripped in the process, ended up punching the screw, wasted lot of time. By the way I didnt use any power tools on the allen screw, simply used the supplied Allen tool.",1,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"Easy install, works well. Purchased two of them for a 60” and 70” tvs. Been over a month and they’re are still on the wall! Worth the few days of shipping if you’re not in a rush. These are a fraction of the cost of in store mounts. They work just as well!",5,1,2020-3-29,1,0,0
"Unfortunately, whoever designed this does not realize that if a stud lies directly in the center of the wall you want to mount it on and your studs are 24"" apart instead of 18"" apart, then you cannot mount your TV directly in the middle of the wall.

"Finally got our first big flat screen smart TV.  Mounting was way too easy.  Whatever you do get, get a mount that tilts slightly if you're mounting up on the wall so the picture points more toward your eyes.  This is solid - no fear of my beautiful new TV falling off the wall.  Was tempted to get a swivel mount, but seriously, when would I ever really need to do that?  Love that this is as flush to the wall as can realistically get - TV blends in more like a picture frame than a honking tech monstrosity.",5,1,2019-9-8,1,0,0
"It doesn't have a lot of the features of high end mounts, but this works great in my apartment. The hardware is sturdy and well made.

I suppose I will keep the extra hardware for when I buy a new TV and it may mount differently.",5,1,2019-8-14,1,0,0
The mount worked fine but the brace in the middle is pretty wide and sticks up slightly making it impossible to attach if the stud is directly in the center.  Also where the brace sticks up it won't allow the use of a 2ft level.  It did come with a small level but I never trust a free 6 inch level,4,1,2020-9-19,1,0,1
"I got almost entirely through my installation process before realizing that I absolutely had to have a torque wrench in order to finish installation. There's simply no other option. Now I'm stuck here with a half installed mount in my wall and need to wait until tomorrow until I can go buy a torque wrench, which will probably cost the same as the entire mount itself. It seems like the mount will be good once installed but, if you don't own a torque wrench already , buy a different mount as you'll be spending twice the price of this mount just to get the thing installed. I'd return it if it wasn't such a hassle.",2,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"This was the first TV wall mount that I installed.  The directions were good. I'm am pretty handy.  For a non-handy person, following the instructions should still be fairly simple. I really like how the TV floats horizontally on the wall mount, so after installed, you can slide left-to-right to center it.  We centered ours over our dresser in our bedroom. The best part is the price - great value.  I would have given 5 stars but adjusting the tilt angle is a pain.  You have to take the TV on and off the wall (trial and error) to get correct angle.",4,1,2017-5-31,1,0,0
"I prefer this design over the swing arm design for larger screens.  I used this for a 50"" Samsung.  Just understand that the wall bracket is less than 16"" long so I was only able to put one side into a wall stud.  I used 60lb drywall anchors for the non-stud side.  This comes with a small level to make proper installation a snap.  Super solid and stable and the straps have adjustable length.  Easy quick installation just find a wall stud.",4,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0

"I'd describe my DIY abilities as ""adequate"" I managed to successfully put it all together on my own but I didn't realized that it didn't come with the screws for brick walls.

This is my go to for a basic TV wall mount.  I've installed a hand full of these now.  While it does come with its own tiny level I always pitch that directly into the trash.  I've checked 3 of the provided levels against my Empire magnetic torpedo and all 3 were off the bubble by varying amounts.  I would rate this 5 stars if they would get rid of the level and tell the consumer to use their own.  I feel a lot of unnecessary frustration could be eliminated this way.,4,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0

"The construction of the metal seems sturdy enough. The issue I have is that the holes are designed for a maximum of 16"" studs.  If your studs are slightly closer together, that is fine.  However, if your studs are slightly wider apart (which mine are) you won't be able to get the center of the studs. That is what I had to do, which is a bit scary. If they would make the mount a little wider to give some margin of error say 15-17"" this would get 5 stars.  The level is a bonus, but it doesn't work very well. The margin markers are much wider than the bubble width, so you can't really get an exact level. They offer a wide variety of screws to match the one your tv needs, which is great. However, in my sealed package, they accidentally gave me 3 of the screws I needed, instead of 4. I contacted the seller, and will see what they say.Conclusion: I bought this for around $16 which is great.  Construction seems decent. So if your studs are exactly 16"" apart (or less), this will work fine for you. Otherwise, you should probably get something else.",2,1,2017-6-21,1,1,0

"The worry with a TV mount, of course, is that it's not going to hold and your super fancy giant TV will come tumbling to the ground. I do not have that worry at all with this product! It was easy to install and feels incredibly solid. The way it's designed makes it able to accommodate just about any TV size, and the slide-able rack means even if you don't center the mount perfectly, you can make slight adjustments. One of the best parts is how easy it is to take the TV on and off of the mount to make little adjustments as necessary. Overall very solid product.",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"Wanted to mount my TV so got rid of my stand, built this fireplace and FINALLY was able to put the tv up! Simple instructions, even a girl can hang this system 😉.Update: it’s been up for almost 2 months, no issues at all! For the price, you cannot go wrong!",5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,1
I have been extremely impressed with this system. Comes with everything needed to mount a tv. Will not swivel from left to right but if you’re just looking for something to put out in front of your bed or man room this is great. Would absolutely buy again,5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0

The mount is solid and is very flexible as far as getting it to line up with the studs 16"" on center.

"I am very impressed by the quality of this TV mount and the careful, considerate and amazing packaging! First, the quality of the mount itself is very good and the design is very sturdy, I had no concern about hanging my 60” TV on it. The packaging is great, clear instructions, everything is labeled, and all screws and mounting hardware are individually bagged and labeled.

"I had no probably getting it attached to the wall and actually getting my 55 in TV, i was even able to all of this by myself. The only part that i found to be somewhat annoying is when i was trying to replug in all the cords. But that might just be the price you have to pay to get something that sits very close to the wall. The tilting is also a nice feature.",4,1,2018-10-30,1,0,0
Easy to install and plenty of screws to choose from for the brackets that attach to the tv. All parts are very well made. Great product. It's much easier to install with two people. I used a long level to draw the horizontal and vertical lines. Then used the small level when making the drill marks. Very easy to do when one person holds the wall bracket and the other person makes the drill marks. I strongly suggest that you start drilling the holes with a small drill bit just in case the stud isn't where you thought it was. Once you hit wood use the correct drill bit to accomidate the anchor screws.,5,1,2016-8-19,1,0,0
I was nervous getting this mount because I thought the price was too good to be true! That is definitely not the case! This mount is perfect and I can’t believe I almost spent $100 at another store.My one piece of advice would be to take advantage of the multiple spacers that the unit comes with so that the TV doesn’t sit super close to the wall making it hard to connect cords (I have an older bulky tv so this shouldn’t be an issue with newer TVs),5,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"So happy.  This is my 4th TV mount, 1st one from Mounting Dream.  Our TV is an older flat screen, thick and heavy.  I was worried about the huge vesa configuration and wall stud locations wouldn't line up.  This unit is great because it gives you extra room on both to give you a proper fit.  Worked awesome.  Install was easy, the bolts and screws are all separated and labeled.  Stellar unit, great quality.  Loved the little level that was included, too.",5,1,2018-3-28,1,0,1
"I am honestly astounded by the quality of this product and the extras that this came with. It comes with an hdmi cable, leveler, all the hardware and spacers you can use etc. And at this price, you simply cannot beat it.

Well built and sturdy. Current holding up my 58 inch tv. To release tv from mount it has 2 small chords that you pull to detach tv from mount. Mount has just enough tilt so you can get that perfect viewing angle. This is my second Mount dream purchase. Recommend,5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,1
"I put off trying to install this mount for weeks. But once I did install it, I couldn't believe how easy it was.

"I used their level and mounted the top two screws only to realize it was completely wrong. I got another level and compared it was far off. I had to unscrew the large wall screws and move the mount down an inch to get a different secure hold. I now have two extra holes in my wall. The attached picture is their level on top which is saying its level; the one below, which is accurate, is clearly not level.The mount otherwise seems sturdy and easy to assemble. I would have rather they didnt throw in cheap level to give the impression it's everything you need in one kit. A couple degrees on the mount will be very obvious, especially on larger TVs.",3,1,2018-9-30,1,0,1
"I just mounted a 32"" tv with this and the rails that mount on the back of the TV went from the very top of the TV to the very bottom of the TV. On a smaller 26"" TV they would have been sticking out from behind the TV.  ALSO, the TV has to be hung on the mount with out tilting it out in order to get the locks to click into place. THEN once it is locked onto the wall plate you can loosen the tilt screws and adjust it out. LAST is the tilting AMOUNT. It says tilting but doesnt say how far it tilts. It does tilt out at the top, but only 3 or 4 inches",4,1,2016-12-7,1,0,0

I really wanted a nearly flush mount. This is as close as possible. But be careful what you wish for. Super difficult to get everything plugged in without three people. Two to hold it up and another to plug wires. But now that it’s up I love it.,5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"Overall a good product. Easy to assemble and mounting would be easy on walls with standard stud spacing. Unfortunately, my fireplace did not have standard stud spacing so I had to attach the mount to a board and attach the board to the wall. The spring loaded clips that secure the TV to the bracket have straps on them to allow one to pull the straps and release the TV. For larger TV's mounted close to a mantel the straps are a little short. Best to make sure the bottom of the TV is mounted 6 to 8 inches above a mantel or shelf.",4,1,2019-3-17,1,0,0

Extremely easy to install.  Well designed. Fasteners were perfectly sized to match bushings for our tv. Instructions were clear and consistent. Heavy stamped structure with few if any sharp burrs.

Came with extra screws to fit any tv, but mine were easy to pick out and fit perfectly.  The wall bracket installed simply between 2 wall studs 15"" apart.  I liked that it reached the studs for the width making it very secure, and it's not so high on my tv that it shows over the top.  I had help from a friend hanging it on the wall plate, but probly could have done it myself.  I liked it so much I ordered a 2nd for my 40"" tv.  Just enough tilt for good viewing while sitting.

He commented that it was sturdier than other models he’s seen, because it braces below the top of the doorway on one side and above on the other, vs. just hanging onto the top on either side. He’s over 200 pounds and was giving it a good test run already, so I’m confident it will hold up well and be well worth the price.",5,1,2018-12-26,1,0,1

I have 3 of these, on for my 40"" in the bedroom, one for my 49"" in the game room and one (yet to be mounted) for my 65"" in the theater room.

This is the standard. However my walls had 24"" stud spacing. The solution was to get a piece of ply that could span the 24"" stud distance, screw the mount to that and then mount the ply to the wall. This worked out fine for me, and may have to be your solution as well if your studs are not the standard 16"" distance.And no, you cannot use drywall anchors, unless you want the TV to eventually rip off the walls.",4,1,2015-9-15,1,0,0

"While this was a great deal and the product is made of high quality materials, I unfortunately can't use this TV mount.  As this mount must be mounted directly into studs, you are limited to 16 inches and this item then has no room to adjust the centering position of the TV when mounted on the wall.  Lining this mount up to the studs on the wall does not allow the TV to be centered on my wall due to where the studs are inside my wall.  I would suggest finding a TV wall mount that is 20+ inches wide or wider, so you can adjust centering of where the TV ends up.

Very sturdy and inexpensive. The 10 degree tilt down is limited. It works great for a TV at eye level to cut down on a bit of reflection but wasn't enough to direct a TV hung above the fireplace down to couch level.

"The connection arms are way longer than they need to be so on a 32"" LCD they are almost visible extruding past the top or bottom.  Good otherwise easy to install and when attached to the wall studs works like a charm - easy",4,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"This wall mount is nice and sturdy. It comes with the best setup of hardware I've ever seen.  All of the screws, washers, level, etc. are in individual labeled pouches! How cool is that!!  All I needed was a drill, drill bit, and philips head screwdriver. This was so easy to install.  The only issue I had with this mount was the method for adjusting the angle. After I installed my 55"" 89LB TV  I couldn't access the allen wrench screws to adjust the angle. I have to take my TV off the mount to adjust the angle, and since it's 89lbs I won't be taking it off.  If you want an angle,  make your adjustments first.",4,1,2016-4-14,1,0,0
"Just like editing the registry in windows, install this yourself at your own risk!I installed these myself (bought 2), have had no issues in the two years they’ve been in use. Sturdy, fits cleanly behind the tv, just does its damn job. Love it. We used these on two 50” Sharp 4K Roku TVs that we’re a Best Buy doorbuster 2 Black is Fridays ago.",5,1,2019-3-24,1,0,0
I had to send this back because although it said it fit all 65 inch TVs the mounting brackets that go on the back of the TV are too short for the pre-drilled holes. Be sure to measure before ordering,3,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"It was incredibly difficult to install. I had to have two people to help me figure out the instructions and then to mount it evenly on the wall (still a little crooked though but meh). However, it is holding up my tv well. Once you do it once it's easier the second time around. I like how it came with a level as well.",4,1,2019-5-23,1,0,0
"Great mount for the price, seriously! I was shopping around for different mounts, most starting close to $80 or they seemed cheap. This one was the perfect price and is very sturdy. I could easily dangle from it (having mounted it using studs) and I am more than confident that it's not going anywhere. It doesn't rotate, and it can only tilt just a bit using a couple screws. If you aren't needing a mount that has rotation or quite a bit of tilt, you just found it.",4,1,2019-1-27,1,0,0
"It was very easy to install on my wall using the studs. The best part of it is when you putting TV on the mount. Basically, my son and I pick up the TV and just put in on the slides. It's also easy to remove the TV.",5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"My second one. I bought the first for the television in my guest bedroom. It was so easy to install and looks so good on the wall, I bought this second one for my room. I did go to the expense of having the electrical and cable outlets relocated, but it was well worth it. I am very pleased having my television on the wall opposite the bed. It makes for easy night time viewing before falling asleep.",5,1,2018-4-22,1,0,0
"It is what it is. For the price you cant be too mad. The left side spring loaded latching device is too wide, or the frame in which it sits too narrow, preventing it from reaching its full range of travel and locking onto the frame.",3,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
Strong mount. Holding my 60in tv without issues. The pull tabs on the back have a nylon strip that you pull to open the bottom of the bracket to mount the tv. They are a pain in the butt to reach when the tv is on the wall because the offset if not very far from the wall. Had to hide the strips when the tv is up.,4,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"I had it put together by the BF. When I opened the box it was scary the number of parts. So many screws but fear not, you will not need all the screws. You will only need a few for your tv. Worked great, tv is up and looks great.",5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"I purchased this wall mount because of it's close distance between the TV and wall. For my application it was perfect: TV in a built-in wall cabinet with hinged doors. I have plenty of clearance to open and close the doors with the ability to allow the TV to tilt slightly down-ward. I was initially skeptical of the two-piece bracket, but after constructing it, the bracket felt very firm. Attaching the mount to the back of the TV was painless. The addition of an HDMI cable and level were nice, but not necessary in my application. I would give this wall mount 5 stars if the tilting mechanism was easier to access, but this seems to be a typical issue with low-cost TV mounts. One other nit-pick, the quick-release pulls show below the TV, but this can easily be remedied with two piece of tape.  For the price-point, I will be buying additional Mounting Dream wall mounts for additional TVs in our home.",4,1,2016-10-31,1,1,0
"For such an inexpensive wall mount I am pleasantly surprised and how stable it is! We have a 55” tv and needed to use the wider spacers to allow it to tilt down, but that was a TV issue, not the mount. The mount itself is extremely light and I was able to hold it up, make sure it was level, mark it all up and drill all by myself. Doesn’t feel cheap at all.",5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,1
Had my tech from work come install it and hang the TV (he’s hung several TVs for me over the years) he said this one had a lot of parts and wasn’t the easiest one he’s had to assemble- it took him a little linger but he finally got it,4,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"Awesome product.  I have a 55 inch sharp that i used with this wall mount.  Fit perfect to TV and holds to the wall studs with heavy duty lag screws.  Only issue i had with this item was since it is a slim wall mount and my TV being 55 in, was a little bit of a task getting my hands to the back of the tv to connect wires or pull the safety latches to remove/mount tv from the mount, didnt think about that before i bought it.  But i do like that it doesnt stick out that far from wall, witch was my ultimate goal.  Little bit of enginuity will do the trick or just have smaller hands.",5,1,2017-12-16,1,0,0
"A bit cumbersome to install. But holds our tv well. A small level is provided, but you may want a bigger one. I needed to bring in an extra set of hands. Would suggest hooking up all your components before hanging tv on the wall... not a lot of space to fit your hands back there.",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
Big box stores charge so much for these little brackets... and there’s zero difference in quality or functionality. This one is perfect when all you need is a slight tilt - we hung this in a bedroom. Done and done!,5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
The easiest to assemble tv wall mount in the world.  Put together and hung in less than 20 minutes.  The price was too good to be true and I wish I had found it prior to the over priced wall mounts.,5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,1
"So I waited a while to do a review but to be honest I've never hung a tv. I built up some confidence and with some help managed to get it in the wall and my tv in the air. It seemed so simple and so overwhelming. I advise you read and reread everything. The instructions aren't step by step it's more of here's this diagram and figure it out. You'll have tons of left over screws, washers and spacers. The seller got the product to me fast but the process of putting this thing up is time consuming. I wish anyone that buys this the best of luck and loads of patience.",5,1,2018-5-6,1,0,0
Works well and easy to install.  Would give it 5 stars but couldn't center it because of stud placement and the width of th bracket. We had it centered between 2 windows and there was a stud centered behind it. Didn't reach the length of the 16 inch studs for us to attach it on either side. Had to cut out dry wall and replace it with 3/4 inch plywood.  Couldn't find a mount that would extend this distance.  Seems to be a common problem for others as we researched.  Need to know the distance of your studs and where you are placing it.Be prepared for a project! We did make it work and it looks great. It is holding our giant heavy plasma well so far.,3,1,2016-12-27,1,1,0
"Best mount I have ever used! High quality , great assembly instructions with each screw, bolt , nut, metal arms numbered according to assembly instructions and individually in plastic pouches with extra sizes if yours is a little out if normal. Don’t but anywhere else when looking for wall mounts! No plastic parts all heavy gauge metal!",5,1,2019-1-26,1,0,0
I have a 65 inch tv hanging on my wall with this mount and it is very sturdy.  Not the most versatile in terms of angles etc but if you just need a low profile mount it is hard to beat this and the price is great.  Would recommend,5,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"My neighbor installed it for me because i had no idea how.  He did use stronger and bigger nails and screws, with that it set up perfectly for my 50 inch LG TV. This is definitely at least a 2 people job and make sure you know what you’re doing so you don’t drop your TV.",5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"This is one of the most underpriced mounts ever made. I used it for a 55"" 45-pound TV and it holds like a dream (no pun intended). It comes with enough screws, washers and spacers to ensure that it's almost impossible for a TV NOT to fit and the added HDMI cable and level are a huge bonus. I can't recommend this mount enough. Skip the $100 mounts at BestBuy that are half this one's quality and trust me on this.",5,1,2017-8-11,1,1,0
"Didn't work for my TV, and they didn't supply the correct screws or spacers that I would need.  They did include a lot of parts, but for my TV, it just wouldn't work.  Seemed to be heavy duty though.",3,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"It was easy to install, and works well on our fireplace.However, I wish I got one that tilted side by side and not just up and down. I can only adjust the vertical angle, and cannot turn it to see it from the next room.",4,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"Excellent quality wall mount. Was very easy to set up, especially with a level included. Instructions are clear and easy to understand. Mounted our 40"" LG on our wall. We have non standard 19"" wall studs so this was a perfect kit. Very heavy duty. Loved that it comes with a braided HDMI cable and a flush adapter, other kits don't include them and so that would of been an additional cost. Excellent value priced mount compared to others, would highly recommend.",5,1,2017-9-4,1,0,0
Good sturdy flat tv mount.  Mounted a 42 inch tv up against the wall.  Only thing I wasn’t thrilled about were the two straps that hang down from the mount to release the TV.  It almost invites little hands to pull on and release the tv from the mount. It still won’t fall as it needs to be lifted up but still wish for a better design.,4,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
Directions were clear.  Probably took me 20 minutes at most to install.  Didn’t run into any problems at all.  Installed on 2 - 50” Vizio flat screens.,5,1,2019-12-18,1,1,0
"Good range of motion and easy install. Bottom clips can pop off with very little force. Not a good solution for heavier tv, especially if you have little ones in the house that the TV could fall onto.",1,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
Definitely liked the price of this TV mount.  Installation was a breeze! The wall bracket was perfect for the studs in my wall. Even better that I was able to slide the TV with this mount to center it on the wall. (the studs in my wall did not allow the wall mount to be perfectly centered.) Worked perfectly with a 2017 Samsung 40in 6 series.,5,1,2019-4-23,1,0,0
"I’m not a total stranger to DIYs but this was simple to install and seems very sturdy. I gave it a good tug to ensure its integrity before mounting my 35 lb, 50 inch tv. You will need a drill bit and socket wrench which are not included, and a second person to lift the tv in place.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"Check the specs, you may need to buy drill bit pieces for this installation, but once you have everything it was pretty easy to install.  My TV is mounted pretty high over the chimney so I like that it angles down.  Also came with little velcro cable to organize your TV cords, a level, and I think even an HDMI cord if I remember correctly!  Super nice for the price :)",5,1,2018-10-11,1,0,0
I am using this as a wall mount for a 4 inch LED television. It is relatively easy To install and allows a kilt down word which was exactly why I purchased it. It is very sturdy and acceptable. Reasonably priced,5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"This worked for our application of hanging our 55"" tv.  We didn't want it to protrude from the wall too much and we didn't require it to swivel.  We just needed it to slightly tilt down.  Good price for a sturdy tv wall mount.",5,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"I mounted a 49"" LG hdtv and it worked great. It is easy to place on the wall mount  and easy to remove if you need to. Though you need to remove it from the wall mount if you want to change the angle of degrees of tilt. Well made, easy to Mount, great directions, great buy",5,1,2019-5-21,1,0,0
"Very nice and easy to install a mounting bracket. I like that they have extra pieces to match any TV, mine is 55"" Samsung. Took me almost 15 min, just you have to find the studs in your wall. Also, the distance between the wall and the TV is minimal. looks great.",5,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
ONE great feature that sets this one apart from others is the screws to level it AFTER It HAS BEEN INSTALLED.  that is a great feature  I have not seen on any others.  This is the second one I've ordered.,5,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"This is second one I have purchased.  Very good quality and very strong.  Large back bracket makes it very versatile and easy to find studs. Used on a heavy 35"" Visio (older LCD model) and a 2016 55"" Samsung UHD LED Smart TV (model UN55KU6290FXZA). Allowed Visio to be tilted down perfectly in bedroom and allowed flat (close) install of Samsung on playroom wall.",5,1,2017-6-6,1,1,0
Works great. Looks like it is attached directly to the wall. I like the release straps too as many of the close-to-wall fixed mounts are near impossible to unlatch. It worked great for my 70 inch with 400x400 VESA TV. I've found Mounting Dream and Mount-It to have quality product lines at decent prices.,5,1,2017-12-30,1,1,0
"Worked well but it really is the limit of this mount. I have a 55"" and lucky for me the studs in the wall were just perfect because with the 55"" there is no left -right adjustment. If the studs were off at all I would have had to send it back.",3,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
"This is a great mount. Super easy to assemble, clear instructions, and mounts very solidly to any studwall with the included hardware. They even included a level in the package to make sure you get it right. The tilt functionality works well too. If you need a good basic TV mount, this is it.",5,1,2019-4-7,1,0,0
"Fantastic TV mount. I've used others in the past, and this one is leagues better... and comes with everything! Even an HDMI cable. Once the wall plate is mounted you literally click on the TV in seconds and adjust from there. Adjustability virtically as well as horizontally is really good.Grab a recessed wall power outlet box and you've got an extremely inexpensive combo that's better then mounts I've used that were twice the price.",5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,1
It's a breeze to install if one has a stud finder.  Included are many different machine screws and spacers for a variety of TVs.  Make sure you extend the lower locking straps to their full length before hanging the TV if you're going to install at the full angle.,4,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0

"TV mount was great for what I need it. My only issue is either the bracket to small or my wall didn't have enough 2x4 so I had to find another spot, so I'll leave it on that but since I was able to find another good spot. One thing that I really like was the pull string lock pins instead of having to screw or unscrew them like other tv wall mounts in case you need to bring down the tv for any reason. So in all I'll give this a 5 of 5 stars and would highly recommend.",5,1,2016-7-13,1,1,0

Two thumbs up!,5,1,2019-1-28,1,0,0
"What started out terrible was VERY QUICKLY resolved by Mounting Dream’s email customer service team.

"The tv is mounted and hasn’t fallen yet so that is pretty good in my book. Haven't figured out how it tilts yet, but Hat hasn’t impacted my life as drastically as one might guess. I would 100% suggest/remind any buyers to pull in their power cord to their tv prior to mounting it. Very difficult to plug it in probs because I can’t figure out how to tilt the dang thing. I broke out in a little sweat but felt v accomplished after I plugged it in the back of the tv.",4,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0
The quality is there and it was super easy to install. It was nice to have the hdmi and cable ties.  I’m the least handy person I know and I was able to mount the tv so If I can do it anyone can.,5,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
"Great mount simple and effective. Fits very tight to wall for a clean look. Hardly see and cables or brackets once mounted. Had all the proper hardware in the box ready to go. I mounted to studs only, if I were to hange from drywall (do not recommend) I would purchase different drywall anchors. The slotted holes didn't line up with my studs so I just drilled new holes in bracket, easy adjustment for me since I had the proper tools. Great mount at a great price!",5,1,2016-5-25,1,1,0
Not as much functionality in this mount as in Mounting Dreams full range of motion iteration. I have both and highly value the ability to rotate the screen one way or another. This mount is stationary and only rotates a small degree in the vertical plane to minimize glare.,4,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0

"I never understand why people pay bestbuy or other electronic companies $400+ dollars to mount their tv (unless they want to hide there cables) when it can be done on your own for less than $50 if you have a few tools; a power drill, socket wrench and drill bits. No mount is more superior then another, its just a piece of metal with holes in it, that mount against studs in the wall, that attaches to the back of your tv.... thats it!!

It's a cheap TV stand but it does the job very easily. All the bolts and screws are well labeled and the included level was a must when trying to get it just right. Most flat screen TV sets are light and this will do the job for much less than what you'll find in A/V stores.,5,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0

Excellent stand. Easy to set up- comes with all hardware including a bubble level with good instructions.Update: the supplied level is useless. My 55” set is slightly tilted and the only way to fix is to remove the mounting screws and redo installation. Missing is a tilt adjustment. I have removed one star for this.

Great product. The flexibility to choose how far from the wall the tv can be mounted is a great feature.

Easy to install. Used drywall toggle bolts because stud spacing on non-load bearing wall is not aligned with the mounting bracket. Not a big deal though and it's still very sturdy. One person install.,5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0

"This came with all the needed hardware, but took a bit of assembly that was frustrating. It is made of light metal, likely a low grade steel, but our 65"" TV has been hanging for a couple of months with no problems. Certainly a cheaper option than what is available in stores.",4,1,2016-12-16,1,3,0
"This does not move from side to side, which is fine. We weren't looking for that. We just wanted the tv up and out of the way. And this does that perfectly. It is very secure. And was very easy to install.",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"I didnt want to spend an insane amount on a mount at a regular cause if you know, you know for bigger tvs they run pretty expensive. This was Easy to install. Came with everything you need minus the tools of course, just used a drill but came with a leveler and a hdmi cable which was cool. Holds our 58” just fine in our apartment.",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,1

"A perfectly adequate mount. Allows you to hit 2 studs that are 16"" spaced.NOTE: Before buying this, check the connection jacks on the back of the TV/monitor you are hanging - this mount will leave very little space between wall and TV. Make sure there is enough clearance for power cables, HDMI cables, etc to be plugged in.",4,1,2017-7-17,1,1,0
"Works excellent for our 40"" RCA flat screen!  I didn't want any tilt, and wasn't sure if this was capable of that, but it is!!  No concerns for it sliding off the rails as some mounts seem to, as it has built in stops on both sides.  The only possible issue is that it does still slide side to side, so if it is within children's reach, or anyone's really, it could be bumped, and move...we fixed this by cutting pencils to size, and put those along the track behind the tv.  Lovely mount!!",5,1,2015-1-3,1,3,0

"Super easy to install. Strongly recommend. The vertical brackets were mislabeled but I realized this before mounting it. The holes to tighten the angle are nearly impossible to reach if you have a 50” tv. Other than that, I’m very happy with this mount.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
Was able to install this pretty quickly. Love how all the parts are separated and labeled. Made the install a breeze. Did not use the included level though. It seemed to be a liitle off. Seems to be very sturdy with my 65” TV mounted on it. Also was easy to take the TV off so that I could install a sound bar mount a week after initially mounting it. Very solid product for the money.,5,1,2019-4-2,1,0,0
"First off, I would absolutely buy this again. The frame is sturdy, mounts are great. It fit our 32"" really well, and the quick latch system is super easy to use. I'm only giving it three stars because of the cheap lug screws and the misinformed directions.The instructions say to use a 5/32 to pilot the mounting holes. Not a chance. Far too small, especially considering that the screws are so cheap. Because they are cheap, when using a socket wrench to install, it stripped them within 3 turns.",3,1,2016-2-16,1,3,0

"Given the price, I was a tad skeptical of this at first, but the reviews convinced me. I’m glad I got this because it’s every bit as good as expected! It holds my old plasma TV (which is quite heavy) in my bedroom. For what I need it to do, it was worth every penny.",5,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0

"Very nice, mounted the TV, but it took 2 hours... really? Maybe I was having an off day, cause I’m good at house projects, but man... It was mostly my fault for not realizing the studs were off center, so I had to attach some 2x4’s to the studs to mount this to the wall securely, but still. Lots of tweaking... not intuitive at all.

"The main thing that attracted me to this TV mount was the easy attach and remove methods to the wall mount, however, i had the most difficult time attaching this mount to my wall. First, i was not aware that i would have to buy a drill but attachment for my power-driver, once i completed that and attempted to attach this mount to my wall, two of the screws for the mount stripped and i had to go out and buy a hex driver to remove them from the wall, and 4 new hex head screws to replace and the ones that came with this mount. I like the design of this mount and how easily hidden it is behind my tv, but the screws and hardware that came with it are cheap and un-usable, and i ended up spending a total of abt $25 extra to even be able to hang this on my wall",2,1,2018-6-12,1,0,0
Was able to put it all together and hang the tv up in about a hour. The hardest part was finding where and what height I wanted the tv to be. But the way the mount is set up taking it off and putting it back on the wall is so convenient.,5,1,2019-9-14,1,0,0

I bought this mount for a 55in Vizio smart TV for my mom. Set up was pretty easy. The mount itself came in two pieces which you attach together.

It does a fine job but there is an issue I've ran across after installation. I have my tilt out as far as it can go and then when I went to latch the tv to the wall unit the latch will not latch. The pull down strap to the latch is just fine but the latch needs to be dropped down about another 1/4 of an inch before it will latch. I will probably modify the bottom of the frame so I can latch the tv to the frame. It won't latch even with the tv not attached to the mount.

"I purchased this for my 75” LG and I love it. The mount feels secure and sturdy. Would definitely recommend. Actually, I purchased this after I put up another brand’s full motion mount which I clearly wasn’t a fan of. This mount here, is great!",5,1,2019-6-12,1,0,0
"The mount worked perfect on my Sony 32"" TV. I was able to mount the TV in around 20 minutes. I was just wide enough that the bolts on both sides screwed in the wall studs. Good price, good quality and easy to use. I also like the quick release loops which make it easy to take the TV off the wall. My one criticism is they give you a small liquid level which is either filled with a thick oil or the ball is extremely light. Basically it was slow to respond and I didn't feel it was accurate. I recommend you use your own level.",5,1,2014-12-9,1,1,0
"Very easy to install. Comes with a paper template to align on wall first to mark where to drill holes. My studs are 16.75"" apart (non-standard spacing) and this fit perfectly. Installing brackets on TV was simple and mounting to wall was easy, just follow instructions and mount to studs or concrete, not dry-wall alone. This was for a 42"" tv.",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,1
"I love when a product works as advertised. This mounted to the wall very easily with the included hardware. I would suggest using an impact driver to help get the large hex screw in the stud.It holds my old 80 lbs, 47 inch plasma without difficulty. I have had no issues. It does rotate up and down but not sideways so you will need to remember this when you mount it.

I ordered two of these and they worked perfectly for both a 40 inch tv and a 65 inch tv. Some much less expensive than other mounts I have purchased and just as good or better quality. The mounts came with many spacers and screw six options including the ones I needed. I haven’t used the hdmi cable as I have those already. Not sure about the quality of those. The included level is too short to be useful. I used a four foot one to make sure it was level.,5,1,2018-4-19,1,0,0

"The mount does exactly what it claims to. It's very low profile and sturdy. Unfortunately because it's so low profile, there isn't enough room to organize cables or adjust the mount's tilt.

I mounted it in my kids playroom and the tilt angle is exactly what they needed to not strain their necks when watching from the futon across the room.  It was easy to mount with simple instructions.  My only complaint is the necessity to remove the TV from the wall to attach the cables to the back.  If your TV has ports on the side then it will not be an issue for you.  I would definitely buy this again if I need to mount another TV.  It comes with plenty of mounting hardware and every screw size imaginable to fit your TV or wall.

"This is a great quality product, with a great price.  The rails (attached to the back of the TV) clamp easily and securely onto the mounting bracket (screwed onto the wall).  Tip - do not tilt the unit until the lower clamps are in place, or it will be hard to connect.  The one caution is if you have a smaller TV.  The add says it is for 26 - 50 inch TVs.  I am using this with a Vizio 32 inch, and the rails of this unit are the same height as my TV, so I would think that the rails would extend beyond the top and bottom of smaller TVs.  The rails are 17 inches long.  Measure your TV height before buying.",5,1,2015-6-7,1,0,0
"Overall a nice utilitarian mount with simple install.  If you have 16"" centers then it is a great value.

Mount is very solid and not flimsily made of thin metal like some other lower priced mounts. The installation instructions were clear and the variety of hardware included for various applications was more than sufficient (including a magnetic pocket level). The unit is made very well and was a breeze to install. I installed my tv with the #8 spacers (biggest) with about a 6 degree tilt. If your television has no obstructions at the bottom to clear- go ahead and install it with a tilt from the beginning as I did.

It's well made but poorly sized. The width is really too narrow. It should be a little over 36 inches so it catches standard spaced wall studs. This is 24 inches so if the studs are offset from the center line of your room the TV is offset too. Poor design.,1,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0

"It's OK. The latches on the bottom will not engage (i.e. the TV is not secured) if you set the angle to tilt all the way. In order to get around this I had to loosen the tilt screws, attach the TV, tilt it to the angle I wanted, and then tighten the screws after. The problem with this is you need to reach quite far behind the TV to access the screws, and you cannot tighten the inner ones.

The most important part is to have the right tools.One comment I have is that in the directions, when putting the initial thicker bolts into the wall to put the frame up, it instructs you to use a much smaller drill bit than you need to use... I ended up using the size of the drill bit it asked for, and then going up a size at a time until I could get the bolt into the drywall and eventually into the stud behind (snugly).

"This company makes good if not great Tv mounts.  I have several.  I'm a designer so I'm more aware of possibilities for improvement than most.  With this mount the first thing that should be redesigned are the cloth loops used to release the lower rail latches.  They work OK, but then don't want to tuck away out of sight.  After they're tucked away it's hard to retrieve them for unlatching.  They should be replaced by folding plastic finger loops that would click in up and down positions.",4,1,2015-5-19,1,0,0
"Easy to install. Works exactly as advertised. Solid construction for it's purpose. I used it to mount a 40"" lcd television on the back porch. This mount's design makes it easy to remove the tv and bring it inside during the winter months. It came with almost all of the hardware I needed. I only needed two small washers to attach the tv to the mount because the mounting holes on the tv are not the same depth all around. The lag bolts that I used to mount the frame to the wall were easily installed and created a solid connection. I would highly recommend it, especially for the price.",5,1,2015-7-14,1,4,0

Great value! We mounted 3 tvs in our home all were relativity close as far as the panel and studs were concerned my only warning would be make sure that your two studs are close to each other because the panel is not that large .. you may also want to note how wide the screws are behind your Tv because that will determine how much you'll be able to slide the Tv on the Mount to center it where you would like to have it on the wall.

Personally works great for me. It was my first time ever putting up a TV and thankfully this was an easy install. Of course you’ll need other things like stud finder etc but over great the only thing I dislike about it is the amount of space it allows for the lift to be able to connect to a port. You would have to take it off the mount then again could just be the size of my tv.,4,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0

Went together well enough.  No matter what I do I can’t get the tv to level out.  So.  Buy something else.  This one kinda stinks.  Only reason I’m giving it 2 stars is because it’s cheap and keeps the kids tv out of reach of the kids.,2,1,2019-1-1,1,0,0

I wanted to add in an HDMI cable and I ended up having to dismount the TV because I couldn't reach the ports. The mount just doesn't have the flexibility to add cables it would seem.

This took about 20 minutes for me to install.  I only needed a little help with the TV.  The straps hang down beyond the TV but was easily remedied with some tape.  The TV hasn't fallen so thats a plus.  It was easy to get the TV off and on as we had to adjust the angle once.  We installed a 55in TV.,5,1,2018-2-13,1,0,0
"Rather poorly made, and the hole spacing did not fit a standard VESA pattern on my TV (although, in fairness, perhaps the TV spacing was off - but isn't that why we HAVE VESA spacing standards?).Also, HUGE lag bolts for use in wood studs. Logical for a 70"" plus monster, but way overkill for the bottom end of the range.",3,1,2015-9-16,1,0,0
"Simple to use.  Simple instructions.  Works as intended.Only negatives were that the TV brackets were hard to level together and the TV kept leaning left or right.  Had to keep taking them down and adjusting.  Also, the straps that hang out the bottom--do just that.  They hang out the bottom and past the TV, no fasteners or anything to hide them.  Nothing a couple zip ties couldn't fix though.",4,1,2015-12-16,1,0,0
I hadn't installed a wall mount TV prior to buying this kit.  I found it very easy to follow all the instructions to get the job done.  Very solid and no worry about holding the weight it says.

I was amazed by how easy it was for me and my husband to install our flat screen TV on the wall ourselves with this mount.

Mounts the TV fine. But there is no room for error when trying to mount your TV centered. If you don't mount it centered then your TV will be off center when mounted bc thee is no room to slide it along the base.

This thing was a GIANT pain in the rear last night. How are you supposed to loosen the tilt screws when you can't even get a hand in between the TV and the mount once it's on the wall? We took our new TV on and off the wall no less than 5 times trying to see if we were missing a step but we weren't. We finally loosened the tilt screws before we mounted the TV and that worked. The directions left much to be desired. Now that the TV is up it looks nice and hopefully we won't have to fool with taking it down for a LONG time.,4,1,2017-12-7,1,5,0

"This is  decent enough mount, compatible as listed for my application.My issue with it is that it does not tilt 15° as indicated.  If you attempt to do so, the locking mechanism does not clear the frame when you attempt to install the TV.  It is a simple design flaw.  The tilting mechanism changes the distance from the top mount catch to the locking jaw since it swings out on a pivot.  The length is shortened by about a quarter inch.  This causes the locking jaw to not clear the frame.",2,1,2017-7-24,1,2,0

Was hesitant to get this because of the low price. I used this on a 55' plasma TV. Turns out it worked out perfectly and the installation was easy peasy. The hardest part was drilling through the brick on my fireplace. Once I got this installed it was very stable and I have no concerns for coming off. The only hard part is tilting once the TV is on there. Definitely need 2 people for this. All in all I am delighted and so happy that will work perfectly,5,1,2016-10-14,1,0,0
"This is the easiest mount to install.  You always need some type of device that connects the flat panel TV to the bottom rail of mount to secure it.  Most mounts use security screws accomplish this, which are effective, but difficult and sometimes impossible to reach to tighten, resulting in a unsecured mounting.  Mounting Dream mounts use spring loaded clamps that are easily access by a small loop of fabric.  My wife and I practiced mounting the TV to the mount a few times before the mount was on the wall.  Then, we carefully lifted the TV, each one of us on a side and had it securely connected to both the top and bottom rails in seconds.Plenty of fasteners and shims included to accommodate a variety of televisions, including curved panels.",5,1,2015-9-21,1,3,0

IF you are hiding cords, get flush type plugs (less than 1.5"" from wall to tv) or buy something else.",4,1,2018-1-16,1,0,0

The product itself is fairly sturdy and fit my tv well. The only problem I encountered was when I had to place it onto the wall. When it came down to put the screws in the wall they completely failed. They wouldn't go into a stud and had difficulty going through drywall.  So after 5 failed holes in the wall I bought some wood screws and toggle bolts. Those worked perfectly and completed mounting the tv. So my suggestion buy some wood screws and toggle bolts and you'll be all set if you're mounting it onto wall like mine.,3,1,2015-12-3,1,0,0

"Mount arrived in excellent packaging and excellent shape. It's pretty straight forward and not too complex. I wanted this mount for a 40 inch LG flat screen in a small camping trailer. I needed the ability to remove the TV from the mount easily to transport it in the secure box that it came in while traveling long distances. The mount is solid and the arms just make it to the 400 mm distance of the LG TV mount points. The two spring activated release pins don't hold the TV perfectly solid as there is a small amount of play in that area at the bottom. However it doesn't seem to be a problem as the TV overall is held very secure otherwise. In fact, we have trailered the unit on our first trip without removing the TV and there were no issues at all. The TV releases easily by pulling down on the two straps at the bottom which was my main directive. The TV is free to slide side to side however which may not be good if your mounts are less than 400 mm apart. As such this side movement was eliminated on ours by simply bending the top hooksout about 3/16 of an inch which then rests them against the stay on the main frame so there is no movement. If this was mounted on a wall in a room, there would be no issue at all obviously. The fact that it also came with a 6 foot HDMI cable didn't hurt either as I connect my PS4 with it in the camper.",5,1,2015-10-15,1,2,1

"I purchased this mount for the TV in my office which is high on the wall. I was impressed on how well the parts were separated and labeled.

Amazing that I spent less than 20 bucks on the same type of product that sells at a discount club for 60 dollars.  Worked perfectly with my LG 55'' screen.  I used the spacers that were included to help protect the cords from the wall.  High quality product for a fraction of the cost.  The included balance and HDMI cord is a bonus.  The only flaw is the lack of turn dial or knob to easily tilt the screen instead this requires allen wrench...not that big of a deal.,5,1,2017-12-19,1,0,0

The good for the money! Study mount.Brought this for our 38'' flat screen and it is fantastic! Easy to install and gives a decent range of tilting angles. Plus it was an awesome price! Under $20. It is really good for the money. For less than $20 you'll not find anything else as study or as easy to set up as this is.

"Product is very sturdy supports my 55"" TV no problem. Mounting it is easy and fairly quick. The reason I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish there was a way I could easily adjust the tilt while it is on the wall.

"Bought 2 48"" TVs at a box store on Black Friday and, luckily, my son urged me NOT to buy my wall mounts, there (they wanted about $90 each for them), but rather to get something through Amazon.  The price of this one was so reasonable, that I had some misgivings about the quality.  No need for qualms, this unit (I bought 2) is completely adequate for my Samsung TVs.  Granted, these TVs are not heavy, but these mounts could have taken on a much heavier load just fine.  There are some clever strap loops, that remind me of subway handles that hang from the roof. These hang down, but are not visible in that they do not hang below the bottom of the TV.  However, they are ""release"" grips. When mounting, it's not uncommon to put the TV up on the mount and take it down a few times as you fool around with the hardware and, in my case, shelf brackets below for a DVD player.  But these mounts lock in place, and you have to have a way to release the lock to take it down. These straps make it easy to feel up under the TV and pull the two releases to take the TV down. Pros: quality parts, nicely finished (no sharp edges) all parts lined up just fine.  Even includes an HDMI cable! that easliy covers the cost of the mount by itself! (The cable is rather stiff - but who really cares much).  Great price.  I didn't try the tilt function, didn't need it.) Possible Cons: The TV can slide left or right on the mount so you can center it perfectly, but I didn't see a set screw that locks the mount once you find your sweet spot, so it can still slide if bumped.  I don't bump into my TVs much, though, so that's minor.",5,1,2016-12-8,1,9,0

"Well, this is a simple mechanism and seems to work fine, but it doesn't really fit well with the Samsung UN32J5003 32-Inch 1080p LED TV. Because of the irregular back, the spacers are necessary, but due to the depth of recess of the inserts on the TV, there is only a little less than a single turn of thread engagement! This doesn't inspire confidence, so I had to mill the spacers down to a size that lets the bolts get a better grip (with added lock washers, which are not included but are a good idea).Also, on that TV model, it is necessary to saw off an inch or so of the vertical members to they won't be visible above or below the TV. For both these reasons, I don't think this product is a good fit with that specific model of TV.

"The mount spans 16"" on center, so anything more than that requires a different mount.  I used it on a Vizio 32"" LED LCD TV, and the vertical brackets are almost too long.  The mount comes with a plethora of screws and spacers.  When it is clipped to the mount, it doesn't feel nearly as sturdy as other mounts I have used (Ikea, Sanus).  You also need to tilt the TV after it is mounted, otherwise it won't clip to the bottom of the mount for whatever reason.  There are black straps that are pulled down to unclip the TV mount from the wall mount, that's all well and good, but then they hang down unless you tuck them up under the TV.  Once the TV is mounted and secured, it moves around too much for my liking.For the money, this mount will work.  I would't trust it for a heavy TV, and there is no way a TV smaller than 32"" will work, because you will see the vertical brackets.  I did not test the HDMI cable that came with it, but it looks like a quality cable.",3,1,2016-9-7,1,1,0

You have to hook the left one and then slide it all of the way to the left.  Then you can hook the right one.

For the cost this mount holds up like the rest. the only this that I was disappointed at was the title action it really doesn't give you enough tilt. The TV that I mounted this looks flat on the wall even in full tilt.,4,1,2015-6-28,1,0,0

"Quick shipping,  arrived sooner than expected.  Not crazy  about the tilt option  only because, you literally have to decide a final angle.

You gotta tighten the bolt to keep  it in the position. I found  a good angle and left it be. Still happy  with the product, and for the price it was worth it.",4,1,2015-6-11,1,0,0

Also comes with a ton of different sized bolts, spacers in case you have a TV with a weird shaped back, HDMI cable and a little magnetic bubble level which I saved for using on any future wall mounting brackets since its really convenient.To all the other reviews on here with people complaining about lack of adjustability or its too small, the product dimensions are listed.  You can take this thing called a tape measure and see if you have the right stud spacing before ordering.  Also it says right in the description that if you need more adjustability use a different mount and even gives a part number.

"I was able to get my tv mounted using this mount, but some of the instructions make it very difficult. I'm very handy, so I'd like to think that this isn't attributed to assembler error.You have to drill pilot holes in the studs and then screw the mount into those pilot holes. The bit that the manual suggests for the pilot holes is way too small for the lag bolts that come to mount it. I ended up drilling over and over and over in my wall to try to make the pilot holes big enough for the lag bolts. Even after I got my pilot holes the right size, the lag bolt's threads were so far apart that it just didn't quite grip my stud and self-drive like they needed to. I ended up having to use my own bolts that had thread that was closer together.",2,1,2016-8-25,1,0,0

"Most wall mounts are fairly simple products. For this mount, you definitely get what you pay for, or even less. The wall bracket is pretty flimsy, even when tightening the bolts to the wall studs by hand, it can alter the bracket's shape slightly.

The bottom latches used to lock the TV on to the wall brackets are MADE OF CHEAP PLASTIC! Broke the first time attempting to mount the TV. I had to use super glue as a ghetto fix.

"Be careful, your expensive flat panel TV can slide edge to edge on the rail without any restrictions.  It will NOT fall off the mount, there are stoppers on the end of the rails, BUT it will slide along the entire length of the rail...  when I emailed mounting dream about this they said that I installed the mount correctly and if i'm concerned about my expensive OLED TV moving side to side along the mount that should hold the TV securely, I should go to my local hardware store and purchase a slide window stopper security device. - REALLY !I should return the item, but its already bolted/screwed into my wall with my TV handing on it...  I'm not going to change it, but I should...  they cut corners, probably to keep the price down...",2,1,2017-11-28,1,1,1

"We purchased a new 50"" TV for the bedroom and decided to wall mount it rather than sit it on the dresser like the old unit. We did not need the mount to swivel so we wanted one that was economical and easy to install. After reading the reviews in Amazon, we settled on this one. It was easy to install because it had a one piece mounting plate (which made it simple to ensure levelness and centering with the studs. The big decision was where and how high to install the mount. We tried different heights with pieces of masking tape on the wall to represent the corners of the TV. Once you commit to its placement, the installation took only about 15 minutes. We are very happy how it turned out and the sturdiness of the mount. And it only cost about $16 and came with an HDMI cable.",5,1,2015-12-27,1,1,0

This  is  my third wall mount from mounting dream.  I just love their product and plug usually the cheapest I have tried dutronics Samsung and several other brands.  But my favorite feature in all of their mounts similar to cheetah mounts by the way. Is the spring loaded locks. Install always requires a do it yourself and make sure to always check for live wires when drilling or nailing into housing walls. It is a good quality mount and they have been consistent in their manufacturing process. Not as high quality material as other mounts but I have never had any issues or defects another feature is the Allen key screws for tilt adjustment that way no one else can adjust the tv but me. It is about 3 inches from the wall to the back of the tv. I always love the included bubble labeler and the hdmi cable is okay I never use it though.

"Good wall mount that is easy to install and comes with all the hardware necessary. The hardest part of installing the mount was finding the studs in the wall. Once that was done, the product was up in no time.Even though it's a great mount, there are a couple of issues to be aware of. The first is that the mounting holes are exactly 16 inches apart, since most studs are about 16 inches apart from each other. This isn't an issue if your studs spaced perfectly, but if for some reason you need even a half inch more, you're stuck with putting this in the drywall. The other reason is that if you have a larger tv, it can be hard hang the hooks in the right place. The first time we put our 40"" tv in, we thought we were good until we double checked the back and one of the hooks was hanging off to the side. There isn't much room left, and if left unchecked this would have left the tv hanging on a small hook.",5,1,2016-4-14,1,0,0

"The product has serious design flaw.  Whoever designed it did not put any thoughts about adaptability on different studs distance, resulting the product being quite picky on the studs distance.  If my studs were spaced even half inch farther, I would have to just return this.It was thanksgiving and my family were so excited to have the new TV so I installed it by all means.  The spacing of my studs is so on the edge that the mount just would not work according to studs finder.  I had to pin probe the drywall the old way mm by mm.  In the end there is less than 5mm left on stud to each pilot hole.  Was worried like hell about damaging my stud the whole process.  Still not completely in relief.",2,1,2016-11-25,1,0,0

"Super fast installation! No instructions required (included). I purchased this for a single mother friend of mine that needed a mount for her new TV installed right before her party New Years Day. She had me order it Tuesday! Amazon delivered as promised on Thursday and I had it up before guests arrived Friday in less than 20 minutes. That's un-packaging, determining where to place the bracket, drilling the 3 anchor holes, hammering the included wall anchors in, mounting the bracket with the included sturdy Phillips head anchor bolts, installing the 2 quick release arms that attach to the back of the tv and then setting the tv onto the wall bracket. Super easy and smooth as butter. I will be ordering another for my kids room soon. I usually order from Monoprice but this low profile mount impressed me in quality, craftsmanship, and ease of installation (everything was included hardware wise + hdmi cable + mini level).

They also included a wide array of screws, washers, and spaces in an attempt to accomodate virtually any installation.  The instructions left something to be desired but the design is so simple I don't think you really need them.  The hardest part was finding the correct placement on the wall and then making sure that the lag screws would hit a stud.  If you are moderately handy this should not be difficult for you.  I was able to mount our Vizio M55 by myself in under an hour.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this and will buy one again if needed for other TVs in the future.",5,1,2016-2-19,1,0,0

"As others have noted, there is VERY little play on this mount. If you want to be sure you can align the TV accurately in the middle of a wall, be prepared to mount a plywood panel behind the actual TV mount - it's very unlikely that you'll get it to align otherwise. However, mine was just two inches off center once I had it up, and in terms of use it's fine. Like most cheap mounts, it doesn't give you much room behind the TV - if you have a lot of connectors, and if any come out at right-angles to the TV, instead of being edge-connectors, you'll almost certainly need to invest in some right-angled adaptors for your cables. The 'lock' mechanism is a cute design, but leaves the release straps hanging below the TV. I solved that just by tying the ends together. YMMV.",3,1,2016-8-21,1,0,0

"Bought this based on all the good reviews. Buyer's should be aware if you have standard 16"" studs that aren't centered over where you want the TV to be, there is no adjusting. I bought this and the center of where I wanted to mount it is offset to the left of the two studs, so it would not work.The reason I rated this so highly even though it didn't work was the level of customer service I received. Mounting Dream worked very closely and diligently to make sure I was able to get what I needed and worked with me until I was completely satisfied. Highly recommend this company, as they make other products that should fit your needs if you need to offset from the studs.",5,1,2016-11-13,1,1,0

"Mounted a  Flat Samsung 55"" in a master bedroom. For the low price you pay for this wall mount unit you will not do better. Quality is good, I didn't look at the instructions because real men don't need instructions, real men never get lost and real men think an inch is bigger then it is. That being said, the wall unit mounted without problems and it does tilt down, included is a level and HDMI cord if needed. The TV locks into place and with a pull of two cords unlocks to be removed.  Get another person to help you lift the TV into the mount. About a half hour DIY job once you fine the wall studs.",5,1,2017-1-19,1,1,0
