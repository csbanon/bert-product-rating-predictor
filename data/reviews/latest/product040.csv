"I got this in a rush when I needed a new headset. In hindsight a bit more research would have had me getting something else. As a precursor to the review I feel that it is worth noting that I am very rough on audio peripherals. I don't know why, but they usually last me about 6 months regardless of the quality and price. This is why I choose to buy at a cheaper price point more frequently rather than high-end less frequently.Pros:",5,1,2018-6-27,1,1,0
"This headset is light weight and has very good quality sound for the price and is very comfortable. Microphone works good as well. Lights on the sides of the headset make it look nice.Only complaint is that this headset is meant for PC users given the fact that both the USB cable and microphone plug in are connected very close together to the cable. Meaning, that if you are playing on PS4 you plug the microphone cable into the controller but can't plug the USB cable into the system for the lights. I ended up buying a 3 foot USB extension cable in order to be able to use the lights. So if you are using anything other than a PC and want the lights on the headset while you play, then you'll need an USB extension cable.",5,1,2017-9-17,1,6,0
Great quality headset and sound. Lights are not too bright whatsoever.Pros:,5,1,2018-4-9,1,4,0
These are everything!!!  We had bought some like these earlier this year.  And they cost more.  They are already broke and the sound qualify was nothing compared to these babies.  All my kids love to play on the ps4 with friends as well as the laptop.  These headphones work perfectly for both.  They even wear them with games that dont allow chatting.  Wish I had waited to give them as a christmas present!,5,1,2019-12-17,1,4,1
Works great for the given price. Good bang for your buck,5,1,2018-3-23,1,4,1
"I'll start off by saying I'm a middle aged dad who purchased this for my teenage son so that he would stop borrowing his sister's Beats for gaming.  I was first expecting to pay $100, but was pleasantly surprised by the pricing and reviews for these.I just now tested these, and to me, they don't seem too bad.  The audio quality is lesser than the Beats he was using, but to me, that's OK.  They are not as comfortable as the Beats either, but they're still fine for wearing for hours on end.",4,1,2017-11-17,1,1,0
"First of all, very aesthetically pleasing. The LED lighting is awesome. Stays plugged in at my desk and even walking by at night just look awesome. These over ear headphones sit very comfortably and don’t make my ears as tired as a lot of other headphones do. Not too heavy, feel right. Zero issues with sound quality. These also sit really well on my smaller kids’ heads, unlike most big headphones/headsets. Have the option to easily extend the headband. The over ear design offer great sound isolation, even with no active noise cancelling. The USB plug must be plugged into a power source to make the LED lights work of course, that is the USB plugs only purpose on this headset. All speaker and mic signal is only thru the analog connection on the non-detachable Y-cable end. Only thing to improve the product would be if the same USB port can also be used to deliver sound instead of only thru the 3.5mm plug. Great value headphones, seem very durable.",5,1,2019-12-21,1,3,1
"I have been through at least 5 gaming headphones(other brands)  for my teenager. These are really great quality. Sound, wire, and sound canceling features make this product a great buy.",5,1,2018-4-20,1,3,0
oh my lord these guys  at BENGOO are AMAZING. they  sent me an email about  having a review and email them back about any  issues all i wrote was i loved the headset worked right out of  the box packaging was great only down side is theirs no  cable splitter which  wasn't a big deal i just buy a splitter but no they emailed me back with a thankful  message for an apology and will refund me 30% of the  total cost now wow. that is a GREAT customer service and as for that this product receives a 5 star would recommend to ANYONE looking for a nice headset.,5,1,2017-7-19,1,1,0
"I'm a gamer, I bought few pairs of headphone for both PS4 and PC gaming. I was very surprised by what this headphone can offer! For this price point I don't think you can get anything better than this. It's good quality, comfortable, easy to use, very good sounds and noise cancellation! I mean, come on guys! $20 it's a amazing deal! I had some headphone ove $100 may or maybe stand up with this one!",5,1,2017-5-26,1,4,0

"Spend just a few dollars more and buy a headset from a company that actually care about their products. Bengoo does not run a tight ship. The mic is rigid, poorly angled, and can only be rotated in place. In fact, the whole headset is bizarrely inflexible. It just doesn't bend to fit your head at all. The sound quality is appalling. The mic barely works at all. The LEDs are pointlessly bright and I had to unplug them due to screen glare. The manual is practically illegible: ""There are electrics of strong magnetic field at hand, please take away them (such as the mobile phone, fan ...);"". Whoever tested my headset didn't care enough to know their left from their right, because the headphones were flipped. I could either have all my sound reversed or have my mic behind my head. The manual says that it comes with an adapter, but the adapter wasn't in the box and the Amazon description says the adapter isn't included, so I think the manual inside the box belongs to a different product? The corners that have been cut are hilariously terrible. If you don't have a free option of refunding items through Amazon, steer very clear.",1,1,2017-7-28,1,1,0
"Don’t waste your time on this headset. The only reason it’s so highly rated is because the company offers to give you a bunch of free stuff if you give them a 5 star rating.The truth is that despite having a prime membership, this order didn’t arrive for 3 weeks. The box was severely damaged and when I went to test the headset, the audio cable didn’t even work.",1,1,2020-5-22,1,9,0
"The G9000 Pro Gaming headset is the best headset I’ve ever had.  The foam padding is super comfortable and the length is easily adjustable.  It comes with both a usb plug and a plug for a headphone jack, so it’s compatible with both my PS4 and laptop.  It also has an adjustable volume and a switch to mute your own microphone, and it looks great, so that’s a plus.",5,1,2019-2-2,1,1,1
"I work from home and talk to customers on the pc all day, a week after I got these customers were complaining they couldnt hear me and to speak up. 2nd and 3rd week it got worse, I had to shout for people to hear me and even then they said they could barely hear me. The headphones have good sound but the mic is junk. Waste of money. I ended up getting 2 pairs of platronics headsets that are a lot more expensive but way more reliable.",1,1,2020-2-14,1,9,0
"*update* the company has emailed me 2x since my original review offering me a new product and refunding my money in exchange for a “4 or 5 star review”. Beware all the good reviews on here, they could be skewed from compensation.My teenager used these for his computer games. He said the headphones were ok, but they didn’t cancel out noise very well, and he wished they were a bit louder. His friends online told him they couldn’t hear him well at all while he used these, like he was whispering. He actually opted to use his old broken headset (that he actually taped back together) rather than continue to use these. I’m trying to figure out if we can return them after they’ve been used or not.",2,1,2020-1-10,1,7,0
"Received to be a defective headset in the beginning but it has come to my attention that the thing defective was actually my sound card on my PC. It was intermittent. Since the headphones I received sounded muffled, I could still hear everything around me and can hear the game but very faint even with full volume up. But just yesterday, I tried them out on the new sound card and I could hear the game with amazing sound and the background noise could barely be heard. I actually take my entire review back because these are awesome headphones. The price point for these are great. The company did reach out to me a couple days ago in regards to my headphone problems and since they couldn't send me a new pair, they refunded me the full purchase price. I admire the great customer service. I will definitely be using that money they refunded me to purchase a second headset for my Xbox One. Thank you Bengoo!",5,1,2018-1-9,1,1,0
"Mine is a daily use thing it sounds really good, has actual directional surround, good bass, it has lights on it which is hilarious I love mine for gaming.  If you get a patch cable for the microphone side like I did it'll reach around to big surround sound audio systems.",5,1,2020-1-14,1,9,0
"I purchased these headphones when they were listed for $21.99. I would not pay the 40 dollars they are listed for now. They are not comfortable when wearing for a period longer than an hour. The sound quality is subpar. The mic leaves a lot to be desired in the aspect of clarity and quality of voice. After a year or so of wear, the LEDs have begun to flicker. Although this does not impede performance it is a question of quality.My biggest issue with these headphones is that they do not fair well if being worn over multiple hours of gaming. They fatigue my ears. These headphones make my ears feel crushed, not cushioned like my bose headsets do. Yes were talking hundreds of dollars of price difference but if they put a softer foam it would be the same.",3,1,2020-4-11,1,3,0
"Do not get these, they are small, the earpeices are non adjustable, so if youve got a smaller head theyre worse, they do not have memory foam, the padding is hard foam, they are uncomfortable to wear for extended periods and have passable at best sound quality. The padding on top is uncomfortable and they squeeze very hard under the ear. I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! These shouldnt cost the almost fifty dollars they are, they should cost around ten or less based upon the quality. The metal in the struts is thin alluminum and bends all too easy. I wouldnt even buy these again if they paid me. Absolute garbage, do not waste your money. Get razer kraken x, its the same price but its actually comfy, light, sturdy, has an amazing mic and actual memory foam. Also the mic is adjustable so you can have it straight out and also curved towards your mouth so you can speak quieter. They also have better overall sound and have 40 mm neodinium drivers",1,1,2020-5-20,1,4,0
"I got these because they had a good overall review and were cheap, however they perform much worse than other headsets I've tried at a similar price point. Comfort wise, they're about right for the price, but the quality of sound coming in through the headset is very poor and that's the main reason to buy them so I have to give them a two-star review. They do work, and the microphone is okay so not one star but... I do not recommend",2,1,2020-2-15,1,5,0
"When I bought the Kotion Each, Pro Gaming Headset, I had never heard of them before. I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality, I can hear every movement, and even every raindrop with this headset. My ears are totally encased in padded softness, and the top of the headset even has padding, so the headset doesn’t hurt my head with long term wear. My voice is heard over the mic clearly and I appreciate the picture of on and off at each end of the volume control, so there is no confusion as to whether people can hear my private conversations or not. I’m impressed that it came with a built in USB for the blue lights and an additional connector/splitter for sound and mic, I thought I was going to have to purchase one separately. I love the super long cord, which allows me to move around my system freely, without pulling the microphone splitter out by accident. The cord also has a Velcro wrap on it that allows me to wrap and keep the extra cord length out of my way. When the led blue lights are on I look like I am battling in some space movie, it looks supercool. I’m using it for online school and gaming, and my only problem is now the rest of my family all want one!",5,1,2020-1-25,1,3,0
"I got this headset for my son for Christmas. His exact words were 'Dad, you won Christmas.' He continued by telling me it made him better at a couple of his first person shooter games because he is now able to hear certain noises from certain directions which gave him the ability to shoot first.  He mentioned other such advantages the headphones but it all started to sound like jibberish- gamer speak. Anyway, nice product!! I and my son will be recommending to others.",5,1,2017-12-28,1,1,0
"I had ordered this for my grandson's 11th birthday. The description said it worked with the Nintendo Switch, which he has. He was so excited to open it on his birthday, 9/09/19. Imagine his disappointment when he tried to use it to play with another player. He couldn't hear anything the other person said. We tried to adjust volume, etc. but no luck. The instructions were not helpful at all. The return window had already closed so he's stuck with earphones that don't work as described!UPDATE:",3,1,2019-10-8,1,5,0
"i don't use these for gaming. I use them for listening to news and other stuff while I am art work, and for conference calls, webinars, and other online meetings. These seem to be quite well-built. The controls are on the cord, but, they are also sturdy, and the cord is not that super-thin filament that feels like it will get broke all the time - instead, they have a sturdy, thick cord that feel robust. The controls have a nice feel, and there's an analog switch to turn off the mic entirely. That's really nice when I am on a conference call meeting and I want to be certain i am not going to be heard talking smack about one of the other people in the meeting(!). Cord is also quite long, so I don't get jerked around when I scoot over to a different part of my desk.I think they would be good for gaming, the mic is good, sound is good, earmuffs are relatively comfortable.",4,1,2020-1-23,1,3,0
"Excellent, my 9 yr old loves it, to be able to speak and listen there is a switch on the side, this is for the other reviewers that said can’t speak and listen at the same time. My son it is also cool that He can hear the game sounds through the head set. Cable is really long so no issues there either. we’ve had it a couple of weeks. He doesn’t play every day thought but it is working perfectly.",5,1,2018-3-11,1,2,0
"I play on xbox one, and before this purchase I was using the turtle wireless gaming headphones. After about 2 years of heavy use, they broke. I was not able to spend over $100 on a new set, but needed something I found these. I paid about $25. I got what I paid for. The headset is very nice looking., and feels like it is made very well. Since I plug mine into my controller I do not use the cool led lights fearure. I did plug them into a usb to see how they look, and it does look very cool. But for console gaming, you can't use it. If you bought these for PC gaming, then yes you could use it, and they are neat. I have an average to large size adult head, and the headphones fit my head no problem, as they are adjustable. I think maybe I have large ears because they just barely fit into the earmuff part of the headphones. No problem really, but after 20 - 30 minutes of use, it irritates/hurt a little. So I have learned to take off my head inbetween games.... no biggie ( $25 ).  Everything works as described. The sound seems a little low for what I would like for gaming headphones, but they sound ok. I am thinking maybe not enough power from my controller to make it louder, they may get louder if plugged into a PC, I have not tested that. The cord is made of some strong nylon type of material, it is excellent. I am happy with my purchase, they are inexpensive headphones, for when you need something and can't justify paying for higher quality. They are doing everything I need.The breakdown on how I determine my star rating of a product…",4,1,2020-3-15,1,5,0
"This headset is perfect and beautiful in many ways! It completely cuts sound out from the outside and allows you to hear the whole game and conversations of your friends. You can adjust the volume of both settings, mine was on XBOX, and make the whole experience awesome. The LED lights are so bright and beautiful plus my favorite color! I definitely recommend this headset. The only thing I have a complaint about is the headset will squeeze on your ears and hurt if you wear glasses. Other than that, it is perfect!",5,1,2019-3-30,1,8,1
"These worked great the first few months, but have since given me a bit of a hassle. They at times might not connect properly, with one side only working until chord is moved a certain way then works again. I'd say if it was a little bit less in cost it would be worth for how they work and the length they last, but I'm not very happy with this  and will probably be investing elsewhere after they completely give out. I have to also state, I've purchased two other ones from this same company (around same time) and both of those have stopped working right.",2,1,2019-11-17,1,7,0
"Product failed all my expectations. I thought  I was purchasing a wireless headset with microphone I could use for PS4.  When i recieved this product there were no English instructions. This product does have a cord. I thought well, i have it here lets test it out. 1.) I could not find an adaptor for the PS4. 2) I finally found a way to piggyback an adaptor, but there was no sound. 3) I tried an adaptor into my phone , turned on sound from other devices, made sure volume was on and turned up.... no sound. 4) I turned each switch each way and turned the dial, still no sound, 5) i hooked the USB directly to the TV, a light came on, ahhh there is hope after all, still no sound. 6) an evening of my life ruined fidgeting with a device that doesnt work.

"Tengo que decir que luego de casi 6 meses de uso no tengo ninguna queja, sólo ventajas.

"Edit: Though I had a few issues, overall the headset still functions very well for the price and the customer service was exceptional. Helped me replace/refund the headset even though I was well past my window.I bought two of these when they were on sale. Both of them have the same issue with the mic: Though the headset stays plugged in and I can still hear everything fine, the mic will cut out and won’t turn back on until you adjust the aux cord. I have cut out SO many times in games and thought that my team was just ignoring me or being petty when they actually just... couldn’t hear me, because my mic is broken. I wanted to like this headset but the fact that I have this problem in TWO headsets is telling.",4,1,2020-5-10,1,3,0
Pros-great sound quality,5,1,2019-12-31,1,8,1
"I bought these a little over 6 months ago for my son with a natural talent for destroying headphones/headsets. The boy has averaged about 4-6 weeks lifespan regardless of quality or price, wired or wireless they all meet their ends quickly. These have survived over 6 months of intense use and abuse. I picked them up yesterday and was impressed to see they are still in one piece, no cracks or pieces dangling awkwardly. The cord is a bit frayed though I'm positive that simply from the onslaught of abuse they've endured. Comfort is good, sound is good, the braided cord is awesome and the whole thing is simply durable. These get used on the PS4, Xbox One and the PC daily with no problems. Definitely a solid choice for gamers who're extremely tough on their headsets.",5,1,2019-7-11,1,1,0
"$26 Look at ALL those reviews and stellar rating. Their true. Yeah, they're plastic so be responsible and don't treat them petulantly. DO NOT throw them in gaming frustration. Side effects=if you play CoD and use ALL SOUNDS feature (not just mic only for team) the experience is intense. My friend dropped more F-bombs in one hour than i've heard him say in 10 years bc it's a whole new thrilling experience. Personally, i started feeling 'carsick' when watching him play with no sound coming from TV-idk-i hadn't played in months tho. ps im trying to be humorous not cautionary  Enjoy  -edit- whoah Look at the plethora of 1 star ratings after Holyday! i will honestly update in near future should problems arrive. in the meantime grab my Soapbox. REALLY?!? Can that many headsets be bad? i see a pattern and it smells funny too. im sorry but i know how children behave during Holyday break. i reiterate my earliest points about personal responsibility. these headsets arrive on Safe Mode so you don't blow your eardrums. You MUST go into System Settings and adjust Mic settings and Volume settings like a diagnostic. when you find it, it's really quite awesome. the mic is so sweet you don't even need to pull it down like a TV broadcaster. you can leave it up in safer upright position and adjust settings to those specs. This many headsets cannot be faulty--maybe it's the reckless, impatient, temper tantrum in the room next door with too long a Holyday break that is to blame. Stop bad-mouthing Bengoo for an acceptable, affordable option to all the overpriced/expensive headsets that you undoubtedly would be moaning about too had you purchased them. You ain't getting your money back so stop complaining/begging and accept some personal responsibility. Happy New Year",5,1,2019-1-5,1,1,1
"Very good quality headset for the price. These are no turtle beaches but they are pretty close. I do not like how bulky they are but hey I hear game volume and game chat and they are super comfy. I also like how I can put these on for my XB1 and any PS4.

I used them as soon as I got them and tried them online and people stated that they heard me crystal clear. I would definitely recommend these. My only point is that they are wired, which is not terrible in any way, but be aware. For the price though, these are a no brainer.",5,1,2020-1-10,1,7,1

"***Update:  The company contacted me after the review and asked to make this right and send me a replacement.  I received the replacement as promised and product is functioning as described.  Changed rating to 4 stars, due to company turnaround and willingness to help and resolve the problem.***Promising at first not so much afterwards, what started off as a decent purchase, but less than two months old the cord where attached to the jack started to show serious quality conditions.  Contacted the company Bengoo which started off great with good communication, than communication breaks down as they promised with each and every reply they will make this right with the warranty.  Than the company went silent and never responded to resolve the issue.  Bottom line is product did not last two months, did not honor warrant and customer service is less than desirable.",4,1,2018-8-3,1,7,1
Amazing customer service. I had an issue with the 1st pair of head phones. I was happy with the sound quality and production value of the headphones; however the set I received was very tight against my ears causing them to hurt after only an hour our two. I posted a review of my experience and a BENGOO representative reached out to me. They sent a brand new pair at no additional expense and I am very happy with my new set. They fit properly and are very comfortable.They have great dynamic sound. I primarily use these for online gaming and am able to clearly identify if sneaking up behind me. The mic is very clear and cancels out background noise very well.,5,1,2018-2-22,1,2,0
"Listing stated that these DO NOT INCLUDE the 4-pin to dual 3-pin adapter to allow them to connect to a PC.  I ordered the adapter separately and when the headset arrived, an adapter WAS INCLUDED.  Good, but need to let people know this ahead of time.  Like the headset.  I have big ears and they are a little tight inside, but still better than what I was using.  They sound good and the mic has passed all of the tests that I can give it.",5,1,2018-3-16,1,2,0
So I wrote a previous review about how upset I was about the headset because it really is a great headset and I really loved it but then the mic randomly stopped working. Almost immediately after their customer service reached out to me and offered to replace the headset. I was honestly really surprised! They have great customer service and are definitely on top of making sure you get a great experience. I really appreciated it and am happy about getting the same headset again because I really did love it. It was comfortable with all the padding and noise cancelling which I need.

"Update: After customer service helped me with all my issues, I must say this headset is a great buy. It works GREAT on my Xbox one and only issues I had was with the longevity but that is not an issue anymore. The customer service was AMAZING and very speedy in helping me resolve my issue.Older Review: Lasted for seven months then left ear with mic started malfunctioning.  I took great care of headset with hanging it up and not dropping it. While this headset lasted, it was a great headset. Great volume, the mic was able to be moved vertically up and down, no static, and the cord was very lengthy.  The mic sometimes caused an echo in the Xbox party, but can be avoided by adjusting Xbox headset volume settings.  But other than that it was a great headset for the price.  I rated this mic three stars because of its longevity but other than that it was a good affordable headset.",5,1,2018-4-19,1,2,0

great sounding headphones. Had a problem with the first set I bought with sound cutting off. Advised them of the problem and was sent a new headset with no questions asked.

"This is the 2nd pair of Bengoo brand gaming headsets I purchased. The first one stopped working after 9 months. Before it died, I bought this one. This time with SquareTrade warranty. Headset stopped working after 6 months. SquareTrade doesn't kick in until the 12 month warranty expires. I tried repeatedly to contact seller (Bengoo). They keep sending me generic emails with no way to contact them directly. I'm done with this knockoff crap. I am going to spend more and get a name brand. If Bengoo contacts me to fix this issue, I will update my review.",1,1,2019-5-16,1,1,0
"UPDATE: they sent another for me to try and the microphone works much betterThe audio quality is great, but the microphone is this devices downfall. I have to have the dB boost on 20+ to really utilize it, and even then I get some background 'buzz'. It does it in any device I use it on too. Not bad enough that I won't use it, but sometimes people say it's buzzing and I have to mute/un-mute to make it stop. I think it might just be a ground issue at the connector. Either way, it fits the budget and works.",5,1,2018-4-2,1,4,0
"First of all, the customer support is AWESOME! - I got my headset a few days after I ordered it and it turned out that one side is not working so I notified them and right then and there they replaced it with a Red one(as I requested because it just goes along with my computer so good , lol), no questions asked. The first one was Blue and they both look AWESOME! I love the lights.Anyway, besides the awesome lights, this has got to be one of the most decent(sound wise/quality) and most awesome looking headsets out there and for a very sweet price. I mean a price like that for a headset like this is very cheap. I repeat...the price is very cheap for what this headphone's worth.",5,1,2018-4-12,1,3,1

"Overall it’s a good product, but I got this “free gift” letter in the amazon box saying if I wrote a good review (but if I  did not mention the gift) I would get a product of my choice or a 10 dollar gift card. This looks a lot like paid reviews (which would be illegal)",1,1,2020-6-15,1,1,1
"This is the worst physical design for a headset i think i’ve ever experienced... first of all, the headset itself is... heavy(?) can’t really think of a better description for it but it’s impossible to not immediately recognize you’re wearing a clunky piece of head gear while you’re playing... more over than that, why is this chord so LARGE and HEAVY and it has so many pieces to it - a GINORMOUS remote between the headset and the controller than handles the sound output to the headset - and then an external USB chord for.. what? Remove that, or give me an option to do it myself please.",1,1,2020-5-17,1,7,0
"they are ok, not the best. Low volume, mic is crap(UPDATE) Contacted then, Very Nice. They sent me a new Pair and they work fine now.  You Need to make sure you read about the Product before you buy (XBOX Info is in the Description). Granted these are not the best, but they work for the price you pay. Remember The good headset goes for 90 to 200 bucks, so their will be a trade off.",3,1,2018-12-23,1,1,0
"Original Review 3 Stars but after being harassed with emails by an employee to change or delete my HONEST review for a refund, I have decided to rate this 1 star. A review is a review; had this company messaged me a year earlier about a refund when I had BOUGHT this headset expressing their concern for me, perhaps I would have been more lenient and given this a 4 star at the time, but I don't even have this headset anymore, and in that year time period, it sat collecting dust until I finally junked it. I would not want to look through reviews, see the product is likeable, but then upon arrival it underperformed. I buy products constantly on Amazon and heavily rely upon reviews to influence whether I buy it or not. My review was not even ""bad,"" it genuinely expressed my opinion of the product.Original review below:",1,1,2019-1-26,1,6,0
"I don't usually write reviews. Here is my experience with this product. The headphones worked for my son for two days, then the sound coming through the headphones messed up. I'm not able to return this through Amazon. After contacting the company, I was sent a long list of troubleshooting things to try...blah, blah, blah. Then, when asked if that worked, I said no...and nothing. So, these headphones are in the trash, and I've purchased a new pair for my son. I won't buy these again. It  unfortunately was not a good experience. This is the first time I've ever had a disappointing experience with purchasing through Amazon.",1,1,2019-3-9,1,7,0
"First, I understand that this is a cheaper headset, but I had expectations none the less.  It just arrived and I will update the headset once I get to use it more.-The construction feels flimsy and cheap.  The expansion joints on the headset are clunky and feel like they could break.",1,1,2019-1-10,1,6,0
"I have had this product for less than two months and have been experiencing problems. I purchased this to use for a Play Station 4 and I wish I bought something else. First, the product is very misleading, the USB and Aux input is shared on the same cable and makes it annoying to play with. Second, whenever I have the headset connected to the controller I experience a lot of stick drift. Third and finally, I tried to return this product or get support but it apparently does not have amazon support and when I contacted the company I was unable to send an email due to unknown complications.Do not purchase this product. You are better of spending a little bit more money to get something of better quality.",1,1,2019-12-2,1,7,0
"So I actually like this headset. they are a little quieter than I would like bu the sound quality is good and the directional sound is on point. HOWEVER, The left side goes out if on max volume. I have to turn the wheel down slightly to get them both to work. So I figured I would buy another set as I would like to use both speakers on max. When I went to track down my order to reorder I noticed them all lit up. I thought it was just for pictures but it literally says LED lights and shows a picture of it lit up. MINE DOES NOT LIGHT UP. It's the same exact model and even has the blue spots for lights but it has never lit up. Due to this I am not buying another pair and will go find another headset",2,1,2019-12-17,1,5,0
"I bought these headphones for my son.  They worked for almost 2 days.  While they worked, he said the sound quality was great and his friends could hear him great.  I am now having big problems trying to get a replacement or refund.

"My son wanted these headphones so we gave them a shot.  They look really cool when lit up.  So far they work great.  Sound is good and microphone works well, too.  Came with an adapter to make them work with my son’s computer.  He wore them for several hours and never complained of discomfort.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,1,1
"I have been gaming for 25 years. I bought these for my son. These are the worst designed headphones I have ever seen. In order for it to light up you must plug it into a usb port, but in order for you to hear audio you need to plug another cord in the audio jack. That's all fine if you have a set up with both ports 1 inch apart from eachother but if you intend to use them on a playstation, xbox, or nintendo switch the you can forget having them light up. Instead you will just have an extra cord dangling all over your hands which is very irritating. The microphone also is not adjustable and we have yet to actually get it to work regardless of gaming system. Lastly, they just are not comfortable. Trash. I would compare these to a 10 dollar set of headphones from a dollar general. Honestly, the dollar general headphones my son had before were better. I don't care what the reviews say. These are terrible. They afe probably ok and only ok if you use them on a computer where the ports are inherently close.",1,1,2020-5-22,1,2,0
"This headset (I bought three) fits my adult head good. It also fits my six year old head comfortably according to him, and the third set is from my eight year old grandson. He says that it fits him nicely as well. The sound quality is very good. I noticed many new sounds from video games I had never heard before once I began wearing these. The kids can communicate through party chat across town with no issues. These were a great buy and I would definitely recommend BENGOO to anyone looking for a headset for an XBOX ONE.And... The customer service from this seller is great. I got a second email asking for my opinions after several weeks of ownership. They simply wanted to know if I was happy with the product and if not, how could they make it right. 5 stars from me for the extra mile.",5,1,2018-4-13,1,1,0
"I've been gaming all my life, and yet here I am as some twenty something and I have yet to purchase gaming headsets for a surround sound advantage to help immerse myself in games. So, looking at all the options I thought I had to purchase a $100+ headset just to get the effect I was looking for.However, when I stumbled on this product I was taken back by how too good it sounds. For the price it was offering it seemed too good to be true, but even with my doubts I went ahead and ordered. And thank god I did, because this was probably one of the best gaming purchases I've ever made.",5,1,2017-1-2,1,7,0
"I was worried about buying this because I would rather spend more and get a quality product, then buy double with a lesser first. The quality is much better than I expected. We have had it for a couple weeks now and my boys love it. (Used with XBox one) I love it because they are no longer shouting at their friends over FaceTime!",5,1,2018-6-7,1,1,0
I am skeptical about purchasing these but I am not what you would call a hard core gamer. I wanted something so that I could take to my friends while playing online with them and also something that would have decent sound quality. These are pretty awesome for the price. If I had to make one complaint on them is that the sounds doesn't go up as loud as I would like but at the same time it's so much better of an experience than playing the sound through our TV. Looking to possibly purchase a 2nd pair for when gaming with friends and husband!,5,1,2018-4-6,1,1,0
"I enjoy this headset, unfortunately, I had troubles getting it to work with my Xbox One so I don't think I can just plug it into my controller and go (READ EDIT). Good price for a budget headset that will do the job.EDIT: Upon swiftly and professionally receiving a replacement headset due to the defective nature (xbox incompatibility) of my first one delivered, I am greatly satisfied with this product. This headset is amazing for both consoles and PC, the sound is high quality and the microphone has very little background noise pickup and is very crisp in sound to your friends or associates!",5,1,2018-4-3,1,3,0
"I recently purchased the Bengoo G9000 headset.  I use all platforms for gaming and wanted a set that would work across all of them while still providing quality sound.  This headset accomplished that for me. This is also perhaps the most comfortable headset i have tried so far.  I can wear these for hours at a time without them hurting my head or ears.  The cord is a really nice braided cord that has a in-line volume control knob and a mute button.  An extra bonus to these headphones which i didn't think I would like so much is the LED's.  The styling and LED's are really appealing to see and makes it easy to find the headset after setting them down in the dark.  The microphone, according to my gaming friends, sounded good on our discord channel and in game voice chat.  The fact that the microphone can fold up and out of the way when not needed was also really nice.  I have had other headsets that had a detachable microphone that would always get lost, with this headset however, the microphone is always there but can  be out of the way when not in use.  I am sure the noice cancellation feature on this headset played a huge role in the sound quality of the microphone.  Perhaps though, my favorite part of this headset was the value, a sub $20 price point for this kind of quality is nice to see.  I will definitely be recommending this set to my friends and family.",5,1,2019-10-18,1,2,1
I ordered these for my son who is 8. He has went through 2 expensive sets of headphones that he had gotten for his birthday in march. so I didn't order anything expensive until he can take better care of things. So far they have lasted. He uses them on xbox 1. It has a long cord that you can make shorter with a velcro strap. Only problem is the led lights don't work unless plugged into a USB port. He still loves them. He likes that the mic is rigid and his friends can hear him well. He's happy. I'm happy.,5,1,2018-8-6,1,1,0
My headset arrived right on schedule with no issues. I'll list pros and cons below.•PROS:,4,1,2017-6-7,1,1,0
"I bought this for my son who like any child his age, likes to play games on his devices. I have tried with those cheap cords and honestly they are frustrating to say the least. Doesn't last long and sounds like crap. He actually looked around here on Amazon and settled for this one, I didn't question him because well it's for him and the price was not bad. He really wanted another one but said it was too expensive. When I received it, he immediately started using it, right in the car with his tablet. The first thing that surprised me was how light it was. It  is really light but it is not flimsy. It is not very hard and unyielding but it is sturdy enough. What I liked also liked was the quality of the cord. It is thicker than I thought it would be and the ends came covered with a plastic cover. The USB part is to power up the LEDs on the headphone. It doesn't affect the performance in any way, it can be used without it. He talked to his friends online and he says they said the quality is very good. The sound is what he likes also. He says the bass is not too loud and 'drowning', it is just right for him. I tried it myself to play a game and I was impressed. I am very finicky when it comes to quality of music and sound effects and so on, so when I say I was impressed, that is not to be taken lightly. It is not a Bose headphones, so don't expect to pay this price and get Bose quality and volume.but it is quite good, don't underestimate it. It's a good gamers' startup headphone or for your average to avid gamer. Overall I am pleased with this purchase and if there are any issues with it, be sure that I will state them here. This is a good purchase for the price and quality that you are getting.",5,1,2018-8-16,1,1,0
"So, I have a fair amount to talk about regarding this headset. There are pros, there are cons, and there are things that I do believe are not amazing and seem a bit sketchy.To start off, the pros.",1,1,2020-7-15,1,3,0
This headset started off ok but then kept cutting in and out and now has stopped working completely after one month for our xbox one and when it did work others kept complaining there was echoing and hard to hear. Wish I never spent any money on this and now cant even return. Tried it on 3 different controllers. Really am baffled why it has over 10.000 reviews and such a high rating. Maybe they started good quality but I Just bought this in late august 2019 and now it doesn't work with my controllers.,1,1,2019-9-11,1,3,0
"It shipped right on time and is just what I was wanting. The design is lightweight and very comfortable if you're going to wearing them for a while. The cord is long and the sound is amazing. The only problem I have with these if that the USB is too close to the mic part, so you can't use the lights and the mic at the same time with PS4. Other than that, I would definitely recommend these if you're into gaming like I am or if you're just looking for a good set of headphones for other purposes as well.",5,1,2017-8-9,1,2,1

Here is the reason why they have so many positive reviews:They offer a free gift for a positive review and they say to not mention that your are reviewing for the free gift and majority of these reviewers are not updating their reviews because the second part of the scam is that they don't send the free item. I purchased these a month ago.,1,1,2020-6-17,1,4,0
"I bought these for my son because a friend of his stole his expensive ones. I bought these as an inexpensive replacement and my son says he likes these better than his old ones. My son says he likes the sound and uses these with the PS4 and his iPhone, the lights on the side look cool but only work when the power for these is plugged in with the USB power. This is all the USB does, it only provides power for the lights on the headphone sides.",5,1,2017-11-12,1,1,0
"I bought this for my 11 year old son. He loves it! The colors are great, headset is comfortable and great a beginning gamer. I must have missed one important detail when I read the reviews. For PS4, the are two inserts. A USB the plugs into the PS4, needed in order for the headset to light up. The other is 3.5mm cord that plugs into the controller. I would recommend ordering an extender otherwise, the player has to sit right next to the PS4. You cannot extend the cord. Otherwise, for the price, this is a great headset. The mic is clear and the base for the video games is also a nice surprise for the price.",5,1,2018-3-13,1,3,0
"Update: I received my refund one year laterI hope you never have to go through what I did with this headset. I bought it one year ago and it didn’t work whatsoever straight from the box. I wrote a review and was emailed approximately 6 times from 6 different people. Every time they asked me to remove my negative review without offering a refund. As they grew more desperate for me to remove my review, they offered a higher return price. I was once offered double the amount of what I paid for the headset, but was never given it. I finally temporarily deleted my comment just to receive some form of a return. Please save yourself the trouble I went through and don’t get this headset. It doesn’t work no mater how many times you call their support.",1,1,2020-5-30,1,2,0
"I have never used a gaming headset before. I'm a PC gamer, but don't do a lot of multiplayer stuff (no FPS's for me), so never had a need to communicate with anyone in-game, and was always satisfied with the sound from my speakers. I got these because my PC is in my living room now, right next to where my boyfriend has his PS4 set up, so gaming at the same time is somewhat of an issue sound-wise. I plugged these in last night and loaded up Witcher 3 and I was BLOWN AWAY by how much BETTER the sound was than my speakers had been! I mean, sure, the sound is now DIRECTLY next to my ears, but still. I am super impressed and kind of mad that I haven't been using headphones for years. The headphones are surprisingly light for their size, and very comfortable even after several hours of play time. I'm SURE more expensive models have way better sound and more complete noise cancelling, but these were perfect for my needs and my budget and they really do sound great. Over 10,000 reviews can't be wrong, right?",5,1,2020-4-14,1,2,0
"bought this for my 10 year old grandson for Christmas, was not sure what I was getting... it turns out he uses the mic on the headset to chat with friends while they are playing video games.... who knew????? that gift was a hit and he hasn't taken it off since Christmas",5,1,2018-2-5,1,1,0

"I wanted to give these enough time to make sure that my review was accurate about the headphones. My son is very pleased with them. I tried them on, just to see how they felt and sounded. They are very comfortable and the sound quality is just as good as the name brand pairs that I paid over $100 for. These aren't cheap or flimsy feeling at all. My son uses these daily and so far, he's not had any issues with echoing or interference with the mic. He uses these with his gaming PC and Nintendo switch. The headset did come with an adapter to plug into the PC. As far as the lights on it, they work fine. They do have to be plugged into a separate USB to light up, but he doesn't really care about that, and the lights have nothing to do with the headset's operation. The lights are a nice addition for children or to add ambience to gaming. For the price, I think these are great! He's had Turtle Beach and Sony headphones, that were way more expensive. None of them have lasted even a year. He is happier with these than any other set he's had. If these last 3 or 4 months, I would still buy them again. Just because it would still be cheaper than buying a pair that cost $120 or more that dont last a year. To be honest, I believe these will last as long as the others, if not longer. Because they seem to be made better than the sets he's had in the past. If you are looking for a pair of inexpensive headphones with a mic, give these a try. They will exceed the quality you would expect. I will update my review if any problems occur in the next couple months. As of right now, I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend them.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,2,0
"As soon as we could see that learning at home was going to be the reality for the spring, I ordered this headset for my kids to use with class videos and Zoom calls. At ages 12 and 7, they feel really cool with the gaming lights on the sides (though those won't work with an iPad, most of their work so far is on Chromebooks, so it's easy to plug in USB and headset cords), and that seems to be the extra edge that gets them to use the headsets by choice. This has made it much easier for everyone else in the house to stay on top of their own tasks.Sound quality is quite good, including better-than-expected passive noise cancellation (which is great for keeping e-learners from getting distracted). Build quality is also better than expected, especially at this price point.",5,1,2020-4-2,1,2,0
"**Orginal review**Fit ok, hurt my ears after an hour or so of use. It had an echo when using them with Xbox One chat. Sent them back.",5,1,2017-11-7,1,1,0
"Fairly snug and comfortable with quality audio and stereo effects.  As with most headsets of this type, it's a little frustrating that the USB plug is tied to the audio jack with only about 6 inches of separation so if you plan to use the LED, you will have to find a way to extend the length of the USB cable or something.There is probably some obvious way to do this but the means escapes me at this time.  So, overall it's a great product so far.  I took out the additional insurance  because I've had these headsets just develop issues after about 6 months with typical use.  So, we will wait and see ...",5,1,2018-1-24,1,1,0
"I was really excited to gift this headset to my daughter especially because the lights looked cool in the photos.  However, now that she has opened them, we noticed the only way to keep the lights on is if it is plugged into a USB port :(I feel the description was misleading.",3,1,2019-12-6,1,3,1
This gaming head set comes in so many great colors but the quality is what I'm most impressed with. The bass surround sound gives you the feeling of actually being inside the game. Has soft flexible mic which I like because we've lost a pair of headphones or 2 because of over excitment and they snapped the mic right off. 1.Extra Microsoft adapter ( Not Included) is needed when connect with old version Xbox One controller.2.1-to-2 3.5mm jack splitter cable ( Not Included) is needed when you connect with PC if you want to use headphone and microphone at the same time.,5,1,2019-12-18,1,2,1
"So I got this headset. The sound quality sucked. But the microphone was significantly better than what I had. So I kept it to use it only as a microphone. The microphone worked just fine for about a week. Then it stopped working. I tested it and all I got was static. So I emailed the seller and never got a response. So then I called amazon and they told me to expect an email from the seller within one to two days. I never got an email from the seller. So I just called amazon again and I got a refund. Props to amazon. I’ve been calling them a lot lately for this and other orders and they’ve been nothing but friendly and helpful. So if you’re even thinking about buying this, don’t do it. Stay as far away from this as possible.",1,1,2019-9-18,1,5,0

"This thing is incredible. I really was a little hesitant, with the price being so low. But I'm glad I went ahead and made the purchase! I got the camo pair, and I love them! The sound quality is great! And I haven't had complaints from my friends saying they can't hear me, or that there is any feedback from the mic.The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because the ad says noise canceling, but they're definitely not noise  canceling. I could still hear things in my house while I'm playing clearly, this isn't a big deal for me, so I'm not very upset about this. The second thing is the plastic is very cheap plastic, and would break easily if mishandled. This isn't a problem for me. But if you're getting this for a young son or daughter that may be a little reckless with their belongings, then I would encourage you to look elsewhere.",4,1,2017-11-21,1,3,0
Only had it for about a week now. My first impression is that it looks very good! Seems to be built well (but like i said haven't had it very long). Sound quality is very good and is very comfortable to wear. Mic is working fine so far and haven't had any problems with echoing or anything... Love it so far.,5,1,2017-11-23,1,1,0
"Very happy I gambled with this product. For the price it's awesome! Great sound in Call of Duty II, I can hear people walking around in hardcore Search..They are really lite and somewhat cheap feeling (?) and not sure how mic quality is for people but I seemed to hold convos online just fine.",5,1,2017-11-9,1,1,0
"I bought these for my son's birthday. Let's go over some stuff I really liked. Lighting. I'm not a novice to led lighting and it can be obnoxiously bright especially when you have it on the side of your head! I was Leary at first because I had the picture of ""playing fortnite late in a dark room"" but they really did a great job of making the light bright but not at all obnoxious. It glows bright enough to be cool but not squint bright. OK enough about the light. Sound was good. I could still hear my youngest son in the background yelling but it didn't distract me from the game. I put in Asassins creed where you have to rely on sound coming from certain directions and the headset performed well. It was much better than the earbuds I was using. Comfort was good. It was soft and didn't squeeze my head but it was a tad hot. Granted I have a big head so that may be a factor haha. I'd like to see maybe a bit longer cord but overall for the price I was surprised to get such a nice headset. My oldest son wants one now. And I think I might want one too. It doesn't feel cheap or plasticky either. If you are still reading this I don't think you'll find a better headset for the price. Definitely recommend it.",5,1,2019-10-3,1,1,0
"Mic did not work out of box.  Reviewing product questions, this appears to be a COMMON, persistent problem with unanswered reports dating back a significant period.Device has a 3.5mm aux out as well as USB out.  Came with an AUX splitter included.  I'm unclear whether the USB port is supposed to work with computers at all, or if that is for consoles only.  USB did not work plug and play, and I was not able to find any software support that would make USB work... but maybe that's by design.",1,1,2020-9-30,1,1,0
"Quality of this product really sucked. Low grade materials actually started causing a hotspot on my head and soon after pain. The noise cancellation was the best quality of this. Couldn’t hear a damn thing other than the sound when they were on. But on that note, when plugged into my Xbox controller, this caused an unbelievably annoying echo effect for myself or the people I was playing with, to the point where we would just use a phone call to try and communicate rather than using the headset. After about 3 weeks the wires in the cord were obviously loose in the wrapping material because I couldn’t get any sound out of them what so ever. Overall not a good product, would not buy again, definitely not recommending this to anyone. Spend money on a good set of headphones or earbuds with a mic attached.",1,1,2019-1-3,1,5,0
"I mistakenly ordered this headset, not realizing that the headphones required 3.5mm connections for the headphones and microphone.  I rushed and thought that the USB connection would provide an either/or option.  The USB connection is just to power the LED lights.Next, it turns out that my system doesn't have a microphone jack.  Back to Amazon to find USB to audio converters that support 3.5mm connections for both microphone and headphone.",4,1,2020-3-29,1,1,0
"EDITED REVIEW....I am changing my rating to 4 stars because the seller contacted me on their own and completely refunded my money. While the headset did not last as long as I expected it to, any company that is willing to stand behind a product like that is worthy of a second chance. Like I said in my original review, the headset did work well while it was working so if the seller is going to back their product like they do, I’d definitely recommend trying it. My kiddos said it was comfortable and thought it “looked cool.”",4,1,2019-10-26,1,1,0
"Just got this headset for use with my PS4 Pro. It's my first set and works great so far. I can hear everyone clearly and they can hear me clearly. One thing I noticed after it arrived was that the USB plug in is for the led lighting only. There are no batteries in this headset so it will cause the controller to drain a bit faster. It's very affordable amd seems to have great construction for only $25. I know it says BENGOO as the brand name but I recieved KOTION EACH model G9000. Not sure if one company bought out the other or if the chinese comapany changed it's name for legal reasons. I highly recommend this product for a beginner or if you're just not into spending a lot for a headset. Like I said, this is my first set and it wirks well so far so I see no need to spend $50 or $100+ on a name brand set. If anything goes wrong soon I will edit my review.",5,1,2020-2-12,1,1,0
"We were looking for a good headset that wouldn't break the bank and was of good quality. I just searched for gaming headphones on amazon and this was the top result, now I see why! The sound quality was great, letting me hear the footsteps of the enemy in games like Call of Duty as well as enjoy the music and dialogue of other games like Assassins Creed Odyssey.I wasn't expecting the headset to last very long but even with the low price point it has a rather high quality.

I purchased this headset originally because mine broke an I needed a replacement but I was low on funds.  The most inexpensive headset I could find locally was close to $50 dollars so I paid less without high expectations.  I was very surprised with this product.  the sound quality is perfect.  I was like having surround sound installed when listening.  The padding was very comfortable and it blocks outside static.  Generally my ears hurt after extended usage of any devices on my ears but this headset was not invasive at all.  To make things better I didn't have to go broke purchasing them because the price was also reasonable.  I am very happy with this purchase and definitely recommend this product.  The only negative I could see was the hard material that the microphone is made with not allowing any flex but it works perfectly so it isn't a problem at all just less convenient.,5,1,2020-1-13,1,1,1
"Recieved this in the mail yesterday. Shipping was fast if course, its amazon. My sons goes through these pretty quick so I usually buy cheaper ones. I saw the reviews on this one and for the price I took a stab at it. To my surprise the headset was pretty darn comfortable and sounded darn good. I am not a gamer but I know my tunes. Either way. I gave it to my son to try and this morning he came down stairs and said they sounded great. The bass was deep and the sound was clear. This is coming from a kid who refuses to use anything but Dr Dre beats. The only thing he mentioned was the cord was a little long. On that note, we are very pleased with this purchase.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,1,1
"Headphones seemed to be of good quality and had excellent speakers and microphone. Unfortunately the product ceased to work within 2 months of use. The seller stands behind their product however, and offered a replacement, but I already bought a different headset.I have upgraded from 2 to 3 stars to reflect the sellers confidence in their product, while still giving an honest review of the product.",3,1,2018-8-16,1,5,0
"This headset is a great option at this price point.  The sound was clear.  It did come with an adapter to use on the computer with separate mic and audio plugs (I mention this because at the time I purchased it, the  listing seemed to indicate that this was not included - so while not a guarantee, there is a chance future orders will contain this as well) .  The headset is very comfortable, though it does not have the solid feel of one that will cost more.  It fits my smaller head on the smallest setting, and I feel it would fit maybe kids 10+ decently.  It does stretch decently to fit larger heads as well.  If you are looking for a headset in this price range, it is a good buy.  If you are used to a little pricier headsets, but want something less expensive, this will deliver on most points.  I just wish there were a clip on the piece where the mute and volume are, as the cord is a little heavy and a clip would make that less noticeable.",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"I purchased this headset for my 11-year-old son to use with his Xbox. After using it for about a week, he gives it 4 stars. The noise cancellation is not the best, but it's also not the worst. I actually like it because he can hear his game just fine, but if I try to talk to him while he's using them, he can still hear me.The headset is comfortable. I don't think the cushion around the ears is as soft as the Turtle Beach headset that he had before this one, but it still is fine. The cushion on the top part of the headset is thick and soft. Very comfortable.",4,1,2020-3-2,1,2,0

**Update*** I bought this headset for my son for his birthday and he’s used it a handful of times over the past 3 weeks and suddenly the mic stopped working. He has 2 really great audio headsets so I bought this specifically for the mic to talk while playing fortnite (he uses his blue tooth headset for everything else) and now it’s completely useless since no one can hear him at all. Ive tried everything I can think of to fix it including trying it on other devices but no luck. I bought this for all of the great reviews I read but when I looked more closely I see this is a common occurrence so I definitely would NOT recommend this at all!!!! What an waste of money and I literally just missed the 30 day return window.I bought this gaming headset for my 11 year old and he says it’s awesome! He says it’s extremely comfortable even when wearing long periods of time. He says the mic and volume control work great and he loves the overall appearance of it. His brother has a different name brand headset but he says his is “cooler” looking so win win for mom!,1,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
I purchased this product recently to be able to do online gaming w/ the X-Box One. After receiving it I was disappointed in the fit (Very Tight on your head) after about 30-45 minutes it became painful to wear.But most disappointing w/ this headset was how inconsistent the headphone connection was (connection was loose),1,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0

These headphones NEVER worked. I have them at my home for my grandson. He uses his phone to hear his friends!! I didn’t realize this. He needs another pair so these were not a good purchase.

"I bought these headphones for use with our Xbox One about a month ago and various members of our household have used them about every other day since then. These headphones fit an adult head comfortably; they seem a little big on our 8-year-old's head, but she says they are comfortable and likes wearing them. These headphones plug into our wireless Xbox controller with no issues—they don't light up when used with the Xbox One, because there's nowhere to insert the USB plug into the controller, but that's not a big deal for us. The sound quality is good, and they block out household noise well. We haven't used the mic yet, since we mostly use these headphones so that game soundtracks don't bug non-playing household members, and they are perfect for that purpose. As far as the features we use go, these headphones have done exactly what we wanted them to, and they're a great value.",5,1,2020-2-27,1,1,0
"It was a great headset for the price. My son had one that when his dad would come in, he couldnt mute his mic before he started getting on to him for not doing his chore. So he earned 40 dollars so he would not be embarrassed by his father anymore. I came on here in search of one with both earsets and one that the Mic can slide . the cancelling works great cuz now his dad has to tap him to be heard and the mic can be muted before the reprimand. Lmao but fr. Good price, good headset, happy teen. Update: one of the speakers didnt work after a week and i dont know what the Mic lifting does becuase it doesnt mute immediately like we both thought. I wont buy again.",2,1,2020-6-23,1,1,0
"First of all, this company sends free items for every 5 star review, so take the 5s with a grain of salt.Secondly, the headphones function fine for audio, but no one can hear you via the mic. I tried everything to troubleshoot, and eventually took the headphones off and spoke directly into the mic. Lo and behold, it worked. This means the mic is unable to pick up your voice under normal conditions and the mic can't adjust its x-axis orientation, so you're stuck being unheard. I did some research and learned that a great deal of ""gaming headsets"" are just packaged cheap garbage. I will be returning these because they are unusable for me",1,1,2020-6-19,1,2,0

"Get this:  we just spent 100 bucks on another ""professional"" microphone for recording voice that my husband uses to record coaching and voice lessons, singing, etc.  It didn't work and kept disconnecting from my recording software .. I got frustrated and bought this with extreme trepidation.Ok, as a result, I took a long time researching a headset with a microphone that I intended on using for recording tutorials for my teaching.  I kept running into compatibility issues with various selections, or I could find headsets but not microphones, etc.  Then I saw this and I had reservations because it also supports gaming and thought it might be too high end or technology-heavy for what I need.  Well, fear gone with one plug.  It literally was out-of-box ready-plug-and-play.  The sound is amazing both recording and playback (see the first pic) and it worked with my recording software with no problem (see the second pic) with one setting change (microphone setting) on both output and input and voila .. ready to record.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,1
"They work ok but ours won't light up. We plugged it into the ps4 remote and into the ps4 but it doesn't light up. Also the part that plugs into the remote and the part that plugs into the ps4 has almost no length to it so if you do plug it into both, you have to be SUPER close to the ps4. If you only plug it into the remote, you can sit anywhere and play. The splitter for the rca jack and the part that plugs into the front has only 7 inches of clearance! So if you want it to light up, if you are lucky enough to get a set that does light up, you have to sit a maximum of 7 inches from your playstation. That's ridiculous! The chat volume control doesn't work that great either. We adjust it up but it doesn't seem to increase the volume until you max it out and then it gets a little too loud. If I had to do it over again I would go with a different set. They get 2 stars because they work somewhat.UPDATE: They contacted me and sent me a new set and these light up! The 1st pair was defective. If you want them to light up when you use them, you still have to buy a usb extension cable or you can only sit about 12 inches away from the PS4. The usb cable is just too short.",4,1,2018-12-27,1,1,0
"These headphones were good for about 2 months then started losing the mic connection.  3rd month, there was no mic.  4 months in, my son can't hear sound from both sides.

"While sound and connections were fine, the dongle is larger than most. I also was totally unaware these were ""noise cancelling"" until I read the title of this product just before writing this review (2 years later). They cancel noise by virtue of covering your ears, no sound technology employed. The cord itself is unusually thick and has a stiff, rough, woven cover that is exceptionally prone to what I call, ""pretzeling."" Like an old garden hose, any movement, picking it up, putting it down on your desk, cause it to slowly twist and braid itself. Eventually this caused the wires to break as it would also twist at the place where the cord connect to the actual headphone.In the photo above, I did not manipulate or twist the cord, the stiff woven covering likes to twist itself, and each time it does, it becomes even more prone to twisting. Even after smoothing it and setting it on the counter, it coils in on itself. I have had to stop listening to music or playing games to unplug, smooth, and untwist the cord so it wasn't yanking on my head.",2,1,2020-9-18,1,0,1
"The reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it did last 6 months. But nevertheless, when buying a product you want it to last a long time, especially when you take care of it so well. The sound started shorting out and cutting in and out, as well as, interrupting your speech while in use. If you are fine with buying a new headset 2-3 times a year for $20-30 a pop then this headset is good for you. I will be spending a little more this time to have a product that lasts at least a year.",2,1,2019-8-5,1,3,0

"I originally needed a quick fix as my old gaming headset was well over due, my alternative of a quick fix was something obviously cheap yet  durable for temporary use until I can get a Fnatic React headset. Anyways I said the hell with it and bought it. That was my first mistake, my second mistake was trying to keep it for a week just telling myself “it’s ganna be okay”. I wouldn’t recommend for competitive gamers : reason being, I play games with my headset FULL volume and I’ll tell you! I have been a laughing stock for a past week because everyone in chat/party/lobby can hear echoes through this headsets mic. So embarrassing enough that the mute dail on the cord doesn’t even work. At times I had to exclude myself in a party alone so I didn’t mess with anyone’s competitive gaming or get kicked or reported.It’s my opinion but save your money cause this headset is baloney. I’m returning this since they’ll probably refurbish it for the next individual that stumbles across a “BEST SELLER”.",1,1,2020-1-9,1,3,1
"I purchased this headset as my old turtle beach headset was broken after 6 years of use. I looked for a cheaper option as I didn’t know with the new xbox on the horizon how the headset was going to work. I knew this headset was cheap, but this is something that I wouldn’t touch if I didn’t have to. First off, the package arrived with just the shipping label on the box. While this could’ve just been Amazon, someone could easily see what it is and swipe it off of my porch. Second off, this headset will not work on a gaming console. The USB to connect to the console and the AUX to connect to the controller are connected. That means that you would have to have the controller within 6 inches of the USB port to work. This leaves it unplayable. I purchased this headset as a budget option, but I was left with a $40 hole in my wallet.",1,1,2020-6-9,1,1,0
"While not cheap,  they weren't expensive by any stretch of the imagination.  But I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box and took out the headphones.  Then I grabbed my laptop and started it up, plugged it in and plugged in the USB connection and watched the blue LED turn on in the ear pieces! To be honest I hadn't noticed the USB when I ordered them and was confused when I saw the connector.  I was like a little kid at Christmas!  I hurriedly put them on, made sure settings were right an was busy for 4 hours. Noice cancelling was awesome andI wear hearing aids and when I took the headphones off there wasn't even a hint that I was going to have issues with sore ears during longer play time.",5,1,2020-2-28,1,1,0

"This is the first gaming headset I have ever purchased.  I picked this one because it had good reviews and was a style I like.  I have to say it has not disappointed at all.  The sound quality is excellent, my ears fit inside the sides which I have never had before (all my other head phones were either in ear or rested on the outside of my ear) and is so much more comfortable.  The cord is rather long which is great, because my Tower is a bit away from where I actually sit.  I also use this headset to record videos and the microphone picks up the sound wonderfully, I personally like the fixed mic just because then it is always out of my way and I never have to readjust it.  The only thing I would like to have added would be that the sound controller should have a clipping mechanism.  Right now it just hangs by my side or in my lap, I would prefer it to be lower on the cord and be able to clip it to my belt loops, then I know it is out of the way.",5,1,2020-7-30,1,1,0
"I went searching for new headsets recently and none of them compare to the sound quality on this one. The reason definitely seems to be the fact that these are two-way speakers, as the lows on other headsets are completely cut off by comparison. Not this one. The bass is not overkill, but it is a capable headset that can produce bass when needed, and it makes the audio experience entirely different with anything that has even a remote amount of lows to it. I also like the fact that it has a three way (mic + stereo) connector by default, as well as an included adapter in the box for splitting this into separate mic and headphone inputs/outputs if needed. The volume control and mic muter is nice and they are lightweight and comfortable to wear. I also like how smooth the mic attachment is, making it easy to move it closer to the mouth when needed. This headset is a steal, as I have seen far inferior products for the same price or higher without nearly the same level of audio quality. I am very happy with my purchase!Edit: Just wanted to add that I have tried ""two-way"" headphones and they still do not compare to this headset in terms of bass. I believe now that this is due to the dual-subwoofers built in to this headset. It's simply amazing. You can actually feel the audio a bit, even at normal levels.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,1,0
"For an intro gaming set you can't beat the price. The nylon cord is a built really well and comes with the adapter. Wish the USB gave you more sound optimization instead of just being a power source for LED lights. The headset is built extremely well. I played with it on for a good 6 hours and  didn't feel like it was squishing my head or ears. The mic is clear and concise. Volume control on the cord for the headset is built extremely well. This headset could definitely take a beating. You can definitely tell a difference between when your gaming (Great Highs, Mids, And Lows) I wouldn't recommend this headset for music and if your an audiophile it will drive you nuts with the transition difference in tones to me it sounds (dampened) If your looking for a gaming headset though look no further you found a keeper.",5,1,2019-12-13,1,1,1
"love it since I finally was able to see how pretty it is, once you plug in the cord onto the back of the xbox my grandson said it was very kool. lol he bugged me so bad about using it that I had to hand it over and get me another one in fact I have ordered a few of them, that's how much I liked the product, it was my mistake on asking to return this item due to the LED light not working that was my mistakes it works just not at the same time as being able to chat when online. This headset is labeled by the company as being compatible with an xbox1, that is not true, you can not have both jacks plugged in at the same time, to chat and be lit up I had to wait to take my headset into our local gamestop to verify what I already new. But I will keep the headset anyway but im not happy with it because I could have just purchased an ordinary headset from the beginning, why have a lit up headset but you can't chat but if you want to chat you got to switch out the jacks. I am not happy at all now that I know for sure the headset can't do both.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
"I bought these in dec 2018, initially the worked great but after a month or so the headset would just cut out in the middle of gaming. The ability to use these are intermittent at best, playing fortnite it’s very frustrating. I have them wired to a controller. Initially I thought it was the controller so I kept switching because I own 4, then I bought a brand new controller and had same issues. No sound, cuts in and out. When turned on the sound is dismal I can’t even turn them up anymore when the are working. I am upset seeing as I spent 100+ on a headset that doesn’t work after a few months.",1,1,2019-1-20,1,3,0

I've only had it a few days and while it does work, its cheap plastic that I don't expect to last long and the sound it just as bad.

"I love sound of the headphone. It seems very crisp and clear. When I was playing Call of Duty, I was able to hear footstep from farther distance compare to other headphone I've used. The other people tells me that they can hear my voice much better than my previous headphone. One thing I would change is the wiring which is on the microphone side. I often adjust my microphone when I am excited LOUD and when I do, my hand gets caught with the wire. It may take some time for me to get used to it. The lighting of the headphone is really cool especially since I usually play with all the lights off in the room. This comes with adapter for older models that requires separate microphone/headphone port.I would like to be able to move the wire which means having 3mm port on either side, so people can plug in whichever side they would be comfortable. While this headphone is loud enough, I would like it to be louder just to block out the outside sound.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,1,1

These were the second set I purchased and the first set was about 2 years ago so from what I have read thats a ""long life"" for a headset.  The lights seen on the side my son cant use because his system is under the desk.  There is 1 ""plug"" for sound and then a second plug that is on the same wire as the first and just cant reach to my son to work...but they cant see it anyway..lol!

"Received these a couple weeks ago ,but have been away from home. When I took them out the package, they looked like a good headset, I like the cable quality and the look of them.

The Microphone does not work at all on this headset, I went to forums to see if there was a trick to get these working.... no ....and is a fairly common problem with this headset. Do not buy. I regret it. BTW I have had dozens of headsets, stream daily when home, and record music regularly, this isn't my first rodeo with headsets.",1,1,2019-10-17,1,3,0
"My son used this headset for gaming and listening to music for two years. He always thought the sound wasn't great. Now I know why:The cable got nicked at the jack with use. Being an electronics guy, I wanted to replace the jack rather than trash the entire headset. Big surprise when I exposed the wires and found only three going to the jack. (And yes, I went farther and farther back to find the elusive 4th wire. Not there!)",1,1,2020-5-10,1,2,0
"This headset is one of the best I have ever purchased. While I liked the pink I purchased in blue because the price difference simply wasn't worth it to me to have a different color. The price is great and they look nice. There is padding under the part that rests on top of your head which is super comfortable and the headband is adjustable. They are noise canceling and sound quality is excellent. When u have them turned up I can not hear anything around me which is perfect for serious gamers so that you can focus on gameplay. I am a call of duty gamer on PS4 and the headset takes the game to a whole different level because you can actually hear individual noises from left or right and good bass quality. There is a switch on the cord to adjust volume and turn on and off the mic. Mic quality is awesome no buzzing, humming or crackling. The only thing I am confused about is the light up part. There is a headphone jack and a USB port at the bottom of the cord. The headset only lights up when you have the USB port plugged in but for PS4 to have the headset plugged into the controller you can not plug the USB into the PS4 without being directly ontop of the console which leaves you no room to move the controller while playing because the cord is split at the bottom for the different plug instead and it's not spread out enough to have the length to have both plugged in. It's not a deal breaker for me but maybe because of the design the light up aspect is better for PC gamers. The light up detail is nice but not necessary to game obviously. All in all the headset is perfect and super sturdy and comfortable. Best one I have ever bought and works perfect for cod on ps4. I definetly recommend to gamers but like I said before just keep in mind that it may be hard for you to use it and also use the light up feature if you are using PS4, Xbox etc. Overall it is awesome, cheapest headset I've ever bought and definetly best quality.",5,1,2019-11-12,1,1,0
"I bought this for my son to do virtual school.  First off, it's very ""cool"" looking with the LED lights. So, that's a win.  It fits comfortably on his head even though he's still small.

It also has an integrated volume control and mute button on the wire.",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"If I was buying this headset for the reason of hearing footsteps and dialogue in game then these would be perfect. However, I bought these for that along with using the mic online and to have them light up like they advertise. If I’m not holding the wire in the usb then the headphones don’t light up. The mic doesn’t work and I ended up having to buy an extension cable to plug in for the wire to reach my controller. I use these headphones for my PS4 like advertised and although it works great to canc our the noise while my daughter is sleeping it doesn’t serve the whole purpose of why I bought them.

This headset though isn't perfect is actually really good for the price.As a side note, there are LED lights that light up only when the USB is plugged into something. Which is all the URB plus is really there for. It doesn't really have anything to do with the headset otherwise. I think the lights are more for aesthetic purposes. Pointless in my case but I think is a nice touch.",5,1,2019-6-7,1,1,0
I’ve been a gamer for most of my life.  Some people would assume I’m not a gamer because of how little I play lately.  I recently got a new computer and I decided to upgrade my headset. (In all honestly my old headset ran away).  I play mostly 1 player games such as the Sims or a few games on Steam.  Every now and again I open up Starcraft 2 and play some but not as much as I used to mainly due to life.  So far this headset is really good.  I am able to hear thing around me in the game  easier than when I was just relying on the speakers and my husband isn’t telling me to turn it down because he can’t hear the tv.

It appears that the wording is a little weird. But I figured it was because they are Chinese and there was trouble translating. Like when they say ""Choose One You Like"" and not ""Choose 'The' One You Like.""On the card, it says: ""You could see the gift information on the right and choose one of them."" But when you go to the site, the shady-looking site, it says",1,1,2020-9-23,1,1,0
The cord is nicely made. The controls simple and works great for teleworking as well as gaming. Looks like it will last some time.UPDATE: the headset has stopped functioning properly. You have to play with the wire going into your device to get both speakers to work. I have tried it with several different devices to ensure that it wasn't the device malfunctioning. I will provide another update after I get in touch with customer service.,5,1,2020-4-20,1,1,0
"I bought these recently, mainly to use as gaming and streaming headphones, but also to record and listen to music. I'll start with the pros:The sound quality is great. I have no complaints whatsoever about not being able to hear things. There are a few basslines in songs I listen to that I had not heard before using these headphones.",5,1,2018-12-19,1,1,0
"We bought this as a gaming headset and my son bought it with his money. It was delivered January 19th. Today is March 10th, so not even 60 days and it took a crap. (We are past the Amazon return period but didn’t start to have problems until afte that time fram) First if you touch the auxiliary cord while in use it would cause the volume to shut off, then it got to a point it was just ridiculous and not tolerable because he was constantly trying to get his volume on and then imagine what happened next the microphone quit working. This is a piece of crap, do not buy it as it is a total waste of $$$. I would like to as the question as to what good do gaming headsets do it you have no volume or you are unable to speak to opponents???? After 50 days, NO VOLUME AND NO MICROPHONE = TERRIBLE HEADSEAT!!!!",1,1,2019-3-10,1,3,0
"I was looking for a good gaming headset. The reviews on this product were positive so I placed the order. I spent two nights trying to get the mic to work. During the process, some comments on website forums confirmed what I was experiencing. Mic problems seem to be a problem with this headset. The directions are on a small piece of paper and are useless. The size of the print is so small it's impossible to read and I couldn't find any phone number for tech support. I will be returning the headset to Amazon tomorrow. I'm disappointed and do not recommend the product.",1,1,2020-6-25,1,1,0
"I consider myself a very average user my last headset was a $30 Turtlebeach headset that was ruined by my toddler (that's for another time). These headphones have a higher sound and microphone quality compared to the Turtlbeach I had. All of my friends said my I sounded clearer online than before.I don' like how it has two connection ports:  the standard 3.5 mm aux connection for laptops and controllers and USB end used for power (LED lights). On a controller, there is no place to connect the USB so it's kind of useless to me. I have it just wrapped around itself. It makes the cable feel a little heavier.",4,1,2020-4-20,1,1,0
I had some mic problem with the previous one. The customer services did a great job. He/She send me a replacement quickly which works well.,4,1,2020-5-7,1,4,0
"I had a pair before and they broke within a month. Much to my dismay for Christmas I was gifted the same pair again (the gift giver not knowing how I had the headphones before) and decided to give them another try. The headset ended up breaking on its own. I know it broke on its own because I was extremely careful with the headphone (previous experience made me know how shoddy they were). Despite my efforts to keep the headset in the best conditions possible,  the mic stopped working within 12 days of purchase, and the sound continuously cut in and out for no reason making them impossible to use. They also don't work very well at noise cancelation. DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES FOR ANY REASON. these headphones are horrendous for gaming and I imagine horrendous for any other possible use.",1,1,2019-1-5,1,3,0
"Soon after getting these headphones, the headphones stretched out and no longer fit my head. I've had these heaphones for almost a year and I still can't bend the headphones back to their origin shape. Because of this, sound quality wasn't very good and it didn't cancel noise at all. At about 7 months in, the headphones started malfunctioning by randomly turning off or stop working. I would then have to quickly unplug and replug back in the headphones to get them to produce sound again. This got very annoying. I think its a good product for the price, but there are better headphones for the same price.Edit: The customer service is also terrible with this company. After writing this review, I was emailed by the company and was told that they would refund me if I took down my comment. After a lengthy conversation with a foreign individual, I took down the review to have the customer service never respond back to me. They have no care for their customers and I definetily not recommend this prodct, especailly for the price.",2,1,2020-8-23,1,1,0
"The Bengoo G9000 gaming headset is highly overrated. The headset has many problems which displeased me greatly. I did not get what I expected from the picture and the reviews that I had read before purchasing this item. One of the many problems this headset has is that it can only light up when you have plugged USB connector into a USB port, which gaming controllers do not have. The light cannot be turned off manually and will not turn on unless plugged into a USB port. The headset does not fit well at all either. The cushioning is very uncomfortable, rough, and squeezes the temples on the side of my head to the point where the pain will last for around an hour or two before the pain goes away. The headset can be easily adjusted but it still does not fit right. It will either sit on the top of my head but not fit comfortably around my ears or it will sit on the top of my ears, pulling down on them while the headband does not make contact with my head. Adjusting the headset does not fix this problem. Lastly, the headset has poor quality sound mechanics. Every sound appears to be deepened and or muffled in some way. For example, I was playing a game in which the player's success relies heavily on the player being able to hear the enemies footsteps and gunfire. While using the headset, I could not hear anything very well and could not tell the difference between the many sounds that I heard. So, overall this ""gaming"" headset is not that good at all for gaming, it does not fit comfortably, and it can cause pain to some users. I am very displeased with this headset and most definitely will not recommend this for anybody.  :(",1,1,2019-1-1,1,3,0
"I will preface this by saying I bought these for them boys in the house so I personally didn't try them out. My husband said the sound was bad but the boys 17 and 10 use them with no complaints. Which for the price seem like a good deal. Kids are going to be harder on things like this so I prefer to spend less money for them. I think if you are a serious gamer you would be better off spending more money, but if you are buying these for the kids in the house to have as a back up they are more than Adequate.On initial inspection they seem well made and appear that they will hold up well. I will update if that's not the case.",4,1,2019-12-22,1,1,0
"The speaker part of the mic itself would work, albeit with probably the worst sound quality I've heard out of any headphones.  The mic itself I could never get to work properly.  My computer would detect that I plugged something into the jack, but would never record or transmit anything.  I could hear myself speaking coming through the headphones, but that was the best I could ever get out of it.  That and the snowy sound and faintly hearing everything around me.  (directional mic my behind)Returning it.  Even at 20 its not worth it, practically unusable.",1,1,2019-6-21,1,3,0
"Overall, the Bengoo G9000 is a solid headset for its price. After buying the product, I had little to complain about. The noise cancellation is very good. I have a gaming laptop which sounds like a hurricane when you turn on the cooling boost, but whenever I play with my friends they didn't recognize it. The Microphone is amazing as well. I've previously owned multiple gaming headsets, and I can say that this microphone could keep up with most $60 - $70 headsets. The sound quality is just as good too, with a built-in set of buttons on the wire that is very convininet. Just for you guys wondering, the headset does require a USB port for the lights on the side of the headset. The only thing I'd say I partially disliked was the ""loose fit"" of the headset. If you have a smaller head like me, the headset can feel wobbly. Over time, however, the headset did start to feel more comfortable and I noticed it less. All in all, this product is great for its price and if you're looking for a headset with a good microphone and sound quality, this is the headset to buy.",5,1,2020-4-28,1,1,0
"The reason I'm reviewing these is because mine have finally worn out. But, i uncovered the fact that I bought them over 3 years ago. They are actually still working, but have lost the ability to playback certain frequencies, I guess. I recently got into sim racing and they simply can't play the sound of the engine, which turns out to be a problem. The other issue has always been the wound level. On Xbox at least, you just can't get them very loud. Its enough to get by, but not as loud and immersive as I'd like.But overall, they are an exceptional value. For this price tag, they do what they say and actually a lot more than I expected. I'd say if this is your price range, you will not be disappointed.",4,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"My son can’t stop raving about the quality of this headset! They fit comfortably on his ears and do an excellent job of blocking out noise both for him and anyone in the room with him. The cords are extra long and are covered with a thick braided fabric for protection. They are fully adjustable and will be able to grow with my son and be used for a long time, with both his ps4 and his laptop. His previous headset cost about the same amount but emit a beeping noise that we can’t get rid of and had flimsy cords that broke easily.",5,1,2020-3-31,1,1,0
I'm very upset. I bought this as a birthday gift for my son. They were working great the first day. He loved them and then all of a sudden they stopped working. I get on here and see I've missed my return date by 3 days as this was a birthday gift he just received and yesterday was the first day he could use them. It was a total waste of money and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. I can't tell what's wrong as he hasn't damaged them in anyway and he was playing with them just fine. At first i just thought the controller needed charged but after charging all night they still didnt work. I'm very upset with the whole process as I order from Amazon all the time. This may just change that because I'm not happy with how this was handled at all. Being a single mother I have to start shopping early as both of my kids birthday are 8 days apart so I ordered them back in February. This was his first real experience using headphones on his xbox and playing with his friends and now he can't do it again. Mad momma for sure!,1,1,2019-3-24,1,3,0
"This is a decent headset for the money. Has good sound quality. However, there's no talk back so you can't hear yourself talking. I ebbs up raising my voice often. You can't move the mic at all, it is rigid and stiff. It can only be used on the left side of your face. The Mic is hyper sensitive. There's no noise canceling at all. People can hear talking going on in the next room.  And forget about trying to break wind while playing. Everyone will hear the left cheek sneak. So mute the mic before you cut the cheese. It's kinda heavy and bulky.Decent price",4,1,2019-7-21,1,1,0
"I usually don't write negative reviews, but this time I was a little bit upset. Bought this headset six months ago for my son for use with his xbox.  The sound is good, the mic worked well, until it stopped working. The lights won't work unless you plug it into a usb source separately, and the xbox controller does not have a usb connection. Even for use with a computer or laptop, when you plug it into the mic slot, some people may not be able to plug it into the usb source, since the length of the usb connection is about 6 inches. For example if your mic connection is in front of your laptop, you won't be able to connect the usb for lights because it won't reach the port. (this wasn't really an issue for him, he just wanted to talk to his friends) But any way I tried to contact ""Bengoo Inc"" because the mic suddenly stopped working. They asked me for invoice number, and they won't help me out because technically they didn't sell it directly to me.  So i'm out nearly $30 and out of a headset already after only 6 months.",1,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
The USB is only for the light and this requires an audio jack to use the sound features. Sound quality is fine and they are relatively comfortable.Update: I originally wrote a one star review. After the seller contacted me I updated to a three star review. They have reached out multiple times offering a refund to delete the review even at three stars.,1,1,2020-2-21,1,2,0
"I've had this a week now and used it a few times. It's comfortable and the sound quality is good, and I've had no complaints from anyone I was talking to about my sound quality.I only have two cons, and other people have mentioned them, too: 1) the mic only moves one way, so it's going to be on your left. Not a big deal for me. 2) The LED lights are powered by the USB plug which splits off from the audio jack that goes into my PS4 controller. I will never have a nearby USB power source for these lights, so they might as well not be there.",4,1,2018-12-13,1,1,0
"I got the blue headset. The color is nice and it's an attractive looking headset. It works easily with an adapter for my iPhone so I can talk with my clients clearly and hands-free so I can complete documentation at the same time. I've received positive feedback from those I've spoken with while using the headset. I've also used it while playing computer games and it's worked nicely with my computer and iPad both. I haven't had a problem with the cord options getting in my way as it comes with a Velcro wrap and I keep the cord I'm not using wrapped and secured so it stays out of my way when I'm using the headset. If you're wanting a solid headset that gives you clear sound, this is a good option. I'm enjoying it! :)",5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"I purchased these to use for Skype calls and to block the noise in a sometimes busy office. The sound quality is good, but not great. Noise cancelling could be better but it is acceptable in most situation. If there is a conversation going on in the next cubicle I can still hear it between songs when listening to music. The microphone picks up well. I have a softer voice and people on calls have been able to hear me clearly when I use the microphone on this headset. If you are in a very noisy environment this headset may not be for you. It does what I needed but could be a little better so I give it 4 stars overall.- Update Oct 25, 2019  - I just finished a collaboration call on Skype, which I have been doing several times a day for the past 3 months. Sound quality is still good after a year of use.  I am considering purchasing another set to replace the more expensive set I use on my home gaming PC.",4,1,2019-3-21,1,1,0
"I'm not sure why anyone is complaining about these, they're pretty awesome for the price, I would even go as far to say that they're worth more than what I paid for. There's TONS of bass with these headphones by just having them plugged into my phone; I could feel the air moving on my ears with a heavy bass song.What I bought them for was Xbox gaming and chat features since my Xbox headset had died finally. They are very comfy, great volume control, and my friends said they can hear my perfectly through the mic. Just know that the LED lights won't work unless the USB cable is plugged in (So essentially won't work with an Xbox controller but will work on PC). I don't care about the LED, I thought lights on headphones are cheesy anyways so that wasn't really a priority for me.",5,1,2019-1-17,1,1,0
"I bought these for my son (10 y/o) for Christmas to go with his iPad and his Xbox.  I chose them somewhat randomly based on reviews and Amazon's recommendation and the fact that the description made it clear that they paired with the latest iPad as well as the Xbox.  I like that the headset includes plug adaptors for other systems that don't use a standard headset jack.  Unbeknowst to me, this was the exact same headset that my son had previously picked out for himself, so he was thrilled when he opened them because he already knew he liked them!  They are very comfortable, especially the padding on the part that goes over the top of the head.  He wore them on a plane trip even when they weren't attached to anything to block out some of the noise.  He said they were so comfortable, he could wear them all day.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,1,0
"I purchased for $35 and I am currently very impressed with what I got for this price. I like using my xbox for gaming, my PC for work and gaming, and my phone for video and voice chat. This headset works on all of these platforms quite seamlessly. They provide a depth and quality of sound that is higher than the price for which they sell. They are comfortable but not too hot on the ears or head. The microphone provides clear audio and has not caused reverb or feedback that I can notice or have been told. Cable is quite long and of high quality. Cable includes an in-line volume modulator as well as a mic mute switch. It ends in a divider that provides a 3.5mm auxillary jack and a usb. The lights on the sides of the headset only light up when using a usb as a power source. Included in the packaging is a splitter for the 3.5mm jack that allows for use in a microphone and speaker jack of a computer.Bottom Line: Do better headsets exist? Yes; Do better headsets exist within $50 of this price? Not that I have found.",4,1,2020-4-14,1,1,0

Lightweight, bright blue color with lights. The headset is comfortable, has a decent length cord, the mic can be turned off and on and there is volume control.  The cord is sturdy and it works on multiple platforms.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,1,1
"I got exactly what I ordered. And I mean that it does everything the item’s description said. It keeps other noises out, and the sound quality is great, especially considering how cheap it is. It’s lightweight and doesn’t become bothersome to wear after an extended period of time on. The mic is wonderful, I was happy to have my friend tell me that. I’ve had other headsets that ”auto tuned” me. The cord is durable feeling, so that’s a plus. If you’re wondering about connecting pieces, don’t. It comes with an 3.5 aux jack and 2.0 usb split at the end. You also get another connection piece that you plug the aux into that splits into mic and audio for PCs. You will not be disappointed in this if you get it.",5,1,2019-9-28,1,1,0
Working from home during the rona outbreak. The headset provided by my company suck. They are on ear and no noise canceling. After 10 hours my ears hurt and I done with repeating myself due to the noises in my office.Did my due diligence and purchased the blue set. The very day they arrived I was half way thru a 12 hour day. After swapping over to pro gaming headset my communication and comfort improved immensely. The noise canceling headphones and mic were noticed by everyone on my afternoon meeting.,5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
"Was so excited for my fiancé to open these on Christmas! He has been wanting a new pair for a while now so I thought this would be a perfect edition to his other gift.Sadly, they don’t work! The wiring is bad so not only can he not hear out of them but none of his buddies can hear him when they are playing games.",1,1,2019-1-8,1,3,0
"Received this headphone set and I have to say the quality of construction is better than anything I have seen before, and I have purchased a few different brands of headsets.  The cord is strengthened by a tight-weave cord, and the microphone arm is solid.  I like the comfort of the padding provided above the head--you don't know the headphones are resting on top of your head--and they are easily adjustable too.  My box contained a microphone adapter wire.  The lights make the headset look ""cool"" and the bass is very good.  Sound is good enough for games, movies and other videos, most musical interests, and for video-conferencing.  A pretty good deal for the price.",5,1,2020-4-3,1,1,0
"The product works extremely well. The cushioning on the inside of the earpieces are great for keeping your ears comfortable during long gaming sessions, while other similar products make the ears feel uncomfortable in as quickly as 45 minutes. Another positive point is the adjustable headband, which proves extremely useful to people with many different sized heads. Often, other headsets will only come in one, nonadjustable size, making it difficult to wear properly.  However, the adjustable headband makes sure that it is easy to wear no matter your head size.  While the LED lights do not add much functionality, they look great, even in the dark when I'm walking by my desk. If you are any kind of a streamer, they will most definitely look amazing on stream and help you get views. The product is a must-have for anyone looking to acquire another headset, and I would highly recommend it",5,1,2020-1-21,1,1,0
I'm a casual gamer so I don't really care for super expensive gaming equipment. I figured I would buy some cheap headphones and test my luck. It's been over a year now and these still work perfectly! My friends can hear me with no issues and the headphones themselves don't hurt your head when wearing them for an extended period of time.  I like that you can shut off the microphone with a simple switch and turn down the volume easily. They aren't 100% noise cancelling but VERY close. Would defiantly recommend to someone who is not trying to spend a lot on gaming accessories.,5,1,2019-10-31,1,1,0
"My head is too big for it. I’m sure I’m an anomaly but it fit really tight and pressed against my temple. Sound is good. Looks awesome and fun. Very lightweight which is nice. I currently have a Cloud X which is way heavier than this but it’s roomy for my big head.Update: BENGOO customer service reached out to me and offered a replacement or refund. I was really pleasantly surprised because I didn’t expect it at all. After all there’s really nothing wrong with their product. I just have a bigger head size then most people I think. I tried to convey in my review that the sound is great and it is a high quality for the price. I didn’t take the replacement or refund in good conscience because I don’t think it’s fair for them since their product is very good overall. My point is, BENGOO has exceptional customer service and if you don’t like the headphone they will replace or refund you without questions. This kind of quality customer service is VERY RARE in the industry and I applaud them for it.",3,1,2018-12-29,1,1,0
"This headset is a great investment for anybody who enjoys gaming online, with friends, or just enjoying a solo experience. It is made with fantastic quality and feels robust without being too heavy to put on your head. It has plenty of cord that allows you to walk around a little while the headset is plugged in. One adjustment I would recommend would be to separate the two ways to plug in the headset so that only one is at the end of the cord at a time. Currently, the cord splits off into a USB cable and an audio jack rather than one or the other. It would only take making two separate attachments to the end to allow you to use one or the other, depending on what your system requires. Because that is the only thing I would say about it, however, I would definitely recommend this headset to anybody looking for a new or better headset.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,1,0
"EDIT:I thought I would try them again, and ordered a second pair after returning the first. I Was surprised how quickly it came and it came in great shape. Works perfectly and really drowns out the outside noise. Great speakers in the headphones, and All around great build. The company reached out to me after returning the first one, and asked me to reconsider, which made me purchase a second pair to try. I applaud the company for putting a lot of effort into their work and dedication to good products.",4,1,2017-9-8,1,1,0
"Just started playing more games, finally and I was in need of a decent pair of headphones. I didn't feel like spending a ridiculous amount, so I got these headphones. For the price, these headphones rock! They worked immediately. Only issue I would say would be nice to ""upgrade"" would be a more mobile microphone. The mic only moves up and down, making it sometimes harder for the other person to hear when there is a lot of action going on. If I could move it closer to my mouth, it would eliminate vocal issue. I personally don't use the LED feature, so I wish i could just remove it entirely... Maybe I can just snip a few wires..But ultimately, awesome headphones!",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,1

Do not buy.UPDATED TO ADD: This seller is now sending me multiple emails offering a refund to take down my review.  You should know what you're getting, so I am not taking the refund or taking down my review.  We are using the headphones in our computer for online learning, instead of it's intended use with XBOX One.  It works fine, but for a computer headset I would've spent way less.

"My years old Hyper X cloud headphones gave out so I thought I would try these as a replacement, they aren't quite as good as the Hyper X but that is to be expected, my biggest qualm with these is that the lights require USB power and as such at the end of the cable is a split to a 3.5 mm jack and a USB plug. which is kind of hmm, makes the lights a useless feature on a PS4 controller, I kind of wish there was another 3.5 mm jack at the base of the volume/mute controller, like with the Hyper X that way I could plug the base controller into my PC and switch between PC and PS4 usage easily. alas, for the money they are good solid headphones of which I am pleased to be using over busted ones.",4,1,2020-9-28,1,0,0

Not only for the style, the noise cancellation and the quality of sound but also for when I opened the box to examine my purchase, out came the axillary cables needed for this headset to work properly.

It works great on the PS4, but when connected to Xbox I can hear the in-game audio and other players can hear me, but I can't hear them. I've looked for every setting I can find with no luck; not super useful for team games.Side note: the lights don't work unless the USB is connected for power; which is dumb since you'd have to be sitting about 6"" from the console itself. I didn't buy these for the light feature so I don't actually care about this but others might.",3,1,2019-2-17,1,2,0
"This is a great headset for those who want something a little more substantial than the regular starter gamer sets, but don't want to drop big money for a top of the line. I tested it out while playing Spider Man on the PS4, and it sounded fantastic. While you're playing it pretty much cancels out the noise around you enough that you kinda forget where you are. They're pretty lightweight so it won't put pressure on your neck. The lights are really cool, but they only light up when you're on a laptop/PC where you can plug in the USB to power them. That was something just a little bit disappointing for me, but you can't even see the lights while you're playing, so not a big deal. When I was using the mic, it didn't sound CRYSTAL clear, but it wasn't at all bad either. I'm not sure if it picks up background noise, I haven't tried that out yet. I'll probably update this review once I do. But overall, I would totally recommend this to someone who doesn't have the money to invest in something way over the top. This one would function just fine!",5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"I'm genuinely impressed by how good these are. I've never played a FPS (first person shooter) game before and I didn't realise how helpful it would be to have surround sound (to be able to listen for footsteps, etc). However, I still only game casually and didn't want to spend a ridiculous amount of money on a headset. This is an extremely comfortable headset that's well-made for how cheap it is. Yes, it's all plastic, but I have no issues with sound clarity in the headphones or speech quality in the mic.The only thing I really wish was different is the volume control. It's a little dial on the cord, and it doesn't really lock or click into place, so sometimes if I'm shifting position while gaming, it'll turn the dial and therefore the volume. That being said, it really is just a small issue that I barely notice and the headset otherwise has been game-changing for how well I play.",5,1,2017-10-30,1,2,0
Admittedly I didn’t know what to expect when I bought this headset. I’m playing D&D online and knew needed a mic and headset to work well with my tower and I found this.The ear pieces are super comfy; the head strap is comfortable on my head and the cord is nice and long so I don’t feel stuck. If I could change one thing it would be that the mic could move easily. Because it can’t roll backwards the make is on your left ear and I prefer mics on my right but for the comfort and good qualify of the headphones it’s an easy adjustment.,5,1,2020-2-2,1,1,0
"This is an upgrade to my regular headphones and includes a microphone.  I was looking for a headphone with included microphone that allows me to do video conferencing and the occasional online gaming.  A gamer recommended this as a good starter one for a decent price.  The description sounded good.  Since this has more features than my regular headphones, I was a little confused with how to use it when I first took it out of the box.  The directions are sparse, and the illustration was not clear.  I didn't see any kind of tech support contact, except the email to return a product.  The headset has an attached USB cable and audio cable, plus an extra set of audio cables.  On my laptop, I could only plug in the USB cable or the audio cable but not both at the same time.  It was only because of previous reviewers that I learned that the USB cable is for a cosmetic effect (making the headphones light up) and not necessary.  I had mixed results when I first plugged into my laptop, then my desktop. I could not hear or speak when I first plugged it into the audio jack (from what I could make of the directions, it seems like this would require the additional cables to plug into the back of the desktop). I fiddled with the settings, it seems to be working now from the audio jack (glad I didn't have to get to the back of the computer).  I tried this with Teams, Roll20, and Zoom, and they seem to work ok with the headphone and microphone. Very pleased with the fast shipping--I was expecting this to arrive in 2 weeks, and it came within days, even with regular shipping.",4,1,2020-4-19,1,1,0
"My son has gone through many headsets and this is has worked great. Update: the headset started having some issues with the sound just shy of a year from the date we first purchased it. We contacted the seller and they immediately messaged us back with some tips and fixes, but the headset was still having issues so they shipped a replacement within 2 weeks. That is some great customer service and I would definitely buy from them again. The new headset is perfect and we were able to extend the warranty for 3 years at no cost.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,1,0
"It is great for its price point.. that’s it though don’t expect to be blown away. But I did get more than I expected. It is kinda cheap quality but I’ve never had a gaming headset before so I wanted one to try out to see if I’d even like them. Sound quality is great, however it doesn’t get very loud even at full volume. But the microphone is great and everyone can hear me very clearly. Sensitivity on mic is set at lowest setting on my PS4 and it’s just right.  I am completely satisfied with it and like I said I got it to see if I’d like them first before spending a lot on a better headset. However I can see myself using this till the day it stops working before buying another.  I wish you could order it without USB wiring in it cause all it’s good for is lighting and it’s just extra wires dangling from my PS4 controller.",5,1,2019-9-1,1,1,0
Worked right out of the box. Hardest part was setting up his PS4 to use the headset.My son loved it right away and of course jumped right into Fortnite with it. He says it’s so much better than trying to use a set of earbuds.,4,1,2020-2-11,1,1,0
"I purchased this product for my 8yo son to use at home for his school distance learning due to our stay at home order for COVID19. I’m working from home so was getting too noisy with all the kids on their devices. The sound on the microphone comes through very crisp and the noise cancellation seems to work almost too well as my son doesn’t seem to hear me calling him when they’re on lol. Lastly, he loves the look of these and I have to admit they’re pretty cool looking too!",5,1,2020-4-17,1,1,0
"Umm...honestly disappointed. The LEDs only work if you plug it into your console, otherwise it won't light up. Sound quality decent, cheap plastic. Definitely a starter headset, a good bang for your buck(not). The fact it says ""Gaming headset"" on it makes me wanna chuck it into a sea of unepic gamers. At least you can tell them to ""git gud"" without getting roasted for a cheap ass headset.These positive reviews above or below mine are probably not real gamers or parents that definitely went the cheap route, only for it to break weeks later. And whaddya know, it's from China...whoop dee doo. Also, these guys will email you to take down your honest reviews, only to bribe you with a fake ass gift card.",3,1,2020-2-12,1,1,0
"My mother bought my son a set of Bengoo headsets for Christmas and the mic screw that held the mic onto the headphones (inside the unit, so not able to be seen and tightened to prevent it from detaching) fell inside the unit.  This left the mic dangling and the wires exposed.  Of course, it wasn't long before the headset completely stopped working.  Meanwhile, I tried multiple times to contact the manufacturer to have it replaced under warranty, but they never replied.  Luckily for us, my mom also purchased the extended warranty and after haggling with them a couple of times, they finally paid for it.  I purchased the new set in September 2018 along with the extended warranty (giving them the benefit of a doubt that it was a fluke) and only 3 months later, we can only hear out of one side of the headset.  We will not be buying from Bengoo again.",1,1,2018-12-26,1,3,0
"I've been an Audiophile for a while, since I was brought into sound production at an early age. I admit that normally when I buy headphones of any kind, they tend to cost upwards of $300. When my last pair of Sennheiser's died I decided to try something that wouldn't break my bank during this time. After A LOT of research, I stumbled upon the Bengoo G9000 since I was looking for something that would suit both gaming and everyday use for me (which mostly includes sound editing and music with a little surround sound for movies for fun). Upon arrival, I was a little worried. The headset felt a little lite compared to what I was used to. Usually I would think that the product was made of cheap materials, meaning the sound quality would not be worth my time, but instead I found it was sturdy and gave great sound quality. The lighter materials allowed for better comfort during extended use, and with the padding over the ear instead of on them, it made for a more comforting fit. Although light, the materials were durable and strong. The 6ft cable with mic on/off and volume control allowed for easy use for every situation. With the long cable I didn't need to worry about switching the headset between devices and with the volume control I could easily adjust the volume in quick situations when I didn't want to set a volume through the device. The sound quality is great, especially for the price (normally I would expect to pay at least $180 for this quality). The added ability to turn off the LED while still using the headset is great since I use it late at night as well. I would definitely suggest this for anyone's next headset, whether for gaming, sound editing, or just for everyday use. This is the second Bengoo product I've purchased recently and I have already become a fan.",5,1,2020-5-15,1,1,0
The headphone cord has both a USB plug and a headset jack.The USB plug was confusing. It looked like the headset could connect either through the headphone jack or USB.,1,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"The sound isn't too bad. There's a bit of a muddied/clarity/lower quality tinge to it, but it's not bad. Maybe many won't notice it. Sounded even worse at first, had to play around with Audio levels (on PC) to make it sound better, but it did help.On my Ps4, it sounded quite good, actually. So seems to be no worry of the bad audio levels with that.",4,1,2020-9-4,1,0,1
"It surrounds my whole ear without crushing part of it, quite comfortable to wear for over an hour. The sounds from the game are so clear I mute my TV while I'm gaming. Only real 2 issues is the usb cord is heavy and dangles, and when I'm in a live gaming party others say the background noise of their game is drowned out when I'm talking. As a personal sound system though its certainly worth the money. Plus they offer you additional stuff! It would be nice if the microphone could be reversed in a 180* to be on either side like the original headsets.",4,1,2020-4-9,1,1,0
Bought this December for my son to use for his XBox gaming. He seems happy with it.Broke in less than 3 months. The cord is frayed/bent/exposed by the 3.5mm connector.,3,1,2020-3-9,1,1,0
"the cool looks of headphones are actually easy and cheap to do. looks are standard.lets talk quality, the bass is good, but theres so much bass and no treble, I'm a musician and the treble notes are all so quiet that youll miss a lot because of the roaring bass, I like a good 50/50 atleast but this is all bass and quiet treble.",3,1,2019-6-11,1,1,0
"They’re not really advertised as noise cancelling so don’t “expect” them to be, but personally they block out 90% of all noise in my house just by having them on my head let alone when theyre actually producing noise. I think I’m supposed to plug them into something with the USB to get the LED’s to work which I don’t even care about so I haven’t bothered. The mic is very clear and built well and all around perfect for the price! I would buy this again and have recommended it to a few friends already, also the cord is super long which is great!",5,1,2020-1-11,1,1,0
"This Product, the Bengoo G9000 Headset is falsely advertised as ""Over Ear"", which feels not as a mistake but a blatant lie.  Im a 35 year old male with normal sized ears, these would not even cover half of my ear.  I could not even imagine my ""teenage"" self having ears small enough for this headset, I could only possibly imagine them fitting someone under the age of 14.After several months the company reached out to me to offer me a refund.  When I had purchased this they did not have a return policy.  It seems that may have changed.  Be sure to check yourself if you plan to purchase this item.",2,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"Okay First thing, they do not rest well on my ears, it feels like they quit thinking about the human ear while making these, they might fit over your ear if you have small ones.Second they don't cancel any noise, infact on the right side if feels like its not even bent right to make sure it encloses the ear so i just hear way to much background noise on one side, and that's been driving me crazy for the past week.",1,1,2020-5-6,1,2,0
"I purchased these headphones primarily to use while gaming. I wasn't looking to spend a lot of money so I wanted something that had decent sound at a reasonable price. I've been very impressed with these headphones. Sound quality is excellent given the price point with no distortions even at higher volumes. The microphone picks up audio very well and others have noted my voice comes through very clearly. The headphones are very comfortable to wear even after extended use and the foam padding hasn't shown any signs of wear. A bonus is the included audio adapter in case you don't have a combined headphone/microphone jack on your computer. Very thoughtful to include this adapter. Overall, an excellent choice for headphones and I highly recommend.",5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"The only complaint I could possibly have is that the ear padding doesn't quite fit my ears just right, but even then it's not an issue. The sound quality for music, gaming, voice chats, you name it is all above and beyond. The mic works well and the sound differential between the game and the chat are perfect, they don't really need any adjusting at all! Considering the price, I was a bit hesitant because they seemed like a steal or ""Too good to be true"", but they honestly are. I was pleasantly surprised by how good these headphones are. Definitely a recommended purchase!",5,1,2020-3-23,1,1,0
"My last headset, Turtle Beach X32’s is what I’ll be comparing this headset to. I had the X32’s for almost a decade and still function fine, I just wanted a new headset.The X32 requires two AAA batteries. Thankfully I had rechargeable batteries to swap out but still a pain when my headset dies in the middle of an online match. The G9000 is powered by the cord plugged into the controller, therefore, no more dying headset in the middle of pwning noobs.",5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,1
I understand it’s an inexpensive headset. I was just looking for something to determine what features I was looking for. I played for an average of 3-4 hours a day. The headset jack for the xboxone started having issues almost immediately. The wiring is very flimsy.There has also been some compatibility issues where all of a sudden I’ll have no sound. Playing with the configuration eventually gets the sound back.,1,1,2019-2-7,1,3,0
"I just received these today so I can’t speak on how they will hold up but I will update this review after some time. I am used to using many headsets and have used some high end gaming headsets in the past as well as I have owned some high end headphones ear buds etc. these are an absolutely solid choice. They feel solid, not too heavy but not too light either. For me they fit very well and my girlfriend now says she can’t hear any noise coming from outside the headphones when I game with them on. The cushions are about as thick as my thumb (see image) and they weren’t cool but my ears also weren’t hot either and they stayed comfortable for more then a few hours of gaming already. So far these are a great buy for the money. The audio is solid, they can’t compete in my opinion with a high end Astro, Rig, Lucidaudio, etc but for the money you will save, and from what I can tell these will last a long time, this would be perfect for someone who may be just starting to wade into the gaming waters and wants a solid headset at a low price before investing more money. For me I was looking for a backup headset, these would be perfect for a teen who may not be responsible and break them, etc.I gave 4 stars for noise cancellation as when I was listening to music / game audio I couldn’t hear a tv right next to me but to be clear they don’t have a “noise cancellation” button or feature like other headphones have. If you have audio coming in you won’t hear what’s around you. If you just put the headphones on to block noise, these aren’t the choice for you as they will barely muffle outside noise",5,1,2020-5-12,1,1,1
I wanted to love these headphones but after one week the left side of the headphones stopped working. I contacted Amazon support because this item was not eligible for a refund. The Amazon tech support team informed me that that receive complaints about this item very often and because of that they were able to issue me a full refund. I would say purchase at your own risk.  It seems this item has a 50/50 percent chance of malfunctioning.  My son did love the item for the few days he was able to use it and he was very disappointed when they malfunctioned.,1,1,2019-3-14,1,3,0
"This was really easy to use and it's very nice and fits comfortably even with glasses on. Pretty lengthy cord to attach to any device BUT there is one downside, unless you're using a PC the LED light will not come on. At the very end of that long cord it splits, one connection for the mic and the other for the USB port for the LED lights. Therefore for all other gaming units it's basically just the functionality of the headphones w/o lights. I don't know about you guys but the LED lights got my attention before anything else. I can probably get another another connection for the usb to work but I prefer wireless items and made an exception for these.....FOR THE LIGHTS...lol!  Overall, they are very nice, durable, light yet not so light it feels cheap. I have the red and blue.",4,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0

"My 10 year old son got his first xbox for xmas and after searching for a headset (having NO IDEA what brand/type was better) he made it easy and looked at the few I had in my cart and chose these based on nothing. We bought them in early Jan 2019 (so almost 3 months ago) and they have held up so far. (Kids aren't exactly gentle with stuff and they have traveled between homes several times).  I will say he's very picky about headphones/buds.  We have a DVD player in our van with cordless headsets and he's constantly complaining that they make his ears 'hot' and complains a lot about other regular-use headphones (over ear like these) at home & school because they are too tight. Always too tight or hot.  He's a normal sized kid (without a giant head) so I usually just roll my eyes.....(millennials).  He likes this set a lot.  He seems to change the batteries often (I'm not sure how often though since fresh batteries are readily available in our kitchen drawer) but I wouldn't say that means they don't have a good battery life....(I always use Energizer or Duracell but rechargeable ones wouldn't be a bad idea). I just think it's due to him using them every time he plays xbox and I don't have any other battery operated headphones/sets to compare with...only my bluetooth iphone headsets. He has said he loves the headset without a single complaint about hot ears or tight fit.  I'm just about to order a second identical set to keep at his dad's house (one less thing to lug back & forth) so I thought I'd add a review (which I rarely do).  There are 4 colors and the only thing negative I can think of to say is while he loves blue I thought I'd order red for variety and for telling them apart in case both end up in one house but the other colors are all double the price of the blue.  Not any thing negative against the function or quality of the product but I never understood why identical items can have such a price difference.  No biggie, I'll just mark the blue ones with a marker if I decide I want to be able to tell them apart.  At the time of this (March 2019) the blue are ~$22 and the red (and other colors) are ~$40.We'd definitely recommend them.",4,1,2019-3-24,1,1,0
"They look good in the pictures, but the actual quality of it was not good at all. The microphone was not working, for me on PS4. Not sure if mine was defective, but still the quality of the whole product was not worth the price to me.",1,1,2018-8-5,1,6,0
"I have never hated a headset more than I hate this one. It echos whenever you're in a voice chat, so people you're talking to hear themselves echo through your mic, EVEN IF YOU'RE MUTED. It constantly stopped transmitting sound when plugged in, causing me to have to unplug it and plug it back in many, many times before it decided to transmit sound again. Worst of all? Apparently, I'm not even allowed to return it, just ""talk to an expert"" to ""ask how-to questions"" as if I'm incompetent. I can't rate this lower than I have, but it's a 0/5 for me. I'm never buying this brand ever again.",1,1,2019-2-21,1,3,0
"I agree with the reviews I read about this headset before buying it that it's a great headset for folks who are beginner to intermediate gamers. The sound is pretty decent, both in the ears and from the microphone (my husband called me using it hooked it up to his phone, and there was no difference between the microphone here and the one on his phone), though at a low volume I can still hear the noises in my house so I wouldn't say it's super-effective at noise cancellation unless you crank the volume up. I wish I could raise the volume in the headphones a little louder, but it's not a dealbreaker, since I can raise the volume on my computer and it's just as well. All in, not a bad headset - especially since I got it on sale.",4,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0

"My son has been using this headset for the past 6 weeks for virtual school.  After breaking a cheaper pair in 2 weeks, I spent a little more for a quality headset that hopefully would last longer.  I haven't been disappointed.  So far there are no problems.  The sound quality is excellent and the noise cancellation is plenty.  He really likes the light up feature but doesn't always plug it in to save system battery.  Of note, there are 2 connections for the headset.  The sound attaches through a jack and the lights are powered by a USB.  He has not tried it with a gaming system, but has use it on his chromebook and tablet.",5,1,2020-10-5,1,0,0
"This headset has a nice design and incorporates LED lights to enhance the visual appeal. The overall feel of the headset is pretty substantial, and it appears to be made of decent quality components. The exterior is hard plastic while the pads around the ears and at the top of the head have a soft vinyl feel. Sound quality for games is very good, and the headset does a pretty good job of blocking out ambient noises. I haven't experienced any issues with the microphone or headset, and I would recommend this headset for somebody looking for an inexpensive and good quality gaming set. This is a very good headset for younger gamers because of the visual appeal.",5,1,2020-5-10,1,1,0
"I'm new to Amazon and was hesitant to buy headphones for gaming with my PC due to the low price.  I have another brand that cost twice as much and like they say, so I thought, ""You pay for what you get.""  In this case that quote is not true.  I am planning to buy a laptop computer for my son to game on (his first one) and was looking for some headphones that looked to be good quality and good looking.  When I saw what the BENGOO G9000 looked like and the systems it works on, I thought,what the heck!  When it came in (two days) I took it to my office and tried it out.  Let me tell you, I don't write reviews very often but I was so impressed with these headphones that I had to write a review.  These headphones are great to look at, surprising good quality and came with an adapter for two into one jacks.  This product was so good that I bought two.  The way I look at it is, If I can get two for the price of one, why not?  Enjoy!",5,1,2020-3-15,1,1,0
"My son needed a replacement headset as his former one stopped working - he has only been using this a week but so far so good.  He said he can hear well and others can hear him well.

Inside the package is an insert thanking me for my order, asking me to leave a review, and in return I will receive a free item of my choice.  I emailed the company as the instructions said to do on June 27, 2020 and as of today I have received no response and no free item.

"We got this on a lightning deal and saved it for a gift for Easter. Our 9 yr old son was extremely excited since we said he was too young for one w/ the Xbox.  So far it works great with the iPad or phone, but it has been extremely frustrating to figure out how to hook it up to our Xbox One.  We finally got it, but it would be SUPER nice if a insert on how to connect with different gaming systems.  Overall, as a starter headset I would recommend it.",4,1,2020-4-24,1,1,0

"I game a lot online and headphones and sound quality are really important to me, so when my last ones broke I was a bit distraught.

Certainly better than my last $50+ headset.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,1,0
Pros:- These fit my husband’s head really well and he said they are really comfortable.,4,1,2020-1-4,1,1,1
I have had these for almost 2 years. I use them exclusively to play my PS4 Pro online. They sound decent and the mic quality is fine. I never have a problem hearing my friends or them hearing me. For reference I also use air pods pro and Sony xb900n headphones. These don’t sound as good but they are pretty cheap. So they’ve lasted me 2 years and sound decent. I say they don’t suck and I’m happy with my purchase. I could deal without the silly lights and long cord but that’s easily dealt with using a cable tie.,3,1,2020-5-13,1,1,0

"My husband just recently got this headset and seems to really like the noise cancellation and sound quality. It looks great too. He did have a few complaints though. The chord was excessively long, which is annoying for him. Also, he said it’s hard to tell at times when he is muted since there isn’t a feature that displays when connecting to the controller. He said it’s a little more of a pain to use the button on the actual chord itself. But other than that, he seems happy with it for the price.",4,1,2020-5-14,1,1,0
I bought this headset for my seven year old who is attending school online this year due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. He needed a good headset that allowed him to not only hear his class but to also join in on discussions. The mic and the speakers inside are crystal clear. The cord on the headset is very long too which makes it great because my son sometimes forgets he's wearing them and walks away from the computer. The extra length has stopped him from pulling the computer off on the floor when plugged in. I'm going to try and use them for a podcast I record too because they have been so great.,5,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0
"For whatever reason, I don't know if it's my ears or what, but sometimes these headphones in terms of comfort are fine and won't be annoying. However, more often than not, these tend to get really annoying and hurting my ears after a few hours. (This is why it gets a 3 star review). The sound quality is fine, I'm not sure if it's surround sound, but it's fine for most gaming. Just bear in mind these get sometimes awfully uncomfortable.And as for noise cancellation, I can't really tell if it does much other than being regular headphones with passive noise cancellation. My hunt for the ideal, or at least a really good PS4 headset/headphones continues.",3,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
Actually a decent product.  I got it for the looks.  Sounds good amazing.  Won't damage your ears. wether that's a good or bad thing to you I'll let you decide.  Bot completely noise cancelling but works great.  I'll be honest I got it cause it was purple lights. Been testing them out for a week now. I like them. Hopefully when they come out with a better version they enhance the sound quality and more LEDs.  Not bad for the price.  Works great,5,1,2020-5-24,1,1,0
"The headset looks exactly like the image! It's sleek, and comfortable (so far) and the sound quality is great. I wouldn't consider it nosie cancelling, I still hear some outside noise but it does a pretty good job. The directions are kind of difficult, the English portion seems smaller than other sections. I have yet to figure out how to turn on the blue, but it's not a big deal. I'm overall super content. Packaging was super nice, and it works well! Huzzah.",4,1,2020-4-17,1,1,0
"**edit The vendor reached out to me and offered to replace the original pair that I purchased, I accepted their generous offer and received them within days.

My son really liked them so for the price I just bought the same ones to replace the other headset.",5,1,2019-1-2,1,1,0

"I bought this for my PS4 and it worked really well for the past 2 years. The sound quality is great, noise cancellation is good but not completely silent, and the feel of the ear cushions are comfy for awhile.My only con about this product is that it has a USB connection cable that I rarely ever used for the PS4. It makes sense if you were to use it for a PC but when you use it for any console, it just adds more weight to the cable that plugs into the actual controller. Over time that weight of the USB cable pulls and pulls on the other cable and eventually renders the entire item useless. The audio started to cut in and out and now I can only hear out of the left ear piece.",4,1,2020-5-21,1,1,1
"I have been using the default headset that came with my PS4. I finally treated myself, and boy does this headset come through.

The thing I am most excited about is the versatility of it I can use it on my Laptop, Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox 1, and the headset has a cool blue glow when the USB is plugged in.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,1,0
"I am updating a poor review I gave. The headset was faulty (with electronics it happens- we may have got a bad set, or maybe something happened during shipping), but I was contacted by the company and they were very kind in offering solutions. That is what I appreciate, great customer service & that is what I got. My son loved this set of headphones, so I’m grateful that he will be able to use his BenGoo G9000 Gaming headset again. Thanks to JoJo for his time in helping to rectify the situation. Much appreciated.",5,1,2019-7-23,1,1,0
Original one broke within two weeks but the company reached out to me and sent me a replacement one for free. We just tried out the new one and it does not work. I reached out to the company and I am waiting on a response and hoping that I will be offered a complete refund. The only good thing that I can say is that they were very a very friendly company to deal with but I am very disappointed with the product.,1,1,2019-9-22,1,2,0
was in dire need of an affordable headset spent an hour or so looking for something this caught my eye primarly because of the leds yeah im a bit of a led nerd so i have had these for a year or so and they are still going strong lights and all still work the cable is unfortunatly long however i will state it is also a decently sturdy one so if these break or stop working i will buy again,5,1,2020-4-30,1,1,0

"This was a purchase for my child for gaming. While we just received the product today, it generally seems to be decent so far. My complaint is what I consider to be a product misrepresentation in the led light feature. It turns out that this feature is only functional when the USB is engaged, i.e.  computer gaming, vs a gaming system like xbox or playstation ( what we have). Otherwise, the cord is too short to connect to the system, plus the cord that connects to the controller, and its too many cords everwhere. As the light was a selling point for us, I found it annoying and misleading. Will still keep the headset since we already have them, but hoping to save someone else the same mistake.",4,1,2020-5-18,1,1,0
"I really like the sound on these. They are awesome. One thing to be aware of as a PS4 user, is that it's kind of hard to play and have them lit up. The cord where it splits is a little short. But I'm not concerned with that. I just want the sound. I get good bass and can hear great on apex legends and other shooting games. Really enjoy these. I like how you can mute the mic. And volume control is awesome. I love these! Also are adjustable which I didn't notice because I didn't need to adjust. Very happy with my purchase.",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,1
"I've been putting off buying a new headset since my old one broke last year, because I didn't want to spend a bunch of money just to get decent sound quality. I decided to take a chance with a lesser known brand (at least in the US), and I'm glad I did! Turns out you don't need to spend $80 on Turtle Beach or whatever. I tested these with music, games, and videos, and everything sounds great, (especially the bass in the music).The only drawback I noticed is that the mic is very quiet, probably to minimize background noise. But as long as you turn up mic sensitivity on whatever console or PC you're using, it should be fine. I won't be using the mic anyway, since I'll mostly be using these when I'm livestreaming and I already have a condenser mic.",5,1,2019-12-25,1,1,0
"I was a bit skeptical about buying this pair of headphones, just like I am whenever I pick any pair of headphones, simply because it seemed too good to be true.The outcome was very positive. I got a good pair of headphones for the price I paid and they're very reliable and study on my head. The pads are a bit stiff but they work flawlessly, aiding that noise cancellation and comfort get boosted even further.",5,1,2020-9-28,1,0,0
"These headphones are absolutely worth the buy. I had recently encountered an unfortunate string of headphones breaking soon after purchase. I didn't want to keep wasting my money, but at the same time I was getting desperate.  I was willing to give cheap headphones a try, and was blown away at how good this set was for the price. The head strap fits comfortably over the head, and the earpieces fit nicely over the ears. The mic has a wide pickup range, and returns high quality voice audio. The audio displayed by the earpieces is amazing, and the surround sound quality is breathtaking. The cord is plenty long enough, and the LED's on the headphones look amazing. 10/10, absolutely worth the purchase.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"I think it's pretty good. I bought December 21st in 2017, and it has been fine until a day or so ago. I can still hear fine for the time being, but the mic went out. I've been using with a PS4.I think my only complaint is that the sound can crackle and mess up if, where you plug into the controller, it twists and turns. Which it is bound to do when you play with the controller on your lap.",4,1,2020-4-19,1,1,0
"These are surprisingly good headset for XBOX COD modern warfare. So the sound quality is good HOWEVER it doesn’t have much bass. I must say that you can hear “Footsteps” more clear than any other cheap headset. It’s surprisingly good and can hear your enemy much better compared to regular TV volume. Has sweet LED lights BUT requires a USB drive to “light up”. Extremely comfortable, adjustable, and cool looking. I’m happy...",5,1,2020-5-10,1,1,0
"While sound is good and microphone is adequate (fine for gaming or casual chatting, not good for recording), the design of the bad and headphones makes it so they sit at an uncomfortable angle on the users ears. I actually turned the headset around (so that the microphone was directed at the back of my head) at which point the headset rested comfortably and flush against my ears. And no, this is not a problem with my ears. I've used dozens of headsets in the past and never encountered this problem.In addition to this, the  headset band squeezes the head a little too tightly, causing a headache over time.",2,1,2020-4-1,1,1,0
"The headset is comfortable to wear and can adjust. The ear muffs are soft and cancel out background noise good enough that I cannot hear myself talk. The sound is clear and loud enough the bass is also pretty good on it. The cord is long enough about 6' long and the volume control is also on the cord. I did not like that you can only use the headset with the mic on the left side, it does not allow you to change to the right side. The lights on the side of the headset are a cool feature it would be better if they change color. Good gaming headset for the price paid. Sound is good and clear. If I would change anything on the headset I would make them wireless and would also make it able to change which side you can have the mic on but it's a good headset for the price.",4,1,2019-12-9,1,2,0

"Update: We've had these a year. We have come to realize that the headset is not defective but there is an issue with Xbox 1 remotes and the mic jack. We've returned multiple Xbox remotes for mic jack issues but the headset is still going strong. The headset is still working great from day of purchase. A little info on the headset.... You cannot hear your own voice in the headset, that causes the person to talk louder to hear themselves. The mic picks up lots of background noise. They are comfortable to wear. I would say they are a good product for the price for kids gaming. We've used them on both an Xbox one and ps4.",4,1,2019-2-19,1,1,0
"Note: I am writing this with my 12-year-old gamer.If I could rate it a 6/5 for sound quality, I would. It doesn't work well with certain controllers (non-xbox brand, specifically) - you lose bass in the headset with those types for whatever reason. With xbox brand controllers, the sound quality is amazing. We've tried several different brands of headsets, including Turtle Beach, and this seems to work the best. This headset fits perfectly and it's comfortable to wear for hours. We just purchased the second one of these and he was thrilled to have this one again!",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"The headphone is nice and seems to be sturdy.  Only negative on this headphone is the USB that is to ""light"" the headphones is a separate cord to the actual headphone jack so when my daughter used it on our HP computer the USB port is opposite the headphone jack and she couldn't use the ""light"" option for her headphones. Would have been nice once the headphone jack is plugged in that the lights work at same time. Other than this the clarity of the mic is good. So far no complaints on the sound quality and it does what it does.  Same for the PS4, the light option cannot be used if you plugged it into the remote control.",4,1,2019-3-14,1,1,0
"I am a preteen.  My family has purchased MANY headsets in the past, and generally within a few months, we beat them to death.  What was apparent when the Bengoo G9000 gaming headset was unpacked was the higher build quality, better padding & fit and a nice thick cable.  The volume control is easily accessible, the sound quality seems superior and it just feels more rugged.  The only downside is that the mic extension is not flexible, so it makes it harder to move the mic closer to my mouth.  Overall, a very impressive and quality headset for the price.  Thank you, Bengoo!",5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"i use these on my xbox one controller for chat communication, and listening to in game sounds. it kind of sounds directional, but not entirely. the microphone is for the birds. the mic picks up sounds from the ear pieces if too loud. when too low, you cant hear anything (people talking, or in game sounds). also using my jack to tether from my computer doesnt work either.bottom line, they are okay if you want to hear gaming noises up close. not well for chat.",3,1,2019-12-1,1,1,0
"With the adventure of online school we really needed to buy our daughter some quality electronics and accessories to deal with the new way of life. These headphones are not only a great price, they are a seriously quality made product. Very light so she isn't going to get headaches from the hours wearing them, and easily fit her big head, (sorry, love). They have easy to use controls she can use by feel. It's a plug and play item so no batteries to worry about. The microphone is a must for zoom classes and frankly I would buy it again and at twice the price.",5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,1
"This headset is amazing.Sound quality is great, comfortable and the mic works great! What more do you want?! I tried the big name brand hyped out nonsense and bought this as a backup. Guess what? Big name broke and this has come in clutch for 2 years.",5,1,2020-5-3,1,1,0
"I bought these headphones for my son for his 9th birthday and he has been more than happy with them. He loves the sound, the way they block out external noise, the in-line volume and microphone control, and the way they light up! Due to COVID-19 the poor guy is stuck at home spending way more time than normal on his computer playing video games, chatting with his buddies and attending school.  Anyone spending that much time on the computer needs the right equipment and this set more than meets his needs at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended!",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,1
"BLUF:  Solid gaming headset and one of the best headsets for gaming at its price point.  I reccomend for social gamers or those restricted to a $40 budget.  You'll be satisfied with your purchase.Compared to the other headsets in this price range, these are at the top.  Serious gamers who want 5 star sound should expect to spend 5 star prices.  Decent noise cancellation and good sound quality.  USB or traditional jack option is a great addition.  Would have loved it if the braided cord was a little longer, but not a deal breaker.  While comfortable for a couple of hours, the rigidity and weight start to take a toll during extended play.  My party also said the microphone didnt always pick up my baritone voice unless I was talking louder than I normally  do and I think that is due to the short boom. They had no problem hearing my softer spoken but normal pitched girl friend's voice when she was using them.  Finally, the mute switch on the cable is very stiff and clumsy to operate.",4,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
"We got these for my son to use with his XBOX 1. He absolutely loves everything about them, the lights, and of course the sound quality and comfort.

"Got this for my Son (8) to replace a set of headphones he's been using on his computer. He was due to get something with a microphone and I picked these out to match the blue theme on his desk. I've gotta say, for the money, I'm impressed. They sound really nice, they have inline mute and volume control. The Mic has worked wonderfully, and the Blue LEDS are super cool. I'm very happy with my purchase and would totally buy again.",5,1,2020-2-14,1,1,0
"Great headphones and mic for gaming, even comfortable for daily use, as the mic is subtle! Good incoming sound quality, blocks out almost all outside noise. They're flexible and comfortable, and adjustable for the ears. With a dial to adjust incoming volume and a switch for muting the mic, these work well for co-ops!Small drawbacks of being more affordable, the mic quality is quiet and gives feedback to the listener, mic control takes some pressure to turn off, and I've gotten some rare static with certain sounds in the ears. Overall tho, great headphones and amazing price!",4,1,2020-1-31,1,1,0
"It would be better if the microphone was usable. It's not. So, ok headset, worthless microphone, but that's an important piece.Update: contacted by customer service and received a full refund. Obviously, excellent customer support! I've already purchased another headset, but I'd certainly try another from this seller in the future. Defects exist in anything,  but when supported by the seller as such, I'd chance a zero defective product. This seller gets a boost in stars for sure.",5,1,2019-10-6,1,1,0
Bought them january 29th already not working.... they worked great at the beginning.

"Had these for about a week now. Wanted to get some various use out of them before I wrote anything. So far these have been an excellent buy. The blue lights are neat and the volume adjustment on the wire is not super sensitive to turn by just being brushed against a chair or desk. The sound is excellent for games and music. Tested with a wide variety of sound styles and games (just not horror games, not my cup of tea, though it seems like these would work well because of the light noise cancelling and excellent sound quality). Gaming sounds great and dynamic location sounds work perfectly. The mic is sturdy and seems like it wont break from general use. It is a solid connection for the mic from the headset so there is no adjusting it farther or closer to your mouth, but that has not been an issue for me. The headset is comfortable during regular use, however, I did find that during an extended use (about 8 hours almost nonstop on a day off playing with friends) my ears were getting a little sore. Though I don't think most people will really use them that long that often. Overall, this has been a nice medium level headset and I will continue to use it and would recommend it.",4,1,2020-4-21,1,1,0
"Update this review dose not change how I feel about these headphones , customer service is not horrible a little pushy wanting 4-5 star but did refund the money on one of the headphones.

"For less than $30 I didn't have huge expectations.  The BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset does what my son needs it to do - he can use it on his laptop and directly in the Xbox One Controller and both work great.  The audio quality is not to the level of my much more expensive headset, but guess what, for $30 or less- this is a good buy.My son specifically likes how they sound (an upgrade to him), he has commented multiple times how comfortable it is.  He also really likes the sound adjustment on the cord.",4,1,2020-1-4,1,1,0
"I was surprise for the headphones sound because most cheap products sounds low, they look awesome very, very nice blue lights it looks like a transformer like optimus prime mouth lol, they are comfortable, only downside it was the mic, well mine doesn't work, it works before but then the sound was compromise it was very very low, noise cancellation is good enough for the price, my only problem as I said was the microphone, when I make work then the sound is terribly bad, remember to use the mic you have to use the double jack head it brings and when you put it with that then it doesn't work well, good luck, headphones are good and loud enough for games, videos and music ON THE COMPUTER …..",4,1,2019-1-24,1,1,0
Good cheap headset. After a year the cord started to stop working in certain position and I had to keep the cord in a certain position for It to work. This made It impossible to be in party chat as the headset would get disconnected if I moved at all. I ordered another one as It was reliable up until that point. New headset came in a few days and the company treats you well. They contacted me to make things better and offered me a full refund for the headset. Have not received the refund yet but was happy to see them trying to keep the customer happy,4,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0

"The only reason I got these was because I thought they'd be similar to a pair of head phones I got a few years ago.  They had a similar design but with a few slight changes.First of all, the.... ear holes are too small.  Maybe these are good for a child but my earlobes get sore if I wear these for too long.  It's a relief to take them off at that point.  Will Probably have to get another pair because the soreness is not worth it.",2,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"First of all these DO NOT WORK AT ALL for the PS4. They do work for the Xbox1 and the Nintendo Switch. We do not have a home computer for gaming. I have three boys that are all gamers on systems. we have three televisions in our living room, I do not allow them to have TV in their rooms. So having head sets that work for ALL systems was vital. So that everyone can be content and hear their games without conflicting sounds. I bought two different colored ones from this company, neither work for the PS4.",2,1,2020-1-18,1,1,0
"I reserve reviews until I've had the product for a few months so as to provide accurate info on durability of a product as well...  That said, these are a good product.  4 out of 5 stars because the microphone arm that should be able to be put in the ""up position"" won't stay ""up"" when lifted there.  There's a little friction washer that accomplishes this, but that gave way pretty soon after purchase, leaving the mic in the ""down position"" at all times.  Sometimes I use these as headphones (only) for music, etc. meaning I don't need the mic projecting in front of my face.  The inability to put it in the ""up position"" isn't much more than a minor annoyance, but doesn't take away from the overall performance...  All-in-all a GOOD BUY...!",4,1,2020-2-24,1,1,0
My sons review: I had  a broken headset and I needed a new one so I was looking all over the internet for a new one especially one with a mic. The problem was they were all way to pricey and I couldn’t be spending $100 on every new headset and then I came across this and I was like this could be the headset I wanted but I had to check other places as well and then I was 100% sure that this was the one I wanted. It was perfectly priced and it works great. I have had no issues and it is super comfortable. I really hope anyone else takes a look into this type of brand because they make affordable and really good headsets.,5,1,2020-4-23,1,1,0
"I've had this headset for close to two years. Overall, you get what you pay for with this headset. The company advertises it as noise cancelling, but it doesn't really have great noise cancellation. You can still hear almost everything going on around you, but it also depends on the volume. The sound quality is pretty good for a $20 headset, and it has pretty good bass; but after wearing them for long periods of time your ears get sore.The microphone is decent, but when I'm playing games it echoes a lot during voice chat. I like the volume adjustment dial because it fits perfectly into the palm of my hand. Unfortunately, about six months ago I started to get a static sound whenever I adjust the volume with it. If you're looking for something cheap that will do the job, then this headset is for you. If you are willing to spend a little bit more money, then you should get something else that won't develop issues.",4,1,2019-10-31,1,1,0

The headset is fairly comfortable and has a great sound. My only issue is that there is an extra long cord but I keep it wrapped up as it came in the packaging so that it does not get in the way. I also use this as a headset for phone calls while I am working and can be work for hours at a time before it starts  getting uncomfortable.

"After half a semester of intense online classes, I was in the market for a new pair of headphones. Being an avid gamer, I would not pass up the chance to invest in a gaming headset, either! I noticed these because of the incredible price, and am NOT disappointed! The sound quality is amazing and the fit is comfortable. The mic quality is also very decent over Discord, Zoom, Google Hangout and Facebook Call. The one and only drawback is that in order for the headphone lights to work, they must be plugged into something using the built-in usb plug. However, the inclusion of a free 1-into-2 headphone jack for better sound and mic output is honestly worth the lighting issue.Furthermore, the design and feel of the earmuffs are extremely comfortable, as well as ergonomic. When you place your headphones down you don't worry about them sliding off of the table, thanks to the smooth edges of the over-ear bits. The cord is long enough that I feel comfortable scooting to my backpack to pull out whatever I need without taking off the headset, and the built in remote is extremely useful for quick mic-muting (such as when playing ""Among Us"" !). Overall, a very wonderful product!",4,1,2020-10-4,1,0,1

The style is fun, the cord is excellent, and I appreciate that you can plug this into a headphone jack or a USB. If you are buying this for a child, know that it definitely has good sound control.

The design is sleek and when plugged into the PC, the lights are fun, but not needed for play and he's able to control the volume directly from the headset.

I liked it so much I bought one for my brother to use on his PS4, and he loves it, too.I know it can be tough to find a good headset cheap, you have to filter through all the bs, worry about flimsy construction and quality, etc... but if inexpensive performance is what you're looking for, definitely pick this up.

Don’t fall for the hype of the reviews. These headphones ultimately gets the job done but doesn’t do a good job. The sound is really low even with the sound wheel to the max.

However, these headphones are super basic, I was not impressed by the sound quality and comfort. The gold plated 3.5mm 4-pin plug also means nothing to me. The noise cancellation is also a nonexistent feature. The little video hypes up this product, and I grabbed these because of the price.It is LITERALLY a 20$ headset and a 20$ headset is what you're going to get.

The sound quality from the headphones are above average for the price you pay for these.A few minor concerns I found was that the wire was a bit long but if you have a zip tie, you could tie a bundle to shorten it. I would recommend this headphones for someone on a budget.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,1,0
"I mean they're $19 bucks. You need an adapter for PC or you cannot chat. The sound is awful and it does not get loud at all so playing intense FPS games it is hard to hear footsteps, clacking grenades, or directional sound in general. I only bought these because I left my SteelSeries in CO and I needed something until I travel again and bring them back.",2,1,2019-10-10,1,2,0
"I was buying this headset for online course. My major need is high sound quality, so I can clearly hear the speaker. Compare to many old headsets that I have used in the past, this headset is super. I can hear the speaker extremely clearly and the class can hear me clearly, when I speak. I also like the available volume control that allows to tune up and down the volume, so I can temporarily work on other things when I am not active in the class.The best thing that I like the most of this headphone is the comfort. No headphone can beat the foam and the ear wrap of this one. I can wear this for straight 8 hours without feeling itchy or painful. Perhaps, you would wonder how does it look and I can tell you it looks exactly like what Amazon is posting. It looks extremely cool especially when the light is on. For those, who choose this headset for gaming and music, I am certain you would not go wrong with this product.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,1
"First, this item arrived on time but it wasn't secured in an amazon box. It was delivered in it's original box as if purchased from a store. It's been 1 month and 3 days since purchase, it's no longer working  and my return time frame has expired.It worked well for the first 15 days, then my son started complaining about the sound. I tested it on my cell phone and it seemed to work fine on it but not consistently with the game (ps4). Eventually you couldn't hear anything on any device.",2,1,2020-8-10,1,0,1
"For me this is a great headset. Easy to use volume control. Mic mute switch makes it easier to secure the mute function.  I use both a PC and PS4 and the headset is compatible with both, and works well with both. Headset is comfortable, though the ear phones are a bit warm after awhile.  Great balanced sound quality.  Nice looking headset with blue lights (USB powered) .  Kind of a little frill, but fun.  Overall, a great buy.  Would definitely recommend.",5,1,2020-4-14,1,1,0
"Update: they reached out to me, which was amazing! They sent me another one to try out.. so glad I took the offer.I read great things about the headset and was disappointed to receive a defective unit but the customer service and care definitely made up for it.

"Bought these headphones to replace my Sony PS4 headset that was broken. I was not familiar with the brand, but the headphones looked nice and worked for PS4 and PC. I am impressed by the quality.

I will be getting another pair of these!",5,1,2020-4-13,1,1,0
"We got this headset with microphone when our homeschooling laptop's mic failed.  This was during Covid-19 sheltering-in-place.  We specifically needed a headset with a good microphone.  This mic works well for online Zoom meetings.  The headset itself was comfortable to wear even after three hours of virtual online camp!  It'd also be comfortable to wear during gaming. We did notice  that it'd be great in the future to have this headset with mic to go wireless with bluetooth capability for more mobility flexibility (e.g., to allow retrieval of things during a Zoom meeting class scavenger hunt while wearing the wireless headset!).  Overall, our elementary student really recommends  using this headset with mic!",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"I love this product!  I'm not an audiophile, so I can't speak to the specifics of sound quality, but I can say these do the job well.  Sound is great, both music and games.  Directional awareness is also good.  I love the versatility given with the cable adapter.  The cord seems very sturdy and high quality.  Mic sound quality is great.  But all that is honestly expected in a product that in my opinion is a commodity.  For me the big seller is the comfort.I don't like the feel of ear buds, and I wear glasses so on-the-ear headphones generally don't work for me.  Over the ear tends to be the best for me, but even then, it's common for the pressure to eventually become too much.  BUT NOT WITH THESE!  These feel amazing, which is to say, they are so comfortable that I stop noticing them.  I can wear them for hours without pain or sweat.  They are the perfect fit.",5,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0
"I don’t usually write reviews for stuff off amazon but I’ve tried using this headset and I’ll try to summarize them to rate, but I bought these to basically throw them around and try to break them. Over all you could get better sound and microphone quality in the $40-$50 range and a lot of people are saying they are heavy (which they are) but not heavy in the built to last kind of way, within a few months one or both of the speakers will stop working and the cord is way too long unless you are plugging them into a desktop. It’s the opposite of comfortable for long usage. And at this point the rgb was false advertising cause I haven’t seen anyone with working lights on them. They’re basically ear defenders with a cord, good noise canceling but nothing else. Would I suggest buying? Probably not unless you have a small child and you don’t want to buy them a new headset every time they rage at a video game.",3,1,2020-4-27,1,1,0
"My 10-year-old son received his new headphones over three weeks ago and he has been very happy with them. He uses them for music, games, chatting with friends, and Zoom meetings.He likes the royal blue color and it is very comfortable, but a little large for his tiny ears. However, they stay on just fine.",4,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"The sound quality and microphone work great, love the color.  The only negative for me was though it wears well feels a little blocky ... a personal feeling of discomfort.  Does not affect ability to use at all just a personal comfort issue that could happen with any product.  The other reason for discomfort may just be I normally wear earbuds and not used to headsets anymore.  For the price I recommend this product!!!!",4,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
I go these for my 13 year old son for his birthday to use with PC gaming. He said the sound quality coming in was great. But his friends said they couldn't hear anything he said. So he brought up some program he uses for video editing and recorded his voice and sure enough it sounded so muffled and quiet I couldn't make out what he was saying. I see another reviewer had the same issue. Returning and going for a different brand. He also needs these headphones for distance learning and I can't risk the same company sends me another pair with the same issue.,2,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"For the price I paid, these are amazing. I am a causal gamer but I’m serious about it when I do play.  I am not one for much online play so I haven’t talked to anyone through these, yet. The sound quality of these are pretty dope and I’m very particular about my headphones/earbuds/etc. These cancelled out people trying to talk to me (a huge plus when you are fourth and goal, 4th quarter, in the playoffs and being asked what you want for dinner....). Pick these up, I highly doubt you’ll be disappointed.",5,1,2019-8-7,1,1,0
"This is the first time I am buying a Bengoo product and I have to say, I am impressed. I have owned numerous headphones over the years, especially gaming headphones. The sound quality is good, can really hear the bass pounding. You can also hear the more silent sounds which are very important if you are a COD or Esport player like me. It has good LED lights like most gaming headsets. I have been using this for a month now and it still feels sturdy and durable. I would definitely recommend especially at this price point for the quality.",5,1,2020-1-25,1,1,1
"I'm editing my review, & giving them 5/5 stars. I ordered 4 headphones, several broke. Well, the company emailed me, voiced concern about my dissatisfaction, and resent me NEW headphones! They have GREAT customer service, and I would gladly purchase again from this company. Love the noise cancellation, and ability to use on ALL my devices! Great Product!!!!! & I'm not just saying it, before they broke they were great too.",5,1,2019-10-14,1,2,0
I personally like the headset but the problem is the people I play with say they are hearing feedback that is very distracting.  I messaged the seller about it and never heard anything back.  Kind of frustrating.UPDATE:,5,1,2020-4-15,1,2,0
My 16yr old son reviewed this product as he is the resident gamer at our house. He liked the way the product looked out of the box and hook up was easy. The noise cancellation was also good and he said that the mute switch design was a an upgrade from some of the other headsets he had previously had. The whole set up was light.He did think that the ear pieces were a little bit small and that would be the one thing he would improve. Overall a good headset.,4,1,2020-1-3,1,1,0
"When I purchased these I was looking for a reasonably priced pair of gaming headphones for my 9 year-old son. A pair that wasn't necessary cutting edge or the latest technology but something that was durable, made of solid, quality materials, but wasn't so expensive that I would be upset if he broke it. This pair is perfect! The sound quality is wonderful, he loves how cool it looks, and there's so much padding that it's very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. We are very happy with this purchase.Also, now the school is going to be virtual this year, it can double as a headset for that as well. This isn't like other cheaper options that will leave your ears hurting after an hour or so. The earpiece is perfectly cut so that you can hear everything without your ears being pinched.",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,1

"I got this headphone today and I returned today, let me explain why. When I decided to purchase the headphone I didn’t any second though, I was click, click, and click DONE the headphone was on its way to me. When I got the headphone, I opened it right away, didn’t wait for a second. I opened everything, read every documents it included and plugged it to my controller. The first feeling when I putting on my head was “WOW” this thing really seal my ear and block out some noise. And then I tested its sound from shooting game and my mind was blow away. The sound was perfect left and right. But then 30 mins passed, I started to feel my jaw and part of my head were getting squeeze and I started to feel some pain from being squeeze by the headphone. And I felt I didn’t buy a headphone to get a headache or my jaw being crush. Maybe if I give it a little more time it would feel more comfortable but I wouldn’t risk my jaw getting TMJ either. So they need to improve something with the headband so people with the regular size head would feel more comfortable wearing it.",3,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"So a couple of months earlier i wrote a review of this headset and it read, “I bought these and they work well, no real issue with it. However, I raged once and slammed my controller on my bed and the aux part of the headset (the part that plugs in) bent and after that it. was easily bendable and they didn't work so Idk if it's worth it though. I'm sure there are better headsets at slightly higher prices.” But now I have a new pair of these headset seeing if the last was a fluke and it was. They have worked much longer than the last and I am happy with them. Honestly I feel like my other pair may have been just a fluke, but they’re good overall",5,1,2020-5-23,1,1,0
"...  the more I wore these, the less I liked them. I'm a big guy, 6' 4"", 250lbs, and these headphones are falling off my big fat head on its smallest setting. The cushy foam that rests this set on top of my head, starts to  rub my head a little raw with minor use.... not too mention, it feels like I'm getting a bald spot where they rest. The sound quality is mediocre, at best. But that was semi-expected for the price I paid. The straw that broke the camel's back is that the microphone broke after only a couple months of minor use. Stay away from this product... spend $20 more and get something better. There are quite a few reviews that start ""I bought these for my grandkids/children, and they love them!"". I think your family members just didn't want to hurt your feeling by telling you that your well-intentioned gift actually sucks.",2,1,2019-4-21,1,1,0
They lasted all of a week! Smh!! For my teenage son... The sound went completely out... Couldn't hear anyone and they couldn't hear him... They look great though if you're just gonna use them for show smh.... I bought a pair out of the local kids clothing store that he's still using months and months past when I purchased these... The week they did work the noise cancellation was fine and so was the sound... Guess you just get what you pay for... Things the like is hit or miss but I still WOULD NOT recommend it...,1,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"Awesome surround sound headphones with memory foam like pads which make it very comfortable.

"Awesome headphones! they are definitely a great size and cover my entire ear. The sound is superior and it is truly noise cancelling. It also has a microphone that can be tucked away when not in use. The fir is adjustable and these headphones are very comfortable. They are not so tight that they hurt my ears.

It has made tremendous difference in his gameplay and is happy that he is getting to enjoy the time with his friends when they are not able to be together.,5,1,2020-4-19,1,1,0
The headset is tight and begins to hurt after a while of continued use. (If you have a small head this might not be an issue)The sound is good but a bit on the low end. Even at max volume it is not that loud.,4,1,2020-5-22,1,1,0
"I've enjoyed these headphones so much that I've bought 2 for myself (one for at home & a second pair to keep in my truck) & a third pair for my 13 year old son. I play games like Arma 3 & Insurgency: Sandstorm & being able to hear the direction of enemy fire & footsteps makes a world of difference in your strategy. I see absolutely no reason to spend 2, 3 or even 4 times the amount I paid for these ($17.84 +TAX as of Jan 2020) when you can get nearly identical results for little cost. I would recommend these to anyone who needs a pair of decent quality headphones at a decent price.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,1,0
"Great starter gaming headphones. I bought this for my 11y.o kid. Headphones is not too heavy, adjustable so it fits comfortably on my kid’s ears. The LED lighting is a plus. The sound quality and noise cancelling are good for the price. It comes with the jack splitter for when you want to use the mic so no need to buy one. Overall, great value headphones.",4,1,2020-5-3,1,1,0
"This is a great product for a great price (while it worked). The 1 star is because of two reasons...The microphone stopped working within 6 months. I am a casual gamer and treat all products with care, so having a malfunction such as this is quite the bummer.",5,1,2018-12-4,1,2,0
I am a 6 foot person about 235 US pounds (106.5 KG) and these things hurt my head.  I have never had headphones hurt.  They reach below the ears and push on the back of my jaw.  It is like a kungfu pressure point.  I might be able to use them as self defense.  Also I bought them to use on my Microsoft surface but the headphone jack and USB are on opposite sides and the splinter on these headphones is not log enough to reach. So make sure your USB and Headphone jack are close to each other.Make sure you do not need these right away.  Company will take 2 to 3 days to even process order.  Shipment date will be at least 2 days off.  Should not be prime,3,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"While I was in the market for a new headset cuz I haven't had one in a while. But being a current college student in the middle of a pandemic meant I was on a pretty tight budget. I came across this headset and decided I would have to take a leap of faith. Overall, I am currently happy I did. The sound quality of the headset is overall quite good. It helps out so much when you're trying to get that sweet clutch in SnD. I also use them for my classes as they are now mostly online. Mic quality seems to be pretty good as well. I, however, have one small issue with the headset. If you were to connect to your controller then you wouldn't be able to connect the HDMI to the console for the lights. Now it doesn't affect me as much because I can just buy an HDMI extension to fix the issue but it is something to take note of. Other than that it is absolutely perfect for anyone who needs to clutch on a tight budget while looking cool in class. 100% recommend.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"This headset is light weight and has very good quality sound for the price and is very comfortable. Microphone works good as well. Lights on the sides of the headset make it look nice.Only complaint is that this headset is meant for PC users given the fact that both the USB cable and microphone plug in are connected very close together to the cable. Meaning, that if you are playing on PS4 you plug the microphone cable into the controller but can't plug the USB cable into the system for the lights. I ended up buying a 3 foot USB extension cable in order to be able to use the lights. So if you are using anything other than a PC and want the lights on the headset while you play, then you'll need an USB extension cable.This product is very good though. Very happy with the purchase",5,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0

They were exceptional in their customer service and promptly sent a replacement headset, which works great!  We now have a very happy son and I would order from this company any time.

"The description says compatible w Nintendo Switch, but we could not get the microphone to work (audio did work). Tech support was great and actually called Nintendo to confirm the set is incompatible. This was frustrating because you cannot return the headphones, even though they are a Prime purchase—something I didn’t realize is the case for some electronics purchases.I’m not sure it’s fair for me to rate this product, but I want others to know it’s actually not Switch compatible—last I checked the product description still claims it is.",2,1,2019-9-8,1,1,0
"I didn't know until a lot of research and a number failed purchases, that ""gaming"" headsets DO NOT produce good music sound. This is expected and gaming headsets are designed to produced heavy base and clear voice. They are not for audiophiles and not suited for general purpose computer use, such as VOIP and music.So these headsets produce great sound when used for gaming, and better than a comparable Turtle Beach Earforce Recon 50P, and much cheaper.

I ended up looking for a guide on the internet on how to activate the microphone so I could play CS with my friends, but it lead to the headset going completely silent on my side, but it playing a blaring pitch on their end of the call.",2,1,2019-8-26,1,1,0

"The headphones sound solid but I've gotten cheaper pairs before with much better sound quality. The padding on the ear is very nice, but the round aspect of it doesnt comfortably fit your ear. And the wire of it alone is enough reason to return. It's longer than my phone charger and always in the way. The volume control is massive compared to other headsets which you can see in my picture. And if you're using a console, you have nowhere to plug the USB in, and all the USB is for is the completely useless lights on the headset which you'll never even see because it's on your head.... So the USB is just something else in the way. Pretty disappointed",2,1,2020-7-12,1,1,1

The speakers sound surprisingly great, it isolates audio from external / ambient noise really well, and they're nearly indestructible.

"I have studio monitors, so I guess I'm a little spoiled. I got these because I could not replace my failing Turtle Beach PLa headphones, which had superior fidelity. The location of the volume control is too low, it catches on the desk, and accessing quickly is clumsy.

"I bought these to use with the PS4 and they work great. My friends can finally hear me, now that the microphone on the PS4 earpiece isn't buried in my beard. These have really good (what sounds like) 360 degree sound. I use them on Destiny 2 and CoD MW and I can hear footsteps circling all around me. I had to purchase some new underwear from Amazon due to the bowel-releasing experience of the CoD multiplayer airstrikes that seem to actually be above my apartment, raining down deafening destruction.  Ya, so... good headset. The only downside is they are a tad noisy to others when you jostle the actual headset around, as in when you rip them off violentlyand toss them onto the couch to run to the bathroom for a pitstop to drain the last 4 accuracy-enhancing IIIPAs you slammed. But I hear that all the time with others, too, so it's probably most headsets that are flung across the room. Besides, the convenient mute switch on the headset cable fixes all that.

I been asked awhile back does my most excellent headset use much amps. Well I believe about the same as a 5 ton a/c or about the same as my electric shavers that are really cool or possibly a light in your guest bathroom with a 50 watt halogen but someone told me when I was at Jack in the Box eating two tacos and a large Squirt that amps don’t use electricity it’s the 3 phase wires that powers the flux capacitor that you have to worry about it.

I really didn't use it that much.  I'm not a gamer but I wanted a good headset so I could listen to videos and music without bothering everyone else in the house.

"My two sons are gamers and so I purchased this for one of my boys. This is a great starter headset for teens; it won't break the bank but also does the job. The size is good and the lights are cool. My son said the microphone and the sound are occasionally ""glitchy"" but he still likes the headset and would recommend it. We will give it more time, but overall are happy with it.",4,1,2020-2-5,1,1,0
"These headphones replaced some standard Xbox headphones that my dog had chewed up, and while I was upset with her at first, I think she was just trying to tell me there were better headphones out there! These can channel all audio, or just your party chat with these you are gaming with. The sound is crisp and they are very convenient. It's great if you want to game while others in your household are sleeping. 5 stars, hands down!",5,1,2019-10-13,1,1,0
"Let me start by saying, I'm not a gamer but ussually gamer stuff is high quality so I gave these a shot with all the good reviews.I expected more from a gaming headset that supposedly has surround sound. They are good headphones with good sound, however there is no surround sound. They are analog headphones. The usb just powers the LED lights. Personally I feel the lights are unnecessary and a little cheesy. I don't plug them in and waste a USB port and then I just have that USB dangling from the end of the cord.",3,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"The reason why I am leaving it a 4 Star is because my kid has to put the USB into the Xbox in order to have the lights onand he is really close to the tv, like about 2 inches, plus even though he turns down the mic it still echos a bit but it’s no big deal. On the other hand it is a great headset so far, the sound quality is really good and he enjoys it, if you are getting this headset and really want it to light up and you play on console I don’t recommend you getting it.",4,1,2019-5-22,1,1,1
"I've owned several other much more expensive brands of gaming headsets. My last (very expensive set) went out on me and when considering a replacement, I took a chance on this cheaper version.  I wasn't disappointed. The material quality was amazing and the sound and build quality was outstanding. If you are debating on what gaming headset to get, these won't disappoint!",5,1,2020-1-22,1,1,0
"I waited a couple months (bought them in January of 2020) to post this review to see if the headphones held up over time.  With that in mind, you cannot beat this headset for the price.  I have four kids and several headsets for them to use for their home school instruction online; as well as their own personal time on the computer.  The sound quality is excellent.  The design is great for someone who wants to have them on with a lot of noise going on around them and not be distracted.  I have a few other headsets that my kids us but they fight over this one and when it comes time to buy another set I'll be buying more of these.The one downside to this headset is my kids informed me they can't use it with with their Xbox which is why I gave it a 3 star for gaming.",4,1,2020-3-6,1,1,0
I first bought this Headset to replace my old Sony headset.I did not like the need to plug the headset into the controller so I returned it.,5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0
"While the headset is comfortable and the sound is clear, after two months of light use, the headset quit picking up sound and the microphone was not working. On my computer setting, everything seemed to be working just fine, but when using it in Discord, Skype, etc nothing worked. The program settings for those applications did not recognize the headset. I don't think I overlooked any settings on my system or on the programs either. Super disappointed.",2,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
So far these headphones have exceeded my expectations. The fit really comfortable and the sound quality in the earpieces is amazing for the price. I love the color scheme on them as well. They can be connected via traditional headphone jack or USB which is great as I play on console and pc. My son tried them out and wants his own. The only thing I can find that could use some improvement is the mic pick up. When it tries to cancel.out some background noises your voice can get a bit muffled. No biggie though and for the price I'd definitely buy them again.,5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,1
"To start off I have used this product for gaming, it is awesome!! The sound quality is great, plus it has built in bass. And the noise cancellation is very good as well, it is also very comfortable to wear, and fits my ears very well. The lights also look very cool, and it comes with a adapter so you can plug it into the microphone and headphone ports. Another thing to mention is that the USB cord is for the lights and is not necessary for sound. The microphone is hard and can't bend but flips up and down, and is very clear so your friends can hear you well. Overall very good product and i highly recommend.",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"Audio quality is great with this headset!  I ordered 2 (one for my husband and for myself).  I love the LED lights on the side, and the mic works great.  (Note if you're planning to use this with a PC, you may need a splitter/adapter to make the mic work.)  I've had great success using this with Roll20, and on video chat meetings/hangouts.  These headsets should suit your needs!",5,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
"I am a laymen in this area. I purchased this item with Comfort 1st. Affordability second. Sound last but not least. A good audio system can make most audio sound good thru decent headphones to the laymen such as myself. High Quality  Headphones  is a compliment I think, to a good audio setup. I have no plans to broadcast  and I am not bothered by outside noise, in fact I want to hear what is going on around me. Try speaking to your child with noise cancelling headphones on. I cannot rate it on Noise Cancellation, but when I received them I was surprised at how durable the cord was. I destroyed a expensive pair of Beats due to a flimsy  cord.  So add Good Looks and Cord Durability to the headline, and you get BENGOO G9000. It's just my opinion.",4,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0
"I'm writing on this account as someone who received this headset as a gift; there are better options. Let me say that now, because if you're looking for an actual headset, you're better off getting a different brand altogether. The microphone simply doesn't work; I spent a good few hours troubleshooting the thing, seeing that my computer doesn't even recognize a mic is plugged in, and giving up. It either plays nothing, or plays direct feedback from the computer itself-- why? The USB is *just* for the lights on the headset, too.For games, it varies. Sometimes the sound gets really washed out, sometimes it's just fine. For music, it's incredible. I sincerely think that's the part it's best for. The customizable volume wheel is nice, too.",2,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"This headset has been serving my boyfriend well for several years (about 4). According to him and from the few times I've used them, they work exactly as they're meant to. The sound quality is great and he has definitely used the noise cancelling feature to ignore me lol.  The only downside to the headset is that the foam part at the middle meant for the top of the head will start chipping, but this is only after several YEARS of nearly everyday use.  This is the second pair my boyfriend is using. His old pair is still working fine, it's just the chipping of the foam that prompted me to get him a new one. His gaming system is PS4 and the headset is very compatible.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,1,1
"I was sincerely disappointed in this headset. It was an Amazon Choice product  and I have to say, it should not be.The sound quality absolutely  SUCKS. I could barely understand another person and they sure as hell had a problem hearing me. As i had gotten this headset to do my work taking calls at home, needless to say, they do not do the job.",2,1,2020-3-26,1,1,0
"Received them last night. Husband was really excited since his last headset just broke.  He loved the feel of them and they really did cancel almost all noise. He said they were very comfortable. The second he plugged them in he said the audio quality was great until he would slightly bump the bottom piece of the cord where it splits and it would cause severe static and feedback. I bought these because of the massive amounts of good reviews and ratings it had, so I'm hoping this is only a technical issue....***UPDATE*** Manufacturer sent a replacement immediately and they work perfectly. My husband loves them and is happy. I am very pleased with the fast response from the sellers, and how quickly they worked to correct the situation.",5,1,2017-9-27,1,1,0
"We purchased the headphones, for our son, in July. Overall my son really likes them. They're comfortable and the sound is good quality. He uses them with his XBOX One. Definitely would recommend.**UPDATE: In November, sound was coming from one ear. I contacted Bengoo to find out about their warranty and was pleasantly surprised by their response and service. They provided options for troubleshooting and when that didn't work, they sent a replacement. We will buy these for our other son when his current ones break.**",5,1,2018-12-10,1,1,0
"I picked these up for the kiddo, be sure to note that the LED's on the headset only work when the USB cable is connected.  The problem is for kids playing console the audio and usb cable are molded together, so when playing console if they want the LED's on then you have to run a male to female usb extender from a nearby usb port.  When playing on PC, not an issue cause usually both those ports are next to each other. Besides that, price for performance is great, fit is good and kid really enjoys them.",5,1,2019-1-24,1,1,0
"I have needed a gaming headset for the longest time for my PS4. I have been using some $5 headphones that were compatible with the PS4 and they weren't the best. I found this headset while browsing through Amazon and decided to purchase it because it was in my budget and it had quite a few good reviews. After receiving the headset, I plugged it in my PS4 and was stunned on how good the sound quality was and how the glow lights on the side shined blue. The sound quality is very well balanced and it has a good bass to it. The noise cancelling is great as well. For example, my dog barks at random things and these things blocks out my dog's loud barking. I would definitely recommend this headset to someone who is looking for a good pair of headsets.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,1,0
"Seem like good headphones, great price. I don't know if this is normal, and I am working on filing a complaint about it, but mine arrived with a glitchy wire (you can literally see the amazon box they came in behind me). They fit nicely and don't make my ears hurt when I wear my glasses, but like I said, the wire is messed up somehow. I have to wiggle it around in order for the sound to come through properly. When the sound comes through properly, it sounds great, but when it is acting up, the sound comes through tinny and awful. @sellers, can you please help me with this?Update: After a few days, I noticed that the microphone wasn't working (my computer automatically compensated and had been using my camera's mic this whole time). I returned mine and got a new pair, but these have the same problem. My review has dropped to 2 stars, because no matter what, the sound that gets through them mic is absurdly quiet, so that my computer almost doesn't register the sound! The audio works fine, but the mic is worthless. I'm going to have to buy a set from another company...",2,1,2020-8-30,1,0,1
Works great for gaming. My daughter loves them for her xbox. Cord really short to make it light up so she never had the hooked up. But after a few months it hard to get them to hook up to the xbox she has to play with cord to get it to connect.Update: The company contacted me and sent my daughter out a new headset. They were really nice. They offered me the money back or and replacement. My daughter choose the replacement because she needed them to play Fortnite with friends. She was so happy that they would replace a item that showed its self to be defective after a few months. I am beyond happy that a company cares more about making something right with its customers then trying to make money. They could have just pushed me under the rug but no that wanted to make sure we were happy. That is why I have updated my review,5,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"I bought these just to use for quarantine Dungeons and Dragons sessions (hurray for social distancing!) but honestly, I love them so much I'm going to use them all the time with my phone.The music quality is insane.

"Christmas Present delivered 11/21 opened for Christmas and the mic does not work. Tried to return, but it’s not returnable. Don’t waste your money, big disappointmentUPDATE: the seller contacted me on their own and offered to make it right by either refunding or sending a new item. We opted for the new item and this one actually works great. We do appreciate the seller reaching out to us and fixing the issue. Thank you",3,1,2018-12-26,1,2,0
"First of all, the customer support is AWESOME! - I got my headset a few days after I ordered it and it turned out that one side is not working so I notified them and right then and there they replaced it with a Red one(as I requested because it just goes along with my computer so good , lol), no questions asked. The first one was Blue and they both look AWESOME! I love the lights.Anyway, besides the awesome lights, this has got to be one of the most decent(sound wise/quality) and most awesome looking headsets out there and for a very sweet price. I mean a price like that for a headset like this is very cheap. I repeat...the price is very cheap for what this headphone's worth.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
The headset was really good I use it all the time to play rainbow six siege. They’re comfy and I like the design. My friends have no troubles hearing me nor do I hearing them while listening to both in game sounds and then talking. It’s a very good balance! One thing that I do have a problem with is the end that goes otro the controller. Why? Well because a it sticks straight out. In the future Yal should try impelennt the end that has like a flat side so that it won’t stick out so much I will attach photos of an example. Although also it’s kind of hard to use the LED usb on the headset while playing console but it isn’t gonna kill my like for them. Over all great headset. The third picture is the kind of plug that should be added,3,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Amendment: we had initially written a two star review, (see below) and the company contacted us and replaced our headset free of charge, and promptly.  I understand that products sometimes fail, and knowing that there is great customer service behind the product is far more valuable.  We are very happy with the new product.Initial two star review: The headset works ok, great for kids. The disappointment of this product is the Headset does not glow which is advertised in the picture.",5,1,2020-5-2,1,1,0
"I bought this headset because the one i had was too small for my ears and would sit on my outer ear and hurt after a while. These speakers are big and go around my ear, so they don't get physically sore from pressure on them. The microphone on these does not bend, however. I like the bendy microphone on my old headset. This one is just a very hard plastic and it doesn't extend or bend. These also don't really get very loud or cancel out noise as i thought they would. They're alright.",3,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"The G9000 is a great quality headset for the price compared to bigger name brands out on the market. There is no noise or static, Surround sound works well, and it is perfect for Playstation gaming. I wish these headsets would light up without the USB connection but beside that it is a great product, it arrived nicely and as described, and I've been using it for about a week, and I'd make this purchase again so far, as long as it holds up and lasts.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,1
Just for fundementals I really like how responsive the volume dial is! I have larger ears and they are a bit scrunched but not bad to deal with. That's what the four stars. Sound is great and they are light weight! I have tried many pairs of headphones for my Xbox these take the cake on weight! The cord is not hard plastic but braided which is key to me because I lose headphones due to taping issues but I don't see that as a problem with these. I will update post once I have furtur used them!,4,1,2020-5-22,1,1,0
"Overall, very satisfied. Let’s face it, we’re buying this headset because we don’t wanna spend 100-200 bucks easy on top brands. And for 20 bucks, this set is absolutely comparable. The sound quality is good, the mic is good. Is it gonna blow out the rest of the industry? Nope. But it’s damn good for 20 bucks. There is a voice chat echo if the game noise is too loud, which is the reason for the star deduction. Easy recommendation for anyone not looking to break the bank.",4,1,2019-4-3,1,1,0
"This is a bargain headset so I wasn’t expecting a lot but it works really well. I can hear all of the nearby footsteps in Warzone. Comfort was also a main point for me since I play for hours at a time, and these are incredibly comfortable. I just ran a 6 hour gaming night and the headset stayed comfortable the entire time. The ear part isn’t as big as some other headsets which I think helped - others are too oversized and weigh down after awhile. These fit my ears well. I’m surprised and impressed by the Kotion Each headset.",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,1
"So the headphones are great. As far as I can tell the mic had good pickup. They're putting out great sound. I wouldn't say they're noise cancelling. I'd need to have them much much louder to be noise cancelling.Here's my problem. The LED lights don't work. It's obviously not a deal breaker for me. Buuuut. If I buy a car and it says it comes with 4 tires, it should have 4 tires.",3,1,2020-5-10,1,1,0
"In the new distance world, where school, work, and extended family talks are now mostly done online, we, as it turned out, increasingly need good microphone. Laptop mics generate echo and usually pick up many noises. Same applies to kids and their classes, to make sure their foreign language teacher heard it correctly. Got this headset for my child. It is well built, sturdy, able to withstand abuse. I like the ability to regulate sound level and mute mic from the cable controller. Ear pads and head cushion are soft and feel very nice to my touch. The headset is relatively big, compared to other regular options. Blue light feature has no function, but makes kids for some reason very happy :-) Quite long cable can be kept with provided fastener. Well designed and executed headset. Recommended for distance learning, when cool t-shirt is not visible from laptop camera, but a cool headset with lights makes kids excited.",5,1,2020-10-5,1,0,1
"Originally I wrote a bad review for these. And the company reached out to me actually through email to try and make it right. However, I didn’t respond to them, but it made me think that they were standing by their product, which is impressive.So ultimately I went on YouTube and researched why they might not be working for my son and it turned out to be a simple upgrade was needed for the controllers.  Son now is happy and all is good in the world.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,1,0
These gaming headphones are perfect for a gamer young and old. My son loves these. They are great for my younger boys because not only do they work well they are not super expensive so if my boys are too rough with them it's ok. My son wears out headphones like crazy but the sound on these ones works great and does not fo out. These are the 2nd pair we have ordered. We would order again.,4,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
Great look great sound. My first gamer headset. If your like me and this is your 1st headset once you plug it in to your ps4 you have to hold down the PS button on your controller ans go up to sound/devices and go to output to headphones and put all audio on. 4 stars because you have to have an extended usb to have the lights on it work they dont just automatically work as expected. I had to search the internet for a few minutes to figure out what to do since its company is from japan and has no customer service phone number.**** edit after having for a few weeks its still great only thing is i wish it wasnt so heavy. Maybe I'm just still getting used to headsets but i have to take it off after a little while. Great sound.,4,1,2017-12-19,1,1,0
"I had a couple of headsets before, most of them were too big or too small and instead of them providing comfort for my ears they made my ears hurt.On the other hand these headphones(BENGOO G9000) are perfect ,they came earlier then expected. The sound and mic sound pretty decent and it feels good on the ears and I could wear these all day without any troubles. Also i love the braided cables they feel nice and don't break as easily.Cons could maybe that the usb sometimes gets in the way , the mic is on the left side which isn't ideal for me but I'm fine with it.So basically",5,1,2020-10-2,1,0,1
"I use these head phones for my Xbox One.  They work perfect to hear sounds when playing and talking online with people.  They do not cancel out noise, I knew that ahead of time and was not concerned about it.  The USB to plug in to get it to light up seems pointless.  I only plug it sometimes for the light.  Overall this is a great gaming headset for the price.  I also use it for work conference calls.  People have said they can hear me perfect and I can hear them perfect.  Overall, great headset for the price.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,1,0
"Honestly, I bought this not expecting alot considering the price. But the generally positive reviews made these headphones seem much more credible and so I went ahead and purchased these.My old headphones had become no longer usable so I really just needed something to last me while I looked for more long-term products.",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,1
"I previously used a turtle beach head set for 7 years until they finally broke. Since I am a light gamer, typically only on weekends if time allows, I decided to purchase a “cheaper” headset. I believed that with technology advancements over the past 7 years that even a cheaper headset could live up to the expectations of an old, outdated, yet reliable turtle beach. Instead, I discover this China made beauty makes the perfect paper weight. Gaming noises are muffled, voices on chats are muffled, it’s uncomfortable, and the thinly made exterior looks as though it could break at any moment. The images on Amazon lead you to believe the sides light up. They do not (false advertisement) I have since duct taped my broken 7 year old turtle beach headset and continued to use them. Save your money and buy something better. It will last longer, have higher quality sound, better comfort, better noise cancelations, and you will be much happier.",1,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"Highly recommend these headphones and here are some reasons why. It came super fast it estimated a week or more but ended up getting it in 2 days. Very comfy and works great as advertised, looks amazing love that it lights up and is very light weight. Also love that it comes with an extra splitter for pc so you can plug it in for mic and headphones which I forgot to check if it came with but no worries there. Overall very great headset!",5,1,2020-4-10,1,1,0
"I’m glad I was able to get this great head set on the first try. The padding protection for ears is comfortable, sound is pristine, adjustable volume feature and LED light are cool. This headset will work for Xbox one but the lights won’t work because one of the cords is too short. A bonus feature that I am pleased with is the fact that any app I view like Hulu or netflix through my Xbox, I can here the sound for it. Overall I’m satisfied with purchase.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
Bought these as a gift for Xbox gaming .  Preteen kids only used them at home.  Never took them out of their bedrooms and one still only lasted less than 4 months.  Really disappointed bc they looked nice and seemed to work well during the 4 mo period.So I contacted the seller and there is a 12 mo warranty.  They are promptly sending out a replacement headset!,5,1,2019-3-24,1,1,0
"EDIT: The seller contacted me and offered a replacement or a refund. They were prompt and quick with their response and I love that kind of customer service. I would give them another opportunity in the future.They look great, they sound ok, the mic worked fine until one day it stopped working. My son was just playing and the mic stopped being detected and nothing can be done. My son did not tell me about it until just now and of course, the return window closed 5 days ago.",4,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"I brought this for my mother who is into online gaming platforms...things like the Sims and Second Life. She cannot type fast and was looking for headphones that were comfortable, noise cancelling and had the mic ability.  Although these look more for young gamers, she loves them. She can hear clearly and people can understand her when she talks. She also said they were far more comfortable than her last pair and believes they will last longer too. She gave them 5/5 stars.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
"Wow, this is the best headset I found and it’s is budget friendly. It’s has great comfortable ear muffs. Air flow is great on the ears my ears didn’t sweat. They are multi-platform can be used on PS4, Xbox, phone and PC, Tablets. The noise canceling mic works and sounds good using it for podcasting. I like that the volume control is easy to use and close enough to use. The sound quality is awesome. It has surround stereo subwoofer. Which have great bass, can be comparable to the bass in Beats.In conclusion these are the best on the market budget headset. A must buy if your into video games, podcasting and computers. Very worth the purchase.",5,1,2019-11-17,1,1,0
"This headset is very high quality and I am happy with the purchase.  The only thing that would be nice is if the adapter needed for the mic and headset to work with a pc at the same time was included. This may not be a issue for a PS4 or Xbox, but for a this headset to work both microphone and speakers, you will have to purchase a adapter if you are using it on a PC. Other than that I am happy with my purchase. Great quality and I cannot wait to game with this headset!",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
Headset ordered as a replacement set for my son for the PS4.Looking at the set the headset is very well made and light in weight. Fits to head securely. Microphone is clear and able to be turned off with ease.,5,1,2019-12-3,1,1,0
"These head phones will make your friends hate you. They feedback everything that happens in game to everyone in your party chat and unless you love to hear your friends complain then you will not enjoy these. I should note that we had tied up a large amount of time trying to fix this issue and couldnt figure out a work around, also my tv was muted so the noise came from the head phones themselves. However, if your doing solitary play these headphones are great, they're comfortable, and have a good sound. But if you want to play with friends you have to switch them out so really I would advise just getting a different set. But again that's just me and I dont prefer to endure complaints.",2,1,2019-9-27,1,1,0
"I enjoyed this headset for it being around that $50 mark, I believe it is the best headset for the price. Obviously it won't give you the same comfort, sound quality, and mic quality as a $100+ headset, but if you are looking for a great backup to use for a couple of weeks while your main is broken or you don't want to invest more than $50 into a headset this is the best option. The directional 360 sound is OK, I can hear footsteps pretty well, and the headset gives you a general direction of where the sound is coming from. In games like COD Warzone which rely heavily on footstep sounds while in buildings I can hear audio ques and footsteps very well, also the reverb for quick and snappy sounds like gunfire and beeps is much better than I expected. Overall the headset is a fabulous choice for people who want a casual experience and don't need to hear every precise sound and have the greatest crystal clear mic quality. The mic quality is good but soft, my friends could barely hear me on normal settings in PS party, and I had to turn up mic volume all the way to get a normal sound, which is fine.",4,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"Arrived on time and well packaged. It came with all the adapters I should ever need. Great sound and very good noise cancelling. Feels very comfortable. I have  been using it for online meetings, some which go on for over 4 hours. Still comfortable and I almost forget I am wearing them. Very good cord length for moving around.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,1,0
"I love how it lights up and feels comfortable. The top cushion is very soft. i do wish there was more bass and it went a bit louder. Its ok, and you can hear foot steps when playing COD but it could be louder. I wish it had a battery for the lights though or it could plug into the other port next to the headphone jack on a ps4 remote. Oh and also a bit bulky for the look, wasnt too uncomfortable when laying in my recliner though, almost dont feel it pushing against the chair.",4,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"I got this for my seven year old son so he can play video games and now he is also using it for his school online classes. It's prefect because it blocks the noise from the room so he can focus on what the teacher is saying without having to turn up the volume. Since I am working from home as well we're not bothering each other. The design is really cool, lights up, he got really excited to wear it and show it off to his friends.",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,1

"Great product, only problem is thati bought it for xbox one, and there is no usb port on the xbox one controllers,  so there is no way to power led lights. The headset itself works great, but kind of annoying having the usb cord just dagling next to the controller. I can plug in the lights using an extension cord but that is kind of a mess. Next time i buy a headset ill definitely get one without the fancy lights. Im certain these are perfect for pc gamers though so dont let my review discourage you. But xbox one users just know that you wont have full functionality with this headset,  the sound is great however and the mic works perfectly.",3,1,2019-3-2,1,1,0
"The sound on these is good, not perfect but quite good. These aren't great as a headset for me, since they require use of a separate attachment to work as a 3.5 mic/headphones set on my tower, and the USB connection is only for the light. I will be using them for listening to music/books/movies on my computer but likely not for gaming as USB is a better option for me.",4,1,2019-12-24,1,1,0
"Disappointed over time. The quality seems strong at first but really falls apart. I have not played a single game in which the person I am playing with does not complain about the static on the feed, even if they are literally in the same house. It is heavy as well and can slip off due to its inability to hold tight to your ears. I would skip this one and find one with higher quality for the price. Be ready to return it.",2,1,2020-1-23,1,1,0
"I like the headphones, the mic and sound quality are great for gaming. The usb powered part is for the lights. The only thing is that I can't adjust the cord so the usb and audio output isn't close together. If I plug in the usb |I have to keep it real close to my head, that part should be longer or at least readjustable for better use.",5,1,2020-3-22,1,1,0
It took a while to figure out how to get the headset to work with the Xbox One. Called Amazon (has 90 tech support with this product) and got AMAZING customer service. It works so far on both the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One systems. My 14 year old is very happy with this one. The price is really good and as a member also has perks. Hoping these will last fsr longer than the last ones my son had. Recommend these.,5,1,2019-10-18,1,1,1
"First of all, the design is really cool and the lights on the muffs look good as well. Second of all, When they said that it works with every device, they weren't lying. The Microphone even works with my iMac, which many headphones don't work on). And lastly, They really care about their customers, where many companies don't and only do it for the money, and gives a card to redeem for gifts on their anniversaries.",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"I have several high end headset and was not expecting much from these. I got them for my kids virtual learning so did not need anything substantial.. well let me tell you. These are incredible! Not what I was expecting. Absolutely stunned by the sound quality and comfort. If you are looking for a $30 headset.. look no further. These will not disappoint. If anything a touch too much bass, but can control that in any pc sound settings.",5,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
"These came quickly, as an early birthday gift for our son. We recently moved out of state and having with friends online is their way to keep in contact. His headset died and he was lost without his friends. we found this set on Amazon and it arrived quickly and is great! My son loves his new headset! The noise canceling must be amazing because he never hears anyone talk to him when he's got them on his head 😂😂",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
One day after the warranty. The microphone quit working.And I try to select a button to get help and it wants me to enter a phone number so they can call me but no matter what phone number I put in it always tells me it's wrong which is very frustrating the product itself seems good other than my microphone issue and sound quality is nice. It's a little smaller around the ears but for my son that works great,2,1,2019-9-22,1,1,0
"I bought these headphones for my son for a dual purpose, for games and for virtual classes.He has used them on PS4, Nintendo Switch, Mac and iPhone and he is very happy, they are compatible with any device.",5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,1
"Product was great for my son and his gaming while it worked. About 2 months after he started using the product, it stopped working. My husband and I have checked over all wires and connections (our son can be pretty rough on headphones) and nothing is out of order. We have even tried plugging them in to different electronics and the result is still the same. The lights have stopped working when the USB is plugged into the computer. Very dissappointing considering our son recieved these as a birthday present.",2,1,2018-12-4,1,1,0
"It lost a star because the high range seems weak.  That is the bass pushes a little to hard and overwhelms the overall sound.  Though this may have something to do with gaming, for music it is a little annoying.  I hasten to say other than that, the headphones deliver on comfort and good sound overall.  The plug-ins were confusing at first, but I figured it out (probably me, not the product!).  It is most definitely worth the price.",4,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"This headset is great for its purpose and price. The sound quality is pretty good and when used for gaming. If you can fit the headset perfectly to your head, it does great at noise cancelation while gaming. But when sound is off, it is not best used for noise cancellation. This headset plugs into controllers, phones, and computers. The led light display on the side is only activated when using the USB attached to the headphone cord. If you're just attaching it to a controller, you won't be able to use the light function. Bummer. You can also get a warranty on these when you buy. But overall, for its price, I would definitely buy these again or recommend to someone who isn't trying to spend a fortune on a headset.",4,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
"I bought this headset on sale for a great price after reading the reviews online. It was one of the only brands under 20$ that had great reviews and I felt that I could trust. The product shipped earlier than expected, the sound quality was better than expected, the noise cancellation was as expected and the overall experience was above average. The headset fits perfectly over my ears and are comfortable. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to gift a cool headset with light up features as well as ANY gamer with any console. If I had to write a complaint I would say that the wiring of the USB with the headset jack input is slightly bulky, but it hasn't bothered me yet during any play. I will definitely look for products from this company in the future!",5,1,2020-2-2,1,1,0
"Frustrated because the reviews looked solid, but when I got the headset I couldn't get the mic to work, I checked the Q&A's on the product and saw that tons of people had issues with the mic. Even people that got it to work initially appeared to start having issues down the road.As headphones they were pretty decent. I wish they had more adjustment options as they were a little small for my head, but sound quality was totally fine. Unfortunately, not having functional mics defeats the purpose of getting a gaming headset and the mic seems to be a pretty unpredictable/low quality aspect of the device so I can't recommend to others.",2,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
"I didn’t really research headsets, dog broke my last one so was just looking for a relatively cheap decent headset that was compatible with Xbox. Overall I’m super happy with the quality(I did have a 15 dollar headset before), the volume has a good range, my friends say the mic sounds good and doesn’t pick up nearly as ambient noises as previous one, the noise cancellation obviously isn’t perfect but I’d give it 8/10 on noise dampening. The only downside I’ve found is that, even though it’s comfortable, after wearing the headset for more than a few hours it made my head feel squished and needed to take a short break from wearing it but could just be from finally wearing a decent headset and I’m just not used to it yet.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"I love the braided cable on this product. It feels very high-quality. I also appreciate the multiple connection options (USB, 1/8"", and an adapter that splits the 1/8"" out into mic and headphones in case you want to connect to a device that has those separated out into different inputs). The product is solid for the price - but what really blew me away was the seller. This seller knows how to engage customers and I will continue to look for products through them.",5,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
I was very skeptical of this after my hyper X cloud 2 broke.  My hyper X plugged into the usb and it was hard wired.  Having to plug this in my controller I was skeptical for sure.  But I cannot tell a difference between the two what so ever.  It has great sound and sounds very clear. I even tested the base and frequency on YouTube.  It actually has better than base than hyper x cloud 2 lol.  Anybody getting this will not be disappointed.,5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"They headset is very comfortable. I always wanted a pair of over ear noise cancelling headphones mainly to hear music and program with a more clearly defined sound. It fits over the ear, so there is no pressure on the ears. These are amazing headphones. They have great noise cancelling feature that really works. These are very well made. They feel solid, and are comfortable to wear for long periods of time once you've got used to them. Volume is good and it's nothing over bearing. I enjoy the balance sound that these have. I don't find them to be overwhelming in the low end or high end which helps me with some audio production projects that I have going on. Good noise cancelling ability, they reduce noise outside of the headphones so it makes the music even better quality as you don’t have the sounds of those around you over the top. Nice quality microphone for calls. Overall, I am impressed with these headphones - very functional and they sound great.",5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"The quality of the headset is pretty good, especially regarding the price. The overall feel of it is great, with adjustable sizes and the option to turn off the microphone on the wire of it is also pretty useful. I tested the surround sound and microphone quality on multiple systems (PS4, PC, and iPhone) and video games/music all sounded pronounced. The LED lights are also fun, if you're into it, but have to plug in the USB for it to work, rendering things like PS4 controllers basically unable to use this function. My only gripe about the product is the condition of the box, which as pictured, is pretty smushed despite the fine state of the amazon box it came in, though the damage didn't affect anything.This is a good product for a good price and one that when on sale, is a great purchase.",4,1,2020-1-25,1,1,1
These are close to turtle beach headsets and the quality shows. I’ve only used it for Xbox but the sound settings and ease to communicate is shown. The only awkward thing is the stuff is on the left side of the headphones when most people are used to having it on the right. Quality is good enough you can/should hear footsteps and stuff in game.,5,1,2019-12-19,1,1,0
I bought this for use on my personal desktop PC. This headset did come with the splicer for PC use witch I was not expecting.  However the build quality of this device just feels like a really cheap plastic toy. I gave it a shot. Plugged it in and the audio was so low I could barely hear it. I turned all the volume controls on my PC and on the headset to max and it was a lilttle louder but still very quite.  Sending back for amazon credit.,2,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"I like how comfortable these headphones are. They don't press on my head/ears as much as other headphones have do that I have. These are also not so much as 100% noise canceling, since I could clearly hear my brother talking about 20 feet away, but still blurs out outside noise decently during gameplay. Great surround sound feel when playing my games too. (Games that require good sound to hear the enemy team footsteps, for example). The cord is a little long, but that's understandable for those who need the length. (I personally do not need so much length on the cord). Sleek look and would definitely recommend!",5,1,2020-5-21,1,1,0
"My 14yr old had a set (other brand) and my 16yr old had the camo version of these. My younger's broke and he literally, begged me to get him the same pair as his brother because he couldn't believe how comfy his brother's were. He's so happy now that he has his own. Definitely recommend",5,1,2020-4-29,1,1,0
"We just received the Bengoo gaming headset and my 8 year old son really loves them. They work great with his Nintendo Switch, Nintendo 3ds, and our PC. He loves how great they makes all of his games sound, and that they light up when he plugs them into our PC. He likes that he can control the volume on the cord, and he really likes using the noise canceling microphone when he is creating his coding games. They are extra comfortable too, with really soft cushions. We just found out from a message from the company that we get a 12 month warranty with this headset, and that just makes them that much better.",5,1,2019-5-28,1,1,0
The headset started off working great but after a few months the microphone stopped working.  My son could hear his friends but his friends could not hear him.  Very disappointing quality especially since the seller's description of the headset stated top quality.  I emailed the company hoping they will remedy the defective product.  **I was amazed to receive a message from the company in regards to my experience with the headset.  They were very apologetic and offered a replacement or refund for the defective product.  The fact that they contacted me to ensure I was completely satisfied and gave me 2 options to remedy the issue is almost unheard of these days.  In hind sight the defective product was probably just a once in a while issue just like other companies and their products.  I will definitely give this company another try and purchase their products.  Awesome customer service.,5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,1
"My headset broke so I picked this one up on Amazon. I was nervous because it was way cheaper but it works great! My PC wouldn't use the USB plug it came with, it worked when I used the Headphone/Mic jack converter that came with the headset, but that may be because we build our PC and don't really know what we're doing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Either way, works great! I love the controls on the wire so I can mute or change the volume. That and the blue color is awesome.",5,1,2019-2-6,1,1,0
"I got these headphones for my son who is an avid gamer.  He's gone through a few (and some expensive) headsets because, well, he's 11.  Right away, he liked the cord and how durable it looked.  When he played with the set, he informed me that the noise cancellation is very good and the sound came in clearly.  Good headset for the price.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,1,1
"I just got this yesterday on Feb 23. I plugged them into my PC using the pink and green splitter. I was able to get sound and I have to say the sound is amazing but no matter what I tried I could not get the mic to work and I plugged and unplugged it in many time. Also, my computer would not recognize there was even a headset plugged into it. I had to order a new headset because I really need a mic, but as i said it is not a bad product just did not work for me.  I always say judge things for yourself.",2,1,2019-2-24,1,1,0
"I bought this headset for my son because the old one wasn't so good. This headset is great!!

"After the first few days of distance learning this fall, it became quickly apparent that my 8-year-old needed a more comfortable set of headphones for being in front of a computer for several hours every day. His basic set just wasn't cutting it and we needed him to wear the headphones so he wouldn't disturb his brother who was also in class and working at the same desk. This set of gaming headphones works great - it's comfortable and fits his head well without squeezing. The lights are an added bonus since it makes him excited to wear them. Having an integrated microphone means he doesn't have to shout to be heard.",5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones as a gift for a friend. I month later we were gaming and he said he had to set his new headphones. I asked why, I had given those to him a month ago. he said he had to by a new pair because the ones I gave him died. Was disappointed in the quality of these headphones. They should have lasted a year or two, not a month.",2,1,2019-12-25,1,1,0
"I recently got this item in order to replace my aging gaming headset. Unfortunately, after the item arrived, it does not work at all. The lights on the headset itself are clearly on, indicating at least some power is going from my computer to the headset, but instead any audio I get ends up coming out of the main speakers on the computer instead of the headset. Even worse, I can't even manually set the headset as the default audio device, since regardless of if I plug it in via the USB or headphone jack (and it is frankly bizarre that the makers decided to try and do this weird duel-setup with two plugs when every other gaming headset I know of just uses standard USB) neither the sound settings in Windows 10, Discord, or even Device Manager recognize it as an output device, no matter what I do.I have tested this with both my laptop, and my main gaming PC, and had the same issues on both. Therefore I can only conclude that the issues are with the headset itself and not anything else on my end. Therefore I am giving this headset the lowest possible result that I can. Do not buy it, no matter what.",1,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"It's a headset with a mic, It works. The mic only goes down on one side, not reversible, the sound quality is pretty poor, ear fitment is bad, overall has an extremely cheap feeling, cable is way too long, came with a card inside the box to leave a positive review for amazon, wasn't worth the gift card offered. if you're looking for cheap and quick like I was, it will work just fine, if you're looking for quality, keep scrolling.",1,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"Well made but the sound quality is not the best.  Bought it for a language program I have and frankly sound quality is probably more important for that than for gaming.  Pronunciation is the key to learning a language and this unit falls short.  Will use it then for gaming which is its original design.  In fairness, for the price, the unit is well made.",4,1,2019-11-17,1,1,0

"This is not a downfall or it could be. When plugged into either an XBox1 controller or PS4 controller with the 3.5mm jack the lights on the headset won't work. The USB connection most be plugged in to do so. It would have been nice to have the 3.5mm connection automatically have the lights on the headset work without the secondary USB connection.  Say you own a PS4 & as I do & have a USB controller plugged up but also an external drive, well there goes the USB connection for the headph's right?? WRONG !! just get something like a 4 port hub & plug it into the controller port & then plug in BOTH the controller & the headset. This option would work on the XBox1 as well. I got theses headphones for around $35 would I pay $80 for them probably not, I bought them because they were on sale & I wanted to see how they compared to Turtle Beach. Over all I'm very pleased with my purchase because the light thing is a tiny tiny problem that has several great work around's for any platform. They work great with Consoles,laptops,PC's.",5,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"I previously bought this headset in red for my brother and he has been using it for some months now and he has been nonstop complimenting it since he got it. So because of all his positive feedback, I decided to buy another for another boy in the family. I have to say I was a bit worried it would not be as pleasing to him as it was to my brother, but he absolutely loves everything about it. The sound is clear and the buttons work as they should. I would highly recommend for those who enjoy gaming and just to gift as well.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"I purchased this headset for my 14 yr. old son, I asked him to place his review rating and comments: ""Cheap model, bulky build, would not recommend."" This was his overall review. I asked if there were any pros and his response was: no, he mentioned even for it to light up the cord had to be plugged in to the console, making it too close and uncomfortable.",2,1,2020-4-30,1,1,0
Ordered these for my son and he hasn’t  to put them down yet. So I’m concluding that he loves these freaking headphones. I would say the only drawback would be that the cord is very long that comes from the headset so Very careful because he broke his last pair because he stepped on the cord. However as I stated he hasn’t taken them off yet AND he purchased them again which means that it must be a pretty good product.,5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"This headset is very nice.  It is comfortable on the ears and does a good job keeping out ambient noise.  The LED lights are nice and bright and give the headset a cool look.  The reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 was that I had to spend some time to get the microphone to work.  Windows settings and control panel did nothing to fix the issue.  I had to open the ""Realtek audio manager"" and change what it does with the headphone jack.  When I changed from ""headphone"" to ""headset"", the mic was now recognized.  It works great now.",4,1,2020-8-31,1,0,1
"This headset was my first buy, and after playing with it for only a day I found it to be quite a great choice. It has very good noise cancelling, extremely good gaming sound, especially for games like Rainbow Six Siege where you essentially need to hear your enemies. It works on Xbox, PS4, and PC as far as I know, but it is definitely worth the buy. Bought it twice so far and was not disappointed both times (one for me one as a gift). I will say I have dropped it multiple times by accident, and I have seen absolutely no affect on its physical and running capabilities. I was quite happy with that as that is a feature most headsets will not offer. Worth the buy!!!",5,1,2020-1-30,1,1,0
"I was looking for a reasonably priced headset for my XBOX One and this set fit the bill. I haven't plugged in the USB to get it to light up, but the headphones are comfortable and the sound is good.

"The headset came on time, it was packaged nicely and also came with a adapter even though said it wasn't included. I bought these for my xbox one S, but I plugged them into my phone to test the sound and quality of the microphone. Both sound good and on par for the price!! I can't wait to see how they hold up in the long run. I would recommend these for adults too, as they fit my 23 year old head. They aren't too heavy which is great since i have been playing for 10+ hours lately due to covid.",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0

"I'm using these now and they're good.  Sound quality is excellent.  One small problem is that to use the microphone you have to very carefully adjust things or you get feedback.

"I'm using this product for both work and gaming, it works pretty well but it is a bit bulky and the cord is quite long so it swings around quite a bit when It's  plugged into my phone or switch. Thankfully I don't have to move around too much while wearing them, but they are rather lightweight even though they look on the heavy side. The design is also very cool looking but as I said I'm using them for work so I'm worried they might seem a bit unprofessional on zoom calls. However Overall a very good product and the call/music quality is much improved over my last pair of earphones, and I especially like the built in speaker which I use constantly to talk to customers. It even arrived a day early form amazon. :)",5,1,2020-4-13,1,1,0
"This headset is amazing for the price you pay. It does feel a little tight after a few hours but for me thats to be expected. noise cancellation works great and can't really hear outside noise when the headset is not playing sounds. The speakers are VERY loud on max settings (you can adjust this easily) so if you prefer to go def at a young age I'd highly recommend this headset for that reason alone.UPDATE: Noise cancellation has started to fail, and the microphone picks up the slightest noises from your surroundings which causes my party members to be annoyed. I've also found it quite difficult to hear people talking through my headset over any other sounds playing in the headset.",2,1,2019-4-15,1,1,0

"I got this headset because it was relatively inexpensive and had good reviews, So far the quality has been much better than I expected for the price and I have not had any problems with the headset. The sound quality is great and so is the mic making it a rather high-end gaming headset in my opinion. The one mild problem I have is that the mic is as it says in the description omni-directional meaning that if you are in a noisy environment it will pick up a bit of background noise, I do wish that the mic could move closer to your mouth but it is not an issue for me. I would definitely recommend this headset to any one who is just starting at gaming or who would like good quality but is not willing to pay a large amount.",5,1,2020-4-1,1,1,0
"I like the colors on this headset, matches my computer and keyboard. The sound is good (but not as good as my logitech gaming headset).

"I've never owned a set of gaming headphones because I don't game. I ordered these because I work from home and the headsets my job provide break every few days. I was looking for something cheap but had better quality than what I was used to and these do not disappoint! The mute function on the headset doesn't work, but everything else seems to be holding up. I'm very happy I went with these! Not too heavy, I can wear them for a few hours before I start to notice they're on my head and the mic quality is very good.",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"Definitely doesn't cancel out noise. Super disappointed it has to be plugged in to light up. Main feature I was looking for. Can't go very far with short cord. Guess it's ok for intent.Update: Now not able to hear the players but can hear game music. Restarted the game, unplugged earphones, still nothing. He wanted them for the ourpose of chatting.",1,1,2020-3-8,1,1,0
This headset is awesome. I was trying to find something I could use for both Xbox and Playstation and my only options were console-exclusive headsets or something in the $200+ range. These headphones don't have top of the line sound-quality but for what you're paying for it's pretty damn good. It works seamlessly with both consoles and integrates well with Game/Chat audio ratio settings (i.e. prioritizing party chat audio over game audio). Very happy with this product and would highly recommend to anyone on a budget.,5,1,2019-12-20,1,1,0
Ok so the cord is a good length.The volume selector is ok.,2,1,2019-5-8,1,1,0
"I bought these for my Son to use with his PS4. He first plugged them into the console like his old headset and they didn't work, but lit up.  The instructions weren't very helpful, because the print wa so small I couldn't read it.  So I went on line and seen that there was a 3.5 mm Jack on the controller and to plug it in there.  I take it if I get a USB to micro USB I could it in and get them to light up.  My son loves them for gaming and using them with his tablet at times.",5,1,2018-12-18,1,1,0
"The first thing you notice is how comfortable they are. The longest gaming session I have had with them so far was just over 2 hours and my ears did not sweat or feel too tight. I almost forgot I was wearing them. Sound in game is great, the Price is even better!Overall these are really good gaming headphones that are extremely comfortable.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,1,1
Update: The company reached out to me via email several times and kindly provided a replacement headset. The replacement set appears to be working fine. THEY (the seller)  initiated a replacement based upon this previously negative review. I am glad that they took the time to address the issue. Many Thanks!Old review: Bought these for my son's birthday. He opened it yesterday. It broke after one day of use. Not even kidding. It is outside of the return window unfortunately since I bought them in advance of his birthday. Total junk. :(,4,1,2018-12-21,1,1,0
"I bought this for my 10 year old son to use with his xbox one. He says it's one of the best headsets he's owned and hes owned 3.  That ear pieces are not adjustable he does not like that.  It does a good job canceling noise around him, he can't hear his brothers while they're in the same Room.  But other than that it's a really good to headset.",4,1,2020-1-26,1,1,0
"I've seen many gaming headsets, but these are truly great quality with wonderful sound.  Was bought for my wife and now I really want a pair.  The noise cancellation is pretty good as well, but I have had better, but once your playing, your not going to hear much outside the game anyway, so still pretty good.  Overall, I highly recommend these.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,1,0
"We got this for our daughter who is in virtual school, thanks to COVID. We do not use the headset for gaming, so the lights are not relevant for us, but they do work. She sometimes uses the headset just to have less background noise to help her focus on schoolwork; they help, but aren't perfect at noise cancelling. The headset works great for the Zoom meetings and audio book listening that she participates in. I recommend them.",5,1,2020-9-29,1,0,1
"This product is fantastic. The noise cancellation is truly the best part of this product so I can hear my games while playing (which is great when you have kids!). The sound quality is really great also. The only con me and my husband has was that the cord is very long for PS4 gaming. Obviously it’s long for computer gaming purposes though, so it’s not a bit deal.",5,1,2019-12-5,1,1,0
I bought this because I play Destiny 2 online and you literally have to have a headset/mic to do endgame content like raids because they are coordinated. So I found these on Amazon and decided to give them a shot after reading the reviews and I am not disappointed. They sound good and the mic works great. Did my first in game raid the day after buying them and it went without a hitch. Thanks!,5,1,2019-9-13,1,1,0
The headset fits very comfortably on his head and rests well on his ears. The noise cancelation doesn't cancel out everything. We had to turn up the volume some on it in order to make it more canceling? if that makes sense. There was a part during the game chat that the volume wouldn't turn back down but it was easily fixed bu unplugging and reinserting it. It seems quite durable especially in a household of children. It's able to be thrown against a wall and still be perfectly fine! Overall the headset is pretty nice and we'll have to come back and look for similar products in the future!,4,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"I've had these for a while now and I generally like them. They muffle background noise which helps immerse myself in games/music.The only issue I have is that I cannot seem to get the mic to work. Games like Fortnite seem to want to use my default mic on my laptop only. If I disable that mic and try to force using this one, I get not mic.  Do I need the USB plugged in for the mic? I assumed it was just for the LEDs. Either way,  I'm not unhappy",4,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"I bought this headset due to a recently surgery that restricted my movement to a chair, thereby leading me to invest time in video games. Although my head is fairly small, these headphones still fit very well—so well, in fact, that they are very comfortable (loose but stable) and can be taken off rather easily while still maintaining a sturdy grip on my head. The noise cancellation is superb and I believe that the volume dial is an exceptional addition. The cord is very long, which I ultimately zip tied in a bundle but can see where one would get great use of its length. I would recommend to pros or novices! 5 out of 5. -Zac",5,1,2020-3-1,1,1,0
"Do not buy if you have a gaming system other than PC. Only one earphone worked with my PS4 and the speaker does not work. This is made for a PC and they do not have adapters to fit the PS4 ( or I assume Xbox) controller.Edit: They claim to have changed manufactures and will refund my money (IF I change/delete my review). I am not a huge fan of bribery in exchange for a changed review, however it is honorable to improve their devices and make right by the customer. For this reason I have upgraded to 2 stars. I can not give 5 stars for a (newly manufactured) product I have not received and will not delete a review of a product I’m not entirely sure has changed.",2,1,2019-3-9,1,1,0
"So far I am liking this Headset. The only issue that I have is that while it comes with a USB  and Audio jack you have to actually use the jacks to get any audio. With the adapter provided it will split into Mic and Audio channels. When I initially plugged in with just the USB only the lights came on, I was thinking that like some of the other headphones that I have used in the past just plugging in the USB will provide the Audio as well. Alas I don't care about my headphones lighting up because that is an aesthetic that I don't personally see.Audio Quality once you plug in with the jacks is on point.",4,1,2020-1-4,1,1,0
"Sound quality is piss poor, microphone sounds like I'm talking into a dirty sock, USB cord is unbelievably fragile and will tear VERY easily. Absolutely terrible.Edit: If I could lower my score even more, I would. Over a YEAR LATER, I am still being spammed by this company telling me to delete my comment in exchange for a refund. Not to mention the pathetic attempts to guilt trip me by saying things such as, and I QUOTE, ""This is the task assigned to me by my boss, which involves my performance appraisal. The economic development is not very good recently. Please help me out.""  With EVERY support rep giving me the same obvious sob story. These headphones are the CHEAPEST quality you'd expect from such an inexpensive headset, and a staggering waste of money. Get an entry level Logitech instead.",1,1,2019-2-6,1,1,0
First off the blue version is so cool looking.  The sound is amazing.  I didn't know what I was missing by not using these headphones. They are very comfortable also.  Fit my 12 year old grandchild perfect and me a adult.  This company is very accommodating for returns also.  Within 45 days you have free returns.  I don't think you will need to return these at all.  With that being said why wouldn't you buy these first .,5,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"It's not the best product, but i guess it s good for what I paid for it . I thought it was wireless, but i was wrong. It wasn't marked wrong, but I wasn't paying attention. Anyways, noise is okay. Haven't bought the wireless, and don't know if i will. The noise cancellation part is not all that good. It does have a very long cord. Overly long. A good 4ft. Which is way too long, and can get snagged easily. It's okay for the money, but next time ill save a little bit more money and buy wireless somewhere.",5,1,2019-1-14,1,1,0
"I first purchased this headset and had issues with it not working after a very short period. I made a review stating my dislike and was reached out immediately by the seller by email. They offered to reimburse me or send me a new headset. I chose to have a new headset sent out. The process was very fast and their customer service is impressive. We have had zero issues with the second headset. Sound, volume, and mic work great for my son to use while on his XBOX one. Thank you for going above and beyond for your customers.",5,1,2019-8-3,1,1,0
"Update:2 After Reading, my review...the manufacturer offered to send me a replacement. I am updating my review as a sign of good faith towards the company.Update: DO NOT BUY. The microphone quit working a week after I bought it. The volume is very low.",4,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0

"Everything about this headset is astounding. Starting with the soft cushion underneath the top of the headset, it’s wonderful and holds the headset in place and it doesn’t slide. The ear covers are perfect! They’re comfortable, not to small, noise cancelling and the right size for me. That there alone definitely kept me in the zone while in the middle of gaming. Let’s not underestimate the sound. Omg!! It’s theeee best! The capture of every drop, bass, whisper, and tone of every sound is exactly what I needed and wanted to hear. I could go on and on but I’m not. You can understand my excitement by my description. So basically what I’m saying is.. I’ll get this same product again and again if needed. The only thing that I am requesting is a longer LED extension. I can’t have my LED cord  connected to my PS4 and controller at the same time because it brings me wayyy to close to the t.v. and that hurts my eyes.",5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,1
"when first placing the gaming headset over my ears i  was impressed with how comfortable they are.  They do a great job of noise cancellation.  The when activating the headset and playing i love the sound.  There is a good balance of bass and treble.  oh yeah, the bonus is they look great.  Also, they offer a 2 year warranty and 20% off the next order.  Give them a try.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"These are amazing. I tested them up against some other headsets costing well over $100++ and these easily came out on top. Comfortable and with excellent sound. Cord can be a bit massive, but it's also durable.Would HIGHLY recommend these to any gamer who wants great sound and voice transmission without shelling out huge bucks.",5,1,2018-4-12,1,3,0
"It does a good job of noise-cancellation. Maybe not perfect, but for the price, it's more than good enough. I found the headphones to actually be pretty comfortable and the mic picks up sound really well. If you need a headset for your PS4, you aren't gonna beat this without spending a ridiculous amount. And honestly, even then, you won't really gain that much.",5,1,2018-2-8,1,3,0
"******UPDATE****** Bengoo has contacted me several times in order to make this right and have also changed the wording on the listing so it now includes that you need the adapter for the xBox One.

"Bought this headphone with microphone for my son's online classes. It fits well on my 8 year old and he said it's very comfortable. Sound quality is good. Yet to try the microphone and the light on gaming but I'm sure those would work out just fine.

"My son is thrilled with the headphones & mike. He says they are much more comfortable than the last pair.My concern is the Amazon person who delivered them just dropped them on the stoop. These headphones did not come in a cushioned box, they were taken off the shelf & ""dropped"" on the stoop. Fortunately they seem to be working. I posted the ring pic on my Facebook page because I was shocked at how it was delivered.",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
"In honesty, my first gaming headset  broke because the wiring had broken so when i had unboxed it and had an overview, i was pleasantly surprised. the wiring is covered  with a durable leather and i believe the way it is wired inside will help it last for a long while. The ear part and the microphone piece is made of plastic. Although i do not mind it myself, it is worth to be known should others have a preference. The sound is clear and has a decent surround sound. The noise cancellation works, although i can still hear my fan whirring which is about 7 feet from me, it works pretty well. The reason why i am not giving it a five star noise cancellation is that it does not fully block ALL sound. Which is a good thing since at least i can hear other people in the house if they ever yell for me... Or an intruder, but i digress.",4,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"The headset looks good, is so comfortable I can forget I'm wearing it, and it blocks the right amount of noise (not all of it, but enough where it helps me keep focus.) The sound is crisp and the bass comes through well. The mic is a big upgrade over my built in laptop mic. I enjoy the volume wheel and the mic mute controls on the wire. The wire is decently long, about 6 feet. It has a USB plug and a typical audio jack. The USB plug doesn't seem to do anything but power the blue lights on the sides, and it works well without it. The wire is protected by that interwoven style of insulation, so it has basically zero risk of ever breaking. The headset itself feels sturdy, and it is adjustable, but it takes a little force to open or close so I don't think it slipping will be an issue. Extremely happy with the quality considering the $30 price, hopefully all of the features hold up with more extended use",5,1,2020-10-4,1,0,1
"First, the headset is definitely worth the price, and thankfully I bought it on sale.It isn't heavy and fits comfortably on one's head. As for the audio/sound quality it's great. The bass is really good and the audio is really clear. In my review photos I attached a pic of the specs for this headset. I play Rainbow 6 Siege and I can clearly hear footsteps, devices being placed, etc. in game. So it makes for a GREAT gaming headset.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,0,1
"The noise cancellation is amazing, the ear covers are comfortable, and the lights are awesome. The sound is clear, and you don't have to turn them up very loud to hear everything. The only issue, which was a problem because they were purchased for this, is that PS4 or XBox One Controllers can't handle dual input apparently. (Tried both.) Plugging the single plug into the controllers means the audio plays but the mic doesn't work. On a PC, where you can use one of the 3 different connectors it comes with, there is an adapter for split mic and audio, and it works amazingly well! The USB also works really well. I am buying an adapter, so we'll see what happens with the PS4 and XBox when it comes.",4,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"Works great. I can plug them into my Xbox One controller and hear everything. Noise cancellation for when I want to drown out the background noise. Great for when I’m up late playing games and my fiancé is in bed. Only downside is they get uncomfortable after a while. Compared to the more expensive ones, I’m happy with them and will continue to use them",4,1,2020-3-3,1,1,0
"OLD REVIEWMy son loves this head set. It had a crackly in the microphone from the start, but only every once in a while. But it only worked for about 5-6 weeks. Long enough for the return policy to go out. Then the microphone started crackling like a defect in the wiring, and eventually stopped working altogether. We are on a fixed income and it is expensive to pay $20 for 6 weeks of working order.",5,1,2019-9-17,1,1,0
"Overall this is a great product for the price. Upon first impression, the plastic exterior feels a bit cheap. The sound quality and mic are great so it'll fulfill your gaming needs. The colors pop and lights make it shine even more. It is comfortable to wear for long play sessions. The cable is long so you can sit comfortably away if needed. The added splitter is a nice touch. It did feel slightly small for my big adult male head but it was still comfortable. Overall I would recommend this headset.",4,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"Don't let them fool you when it shows that this is on sale for $69.99 down to $29.99 because this headset is honestly so bad you would feel like you are purchasing it from freaking 5 below.

DO NOT BUY!",1,1,2020-10-4,1,0,0
"Awesome Gaming Headset with very superior design. Love how the lighting looks when the LED lights are on especially in the dark. The headset sits comfortably on the head and is the perfect weight for a gaming headset. After continuous hours of use my ears are still ready for more gaming time. The headset expands easily to fit any person. The headset easily adjusts to fit nice and comfortable on my grade school kids as well. The surround sound quality is fantastic. The design of the ear pads and material used makes for great sound isolation even without using any noise canceling option. The LED lights require a USB plug in and the only use for the one on the headset. The speaker and mic run via the y-cable which is permanently attached to the unit. A dual benefit for school age children is they will be able to effectively utilize the headset for virtual school classes during the Covid-19 school shutdown as well. This is a great headset for the entire family. It is affordable, light weight, has great features and is durable!",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,1
"If you want a headset that has lights, then this is it. If you want a headset with good sound and mic, look elsewhere. Took several plug-in attempts for my system to recognize this was even a headset, and not just speakers. Even with maximum volume set (on headset, computer, and the app) this headset is hard to hear the sound (think library level conversation), although sound of your surrounding environment is still easily heard despite ""noise cancellation"". These are great if you want no one to hear what you are listening to, including yourself. As for the mic, it's nice decoration. Practically screaming into the mic barely registers in voice applications, my wife could hear me downstairs, the audio app couldn't hear me with the mic 2 inches from my mouth. Maybe the set i received was just faulty, but there is a reason quality headsets require software and drivers.",2,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"What’s not to like  about this product it’s comfortable on the ears as well on my head. When I’m playing the surround sound works very well, the lights is a cool edition to it very easy to use straight forward. I don’t have a pc yet but will soon have one and will update this review once I get it the microphone is only ajustable up and down but it capture all my vocals, and cancels out other noises around you and can adjust the the audio on the headset which not a lot of headsets have that function. It’s very clear when other people are speaking to me a product well invested on.",5,1,2020-4-17,1,1,0
"For this affordable price, pretty good noise cancelation, sound is good. Will say high marks to company for no hassle honor of warranty. about 4 months in the sound was only in one ear.  Came with offer for free extra warranty so apply for it.  contacted the company for replacement and received in reasonable amount of time. Zero hassle! Really was surprised by that, so kudos for good customer service.",5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
I had the older version so i decided to try and upgrade and OMG i love these gaming headset. The quality is great. It work for xbox or PlayStation even the computer.

I love how comfortable the ear pads are on your head in the past my ears hurt after about an hour with these i can wear for many hours without hurting my head or ears. I love the adjustments for the volume on the cord itself. the sound quality is superb and I would have expected for this quality a much higher price tag. I would not hesitate to recommend to a friend or to purchase again if i ever needed another pair.,5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
The headset comes with an adjustable sound volume that works great when I want to either lower or increase the volume without having to touch my computer. I also really like how clear the sound comes out and the noise cancellation is perfect. When I am playing a game I feel as if I'm a part of it thanks to the sound. I have also listened to a lot of music using the headset and it feels like I'm at a concert just for me. Overall if you are looking for a reasonably priced headset with amazing sound this is it.,5,1,2020-4-13,1,1,0
"I purchased this headset about a month ago to use with my Xbox One. Thus far, it has been perfect. I like the quality of the sound from the headset, and the microphone relays my voice to my friends crispy and clearly. The headset creates a nice, quiet background and I'm not bothered by my phone ringing (can't hear it over the headset). There are hundreds of headphone choices out there.

"Are you looking for quality game time and don't want to spend so much money for a quality headset ? I too had run into this issue. Searching the internet endlessly for a good quality and cheap set, I had finally found the right one. This headset can easily adjust to fit anyone's head of all sizes. The pads and cushion are ear friendly for long gaming periods. Especially for me having to wear glasses, other headsets would eventually cause great pain and discomfort to my ears. This headset is easy to use with an adjustable wheel to volume and level. LED lighting gives the set an artistic style for gaming. Attached to the headset is a microphone that picks up accurate and clear voice to the other side. Though this headset can also be used for a lot more then gaming.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,1,0

I've purchased this item twice. Each time they've lasted me about a year. I paid $22 the first time and $19 the second. They're cheap headphones that work decently well. Comfortable and clear audio.I only went to write a review because they popped up when looking to purchase a new headset... because these broke on me... and amazon said they're on sale form $60. Don't buy into the price hike to sale. They are NOT $60 headphones. The sale price is actually higher than what i've paid for them twice before.,4,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0
"First off, the sound quality is great. You can mute the mic with a switch located by the volume control on the cord. The cord is braided which helps so it does not bend easily and expect it well make it last longer. There is an adapter included so if your computer has a separate output for speakers and microphone, this will still work well for you. It lights up blue if you plug in the usb cable or go dark by not plugging it in. The headset will still work great either way. My only complaint would be noise canceling. It works well, but not great. The mic does well to filter out background noise. If you flip the mic up, you can still be heard, but it is quieter. This was recommended to me by a friend who has used it for a couple years and she really likes it.",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,1
"After less than 3 months of use with an XBOX one, the 3.5mm audio cable bent and frayed quickly, rendering the audio and mic functions inoperable.  Bengoo responded to Amazon rating comments and sent a free replacement after my return, which is good customer service.

Great quality",5,1,2018-4-1,1,3,0
"My son uses it for gaming on his Xbox. it worked great at first but now there is no sound coming through the headphones. The mic still works, but the headset does not. We A/B tested with my own pro headset and everything works fine, so it is definitely not the controller or the Xbox, not a software issue. Would not recommend purchasing this brand ever again.

Will update review once they've met their end of the commitment.)",5,1,2019-7-8,1,1,0
"I use the headphones for communications in-game with my friends all over the USA. We play World of Warcraft and need to be able to hear each other in endgame raiding and PvP and it works great. The sound quality is much better than my laptop's and is easily adjusted on the wire. The only slights I have to point out are that the mic must be on the left side of your noggin because it only goes one way, in other words there is no way to have the mic on your right unless you have spawned a second mouth on posterior. Also these do not perform any kind of noise cancelling, such as a Bose headset.",4,1,2019-1-11,1,1,0
"Got this since my work provided Jabra headset was not performing well.  This is literally a headset; it is quite big (in a good way) but I also love that it covers both ears, you can plug it into a headphone jack (to give your usb port a break), the mic isn't all in your mouth since it is shorter in length, and chord is braided so it will not rip.  Works very well with my Macbook, overall A+++++",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,1
When i saw some reviews for this headset i considered them before buying it. Things like how the thick wire is always in the way and the second plug as well. I later realized that the thick wire also means that it wont be shredding any time soon. the sound quality i love and its not too hard on eyeglass wearer's considering the size of the ear hole. My friends can clearly hear me on the other side as well. So far no complaints. Easy to adjust the head size as well. It fits ps4 controllers and connects easily because it is wired.,5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"UPDATE: After posting my previous review (below) the company contacted me and apologized for my bad experience, they offered to send me a new headset free of charge- they didnt even ask me to send the old one back, which is super convenient! We r/c'd the new headset within a week and it has been working great! No glitching, the microphone and earphones work consistently. My son even uses them to watch tv, which for some reason the old ones would never work for. Very happy with my experience and the customer service at Bengoo went above and beyond. 10/10 would reccomend.These have glitched off and on since we got them. Sometimes the mic doesn't work, sometimes its the speakers, sometimes they'll both work at the same time. Had them for about 7 months now and finally just replacing. They're garbage and the price has gone up $20 in the last 7 months.",5,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
For the price its really good... Music is loud and a lot of bass... And games like call of duty is amazing you can hear everything.. One thing though is after a little while it hurts my ears but besides that it's really goodEDIT : I'm returning this headset after 15days its messing up ... when I'm playing with my friends I hear them fine then out of nowhere they get lower and lower until I cant hear them anymore but they can hear me .. it's very frustrating,5,1,2019-10-3,1,1,0
"I'm 8 years old and I really like the headset. What I like: sound quality is perfect. Long cord so I don't have to sit on top of the TV. The lights look really cool but there are two cables to attach. One for the headset and one for the lights which makes it kind of hard to use because I can plug the headphone part in my controller but if I have to use the lights I have to plug the USB cable into my Switch. Overall, it's a great deal and a great product and I'm really happy I bought it. No regrets. It is a little big but not too big and it's comfortable.",4,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones about a year ago for my Xbox one. They still work great, only complaint I have there is no way to adjust the game volume and the the chat volume separately. Usually, this ins't an issue but when playing a game like call of duty modern warfare which is very loud it can be hard to hear your friends over the game volume.Also, don't even bother with the light the aux jack that goes into the controller and the usb for the light are so close together it is impossible to use at the same time. Other than these complaints i have had no issues with the headphones what so ever.",4,1,2020-5-19,1,1,0

"I have 2 boys who love to be on their game and also are now ""distance Learning"" which required them to have head sets that also have a mic which would work on both their chrome book and their game systems. I have tried a few others and had to send them back do to not working on one or the other. This one has been great we have Xbox, Switch, and computers and these headsets work perfectly on all of them.. they are comfortable and the boys really like them just wish they had a different color so it would be easier to tell which one belongs to whom..",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
After watching multiple headsets in the $20-30 range I decided to buy this one when it went on sale for my kiddo. It shipped and arrived quickly in great condition and by all accounts seems to be really good quality for this price point. It's comfortable and works perfectly. Definitely would recommend to other parents looking to buy their preteens and teens a gaming headset.,5,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
"So, I have never bought a gaming headset before and so I was green to all of this. When searching for a headset for my PS4 I did a by best rating search and this one BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset came up. I thought I would check it out as I liked the look and the price. I had no idea how it would sound. And then when I got it, I REALLY REALLY liked it and think the sound quality is SO awesome. Again this is my first headset, but I am TRULY impressed with the sound quality. The Midbass is great and the clarity is great too. Really the only ""problem"" I have is that the aux cord and usb are attached at the same point and offer only 10 inches of reach which makes it unable to connect to the usb port on my PS4, so therefore I lose the capability of the lights being able to work. I hope they fix this in the future. But otherwise this is an AMAZING headset in my opinion, I just wish I would be able to use the lights. If you are a PC gamer then you will be able to use the lights. Overall Great Purchase and Very Very Satisfied",4,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
I bought these for my 11 year old son who is obsessed with Fortnight and the Xbox One platform. They worked fine at first but he started having issues with the mic which I traced to the headphone jack/cabling.  Applying some pressure to the cable near the headphone jack corrected the mic issue for short while then it stopped working completely.  Forget buying a 4 pole replacement jack because the wiring in this headset is super thin.,2,1,2018-12-18,1,1,0
"I got this for my son to use with the Xbox One and he had zero issues with running with it and he was very happy with the results. It's also been used with the computer with no problems. I've tried it myself and the sound quality is pretty darn good. The only reason I gave it a 1-star ding on noise cancellation and sound quality, is I am used to using my Bose headset which probably isn't a fair comparison; since the Bose is much more expensive and something I wouldn't give to 12-year-old to use on a daily basis. But at this price point, this is a really good value with no regrets. Received the item faster than expected so good job on the seller's part.",5,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0
If my son's happy with it I'm happy with it. I tried it out and the ear pads are a little too small .it doesn't cover your head completely but it is still no problem. I question the quality because of the way the plastic look. it looks like a toy lol. But he says he has no problem using the device and he's happy so.,4,1,2020-1-27,1,1,0
"They work great, way better then a pair of 150$ turtle beach headphones. Great directional sound, only problem has been the audio cuts out sometimes on one headphone side but is easily fixed by adjusting the volume a touch..... now granted I have a toddler who likes to randomly pull on stuff so I attribute the problem to having a child (three remotes for Xbox down in less then two years because of them lol) and not the product.",5,1,2019-9-26,1,1,0
"I got these headphones for voice chat on discord, and haven't had a single problem. They are quite comfortable. I was able to get them connected in under 5 minutes.

"This product has exceeded my expectations. First of all, the fit over my ears it great. Very comfortable. I plugged it into my gaming laptop and wow! I was immersed in the game. Sound is very clear and crisp. I felt like things were all around me. The microphone worked great too. I was told that my voice was very clear. I absolutely love these headphones and would recommend them to any one.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,1,0
I paid allot of money on a Razer headset only to regret it. The top pieces of that headset kept falling apart and breaking less then a year. Sounded great but the material is cheap. So I decided to try this headset & It sounds great & feels so much more comfortable then my previous headset. I think the sound quality is better too. Worth the buy & saves you allot of money. If I have to say any downside is since I play PS4 the lights need to be plugged into a plug of its own. But if your not worried about the lights this is ideal.,5,1,2019-5-13,1,1,1

"Awesome headphones, the fit is comfortable for playing for a couple of hours. The clarity of voices in playing COD are pretty decent. This is my first headset and I’m fairly new to online gaming but for me it works. The fit is a little big (on a woman’s head) and the noise cancelling isn’t great (maybe due to the fit), however like I said, for an occasional user it does the job. Also the sound quality is pretty impressive, it allows me to hear details within the game that I would not usually hear using the tv sound bar.  I’m most impressed with the shipping and delivery. Product came sooner than expected which was a huge bonus!",4,1,2020-4-13,1,1,0
My son loves these! He’s 6 and fairly small. I got it for his Nintendo Switch. They only light up when plugged into a power source like the PlayStation. They are comfortable and I guess not a bad price for the quality. I am not familiar with what prices should be on headsets but the reaction I got when my son opened his package and how excited he was that they lit up was def worth every single penny!,5,1,2020-3-6,1,1,0

"I bought this headset after my other headset (not the same brand) broke.  It arrived very quickly and works really well.  It's very comfortably even after hours straight of use (whether gaming or working from home).  The only thing I wish was different, is that the USB is for the LED lights rather than for the headset sound, thus you have to use the aux cable that comes with it.  Other than that, a solid buy.",5,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0

"These puppies are like none other headphones I've used and have exceeded my expectations as both a gamer and a college student. The quality of noise will vary depending on the device you use them with, however even still, these headphones will give you the most pristine audio you could ask for, especially for video games and movies. I can put these on and feel completely immersed in what I'm doing, whether it be Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege knowing where everyone is at any given moment or watching Avengers Endgame, feeling like I'm really in the middle of the action with the 360° sound. The noise canceling is also really great; canceling out almost 100% of the noise you can pick up from like a bus trip or a party or whatever else you might experience. Speaking of experience, I'm sure these headphones will last me quite a long time, however they can be fragile if abused too much. All in all, this product is well worth every penny and I cannot wait to put another pair on my head. :)",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"I bought this headset for my son just recently to complete his PC gaming rig.  He's 12 and uses it to play fortnite, Star Wars Battlefront, etc.  The rest of the family will play with him and at least in fortnite when he's speaking into the mic he sounds very clear.  I tried the headset myself and the noise isolation is pretty impressive.  The downside is he usually can't hear anyone else in the house when they're trying to talk to him outside the room, but that's probably a plus for most people.  For parents you will probably have to walk right up to them to get their attention, but I'm sure the kids will love that.  Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised by the performance of this headset.  Time will tell how long it lasts.  Given the other options, price, and performance I think it's a 5-star product.",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0

"The Good: Comfortable, if not small, earphone cups; just covered my ears, and thick, sturdy cableThe Bad: The cable configuration: USB to power the headphone lights and mini-RCA for transmitting audio are 6"" apart, so you cannot take advantage of audio and lights at the same time when playing Xbox One",2,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0
Bought these for my 8 year old grandson to use with his Xbox One.  It states that it is compatible in the listing.  Never worked and unable to remove it off of mute .

UPDATE - The company reached out to me a few weeks after I wrote my review to let me know they had a 1 year warranty and are sending me a new pair of these headphones.

"I will say that this item is does what it needs to do, allows someone listen to their games and music. I appreciate at that it comes with converters for versatility. It was a little snug for me so I had it set aside for my other setup that my friend uses. I will admit I have a pretty large head, but she seems to like it. I was informed that it's pretty breathable so they don't have to take breaks from what they were doing like the last headset.  Additionally, the sound quality they said was just as good if not slight better than their last headset. With that being said, it was a good investment!",5,1,2020-1-25,1,1,1

An excellent deal. It's not Beats headphones or anything but it cancels noise really really well and lights up when you insert the USB to your PC.

"I bought this headset back in 2016 and they lasted me almost 4 years using them daily for gaming with no problems at all. Only after the 4 years did the left headphone stop working, but it goes to show how durable and usable these headphones are.

Definitely worth the purchase back then and probably will be the only headphones I wear for the next couple of years again!",5,1,2020-8-18,1,1,1
"I was always the type of person to buy the turtle beaches and the more high end type of mics but I found myself buying a new pair every 5 months due to a problem within the mic. I just changed to the new kotion each pro gaming headset and it works phenomenal. The noise it creates is just amazing you could hear every little movement in a game and that's what I look for in a headset. Not only does the mic light up on the sides but they also have noise cancellation where you can't hear outside noises. I not only use them for gaming but also use them for my phone and my computer. A very good price for a headset and a reliable one. I would recommend this as your number one option when looking for a headset, great quality, fits comfortably on the ears, easy to adjust to fit your head, and you can use it for any console or  any electronic device",5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0

"Very uncomfortable to wear, I wouldn't want to use anything like this for very long at a time. Setup was easy and the sound was good, but it's all just too bulky for my smaller head. Sending back because the microphone is much too far away from the mouth and only moves up and down - the description claimed it was flexible, but it's not at all. I had to try and shift the entire headset to an angle to be heard properly over the mic, so that's a deal-breaker for me.",2,1,2017-11-5,1,2,0

Its got two different plugins in case the other doesn't work, it got an adapter to work with computer towers as well as more mobile devices, and the thing just looks cool. I have never used a 'noise-canceling' device before this so I can't say I have an amazing point of reference for its quality, but it seems good in the day I've used it. Most of all, however, this is an 80 dollar headset i managed to steal for 30 bucks, and I feel like I got away with highway robbery.

I’ll update it if there are any changes but it’s a disappointing purchase so far :(EDIT: The manufacturers/management reached out to me not once but twice to remedy my situation. They offered a refund or another set of headphones. I took the refund not wanting to take a chance on another set of headphones.

"I would say that these are definitely worth the price ($28 at the time) so long as the company hasn’t changed their building process since I originally bought them.That being said be aware that they don’t last particularly long, mine started having problems with the cord about 4 months in and mic problems within 6 months. I wouldn’t really call these noise cancelling either.

The second purchase in December 2019 lasted me only a few months before it actually had malfunction and stopped working the audio on the right side, but I had foolishly thrown away the warranty that had come with it. So that leads me to the third one I recently purchased (I continued using the broken one for a while) to finally be able to hear from both sides (for gaming).

The cord that comes with it is wrapped in a fabric and feels like it will hold up to a good amount of use. The cord is very long so it would also be good for someone with a PC. The only issue we have with the headset is that it has to be plugged into a powered USB for the lights to work. Not a big deal but, we just didn't think of that.

But if u have a bunch of piercings on your ears (I have 4. 3 lobe and one cartilage) then they are uncomfortable. I have had some headphones before that cover your entire ear, but these just go over the ears and can be uncomfortable. 4) when I was setting up the headphones to my computer, I looked at the instructions, but the sad part is that there aren’t many instructions in English. Most are in other languages and I was confused when I was given extra cords and didn’t know what to do with them. This product is nice, but I wish a few things were fixed.",3,1,2019-2-7,1,1,0
I love these headphones for the price the quality is pretty good. I use them when I play Call of Duty and I can hear EVERYTHING in the game. It has audio panning so that I can hear when there are people on the left or right of me when people are running in the game. The microphone is very clear and picks up sound from a distance.

Have the option to easily extend the headband. The over ear design offer great sound isolation, even with no active noise cancelling. The USB plug must be plugged into a power source to make the LED lights work of course, that is the USB plugs only purpose on this headset.

I have the old Xbox One and I already owned the necessary adaptor so I plugged them into that and they worked right away! The cord is pretty long so I keep most of it wrapped up a piece of velcro that was provided. The cord is also very sturdy (rope-like material) which feels good knowing it couldn't break easily.

I honestly didn’t expect them to reach out, but they asked what my address was and stated they wanted to make me a satisfied customer. Couldn’t of made me happier.So for my review...For $30, it’s the best set of headphones you can get at that price. I play PUBG, Apex, and COD. The sound quality is great for hearing footsteps and which direction shots are coming from. I would definitely recommend these headphones, especially now, knowing that they are a company that stands by their products.",5,1,2019-4-4,1,1,0

"I really like these headphones for playing games on my Nintendo Switch. It’s hard to find ones for that console. My sister said my voice sounds much clearer through these than on my apple earbuds i was using before. My only issue is that I don’t like the extra dangly USB portion because i don’t use it on a PC and you can’t really get rid of it. So if you hold your switch in your hands like I do, it might be dangling down. Hopefully this doesn’t wear down on the aux cord over time. Otherwise, the sound is good and the mic works good. Super comfy too!!",4,1,2020-8-27,1,0,1
"My son really liked this headset for gaming, although he found that ""plugging it into a usb to get lights"" wasn't worth it.It seems to be an ok headset for the price point, but you do get what you pay for.  The plug isn't the highest of qualities, and over a very short time, has bent so much that they are no longer usable.  Part of that is a learning curve for a 10-year-old boy, but part if it is the quality of the materials.",3,1,2019-3-22,1,2,0
For the price it is a great looking and feeling headset. It sounds clear. The issue I ran into is the mic is not working at times. The connection seems to be broken. I wrote them regarding a replacement which they stated they would send out. I have. Not yet received the replacement but I am confident it will come as they assured me via email it has shipped.*** UPDATE-  Product had to be replaced one time and the replacement broke already.  Not happy with this product.,1,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"I bought these specifically for gameplay with Warzone and they make a world of a difference coming from using the earpiece that comes with your PS4. I can hear enemy footsteps and I play much better now that I have the sounds of the game in my headset vs. through my TV. My husband has Turtlebeach headphones and these are very comparable to those but almost half the cost!Also, they are super comfortable!",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
My 10 year old loves it. My husband used to share his $200 headset with our son and he eventually broke it from being too rough. We decided to buy him his own. Great for the price and our son loves the look and the lights. No complaints yet about the sound. I assume it’s somewhat noise canceling because he can never hear us when we’re talking to him lol. He likes that you have to connect it to the controller since he would always forget to charge the last headset we had over night.,5,1,2019-1-21,1,1,0

"this is my second one, the other the cord that goes into the controller broke but this headset cost me at the time $30 and lasted 2 years so well worth the money, bought another, the price did go up by $20 but assuming with the years everything goes up. I used to use sony goldheadsets and wow those things used to break within months and way too expensive, highly recommend this one",5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
These things are super cheap. And when I say cheap I mean bad cheap! I was looking at all the other reviews and was surprised to see what people were saying. The quality of sound is horrible and it’s so muffled. The only good thing about them is the slight noise cancellation but other than that the sound quality is horrible. Also the product is made out of the cheapest plastic and all the instructions come in Chinese! Very disappointed.,1,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"For the price you can't beat this headphones, if they are to hold you down while you amass the money for more expensive ones, because you carelessly broke your really expensive set, or if your kid goes thru headphones like crazy. I highly recommend. Not noise cancelling, but comfy even if you wear glasses, Mic is ok. Happy with my purchases.EDIT: Sept. 30 2018",4,1,2018-4-13,1,2,0
"I am a mental health counselor providing online services.  I have been wearing these to reduce noise and to amplify the voices of my clients.  Background noises such as fans, my dogs, and ambient sounds are reduced or eliminated.  I am most impressed, however, with the comfort of these headphones.  They do not compress or irritate my ears.  I work 12 hour days, 4 days a week.  Also, they do not cause my ears to get hot or heated.  Other headphones did both and were uncomfortable for all day use.  These are WONDERFUL! I would definitely purchase them again (and in fact plan to buy a couple pairs for office, house, and backup).",5,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
"Great sound quality and excellent noise cancellation on the headset. The volume toggle on the cord is easy to manage. The optional USB light up feature is a fun addition.

"I bought this for my husband for Father's Day, back in July. It is now September and the microphone just quit working. After several troubleshooting techniques, we have found the cord has gone bad. After reading all the reviews, I am highly disappointed at the quality. Also I may add, I was also disappointed at the fact it ONLY lights up when using PC. I wish I would have done more research when purchasing, because that was my tie-breaker.",2,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
I bought this product for my son who utilizes them on his gaming console as well as to utilize on his computer/laptop.  He reports they  are working very well and the sound quality is fair.  He reports they are comfortable on his head and they adjust well.  My son did state he wishes the microphone was a little closer to his mouth; it sticks out a little to far.,4,1,2020-8-17,1,0,1
"The LED lighting is awesome, my boys love the blue light. These over ear headphones sit very comfortably and don’t make thier ears as tired as a lot of other headphones do. The sound quality is great.  The control knob for the volume is easy to find and use.  These also sit really well both of my boys heads for long periods of time (Call of Duty!!) g headphones/headsets. These headphons are a great value, very well made and  very durable.",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
I purchased this for my child and they like it a lot. They were using the small mic that came with their PS4 and it was constantly slipping out of their ear and their friends were having a hard time hearing them. These plug into their PS4 remote and now they can't hear us when we tell them to stop playing games...haha. It also lights up really cool and their friends hear them very clearly. Happy with my purchase.,5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
I bought this headset because I wanted to be able to talk to friends and play games during the pandemic. It is very good quality and feels solid. The lights looked too bright in the picture but they turned out to be perfect. The adapter is not included in the picture but it comes with it and looks great on the headset. I love the mixture of colors and overall I rate this a 5/5.,5,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0
The headset fits very comfortably on my head and I can have them on for hours and not feel uncomfortable like some other headset I have owned previously. The sound is really good and surprisingly you can really hear the base with this headset which you usually don't get as good quality of the base in other headsets. It is nice to have the option of lights on the headset with the USB although it can sometimes get in the way if the device doesn't have a USB but I can deal with that. Overall it is a really great headset.,5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
Company contacted me over a month after my last review about the set breaking within a month. They were very proactive to remedy the issue and offered to replace them with quick shipping. They delivered as promised and my son couldn’t be any happier. New set works well. We appreciate the excellent customer service and I would buy again. Thank you Bengoo! We appreciate it!!,5,1,2020-6-22,1,1,0

"So far so good! The plastic may be little cheap, and yet I've been quite impressed with the sound quality! It has great bass, and the microphone seems to work well too. They are comfortable to wear and they work great for my casual gaming! Definitely not for super picky/serious gamers, but very good quality for the price in my opinion.",5,1,2020-10-5,1,0,1
"My 4th grade son wanted this headset when he started online learning this year (schools are not open yet here). We wanted to get him something that was very comfortable, not too pricey, and we basically let him pick the style.  I was concerned that these would be too cheap but when they arrived we could tell that they were good quality.  He really likes that they keep most external sound out, loves the look of them, especially the lights on the external ear part that light up when plugged into a usb.  Haven't tried them for gaming yet but I'm sure they will fit the bill.  Overall a pretty solid product and great for the price.",5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"*UPDATE* Below is an honest and fair review. The seller tried to bribe me with $35 to delete my fairly negative review. I won’t delete it and am changing my review from 2 stars to 1 for the bad ethics of the seller. Below is my original review.They work. Don't get very loud and they are definitely not over ear headphones. I have smaller than average ears and they did not go over my ears, sat on them. My ears hurt after 10 minutes of using them but i have very sensitive ears. If that doesn't bother you they will likely work great. For me, I had to return them.",1,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"We have gone through two pairs of gaming headphones within months of each other. Both lost sound on one side of the headset. On one set the microphone piece kept falling off. Without it, my son's voice sounded muffled. Now that we bought this set, there is no pieces that can easily fall off and his voice is very clear to hear. We like that the microphone moves up and away while not in use. For the price, you wouldn't expect such great sound. The quality is perfect especially for the low cost. My son says that they are more comfortable the the previous brands we've bought. He also likes that they light up. Overall, great price for the quality that you receive. We'd definitely recommend.",5,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
"It's hard to believe you can get headphones this good for this price.  If you're looking into a gaming headset, this is a great entry point.  The sound quality is beefy, and the directional input is great.  Additionally, the volume and mix control is in easy reach. But they have to look good, too. Luckily, the blue LED effects really bump these up a notch.  A solid buy at a price that's hard to beat.  My only caveat is that the Mic arm only swivels up and down, so you'll need to pay attention to get proper positioning.",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,1
"Headphones have surprising good quality sound and outside sound is minimized greatly by about 75%.Headphones don't need the attached USB connection for sound, but the LED lights power up when it is connected. Useful to indicate when you are in teleconference.  Cable is about 6ft long with an inline volume switch and muting button.  Very useful to easily adjust volume or need to go silent.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"****UPDATE****. 7/19/2020-  about 3 days ago (7/16/20)  once plugged in to the controller, if you move or set the controller down it stops working... all cuts off- very disappointed...We had turtle beach 600. Had to take them Back to Walmart because they broke. Walmart did not have any that we could exchange it for. I was refunded and we went online and my son found these. He loves them! I was a bit hesitant about buying these because they weren’t wireless. However, even though they have a cord, the cord is extremely long! So far so good. I will update my review in 30 days and let y’all know how they last with a 10-year-old.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"I love these gaming headphones.  They are sturdy and yet light enough to wear for long periods of time.  The best thing about them is that they are affordable headphones that are compatible with Xbox, PS4, and other consoles.  They can also be directly connected to a desktop with an adapter that is included with the purchase.  I use them for gaming, but also for my job as an interpreter.  They are super versatile.The have nice LED lights on the sides.  The only design flaw I see is that they have two integrated connectors, a headphone jack that serves as both input and output sound, and an USB connector with the only purpose of activating the LED lights.  It seems like unnecessary hardware, but not a major inconvenience in the big scheme of things.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,1
"Headset has a long cord, which is great. The USB plug is only for the LED lights, so is definitely optional. Package includes a 3.5mm splitter for connecting to a PC (even though the picture says not included). That was a nice surprise.Sound is very good. Heard sounds in an online game that I had not noticed before. Mic is also very good. Have not tried Discord yet but the test recording was crystal clear.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,1

Plugged and played.  No worries.  Audio was better than my Sony music headphones.  Love this unit.  Perfect for Warcraft raids and Warship Clan Battles.  Noise cancelling helps with gaming concentration.  Strongly recommended for Zoom teleconferencing.  Keeps the echo and feedback to zero.  Same goes for monitoring your podcast studio.  Great balance of price and quality.  You will get your money's worth.,5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,1

These headphones are used for watching movies and shows on the laptop as well. On top of everything else the price point was great! It wouldn't break my heart and bank if my child break these. Everyone in the family are fighting over these headphones and don't want to use their earbuds anymore. I might have to get more in order to have peace in the house.",5,1,2020-10-5,1,0,0

When my son tried them on and played some games with it, he told me how clear the audio was and he was able to listen to everything that was going on inside his games. He is also using the headphones for his Zoom meetings and the headphones perform just as great as they do for gaming. However, my only concern for these headphones is that the USB interface for the LED lights is not compatible with my son's Macbook Air. If only there was a modification to the USB interface supported for Macbooks, then that will make my son have a better experience using the headphones with the LED lights on. It just gives the headphones a nice look to them while using them. Overall, a great product!",4,1,2020-10-4,1,0,0
I was looking for a headset to buy for my son for his virtual classes that had everything he needed included with noise cancellation. This was a suggestion on my Amazon search so I clicked it and loved everything it had. Ordered it on Monday and it came in yesterday. Let me just tell you guys these will not disappoint you or ur children etc. everything it offers you will not regret to buy. I had my son test it out to see about the noise canceling and he couldn’t hear anything. I tried it my self and let me tell you you can hear anything but what’s coming over the headset. Best by far will be buying another pair for my daughter.  MUST BUY!!!!My son loves them,5,1,2020-9-30,1,0,1

My son has complained about every headset he has tried to use on his XBOX One.  They don't work properly or his friends can't hear him when he is gaming.  I haven't received any complaints with this headset and that is a big plus!  I purchased the blue headset for his birthday and it has been working flawlessly.  It must cancel noise well because he can never hear us when we yell upstairs! :)  I recommend this headset.,5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
I bought this product for my 13 year old son who uses it for playing Xbox. This is the 2nd one we’ve purchased.

I have had many headsets in the past including hyperx, turtle beach, etc.  This headset is just as top notch in comparison and is very high quality in sound.

"My son really likes the headset. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the thing that we don't like is that it has to be plugged in in order to light up. The cord is so short he cant plug it directly into the PS4 or Xbox one. He has to get an extension cord and plug a charging block into it and plug the headset into that. I think the headset was made more for playing games on the computer because that way it can be easily plugged in since your sitting closer. Other than that it's a good headset for gaming, if you don't mind not having it plugged in to light up.",4,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"Purchased these earlier this week and tested them playing Destiny 2 on PS4. Sound quality is clear, and the mic holds up great. The construction of the headset is comfortable, in my opinion.

"Came across these headphones looking for some good cost-effective gaming headphones. Received them as a gift. Overall I am very happy with the purchase, and feel they are well worth the price! I use exclusively for PC, and they have very good sound quality (impressed with the bass), good ergonomic fit, and are reasonably good at noise cancelling.A small nit-picking thing, the separate headphone jack and USB for the lights stick out quite a ways, so they bump up where my mousepad usually sits, so having to get used to that. However, overall a very good headphone for the price! Would recommend.",4,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"My kids love them. They are well made, colorful, durable and have a very cool design. They love the way they light up. The options for all of the plugs are great.

"I didn't know what to expect getting this headset but I went based on the reviews of others and I am not disappointed so far. Just got them, so I can't speak for their longevity, but they appear high quality and are very comfortable. The fact that they light up is cool too but not practical for me. The connecting cord is super long and then down towards the bottom, it splits in two - one piece connects to your controller and the other is a USB connection to plug in if you want the headset to light up. The amount of cord length after the split is too short if you wanted the headset to light up as you play sitting/laying down many feet away. The light up feature wasn't a factor in my purchase though, so it's not a big deal to me.",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"It's been a year since I bought these headphones, and I don't have any complaints. they do what they're supposed to, which is, give me sound for my pc gaming and having a mic to talk to other people. The mic itself is not bad either, and it still works just fine after a year of use, the sound quality hasn't deteriorated from what I've noticed. I would totally recommend this as a very nice pair of cheap headphones for gaming if you are on a budget. The one thing I noticed is that, if you're a sound hoard, these probably won't do you much good. Now don't misunderstand me, the sound is actually still quite loud and it's still fine for gaming. However, if you are looking for a pair of headphones to blast your music at really loud levels like other headphones, that's probably not gonna be the case with these. The noise cancelling works just as intended too, and nothing has broken on my headset. These headphones are amazing if you're looking for something durable and good on your ears for long periods of gaming. I wouldn't recommend them for portable use (like walking around the city or anything else with a lot of movement) because they are pretty bulky and the chord is long of course. so It's a little inconvenient to try and do anything else but gaming if you ask me. Overall, I'd say the price is right on this pair of headphones, thumbs up.",4,1,2019-1-2,1,0,0

I purchased these for my work online as a para educator. I am working side-by-side with my loud children as they do their work too. These headphones have made it so much easier to stay focused on working online and hearing students. They don't pick up the background noise at my house and they cancel out the sounds so it makes it easier to focus. I've used them for music too and its amazing sound quality. My husband will use the for gaming once I am back to the school environment. They were a great price and worth every penny!,5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"The Headset is light, but made of awful cheap plastic and feels like it might last a week.I am a computer Tech. The Microphone does not work, period. It seems to be a common issue with Kotion Each Headsets. The headset refuses to use sound or microphone through the usb.",1,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
I am waiting to hear back from the seller. As of right now the mics on both headsets only work on occasion. They randomly stop working during the game. This is the first day we've had them and its only been about an hour.... I guess we will see what the seller has to say about two sets not working out of the box.,1,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"My son recently started back at school this past week. I return to work next week so he will be at his Aunts house doing online learning with two other kids in the room. He attends a different school so it will be a lot for Auntie. Her son already had headphones to make their Zoom meetings better. So I decided to look for some for my kiddo. These are stellar. He loves how comfortable they are, he loves that he can talk with the microphone and I love that I don't have to listen to 30 first graders at 8:00 in the morning... sorry lol. Thank you for an amazing product!",5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,1
"This headset is of good quality. The cord is sufficiently long. I purchased it to work from home and found it does not adjust small enough for me; therefore, I was not able to wear it comfortably for a full day. I will keep it as a backup headset or gift to my son for his gaming.",3,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"When I first opened the box containing my new headphones, I have to admit that I was skeptical of the quality of the item I purchased. While I think the design looks quite cool, I usually avoid purchasing tech that feels too light and plastic. Thankfully, I was doubting for nothing. The sound coming from my headset had a thick, full, and bass filled sound and the lightness of the headset was much appreciated after hour 3 of wearing them. Definitely a lot less strain than the Sony gaming headset I used to own. Hopefully, the materials of this product will last longer than my sony headset. All in all, at least right out of the box, I am definitely happy with my purchase!",5,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0
"I got these for myself because two of my mics up and broke on me, one seemingly for no reason as it was fairly new (and pretty expensive) but this mic is dang good for that price tag, it has good noise cancellation so I can focus on the game and good bass to let me enjoy the experience of the games I play, I like these a lot to be honest, the only bad things that I can say about them is that the wire is very long but can be adjusted with a Velcro strap and it can hurt my ears as I wear these for quite a while for gaming, if you are looking for cheaply prices headphones for quick sessions, good sound quality, and a good mic for communication, this will get you the most bang for your buck!",4,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"We just purchased this headset and we are very excited to use it. During these circumstances, it is difficult for our kids to play with others and gaming has opened more opportunities to communicate with friends and play freely online. These are very comfortable and the design is nice. Easy to adjust for varying head sizes. The LED lights only light up if you are very close to the console, but it is not a game changer. I don’t see the lights when wearing them anyway. I was concerned about no wireless option, but turns out that is not a game changer either. I like the option to mute and unmute from the easy accessible volume controls. We are very happy with this headset. Looks great too!",5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,1
"Pretty good headset. To be honest, I only bought it for the purple color and didn't expect much else for it. The instructions on making the microphone work on pc were a bit outdated and weren't something I could follow step by step. It took me a hot minute to figure it out myself with some guides online or Youtube. The quality itself when using the mic is alright. How it fits on my head is a little too big for me and doesn't fit my ears perfectly but way better than my old ones that were way too small for my ears. It is a massive upgrade from my old ones for sure, and all in all, it looks cool.",4,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"I bought this to take my French class and was impressed with the sound quality and it also worked really well with my Rosetta Stone programs, the system could understand every word I was saying. It was nice too because I usually leave the television running while doing other things and with the set on and learning French, I could not hear the television. Nice fit as well and the materials used seem pretty sturdy.",4,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0

"This the second one I ordered.  I gave my first one (the blue one ordered 2 years ago) to my son.  I originally ordered another Headset, but that one didn't meet my expectations, so I returned it and ordered one that I know will work.  Noise cancellation works great, my son can hear my voice with no background noise when we play games together.  The sound is crisp and the bass is at a good level. I have small ears so the ear muffs fits snugly around my ears. I've worn it for more than 5 hours and it doesn't hurt my ears. I would definitely order another one in the future when my other son can game with us.  Can we get a 3rd color?",5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,1
"I purchased the BENGOO G9000 blue light up stereo gaming headset for my 8YO son. He plays mostly on his tablet and our laptop. He loves it because it lights up and its appearance. Makes him feel like the YT gamers her lives to watch. My only disappointment is that one of the images says it does not come with the adapter, so I bought an adapter separately. But, the headset really does come with an adapter. On the positive side, the seller is very helpful. In the end, I’m very happy with the purchase of this product. I recommend it!",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"I picked these up as a gift for my little brother and we are both very happy with these headphones. I did a quality test before I gave them to him and I can happily say that these headphones are great for all your gaming needs. They are very comfortable with great sound quality and the additional plugins lets you use these headphones with just about every device you can think of. My little brother usually plays long gaming sessions and told me that he's felt no discomfort or irritation from wearing the headphones for such an extended period of time. All in all, my brother and I are greatly pleased and would recommend this product to anyone searching for affordable, stylish, and adaptable headphones!",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"We ordered this headset for my son's birthday. We wanted something on the cheaper side since it is his first headset, we did not want to buy anything overt he top in case he ruined them. These are perfect for him. The sound quality is good although it does seem to have a bit of an echo sound to it, but it does not bother him one bit. It is simple to use and the price was great. The padding on the ears and top of the headset make it comfortable to wear and does not hurt your ears after extended use  like so many headphone tend to do. We are quite happy with the purchase and would definitely buy it again., even over the expensive brands out there.",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"Amazing! Sound feels like Dolby 5.1, I use these all the time once I found your mic is separate from the speakers so u can cancel out your wife while banging beats as loud as you want while also hearing clearly what your friends are saying. Def worth buying! My only down side is noise cancel works so well I fins myself shouting at my buddies",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
My son got these gaming headphones a couple of years ago. Because of mishandling while packing for vacation he messed one of the ears up on it. He loved it so much he decided to get the SAME exact ones again. He loves them and I love I don’t have to hear all of his friends lol,5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"sound is great, love the color, but the lights stay on unless you unplug from computer. some may like that, I don't.

"Not was I was expecting! These are good headphones for the price! They work great on my PC ( USB light up!!) and on my PS4.

The blue light is super cool! The cord is also super nice and heavy-duty.",5,1,2020-8-30,1,0,1

"This was a great headset that works perfectly for my gaming needs.  The sounds quality is good and the microphone works great.  The headset has a control on it that allows you to increase/decrease both the game volume and chat volume at the same time.  I do wish they had the ability on the headset controls to change the game volume separately from the chat volume.  You can still do this within your gaming system, but it would be easier to control that from the headset.  The cord length is 6 ft, so there are no problems moving around with the headset.  It feels comfortable on your head.  For the great price I would recommend this headset!",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"My 11-year-old son decided on this headset after trying multiple others. This is the only one that he decided to keep, as the others had problems and were inferior.

He is happy to have finally found a headset that works so great.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0

Purchased this for our son to use on his Xbox Since it had a microphone for him to talk to his friend.  It doesn't work for Xbox system just letting you know. Then I was told we would get refunded from the company with an Amazon E gift card and that NEVER happened. So if your buying to use for a game system DO NOT purchase these.,1,1,2020-6-10,1,1,0
"I bought this headset for my son at his request. He loved the color, I loved the price and I ordered it for him. The shipping was fast. He said, ""the sound effects and clarity are great.""

"These are great for gaming or for school work. I mainly use them for gaming. However, the plastic is a little on the cheaper side, some times the mic won’t work or will make you seem super quiet. I like the fact that you can mute yourself and turn up the volume all on the headset. The usb is kind of annoying just dangling around, but overall this is a great product.",4,1,2020-9-29,1,0,0
"I was looking for a new headset for my PS4, I wanted something that wouldn’t make my ears hot, had quality sound, lightweight and would cancel out excess noise.

"I didn't even know there was supposed to be noise cancellation because I could hear my surroundings so easily. Also the ""soft comforting foam"" literally left 3 dents in my head because it gives so much resistance against my head. I get headaches every time I wear this piece of plastic. Sound quality is sub-par and you have to choose whether you want audio or your mic to work because instead of having to headphone jacks it has a USB xD Not a good buy, save some money and buy something from Logitech rather than buying this and having to re-buy a better headset later on because this thing leaves so many dents in your head smh.",1,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"This is a really good headset. I use it for working from home and it is very comfy and doesn't hurt my ears. I use this for about 6+ hrs straight. I thought because it was bulky it would weigh a lot and bother me over time, I was wrong! Sound quality is good, I hook it up to my work computer and it makes the sound so much better (my computer's sound quality on its own is horrible). It's good for zoom! I also tried it on phone calls and it works just fine. The only thing I would like to see maybe adjusted is to make the lights a bit bigger/take up more room, I was expecting there to be more brighter lights.",5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"This is a nice pair of headphones, and especially for the price! The only flaws I've had thus far are the top piece lengthening easily and the attachment that lets you change the volume and turn on/off the mouthpiece/mic is a little heavy.

At first, it would be really quiet for everyone i talked to even though I turned all the settings up.

"To be fair, you get what you pay for... I purchased this head set about 2 months ago to use on my PS4 and just recently the sound has started to cut in and out. When it worked, it was great and I felt good about having them but now I’m bummed. It looks like it’s a pain to return them for a refund so that’s also a bummer. Note to self, don’t buy any electronics with a brand name I’ve never heard of before. What’s more, I also always found it very odd that I needed to run an extension cord in order to get the lights to work. I suppose if I were using them for a computer it might make sense but not really for a console.",1,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0

They are lighter than they look so you hardly notice them on your head. I brought these to work and everyone wanted to try them out! Very pleased with my purchase. I'll definitely keep Bengoo in mind for any future purchases.",5,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"This was with almost daily extended usage for streaming purposes. Product only failed because of cord twining, PS4 controllers make most cords hang heavily because of where the actual entry point is located on the controller all PS4 users are most likely well aware of that...

I purchased this gaming headset for my 8 year old son to replace this aging headset I bought him when he was six.  He needed a new headset for gaming on his laptop and PS4.  It is pretty much plug and play for installation.  He said the sound quality is much better and comfortable compare to his old one.  He can wear if for hours without hurting his ears.  The microphone works well without any distortions to his voice.  We will wait and see how long it will last in the hands of an 8 year old.  I will be happy if we can use it for at least 2 years.,5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"Bought 1 for my son and 1 for my daughter.  They both are really into playing games and wanted gaming headsets.  Looked into AMAZON and found a perfect match with an affordable price.  Kids like the design.  Audio quality is better than OK.  Noise cancelling is not as perfect as BOSE of course but for this price, very great!  Above all, my son wanted a headset to play FORTNITE on NINTENDO and  this headset has a long enough cable to let him play it on a Big TV screen even when connect everything (TV set- NINTENDO Console- Headset) wired (see above photos).  Now he's a very happy camper!!",5,1,2020-9-25,1,0,1
"My son likes this cool-looking gaming headset with LED lights while playing his games on his IPad and computer. It is nicely made, mostly plastic and has a full round. While the headband is adjustable, it is more suitable for bigger kids and adults, as the headset is wider and feels heavy. Other nice features for me are that the microphone folds up when not in use and that it has a long braided cord with inline controls for the volume and microphone. I wear these for hours and don't have a problem. I would definitely recommend these or buy them again as a gift.",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,1
The headset is a great product for basic gaming and the ability to talk with members in the party. It worked without issue for several months. Then audio began to give feedback noises in the headset and the mic would cut in and out. Within a few weeks there was no audio and the mic stopped transmitting my voice communication. I contacted the company and they worked with me to replace the defective headset. Their customer service has been excellent and resolved my issues. They replaced it with the same model and it has been working as advertised.,4,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"It has great sound quality so I can hear everything that is going on in the game. It didn't work with Xbox but it worked for the PlayStation 4. With the split for the USB and the AUX, I wish the split was higher up on the cord so that there was more maneuverability if you were to want to have the lights on while you were playing. I also wish that the ear pieces were able to turn because I typically will only have one side over my ear so I can hear if someone is calling for me, and with them being a solid piece, it makes it uncomfortable to wear only one side. But, it is overall a great product and I am very happy with it, but we originally bought it for the Xbox but couldn't get it to work. Works perfect for the PlayStation 4 though.",4,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"Modifying my review because after a few days of use, these headphones are crap! Noise cancelling abilities are no different than a standard pair of headphones. The people on the other end hear lots of static and can barely us talking. While playing xbox live, people kept asking us to keep the mic muted because of the terrible noise. The lights must be plugged into a usb and with xbox one there really is no way to utilize the lights so they are pointless. This company is trying to up their reviews by offering incentives but never following through on them or making you complete a never ending process of steps to redeem your rewards for a great review. This headphones are not worth the money if you are using them for gaming.",1,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0

If you are looking for a great headset, you found it.",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"I took it apart one day and i found out that the cause of only 1 side working was because the dial was pushing on something on the circuit board which i am guessing messed up the small wires for the right side, causing right side not to make any sound, rarely neither of the sides will work. This happened after around 6 or 5 months give or take after buying this product, great for the short term problematic for the long term. also the sound is unbalanced, left is quieter than the right side. They contacted me quickly after i left the review And i am in the process of getting a refund. The headphones were very confortable i should of mentioned that, and i liked the lights. It would be a great product if the headphones didn't break like mentioned above.",4,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0

The kiddo reports that the headset is very comfortable, the sound is clear, and there's never an issue with folks on the other end hearing or understanding him. The one area where it falters a little is in the noise cancelling - he says that he's still able to hear his father down the hall when my husband is on a work call (I will admit, my husband is a bit of a loud talker on work conferences). Overall, money well spent for a product that performs as it was desired to.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0

"I originally gave this product 1 star. The mic didn't work out of the box. The seller reached out and sent a replacement. The mic worked on this one. It also came with a splitter that seemed to help with some of the background white noise I was experiencing. I waited to post the review to make sure the product didn't fail like some of the other reviews wrote- it is still going for me.If you an audiophile, the headset is bass heavy and shorts the treble- if you are a serious gamer, the mic works but isn't the most responsive. If you are an average Joe, budget conscious consumer, then this is a good product for the price. I would consider buying again since my kids are hard on my equipment so I want the decent price.",4,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0

Hello everyone headsets are pretty good not too bad considering the price.  I bought these for my son for his PS4  Please note  that they are more for PC.  When using them on pc u can connect to USB for lighting on headphones and MIC & Sound.  However if you are using on PS4 you need to connect the  Aux cable direct to controller therefore you can connect USB to ps4 for the lighting effect because the connection on the wire are all 1 wire. They should of done 2 wires coming from headset so that 1 wire goes to USB on ps4 and other wire goes to controller Aux. the way it is from the box my son would literally have to play attached to the ps4 since wire is about 3ft.  Other then that its a good product,2,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"Got these for our son to use with his PS4. Only negative is that there are 2 cords, one to plug into the PS4 and the other one has to go into a usb plug in the wall in order for them to light up.

"When these worked, the sound quality from the headphones and mic was just fine. However, these often would just not work. I tried every trouble shoot option on my computer as well as my boyfriend's desktop and neither of us could get them to work. I think they worked twice in the entire time I've owned them. I would just not bother with these because they seem very hit or miss. They seem great for some people and for other people, like me, they just stop working.",1,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0
"i mean, you get what you pay for. When I bought this it was around $25? For a pair of gaming headphones the quality matches the price. But even I thought 25 was too much for this. The sound quality is horrible (there was no sound 'depth', no bass at all), the mic kept emitting a weird static noise, and my head started hurting after wearing these for like an hour. If you want to use these for more than 30 minutes at a time, and you care about how things sound at a bare minimum, buy apple earbuds for the same cost, or spend more for an infinitely better experience. I bought hyperX headsets for 3x the cost and the quality of those are probably 50x these.2 stars because it's cheap.",2,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"I've been using this headset for about a week. It is comfortable and has a long cord. I dislike that there is a separate connection for the LEDs and wish that this was detachable by having an integrated port in the wire. I often feel irritated that there is an extra wire hanging there, but isn't really a big deal.The mic works, but isn't very sensitive and I feel as though I need to really speak up or turn my sensitivity on my system higher.",4,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
The one knock that I have it that you need to insert an usb to activate the lights on the headset... that doesn’t work well with PS4! I guess this is only for PC users for full capability. Other then that it seems to be affective... oh and the volume doesn’t get as loud as I would prefer.,4,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"As a gamer I would like to say,”Theses headphones are good.” I had headphones before theses and they weren’t as good as these ones. The headphones work great and my friends agree that they work better than the ones before. They fit perfectly and best of all they look cool. The noise cancellation is also good due to me being young there are many these going around in the background so I like to always keep a ear out to make sure I’m aware of stuff, but with these I don’t even need an ear out too make sure of stuff around me. If you play games that you need sounds to help then theses work great as good as some high brand headphones.",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,1
"IDK if it's my controller's fault, but I don't seem to have this issue with my cheap headset at all.I'm new to gaming, so I don't know if it's normal, but the sound quality is a little low. I think the noise cancellation does a pretty decent job though. I can't hear my husband when I'm playing. SCORE!",4,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"I use these headphones for movies or videos. I have not used these for gaming but I assume they will work just as great. The box included headphones, split pins for audio and microphone and manuals. The headphones have a 3.5 mm jack for audio and mic, also has a USB pin to light up the headphones (blue).There is no light on the mic itself but it does have lighting on the headphones - as shown in pics. Sits comfortable on the ears and don't hurt with prolonged usage. Headbands are adjustable and don't make a squeaky sound when in use. Earmuffs are soft and have memory foam in it.",5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,1
"The headset fit well, was comfortable, great sound, but the adjustable microphone piece broke on the first day of virtual school use. The surrounding plastic is broken in a way I can not repair.

I have tried this with x box and Nintendo switch. The audio is scratchy and blown out in switch and I can barely hear in x box.

"These have been perfect and definitely fairly priced. The only reason I’m giving 4 stars, rather than 5 is because you can’t remove the USB portion which is a bit annoying if you’re only needing it for a PS4 or Xbox controller. It just sits there and is a tiny bit bulky. Other than that, volume range and sound quality is great.",4,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"the Headphones are great I've been using them for 2 days straight. They work great. They could be considered awesome if they would allow a louder sound. I am partially deaf and have trouble hearing so I need the sound output to be a little louder for some sounds like explosions the sound it perfect to where the rest of the sound coming thru should be but even with it canceling out all the sound not coming thru the speakers it still feels like the max volume is around medium-high, like what a normal conversation with a friend sitting next to you and talking softly in and hushed room instead of you and a friend talking normal when they dont care for anyone walking by hears.my over all i give this set of headphones a 4.5 out of 5",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
Review after a few months:These have worked out great! We have three tween age cousins that all received a pair on their respective birthdays. The kids all loved them. They have held up great after a lot of use (often daily). We were really impressed. Highly recommend.,5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"A very good headset for its price. The sound quality, noise cancellation, volume adjuster are all great! The only problem I really have is it’s bulkiness and how light it is. The weight isn’t so bad because it’s always good to have a light headset, but sometimes it feels like if I accidentally drop it or something on it, it’s gonna break. The bulkiness of this headset isn’t much of a problem either. It’s just a little awkward to grab and sometimes gets in the way of a wired VR headset (if you are planning to play VR games with this headset on). But if you don’t have VR, it’s a pretty good buy.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
The sound quality is great and we love the fact that you can use it on both the xbox or pc. The problem comes from the poor quality control before shipping. When we received the product for my son's birthday he tried to use it for an online game on the xbox and his microphone wouldn't work. The microphone still doesn't work and we have no way of finding out if we're doing something wrong. There is no manual or troubleshooting link shipped with the product. My son is very upset about it due to the fact that he used his birthday money to buy the headset. So as far as gaming we rate it at a two star due to the lack of ability to be able to communicate with other players online.,2,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
I like that it works and matches my son's computer set up. It took a minute to turn up the speaker on the computer so other people could hear him speak but once we did it has worked perfectly. He has to move it off his ear sometimes to hear us if we try to talk to him so the noise cancellation is pretty good and the sound quality is very clear. We are happy with this purchase.,5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"I received this product when on sale for roughly $35, and for the price its amazing product, its lightweight but still seems sturdy. Sound is good for 40mm speakers. Got mostly to use for music and xbox one, and works good for both! It also has long cord length and has good connected volume controller and mute switch for mic. Has both 3.5mm and usb and was packed well.",4,1,2020-8-26,1,0,1
"I bought these after first trying Amazon basics gaming headset. I had to return the Amazon headset because of a short in the wire.

"My daughter loves these headphones. They are extremely comfortable to wear. The sound is awesome and mic works great as well. They make her feel like a ""real"" gamer in her words.

These are a great buy and I highly recommend them.",5,1,2020-9-7,1,0,1
"This headphone set is amazing for the price you pay. My 12 year old has been waiting very patiently for news ones after his old headphones have not been working. Tried them on myself and the noise canceling is great, the sound is nice and my son is happy. That's all that matters.",5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
My son could not wait to get this headset. It came a day early and he was ecstatic. The sound is fantastic and his friends say the audio is very good and no background noise. hence the noise cancellation is working. The blue glow matches his Laptop keyboard. ...,5,1,2020-9-5,1,0,1
This headset is perfect.  I ordered the Bengoo G9000 Headset to replace my cheap junk headset and enjoy gaming again. It exceeded my expectations.  The cord is flexible and long. The headset is comfortable even after hours of use. The noise cancellation greatly reduces background sounds. Forget paying 100$ for a great headset and grab this one.,5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"My grandson loves these to play Fortnite on his playstation 4! Easy to use, great light up feature is a bonus. He uses them for online distance learning too and it keeps him from disturbing his sister while she is in school! Great!",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"First off- I have never used headphones before, so I have no basis for any comparisons. That said, I am very pleased with my purchase.  Being able to tell which direction a sound is coming from is VERY helpful and I never realized headphones could do this for you. The quality of the sound is very crisp and clear and the mic seems to work well as everyone says they can hear me well. So, a solid purchase I'd say. Maybe someday I invest in an expensive set but I can't really imagine getting much more bang for your buck. Only complaint I have is that they become uncomfortable after a couple of hours and I wear glasses so that doesn't help with that I suppose.",4,1,2018-12-11,1,0,0
"Was in the market for a pair of noise-cancelling headphones that could also serve to have phone conversations with. These looked cool and thus far have worked great.

So far so good!",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"I bought these for my daughter's X-Box One game.  She was able to hear and be heard for the first hour of use, after that... she could hear, but NO ONE could hear her!  We did everything to try and fix.  Unplugged and reinserted - Nothing!  Changed batteries on the controller, used a different controller, went to settings and messed with that - Nothing!  She has not been able to use it since that first day.  I didn't even bother to return as it would cost more overall to do that...",1,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0

I finally decided to replace my old headset with this one and the sound quality is amazing. Things I didn't realize I couldn't hear before while I was gaming are now coming through clearly.

"Build quality looks like cheap plastic, and when it comes to actually wearing it you can tell it isn’t the best option for your money. I was also disappointed in the mic, it isn’t very good and will distort your voice to other people listening.",2,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0

"I bought this headset after another one i bought not 6 months ago died.  I  love the sound quality it provides.

"The sound quality of those headphones was incredible, I didn't expect much because I found a couple of headphones that I really liked and the sound quality was great, but they just blew me away when I tried them on. These headphones are lit, they 're so dope, and the LED lights are the best part and look amazing, but you can only connect the USB to light it up to a monitor or a laptop, you can also connect to a playstation or Xbox, but you'd have to be really close to the console. These headphones are very snug and completely cover my ears, and it just shows you how nice the headphones are. These headphones are really sturdy and bendable",5,1,2020-10-5,1,0,0
"I bought this for my Xbox 1S... yes I have a new Xbox and controller... and the microphone doesn’t work. I can hear everyone else but they can’t hear me.

Sound cuts out and there's an annoying popping. At first I thought it may be my controller but using a regular pair of earbuds I had no audio quality issues. Also not the most comfortable over ear headphones I've worn.Spend more and get a higher quality pair,1,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"The earphones are still pretty good. After all, high sound quality is not required at this price. The sound is still very accurate when playing games. There is no situation where the left and right ears have different sound levels. The microphone is also very clear and the sampling rate is very high. Gao later found that it was not bad after updating the driver. It may be that the brand is better, so the mouse and keyboard must be updated with specific drivers to be effective. So now it's pretty good and comfortable.",5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"My main issue is that my computer can't read this device. I was unable to connect the mic. So these pretty much ended up as headphones rather than a headset. Other than that, the sound quality is somewhat decent. It's no really noise cancelling. As for comfort, I'd say it's a bit loose for my liking. I don't want to be worrying about my headset staying in place while on crucial match. I think this product focuses more on aesthetic rather than quality. All the USB does is add lights the the headset, serving no other purpose at all.",2,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
Bought these for my sister because she was using earbuds for gaming. I wanted something a little bit better for her since my kids would disrupt her gameplay when we visited. We visit often.She said that she likes them and is glad just to have the ability to play music at a reasonable volume and hear her teammates in chat while she plays.,5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"I honestly expected this headset to sound like crap well because it q was as so cheap. When I opened the box they looked cheesy and what not but when I tested them out and amped up the volume they sound amazing!

"The headset, frankly, didn't work. It provided relatively high quality audio, however, the wiring made this audio constantly flicker and fail to work. But the microphone and communication was, to put it nicely, poor. The microphone rarely was able to pick up my voice (unless my mouth was less than an inch from the mic, which the design does not allow) and even when it did, my voice was quiet and distorted. Perhaps I received deficient version and it normally works perfectly, but considering the sheer quantity of reviews that voice similar concerns to mine, I doubt that.I will be returning it as fast as possible.",1,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
I just bought this headset for my son's birthday.  He absolutely loves it .  The sound quality is clear and the noise cancelling feature actually works.  The headset is great for all platforms thanks to the extra long cord.  Definitely would buy it again!!,5,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
I was looking for headsets to use for my xbox one because using regular headphones caused too much echo when I would join an xbox live party with my friends. This headset did not disappoint as there was no echo and I felt comfortable wearing these for a couple hours at a time without taking them off. The only thing I would say turned me off at first was that the plastic seems a little cheap and not durable but just take good care of them and you'll be fine. The lack of weight however makes the headset more lightweight and does not weigh me down or hurt the top of my head from extended use. Great buy and looking forward to getting a lot of use out of these!,5,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"I had a pair of these headphones for about 3 years until the chord broke around the audio jack and cut out half the audio. I thought they were a good deal for the price back then so I ordered another pair. The quality has gone down since. There is a loose, rattling sound in the left headphone that rolls around whenever I move my head. The volume dial has also been switched out to a lesser quality piece. The audio is decent and the muffs are reasonably comfortable, but my main gripe is still that rattling that makes them feel cheap.EDIT: Their customer service contacted me and is issuing a full refund for their defective product. They stand by their customer service.",5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"Its not a super expensive headset but its got amazing audio quality. Good directional sound for gaming, for music theres amazing bass that you just wouldnt get with the standard monitor/tv/phone speakers and jack doesnt slip out easily as Ive had that issue before with some cheaper headsets. The cord doesnt tangle up easily even if you wrap it up which is always a plus. Its got noticeable noise cancelling. You arent paying top dollar so its not going to block out everything but I think its worth what you paid for sure. Havent had any issues with the mic either. Overall great value headset and would totally recommend.",5,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
"I love this headset. Being able to communicate is important on any team play game, and these offer the best in communication.

The only issue I had was that the LEDs only work when the USB is connected. This is partially my fault for not reading the description enough.

When I called my husband via Google Hangouts it sounded even better than a phone call, he couldn't even hear the TV playing in the background, the mic only picked up my voice.

Also having the USB hook up just for the LEDs is a major flaw, if plugged into a controller it can snag on something because nowhere to plug it into.",4,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0

Anyway I changed my previous rating as the seller is really good with support and explained and offered me to return the item if it didn't meet my expectations.So, good seller responses and solutions but not the right product for me. Not sure why some want to have a usb connector just for the lights.",4,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"They are amazing. The quality of the sound really made me feel more immersed in my game. They block out all other sound so you really just hear what’s going on in the game. I have never been able to really pick out footsteps in Overwatch, but now I can. It’s great for gaming.They seem really big, but they are super comfy. They aren’t putting any strain on my head or neck. The comfort strip at the top is great too cause you aren’t getting any of that hard plastic cutting into your head.",5,1,2020-10-4,1,0,1

I received my package yesterday the driver dropped it off while it was raining and didn’t ring my doorbell so I didn’t know it was in the rain for a little bit.

"I purchased these  for my son for online school, and having only used cheap headsets and Apple wired earbuds, the sound quality was so good. I may need a pair for myself. I love that it has both the USB AND 3.5mm headjack and even came with a splitter. What a great deal! Shipping was quick and well packaged.",5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"The sound quality is above what I expected and works well with surround sound settings. The noise cancellation is perfect and fits comfortably over my ears. The design overall is sleek and futuristic, which I thoroughly enjoy, and the product is one that I would very well purchase again if/when I need another pair of headphones. In regards to the mic, it definitely isn't better than an individual mic, but that is the same as any other mic on headphones. However, compared to other headphone mics, I would say it works well and functions properly, which is certainly praise compared to much cheaper produced mics on other headsets. Thumbs up from me!",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
Quite possibly the cheapest sounding headset I've had the displeasure of owning. Right side of headset sounds so low you can barely hear anything coming out despite fully maxed volume on mic and pc at 100%.Left side was low but passable but only at 100% volume.,1,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
"Got these headphones for my son when I forgot to pack his up on vacation. He likes these ones sooo much better than his old pair. He likes how “they look like transformers.” I would say they are great at cancelling outside noise as he can’t hear me when he wears them, could be selective hearing too, haha but I don’t even get acknowledged. They are also very comfortable to wear and others can hear us talk to them just fine. The sound coming from the headphones is very clear. I would definitely buy for any gamers out there or even to listen to music.",5,1,2020-3-26,1,0,0

"The inline volume controls are great because my keyboard doesn't have volume control buttons and I always have to go through the control panel to adjust sound.  The USB is only there to power the LEDs in the headset, you can't use it as a USB audio device.  The headset opens real wide and has flex to it, so it doesn't feel like it will snap in half.  I haven't tried the mic in game yet, just played around in the sound control panel and can verify it works!",5,1,2020-9-13,1,0,1
"My first gaming headset, it did me a lot of justice for the past year and a half. However, I noticed the wire attached to the controller began to wear down. I have to hold it at a certain angle to hear and noise is only coming in from the left side. Really disappointing. The price has also gone up from when I originally bought it. Was hoping to buy again until I saw that. Otherwise, I'm sure with good care that your headphones will last as long as they did for me.UPDATE: The seller was very quick to respond to my feedback and sent me a replacement. Very nice company, with good customer support.",4,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
Switching to working from home requires pretty much the same accessories as gaming. These are sturdy and sit nicely on any size noggin.

I recommend this headset and whenever we are in need of another one, I will buy this same one.",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
I have been through many pairs of gaming headphones and these are by far the best ones yet! They work so good with noise cancellation. I use these to play on my iPad and also for gaming on my pc. I love the light up feature and you can hear sounds clear and loud. When I’m playing on Fortnite people say they can hear me really clear so i love the fact the mic actually works unlike other brands i have tried. I’m in love with these headphones already so if you are thinking about these go ahead and buy them now! You won’t regret it! I’m going to order another pair for my sister who is also a gamer.,5,1,2020-10-3,1,0,0

"So this product, I expected, for it to fit my head, as it seemed like an adult could fit these on their heads. If this company contacts me, asking me to delete the review in place of compensation I will not as I need to let it be known that the only way for these headphones to fit is for a child aged 7-9. They said this could fit an adult when it can't even fit me a 15-year-old. My ears became red after not even a minute of me using it. I am surprised by how many 5 stars this product has because it does not deserve it. Do not buy this product as it really will not fit your head unless you're a child.",1,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"No matter how loud I have the volume turned up, I can still hear noises around me.  I can hear the kids next door, I can hear a neighbor mowing their lawn, I can hear my dad's whistling.  Definitely not a headset I can use when I'm working at my desk.  Also, when the volume is turned up, the microphone picks up whatever is coming from the headphones.  I was in a chat with friends and we were hearing at echo and when we muted ourselves one by one, it turned out to be who was causing the echo.  I don't have any other microphones installed or plugged in.  Just this headset.",3,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
I purchased this headset for my 10yr old son who plays Fortnite. He was very happy to have them and says that he has no problem hearing his friends or them hearing him. He wasn't able to use the LED light feature on his Xbox One but he didn't care (I did but didn't press the issue). My main issue is that they only lasted about 6mos. Now I'm not sure if it's due to his 10yr old handling practices or product quality but they no longer work and now I'm stuck with the decision to buy a 2nd pair and hope for a longer life or consider other more expensive options. Friends are able to hear him but he can't hear them :(…,3,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0

"I connected to my ps4 and sounds terrible low and muted. The volume control is huge and has no indicators which way is up or down. Produces static too. Of course the lights  don't turn on  when connected to the ps4 because they made the usb too close to the audio jack. Even the stereo jack is bad, doesn't plug into my phone for example and not snug on the ps4 controller either. You can tell this is cheap Chinese made garbage. How this is an Amazon selection is beyond unbelievable.  This product is just bad all around.",1,1,2018-12-30,1,0,0

Don’t believe the reviews saying this isn’t for Xbox one. See my picture — I’m using it for XB1 right now. Sound quality is awesome and my voice is clear and loud according to my friends. All of that is 5 stars. The only 4 star aspect is the fact the  USB has to be plugged in to get LED lights. Nowhere for me to plug it so i miss out on that. Definitely worth the buy!!,4,1,2020-5-10,1,0,1

These work only for a few months. I ordered in December. My son is only allowed to play in the weekends. So now that he a out of school he's started to play more. Only you find out microphone is not working. We hit them less than six months ago but he only plays weekends SO it's used very little. Not cool to pay for something that only lasts a very few months. And Amazon tech support is no longer available. Not sure if they have a 1 ye guarantee..,1,1,2019-6-14,1,0,0
These headphones are great. They fit very well and have a good sound. I actually waited aboit two months tovwrite my review. After two months they are like new.Cable is long enough for large desks and far setups. My son loves them and uses them every day for school and gaming.,5,1,2020-10-5,1,0,1

They are in absolutely wonderful condition, sturdy/durable (which is great for a 10 year old), and have worked great for both gaming and distance learning.

"Does not work with Xbox One without the Turtle Beach adapter. At that price you might as well purchase the Turtle Beach headset. The cushions for your ears are extremely hard and hurt your head after several minutes of play time. You can only adjust the master volume, you cannot control game and mic volume individually.

They have really good sound quality and are very comfortable to wear. The only issue I have is when I keep them on for long gaming periods and the tips of my ears start to hurt a little bit, but that happens with most of these kinds of headsets for me, but usually much worse. So I'm glad to have foynd a headset that reduces that, at least. I'm also very glad that the USB only powers the LEDs. Used to have a Turtle Beach headset back on Xbox 360 that required the USB to power the whole thing and it was a pain to deal with at times.",5,1,2019-4-7,1,0,0

Every so often I’ll take them off and wipe off the area around my ears. Other than sweat the only other issue is distance from mic to mouth requires you to speak up a little bit.

The overall quality is not that great and this item does come from China. Bad thing is that you will not get a replacement but you’ll get a refund if they can’t fix it. I would not purchase.,1,1,2019-8-8,1,0,0
"The headphones are comfortable for long periods, the clarity is great, and microphone is nice and clear as well. Noise cancellation is good as well given the price. You can't really go wrong with this one. Even works well for softphone calls if you do that.",5,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0

"Bought these for my fortnite loving tween boys. Perfect fit and they’ll be able to grow with the headset. Works great for their distance learning school as well. We use them with chromebooks, switch and PS4. Definitely recommend!",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
My son really likes using these for virtual 2nd grade. He hears a lot better now that he has these. They fit over the ear and keep a lot of unnecessary noise out. They are comfortable and he loves the blue light.,5,1,2020-10-3,1,0,0
Got the product and upon attempting to hook it to my computer found no way of actually being able to use it despite hooking the dual 3.5mm up to my PC. What's more the audio jack doesn't work with my phone or my laptop. A lovely looking paperweight.Edit: months later I am still getting begged to take down this review by the manufacturers. I told them stop harassing me or I’ll let everyone know what they’re doing. So now I am. They will beg and plead and send you waves of emails to take negative reviews down so no one knows how bad their stuff is.,1,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0

"This is the headset my son picked out for his 14th birthday. This is the best headset he's ever owned. The sound quality is amazing, there's no static and they're super comfortable.  Highly recommend for gamer guys and girls.",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
Okay so I do not dislike this product in fact it worked really well for me no problems at all I enjoyed it. But if you if you are looking for casual gaming every now and then these are the headphones for you and for around $20 it’s not a bad deal with other headphones you need an adapter or something like that with this one you don’t really need that over all 4/5 mines lasted a lot long then I thought they would.,4,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
"Overall a good headset that will satisfy most people looking for a new pair. The sound quality is about the best you can get for the price, and the headset itself is lightweight and doesn't cause any strain. For someone like me who get's headaches from tension from other headsets/headwear, this pair is great for me because it rests comfortably on the head and doesn't squeeze. The only issue that some might find is that the noise cancellation is subpar.To conclude, this headset is a great buy if you are looking for good quality for a decent price.",4,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"I really really love this headset!! At first I thought it was mainly for PC but I was wrong! It works just as great for the ps4 and xbox! One tiny down side is that I was expecting the mic that is on the headset to turn off when you put it back up, but it doesn’t do that, but it’s no hassle at all! I also love that it lights up and it looks so cool! I really wanted to take my time with testing out this headset and I purchased it almost a month ago or more and I would like to say that I would recommend this to anyone who doesn’t have enough money to buy the high end headsets, it works just as good as the high end ones!",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0

The sound was popping and cutting in and out of the right earphone and if I moved my head at all the sound cut out completely. I returned them for a refund.  I would guess I just got unlucky.I have to admit these headphones have exceeded expectations. For the price I didn't have much faith, but they are comfortable, the sound is good also.

Working from home and doing a lot of remote live interactive meetings/training people; I needed a headset with mic.  This headset works perfectly and was reasonably priced.  It is comfortable and the audio is excellent at both ends.  I love it !!!,5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"This is an utter garbage headset. The adapter that comes with the headset doesnt work for the microphone. It can get shoddy sounds through but wont detect any input. If you take away the adapter and plug it directly in to the input it activates the microphone but then you have no sound. This is a total waste of money. The audio quality was quiet with no real clarity. And the noise cancellation is a joke. Im pretty sure when they reference noise cancellation they mean with what ever you say through the microphone, nothing is getting through that piece of garbage.",1,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
The headset speaker is a little bit far away from my mouth so I need to speak loud to make your voice heard while chatting with your friends online. But overall its a good product for the price and there is no issue with the headphones' sounds. The headset cover is big enough to cover my ears and the customer service is excellent! Hopefully they could change the speaker stick more closer to the mouth in the future.,5,1,2017-12-28,1,1,0
"A heavy, solid piece of gaming equipment, for sure. It is heavy and probably not the best for those with any posture of neck/head issues. It cancels out OKAY, though a bit much? Sound is more quiet than usual coming in from say, a game or Youtube? I have to turn things way up to hear. It's not a bad headset, just bulky for ME. Cancels out in coming noise too much for me to get used to.",4,1,2019-1-3,1,0,0
"My son loves this headset! Although I have not used them, I'm pretty confident they have great noise cancelling as he never answers even if I'm right behind him, (or maybe he's just ignoring me), The lights are pretty cool too, no sneaking on with the headsets at night, he lights up like a Christmas tree..lol",5,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
Im a big guy and these are hanging off my head in any configuration I try. They do nothing for noise cancelling because the ear cups dont actually close over your ears and seal to the sides of your head.

These headphones were awesome! My son loved the lighting feature and the adjustable mic.  Great value for the price. Customer service is everything. The seller is the main reason id definitely buy my next set from bengoo. Their service and product was impeccable!,5,1,2020-6-17,1,0,1

"Not bad for a budget headset. Sucks that you have you plug in USB to have it light up, but it could be worse.  Can't see the lights when you're wearing them anyway. It gets pretty warm wearing these because they cut of airflow to your ears. The mic boom has gotten loose so now it kinda hangs a bit. That's a little upsetting. I'm happy with my purchase.",5,1,2019-7-25,1,0,0
"The sound quality is perfect, and the microhpone is perfect for gaming!  My friends can hear me very clearly, but my only complaint is that the nooise cancelation isn't the best.  Other than that, this headset is great for the price!  Would definitely recommend to others!EDIT: poor customer service.  I sent an email back in April whn I wrote this review and still never received a response.  If you hhave problems with this headset, good luck getting any help from the company.",2,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"Gets the job done. My kids like it so they can play with their friends on Xbox, but it doesn’t work with one of our controllers for the Xbox one s.

"This is our 2nd pair, both with the same failure in the inline volume control. The first time we assumed it was overuse by our kids. The second time, we didn’t even use them a month, strictly for school. The wheel on the inline is clearly defective. The slightest pressure causes the sound to cut out. Now they’re junk. Completely useless, and need to be replaced again.",1,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0

The noise cancelation is really good! I can barely hear any outside noise. I love the light it emits and the sound quality is very good!

My Kid Fully Recomend it!!!!!",5,1,2019-1-5,1,0,0
I bought two sets of these headphones for my two boys to play on Xbox one live. My boys have fallen in love with them. They wear nicely and fit well.

They are perfect for any preteen/teenager/young adult gamers.,5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0

"I play on my Xbox One and it comes with extra aux plugs, but it already fits my controller so I was very happy about that. It does have amazing sound cancellation, as my music was playing and I couldn’t hear it through them. The sound quality isn’t bad. It’s not very loud, but you can still hear everything. I am not a professional gamer, so these are just perfect for me.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"These headphones are very very amazing, but it doesn’t come with an adapter for using the microphone and the audio at the same time, which makes the microphone part a waste unless you have an adapter already, or are willing to spend an extra 10 dollars to buy one. The sound quality is top notch, and it has a perfect comfort level, but I would really like to have that adapter come with it. Since it doesn’t, I feel like it just barely isn’t worth the 40 dollars. Great all around though.",4,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0

this headphone with mic is better than the one I bought from my local Best B store at nearly twice the cost.  It is able to connect to a USB and to a headphone jack.  Love it the mute button and looks great too,5,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0

"The headphones are great!!! They’re a perfect for gaming! They’re perfect for little kids! The volume is not so high, you can hear people perfectly, would definitely buy again for little ones(: now if it’s for adults, this headset is not for you.  The volume is not loud enough for adults, you don’t hear the action in the game.. if you’re talking to people over the headset!  You hear the people more, than the gunshots and steps in your game on Xbox. This headset is mainly for computers, do not buy if you’re wanting to use it for the Xbox or something else.  It will only work very well on computers!",5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0

I got the Bengo G9000 for my 13 year old who absolutely loves the headset.  I can personally attest the headset noise cancellation works because I often have to go and tap him in order to get his attention when he is gaming.  I definitely recommend this headset for anyone who is into gaming.,5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0

"Bought these as a gift for my boyfriend since he was always complaining about his other headsets not working. Despite the price, these are actually pretty good and the sound quality is great.

It also light up only if connected to the usb not the controller, so forget about the light.",2,1,2018-8-7,1,0,0
"I came in expecting the headset to be cheap, low quality, and really fragile. Luckily I was wrong. I came from the Logitech G230 and was it a big upgrade.

using for pc gaming don't like the fact the mic is kind of far away to me and can only be moved up and down. also if you don't use the usb it just hangs there flopping around and is something to get pulled on. they also give you a free product if you review so no wonder they have so many reviews 😂,5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,1
"If you're looking for an affordable ps4 mic this could definitely be up your alley. It's not a bother to wear for extended periods, has good quality sound, and the mic picks up your voice clear and cleanly.Only downsides I've noticed are that the mic will occasionally light up in chat as active while muted, and that the padding offers essentially no noise cancelation (can very much hear a conversation in the next couple rooms over) but nearby people can't hear what you're listening to so ya know, pick your battles.",5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0

"Although this headset will most likely work, if you purchased this headset (like me) for the added effect of the LED light, DO NOT PURCHASE. What the description fails to mention is that in order for the LED to light up, it must be connect to a USB port. Also, the cord length from the headset jack which is plugged into your controller, to a USB port (most likely from a computer) is less than 12 inches. Meaning if you want to both use the headset and have the LED light, you'd have to basically play with your laptop on your lap, and your computer inches away. Also, you apparently are unable to return said headset, so now I'm out $22",1,1,2019-3-27,1,0,0

Great entry level headphones for your PC. I just finished dropping a ton of money on building my PC and the last thing I wanted to do was drop a ton more on peripherals. I'll have these for a good while and even if I upgrade later they'll turn into a travel pair for my laptop. I'm not an audiophile so I'm not going to pretend to compare them to other headphones but I know for a fact they beat my monitors built in speakers lolPros:,5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"I bought these for my six year old son for PS4.  Overall, I would say he is very pleased with them. He was excited and thought they looked cool.  I tested them out, sound quality is good and they work fine.Only negative is the cord is way too long and has a dual end with a USB adapter.  I guess for PC gaming it’s fine, but for consoles it feels kind of clunky.  Plus you have this needless USB adapter just flopping around. There is a Velcro tie attached to the cord. It’s not very effective for securing the USB portion though. I’m tempted to just cut it off.  Other than that, it’s not bad for the price.",5,1,2019-3-10,1,0,0

The earpiece is very comfortable, it feels like you are wearing ear muffs and it definitely cancels all sound while you are playing.

I bought these headphones as a quick fix when I needed them, knowing I don't have a hundred dollars to just throw away. This was a great solution and not a waste of my money. I was surprised to see how comfy they were with my glasses, as most usually hurt my ear or my head or position them weirdly. I was very pleased with that. The soft cushion was also really surprising. Probably the most comfortable headphones I've had yet.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"Nice working headphones being used on Xbox 1. Volume is adjustable and mute is nice. If I plug the USB of the headphones into the Xbox they light up Blue just like in the picture. Only thing I would change: If these are going to be marketed as Console Compatible headphones change the cord up. I cannot plug the USB into the Xbox and plug the jack into the controller unless I sit 6"" from the TV without the use of a USB extension cord. The jack and the USB are split within 6""-8"" then the cord is molded together",4,1,2018-3-28,1,0,0
"I originally purchased this product some time ago and was unhappy with the quality of the product. Originally I had provided a 1 star review as I was unhappy with quality/performance and companies willingness to provide a refund or allow me to return product (was unable to get a hold of them) Since then, the company has actually contacted me and advised me they have changed to a better manufacturer and were very sorry for what had happened. Overall, although I have not tested the new product they offer I can say the company has gone out of their way to make this right and has provided a full refund for the product in which I had received even though I had gotten rid of the previously purchased headset. In short give the product a try! Hopefully it is improved in workmanship and for the cost it’s worth a shot!",5,1,2019-2-6,1,0,0
"I was in need of a mic since my old one had been broken. I looked on amazon and saw this. It was a mid-price and I bought it for a temporary mic.It does not have a sound cancelation, but a very nice fit for a larger head. The mic quality is good, and the thing has a pretty nice sound for mid-tier gaming headsets.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"Bought 2 of these. Both worked fine, but the mic stopped working on one of them. The seller was amazing and immediately shipped a new one to us. I highly recommend this company. The customer service couldn't have been better. The quality, sound, and noise cancellation on these headphones are great. I highly recommend them. My husband and son use them daily in fortnite.",5,1,2018-12-6,1,0,0

comfortable although the thick padding can make your ears a little sweaty(may be a personal issue) with great audio and while it worked the mic worked well. unfortunately after about a year the mic no longer works. I looked through other reviews and this seems to be a common problem as early as one month. so buyer beware if the mic is important this may not be the device for you.,3,1,2019-4-3,1,0,0
"You get what you pay for. Sound quality was pretty poor and after several days of using, the highs started to cutting in and out. Sent back to Amamzon.

"I love these.  I don't use them for gaming, but online learning.  The sound is awesome and so is the mic.  I tend to speak very softly.  This headset amplifies my voice and enables my teachers to hear me loud and clear.  My only complaint is the ear muffs are a bit uncomfortable after a couple of hours.  So, I cannot keep them on the whole school day.",4,1,2020-8-20,1,1,0

I can hear the sound of food steps on call of duty, much better than my old one $50.When i put it on, the sound of my neighbor’s grass cutting machine is gone, not completely but acceptable, thanks god i really hate that sound. It’s fine if you use it to play games, my friends can hear me when i use the mic, but i don’t know how they actually feel about the sound from me lol.

Both my kids like how these fit and sound.  It took some time to get used to the variety of cords.  They are larger than I anticipated; but it is more padding than I expected also - so I'll call that a win!!,5,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
My son loves these.  Before he was trying to play just using the volume on the tv or a regular pair of earbuds.  He said when he first started using them he thought the footsteps he was hearing in the game were that of someone coming after him when in fact they were his character's.  Have only had for 3 days.  Hope they remain this way and last a long time!,5,1,2018-12-26,1,0,0
"This headset is very nice. it has style, good quality, and is very comfortable. I really think the lights look good, and it definitely gets me submersed in the game. Overall, everything about it is great, but since I'm small, it keeps sliding off my head once in a while. I've seen other people comment on how the mic is too far from the mouth, but i think that as long as you speak loud enough people would hear you. Sure hearing loss may occur, but as long as you are careful, the sound quality is good enough that you don't have to set the volume very high. A solid 4 star product",4,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
This kids absolutely love their headsets.  We buy them so many headsets through out the year. Many $10-$20 headsets because the kids destroy them so easily just by lounging around playing on thier electronics.  This year I decided to try this pair based off the reviews and the fact that they are wired and have LED lights.  The kids and I are pleased with this purchase.  2 weeks after receiving them and the kids are still using them so that's a good sign.,5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,1
"The mic worked really well for the first few months I had it, and for the price it was hard to beat. However, not too long after owning it, the mic started cutting in and out. Now whenever I play, it constantly pops or fizzles and annoys everyone I'm playing with, or it just won't work and I have to rotate the cord in the controller until it actually picks up again. I read reviews of good customer service, but after emailing the company and failing to hear back after several weeks I'd have to disagree. I'm here on Amazon today to actually buy another mic since this one has just gotten worse and worse.",3,1,2018-11-13,1,0,0
"Although the headphones did not include instructions, use was fairly straightforward.  It took my 10 year old 5 minutes to figure out how to get the lights on & they've been functioning fine since purchase.  The mic is very clear, sound quality is great (good for hearing enemies in Fortnite), and they're very comfortable for him to wear.  If he could change anything about the product, he said he'd make the usb cord for the lights a bit longer.  One month in use and they seem to be quality and hopefully will last a long time.",5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"Not sure why I have such issues, 1st time worked great for a couple of months and then nothing. Tried them again cause it was a great price, saved for gift and didn't even work out of the box.  Amazon was great with the issues, but never any response from brand owner.",1,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"A nice all around bargain headset with a high end look. Would've been nice to have the mute toggle be the actual mouth peice itself. The mute is a switch on the cord which is sometimes hard to get to quick enough (to hide rage moments lol) or tell if it is actually muted or not. But due to the price, Thomas griped is very easy to overlook.",4,1,2019-4-15,1,0,0
"My son says these headphones are very comfortable. He uses them with the PS4, The Nintendo Switch and his cellphone. He is very happy that he got these headphones. Said the quality is great and the only thing he wishes was  different is that the microphone could move in closer to his mouth but I’m sure whoever is on the other side of the microphone is grateful there is some distance because he is constantly yelling out while playing!",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,1
I bought these for my fiancé for Christmas he liked them a lot but they didn’t last long up against him being rough with the controller when they were plugged in which broke the AUX piece. 🙄 they worked amazing up until then and they looked really nice! He liked him a lot too.,5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"Really good value!  Love that the sound from the game will come through the headphones, so you can turn the TV all the way down as to not disturb others.  It was really cheap and a great replacement for the standard XBOX headphones.The cord from the headset to the controller is a bit long though and it's a heavy assembly all together.",5,1,2019-2-16,1,0,0
"I have used many different headset products over the years.  While this is not the best as this is a lower priced product, the quality of sound is pretty decent.  The bass is not as heavy as I personally like, but i've only gotten deep bass out of much more expensive headphones.  These are pretty light and comfortable especially with the thick padding on top.  The ear pieces are also pretty comfortable, though they could do to be a bit bigger.  If you have large ears you may have to look elsewhere.  Other wise, these work pretty well.",5,1,2020-9-29,1,0,0
Got these for my husband and he loves them. Uses them for gaming with the kids and listening to music. The only downfall is he can't hear me because of noise cancelation lol. I would recommend this product to anyone.,5,1,2020-10-5,1,0,1

"Bought these for Christmas, and the giftees like them better than the current logitech ones they have (maybe the new, LED ""hotness""?) Cant hear any ting or pop, and gets plenty loud, surround sound. While powered, you cant hear anything but what you're supposed  to.Mute switch is nice, or turn off mic in PC settings. Mic provides good audio to squad/party, and boom is away from face, (easy to snack). I bought the blue, and red. The LED is bright, and stylishly match LED mouse/keyboard, (if that's what you're into). Price may have you thinking these are less than what you know work, but give it a shot, for at least a backup set, you might just change to these. What you see on site is what you get, and the description is accurate. Would buy these again to use or as gift.",5,1,2019-1-8,1,0,0
I use these to teach English online. They are excellent. The microphone doesn't move close to your mouth but they do pick up everything you say without grabbing too much background noise.

Terrible design. You need an additional audio extension cord. The audio cord is 2 feet long and comes off the insert line which goes into the PlayStation 4. You can’t move away from the PS4. This is meant to be for a PC. Buyer beware,1,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"Was a great product for about 9 months, headphone jack broke in half, while i was on a call, had to pick the end out of my phone with a needle. Great for noise cancellation, gaming was okay, sound quality needed to be tweaked when i first plugged in. overall great product except for the longevity. Not buying same product again. will look somewhere else.",2,1,2019-1-10,1,0,0

"This is a very good gaming headset it also came a couple of days earlier which is an A+ for me. The sound is good you can hear the bass and details of it, it’s comfortable if you wear glasses, it does a good job reducing noise around you unless someone is talking really loud. The only downside I would say is the USB for the LED lights, if you’re playing on consoles you have to connect it to your system for the lights and plug in the headphones to your controller forcing you to be right next to your system if you want the lights to be on but I don’t mind. Overall it’s a great gaming headset",5,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0

"this headset has lasted for about 7 months, and I have already had jack and mic problems. I had to turn my mic all the way down, or it sounded like I was shouting at people, and was picking up lots of background noise. Now to the jack. This is what scares me about all wired gaming headsets. The cord is great! It is thick and strong. However, I have had problems with the jack where it won't pick up game sound, or it will but the right ear will be considerably less loud or just not present at all. The way I fixed it was I rubbed the jack with my fingers all around it, and then blew into the 3.5 m hole in my xbox 1S controller. It worked perfectly for 2 weeks, then I had to do it again. Since then, I haven't had any problems. I would recommend the Razor Kracken Pro v2 which is only 55 bucks and is really nice.",3,1,2019-2-20,1,0,0
"I purchased this headset for my kid to use on PS4, laptop and iPAD. As said in the description this is a multi platform compact able device and works perfect. It has cool LCD displays. Kids will love it. Very good noice cancellation, good sound, amazing controls and super easy to setup. With all pros, the only cons is the mute button didn’t work only on an iPhone.Otherwise it’s a best headphone for a Gaming Set.",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"The overall sound is not too bad. They are fairly comfortable to wear for longer periods of time too as I have never had any issues with comfort. If you want to use this on Xbox Live to talk to friends and other people you're playing online with, BUY SOMETHING ELSE. The amount of sound that leaks out of the ear cups is ridiculous. And the microphone is way too sensitive. Even playing on low volume in the headphones, my friends always hear the game sounds through my mic and hear every click and button press of my controller. If you want to buy these to play single player games then go for it, but do not use this for anything online if you plan to play with other people or talk with friends. Not very happy with these overall.",2,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0
Got them today! They are very nice looking! Time will tell if they hold up but for the price we are very satisfied. Updated my daughter gives them a 3 for overall quality. She says the sound is poor: 3rd update she’s has been using them 24hrs now and loves them! 5 ⭐️!,5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,1

"I really like these headsets and typically lean towards them when buying a headset. The light up feature is neat and they are great for noise cancellation. I only have two issues and I never had this issue with the other pair I had bought. The ear covers are a bit small and hurt my ears with prolonged use and the mic on this one is not flexible so I cant move it closer to my mouth. Of course I fix thag by just speaking a bit louder.

It works well it's a bit on the heavy side of headsets. The cord is heavy as well. To make the headset light up you need a USB source it is not necessary for use though. Volume is solid. Microphone is ok but offers no flexibility and only moves up and down,4,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
The headphones are a joke they constantly cut out and have the headphone stop working after 2 weeks. They even offered a replacement set that also does not work. They send out faulty products that stop working after a short period of time. 0/2 headsets lasted more than two weeks. I have also updated this review because the company has emailed me every 2 weeks begging me to delete the review. I refuse to because I do not want others to go through what I have gone through. Better off sticking to the name brands like turtle beach so you do not have to deal with faulty products and a barrage of emails.,1,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0

Everyone I talk to exclaims how much better they can hear me with this new mic. I'm a soft-spoken individual so any static can drown me out - which was the issue before. This particular headset is crystal clear though. It's also pretty fancy looking.The only downside is watching movies in the dark is slightly harder as the glow form the headset is actually bright enough to light up everything in my peripheral vision to a fairly distracting level. It's like having a blue cellphone light on each side of my head.,5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0

"I was a little worried with the price being so low that the product would feel cheap or have poor sound quality, but this headset is sturdy and lightweight, and sounds amazing. The built in mic works great, and any headphone jack with built in mic functionality (laptop, ps4 controller, phone, etc) is compatible. The volume control and mute switch are sturdy as well, and I don't feel like I'll accidentally break them being too rough like I have with others in the past. The aux cable connection is reinforced and would be very difficult to cut without a deliberate attempt, so it seems like it will last for a long time.It's possible to get a great quality product without paying a hundred dollars, and I recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a casual headset for online gaming. 5/5",5,1,2018-3-2,1,1,0

"This is my third set of PC headphones in as many years. First, came the Corsair Vengeance 2100 Wireless Dolby 7.1 Gaming Headset. It wins, hands down, for design and ergonomics. It's actually more comfortable to have these headphones on than to take them off. Unfortunately, the batter life was terrible, so I typically kept them plugged in all the time. And the cable was pretty short, so I had even LESS freedom of movement than I would with most other headsets. They finally died after about 18 months.Next came the UL SADES SA901 7.1 Surround Stereo Pro USB Gaming Headset.

Ordering was quick and easy. Headset arrived in 2 days so nice and quick. Work as expected. However my son was disappointed that LED lighting only works by USB being plugged in since using with his XBOX controller = not really an option. Overall good headset for price,4,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"Amazing headset. It's an inexpensive headset, works perfectly on xbox and playstation. Wish they made separate sets without the PC cords. Buts it's a good headset, sound quality is fine, remember your not paying $100, but for a cheap headset it works.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"alright so the mic arrived today and from one day of using I noticed a HUGE difference from the older one I had! This one had such good noise cancellation and sound quality. This also fits perfect on my head with full comfort. If you are looking for a good mic this is the go to one you should go for. Also one more thing, I had the older generation one and it lasted for 2 year! So I definitely recommend buying from bengoo! They have such good quality products ITS AMAZING!",5,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"This was a ""shot in the dark"" xmas gift. My son wanted the super expensive xbox headphones and I couldn't afford them. I ordered these. He LOVED the color and he says the sound and quality of the headphones are better than the official xbox ones! Mom for the win!",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"This works great with my XBOX One and very simple to hook up. There are a couple of downsides with this product. Although you get the surround sound feel, you don't have the ability to control the sound. Even though you can turn up and down the sound on the headset when directly connected to the controller, but even at the maximum sound the sound was not that high. So even if you just bought this headset and you want more sound, you will have to buy the Xbox One stereo headset adapter. This allowed the sound to get much higher and i could control it with the adapter sound. For the money this is a super good deal but i would recommend you buy it with the adapter for BEST sound experience.",4,1,2018-1-14,1,7,0
"My son is a intermediate to advanced gamer. He used these headphones and also has them as a backup just incase friends come over to play.  The sound quality is good but could be better. The bass does not sound amplified. They cancel out some sound but not everything.  Mic picks up movements among talking. Also he would of liked if the volume control button was smaller. Other than that these headphones are well packaged. They have a nice braided cord. They come with multiple adapters. They are padded, lightweight, durable and have a cool blue light. For the price point they are not bad.  Great for the beginning gamer ages 7-13.",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
The gaming headset is great for kids for school work and listening to tutorials. My son is thoroughly enjoying his learning by listening through these new headsets of his. The part that touches the head in the center of the headset is very softly designed for kids. The volume adjustment is great too along with the mute option at the bottom part of the wiring. Overall this is a great headset and having them in different colors makes them very likeable and great way for kids to enjoy wearing them. We bought a blue color  as that's my son favorite color.,5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
Pretty good for playing games. The sound quality isn’t the best but they work great especially for the price. The noise cancellation also isn’t the best but it doesn’t bother me. Overall a very nice pair of headphones and for a great price.Update: its been 2 weeks and they don't work anymore already,5,1,2020-6-25,1,0,1
There is so much value in the purchase.  For the price you pay you get a quality headset headphone with a microphone.  It is a wired device.  1 end for the audio line and 1 end for the USB line that is liked to the lighting,4,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
I bought this headset for my little brother who’s been struggling with finding a headset that fits his needs well. This headset really has satiated his needs and I would not hesitate to recommend this to a friend.,5,1,2020-7-18,1,1,0
"The noise cancellation is honestly really top notch. In fact it's so top notch that it might be a problem for me, but that's a personal issue and the product is doing what it said it would do, so five stars in that regard! It also sounds pretty dang good, although I did notice that compared to my other, cheaper, Walmart bought headset the sound seemed a little more muffled and less clear, but the bass was higher overall.",5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
Very comfortable. Affordable. Great for gaming. Quality braided cord. Mute and volume on cord. Dual plug-in (headphone and usb) attached are all times. Very long cord. Stiff mic that stays right where you put it- No flop! Lights only work when plugged into the usb. Worked perfect with my PS4.,5,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
"My fiance needed a new headset and he really likes them! Only thing wrong if anything at all would be white noise while muted via the mute switch, but that being said he might have it hooked up in the wrong ports. Sometimes the front ports make it so there is white noise he hasn't yet tried to connect it to the back of his pc because he has had issues in the past with white noise plugging into the front ports. Long story shout works great would recommend getting this for your gamer in your family.",4,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
This product was really good for gaming and let me tell you about the noise cancellation..

"This headset is amazing, very comfortable, and perfect for pro gamers. The mic works incredibly well and the LED lights make you work really cool as you play. This is one of the best headsets I’ve ever had, and it can be worn by the entire family with the adjustable size. The design choices make it look very modern. And it can also be connected to any device, mobile, laptop, PC, tablet, and console, you can use it for more than just games. I greatly recommend this headset.",5,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"It was fine while it worked but 8 months later there is no sound coming from left ear. Product has not been abused. Failed too quickly. Feel cheated.[Edit] Refund issued with apology. Changed rating from 2-star to 4-star as a result, but I replaced this with a different brand of headset and would not consider buying this product again.",4,1,2019-3-12,1,0,0
"I've used the headset numerous times now and I must say they fit comfortably on my head (and I have a big head). After hours of consistent use they remain comfortable. It took a few minutes of playing with my computer settings to figure out how to get both chat and in-game sounds working (using separate program from game for chatting), but that's more about understanding your computer. The only downside to this product for me is the length of the cord because I use a 42"" screen and must sit further back. Overall, a great product!",5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
Fits snug sound is great but picks up nice like fans... had ppl complain about music that was being  played  in another room..cord is long .. the lights are cool on the side of it but how you plug the lights in USB by plug that goes into controller is kind of a nuisance,4,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
"Great headset for gaming on console. Sound quality is great and it even comes with a volume controller attached to the cord.

"This was by far the best gaming headset I have purchased. They fit comfortably and the usb feature to activate the bright blue light on the headphones was a nice feature.

"Comfortable, with great sound quality. I've got a fairly large head and I wear glasses, so I have a pretty hard time finding a headset that doesn't get uncomfortable after just a few minutes. These are the only ones for under ~$150 I've found that don't give me trouble. The inline volume control is a bit larger than I'm used to, but I've found that's distinctly a benefit, as it makes it easy to quickly find and adjust without having to look down at your cable.I've only been using these for a few days so I cannot comment on their durability on longevity.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0

We purchased this for my son's online school.  The quality of the headset is fantastic and my 11 year old loves them.  The sound is clear and crisp.  They cancel the surrounding noises out which is great since we are remodeling our home and there are saws and nail guns in the background.  The teacher and class has not been able to hear any of the back ground noise.  We are very impressed with this product and would definitely recommend them.,5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0

Its not a deal breaker still worth purchasing.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,1
These headphones are amazing!! I game a LOT online and they are perfect for my PS4 as well as my PC. I can hear clearly with them and I can also be heard well from other players.I also love that they light up! I would definitely recommend these to any gamers out there!,5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"First off, I am pretty picky when it comes to over the head headphones. Most of them are so uncomfortable on my ears, but these are way comfortable for long-term applications.

"When I got it I plugged it in, but I could hear my friends, but they could not hear me. I needed to update my controller on Xbox. After I did that everything worked great. I probably used it for about 100 hours of gaming so far and haven't had any problems. The actual mic works great, my friends can hear me perfectly and I can hear them great. Also, a cool feature is that you can adjust the volume and mute your mic if needed. I recommend it!",5,1,2020-5-10,1,0,0

It appears to be a driver issue and I can’t find a support site that might contain the appropriate drivers.While it touts being a noise canceling headset, there is no active noise cancelation. The padding does seem to slightly muffle background noise, but nothing that would constitute noise cancelation.",1,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
Amazing product! Id recommend these headphones to anyone. It has a clear microphone and best of all it has nice padding so it doesnt cause headaches or ear pain after prolonged use.

"This is unusable with an XBOX One because the mic echos so badly (no, it's no my Kinect because it's disconnected). The headset is unusable in any multigame. Usually, I know better than to buy cheap crap but every now and then I forget.The only reason this gets a 2-start rather than 1- is because the headset does indeed work for listening but if you want something with a mic, this is no the headset for you.",2,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0
"My old headset wasn't working anymore, so I quickly ordered this for the price and quality. The price is great and the headset has good quality. It has a good sound/mic that's clear. The cable is good, is at least 6' long. It's comfortable to war for me. The mic mute switch and the audio volume adjustment makes it easier to adjust volume and mute myself when playing online. The USB cable is what turns on the light and it is a bit shorter, but I have everything connected to a hub, so it's not that big of a deal.Definitely worth the money for the quality.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,1
"I found the sound quality to be amazing for this. Far better sound that just going without a headset. I ain't no tech expert so I'm not about to write a full length review of the specs and all about the design and such aside from, the led lights look pretty, and sadly don't have the usb ports to have it on when I have to have everything else plugged in, but that's more a of my set up problem. I do recommend this if you have smaller ears so it'd fit perfectly, I don't have small ears so it tends to hurt with how heavy it is and need frequent breaks, but it's all fine XD",5,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"While wearing this headset, everything sounded muffled and quieter. I felt like my hearing was similar to being congested. Despite turning the volume up for everything, it still did not sound like it should have. I used this to play Call of Duty Warzone. Additionally, I found the headset to not be very comfortable. It squeezed my head and gave me a headache. I will be returning the item. Great item for little kids, but not for someone who takes games a bit more serious and relies and audio for gameplay.",2,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0

For PS4 the setup was easy enough, when you plug the audio jack into the controller, the system immediately recognized the microphone and I just had to switch the output in the audio devices settings to get all audio going to headset itself.As for the headset, it’s great. The sound quality is a big set up from just the tv speakers. The microphone sounds clear and while the wire is a bit long, it’s easy to keep out of the way. For its price point it’s a great deal.",5,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0

"I feel like this product is falsely advertised. It should NOT state that it is intended for Xbox nor PlayStation, it is mainly a PC mic only. The glow feature only works if plugged into USB port and the usb plug is tethered right next to the headphone jack meaning you cannot plug both into a console controller at the same time as console controllers do not have USB ports next to their headphone jacks. Also, even after adjusting settings on my console, my speech was barely audible. Cutting in and out at times while be too quiet overall. I’m just glad I was able to return it in time and get a full refund.",2,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0

However, the microphone control AKA the on/off switch, would not go back all the way to mute; which kind of made me unsure of whether it was muted or just wouldn’t go back all the way.

Im only 17 but this is definitely the most comfortable headset I’ve owned which surprised me because I didn’t see many reviews about that. It has good surround sound and I play a lot of sound hoarding games so that is very important. Quality is decent, it should last a good amount of time as long as it’s taken care of. I don’t really have any negatives for this headset. 10/10 would recommend.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,1
"The sound quality is so good on these. Word are very clear and it doesn't blast my ears off when I turn the volume up. It's also pretty comfortable. They don't crush my ears and I can keep them on for long periods of time without getting annoyed. I can still hear myself when I talk with these on, which is pretty cool. The microphone picks up noise pretty easily, so I don't have to worry about cutting out when I'm talking on discord. They're a little clunkier than I'm used to, but the colors and design are very cool.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,1

"As far as cheap headsets go this one is quite good. Sound is loud, the lows and highs are both there and sound is clear. I haven't used the mic so I cant speak for the quality of that. The headset feels good on the head,  not too heavy or tight. I replaced the default ear muff part and that helped a great deal.",4,1,2019-5-31,1,0,1
"Not made to last.  I went through 3 pairs in about a year. I guess  why China has gotten  rich from us. We just keep buying  their  cheap garbage that we know 98% of the time it won't last, but we always want to save money but buying  garbage we always  spend more.",1,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0

Fit My 6 year old perfect and adjustable . The quality is very nice and the noise cancellation is nice too. The cord is also a nice length. Using on his Xbox One Digital version,5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,1

The sound is not Bose quality. It should include an extension of maybe 2 or 3 ft long for the USB cable. One needs the usb to power the lights. When using a Smart Phone can’t use the usb connector and end up with a small usb tail hanging. Bought it for a kids and they love the lights. Had to get an extension usb.,4,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"As a PC gamer, the Bengoo gaming headset has everything I need. Even though it costs only 30 dollars, the quality of this headset can definitely compare to those in the $100+ price range. Sound quality is slightly worse than more expensive sets but is better than I could ask for with the noise isolation. Still, this product looks very sleek and cool with the lights and feels pretty durable. The cord connecting to the PC is plenty long enough for me to move around my room without having to take off the headset. Definitely a great purchase.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"Bought a new headset to replace mine of 3 yrs and unfortunately I will still be using my old headset for gaming. Headset is good for listening to music and anything audio wise, however the mic is horrible. Barely picks up my voice and apparently in most cases the mic doesn't work at all!! I started looking at my more reviews later on that weren't TOP REVIEWS and seems like everyone is having similar problem with mic. Either it barely picks up voice or the mic just doesn't work at all. DO NOT GET IF USING TO VOICECHAT.",3,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"These headphones are wonderful! They have a long cord for mobility while gaming. The noise canceling feature is 2nd to none. Nothing interferes with either hearing or speaking. Sound quality is stellar. Not only do I feel like I'm in my own little world, with these on, but no one outside of my world can hear what's going on around me. Would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants a modern, stylish, yet practical set of headphones for either gaming or work.",5,1,2019-12-15,1,0,1
I was looking for a headset for gaming and for daily use. This headset met those requirements amazingly! The noise cancelling was great and the sound is great too.

I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone!,5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,1
"The Bengoo G9000 is a strong contender for the best headset I have purchased. My favorite thing about this headset is the fact that it stays comfortable even after extended use.

The Bengoo headset was a really high-quality headset. I have tried using other headsets and never have a headset had everything that I needed. It sounded crystal clear my sound quality sounds great to other people. The mic is really good. The noise-canceling is a nice feature and although it's not perfect it definitely helps. The headset was really comfortable to use and never hurt after I used it for a long time. I personally use it for calls zoom meetings and Xbox party. I have no issues with it and would completely recommend it.,5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"These were great at first, delivered quickly and great out of the box, I had to rate it low due to it only lasted us 2 months, my son is 10 and these were his first pair, and after 2 months he was unable to communicate through them, the sound quit working and no one was able to hear him any more through them.

I got  this headset for me and my brother to Use. Sometimes my brother can’t even hear me so that is how good the noise cancellation is use. Sometimes my brother can’t even hear me so that is how good the noise cancellation is.  The microphone is a little bit sensitive meaning you could hear every little thing that was in the background according to my friend who I was playing with. My only complaint is that I couldn’t figure out how to have the light on while I played other than plugging it into a block in the wall. But other than that I recommend this headset,5,1,2019-4-16,1,0,0

Brought these for my son he has xbox one he hasn't complained about them yet that one of the reason I gave 5 stars but I dont really know cause I dont use them but he only 11 and I'm tired of buying headphones that stop working but I like these cause they was in my budget and the wire was more sturdy that where we seem to have problems with other ones.

"This headset is very reliable for pretty much any type of use. It has high sound quality, and cancels out background noise remarkably well. The multiple adapters make it very versatile, so you can use it on a large variety of devices. The volume and mute attachment is very helpful as well, allowing you to mute or un-mute yourself, as well as easily adjusting the volume.

Very good at its job have to keep one ear out to hear my kid lol.  However I'm unsure what purpose the blue lights actually have so I leave that unplugged.

"**Update** To be fair, this company contacted me over concern about the quality of their product. They stand by their product and offered replace or refund the item. Yes, almost two years later.

Save yourself the hassle and try in store before you buy anywhere because otherwise you are risking not being able to return.,1,1,2018-12-25,1,0,0
Don't buy these they stop working after the return window closes. No matter what I try to get them to work they won't. The computer sees them but no matter what they don't have any sound. My old pair work just fine so it's not the computer.,1,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0

Really nice headphones for the price! I bought these to replace my turtle beaches which broke after only about a year.

"In my previous review I said these headphones do not work correctly. After fiddling with it I found that it was not the headphones themselves that did not work, but the complimentary wire splitter they included with it. After I fixed that I had no further problems with the sound quality or microphone quality as I had previously said. The only issue that I DO have with these headphones is that they are rather air tight and cause my ears to sweat a little, although this does mean it blocks outside noise well. That is mostly personal preference though.",4,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0

Nice quality my son loved these. In fact the noise cancellation is so good that I have to yell at him to turn it down so he can hear me when I yell to him lol.

Definitely needed to add a way to secure the cord end to where it plugs into controller as this is the area it goes bad. Otherwise amazing headset!! Love it!

Doesn’t work on PS4. At all. Manufacturer suggests “testing it on a phone”. Great. How many phones have 3.5mm jacks anymore? Packaging is in broken English and directions are non-existent.

I enjoy the feel of the headset and for the price, it's very nice.The only thing I dislike is that the lights only work when the usb is conencted. This means that I won't use it often since I only have one usb port and its for my mouse. It's not a big deal to me, which is why I still gave this review 5 stars.",5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
This headset turned out to be just what we needed.  It adjusts to fit my three different sized kids well.  It is comfortable and has very good sound quality.  The over the ear design helps block out background noise effectively.  Works equally well for digital learning and gaming.,5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,1
"Great headphones! I’ve only had them for about 2 days but they sound great. The quality feels great. I’m using for a ps4, and the only complaint I have is that you can only have the usb light plugged in if your controller is about 8 inches away from your ps4. Just because the aux cord is linked with the usb cord so it was probably designed to be used for  a PC because usually the inputs are usually right next to eachother. But I don’t see a need really to keep the lights on while I play! Great product!",5,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"This was a gift for my gamer husband who is really picky and really a bit too serious about his video games. Lol. I was worried about what small complaints he could come up with, but so far he's very happy with these! The noise cancellation is fantastic...we have 3 noisy kids that help test that out well! It came nicely packaged and the headphones are really cool looking. Highly recommend!",5,1,2019-1-1,1,0,0
"These headphones are great! I purchased my first pair for my son for Christmas,  and he loves them. All of his friends ask him what kind he has because they are so clear. So for my other son's birthday I got him a pair as well. Now my husband wants some!My son says the microphone is great, and after extended periods of gaming his ears don't hurt.

"Broke in one month had to buy another one because it was a couple days after refund date.

Didn't have any issues with the mic or sound on the PS4,  Also no issues with the PC Switch or on my phone and tablet. A good, affordable headphone set with mic.",4,1,2020-2-22,1,0,1
"Some days I will wear this headset for upwards of 8 hours and it will barely bother my ears. Good mic quality, comfy ear muffs.The only complaint I have with this headset is the 3.5 mm jack could be redesigned to a 90 degree plug. When plugged into a controller it sticks out a good distance and is a little distracting while playing.",5,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0

"These work great. I bought a more expensive set and the microphone came loose so I had to return them. I got two of these for the price of one of the others.

"The sound is awful. These done cancel any outside noise and only go up so much for volume. Mine has a short in the cord or something because after I plug it in I have to tap it to make it work. Tried recording my voice on my computer as well and I have been doing audio editing for 10 years, but I could not fix the sound at all. It was so bad I deleted the entire track and ordered a new mic.",1,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0

"This is a 3 month use review.Bought these for my son and he really likes them. He likes the LED's on the side (you can turn off by simply unplugging the USB). Sound is surprisingly clear for the cost, good stereo. Provides a fair amount of noise isolation due to good fit alone. He uses them for classwork meetings and has no trouble with volume or others hearing him. Really like the anti-tangle clothed cord.",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
Ordered this gaming headset after doing some research online and these were the ones that came highly recommended. Shipping was super fast and I couldn't be more pleased! The braided cord is awesome and cannot kink. The sound quality is awesome. I can hear footsteps before the person rounds the corner in online play. 10/10 would order again.,5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
I bought for my husband for Christmas. He was tired of wireless headphones always dying. He loves these. He can use portable battery bank on controller if it gets low.

"The sound quality is great, I love how its got muti use options for any gaming experience. The headset fits soo comfortably, the soft materials doesnt make you ears hurt or itch. I have already recommend these to my online friends, who might be looking for a new set with great quality but dont want to spend a crazy amount.",5,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"They fit pretty well and the sound quality is good. For the price, I haven't been able to find anything that works better. The volume adjuster has a good amount of resistance so the volume won't randomly jump on you because you brushed it with your arm, and my friends have said my voice sounds pretty clear through the mic. The ear pads go completely around the ears so it barely feels like wearing them at all. Very happy with the product.",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,1
I got this for my daughter to be able to take Online Chinese lessons. It's something she can grow with. She really like the product. Fairly light and fits over the ears. I even wear them myself from time to time now. Item arrived quickly and as described. I'd buy again.,5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
Does NOT work for Xbox one as the description says it does. I will be returning this.,1,1,2020-2-20,1,1,0
I bought this headset to use to talk in discord while raiding in classic world of warcraft. I've had the headset for a few days and it sounds good and is fairly comfortable to wear. The headset i was using before this one had rubber cords that constantly knotted and it wasn't very comfortable on the top of the head. this headset has memory foam that is very comfortable and the cords are braided so they don't knot easily. i recommend this to anyone looking for a headset on a budget.,4,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"I have gotten 2 of these headsets hoping that the first one was just faulty, but overall, they have both broken very quickly. The wiring seems to short and break within the first 2 months of having it. It also picked up every single sound in my house when I was playing and other people hated it. It occasionally echoed too.",1,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"Coming from a Turtle headset that stopped working within a few months, this one has surprised so far. Super comfortable and sound is great. The mic is nice and can move when time to store away. The blue led lights are cool but on a ps4 you have to plug into usb and can't really use them because the way the y cord is set up you would have to be right next to it in order for it to plug into it and into your ps4 controllers",5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"This is a great product! Not only was it a great price, but works great too. It is a bit flimsy, but I do not plan on tossing is around here and there. I use it with my PS4 and it has great sound quality. The cushion for the headphones really make gaming more realistic. The only thing I do not care for is the fact that the wire splits at the end with a jack and a USB end. Since I am using a PS4 controller, there is no place to put the USB end and it just hangs there on the side. Its not too distracting though. Overall, one of the best purchases I have ever made!",5,1,2017-9-21,1,2,0
"This headset is very comfortable to wear. The sound quality is good. And it keeps noise out very well. The Mic pics me up well and helps a lot online.When I first ordered this headset, the unit sent to me didn't have a good mic.

"This is the second headset I have purchased....because it works so well my son took my other headphones (same make). So, not only are they good enough for me, but apparently a 15 year old kid (who had a wireless bluetooth version before that were over $100 ea).",5,1,2019-9-2,1,0,0
"Most useful for me to conduct online audio and video meetings. Excellent headphones and microphone attached. The set looks ""BEAUTIFUL"" too! Perfect voice transmission and reception. No noise or intermittent breaking or loose connection.  Audio quality perfect both ways: my hearing and others with whom I am communicating. Very Happy with this great product. Recommend it to anyone using Zoom/Skype/Google/Apple or any such portals to conduct video/audio meetings either one on one or large groups! Also very reasonably priced indeed.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,1
"I like how the microphone sound and it doesn't pick up the details in the background. The noise cancelling isn't the best but it works. Overall this headset is really good for the price and i would recommend it, if your on a low budget.",4,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
"The headphones worked great for like 2 days. But I'm certain they stopped working because Xbox controllers are the worst. I've gone through almost 10 headphones and controllers because the headset will work for a few days, if we're lucky a few weeks, and then the Xbox won't recognize them anymore. But as for these headphones, they're beautiful, sound quality is great. Wished it had more information for installation and charging in English. It works fine with other devices, but nothing is compatible with Xbox controllers.",4,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"This breaks far quicker than one would like, for damn near $100 piece of equipment. Mainly the auxiliary cord part, where you have to pull it out when you’re done. Too sturdy for a careful yank, but not sturdy enough to last your pulling power.",2,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
Headphones are very comfortable around ears and top of head. Sound is  deep and rich giving realism when playing FPS games. Longer cord allows you to play easily without worry of unplugging the headset. Volume wheel and mute switch are easy to use and very convenient. Excellent price for the quality. Highly recommend.,5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
Nice headset for the price I mainly use it for sound I always got complaints that I would use speakers while gaming so picked up a cheaper headset just for sound. Worms great I dont really use the mic to it. But they are comfortable and they do what I need them to do,5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"Definitely an item at its price point. I enjoyed having them to have a cheap headset around to listen to music or play late night games, however I could never get the microphone to work which kind of defeated the purpose. Also, I’m use to higher quality name brand headsets so the conformability wasn’t even close. If you’re looking for something generic without higher expectations this product will get you through. I didn’t really have any other issues besides the microphone not working properly.",2,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
These are surprisingly great. I'm a casual gamer but I feel these would be good for the more serious gamers too. I don't use the mic much so I like that it folds up and out of the way.,5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0

Just received it and so far not impressed. Box wasn’t taped and obviously was opened before we received it. Gift for grandson so he will have to let me know if everything there and works. Not sure if I would ever order from them again,1,1,2020-7-22,1,0,1
"My son used this product for gaming on his computer.  He loves his new headphones and wishes he would have got them sooner. The headphones connected immediately and the sound was very clear. He loves the noise cancellation because we have several people in the house and now he can play his games without hearing us. We would definitely buy other BENGOO products. In fact, my daughter liked the headphones after she saw how they worked so we bought a second pair.",5,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"This headphone just disappointed us!! It worked well for a couple weeks and by the time my son remembered to mention that it quit working, the return window had closed ☹This product is expensive and one would expect that it would last for at least 6months to 1 year! We are very disappointed and won't recommend it for purchase. Buyer Beware!!",1,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
I used this product for gaming. What I liked about these headphones is that I can hear everything clearly. I can hear what side the sound is coming from. They are very compatible with XBOX One and they are also better than my last pair which were filled with static when my friends talked.,5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"Ordered because I needed a headset for my PS4, arrived in a timely manner, disappointed when only one side of the headphones worked.  The side that did work, sound quality was not that good. At full volume, it was still low. The fit on my head was perfect, noise cancellation definitely worked (couldn't hear anything else when they were on), but only got sound out of one side.  With everything going on, haven't had a chance to reach out to the company or send it back just yet (hoping this is an isolated incident) for any type of rectifying.",1,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"These headphones are mediocre in their fit and sound quality. Uncomfortable to wear for periods longer than 90 minutes. Microphone sound transmission appears to be fine. This set of headphones is reasonable for casual/occasional gamers, and is desirable for its low price, but it will not be adequate for more serious gamers.",3,1,2019-1-20,1,0,0
"Edit: After using the headset for a while, I noticed that the microphone plug does not actually work. I've tried everything, however, the headset only work as headphones, and cannot be used as a microphone for games/recording/etc. . The sound quality is about average.Nothing too great. Helps in games with hard to hear noises. Sound quality itself nothing to write home about. Comfortable over the ears even after a a long session on playing games. Some noise cancellation that you would expect for over the ear headphones but nothing crazy either",1,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
I recently just purchased this item and I gotta say the sound quality is AMAZING. The headset itself is DEFINITELY worth the price.  It has all sorts of AWESOME features like SOUND ADJUSTMENT  and really GOOD MIC QUALITY.The headset even LIGHTS UP too.

"I know, lot of reviews call these headphones too small. But I'm a 5ft tall lady gamer with a small head and every pair of headphones has been heavy, hurt my neck, too big, clunky. These are super lightweight. I can wear them for hours at a time and not feel like my neck is going to snap. The noise cancellation is so good that my husband and I just yell WHAT at each other all the time. I don't even need music on. Perfect for the construction on the apartment upstairs, ignore everything! Sounds great, the cord is fray resistant, and should last longer than my other headset where the cord became loose. (Different brand, the other set) Excellent.",5,1,2019-2-14,1,0,0

TERRIBLE. Read the  Q& A first - everyone has problems with the mic. We have a splitter. Used with desktop. It’s not us - it’s you. You should be ashamed taking all these peoples money.This is basically a problem with WHERE the mic is located. It’s too far away. It’s also uncomfortable for my 10 year old.,1,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0

"Good sound, noise cancelling as well. Not very comfortable, made more for children’s ears than adults for sure.

"These are my first pair of gaming headset and they are very comfortable and sound quality is nice and crisp. I use these on the PS4 and plugs right in to get you going on whatever game you want to play. The mic works well and the speakers have some pretty good base to them as well. They have a great look to them and if you use them on the PC and plug them in using the USB, the lights come on and make it look pretty cool.

This is a really good headset the sound quality is great and so is the mic plus if you put the mic up your practicly muted which is kinda a nice touch and the connected mute button and audio control works perfectly and is helpful for those r.i.p headphone users moments so all and all a very good headset and my personal favorite especially counting in how much cheaper it is compared to most other gaming headsets and better quality than other cheaper ones my score is a 9/10 would be 10/10 if it had better noise cancellation then again i am pretty prone tho any noises so it could just be me.,5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0

This headset is very sturdy and durable. It’s a little tight on my head, but my head is a little bit on the larger size. The sound quality is excellent and the mic quality is spot on.

"Advertised for pc, however is only partially compatible. Comes with 3.5mm splitter that only allows you to use either the microphone or the headset, not both at the same time. Due to the audio going through the 3.5mm jack (and not USB like seller leads one to believe as the USB connection only allows the lighting to function), often only has audio coming out of one side of the headset.

"Not impressed.  Very low sound and build quality that makes me doubt the accuracy of the other reviews on here.  OK for a PC but less ideal on an xbox as there's a usb connector for the lights (which you don't need to make it work, but the plug is always in the way)For the price it's probably about right. Just don't expect much.",2,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0
Wire ripped from where you plugged in so the mic stopped working. It ripped about a year after I bought this. I made sure that I was careful with it and it shouldn't have ripped. Maybe its just cheap quality,2,1,2020-9-9,1,1,0

Broke just past the one year mark of usage.

"So far its comfortable and sounds great.  The wire is heavy duty as well.  Only negative I would give is the wire position on the headset. since the wire is heavy duty, it's a bit rigid and hits the top of your shoulder.

It frequently cuts in and out, and the sound quality is very poor on the microphone when it does work.  They are total trash.  I am so upset.  I wish it would be possible to return them but unfortunately I am overseas.  I wish it would be possible to at least donate them but they are just worthless.

"I was using a headset that cost $20 that only had one ear piece. It was my first one so I didn't really know the difference in sound quality, but it was uncomfortable to wear. I saw all these reviews for this set and it was only $40 so I bought it. It's comfortable, cancels noise, and I can hear everything way better. I play COD and you can hear enemies coming in both ears so you know which side they're on and it makes the game feel way more realistic.",5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0

"I got it for my Xbox 1. It didn’t come with the adapter to plug into the controller, which is fine since i already had one and the instructions did say that these do not come with one. I just don’t understand why the plug in for the controller is right next to the USB port. This way I can’t even plug the USB in anywhere and it’s always dangling off of my controller. I guess the only thing the USB does is make the headphones light up so besides not being able to utilize the lights and a minor annoyance these headphones work fine.",4,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0

My Xbox wireless controller had broke. Although I had other headsets they were too old as in they did not fit on my newer controllers due to the audio jack update. I was lucky enough to find this head set at a great price and the sound is perfect. No need to spend $100 or more on a turtle beach. No offense to other great head sets but this gets the job done with out putting a big hole in your pocket,4,1,2018-12-21,1,0,0
"This headset is good overall. It fits nicely and isn't too bulky. I game on console so the extremely long cord is a bit of a pain, but I'm sure it's useful for PC gamers. Sound is good for the price, not gonna get Bose level surround sound, but that's a different price bracket anyway. I can still hear my fan running with them on and the sound up, so unless you're in a fire fight, expect to get some background noise. But, like I said, these are worth the money at the end of the day.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0

They are built well and are very worth the price! Fast delivery! Highly recommend!! A+++,5,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
"The headphones were slightly uncomfortable because of how firm the fit was. Mic communication was as clear and quick as my last headset. I like how it had a USB and aux port option. I am not sure if was able to get audio through the USB port. mic worked either way. My items mic mute switch did not work. the switch would not go all the way down to mute, so I returned it, overall the product was solid. Small issues led me to return it.

"Great value headphones, seem very durable. very aesthetically pleasing. These over ear headphones sit very comfortably and don’t make my ears as tired as a lot of other headphones do. Not too heavy, feel right. Zero issues with sound quality.. The USB plug must be plugged into a power source to make the LED lights work, that is the USB plugs only purpose on this headset.

"Overall, a good headset, especially for the price.  The braided cord with both adapters is nice.The one drawback I'm experiencing is a transfer of game noise from the headset to the microphone.  In other words, my fellow gamers can hear my game sounds through my mic.  This means I have to turn that down dramatically, which is kind of annoying.  I suspect it's because the unit is mostly hard plastic that is connected to each other, transferring sound along the mic boom.",5,1,2018-12-17,1,0,0
"The headset overall is great quality, sound and presentation.  I purchased this headset without doing the correct research on what is needed with using these with Xbox One.

Not upset, just disappointed in the false advertisement saying it’s for Xbox one without adding details about the much needed adapter 😡",2,1,2019-1-5,1,0,0
"Ridiculous. If you have an Xbox one, Xbox S, or Xbox X this will not work unless you get a separate adapter for the controller. Was so excited to use this but it won’t even work out of the box.

Still a good product for the price.",4,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
These headphones are great for the price but i think they could be made a little better they feel cheap and fragile almost but they seem to work great and my voice is crystal clear and that cant be beat for 28$ but also another thing im not really happy about is the sound at full blast isnt loud really its loud enough to here the gameplay or whatever audio you are using them for and they sound great just wish they was a little louder. So i do not suggest to get them for listening to loud music!,4,1,2018-6-6,1,0,0

I love this headset and it’s been my go to for my last two purchases. It more than gets the job done for its asking price and the two times I’ve bought a pair they were on sale. That’s rather lucky on my part but still it’s a plus. Sound quality is crisp and they are very comfortable. Most outside noise won’t be a problem but it does not block out all sound which isn’t a problem for me but should be noted.

Excellent purchase!I've tried many rgb setups on a budget and this headset by far blew me away!  I can't belive the bang for the buck. It has a great feel when gaming for solid 3-4 hours periods.  I also edit videos which this has been amazing for playbacks along with voice overs.,5,1,2019-3-8,1,0,1

I got these for my husband for Fathers Day and they've already stopped working. Very disappointed because I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews to make sure I got the best headphones for the amount of money I could afford to spend. If they were for me I wouldn't be upset but since they were a gift for my husband I'm super sad they've stopped working. :-/,1,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
"This is a very comfortable headset for gaming. It has great noise quality while there is a little something to be desired from a noise cancelling vantage point, it still gets the job done.I bought this primarily because of the affordable price tag but have been very pleased with the overall product quality and would definitely recommend it.",4,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
This was purchased for my daughter who loves to play multiplayer games. Unfortunately the headset is dead. It was purchased in February and now it won't work at all. First thing that happened is that the Xbox stopped being able to find the microphone so we had to keep rebooting the console. Today the headset died a slow death and you can't hear anything either. I don't know if the product is crap or it was something else. Good thing they were inexpensive.,2,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0
Worked great for 1 month 9 days after 1 month. The mic stopped working. I left a review and the Bengoo group reached out to make sure I would satisfied with the product. They are adamant that It's not a common issue and promised to replace it and I will pleased with their product. I am pleasantly surprised that they would go to this far to make sure I am happy with their product. This type of service is refreshing and goes above and beyond what is provided from others. Not only did I rewrite the review i am sharing this on various social media circles and Bengoo have won me over as a customer. Very impressed Thank You,5,1,2018-3-14,1,0,0

"I use this headphones for all my gaming consoles. That ranges from nintendo switch,xbox one and the ps4. It has amazing sound quality and it is super comfortable for hours of gaming. With the headphones they do have extra cords for the PC gamers. I also do use these not only for gaming but are perfect for students that currently have zoom meeting.

I got this for my PS4 because my wife doesn’t need to hear my games. Once I plugged it in & then went to PS4 settings & turned ON all sound - fantastic. Clear chats.

"This headset only lasted two weeks due to the cords managing to break and I forgot to activate a warranty in the first week, so I had to buy a new headset, which is not this one.While fragile, it’s sound quality was great, although the microphone only worked in some games, the games that they worked in, the microphone quality was perfect!

"Headset doesn’t work after 3 months of owing it. One cod match it just made a loud “noise of death” and won’t function anymore. Wasn’t a very good headset to begin tho. Only thing it was good at was noise cancellation because the ear muffs could fit Dumbo’s earholes. The USB plug for the blue lights doesn’t have enough slack for it to be practical, so don’t get your hopes up for that. I don’t plan on contacting the company on my issue with the broke headset. Maybe someone else can inform us on how customer service is. Tbh I’m not too sad the poor bastard headset croaked. Might try a snake beach or whatever they’re called for my next headset.

"After receiving the product, I was very surprised when I plugged them in and used them the first time. The headphones themselves canceled almost all of the outside noise. The headphones themselves canceled so much noise from the outside that it was incredibly.  The sounds quality was a little weird to start but after some basic adjusting in my audio settings, the sound quality went up a lot.

"I purchased this headset for my 9 yr old as a birthday gift in mid September of last year to use for the Xbox one. He was happy with the set as it was easy to use, just plug and play and was satisfied with the he sound.  However at about three months of use, but the sound went out on one side and now it is completely non functional.  It seems the weak link is the headphone jack.  He is not generaly hard on his gaming equipment. Seems like these should be revised with a better headphone jack stress relief.",3,1,2019-1-16,1,0,1

"These headphones are one of the best headsets I have ever worn, and here is why. Firstly, They have amazing sound quality which makes it really good when gaming or listening to music. However, the noise cancellation isn’t as great, but most headphones don’t have the best noise cancellation. And for gaming, these are amazing headphones, especially for the price. So, all in all, they are good headphones and are definitely worth your money. All in all, definitely worth your money.",4,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0

Not that complicated to use, and the sound quality is excellent.",5,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
This was not what I expected after reading all the reviews on it. The microphone cannot be adjusted to be closer to your mouth so I had to literally yell into the microphone to be heard. It’s a very poor and cheap design. The sound quality is horrible as well. These don’t do a good job of noise canceling. I tried my friend’s $30 turtle beach’s right after these and the difference was very noticeable. I would recommend avoiding these!,1,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0

Nice sound quality. Pretty comfortable. The only complaint I have is that the usb/headphone jack is too short. Unfortunately my computer has the plugs on opposite sides so I can't listen to the headphones with the lights on at the same time. But that more of a problem with my computer and I didn't buy the headphones for the lights but for the sound quality.,5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,1
This headset is an upgrade from the one I had previously.  The noise cancellation is great and the ability to hear footsteps and other minor things in a game like Call of duty was just as good as headsets 2-3x the price.  The cord that comes with it is very very long which to me is pretty unnecessary.  They could be better if there were different settings you could use for the headset for different game types. Overall if you want a decent headset for a reasonable price I’d recommend this one.,4,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0

"These head phones were bought as a Christmas present. They are nice looking, and they were delivered quicker than I expected. I am giving them two stars because we’ve only been using them since Christmas, when he opened them from under the tree, and they stopped working a few days ago. They seem to be good quality and durable, but they didn’t last long at all.",2,1,2019-1-14,1,0,0
"The headset is completely useless for gaming unless you also buy an adapter, which is hidden in the notes buried in the middle of the product description section.  This trips up a lot of people, as a product that bills itself as PC compatible normally comes complete and does not require additional purchases.  I'll see tomorrow if it works, when the adapter arrives.  But it just feels like they left out that the real price for this is a bit higher due to the missing pieces you need with it.",2,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"The headphones fit over my ears snugly and the sound is quite clear. A farcry improvement over my previous dingy headsets.The RGB was a nice touch on their part. My only gripe with the headset is that the people over chat can't hear me clearly with the headset's microphone. Not exactly sure what the issue behind that is, but it's a small issue that I'm sure I can find a workaround. Overall, I had a great experience with these headsets.",5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,1
This product was good overall really enjoy it. Very good some quality.The only problem I had was after a while I got a short in the volume adjuster now the sound does not come through evenly anymore through the headset but other than that it works fine,4,1,2019-7-12,1,0,0
"I spend several hours editing photos on my workstation and I needed to replace my 10 year old headset. I saw this and purchased it mainly because of the price.

"The headset is really amazing. Although it doesn't feel or seem like quality since it feels like plastic, it does the job right. The sound quality while playing games is pretty good and just over all audio. One thing I'm kinda down is how long the wire is, I understand it is also meant for PC also but when you use it for the PS4 controller, it can get in the way. I have shortened the wire and wrapped it with the sticky thingy but then just feels heavy on that part, but I digress.",5,1,2018-2-25,1,0,0
Had to purchase for online work meetings.  The sound quality is great and the microphone has worked really well.  Other meeting goers have been able to hear me very well.

Have recommended others from my company to purchase the headset since we have all gone remote.,5,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
I bought this headset to use with my Playstation 4. It is comfortable and has good quality sound.

I got these for my 10 year old and he’s happy with them. He isn’t super picky about quality but likes a little bit better than a $5 pair.

"this pair of headsets are not worth the price although cheap. It does not work with us machines such as pc etc... U can for sure hear stuff and yes it is comfortable what u hear is what's most important, and this headset u can for sure not hear straight. A example of this is while I am playing fortnite gunshots will come from west but you actually hear the gunshots from north or south. The gunshots are never on point and very VERY hard to get used to them. I would recommend although the price to not pay for these headphones and to get a different pair that is made from the US and maybe a little more expensive depending on how much you wanna spend.",1,1,2019-2-12,1,0,0
Product is trash had two headsets. One lasted a month before it developed a short and one did not work out of the box. My husband used these and he took care of them.

Overall I give these headsets a 5 star. They are 100% comfortable and not like any other headsets that hurt your ears. The sound quality is perfect. The only Con I would give is the light isn’t as bright but really isn’t an issue . It came well packaged which I give a thumbs up :). Comes with the cords needed to play which was great I didn’t have to go buy one. Noise cancellation was great. I highly recommend this product for the price given.,5,1,2020-10-1,1,0,1

"Amazing headphones. Great sound quality and mic. They sit comfortably on your head and don’t squeeze your head. Few things I would change. Instead of having a usb plug for lights, I would have a battery pack on the side with a switch that can turn the lights on and off. Second, I would try to find an intuitive solution for using the headset with newer Apple devices as you either need an adapter or Bluetooth. Maybe have an app or a switch that can change it between modes for different devices",5,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"The first time i bought this product within a week of having it the right side stopped working. Couldn’t hear anything out the right side. So, i got them exchanged through amazon.

"I was pleasantly surprise at how much bass the headset has. I used other Kotion Each gaming headsets before and this one is the best quality so far. It is a little tight on my head but i think over time it will stretch out a little. Headset is has great noise cancellation probably due to the tightness on my head though. The material feels a little cheap, so i would try to be careful with it. Overall great product for a pretty cheap price.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,1

"Seriously y’all... this headset is amazing for the price. My son plays games (usually fortnite on the Xbox 1s) day and night every day.  He goes through a lot of batteries and headsets in the past. It’s crazy the more expensive sets don’t seem as good and or comfortable as this one. The only thing we can’t do is get the colored lights on, but if he played on a desktop or PC they could. Either way, for the price you can’t beat this deal!!",5,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0

I absolutely love this headset! Great for gaming able to hear much clearly and the mic is very good!.

Sound quality is amazing.  Im hearing more audio that I never knew my games had. And the mic quality is very good as I've been told I sound clearer. That said these aren't designed to be worn through hours long sessions. Youll need to take them every now and then to give your ears a rest. The cups are rather small and tight fit over your ears which can be a little painful after awhile. Still for $20 you're not gonna find a better pair.,4,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0

I bought 2 for my kids. They use them with the iPad for gaming. Overall these are great for the price. They are nice looking and work well. They do not cancel out all sounds but for their ages they are great. (9and12).,5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0

"The sound quality was very good and it looks nice. I did not know the lights only work if you plug in a usb adapter to power. Not a huge deal, but I didn't read that anywhere in the description. I use this on an xbox one and the microphone is very hit and miss. It would probably work better if it were adjustable. Also, the ear cups are too small and it can get a bit uncomfortable at times.",3,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
I actually bought this for work at home. But figured on the weekends I could use it for gaming. Well they didn’t work on my computer. They did good for my Xbox one. The ear covers are a little harder than I liked but for the price for gaming it’s ok.,3,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"When i purchase things on here i like to make my moneys worth, so with these gamer headphones i purchased them reading all the reviews on how great they were and the noise cancelation was good.

I dont think i recommend this product at all.",1,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0

"Bought these as a gift for my nephew. He's still young and so he didn't need a ""high end"". These are absolutely perfect.

My son loves the headphones. He started using them for school calls and he loves that it cancels noise and he can clearly hear his instructor. He also said they are great for gaming. He tried a couple of others at this price level but these were by far the most comfortable and best sound for him. He says they're almost as good as my Beats Studios which cost way more.,5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
Son loves them! Got them for his video games and boy is he happy. They can also get quite loud as I can hear them when he has them on full blast if I’m sitting next to him. He’s also ended up using them for his phone.,5,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
"I have used them a hand full times so far, and can say for the price these are by far the best gaming headset I have ever had. During a long session I felt comfortable with them on and the sound quality for me is just right. Voice chat comes in super clear and so far all my online friends have told me that they can hear me perfectly.The only negative that I can say is that they are a little bulky and volume controls don't indicate what side is lower and higher so you have to guess at first to figure it out.",5,1,2018-3-10,1,0,0

Amazing sound quality. I really enjoyed the fact that it has enhanced quality where you can tell if something if behind you or where an emeny is in your game. I do find it slightly upsetting that the lights don't come on from plugging your controller in alone but you have to plug in the usb to a computer or concole for the lights to come on. The cord length is great and won't be an issue for anybody. Overall an amazing product and I would definitly reccomend for my felloiw gamers.,5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"This headset replaced my sons Turtle Beach headset that recently stopped working. It was the 2nd Turtle Beach headet that has died in past year and a half.  I didn’t want to spend big money, so based on the reviews we got this one.  It was literally half the price of the Turtle Beach and my 12 year old says he actually likes it better.  I’d definitely recommend this for someone looking for a low cost, quality headset for gaming.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0

"I have broken two Turtle Beach Ear Force XO SEVEN Pro headsets in two years.  I had the first one replaced by warranty because the earpiece frame continues to snap.  It is a flawed design for $129.99 - $199.99.  INSANITY!I have used the BENGOO G9000 gaming headset now for almost  two weeks and the sound is highly comparable to the $129.99 Turtle Beach Ear Force XO SEVEN Pro.  The microphone on the BENGOO is decent, I had one friend tell me there was a slight echo but we were in xbox chat, using an xbox one controller.  I have recorded my audio on my PC using the BENGOO microphone and I could not tell a difference between the Turtle Beach Ear Force XO SEVEN Pro.",4,1,2018-4-12,1,5,0

"I will start off by saying these are very good value. They look very good. The LED lighting is very nice. However, the noise cancellation isn’t the best. I can hear noises outside of the game. That’s not too big of a problem, though, because the sound quality makes up for it. The sound is very good, excellent for a less expensive headset. This isn’t a 100+ dollar headset, not as good as some more expensive ones, but these are probably the best value headset around.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0

I have given this product a second chance since the seller kindly adjusted the bad experience of the first one. Volume and bass are very decent. Good for gaming since the mic is loud and clear with no background noises as well mute control within reach. I have been using it constantly for over a month and everything seems to be working.Update: Over the course of one year the audio on both earphones got gradually lower. Sound completely gone from the right one and the left one has an intermittent static noise. So long to these.,3,1,2018-3-25,1,0,0

I dont know what they did differently, but it is definitely making the difference on every level. Highly recommend this beast of a headset. Great sound quality.",5,1,2019-12-15,1,0,1
"It's a great headset for the price. The design is nice, sound quality is more than decent, mic works well and the headset is pretty comfortable (it does get a little bit heavy if you wear it for a long time, but not enough to bother you too much.) It doesn't cancel outside noise completely but it does about 70% of the job. I'm not an avid gamer but I enjoy about 3~4 hours of gaming  a day, and it's a perfect headset if you're a casual gamer.",5,1,2017-11-10,1,1,0
Sound quality was amazing. I didn’t have the volume in the headphones all the way up so I could still here someone talking to me in the room but it’s very much worth it!! You don’t need to pay +$60 for headphones! These are extremely comfortable and the bass in it is crazy!!,5,1,2019-12-31,1,1,0
"The reason for the four stars , is i like a bit of a bigger ear cup, they are comfortable just like the ear cups a bit bigger,, and more comfortable. as i play for long hours, also the volume and mic control, is a bit stiff, .  Other then that the sound is very crisp and clear. headset is adjustable, so it fits very well,  great headset for the price.",4,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"This headset has great sound quality and a comfortable yet durable design. The built in volume dial is also useful, especially when the device you're plugged into doesn't have volume adjustment. While the cord length allows you to be further away from your device, it is also more easily caught and could get yanked if you aren't careful.Overall, its a great gaming headset for an affordable price, and I would definitely recommend it to others.",5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
We bought these for my nephews birthday because they looked like a really nice and inexpensive headset but took a chance even tho we saw that customers were having problems with the mic not working.

They’re nice but so not worth the headache to try to get these things to work properly.,1,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"Honestly for the price, you can’t beat this. They don’t look or feel cheap at all, the sound. Quality is there.

Overall I would sacrifice a little soreness for this product.",5,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"Don’t buy for the new Xbox One! We bought these for our son as a Christmas gift but they don’t work at all.

On the box it doesn’t say anything about being compatible with Xbox, PS4, etc just “laptop, PC, mobile and tablet”.

Between the nice canceling properties and me feeling like I am in the game with it's surround sound features, it sums up to be an excellent product.

"I'm pretty new to the gamer world, but I love these headsets for gaming!! They have excellent sound and mic quality, maybe not the most noise cancelation I've had it a headset before, but honestly I'm happy with that because I like to still listen to music and conversations in the background! It's also very comfortable and easy to adjust both size and sound! 10/10 would recommend, especially for Xbox! 😁",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0

I have an earlier version of this product and it worked for several months just fine.  Just over the last month or so the sound has been going in and out over the headset so I decided to just order a new one and figure out how to exchange the other one later (I wanted to get the new headset in ASAP).  Come to find out it was actually an issue with my controller and not the mic.  All fine except they don't accept returns on the headsets so now I'm stuck with a brand new mic I don't need.,1,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0

Sounds is fantastic. Some people have a little bit of an issue with hearing me and my voice is soemtimes not the best with it works just fine. Comes with 2 jacks on the wire so i could switch from my ps4 to my phone (when at home. Done be a goon and wear a gaming headset in public) effortlessly.

Otherwise, this product works great and is worth the coin.",5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0

So far best gaming headset I've gotten. The  noise cancellation is the best feature for this kind of headset. The sound quality sounds better than what I expected.

He needed a new pair for xbox. We chose these because they looked cool (with blue light and all).

Bought this gaming headset for my son and he LOVES IT!  Sound quality is really good. He has been through 3 other gaming headsets that did not work right. This one is top notch.

"I love these, cheap but well made and well put together... comfortable and have been durable... I use at least 4 hours everyday... 6 months later and still look like brand new... The only thing is that the mic only move within a 60 degree angle so the headset is not reversible, so the mic will always be on your left side...

Excellent product at a great price. Works very well and it has an appealing futuristic cutting edge style.Pros:,5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
For the price the sound is great. Its much better than my previous headset which was a similar price point. In the first use I noticed additional sound effects I couldn't previously pick up. Also quite comfortable despite sitting on the ear instead of around the ear which can cause pain after long sessions. The cord is a bit long and I hate cords generally BUT it has an optional velcro binding. The cord is also nylon instead of plastic which doesn't grab itself or whatever it touches from friction.,5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
Its a nice head set and does not cost a lot. The only thing i have notice after wearing for a few hours my ears start to hurt. The head phone part will work for you if you have smaller ears. Over all good set. Just need to be a bit bigger. Only reason i gave it 4 stars is to give someone the chance to see maybe i need a bigger set due to how big their ears are.,4,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"Dont be fooled by all the positive reviews. they send an offer to enter to win a free prize if you give their product a 5 star review.

"A good starter gaming headset!  Certainly isn't like the more expensive headsets but  gives you what you need.  This is for our friend's son.  I'll get more feedback from him after Christmas, but so far, I'd say this is worth the money.",5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
Ordered this set of headphones for my son to use with his XBOX One. They are well constructed and compatible with the XBOX controllers. He is very pleased with the sound quality. The microphone is clear and he has no problems talking to the friends he is playing with.,5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0

"I received the gaming headphones yesterday, went to plug it in, and only the left ear piece and mic worked. The right ear would not play any sound from my xbox one controller (3.5 mm jack). Just to make sure, I tried it on my phone and still no sound came from the right earpiece. On top of all this, there is no option to return. So now I am pretty much throwing away $5 worth of plastic and wire that had cost about $30.On the plus side, quality of sound was decent...but only on the left ear piece. This is a prime example of buying cheap, not inexpensive. Wouldn't be such a big deal if I could return.",2,1,2018-12-18,1,0,0
Great sound quality for the price. The braided cable is a welcome feature to lengthen the lifetime. I don't really use the LEDs but it's a neat little touch. I wish they would extend just a tad bit more for my large noggin but it's nothing too uncomfortable. Overall a very nice set for what you pay.,5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"The quality of these headphones are great for the price. They do have some good sound output when it comes to certain games/software. I would say that it is really nice when watching movies but does have some static when it comes to using discord and some software. It has some good noise cancelation as well, leaving the surround sound to work better. Overall, its a good product for the price and for the style.",4,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"I love this headset. I was dissapointed to find out the usb side was short, but I found a fix. I bought a female to male usb cord long enough to go from my Xbox One to the headset to get the cool blue glow effect. The headset is well built and comfortable! Sound quality for the price is amazing. I paid to get an extender for the usb, but this headset is built more for PC use. That is the fix for the USB issue! Older controllers you need the extra piece to plug in headset. New controllers for Xbox one should have the 3.5mm socket.",5,1,2017-12-26,1,0,0

"Sound is quiet compared to what you would expect, high pitch seems a bit choppy, low pitch is very low quality, I hope the mic at least works good... I have a pair of skullcandy earbuds, which these were supposed to replace, those earbuds give better quality sound... EDIT: 2nd time using them, and the mic is somehow picking up every little bit of sound coming from the headphones as if it is blasting into the mic, even when turned down very low. The mute switch is also hit-and-miss.",1,1,2019-3-26,1,0,0
"I was looking for a nice pair of gaming headphones once my old earbuds finally stopped working. I stumbled upon this product and purchased it, the headphones have been great so far!

The g9000 now sits as a backup, which is fine for the price I paid for it.UPDATE:  The seller promptly replaced the faulty headset and my son is back on the PS4.

The gaming headset is fantastic. It is definitely worth the buy. I bought it for my son to use with his switch and he is extremely happy. The wire could be longer so that he can use it while the switch is docked but that is ok. Also the lights have a great effect and makes it look cool. The sound quality is comparable to some really expensive gaming headsets. All in all  this is an A grade gaming headset.,5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0

"The headset feels sorta cheap, after all it’s made of plastic, and it doesn’t feel very centered when I put it on. It feels as if one side is a little bit heavier than the other making it more secure on one ear but very loose on the other. The microphone sounds alright when I tested it on the consoles it sounds alright, but in-game chat sounds very muffled and hard to hear.",3,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
Headphones seem to work fine but mic only lasted a couple of months.  Tried to check for a short in the wire but couldn't find any explanation for why they would've stopped working.  Cheaply made.  Do not recommend.  Unfortunately I can't return so they'll go in the trash.  1 star initial ratingUPDATE:  Bengoo customer service went out of their way to make sure I was happy.  They sent out a new set that arrived in a couple of days.  So far they seem to be working fine.  Perhaps the first pair was a dud.  4 stars,4,1,2018-8-16,1,0,0
my nephew got it for Christmas  he just loves it the sound quality is superb  because you can't  hear outside noises  its easy to talk to other gamers irs well worth the price in fact you expect  to pay more for this headphone just for the sound quality he had headphones that cost more and it pales in comparison,5,1,2018-3-5,1,0,0
We had this item for 3 months when it stopped working  - BENGOO the manufacturer have not responded to my claim at all despite having a yr warranty on the website and the additional warranty I took out for this item will not cover either as it is under the manufacturer's warranty. I am deeply disappointed in the lack of care they have for the customer and it appears that buy from China means say good bye to customer care. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY FROM BENGOO and I ask that you are aware of this. My son was deeply disappointed and saddened that his hard earned pocket money was wasted.,1,1,2019-1-30,1,0,0
"Well worth the price. Good quality for gaming (PS4).Fairly comfortable to wear for a long time, though I have to adjust them a little due to wearing glasses. You do need to plug it into a usb for the lights, which I don’t really mind. Not a game changer, as it were!",4,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"Overall the headset is good and works pretty well im giving it a 4 out of 5 stars because the one plug that’s connected to the headset that splits into a headphone jack and usb, the usb is basically useless and I didn’t realize that it was only meant to power the lights on the side of the headset until like two days after having it.

So far, I do not have that problem with this set. The foam on the ears is soft and it goes around the ears rather than push against them.

"For a casual gamer like me, this was an amazing buy. It provides great stereo sound that elevated my gameplay simply because I knew where things were happening.

"I would rate this 5 stars if the unit could be fully utilized. Nobody is going to use a wireless controller and have to be tied to the gaming console just to have the lights active on the headset.

Not only that they pride themselves in selling quality products, so they replaced his pair at no charge and we had the new pair within two days! I have one happy boy!",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
Bought these for my 12 year old son. They worked great. He really likes them. However the mic no longer works. Looks like I'll be getting a better built set this time. Headset is great if don't care about talking.,3,1,2019-8-30,1,0,0
"The headset overall is good. Only complaint I have is the ear phones area bit small. Great sound, clear feed back from audio and microphone is great as well. Everything is good aside from the ear phones seemingly being slightly offset and facing an odd direction.",4,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
"This headset has great value. It doesn't get the deep surround sound as much as expensive headsets, but the gap between this headset and expensive ones is small enough to make this headset a good addition to a gaming headset. The headset fits over the ear for a comfortable long session.",4,1,2020-9-20,1,0,1
These headphones are awesome. My 9 year old son loves them and uses them daily to play online games. He said the sound quality is amazing. I have tried them as well and they are comfortable and light. Would highly recommend,5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"NEW: leaving a new review along with the old so you can see how my experience changed. They emailed me wanting to make things right, and got me a replacement and will be looking into issues I described with my previous headset that broke. Definitely happy with giving them a second chance!OLD REVIEW: (This product was great! Until it hit the 2 month mark and completely stopped giving sound, and working. I take care of it, make sure the cord is nice and not tangled or bent, and it completely just stopped working. Really bummed.)",4,1,2018-12-18,1,0,0
"This headset worked great for a couple months, and then the mic started picking up the headset audio. TV volume muted, and the party members got an echo on their talking and my game.

Further edits will come after I test the replacement that is being sent.",3,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"Probably one of the best headsets I have ever used! Very comfortable while wearing glasses no pressure at all, noise cancelation is better then previous bought headsets (which were more expensive as well).

"I got these headphones for my gamer kid as a birthday present. Two days pass and she starts complaining about how the sound only comes out of one ear. I even tested them out myself to find that she was correct. They were broken. Really disappointed with the sound quality, but other than that, it works fine. From the little lights to the noise cancellation, they're not all that bad. I don't feel the need to return them; they're better than most headphones you find on Amazon.",3,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0
"It is a very good looking headset, love the cables as they’re not covered in plastic, which I expect will make the product last a lot longer.

Good product, get what you pay for.",4,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0

This headset works very well and I actually like it better than my previous one you're able to have more sound control with the little volume rocker on the headset which controls how much sound from the computer goes to the headphones themselves. One thing that I will complain about with this headset is I think the ear cuffs of the headset are a little on the small side and do hurt my ears sometimes after a long time of use. I wear these for about 12 hours a day but wearing them for about 4-8 hours are actually okay. Great product and I would actually recommend these to someone.,4,1,2019-3-7,1,0,0

I would recommend for anyone to purchase this item.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
I bought these because I’m a gamer with an office job working from home on a laptop with one jack for both mic and speaker. So I figured these would be great for both personal and work life.

A great quality product. For us so far for a great price!",5,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0
What i was afraid of most when buying this headset is if it was gonna feel heavy on my head after wearing it for hours on end from intense gaming and thank goodness it does not. It's really light and the audio isn't bad. the bass is pretty decent as well as the background noise cancellation. i've only tried it for my laptop but as far as i can tell its worth the money spent for a good quality headset without having to pay over $50 for one.,5,1,2020-3-24,1,0,0
"Got this gaming headset for my husband PS4. He loves it. The only cons is that it is mostly plastic so be careful with them, they light up only when connected to the PS4 console they DO NOT Light up when plugged in directly from controller.

"This was replacing a wireless turtle beach headset that recently broke at the earpiece so it wouldn't fit snugly anymore.This works great, and the build quality seems good.  Played online and was told the the mic was loud and clear.  Build seems comparable to the Turtle beach(which cost >$100) though  without the wireless functionality.  Aesthetically, I'm not a fan of the glossy look to the headset, but that comes down to personal preference.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0

Very happy with the quality of this headset with complete noise reduction from outside noise. The LED lights adds more pleasant value to the overall headset.

Overall pretty much satisfied for the price.,5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0

"The sound quality isn't too bad, the biggest issue is that there is always an echo for the other gamers in the party. The echo is even there when the mic is ""muted"" via the switch on the cord. Don't buy this unless you like playing alone, because no one will play with you because of the terrible echo.",2,1,2019-2-13,1,0,0
This headset is perfect for anyone that is a gamer. Example playing fornite on PlayStation. My son is always is very happy with it. It also has padding underneath which rests on your head making it very comfortable. He can leave it on for hours without it bothering him. I have tried it myself to play call of duty and to me this is the headset you want if you are looking to talk to others and be interactive.,5,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"Used for a few days. Not the worst. Not the best. Get what you pay for. But they would have worked decently. Was going to return them, but overnight my dog destroyed the cable so that's a no go...my fault, not the supplier.",3,1,2019-1-24,1,0,0
Definitely an upgrade from my previous headset. Sound is magnificent and the noise cancellation is on point. Very comfortable to wear as well and the long cord helps to have to hold the controller when watching a movie and from disconnecting if overzealous while playing call of duty haha. I would recommend it for anyone,5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0

"This headset has excellent sound with a good amount of bass when I'm playing games on my PS4. It also fits comfortably and overall is a very good headset. The only aspect that prevents a five star rating is where the microphone is positioned. It can't be rotated 360 degrees so it has to be on the left hand side of your face. Personally, I feel comfortable with the microphone on the right hand side of my face, but this is a rather minor issue for me.",4,1,2017-11-7,1,0,0

"Works very well, use this for both my Xbox and my ps4 and I have to say I am glad of its performance. The volume is good, no static with the sound, my friends say I sound loud and clear so the mic is good, for the price it's an amazing headset to use. Yet remember the material used isn't top notch so be careful with it. The only problem I might try to find is the volume control, I wish there were a game chat and game volume control instead of a single volume control. The reason is I would sometimes want to hear the game louder than my friends, other times I would like to hear my friends louder than the game but other than that the headset is excellent",5,1,2018-2-28,1,0,0
"I bought this for my son and he loved it for about a day. The mic just stopped working while he was playing and he is very sad.

He said that overall, the sound was good quality, but that his friends told him that his mic made an ""echo"". The next day he turned on the Xbox and to his surprise, the mic was not working. He could only hear his friends talking, they couldn't hear him. Wouldn't buy again.",2,1,2019-4-7,1,0,0
"I bought his headset for my fiance for his bday and he absolutely loves them! He says they are really comfy and loves that they can light up.

Used by 15 yo son. This product lasted for a year and a half with lots of usage. I had to get a new pair due to one half of the headphones not working.

"These are the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever worn. They don't form to my head at all and you can't even adjust them. You can't move the microphone closer to your mouth and people can barely hear me when I am yelling.

"Works great for xbox, I did just cut off the usb portion of the cord bc it’s only used for the light which I don’t utilize ever. Best advice i have is to adjust your sound settings bc on my old settings it was leaking a lot of sound bc the cups don’t sit firmly against my head, so it traveled into the mic and made an echo for my teammates to hear. With a little tweaking this is a stellar headset for the price! Give it a shot",4,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0

"Pros: The build quality is nice. The headset is comfortable.Cons: The audio feels a little bass heavy. If I'm talking to friends, the game audio of everything I'm listening to bleeds over to the mic really badly and so they can hear it along with an echo of themselves. It doesn't feed my own voice back through to the headset for me to hear. The microphone isn't close enough to the mouth and isn't flexible.",3,1,2018-1-19,1,1,0
"I bought these headphones for my son a year ago for Christmas, and they did fine for about 9 months, but then the cord stared displacing and ripping apart from the piece that connects to the remote.

Just beware of the cord. Other than that, my son loved them. If you want them to last for longer than a year, I would suggest going with another set of gaming headphones. That's why I'm giving these a 2 star rating.",2,1,2018-12-4,1,0,0
This G9000 headphone has a clear sound output. It rivals the high price noise cancelling headphones in the market. The earpieces are comfortable to wear. The cords do not tangle easily.

"This microphone is overall the best one I have played with. Here are my pros and cons. Let’s start with the pros: I like how long the site is. I love the vibrant color (I bought blue), and the crisp sound is awesome. I can clearly hear my online friends. The price, wow, I couldn’t get a better one. I give it 5 stars.Now for the cons: there isn’t any, this is the best one!",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0

This headset does a very good job at cancelling noise to the point where it is hard to hear myself sometimes. The quality of the sound is very good as well as every noise is captured and is crisp. The headphones are rather comfortable and have a very long cord so it will not rip it out of the headphone jack so easily. The cord and jack are high quality and I highly recommend this product.,5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0

My 10-year old son bought these with his own money. Checked the mailbox constantly waiting to get these. Used these once they came in but the next day the microphone stopped working. I was against him getting them but thought it would be a good way for him to talk to his friends in a time or being shut in. Trying to find a way to contact the company.  Hopefully it will get resolved.,1,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"Since you guys gave me a replacement I’m gonna be more honest this time. Everything I was saying before still stands. Same thing was happening with my plug in but I was just more careful this time. They definitely didn’t last as long as the others but that was my fault this time because they fell off my head. They’re not the best headset & they’re not the wurst, they’re definitely worth what you spend on them. I think....maybe... I prefer these over turtle beaches.",3,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0

I’m telling you the audio is impressive and the comfort is extreme!,5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
The cord on my first one somehow started losing connection right away. Upon talking to the seller they immediately sent out a new headset.

Great headset.  Good sound quality and great customer support.  Only problem is that to get the LED lights to work is that it needs to be plugged into the console (xbox1)  and for that you need a usb extension.

These headphones work well for my 14 year old while gaming.  The sound is great and the noise cancelling works well.  The only complaint my son has is that the cushion on top of his head and the cushions around the ears could be a little softer.  After a while it irritates the top of his head.,5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
Update: I bought another Xbox(used) since my son was always playing fortnite and wanted me to play with him. This forced me to use this headset instead of the other one I had. The light weight plastic actually makes it comfortable when you have it on a while. The padding on the ear pads is comfortable and although the mic sits off your head I have found my son has no problems hearing me. For the prices this is a good headset.This headset is okay. The plastic feels cheap and the microphone sits to far off your head. The sound is okay. I am using it for an Xbox and you really need to turn the microphone level to full for your friends to hear you and even then it underperforms other headsets. If you are buying this for a kid it might be to large.,4,1,2018-2-8,1,4,0

"I didn't expect much from these headphones since they were such a good deal, but I'm pleasantly surprised by the sound quality these headphones deliver! They work perfectly and I haven't run into any issues with them. Just make sure your controller accessory volume is turned up in your xbox one settings and the headphones will be at good volume and comparatively to the more expensive headphones in the market. Recommend!",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
The headset works amazingly and audio is superb. However to use the lights you have to have a USB port handy like a phone charger base or something that you can use with an extension cord. The plugin jack in rather long and I sometimes worry about bending it if I want to kick back with my arms over my stomach. I kind of have to prop my arms up with pillows to avoid the cord bending again my gut. But overall I was pleased with my purchase.,5,1,2019-1-5,1,0,0

"Hello! I bought this mic and had seen that everybody said in the comments section that it would not work for the Xbox one S. I said to myself that was crazy and it was false advertising but they are WRONG. First put in your Mic to your xbox one controller (or one S). Then go to settings and click on audio. Yuo should have three bars labeled mic, volume, and game volume. irn your mic to a reasonable level and make sure that your microphone is turned on, you should see that on the headset. Then it is good to go, Enjoy your Mic!!",5,1,2018-4-19,1,0,0
"These things look kind of cool and the headphone speakers are pretty nice quality sounding. However I may have gotten a pair with a defective mic or mic wire? Their was a lot of hiss in audio playback and the volume level was fairly low for my taste. Being a content creator, I need something that doesnt have the hiss or other mic issues. Also the ear muffs wouldn't cover my Dumbo ears as nice as my XX headphones which is also a must for mixing content of my gaming videos.  Simply put, I spent about an hour adjusting settings on my PC and on the headset but could not get the mic to sound decent. I tried it in my Yammaha 6 channel mixer and it just would not work. No sound comming thru the mic at all. I returned the item with a full refund and that went super smoothe and fast.3 stars for speedy refund and great customer service as well as nice audio playback quality. But the minus 2 is for the mic quality issue.",3,1,2018-5-1,1,3,0

I know that it is different because I ordered this headset a few months back and was ordering a replacement because the microphone went bad, and I can visibly see that they are two different headsets.

This is a good headset for the price but the issue lies in the cord where it connects to the controller. Where the plug connects to the cord it bends and fraud the cord causing it to short and break. This headset only lasted 4 months for me.  ***UPDATE*** Added one star to my original review as the customer service that I received and didn't expect to get was exceptional.

"I was expecting more from this product, but was severely disappointed by the weak and flimsy material. Almost felt like it could snap if barely twisted. The cord is also too long and the modulator in the middle also feels easily breakable. If you want the headset to glow, you gotta plug it in with the USB while plugged into the audio jack. It's trying to do more than you want it to while under a really cheap budget. It gets by in noise cancellation, but the mic is also too sensitive.",2,1,2019-1-21,1,0,0

Honestly the headset feels really comfy. You can’t hear the outside noises when using it. The gaming audio is so clear and it’s helped me find people when I hear them flanking in COD. I also like that you can adjust the volume and the headset according to your head size. Oh and when you plug the usb in a PC the led lights light up. This thing is hella nice,5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0

The only thing I would change is the volume started a little low to my liking but I can change that on my Xbox.

Review by my 11 year old son:  This headset is very comfortable.  It is good for gaming.  The mouthpiece is good and it doesn't get in your way.  The blue color an design is really cool.

"I’m a middle aged single Father who bought these for my 12 YO son.  They were absolutely fantastic,for about three weeks.  That’s when the mic and one of the speakers went out.

I think this headset is a great headset for the price.  The only real issue I have with it is that I would prefer is the microphone were bendable.  It would be nice to be able to get the microphone closer to your mouth. Others thought that my voice sounded a bit distant so I think is the microphone were closer it might deliver better results.,4,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0

Bought these a couple of months ago. They worked ok for about a month. Then the mic stopped working. Within the next month the headphones would randomly stop working too.

This headset is honestly pretty decent but has one huge flaw. They never seem to last even a year. Before (2019) when the price was $20 that wasn't such a big deal but in the last few months (2020) they more than doubled the price. If I'm paying $50+ for a headset I'm gonna buy one that isn't gonna crap out on me in 9 months.,2,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0

I honestly was expecting this headset to feel cheaper than it actually is. The headset has a pretty good mic and is really comfortable. My only two complaints are that the usb doesn’t handle the audio as well so you have to use the AUX port on the controller but then you can’t plug in the usb for the lights to the console because it is too short. I used a usb extension cable to fix this so that I could sit at a decent distance away from my tv,5,1,2018-6-7,1,0,0

My 11y/o bought these out after he broke his last pair of headphones. He uses them for gaming on a console so I cannot speak to the quality with PC gaming.

It is great as a starter, i do plan to purchase a higher-end one, but this one is great if you are on a budget. The only thing i havent tried is the light-up feature.

Pretty good quality for something that isn’t too expensive. The mic works really well and according to my boyfriend has just the right volume for my voice which is generally quiet.

"I bought this gaming headset for the Xbox One since I was tired of sharing my older one with the PS4 (I know, first world problems).  Plus, I was a little concerned that the plugging and unplugging of the jack plug from controller to controller would have worn it down over time.  So far, I've had no issues with this headset.  It fits snugly over my head so I don't have to worry about it jerking off if I over gesticulate as I usually do while playing .  The sound quality has been pristine, though I find myself having to adjust the volume on certain games, which seems to be an issue with the game itself.  Games like Battlefront 2 or Battlefield seem to be hyper loud at my default volume setting while others seem almost too quiet.  No real biggie since the volume controls work nicely.  I was skeptical in regards to the headset mic since it rests a little farther from my mouth than a preferred, however, it was able to clearly pick up my voice while I was chatting in a party (so I've been told).  For the budget gamer, you can't go wrong with this headset.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.",4,1,2018-3-5,1,2,0

"I haven't had much time to try these out, but so far I love them. I like that they are flexible across the headband so I know they won't spontaneously snap. Foam lining makes wearing these very comfortable. They block out a very large portion of outside noise: pro to this: less hearing your siblings (Or in my case the water filter for our turtle and the road noise). Con: if you are playing in the same room as someone and not in a voice chat you can't hear them. My husband and I play games together so if were aren't playing with friends we just talk to each other in the same room.As I am using this for PC gaming I have no complaint on the USB and 3.5mm jack being so close together, but if I were using this for another gaming system plugging in the USB to power the lights seems like it would be difficult.

The only reason I bought this headset is that my puppy got a hold of my old Kotion headset. The last one had lasted going on four years and worked just like new the hole time.

Received the product in time and packaged nicely for shipping so it did not get damaged in transit. So far the only negative it the volume could be a better quality and louder in the headphones.

"Bulky, cable is one of those that gets twists in it easily. I despise the connection. It's split into a Y with about 5 inches for each of the two, a USB and a male adapter for sound. The USB is purely for the lights on the side, which I don't need or want. The volume control is about ten inches down from the connection to the headset itself, so it's swinging weight is distracting. It'd be better to either have volume adjustment on the earpiece or lower on the cable so it can be rested on something and not swinging with every head turn. The over the ear cups are great, and are comfortable to wear. The mic boom is not flexible to adjust closer to your mouth, so you still have to speak louder than I'd like to while wearing a headphone. Looks dumb when lit up. I don't use the power for that while wearing them.**EDIT**",1,1,2018-1-23,1,1,0

"Pretty good headset for the price. The microphone appears to work pretty well (Nobody has complained), the volume changer and muter on the cord are convenient and the length of the cable is quite nice as well.

Really like it so far. I purchased this for my PS4. The only downside is that the USB and the headset jack is connected close together on the cord so I don’t see a way to use both the lights and the mic at the same time.

"I've had the headset for a few weeks now and it still works, is also pretty comfortable. The only complaint I have is that other people I play with complain about an echo, I think it's because the mic is too short in length and is really close to the left speaker. Also, I think the USB attachment should be able to detach, it's a little distracting and useless if not using it on a PC. Maybe changing these things would help, but for now, that is why I am giving it 3 stars.",3,1,2017-9-14,1,1,0

Noise cancellation is noise existant and the audio quality is pretty bad too. Would definitely recommend to go next over this one.,1,1,2019-9-2,1,0,0

"So I bought this for my husband originally for him to play Xbox. However without extra cords... it will not work for Xbox. The cord it has is extremely long but one piece has to connect to the controller and the other piece has to connect to the console. So you would have to sit right next to your console. However, this ended up working perfectly for my laptop for school to be able to watch instructional videos and lessons. The sound quality is good too. However these are not noise canceling. They filter out some noise, but not much. We have 5 children, 3 dogs and 2 cats though, so our house is kinda chaotic sometimes. So I would take that into consideration when I say they don’t filter out much noise. For a college student without kids, they would probably filter out most noise though. I wouldn’t buy again, only because I don’t have much need for them. But it is beneficial on nights my husband works early, and I’m up late on my laptop for school (or even just watching Netflix lol) so I don’t keep him up. Also, a zip tie works perfectly to keep the cord shortened up since I don’t need such a long cord when my laptop is right in my lap. So overall, not a bad product, just not what I thought I was ordering because it showed up in Xbox accessories on amazon.",3,1,2018-3-20,1,1,0
"The headset works pretty okay, 3.5 out of 5. Sound is kind of low but still solid playing any game. For instance, Spider-Mans webs sound incredible when swinging, and the boot steps in Red Dead 2 are very in depth.

The drivers/software is pretty good but the mic is so quiet it might as well not come with one. People are constantly asking me to repeat myself even though they've turned up my volume up to max. I've turned up every setting available and nothing has fixed the issue. What's even better is this seller doesn't accept returns so now I'm stuck with essentially junk.,2,1,2018-12-15,1,0,0

The volume is not loud at all and in order to chat with other players you have to have the Microsoft adapter for Xbox one which is another 25-40$. Very misleading. It says compatible with Xbox one but it’s not unless you buy other items. You would be better off buying a more expensive headset that is compatible.,1,1,2018-12-26,1,0,0

"Audio and microphone are great I highly recommend it. With the padding, you still feel a bit sore about 3-4 hours of use. The main problem I have with this is it is a bit big.

"**Edit**. Originally I had these rated 3 stars and that review is below.  However, I have changed this to 5 star simply because of the customer service from this company.  They reached out to me all on their own when they saw I wasn't 100% satisfied.  They made the extra effort to make sure they could do what was needed to stand behind their product.  A company that is willing to do that and stand behind their product and do what they can to satisfy its customers, is a winner in my book!These seem to be pretty decent.  The sound was good and other players could hear my communication clearly.  However, these really hurt my ears.  The ear holes are smaller then other headsets Ive used, so the padding sat ontop my hears rather then around, which would make my ears hurt after 20 minutes or so.  Because of this I had to buy a different headset.",5,1,2017-11-7,1,2,0

"This headset is great for the price, overall. The cord is a little thick though and it could be more noise cancelling if the headphones where actually formed to your head a bit more.

These headphones are great for the price! I am not big into gaming and just bought these to play with friends on GTA! Love them.
