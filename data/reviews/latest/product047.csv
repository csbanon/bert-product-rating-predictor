"As advertised. Easy to install and keep in mind it was my first time ever that I had to change or touch a light switch more than turning on/off the light. My main concern was that in my garage I have a 2 gang switch (one switch for the garage lights and the other for the outside lights) and was worried if one of these smart switches will fit next to the regular switch and under the same main original cover....Let me tell you, everything was on point.",5,1,2017-8-11,1,3,1
"I have had this for about a month and really like it.  It works consistently both with the app and Alexa.  Installation was easy too.The best feature is that it is more energy efficient than competitive switches.  I bought a Leviton switch initially (DW15S-1BZ) and found it disconcerting how warm it was.  I bought this TP-Link switch and installed it in another room to compare.  This switch is cool to the touch.  It uses a little bit of power even when the light is off, but not a noticeable amount.  The TP-Link Switch is about 8 degrees warmer than the ambient room temperature.  In comparison, the Leviton switch was 20 degrees warmer which is warm enough to notice.",4,1,2017-5-25,1,7,1
"I've spent a lot of money on Smart Home tech lately, buying myriad brands and devices, to include Wink, Hue, Smart+/Lightify, August, Schlage and GE).  I've found that, by a huge margin, the Kasa brand has been the most reliable, and caused the least amount of heartburn out of the bunch!  They typically respond immediately (nearly imperceptible delay, seriously!) to Echo commands with only the occasional exaggerated delay, none of my other devices respond as fast, nor do they work at their fastest as often as my Kasa devices have.  Once installed they are easy to connect, the schedules are easy to program (I've never had one glitch yet, which I can't say about the others), and the app is the absolute quickest to connect and respond when ""away"" (it might even be faster than when using the Echo).That is why I'm actually sad to only give it 4 stars.  What could Kasa possibly do to make themselves worthy of that 5th star, you ask?  Simply offer a toggle design instead of only decora/rocker style switches.  These simply don't fit the aesthetic of my home and my wife will only let me put them in out-of-sight places (under the cupboards and in the garage so far).  I would happily pack up and sell off every other of my myriad devices to replace them with a Kasa offering of equal ability and a ""rustic"" design, but that's not an option, and since I'm sure that's not going to ever happen, I'll have to stick with the GE toggles until I can convince my wife ""Rustic Futuristic"" is a thing.",4,1,2018-7-10,1,1,0
"My gosh, there are a bunch of techically inept people throwing shade. This thing is awesome. Works perfectly. Step 1: Install the switch per instructions-easy  Step 2: download KASA app Step 3: Set up your account at the KASA site-easy Step 4: From your account at the Kasa site tap the device name; a screen for that device appears, with selections for Schedule, Away, Timer, an off/on button and at the top right corner an icon that looks like three little sliders. Tap that icon to open the Device Settings screen and then slide the Remote Control slider icon to the right so that it lights green.  (Remote Control ON is required for use away from your network AND/OR by Alexa.).  (Alternative step 4: configure the switch as  ""local"" or ""remote"" connected in the Kasa app in the Device Settings menu.) Step 5: go to ALEXA app to link accounts and enable skill. If you screw up: In KASA app delete switch and on the switch press reset for 10 seconds then start over.11/29/19 Update; after 2 years and 9 months, Zero issues.",5,1,2017-3-6,1,1,0
"Things to check before you buy:□1. Your existing light switch ""box"" (inside the wall) has the ""neutral"" wire available, not just the (switched) ""live"" wire.  Old houses, and some other installations, may only have the single ""live"" wire going thru the wall box.  This switch, because it has active electronics, needs both to work.",4,1,2017-4-12,1,1,0
"Installation when smoothly until the new firmware update was pushed to switches.  Then only one of the two switches would work.  Called the support number 877-458-0562.  Support person asked to looked at network/switches remotely so they could trouble shoot and fix issue.  After looking at system, which already has 2 other TP-Link smart plugs, the ""technican"" then kept showing me all the broken links on my network, but would not fix the broken firmware update.  Finally it became clear, the ""technical"" was just a sales consultant who wanted $199.00 to fix the network and the switches, and then would turn me over too a real technical support person.  The ""technician"" would not correct the firmware update that was corrupted. WHAT A CON JOB!!And now since the switch goes into a coastal cabin, I can not return the product as it is 3 days past the 30 deadline.  So not a good experience.",1,1,2018-4-21,1,7,0
"Before purchasing this switch I already had some familiarity with TP-Link products because I had been using several of their WiFi smart plugs for over a year and was very happy with them.  I also had some experience with light switches like these, having installed about ten of them in my house.  Those switches work fine, but they are all made by another company and they require a hub.  What I love about this TP-Link switch is that it installs and integrates easily like other TP-Link products and it does NOT require a hub.(In case you're wondering what I mean by ""hub,"" many smart devices such as Lutron light switches and Samsung Smartthings devices don't connect with your home network directly via WiFi, but rather through their own proprietary hub, a small device which you plug into your router or connect to your home's WiFi network.  There's nothing inherently wrong with a hub,, but it's an extra piece of equipment and therefore another layer of complexity.)",5,1,2018-11-5,1,4,1
"After I had bought three good working wifi plugs I first ordered one and then another switch, before trying to properly install the first switch. Turned out, both did not switch the light on. They connected to the wifi just fine and I was able to operate the switch manually and via the app alas the lights would not go on. I put the old manual switch back in and the lights worked - so it was not the light that was defective. Tried their online help - takes ages for someone to respond by chat. After some back and forth they sent me a link with installation instructions, which I had followed anyway. Then they admitted they cannot help and I should return the switches to Amazon.I also tried their phone service line - what a horrible experience. Took 10 attempts to just get the auto response system. Then waiting, waiting and waiting. Got disconnected three times after considerable wait time and once while speaking to an agent. But I did not give up, hoping I will be able to make the switches work. The last agent I was able to speak to suggested I should contact a professional electrician. Thank you for that. I am an electrician by trade and have a masters degree in electrical engineering.",1,1,2017-5-6,1,6,0
"Easy install and paired with Alexa with zero problems. I bought this to operate my fireplace by voice. Worked out great. Also, the switch does work with a standard decora cover plate so you don't have to install the gigantic cover plate that comes with it. Fireplace controls are low voltage and the Kasa switch only passes its 120v line voltage through so I used a 120v Honeywell pam relay to close the fireplace contacts. The pam relays are low cost, extremely reliable and have a high temp rating because they are listed fire alarm equipment, perfect for a fireplace.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,1,1
"I had seemingly a much more complex install than what the instructions demonstrated, but ultimately was able to get it done. I had to connect 4 neutral wires from the same breaker circuit to get this switch to control the two light fixtures that the old switch controlled. Took me forever to ultimately figure it out and dig to find all the correct neutral wires and none of the ones belonging to the other two switches in my 4 gang setup.Took almost an act of God to get the bulk of this new switch to fit into the wall box. Be prepared to feel some pain trying cram it in.",5,1,2017-7-28,1,3,1
"I liked this for about 4 days.  Then it was obvious it was a weak, poorly designed piece of junk. It strangely makes a very faint buzzing/clicking sort of noise all the time. At first it worked fine and connected to the wi-fi, and I was even able to set up an on/off schedule for our foyer chandelier light. However, after a few days the light started not turning on, and we wondered what was wrong. We noticed the switch was blinking orange and white. Apparently, it keeps randomly dropping connection to the wi-fi or something. No idea why. It's literally only 15 ft. from the router!!! We have other brand (w*mo) switches that are farther away and work fine.  This TP-Link switch just doesn't work properly. I'm tired of having to reset it every other day just so it can connect to the wi-fi and turn on the light again.  The other problem is, it shouldn't even need to be connected to wi-fi in order to manually turn the light on/off... that's ridiculous! The other brand switches we have don't do that, because even if they are disconnected from wi-fi they still work manually.  I would not recommend this product at all!!",1,1,2017-12-18,1,3,0
"UPDATE 3: It's now been long enough for me to believe that TP-Link has successfully corrected the problem I referenced in UPDATE 1 below.  My units have continued to work successfully for well over a month now, including self recovering once power was restored from a power outage. All have continued to work flawlessly with all of my my Echo (Alexa) devices and I've been able to verify I can use the Kasa app to turn lights on and off from anywhere I have internet access on my cell phone.While I'm at it I should note that one limitation for these is that they are strictly single pole (SPST) switches, which means they can't be installed in place of a 3-way (SPDT) switch . It would be nice if TP-Link offered a 3-way version of the product for those of us who might want to use one with a multi-switch installation.",4,1,2016-12-28,1,4,0
"Update 4-28-20: a software update last month for the switch finally allowed me to schedule on/off times to automatically be set to sunset/sunrise times, without the need of using a TP-Link hub. This was the reason I had deducted 2 stars from my rating. Now the switches do this automatically and I don’t have to keep adjusting the schedule manually as sunset/sunrise times change through the year. Raised my rating to 5 stars. Highly recommended. Below is my original review from 2018.Original review: The previous owner of our new townhouse had Nest thermostat and Nest Protect smoke detectors installed. I added a Nest Hello doorbell and was happy with it. I decided to take a tentative step into further home automation by adding these TP-Link HS200 light switches for the front and back porch lights.",5,1,2018-11-30,1,1,0
"I absolutely love these switches. I have small 2 kids and they constantly leave the lights on in our entire downstairs family room area ( office, playroom, and garage). I often wouldn't know that they left a light on for hours or, for the garage, the whole night sometimes.So I had to find something that would stop the headache.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,7,1
"TP-Link requires the switch to be setup with an app installed on a mobile phone. There is no way to use a desktop to setup the switch even though the switch is perfectly capable of being setup with a simple browser + wifi just like an Amazon echo. TP-Link is using the mobile app to do a personal data grab.The TP-Link app on the mobile phone uses the mobile's wifi transmitter to setup the initial communication with the switch, just like setting up an echo with a desktop computer's browser + wifi. TP-Link's app won't allow the setup to continue until the app is given access to the mobile device's location, and the setup won't proceed until you also enable enhanced location gathering on android (this includes GPS and other info). The app complains it ""needs"" the location in order to ""find"" the switch. LOL what total BS. I can't believe TP-Link thought they could sell that line. TP-Link should just admit to ransomware. TP-Link ransomed your wall switch (that you already bought with your hard-earned $$) in return for personal data stored on your mobile device. The potential data loss includes your high-fidelity home location (easily mapped to an address), your wifi-name, other locations you travel to, other wifi signals you come into contact with, device identification, and possibly more.",1,1,2020-1-12,1,8,0
"Turning your home into a smart home with smart switches and outlets can be a daunting task.  We needed to replace a light switch that controlled some outdoor lines and this became our place to start.  Overall it was a good experience, but here are a few things that you shoudl considerThe comes complete with a face plate and wiring screws to hold the wires together.  Instructions are NOT in the package, you get them by downloading their app (the KASA App) and following the instructions. The instructions are not particularly helpful, basically telling you to match the wire colors from the old switch with the new one.  So limited value add there.",4,1,2017-11-24,1,1,0
"I've owned 3 of these for about 1 year now and they sometimes will not communicate with my router and I cannot find out why . Our router works just fine with other devices just not this brand . For example today one unit decided to stop working then all 3 stopped and now they show just ""local"" connection only which makes them worthless . I've attempted resetting them well over 30 times over the last 4 hours or so and I also reset the router back to factory settings at least 20 times and it will work with everything else just not these units . I guess they have a lifespan of "" X"" amount of time which is god knows what . I would NOT ever buy these again  and I suggest you find another brand if you're looking for something reliable . These were a waste of time for me , these things ALWAYS seem to stop working when you can no longer return them - interesting fact .",1,1,2018-9-19,1,1,0
"I purchased 2 of these smart switches months ago and wasn't impressed.  I never posted a review.They only seemed to work via Alexa maybe 5-10% of the time, but worked flawlessly with the Kasa app. I reached out to Kasa and they said it was likely an issue on Amazon's end, since the switches were responding via the app, whether on wifi or 4G.",5,1,2017-7-9,1,8,0
"Turned out not as bad as I expected to install. One reviewer said it wouldn't fit in standard size face plate. As you can see in picture I have a 3 switch plate and it fit fine. I can push puttons under smart switch if needed. I did have to locate white ground to hook up but was prepared for this. Getting to work with alexa messed me up with one step . First have to download Kasa app and set it up on there. Then I tried to get Alexa to recognize it where it wouldn't but then I remembered that you have to give the alexa app permission to link to Kasa app in smart home, once I did this Alexa found the switch and it works great. Now since switch is behind door which I used to have to reach behind to get to switch all I have to do is say ""Alexa turn on the Den Light"" and presto the light goes on.",5,1,2017-12-3,1,1,1
"I do not do many reviews, as a mater of fact I think I have only done 2 or 3. I feel the HS200 switch deserves a review. The switch worked perfectly fine for about 2 months and suddenly stopped working. For some reason, it looked like it was stuck in setup mode. I contacted support on Monday and got a case number 445172 on Tuesday. The first response was to try everything that I stated I did again and let them know the results. Their next response was to send them screen shots of the errors I was getting. I did that and the next day I got a response that the product was defective and to register the switch on their website, so they could give me an RMA to return the switch. I tried to register the switch, and the website could not find the serial number and to contact the support team. The next response I got was they needed a copy of the Amazon invoice. It is now Friday, and I got an email form the person working on my problem that he or she is going on holiday and will not return for a week. If I need the switched replaced I need for them to return or resubmit my request. I guess is if I resubmit the request nothing will get done until next week. Plus, I sure the new switch would be ship standard shipping which will take another week to get here. This is not my idea of good customer support. I will not be buying TP link products again. I do have two of their lightbulbs and a timer that work just fine.",1,1,2018-3-2,1,1,0
"I would love to love this product. But I can't. It DOES NOT recover from a network outage. If you have to reboot your wifi (which we all are suppose to do at least 1 time per month)  it will not work anymore. You have to factory reset it and then go through the programming all again, then it is fine. Not that it is hard, just super annoying. Sucks I have 5 of these before I realized this major flaw. None of my other brands have this flaw. Live and learn.",1,1,2019-1-11,1,1,0
"I installed some ceiling fans and put this switch in to control it.  I had to get an electrician out because the existing switch did not have a neutral wire.  This is a requirement for this switch which, to their credit, is clearly stated in the Amazon listing.  One other thing to note is that my electrician asked if it was motor rated, I had to do some digging on Kasa's site but did find that it was designed with ceiling fans in mind so, while not explicitly stating that it is motor rated, it is designed for ceiling fans.  I specifically purchased a simple switch (on/off with no dimming) because you should get a controller specifically designed for ceiling fans if you want to be able to adjust the fan speed.  But if all you want to do is turn a ceiling fan off and on, and control the speed on the fan itself, then this is a good choice.I have several of Kasa's smart plugs and the integration with Alexa, and Google Home is great.  Even if you don't use or have that currently the Kasa app is well done and makes it easy to set up and run devices.",5,1,2020-7-31,1,1,0

"I purchased this same item on December 3, 2017. It quit working early January 2020. I ordered another of the same. I installed it and went to their site after looking at new enclosed paperwork. It hinted the first might be covered by warranty. It stated “ 2-3 years “ which is a bit indecisive for a warranty. I just wanted another of same HS 200 and would be willing to ship it back to the manufacturer for replacement to add to a different room. BTW original would not reset. I began chat with rep. and rep was very not savvy about dealing with this item and warranty issues. Over the next frustrating episode she went for advice several times to an associate. I texted “2-3 years” is confusing & am I covered if I am be willing to ship back faulty unit at my expense. She texted “what country are you in? I responded USA and she texted 3 years is only for a United Kingdom. I bought Kasa camera, 2 light switches and wall plug. December 3-January 20= 2 years and 17 days == terrible customer service considering my additional purchases they could verify on Amazon. 17 days out of warranty and the item went beyond a reset. My problem is why did I purchase the same item before I chatted the “tough luck bozo” company rep. text person Maybe I ordering in U.K. would have resolved my situation. TP rules !",1,1,2020-1-22,1,2,0
"The physical install of the switch was quick and simple. Took me about 30 minutes.  Could have probably changed it out quicker. However, the switch went into a double gang box that is being shared with an outlet. They share the same power source coming into the box and then there is a additional line going out to supply power to other outlets. Plus the line that leads to lights in the ceiling from the switch. So  I spent some extra time inspecting the wires so I knew what went were in the box. After that, I had it changed out in about 10-15 minutes.Software setup was quick and simple. I used the Kasa app on my phone. With in a 3-4 minutes the switch was on my network , updated and functioning. I just gotta create a new room and in my Google home app and I'll be set.",5,1,2019-12-2,1,2,0
"Bought this, and was super excited, my house is from the 50's in NH and doesn't have grounded wire in the entire house. All we have is the Hot (Black) and Neutral/Cold (White). Went to set this puppy up and just kept getting a clicking noise / light would turn on and off / and the wifi button would glow yellow. I capped off the grounded green wire, as I thought this wasn't an issue. Tried this on 4 different outlets because I thought maybe I was doing something wrong (really didn't think so this isn't rocket science). Nothing. I tried searching TP's support center and nothing regarding this, nothing on the details page... except for ""NEED NEUTRAL WIRE"" ... which it seems that's what they mean by GROUND. I'm sure this thing works great on grounded units. Call me salty, but I'm giving a 1 star for everything I had to go through for this, with 0 help or explanation from TP. Unless anything changes, or they change the descriptions.. I'll keep it at that.",1,1,2019-7-17,1,2,0
"Everything worked flawlessly until I tightened the bottom screw into the electrical light switch box.  Once sufficiently tightened, the switch turns off!  I can reproduce similar behavior by applying pressure to the switch's bottom tab with my hand.  There is something clearly wrong with my switch as it can't sufficiently handle pressure from the bottom mounting screw.  My best guess, this pressure is somehow triggering the reset/restart buttons which are located on the button of the switch.Phone support wasn't available on a Monday at 2pm EST so I spent more than 90 minutes on chat with customer support.  It was a truly horrendous experience.  Customer support blamed me for everything, took minutes to respond to simple questions and didn't spellcheck a damn thing.  I've been in IT for over a decade and have installed dozens of electrical switches throughout my life but yeah....I'm the problem.",1,1,2020-7-20,1,1,0
"For the money, this switch is a fantastic option to get a smart switch with Alexa integration. I have give it only 4 stars because of a few installation setbacks that were a slight annoyance. I wanted to test it out before putting it in my clients homes.During installation, I was putting this in a 4 gang box on a single pole switch circuit. the other switches in the box were 3 way switches, so there were more than a few wires in the box.",4,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"STOP!  Before you buy this switch make absolutely sure the place you want to install it has a NEUTRAL wire.  This does not mean a ""white"" wire.  You will often find in older homes, your switch can have just 3 wires, load, live and ground. This will often be black, white, and green.When you take the HS200 out of the box you will see it has FOUR wires: 2 black, 1 white, 1 green.  The 2 black wires act as live and load, and while interchangeable on the switch, you CANNOT connect both blacks from the switch to the single black wire in your box.  No matter what anyone tells you, please DO NOT try to override this configuration by wiring your TP-Link neutral (white) to a green ground wire.",3,1,2018-6-23,1,8,0
"Installed this switch at the far corner of my house to control some exterior lighting.  Worked okay initially, but over the past year, it has fallen off the home network time and time again -- sometimes after a power failure, but sometimes with no apparent cause.  In all these cases, the switch never finds its way back onto the network, and that means I have to do a manual reset on the switch, which is not in a convenient location.  In my view, the ability to recover from network disconnection is more important than any feature for a wifi device -- and the Kasa disappoints.  It's worth noting that I have another wifi switch (Meross) right below this Kasa switch, and the Meross manages to stay online when the Kasa fails.  Caveat emptor.",2,1,2019-11-26,1,2,0
"Installing this took some doing, and some patience in the process! TP-Link's tech support, though, was excellent, and helped me through it, and now we LOVE being able to tell Alexa to turn off our lights when we go to bed. Even better, our living room light switch (this switch) is not by the front door, so if we wanted to turn on the living room light when arriving home at night, we previously had to walk most of the way through to the other side before we could turn on the light, sometimes tracking with us whatever happened to have come out of the cat that day. (Our cat has some issues.) Now, we open the door, tell Alexa to turn on the light, and we SEE where we're stepping (and what we're stepping ON or IN)!And my wife thought it wouldn't be great to be married to a nerd! This is great stuff!!! :-)",5,1,2017-7-10,1,6,0
"I have now more 3 of these switches installed, in addition to a TPLINK light bulb and TPLINK Wall Plug. They are stylish and it's even cooler with the halo sign when they were off.Installation is bit of hassle since it requires the neutral line which might not be immediately available in some older units (and please don't try to connect the neutral to ground, it's wrong.).

"Love these switches, along with the TPLink Plug we have, however where is the IFTTT support? Easy to setup via the app, limited on how to wire it up, but I think thats mainly my houses wiring, but will most likely be buying more if and when they get on the IFTTT train (I don't understand how this isn't a standard option for any home automation IOT device.) My ideal scenario will be, when my cell phone is near, turn on the lights via geofencing, or when I set my nest thermostat, turn off my lights, or when I turn on my alexa party music, turn down the lights (with bulbs). Will be waiting for the integration and then hopefully start buying their light bulbs too.",4,1,2016-11-1,1,8,0
"I am slowly working through creating a smart lighting system, and settled on the Kasa smart switches because they work just like regular light switches so an older person in the house does not have to relearn how to turn on new light switches.  I use the Kasa App on my phone, connect the switches to Google Home, and my spouse has full access to the smart switches and outlets in Google Home. So easy!Installation for two of the switches took a total of 15 minutes, and that included finding the right breakers to turn off the power. Installation was so easy, and the Kasa app was easy to use. I now have an outside smart outlet and switches inside the house. I plan on adding additional smart switches. It makes more sense to buy switches instead of bulbs. Bulbs will wear out, can be broken, etc, but a switch is stable in the wall for much longer.",5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"Super wish I would have discovered that TP doesn't have a way to turn off the ""dark mode"" circle light before I installed it. Nothing like feeling good about nailing installation instantly turning into regrets when you shut off all the lights and this switch is glowing back at you. Absolutely do NOT recommend in a bedroom if you want darkness. Why can't I turn it off?? I even tried to just cover the circle, but the light leaks from the slits in the sides! This is a feature on the Leviton brand, but despite YEARS of requests for it, TP has yet to address this feature. That said installation was easy (even watched their video) and this was my first time installing a switch of any kind. Maybe 15 minutes since I had to watch the video. Flipped on the power and it was up and ready to pair. App setup worked and I was up and running. Alexa knew about it within a few minutes and I was set. Again, the only reason I'm not happy at this point is not being able to turn off the dark mode light which lots of others have requested for years and TP has yet to address. I'll keep this brand in rooms where people won't be sleeping. And side-note - my box was clearly opened despite buying ""new"" but that was on the seller so I'm not dinging the product.",3,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
"I was concerned about whether this switch would fit in the 3-gang box where we needed it. As you can see from the photo, the other two positions were filled with dimmer switches. There is a lot of wire coming into the box, I didn't count, but at least 3-4 wires for each switch. Our house is new enough not to have conduit, so they ran pre-bundled cables of wire. The hardest part was bending the wires correctly to get everything back into position in the box. Since the wires for the house are solid core, they do not bend the easiest unless you get it ""started"" in the right direction.In the end, everything went into the box correctly and the standard switch plate fit perfectly. It was a breeze to install on the network and works great! Be sure to download the KASA app. There are instructions on it to walk you through  the physical and network installation.",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,1
"If you have any knowledge of basic home electrical wiring, you definitely won't have a problem with installing this light switch. As the title of the product reads, it does need a neutral wire in order to be fully connected with the internet and always on.It comes with a snap-on faceplate (which seems to be a little larger than a normal faceplate), and 4 wire nuts to connect existing wires to the switch. The switch works with most existing gang plates as well, and I didn't need to use the faceplate included in the box. Once installed, the switch is very simple to connect to WiFi using the TP-Link Kasa app, and if you've already connected the Kasa app with Alexa, it'll get automatically detected.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"16 months ago I bought a different brand smart switch for my outside lamp post. I programmed it to turn on around sunset and turn off at 10:20 p.m.  It worked fine at first but a few months after getting it, it started turning on at varying times 30-45 minutes earlier than it was set for but it always turned the light off at the correct time. I thought it was an app problem but was never able to resolve the issue.  So I finally decided to get the Kasa switch and I love it. So far, it turns on when it is supposed to and off when it is supposed to with no glitches.  The other feature I REALLY like is that it has an option (via the Kasa app) for ""sunset"" and ""sunrise"" and you can adjust the number of minutes in relation to, say, sunset.  I have it set to turn on at sunset + 20 minutes and it dependably does just that on a daily basis.  The app is very user friendly for setting schedules and I had no problem getting the switch to connect with my home wifi - your wireless router needs to be broadcasting a 2.4 ghz signal.  If you are looking for a dependable smart switch at a reasonable price, I highly recommend the Kasa HS200.",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"I was in the market for some ""smart"" light switches to automatically turn on lights near my front door and garage at a certain time every night.  This would help with safety in my neighborhood since there's a lot of crime, and criminals tend to lurk in the dark shadows.  After looking through Amazon, I decided to go with the Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Light Switch by TP-Link since it was the #1 bestseller, and I've never bought any other smart light switches before.  Each one came out to $30.99 (down from a $51.07 listing price).When they arrived, I saw they had 4 wires per switch that needed to connect properly.  I am not an electrican, and I would consider myself a complete noob when it comes to this type of handyman work.  If you're scared of installing it yourself, just know; if I could do it, you could definitely do it!  These switches also come with a face plate, but it only is good for one switch.  I couldn't use it since I wanted to install this particular light switch alongside a few others.  I had to use the old face plates.",4,1,2018-9-24,1,6,0

"I've been using this switch to control a flood light at my mom's home. She comes home from church on Sunday and Wednesday nights in the dark, and this gives her a way of turning on a light from her car (via the Kasa app). I plan on setting up a couple more outside light on this type of switch such a second flood light and the deck lights. This way she can turn everything on at once if she needs to. I also have some lamps on the TP-Link outlet. This is convenient for her, not having to come into a dark house or try to turn lamps on/off with her hands full.I chose switches/outlets over smart bulbs for a couple of reasons. First, smart bulbs can be an expensive outlay the first time, and therefore to replace when they go out. Second, the outlets can be moved around as needed meaning they can be used for things other than lamps.",5,1,2018-12-4,1,5,0
"Smart wall switch installs require good handyman skills. They are large compared to most switches and this means careful rearrangement of existing wiring in your switch box may be needed. This can be difficult since house wiring is stiff and it's tricky ( at first) to get the wiring in the exact right place to accommodate the large size of the switch. As stated you MUST have a neutral wire ( white) for this switch to operate.Since many ""handy people"" ignore the electric code I cannot emphasize enough that the safest way to deal with installation is to shut off your main breaker. My husband nearly learned this the hard way when he found a live wire served by a SECOND breaker box in a common box that actually was serving three branch circuits, two with reversed color codes! A contact voltage tester is a must if for some reason you cannot shut down the main breaker. If you plan carefully the power should be back on within 15 minutes max.",5,1,2020-5-15,1,2,0
"I installed this to control the lights on the front porch, so when we come home at night, we can turn on the lights from our phones, before leaving the car.Once installed, setup was easy, as I already had the Kasa app for wall plugs, and the Kasa app was already linked to Alexa and Google Home. After a refresh of connections, I could control the switch from my Echo Dot, Google Home, and Android phone.",4,1,2017-5-18,1,8,0
"When this works, it works really well - lights turn on/off instantaneously via app or Alexa.  Problem is, 50% of the time Alexa won't be able to turn it on, and will say ""TP Link is not responding.""  Often as well, when I access it via the Kasa app the Remote Access toggle is set to Disable to some reason - when I restart the app it becomes available.  Looks like from reviews that I'm not the only one experiencing this.  I'm going to try the Leviton and Wemo switches next, this is going back to Amazon.",2,1,2017-6-30,1,1,0
"Great switch and probably one of the cheapest options for integrating with Samsung Smartthings. I have searched for a long time for anything that would be good quality and would integrate with Smartthings hub, not through a third party like IFTTT, but direct integration. Although this one still requires internet connection to be controlled by the hub, it's still a much better option than having another middleman company in between to make them work with each other.I think this switch is my answer to the long searching. It took me less than 20 minutes to install it and get everything running even though it was my first time doing one of these. Kasa app provided very simple to understand and detailed instructions for the installation. Wifi connected quick and ran through firmware update, after that it was up and running. So far it has been couple of weeks and it's a solid device. I've added some rules in the hub to flip the lights on and off during certain times of day and when certain things happen in the house, so far no glitches at all. I've also seen that some other smart switches have a hard time reconnecting to WiFi after loss of power or loss of wifi signal. Throughout last couple of weeks for completely unrelated reasons I've had to shut off breakers that supply power to this switch to do some electrical work, and I've had to reboot the router several times as well. This switch reconnected within seconds and was up and running. As far as the app goes, although I don't use it much and do everything through the hub, I thought it was fairly comprehensive and allowed to set up some scenes, timers, schedules and lots more. About the only thing that I would add to the app is under settings, device info - would be nice to have the IP address as well, not just a mac address of the switch.",5,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0

"I bought this to replace a failing timer switch for our porch lights, which was programmed to go on at dusk and off at midnight each day. What it didn't solve was the problem of coming home to a darkened porch if we came home after midnight. I ordered the Kasa Switch to solve that problem.Installation took less than 5 minutes, with the only minor issue being that no electrical hookup instructions were included in the packaging. There was a handy graphic on the side of the switch naming the wires and, fortunately, all 4 of the wires were the same colors as my existing wiring, so it was pretty simple. Despite it being an easy task (for me), the lack of any instructions might be intimidating to those with no experience in these type of things.",5,1,2018-6-24,1,2,1
"I really do like the TP-Link products.

"I have about 25 zwave devices around the house and use SmartThings as the main hub. Lately a few of my GoControl/Linear switches have hone bad. I would recommend you stay away from them but they don’t seem to be available any more.  I also have GE zwave but they’re pricey and the type I want isn’t currently available either. I’m not a Zigbee fan and if you read up on either technology some sources are indicating they may be on their way out. Not sure I agree but one thing I haven’t done yet is to buy a WiFi device. So when I saw this Kasa WiFi switch for about half the cost of a zwave I had to give it a try.Now I already have about 100 IP addresses used up in my local network, and I don’t really want to use up 100 more, but this switch has so far been great for this price point.",4,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
"So, I have been installing several different Kasa devices. The latest was the hs200 Smart Switch and I was displeased when trying to set up Wi-Fi it said this device had been previously configured. It look new but I did notice the seal on the box was not sealed. The wires did that look like they were used so I'm not sure what happened here I feel like it's a refurb without being notified it was a refurb. However since I had already gone through the trouble of getting it installed I reset it and it seems to be working. This hasn't happened before but I did want to call it out so if you get something that looks like it may have been open to you might want to inspect it more carefully before you go through the trouble of installing it. Also when I look up instructions for installing the switch it said to use labels to label the wiring in the wall however there were no labels in the package it was literally just the switch a faceplate and some wire nuts. So if these things were missing then definitely this was a used product and I am even more unhappy. But again this hasn't happened before so maybe this is an outlier event.",3,1,2020-10-3,1,0,0
"In the past 2 years I've installed about a dozen of these plus some dimmers, 3-way switches and another dozen of smart plugs of the same brand to control my lights, fans, bathroom heaters and media devices. They all integrate nicely with both Alexa and Google Assistant, and are IMHO the best choice if one doesn't have any Apple/Homekit dependencies. The requirement of an existing neutral wire is normal and similar to other products in this price range (and most higher priced products). I have tried others for different reasons, but unless I need something special (like 2 or 3 switches in one box) these became my go-to.Additionally to my regular lights, which are mainly recessed sealing lights and regular fixtures, all equipped with LED bulbs, I use (for now at least) only 2 Kasa Wi-Fi bulbs and 2 Ikea TradFi accent lights. So I mainly use the Kasa app if I need to set timers or schedules, for instance for an outside light or seasonal decoration lights etc.",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0

"Purchased 3 of these at the same time.  I’d previously been using the Leviton smart switches, but these are significantly cheaper. Long story short, I should have spent the extra money and bought Leviton. Only one of the three hS200s stay connected to WiFi for more than a day or so.  Then I have to get the kasa app and reprogram them from scratch again. One of two failure modes: solid red WiFi light (where it’s dead until you hit the reset button), secondly, they occasionally blink green/orange (which is also what happens when you hit the reset button), and require being re set up with the Kasa app.A few things about my network before anyone tries to blame that.  I have 3 SSIDs overlaid on 3 UniFi AC Pro APs in different locations around the house. The worst RSSI any of these devices sees is -58dBm (as measured by the WLC).  It’s not a wireless issue. I suspect it could be related to the device having crappy firmware that gets confused when it sees multiple APs broadcasting the same SSID. In their AP it shows three of the same SSID...  Yet somehow Leviton and my other 60 or so IoT devices work just fine.",3,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"Kasa is a good product. I've installed over 20 switches in my home and they are very easy to install and integrate into WIFI. I have a couple of these switches that control ceiling fans and they work quite well. The problem with the overall product line is that you are limited to only 3 smart actions. Therefore, you have all these smart devices but are extremely limited in how you can use them. That causes you to constantly be reaching for your mobile to turn on or off lighting scenes or other devices. It's truly puzzling and frustrating.",3,1,2020-7-23,1,1,0
"A few months ago I upgraded my pool light to a color-changing LED bulb. You have to power-cycle the bulb in order to change the color schemes - that part is a pain because I have walk over to the pool panel and flip the switch up to 10 times. Now I have replaced the simple AC switch in the panel with this TP-Link switch and the process is now effortless. I can either switch the light on/off via the Kasa app on my phone or tell Alexa to turn the bulb on or off. The install was super easy: attached the white wire to the neutral wires in the panel, the two black go to the LED bulb (source & load), and green to ground. Then find the TP-Link network on my phone to setup the switch, let the Alexa app know about the device, and you are done. NOTE: This switch requires the 2.4GHz network signal from your router. I had disabled mine to prevent interference with Bluetooth. I had to re-enable it for this switch. Not the end of the world but something to keep in mind.Update: I discovered that the TP-Link switch only works reliably when the panel door is open. Th metal panel is apparently working as a Faraday cage and the TP-Link wireless signal is not not getting through with he door closed. I will have to mount the switch in a plastic enclosure outside of the panel.",5,1,2017-12-26,1,5,0
"This review is for the TP-Link Smart Wi-Fi Light Switch.  I installed it in an existing light switch after trial & error, and I finally figured it out.  The setup/connection was immediate with both Kasa & Alexa - it was recognized immediately.  It has only been 1 day, and so far so good; I will update if that changes.  HOWEVER, know that this will ONLY work in a switch with a ""neutral line"", which in my outlet was 2 white lines shoved way in the back that you don't use with a normal switch installed AND neutral lines are NOT in every switch in your house.  I believe, or at least in my case, it was ONLY in switches that are installed in the perimeter/outside walls of the house (built in 1950).  In other words, the main light switches in your bedrooms are normally placed in interior walls, and you won't find a neutral line in there, so it will NOT work. I also read that one way to determine if your existing light switch has a neutral line is to look and see if there is an outlet for plugging in on the same wall below it.  I took off/apart a few switches only to find they didn't have a common line available, only to read up later on how to best determine if there is a neutral line without taking your existing light switch off/out.  I ordered 3 of these, and so far, I've found two switches in places I needed them that I was able to replace with this TP-Link Smart Wi-Fi Light Switch.  Also, I have wifi bulbs throughout most of the house and they are the easy answer BUT not all fixtures use bulbs that are on the market yet.  In summary, available light switches that have a neutral line (in older homes) are on the perimeter walls of your house and in most cases have a plug/outlet beneath it or close by  in the wall.  I read, but cannot confirm, that newer homes (built after 1970) mostly have a common line in ALL switch boxes.",4,1,2017-12-5,1,5,0
"Wasted hour trying to install EXACTLY following the wiring instructions - I bought 2 but gave up on the first one.  I was able to join to my home wireless ok.  The Kasa app found it ok, gave it a name ok. I tried to turn the lights on but they just flickered once and would not stay on.  The switch didn't work in manual either which should have been the only warning I needed.  Repeated from factory reset 3 times before calling it quits.  I processed a refund and would not recommend.  I live in a new house with excellent wiring so that was not the issue.  Just defective I guess.  Thought about calling help desk but (1) didn't want to invest any more time, and (2) wasn't in the mood to fiddle with it until they agreed it was defective",1,1,2017-4-9,1,1,0
"I bought two of these light switches from Amazon. I also bought two WeMo light switches from Lowes. There's basically no difference in setup, besides the fact that the tp-link light switches do not have videos with installation. You can watch the WeMo videos for help with installation. I did not receive anything free or discounted. I bought both switches with my hard-earned money. There is no difference in functionality. They both work well with Alexa. Cosmetically speaking, the WeMo light switch has a black circle that illuminates green when the light is off, and the tp-link switch simply in luminates white when the light is off and it does not illuminate when the light is on. If I had a slight preference, I prefer the tp-link switch because the illumination serves to show the switch when the room is dark. It is less expensive also. I would make a suggestion to anyone who has no Alexa compatible light switches. Buy all of them from the same brand, as WeMo and tp-link use different applications. So, if I want to use my phone or tablet to use the devices, I have to go into two separate applications. Both applications  offer the same  set up  and allow you  to change the name  of your devices.  They also allow  you to take pictures of the room to easily identify where the switches are located. My only regret  is that I wish they were all the same.  It should be noted that I used to coupon at Lowe's for the WeMo switches and the coupon May the price the same ask the tp-link switches. I should have gotten them all the same. I also bought Alexa compatible plugs that operate lamps. I use the tuya smart application to operate my lamps. Therefore, this is yet another application, and I have to operate three different applications to control lighting in my home. Alexa can eliminate having to use multiple applications. If you are away from home and want to turn lights on and off, this is when different applications become a pain. Everything is working well and I love it. Another thing to know is that if you name your devices similar names, Alexa will keep giving you error messages. Do not use names like my lamp or my light, unless you have only one lamp or light. If you name the more specifically, you will not have the error messages that will call Alexa to state, "" I found multiple devices in your account with that name."" And it took me forever to figure out what the problem.  I had names like my bedroom light, guest bedroom light, my lamp, and guest bedroom lamp. I simply removed the word ""my."" I changed it  ""master bedroom."" It works perfectly but there alot more syllables for Alexa to understand. I found this very frustrating but this was not a problem with any of the devices. It was an Alexa problem.",5,1,2017-3-4,1,3,0
"I bought  pool and spa LED lights for our pool,each did not draw over 40 watts.The double ,single gang box double switch was to be replaced with this smart switch so we could set this up on Google assistant.This switch did not work. It did not turn on the lights as asked by Kasa help,and was obvious this was a troubleshooting step. It is simple to install and any body who has installed a ceiling fan with a light would have no problem installing this.I finally reinstalled the 30 year old mechanical switch and it worked just fine.I did see a review that this did not work on LED lights.I dismissed it as sour grapes....Not the case,it does not work on LED s. Kasa tech will leave you hanging for an hour and dismiss that hour with a one word negative answer.They do not work with you and are 10 minutes between answering a question in the Que.Returned item,but wouldnt mind an answer from Kasa.I would still like to go forward and tell Google Home to turn on the pool lights!!!!!",1,1,2020-6-8,1,1,0
"I was enthusiastic about getting some of these switches into my house. I now have 7 installed. Setup is easy using the Kasa app and then discovering the devices with Alexa. But operation of these devices has been less than stellar and I'm not sure the convenience of being able to turn a light on or off in another part of the house is worth the inconvenience of having to constantly reset one or more of these devices. The usual problem I see is ""local only"" in the Kasa app. Usually setting up the device again solves the problem but it usually interrupts what I am doing. The worst event was this past Saturday when 6 of the 7 switches stopped working with Alexa and the Kasa app indicated ""local only"". On this occasion resetting the switch didn't fix the problem. The switches would immediately go back to ""local only"". In desperation I was ready to restore to factory settings and start over. I did find a FAQ on the TP-Link website that more thoroughly explained operation, function of the buttons and what you should expect when pushing one of the buttons. Short story is that I pushed the ""restart"" button on the switch and the switches were back in operation, all but one that is. The remaining switch required one more reset after going through the restart procedure. My concern is how could this number of devices go out of service at the same time. Did TP-Link try to do an update and it failed? That particular incident took 90 minutes to sort out. The documentation that accompanies this device is lacking and there is really no information at all if your device starts acting up.",3,1,2018-3-4,1,2,0

"These smart switches look well designed so I purchased three for my different rooms. Installation was easy and well though-out. Just follow the instructions on your phone and that's it. Out of my three switches one seems to have a mechanical defect. When clicking it makes a noisy click rather than the soft click so instead of returning the switch to Amazon as I'm still within 30 days I contacted Tp-link's tech support to see if they could replace it as part of my discovery of their customer service. Email response time was reasonable with one-day delay but it was exhausting. They asked me to try one thing after another to the point I decided to cut the loss, cancelled my RMA request, and returned the faulty switch to Amazon. This is one negative aspect in buying from a Chinese vendor like Foscam or Tp-Link. Their employees work very hard to make sure the anything replaced under warranty has exhausted ALL other options. Even though I like Tp-link's smart switches they cost 25-50% more than their competitors so I expect much better service than the cheaper vendors when paying this much. On the surface their two-year warranty seems generous but it's no better than another vendor with six-month warranty if I have to pull my hair out trying to get the broken product replaced. I'll be looking at switches from other vendors instead.",2,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0
"Sadly, I now have a number of smart plugs and switches from a number of different companies and all work well EXCEPT the TP-Link ones.  My Echo Plus is constantly telling me that ""TP-Link is not responding"" when plugs and switches from other companies seem to be doing fine.  Sometimes the Echo will say that the ""TP-Link is not responding"" but then the light or switch does respond about 10 seconds later.  I don't know why TP-Link's devices have to be closer to the router than the other devices to work and even then don't always respond.  It's like they need a first non-responsive signal to start listening and then on the next request maybe they'll respond.",2,1,2017-12-15,1,4,0
"Nice product. Good packaging. Comes with (difficult to remove) face-plate and gaskets. Instructions are very minimal, but refer you to the Kasa application for installation and setup. This works ok, but they could have given a brief print instruction, in my opinion. Installed in place of old timer switch which failed.  My switch box has a neutral so power was not any issue for me. Wire up the two blacks to the power and the light feed, wire the ground to the box ground, wire the neutral to the neutral. It powers up in already in setup mode and is ready to talk with the Kasa ap, which finds it even before it is logged to the local network. (Bluetooth? not sure how, and it does not say). Provide it the password to selected local WiFi and it is ready to go. Kasa allows you to name it  and set time schedules, including on at sunset, as well as control it directly. It also has a local button to act like a switch without Kasa. Linking with Alexa app also very intuitive. Alexa asks for your Kasa password, then allows you to find the device on the local network. Voice control very smooth with Alexa also. ""Alexa turn on Driveway"" .. So far I have three of these hubless TpLink devices.

I'm no electrician, but it was pretty easy.  It comes with a very nice face plate that hides all screws so it actually looks better than my old programmable switches - it's a nice simply and clean look.  The wires didn't match the colors in my wall so I had to Google that and find the alternative colors that are used and once I figured that out, everything went well.

Kasa App is very easy to  open, It works with my alexa, and I can also control it on my alexa app.Update: It worked amazingly until that firmware update, now the light switch itself still works but the kasa app will no longer connect to my switch.

They all might be this size and I simply do not know if there are smaller ones.My second complaint is the screwless  plastic cover plate is cheap, difficult to snap on and likely to break. Well the switch is inexpensive and all these shortcomings are minor given the price of the switch.  I would recommend the product  and just say if it will not fit in the switch box you intended for it, you can probably find another in your house where you can use it.  You will need a neutral and a ground is recommended.  It was quick and easy to hook up to  my network and integrate with my iPhone and Echo network.

"We started with the Philips Hue bulbs but quickly discovered that using conventional/led bulbs with Smart light switches is definitely the way to go. Here's why: if you have a conventional light switch and turn it off, your fancy smart bulb is useless.  Most homeowners are probably used to walking into a room and flipping a switch. That is a very hard habit to break. Additionally, smart bulbs require you to either use your phone or voice to turn them on and off... We'd find ourselves standing there for 5-10 seconds working through phone apps or talking to Alexa to get the lights on or off.  No thanks!With the switch, you can talk to Alexa when it's convenient, you can 'flip the switch' when you walk in or out, or schedule lights on/off at will... and the wife is MUCH happier!",5,1,2019-9-2,1,0,0
"I like the scheduling capability, and I like the sleek look of the switch. I also like that it's completely contained in a plastic housing, with the wires coming out of it. Another similar switch I looked at had exposed screws on the bottom of the switch you had to screw the home wiring to. Not cool. This one uses wire nuts and is very shielded.There are a few things I don't like about it. Like why does the little light on the switch come on when the device is switched off?

Both wife and daughter think i need to install lots more of these switches. I love how easy the are to install and setup. I have several routines programed for automation (since they integrate seamlessly with the Amazon and Google products) so we never come home after dark to a dark house, porch and coach lights on, etc. Even if someone comes to the door after we go to bed, the porch light will automatically turn on for 20 minutes.

Since this switch is to control my outdoor house lights I wanted to add it to my Alexa sunset and sunrise routines.  Alexa allows plus/minus sunset/sunrise times.  The Kasa app allows only sunset/sunrise/tod in it's scheduler.  Since I have to use the Kasa app to schedule, I can only assume that if my phone battery runs out, the routines won't fire.  I gave it 3 stars because it minimally does what I need but in these days of home automation I expected better integration with the leading vendors but this switch apparently has no comparability with Google or Samsung Smart Home and only minimally integrating with Amazon.",3,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0
"The reason I give the KASA Switch a 3 is:When I had trouble for the first time on one of my switches that lit my bathroom, I called KASA technical support. The switch had been working for seven months with no problems and all of a sudden stopped working. I called KASA support and the technician there told me that I had to get an electrician to come out and determine if the switch was wired correctly. I told him it would cost $200 to get electrician to come out and check a switch that was already working correctly. Originally I paid only $39 for the cost of switch and why would I want to pay $200 to electrician to take two screws out and see that the switch was a sealed unit and there was nothing he could test anyway. I really did not like the technical support that I got from KASA. It seems kind of dumb to spend $200 to check a $39 switch.",3,1,2017-5-6,1,2,0
"I made the jump to a ""Smart Home"" a little over a month ago after Alexa joined our family. After talking to some friends, doing some research and assesing my needs I settled on TP-Link because of the variety of Smart products they offered, no requirements for a Hub, the lower cost and the ability to control everything from one simple app on my Smart phone and Amazon""s Alexa.I have not been disappointed. After a very short learning curve, I surprisingly found the installation and set-up of all the TP-Link Smart devices extremely easy and intuitive. I have installed several different Smart devices including three different bulbs (LB-100, 120 & 130) depending on the area, as well as, Smart Switches (HB-200) and Smart Plugs. All of it has installed, programed and worked with few problems.",5,1,2018-1-19,1,1,0
"I bought this switch after finding out I could not use the Kasa switch 3 way kit which (comes with two) as a single pole switch. The switch works good, slight delay when turned on/off but to be expected. Very easy to install and app walks you through each step. When used in routines I found that you need to be careful not to turn off/on too quickly in the routine as it executes too quickly and light remains on/off, fixing my routine fixed this. So far good switch for fair price. Remember to get a switch plate to match what your setup is going to be if it's installed in a 2 gang or more. I like this switch as it toggles on/off not an actual rocker switch so pushing the switch toggles on/off. The switch is actually never in the wrong position which makes for no confusion, it's more of a ""push button"" which is great. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I just installed it recently",4,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"I was so shocked at how cheap this is compared to the WeMo switch I bought for $50 at Lowe's. Now I'm considering returning the Lowe's one and replacing it with another of this Kasa HS200 Tp-Link switch!

Because when me and my gf goes to work, then we don't want our dog to be in the darkness by himself.Most of my lights are 3 ways switch and having to install all of them with the 3 ways switch kit would be expansive.  So I learned how to kill one of the switch and just use the Kasa Smart light Switch on the other one.  Having just access to one switch does bother me and I love how I got the KASA to hook up with the weather thru IFTTT.",4,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
I have several Kasa Smart Switches and a couple of Smart Plugs in my home.  Performance- wise I have been generally satisfied with all of them.  But there are some caveats.1.  Power outages will sometimes lead to the unit unable to get back onto the network.  When this occurs - you need to set it up again as if new.  This is a pain that can be magnified if you have it tied into Alexa routines as they would be treated as new devices.,4,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"The sales information isn't clear. This item requires two distinct power/load circuits to operate, something most pre-WWI homes (and many post WWI homes) do not have. Many wall switches have simply a green (ground), neutral (white) and black (hot) wire - some don't even have the green, using the box and the shield (BX conduit) to provide the ground. The TP-Link requires two hot wires to operate. TP-Link tech support says that one is to power the switch, and one is to power the light. This information was not available until the instructions were downloaded (not in the package). Simply running both black wires from the single wire in the wall doesn't work, which is confusing, but that was the only explanation tech support would give me. Since not one single-gang switch in my house has two hot wires associated with it, I had to return what promised to be a good, workable product.",2,1,2017-1-6,1,5,0
"Over the past year or two, I've been slowly converting my 'dumb' home into a 'smart' one, and these switches are one of the changes I've been adding.  (Specifically, I'm using one of these in my hallway, one in my guest bedroom, one in my guest bathroom, a 3-way version in my kitchen, and a 3-way version in my entryway.)First off: once set up and running, these work and work well.  The ones in my guest bedroom, hallway, and kitchen have been installed for about six months now and work perfectly.

"My home is one year old.  I wanted these switches for the front eave lights, front porch lights and the outside lights around the garage.  I also did one for our front room.  I wanted them for simulated occupancy when we are gone and also for reduction in cost due to kids/spouse leaving them on all day and night.  I installed two of the switches in a three gang box, one in a three gang box and one in a single gang box.  Install went great.  They are a robust beautiful little switch.  They were so simple to get set up once installed.  The Kasa Smart app is elegant and full of features.  Overall I’m very pleased.  I’d love to see Kasa add a voltage indication feature to the app but it’s totally unnecessary.  I’m a geek for info like that.  The only problem I had was that amazon sent me a previously used switch that had been both installed and configured.  I was able to get everything to work fine but I don’t like getting used stuff when I pay for a new unused item.  You feel like someone is trying pulling a fast one on you. I would suggest that if you are considering a purchase, that you move forward with no hesitation.  If anything changes, I will update this review.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"I installed the switch in our theater room and it works perfectly.  Generally, I don't like playing with electricity but installation was a breeze and incorporating the switch with Alexa was no problem.  With the room having no windows it is completely dark when you turn the lights out so it is great to have you and your guests get seated and situated then tell Alexa to turn out the lights and at the end of the movie have her turn on the lights so one doesn't trip.  Since it is a theater room, the walls are a dark plum and the ceiling is black and the carpet is dark gray.  I am seriously considering ordering some more for other rooms in the house, especially since my wife has a bad habit of leaving lights on when she leaves a room.  I have had a few months now and no issues so far.  I highly recommend .",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
I bought these smart switches to control lights in my home.  Most of the smart switches went to outdoor lights as it was the best option for me to have the best control of lights I needed to operated remotely.  The install is super easy and they connect to my wifi with no issues.  Every one that I have installed needed a firmware update immediately after installing but they were operational in minutes.  Pairing with Alexa app was also easy and I was turing on and off my lights using my echo dot in minutes after install.  They are a little bulky compared to normal switches so make sure you push the wires and wire nuts to the far back of the box you are installing them in or you won't fit them in on the first shot evenly.  They do need to be grounded and I had to ground them to a metal electrical box in one installation as I have some older wiring in my home along with some newer but the switches work great and wifi signal is not an issue in plastic or metal boxes.I also love that when the lights are off you see a light ring in the body of the switch.  You can instantly tell if the lights are on or off and if it is dark in the room you can easily find the switches.  They also make a satisfying click when depressed and I haven't had a single issue with all 4 of my Kasa Smart Light Switches.,5,1,2019-3-16,1,0,1

"I usually don't give five stars to a product, but in this case, I must.  I am so impressed about how easy it was to install and configure these switches (I bought two, installed side by side in the same wall box) and how well they work.  I installed these to control some outdoor flood lights attached to my barn/work shop that is over 100 feet away from my house.  The access point is located on the second floor of my house on the side facing the barn.  With my cell phone, I can usually pick up about 2 bars of WiFi out there.  So I wasn't sure that these switches would work with the weak signal.  But they had absolutely no problem connecting and staying connected to the access point.Being able to create programs for these switches (like on at dusk and off at dawn) as well as being able to turn them off and on with my cell from anywhere is great.  No hub needed.  No subscription required.  They just work.",5,1,2018-10-13,1,0,0

"I love them with Alexa and trying to curb my wasteful habits, but the only pisser is these use a few watts themselves.  I have 8 HS110s and 5 of these and no other parasitic loads on the circuits these live on.  With the fridge,  garage freezer, and pool not cycling my house sits about 85w static, if I open the circuits where these live it goes down to about 45w, leading me to believe the 13 devices are pulling about 40w.  Just to chase my tail a little I energized the circuits where these live, saw the 85 watts again, then unplugged the 8 HS110s, and it dropped by about 25w leading me to believe the HS110s are about 3w each, and these switches are in the same neighborhood.The Kasa app is a little sluggish but it's nice seeing the power of the HS110s and setting the away mode when I'm on the road.  It works great with Alexa and I love ""echo everything off"" and hearing things turning off all over the house before I go to sleep.",5,1,2017-7-6,1,2,0
"I ordered this switch to control a light and thought it would be a fairly quick install.  When I pulled the old switch out, I noticed there were 3 black wires and no white wire connected to the switch.  My switch situation is that it is on the same run as several outlets which always have power to them.  The two black wires at the bottom of the switch were a continuation of that line while the black wire at the top was to the light.  There were 3 neutral wires (white) in the back of the box, however they were not connected to the switch.So here is what I did:",4,1,2017-10-8,1,3,1
"I couldn't be happier with my choice to go with TP-Link Switches.  I looked at several other options, including the Lutron which my Sister and Bro-in-law use.  Also a great option but requires a separate hub and costs significantly more.  The Kasa switch connects directly to Wi-Fi and has a great App (at least Android that I use) to walk you through set-up and use.  I have 6 of the HS200, one HS220, and one HS210 currently in my home and they have all worked as advertised.  I use them with Amazon Alexa and the integration and function has been seemless.  I started installing these about a year ago and will continue to slowly replace all my switches.  I have sunrise and sunset set-up for my outside lights, away mode integrated with my Ecobee thermostat to alternate lights during the evening when out, and my kids are delighted to tell Alexa to turn off ""Billy"" (my sons choice of name for his lights) and ""My Light"" (daughters, choice) when going to bed.A couple of notes for future buyers:",5,1,2019-2-28,1,1,0
"We have 12 recessed lights in our basement and replacing the switch with this wifi switch was much cheaper than replacing all of the bulbs with smart bulbs, then grouping them, and then making a routine in Alexa.  The switch is fatter in the back than a normal switch so I had to replace the metal switch box with a plastic one because the side screws were almost touching the metal and I was worried that they might arc to the box.  The switch looks like a modern flat toggle but does not toggle up and down - you just press the bottom to turn it on and the bottom to turn it off again.  There is a small circle that is lighted when the switch is off to tell you where the switch is.  The other switch in the box is a 3 way and will eventually be replaced with a TP Link 3 way.",4,1,2019-11-6,1,0,1
"Was really tough to install, the unit is VERY bulky and the wires are hard wired to the unit extend from the lower back of the unit. This causes issues with fitting it into the wall box because 1) This was 3-4mm deeper than my lutron dimmer 2) 3 wired hard wired to base (not sides like most switches) means more cable to stuff at the back 3) Required neutral wire (some competitor units do not need this because of the above I spent hours trimming wires, tucking them into the wall, pushing and stuffing trying to get this damn thing to fit!!

All of my rear patio lights are now on a schedule, as well as being able to be turned on/off with voice via Alexa or using my app, as well as my dining room chandelier. It’s rad af and impresses everyone when they are over.Easy to install, assuming your house wasn’t built in the 20s and you have a neutral wire, which you should definitely check for before purchasing these (turn off the relevant breaker and remove the plate to see inside the junction.) Neutral wires are (usually) white and this product will NOT work without one.

"I have installed several smart plugs to control table lamps in my home and vacation home and I wanted a solution for the front porch light in the vacation home.  Note: all the smart plugs I have tried can survive a power outage without having to be reset to function properly.  I installed this switch in a basement junction box to replace a failed electromechanical timer because the first floor switch box did not have access to the common wire in the circuit and this switch needs common, hot and ground to power itself. It installed easily and integrated perfectly with Alexa and I was able to set up a routine for it to go on and off according to sunset and sunrise times. That is an Alexa feature I really like, so you don’t have to reset the timer/switch every time there is a season change. Alexa also allows you to set a routine so it is offset by your choice of minutes before or after sunrise or sunset, so all of your switches lamps won’t turn on exactly at Sunset. If someone is staking out your house for a robbery they will notice several lights going on simultaneously.  Back to the Kasa switch:  the only issue I have with this switch is that it needs to be physically reset after a power failure. Since I installed this switch in the house I spend the least amount of time in, that means the light will not be switched until I get there, notice it is on when it should not be, and go down to the basement to reset it. It does seem to fail in the ON condition, so the light stays on all the time. Now I am considering redoing the wiring to add an outlet and plug so I can use one of the Alexa enabled smart plugs instead of this switch so that it will survive a power outage. If the smart plugs can all do this why can’t the smart switch do it?  Also, if your home was wired 10 or more years ago as mine were, you may not have the common wire available in any of your light switch boxes, making it impossible to wire and use this or any other type of smart switch. I recommend you check your wiring before buying one of these.",4,1,2019-8-24,1,0,0

"After experimenting with a number of different smart switches, settled on the Kasa / TP Link and installed them throughout my home.  Physical installation is straightforward.  Note, like all of these WiFi switches, they are pretty deep and thus it's a challenge to install doubles or triples into those particular switch-boxes.  The software is adequate, and does have room for improvement (the scheduling is not intuitive in my opinion)  but unlike some competitors, it actually works and setting up the switches is relatively painless.  At this price point, I would highly recommend this product and it work great with Alexa.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"I've installed 14 Kasa smart switches in my new construction home and am planning on installing another 6-10.  These are ""rocker"" style switches which means the switch depresses and springs back rather than toggling, I actually like that because it keeps multi gang switches looking clean (I have having some switches toggled up and others down).  There is a small illuminated circle that appears when the switch is off to make it easy to find the switch in the dark.  I use my switches with Alexa and with the Kasa app (which is excellent).  The switches are somewhat large which can make multi-gang installation a little bit of an adventure but still do-able.",5,1,2019-3-4,1,1,0

I had to stand in front of the Wemo switches for approx 10 minutes to get each one back up.  After 2 or 3 years of this frustration I replaced a few with this switch and after a trial period I replaced the rest of my Wemo switches with the TP-Link.  An added plus they were less than half the price I paid for Wemo.  I am giving the Wemo switches away. Would not use those again.

"I have several TP-link single-pole switches aorund my house to replace regular ""decora"" switches. These don't stand out, and regular people can use them without having to talk to Echo or use the app, which is good for visitors who might otherwise shut off power to smart bulbs.This one took a little longer to install because the junction box I was putting it in had two circuits running through it, and it was a tight fit.  Plus, it was a double box.  So, I went back to Amazon and bought some snap-on double gang decora plates, which fit in with the rest of my tp-link switches and look nice.  Set up is easy, and I have my switches set on a schedule, as well as using IFTTT to have certain lights turn on or off at sunset or sunrise.  I never come home to a dark house.  When it's cloudy, I just say, ""Alexa, lights on in the kitchen"" or something like that.

Good little switch. Learned a lot while installing it. I ended up purchasing a book to help me with wiring because I got confused by the neutrals.

Not all purveyors of smart devices support strong wifi passwords (i.e., passwords with symbols) ... Kasa does. My biggest installation problem has been scant space for wiring and the switch in the wall box.

"This switch works to turn on and off a light via the Alexa home assistant - it does not dim the lights. With that said, it is very easy to wire, but does require a ground or it will not work - check to make sure you have one as not all switches do depending on how old the electrical installation is. WiFi set up is very easy as well.The switch does not actually flip, but clicks. Thus you have to press the bottom which will go in and come back out upon release. Once set up you can use the switch as normal by pressing or asking Alexa to turn if on/off. It's speed is only limited by the home assistant, but it does respond well. Refer to picture to see how bright the light is when off.",5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,1
"I'm definitely a tech geek so the idea of a smart switch really appealed to me. ""Hey, I can switch on a light with my voice or on my phone from my office or in the car . . ."" So it's clearly cool that way, but the advertising wasn't crazy clear about this particular switch and how it only works with a light that is controlled by a single switch.  So I'm techie but not exactly a licensed electrician consequently, I didn't know the difference or what those other kind of switches were called.  As a result, the install was a little frustrating because the light I really wanted it attached to was a three way setup and this didn't work for that.  Long story short, I ended up putting the switch in a room that wasn't my first choice or in a place where a smart switch made a ton of sense, but its still pretty cool as a novelty device.  The face plate needs to have some options especially if you are putting it beside another switch for something like a ceiling fan and two plates can't fit side by side etc.",4,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0

"Find your neutral wire and connect along with the two live wires from current light switch and the ground wire. My main complaint is the switch itself is very bulky in the back of the switch (what goes in the wall) so if you have a small area in the wall for your light switch, this is going to be a tight fit ... if you can even get it in there at all. Just depends on how your home was constructed. Integrating with phone and WiFi is fairly easy if you are somewhat knowledgeable in connecting to WiFi. Their online support takes forever and isn’t helpful, they will tell you to call an electrician. Once connected, it’s easy to program and turn on/off from your phone. I’ve had a few times where I had to reset the switch (tiny button below main toggle on switch). Overall, pleased.",4,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
This is one of many smart switches that I bought some expensive and some very expensive this one is the most reasonably priced and let me say it was one of easiest to install Had it up and running in less than 30 minutes. Some of the expensive ones I bought had me pulling my hair out because they were so sensitive with the way it had to be hooked up and what they were compatible with. Some of them would stop talking to the app and say not able to connect.I am a TP-Link customer from this day forward planning to install more in my home and they will all be TP-Link Thank you TP-Link.,5,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"Our family is not comfortable with Alexa/Google Home/ Etc, but we still want to have controllable switches. We are slowly changing all of our switches over to KASA switches not only because how well they work, but also for they don't need. They do NOT need a smartthings homebridge, Alexa, or any other extra equipment aside from a smartphone or tablet to run the KASA app.Setup is easy, especially if you have some experience changing light switches and fixtures in your home. It really is just another light switch and goes in like expected.  Once the traditional wiring is done load up the app and add the switch to the list - follow the prompts - and you are done.",5,1,2018-12-31,1,0,0
"Need an auto cutoff timer function? Seems reasonable for a automated and temporary lighting. WeMo offers that but I didn't find it reliable so I ordered this. Although this switch says no hub required, read the description, there is a hub in their smart router and it's only found there. Why would I need it? I could name one of 2 total features I needed a smart light switch for; an auto cutoff timer when manually turned on and motion triggered lighting from a security camera.But no auto cutoff timer without the hub. No hub without an expensive dated router I don't need.",2,1,2018-12-27,1,0,0
"Okay. . I am in the process of installing this. . .and I had to stop what I am doing to go online to see how to separate the plate from the unit. . Why doesn't the instructions say so. Does it just pop out. It is held by plastic. . I don't want to break anything.  (It does pop out -- start from area that has the metal) In addition, it would be nice if they included labels to put on the wires . other manufactures did this. It is not that I don't know that white goes to white, black to black and green to copper -- but the instructions make a big deal about labeling. Also I had one black wire that was looped. . . making it look like it was two black wires going to one screw so I did label it, before I realized it just one wire. . . Also it would be nice if they stated that it doesn't matter which black wire you use -- either one is fine.  That being said, I was able to install both switches in a dual box and they did fit and since I already had a TP plug set up was a breeze.  I put one on my bedroom ceiling fan, and one on my garage light (which I always seem to leave on -- so I am hoping with this I will at least remember to turn it off)",4,1,2019-5-16,1,0,0
"First of all, the installation was hard for me since I realized only after getting this in the mail that the switch I was replacing was a 3-way switch (2 switches that control one light).  Made the install super sketchy and difficult, but I eventually figured it out with the help of an uncle who is an electrician.If you're gonna use this with an Alexa, beware that when enabling the skill, the switch can sometimes say ""unavailable"" or ""not connected"", but it IS connected and will still work flawlessly...(((THIS DOES NOT HINDER THE SWITCH FROM WORKING PROPERLY AND MAY ACTUALLY BE A POWER SAVING FEATURE, BUT FIGURED ID MENTION IT ANYWAYS))) Its strange... If I go into my Alexa app, and view the ""bedroom"" group (which is the group I added the switch to) most of the time it wont show the switch.... Like, Alexa cant see that the switch is connected... but if I tell Alexa to turn it on it works fine... Also, If you want it to appear again in the group for a while, you can go to devices (in the Alexa app) and hit the ""on"" button, which will then register it and put it in the group temporarily.",4,1,2019-1-7,1,0,0
"Update October 4, 2020:Installed second switch in my home, this one for four hanging counter lights. This one was a bearcat, not because of the switch, but because of the way the electrician in his wisdom - or perhaps lack of it - hd decided that the switch should be a junction box. Three commons wrapped together, three grounds wrapped together all smashed up at the back of the box, as well as the hot side for the switch pigtailed off a hot junction. First attempt the switch common came out of contact with the other commons, so second try I needed to use some creativity to insure a secure connection in that mess  Also for the huge ground bundle. In the end, after solving the major wire junction and space fiasco, the switch performed perfectly, and hooked up to wifi fine and integrated with Google Home easily as before.",5,1,2019-1-31,1,0,0
"I have several TP-Link smart plugs and this switch isn't much different. The main concerns are going to be related to installation. First, the original switch didn't have a neutral white wire ran to it, so I had to dig further into the electrical gang box to find it to attach. I found some helpful Youtube videos specific to wiring of this switch. Second, this switch is deep. I had to slightly rearrange the wires in the box to accommodate the switch size. Third, the mount arms / bezels are thick, and might prevent the switch faceplate from fitting flush to the wall or at least it did for me. What I ended up doing was temporarily fitting the switch in place and tracing it on the wall with a pencil. I then took a high speed cutting bit with a dremel tool and carved out the drywall and plastic gang box so the switch fit flush with the surface of the wall. With a good dremel this only took seconds to do vs. trying to do it with hand tools.Other helpful advice. Take your time and you'll have better results. I first tried to install it without recessing the switch and I overtightened and cracked a faceplate. Having an extra faceplate on hand is probably a good idea so that you can finish and clean up your project in one go of it. You can always keep the extra for your next project or return it to the store on your next needed trip vs. making a special trip. Also, I was working in a double gang box – be sure to use a probe for detecting electricity before working on the switches and shut off the circuit breaker or breakers. I had two active circuits in the box and had to flip two breakers.",4,1,2019-2-16,1,0,1

I have nothing terrible against TP product. In all honesty I love this product that they have. I'm sad to say that my house who is not designed with second black wire. Unfortunately I could not get it to function because of that second black wire that is required in order for it to work. I was able to get the device to turn on and Link with my phone but unfortunately the wall unit would not allow it to turn on the power to the lights even though it was getting power. It would be nice if the manufacturer wood design a wall switch that could use the wires that were in my house but there is nothing more that could be done. I hope the manufacturer does reach out to me to offer me a switch that does have a red wire black wire and a ground wire that can still do the same job because this would have been a perfect switch.,3,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0

This is why downgrading to 3 stars.However, scheduling the light works fine so far. The switch runs on and off on time.

"First I would like to say the physical product works as I expected once installed. No Neutral wire? Don't bother, search elsewhere! It was easy to set up in the app and out of the combined 15 TP Link Kasa smart bulbs, smart plugs, smart switch and cameras they have solid connections and never dropped once I replaced the Verizon FIOS Gateway G1100 router with the TPLink Archer 2300. The physical install was kind of hard for me to install due to my wall box was so tiny, inside the metal switchbox my neutral wire wasn't cut and in a wire nut, it entered the box and ran straight up and exited the box. My load wire wasn't cut either, just stripped and wrapped around the screw in the switch.For the wires I had coming out of the wall switch box, I had to cut the neutral wire into 2, along with the load wire and install as normal as per the directions, white to white, all blacks to one of the blacks, and the red wire to the second black wire. My place have old wiring so there was no ground wire and I didn't want to ground the wire to the metal switch box because I didn't know if it was grounded so I capped it off.

"Our electrician was installing some outdoor lights and he put the switch in the basement of the house.

"Bought this switch in July 2018 for my work shop.  Instead of putting in double switches for the front and back doors, I elected to use this smart switch located at the front of my shop, then use Alexa to control the lights from anywhere in the room.  When I first put it in, it worked pretty well.  Over the months though it seems to be having more and more difficulty.  As of now (January 2019) it will not respond to KASA or Alexa.I found a number on the back page of the operator manual to call support.  They told me to hold down the left button at the bottom of the switch for 10 seconds to do a factory reset then add it back to KASA.  Will try this tonight when I get home.",2,1,2019-1-3,1,0,0
"I use this with Google home, and it works flawlessly.  I like that this calibrates the dimming level during setup, which I don't recall the others like Wemo and Lutron doing.  Setup is pretty easy, and keep in mind that you need a neutral wire.A tip with installation I can give you is to not stress too much about knowing the difference between the live and lead wires. The way my wiring is, it's difficult to tell which is which. I had to do trial and error, and reversing the wires will not cause damage. You'll know it's wrong if the lights won't come on...then, just turn the breaker back off and reverse the two wires.",5,1,2019-6-23,1,0,0
"Physical installation is not bad, but you will need some room in your panel as this thing is much bigger than your standard switch.  Then, the rest of installation is via the apps which is very easy.  My biggest problem is that it keeps dropping off from the network constantly, which renders it useless. I have to reset the thing every other day, and I can't do that if I am away from home.  My access point is about 6 feet away, btw. This is a switch, no house design will have an access point next to every single switches.  Network connection needs to be reliable and strong.  I don't know why they don't provide network access via the electrical wire instead of wireless, since it is already hooked up.  There is no need for high speed, but reliable is an important feature, IMO.",2,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"I've been meaning to install a smart switch for some time now to control my outdoor lights and I've always liked TP Link products, I have the smart plug that I use for my living room lamp. It was easy to install, and luckily my house wiring has the neutral wire required for the installation. I also replaced the other toggle switches in the gang box with rockers to match the TP Link. Connection to wifi was easy and the configuration was a breeze as I already had the Kasa app installed. Alexa integration was even easier as it picked it up right away. Currently it's in a timed setup so I don't have to go to my front door to turn the outside lights on and off every night. I'm hoping it holds up well over time. Great product TP Link!!

I ended up having to change Wi-Fi settings on my 2.4Ghz network just to be able to use it.I was a little hesitant to stick with the Wemo switches for regular single pole operation.  I saw these had a very good rating, and went for it.  I've installed 2 of these, and one 3-way switch so far, and the setup each time has been so incredibly easy.  Once I installed it and restored power, it's taken me only about 5 minutes to get this setup, connected to my network, and added into Alexa.",5,1,2018-2-20,1,1,0
"Works great so far, but beware of the LED indicator on the switch.  My SO and I need to sleep in a dark room due to night shifts, and the indicator is very bright when trying to black out a room.  Some people this probably won't bother, but it really can get bothersome for those of you that want a darker setting.  I hope TP Link comes out with a way to optionally turn the indicator off.",4,1,2017-12-26,1,5,0
"I researched a lot of wifi light switches, and debated for a bit on which one's to purchase.  I knew I did not want to spend too much even though I debated on the ecobee for a while ( I have their thermostat) but I dd not need the Alexa feature as I have Alexa throughout my house already.  These seemed reasonably priced and had decent reviews.  So I dove in with one switch and one plug.The installation was straight forward, I have Honeywell automated GFI sized timers for my outdoor lights and these were similiar to install.  Though it ended up tight since I have a 4 switch spot, with now 3 of these in it, it gets difficult to tuck the wire nuts in but is doable.",4,1,2018-8-1,1,0,0
"I bought three of these to convert the switches in my basement from standard to smart switches. The installation was easy: Black to Black, White to White, Ground to Ground. Only one of my switches had this type of wiring.  One switch turned out to be a Three-Way (Two switches in different places controlling the same light, we still don't know where the second switch is).  The wiring for same is Black, Black, White, Pink, and Ground. The other wiring for the third switch has no Neutral (White) wire at all. Once wired in, the setup is easy, and it works great. Just make sure when you decide to convert over, you take the existing switch out of the box (please turn off the circuit breaker first, and there's no need to unwire it yet) and see what kind of wiring configuration you have.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"I bought the TP-Link Smart Wi-Fi Light Switches to control the outside house lights. They are easy to install, about the same as installing a dimmer switch, about 10 minutes. Easy to set-up with the Kasa app. I was hoping for a 'dusk to dawn' option but it seems to need a TP-link hub for that capability. I have a bunch of hubs (Hue, Meross, Schlage) already and  I hesitate to buy another one, so I settled for creating an on/off schedule.My one gripe is that the light switch cover for a double Decora style switch instance does not fit properly over the TP-link Wi-Fi light switch because of the thickness of the plastic tabs which attach the switch to the electric box. It looks like a 'deep' switch cover will work but they are pricey. It would be good if Amazon offer these deep switch covers on the same page as the TP-Link Smart Wi-Fi Switch. Several covers show up but I don't think any of these is the correct cover.",4,1,2018-2-15,1,1,0
Just finished installation with no surprises. I had a deep box with the 4 wires needed so installation was snap and connecting to router and Alexa was just as easy. Now to see if it stays connected.5-3-20.  Just installed my second one. At $40 apiece I didn't find that many places I wanted one. At $20 that changed. Today was a seldom used ceiling fan. Because this one went into a duplex box I had to reuse the original cover plate and ran into the same problem I had with a Wemo switch. The cover plate fits so tight that it interferes with the reset switch and affects normal operation. By enlarging the top and bottom edges the problem disappears.,4,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0
"I'll start off by saying that overall I'm happy with the switch once I got it installed, and it seems to be working great. It integrated easily with my Google home and I'm able to control it with voice commands.However, the installation process leaves a bit to be desired. The biggest issue is that the switch doesn't come with any actual installation instructions; you download the app, pick your device and the app guides you though it from there. That wouldn't be a problem except that you need to be connected to WiFi even before the device is installed, and since this switch was on the same circuit as my modem and router, it wouldn't allow me to select my device and get installation instructions. Luckily, I found a good YouTube video and had it up and running in about 15 minutes.",4,1,2019-9-21,1,0,0
"I just installed this wi-fi light switch today and am pleased with the unit.  I have this controlling two exterior wall sconces that flank two garage doors at a property I own.

I use many of the tp-link wi-fi mini plugs and standard plugs and have been happy and wanted to try this device.  I used push in connectors in the 2-gang box in the garage to make the install go a bit smoother and the switch fit nicely with the existing 2-gang wall plate.I run a unifi network at the property with 3 access points covering the entire property with wi-fi.  I run one SSID on three different channels (2.4ghz) which gives me redundancy in case one AP happens to fail, hopefully preventing any connectivity drop offs to the switch.",5,1,2018-2-15,1,0,0
"the switch housing is large and may not fit in some small electrical outlet boxes, especially if the interior has a bunch of wires. The manufacture also made the switch plate cover difficult to unsnap. I bet a bunch of people break them, at least I almost did, so some care is needed popping it off. The Switch also requires a white neutral wire to operate and in many homes the electricians only run the Black hot wires to Light Switch outlet boxes to save time and money and since most older dumb switches only need the Black Hot Wire to operate. I was lucky and had a three prong electrical outlet in the same 2x4 cavity a couple feet below my light switch box and was able to pull up it's White neutral wire so had a couple hours added work but got the new Smart Switch to work.TP-Link has a app to use the remote on & off feature with my android smart phone and the install and setup went fine.

"UPDATE 07/20:So after having used this for a bit, it's good for simple control which is probably reflective of the price.  They finally added smart actions which gives you the ability to auto turn off the light after a certain amount of time when you turn it on.  However, there's a limit of 3 smart actions enabled at any given time which isn't great.  The Belkin switch is much better for that and allows me to have tons of rules applied.  I use these for regular lights and also for bathroom fans so that they will auto turn off after venting the room, but limiting to only 3 auto-offs makes it less useful if you have multiple switches you need to apply rules to.",3,1,2019-1-17,1,0,0
"Installed in just a few minutes, but took a few tries to get the app to connect to it for setup.  It was likely my phone, but the inability to setup using a laptop could be a drawback for some who don't want to or can't use the app.  Once setup, it has worked well and I haven't had any connectivity issues.  The ability to turn it on at sunset and off at sunrise is really nice, but I wish it could have an offset -- for example, sunset - 1 hour (on 1 hour before sunset).  The other thing that I would add is the ability to setup the switch to connect to multiple networks if the first network becomes unavailable similar to how a phone or laptop will change networks automatically.  I have 2 networks in my house and as it stands right now, if the network the switch is connected to becomes unavailable it will not automatically fallback to my second network.  Instead, I have to manually change it to the other network.  Other than those few things, the switch has worked really well and I have installed a couple more.  It is very nice to not need an additional hub and it is priced reasonably.  One thing to note though, TP-LINK has released hardware version 3 of the switch which changes the chipset for better performance but Amazon is still shipping version 2 as of this writing.",4,1,2018-3-27,1,0,0
"I installed 14 of these TP-Link HS200 wall switches in one day. Everyone of my rooms and garage are now controlled via Kasa and/or Echo depending on which interface I want to use. I love the ""Kasa"" app and the things it allows you to do, but obviously Echo has the Voice Control feature so they are a good pair together. The switch wiring is straight forward if you have ever done any electrical work. Older house wiring may not be compatible with these switches if the common does not drop into the gang box. Also beware these switches take up a lot of space in the gang (wall) box and if there are a lot of wires in the box (plus wire nuts) it is possible the HS200 will not fit without some creative wire maneuvering. If you have never done any electrical work at all in your life - BE SMART - hire someone to install these for you. Don't try it yourself. Electricity and wiring are not for the novice. Don't risk your life or your house.Now a note for TP-LINK if you are listening - I will not ding my rating of these switches - but one thing that annoyed the heck out of me while installing these switches. Annoyance # 1 - how much would it have added to the manufacturing cost and selling cost to actually put retaining flats on the back of the mounting screws so the dang things don't keep falling out. I know you tried to mold the chassis to hold the screws, but trust me it isn't the same and doesn't work. All other switch and outlet manufactures put retaining flats on the back of their screws. Step it up one notch (please). TP-Link please consider the retaining flats on the screws. Love these switches.",5,1,2018-2-14,1,0,0

I have the hardwired switches (2), light bulbs (5), and 2 types of these plugs (7 total).  All of them have been easy to install (even re-wiring my switches) and connect and have worked seamlessly with all of my Alexa devices (3 echos, 1 show and 2 Fire tablets) as well as my iPhone through both the Alexa app and the Kasa (TP-Link's app).  You can't beat the price on all of these products and the quality is top notch!  I like that they are ""Hub-less"" as that is one less link in a chain that can be problematic.  I have 2 of the lightbulbs in porch lights (outside) and I live in an area that gets highs in the summer of 100º and snow in the winter with lows in the teens and have had no problems with them.

"Kudos to TP-Link Smart Wi-F- Light switch. I ordered it yesterday morning with same day delivery. Received it last night. I installed it this morning. It took about 30 minutes to complete entire process. I works like a charm. I programed it to turn on and off at sunrise and sunset. It connected to all my devices with no issues. I even have it connected to my Echo (Alexa). It can be programed to activate on or off at times you wish, at different times and the length it is activated, to confuse would-be burglars. Can be turned on or off manually or by the downloaded app (Kasa).Great product. The reason for only the 4 star rating is because I only just installed it.

If you only have one coax cable with the two wires coming into the box (i.e. the power is coming into the light box, not the switch box), THIS SWITCH WILL NOT WORK.  It only works in a box where there is power in the switch box.  Since the switch itself requires power, I guess this makes sense, but the instructions don't spell that out as such.",3,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"Since this requires opening up/replacing your light switch cover and potentially exposing bare powered leads, I would suggest having this installed by a professional or a high capability handy person.  Obviously make sure power is turned off before attempting to do anything.I have 2 of these switches now (and a few Kasa Smart Plugs) and they've worked great for me.  It is a typical TP Link high quality product so I expected this to be the same.  The installation was straight forward and much easier if you have the Kasa app already installed on your iPhone/iPad.  There is also quite a bit of programming capability so you have quite a bit of control with this switch.",5,1,2018-10-1,1,0,1
"Giving this five stars as I haven't found a valid reason to deduct.Installation was fairly easy and straight forward, everything you'd typically need (except tools) was in the box. The wiring and ""hole"" in my place was a bit tight and that made hooking up take a bit longer than it should, it was no fault of the product though. It works as expected and though it only supports 2.4 GHz wifi, that's not really a drawback. I have my 2.4GHz access point on a different network than my phone and Google Home but both were able to find as well as communicate with the switch.",5,1,2017-9-27,1,1,0
"This is my second review of this thing since I have been buying these and installing all over the house.Relatively easy to install the hardware ( getting the app to connect was not easy at all). After 3 days they started going off line, needed to be reset and added to the app again, which by the way stopped working, now I have 3 connected switches and 2 that are grayed out in the app and it says not online.",1,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"At first I didn’t think I was going to be able to use this switch because I have an older home ( no ground or neutral) but I was able to make it work. I only had a white and black wire and they weren’t wired as hot and neutral. So First, I replaced the metal switch box out for a plastic one. Since WiFi etc could be blocked by the metal box, plus the metal was too small. I just broke the old one so it would fall out. No cutting in wall. Second, I had to re-do the wiring inside the light and switch since I didn’t have a ground or neutral wire. I ended up running the ground wire to the switch and attaching it to the neutral/grounds on the switch, white to Live and Black to Load. The process to quite a while but it works very well. If you have a older home and you aren’t handy with electric work I would suggest sticking with the smart bulbs. However, if you like a challenge it looks great when your done. Newer homes shouldn’t have an issue.",4,1,2018-12-2,1,0,0
This is my third Kasa product. I have 2 of the smart plugs which work amazing.I was concerned with this due to the complaints of installation because of its bulky size. This is true but I have a 6 year old home and really didn’t have much trouble. Getting to the neutral wire was the hardest part because it was tucked and bent way in the back of the box.,4,1,2020-1-15,1,0,1
"Just installed three of these. Not sure why some other brands cost twice as much.  Besides that from some of the reviews, stae that the firmware update causes issues.  So I wont be doing a firmware update.  Besides that, It was so simple to install.  The instructions are so clear. Great wifi reception.  I can now automate all the exterior lights to turn on at sunset and off at sunrise.  No more running around the house or leaving lights on all day because I forget to turn them off. Now the exterior of the house will be brightly lit whenever I arrive home late. Thank goodness for modern innovations. 🙏👌👍",5,1,2020-7-19,1,0,1
"I have a number of different TP-Link switches and outlets and they are incredibly easy to install & setup without the usual frustration you get with many other products and apps. I do not use mine with Alexa but just program them with the Kasa app on my phone. The Kasa app is fantastic and walks you through the install/setup process. I have tried other so-called smart products and most all are horrible to setup and to get them to stay connected.One unique feature for is the ""Away"" setting in which you can have a lamp (for instance) turn on and off randomly during a set period of time making it appear more like someone is at home.",5,1,2018-4-10,1,0,0
"I used this switch with Alexa in a 500 sqft studio apartment with no dividing walls for over a year.Over the course of that time it constantly lost signal with both my Echo device and with my wifi, at least once or twice every month.  3 times i had to reset it and run it through the setup process over the course of that year as well.",3,1,2018-12-21,1,0,1
"I’m an almost 60 year old widow. I try to do small DIY projects around the house. I have four Alexa devices and just love them...mostly for the music aspect. I’ve connected a smart bulb and smart plug to my Alexa system, but this was more of a challenge because the plug needed to be installed. After watching a couple youtube videos on it, I was ready to give it a shot. Took about 15 minutes from beginning to end and I was done. I connected it to the ceiling fan in my bedroom, which I run every night. Now it’s so nice to tell Alexa to turn the fan on or turn the fan off. Don’t shy away from this if you’re not “handy”. Give it a try, you won’t be sorry.",5,1,2018-12-1,1,1,0
"Extremely responsive and works great with Alexa. Unfortunately, I have two complaints.1. The Android app was TERRIBLE. It was extremely buggy and difficult to set up. Now that I have it set up, it works fine, but I was worried I wasn't going to be able to set it up and I'd have to return it for a time. But, if you're willing to fight with it for a while, it works great now! I can't speak for the iOS app. (For those of you more technically inclined reading this thinking I'm probably just not good with technology, I'm an app developer.)",3,1,2017-5-23,1,2,0
"I bought two of these.  The first gave me fits on installation, and had me questioning my own sanity.  The variety of different ways it was failing were amazing.  First level tech support was worse than useless, basically reading a script and being unable to recognize that the script didn't apply.  Basically they kept saying ""must be a wiring problem.""  It wasn't a wiring problem.I gave up on that one, and installed the second one in the same location.  Easy as pie and 24 hours later is still working as expected without any of the errors.  I tried the first one in a different location, and had similar horrific experience (but now understood  that the first one was a bad unit).  Amazon has come through with a replacement for the bad unit and the replacement was also an easy install.",3,1,2018-7-15,1,1,0
"They work great. I was able to set up a routine to automatically turn on the lights in the morning and and when I'm only my way home from work. The only issue I have with them is how much space they take up inside the gang box. If they wired up like a normal switch and didn't add  6 inches of wire inside the gang it would be okay. The size of switch and the extra wire make it hard to fit everything in, especially a double gang box with multiple sets of wires running in/out already",4,1,2018-12-21,1,2,0
"Tried to install 4 times, but always failed to connect in final step.  I suspect this is because of the 2.4GHz limitation, for which most mesh routers dont offer a workaround because you cant turn off the 5GHz network.Really bummed, not just because of the time wasted trying to set this up, or the impossibility of getting support from TP-Link (automated Chat - what use is that?), but because I had had luck with a smart plug made by the same manufacturer, so I assumed these Kasa products worked with mesh networks.  How wrong I was.",1,1,2020-9-29,1,0,0
"Just finished installing 2 switches. Easy to set up. Kaza app on my android smartphone quickly found the switches and allowed me to control the lights from my phone. Enabling this skill on the Alexa app was also easy and the switches respond quite well. I have 3 dots.Only issue so far is that I could not activate remote control on either switch: I get an error message saying the devices had been previously linked to another account (which is weird since I bought them directly from Amazon). Suggested solution is to factory reset, which I have not tried yet. This, however, was not an obstacle to pair Kaza with Alexa.",4,1,2017-8-10,1,1,0
"I have a 4 gang wall plate at my front entry that has all the switches for for the front lights. I installed 4 of these in that box. I AM NOT and electrician but I am pretty familiar with switch wiring (enough to be dangerous). After opening the box and examining all the wires I looked up somethings on YOUTUBE. I was able to get them installed and working. I already had the app because I have a few wall outlets that are TP-Link and they connected with no problems. I really like the TP-Link products. It is so nice to be able to put the lights on a timer, tell Alexa to turn them on or off or control them with the phone app. My wife says I'm getting lazy in my old age and I just say I'm getting smarter.  Great products and easy install.",5,1,2018-8-6,1,1,0
"I was having trouble getting a working smart switch installed in my master bedroom.  This was the 3rd switch I had tried and by far the worst one.  The install was easy, it was working fine for 3 hours then it started strobe continuously, I reset the breaker and it kept going.  There was nothing I could do to get it to stop the strobe.  I was just lucky I am not prone to strokes, someone who is vulnerable to a strobe light could have easily had an episode.  I had to uninstall it at the dead of night and swap in a temporary switch until i finally got a switch that worked (Skylink).",1,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
I use this with a Smartthings hub. Originally Kasa was not supported and I often glanced over their products....until now.Setup was intuitive and painless. Wiring was also equally drama free. I use one of these for my front porch lights and let my hub command it as I can set it up to come on x-min before sunset....this is big for me as usually it is too dark before it comes on.,5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Piece of cake to install and set up. So far no problems with the wifi connection for all but one of my switches. Great to be able to flip outside lights on from my phone when I get home and it's pitch black outside of the house. Also, if I hear something outside, can just push a button on my phone and lights on just like that. Functional product and nice looking as well.Dropping two stars due to persistent WiFi connectivity issues with one unit. In the garage, well within range of the WiFi signal and it pops on and offline randomly. I have full Wifi strength at this location so it isn't an issue on my end. I have heard customer support is non-existent, so I will test in another location to determine whether my unit is defective.",3,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0
"Worked right out of the box. Followed the instructions and was able to get the switch installed and working.  I intended to use this with Amazon's Echo and the only stumbling block I ran into was that I jumped the gun and tried to discover devices before adding the TP-Link Kasa skill to the Echo.  In the Echo app: From the menu, go to Smart Home, then Get More Smart Home Skills.  Search for Kasa or TP-Link and enable the TP Link Kasa skill.  Enter the credentials you will have created from TP-Link.  Then discover new devices and it should find the switch.  FWIW, the TP-Link app has these instructions.Keep in mind that whatever you name the device in the TP-Link app will be what you can ask Alexa to turn on/off.  If I named it Bob's Room, I can ask Alexa to turn on/off Bob's Room Light, Bob, Room, or Light (assuming no other devices share those words).",5,1,2016-11-30,1,1,0
"The Kasa series of smart switches and smart plugs are great connected products. Easy setup, very fast response to commands from either the app or Alexa, and the app has a lot of features for schedules, groups and scenes.This smart switch is no exception. Once installed, it connected to my Wi-Fi network without issue, and works flawlessly. A great way to have the best of both worlds - a physical switch when you need it, or voice control when your hands are full. Admittedly, being a switch, its commands are limited - on and off. But you can combine it with other Kasa devices (in the Kasa app), or with other Alexa devices (in the Alexa app) to automate those simple commands in many useful ways.",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"What can I say it's a light switch... that I can turn on from anywhere in the world as long as there's an internet connection.  So far my favorite thing is to shut off the outdoor lights from the car or turn them on when I get home.Set up is easy though the switch does take up more room than a traditional switch and it requires a neutral wire. Not a problem so long as you dont have old wiring.  To install download the app, select your switch and the app walks you through the hookup and provides safety in the step by step process.  I honestly feel almost any DIY person can handle this so long as you know how to safely cut power to the box and have the right tools.",5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0

"Couldn't be happier.  I installed them 2 months ago.  I have six total including two with the dimmer function.  Other reviewers have said that they stop working after a month.  Every one of mine is still working perfectly fine.  The hardware is easy to install.  The app is easy and intuitive, and as long as your wifi signal is strong, the switch is extremely responsive.  They are super easy to pair with Amazon Echo.  You just register a user name with the TP-link Kasa app, then sign into that user name via Alexa, and then Alexa automatically finds every TP-link device that you have installed.  Super easy.  I've had some issues with Alexa not understanding voice commands sometimes, but this is an issue with Alexa, not the switches.  If I go into the TP-link Kasa app directly to control the lights with my phone, they work flawlessly every time.  I suspect those who are saying that the switches are inconsistently working or not working at all may have spotty wifi issues, or the voice command they've programmed into Alexa may be difficult for Alexa to understand.  You really have to have strong wifi everywhere you intend to install these.  I have a dual wifi router setup for my home, with one router downstairs and another upstairs.  So between these two access points, the 6 switches I have distributed throughout the house work like a charm.",5,1,2019-1-13,1,0,0
"I have many TP-Link home products, various plugs, switches and cameras.  The products work great and easy to integrate with Alexa, but the warranty  registration process is the worse process I have ever experienced.  I don't know if they just don't want you to register their products or they just are just incompetent with the process / programming.  I have complained about this before and it has not gotten any better, despite now having to go to a whole new registration web page (which previous registered products will not carry over too, they will just ""age out "" of from the original site) .First - apparently they don't put the serial numbers in their database, so you can't even start the actual process on the page.",1,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0

"This is an add to my previous review of the HS200 Smart Switch. This morning I noticed all of my outside lights were still on. Then I noticed my neighbors lights were on as well. He liked mine so much he bought them too. I opened the app on my phone and there was no “off time” shown next to each switch and each switch had a green circle next to them,indicating the lights were on.It seems the server must have had a glitch and didn’t allow the off command to be executed. I found the fix to this.",5,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0
"Background:I first experimented with Lutron Caseta for Smart Light integration with Alexa. It works fine, and it was really the only solution that made sense for my 3 way implementation. More recently I have been looking for a cheaper solution. $50 per switch was really excessive all things considered. I stumbled upon this TP-Link Smart Light switch. I was intrigued because it was able to operate entirely without having yet another hub. I purchased one and gave it a try. I have been very very happy with it. I thought it was going to be a one-of oddity, then TP link released the HS210 version of this switch. That will work with 3 way switches!  That means I can now replace all my remaining switches with TP link products. Arrmed with this knowledge I purchased a second one (HS200, not the HS210 kit). Being an eletrical complete noob, I thought I would review my experience.",5,1,2018-1-20,1,0,0
"I have purchased 2 of the HS200 smart light switches. Both are now broken. One stopped working 7 after purchase, but TP-Link said (finally via email) they would replace it. The other stopped working 25 months after purchase, which was 1 month outside the warranty and they have refused to replace the switch. That TP-Link would not stand by their product when it was only 1 month outside of the warranty is awful customer service, prioritizing policies over customers. I asked to talk to a manager, but was not ever allowed to talk with anyone who could actually make a decision. On top of that, wait times to talk to anyone in customer service were really long (30 minutes or more) and they tried to get me off the phone as quick as they could so that they could send me their decision via email—again totally impersonal and an example of policy over people. I will never buy another TP-Link product again because of how both of the switches broke and TP-Link’s customer service was cold and uncaring.",1,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
"I am not an electrician or a DIYer, but I managed to install these switches by myself.  Did I make mistakes?  Yes!  My biggest mistake could have been prevented if I had watched a few YouTube tutorials before I installed the first switch.  How was I supposed to know that when the instructions say wire it to a neutral wire that it meant wire it with ALL the neutral wires?  Once the two switches were installed, I was able to easily connect them o Alexa.

"The wiring was dead easy and took possibly 3 minutes top once I knew what they wanted me to do. Follow the instructions in the Kasa app, as it makes it easy for anyone to do this - not just those with experience.  I had to dig through the questions asked in this listing to find the links for the Kasa support for Alexa or rather vice versa.  In short, make sure you've created a Kasa account in the app. Then with Alexa app, go to the 'add a device' and there is likely a short cut right for Kasa.  Only down side is that the timer doesn't seem to work with Alexa -- I'd love to be able to turn the fireplace on but ONLY for 20 minutes.  The app lets me, but Alexa does not.  Or if there's a way for Alexa to turn switches on/off but with a delay.... I have not yet found it.",5,1,2019-3-2,1,0,0

"This is my first smart switch. It was very easy to install. I downloaded the App and followed the directions. I replaced a standard light switch in a 3 gang box. I was concerned about space as one of the other switches was a programmable light switch for my outdoor light that took up a lot of space in the box. The 3rd switch wasn’t connected to anything, so I removed it and just put in a blank cover. Not sure if I would have had enough room if all three switches were active. However, for whatever reason this box seems to have a ton of wires running thru it, so not sure if this would be applicable in every 3 gang box. Note- you must have a neutral white wire available to connect to the switch. Older homes may not have this wiring.The App is very easy to use and I was able to connect it to both Alexa and Google Home. Definitely considering buying more switches for my home now.",5,1,2018-12-2,1,0,0
"I installed three of these, and those worked perfectly. The Kasa scheduling system is not as intuitive as Weymouth, but. Otherwise I was extremely satisfied. Then I tried to install the fourth. I tried everything, but, when I turned the breaker back on, all the light did was flicker incessantly. Then I tried online customer support. That was a very frustrating experience. First, Kasa subs it out to somewhere in Asia, so the language barrier is not insubstantial. After a great deal of email back and forth, they finally begged off by saying that they aren’t electricians. So I am on my own.  The installation is identical to two of the previous installations, both of which went off without a glitch. I will reinstall the old switch and maybe try this one on another device, but my caution to you is that their customer support for problem installations is subpar.",3,1,2018-9-30,1,1,0

"I own 5 of these now. These are so easy to install, IF you also get some 4-port push-in or spring clamping electrical connectors. Make sure you get connectors that are 22-12 gauge and 4 ports. Most of the time you will need 2- or 3-ports, but in my house I needed 4-ports for some of the wires. Tp-link includes some orange twist connectors, but they cannot handle easily handle 4 wires, and the wires on this switch are twisted strands. My advice is get your own electrical connectors that can handle solid and twisted strands. You'll be done in 10-15 minutes of wiring, and these switches use the app on your phone to configure the Internet connection. That part couldn't be easier. Linking this to Alexa is just a matter of giving Alexa your Tp-link account information. Once you have one, you'll want your whole house connected. I wanted my 3 year old to be able to turn on bathroom lights on her own. It's also helpful for me to be able to turn off her bedroom light when she forgets - every single morning. I love these switches. Get your own electrical connectors though.",5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"Installed easily and connected to my WiFi easily. It connected to Alexa without any problems so we can turn the kitchen lights on and off using the Echo dot. It doesn't require a smart hub, which is good and bad. Since there isn't a hub there are no schedules that can be used to control the lights. It isn't compatible with IFTT either so automation choices are *very* limited. It also doesn't do any dimming. You can buy a TP Link ""smart"" router with a hub in an apparent attempt to lock you into the TP Link walled garden and provide scheduling functions but I'm not doing that. So if you only need a switch that can be controlled on and off with Alexa, this is your ticket. If you want any kind of smart automation I'd keep looking for something that is compatible with more automation apps. I wish Philips Hue had a smart switch.",3,1,2017-12-17,1,1,0
"Having purchased several of these now and paying the extra shipping and duty to bring them to the UK, I can confirm they work perfectly on 220/240v. I had to do quite a bit of due diligence and actually found the original testing certification online and it showed they were tested for our voltage. The only difference is the size of the switch differs from the standard UK. A bit of cutting out of the wall to accommodate these switches, easy with plasterboard, a bit harder with brick or block, but they sit nicely when done. Also they must have neutral to work and most UK lights do run the neutral to the standard source and feed for the switched live. If you can fit these TP-Link switches you will not be disappointed they are fantastic, all fitted and working without WiFi being dropped or disconnected. The Kasa app is brilliant a good easy user interface and it’s nice to have a broad family of products to utilise the app and not have several different apps and products to confuse things. We are using the HS200 light switches and HS220 dimmer switches, the dimmer switches do not have the same shielding for the wiring and you could get a shock if working on them live, highly recommend to put insulation tape over the terminals to avoid for future issues. The UK HS100 WiFi plug sockets are great and we have recently started adding the KC200 TP-Link Kasa Cam outdoor series and again the app interface easy and straight forward. Again the KC200 are not available in the UK at the moment but we were able to add these without subscription easy enough. We have used Sonoff and WIFIPLUG products and they both often dropped WiFi connection and the app is not as good.",5,1,2018-12-26,1,0,0
"Very easy to install and setup. I was a little hesitant about the light on them but it’s so faint that you just barely notice it. Enough to notice in the dark to know there’s a switch there, nothing more. Also like the fact that it has dawn and dusk settings as I use these for outdoor lights since their cheaper than basic programmable switches. Only downside, of paired with toggle switches, they are a little thicker and stick out more than toggle switches so I had to loosen the toggle switches a bit so they extended far enough out as not to appear too recessed behind the cover plate.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0

I finally concluded that smart switches are the simplest, most cost-effective solution. This particular product was as easy to install as any traditional light switch, and the subsequent setup to work with the Echo was incredibly quick and easy. I installed two of these, one for the fan, and another for the attached light, and it works great.I did have to purchase a two-gang plate cover separately though, since I bought two single switches for this application.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,1
"This switch works perfectly and now allows me to turn on my front house lights at sunset and turn them off at sunrise.  The only slight issue I have, which you can see in the picture, is the switch does create a minor gap between the wall and the plate.  Not a major issue but something to keep in mind if you are particular about those types of things.  Wi-Fi communication with the switch is excellent and local control is easy as well:  tap on, tap off.  The wire leads coming out of the unit are roughly 2.5"" and are stranded cable.  They also appear to be slight ""tinned"" with solder.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,1

This came with all the wire nuts you would need, all you need extra is a screw driver and some electrical tape (as extra security between wire nut and wires). App is easy to use, and I love that lights can be on a schedule. I kept forgetting to turn off the front lights in the morning so they'd stay on for days at a time, now I don't have to worry about it :) Perfect! I will probably get a few more for inside so we can control them while on vacation.",5,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
"The installation of Kasa products from TP-Link are pretty straight forward bordering on simple!  But, with these in wall switches, there are some issues.  First, the gang box needs to be pretty deep to hold the switch and the packing in of the Romex cables attached.  Second, the size of the switch itself is slightly larger than the rectangle for the standard ""Leviton"" switch (see picture).  Third, in recent updates to the Kasa app, the ability to see the Wi-Fi SSID and signal strength have been removed.  This information was extremely helpful in troubleshooting network connection issues.  Lastly, would be great if the Kasa app added the ability to trigger events from the cameras to turn on lights!!!",4,1,2019-6-2,1,0,0
"No major complaints, but a few minor ones: Wiring instructions leave a lot to be desired. Thankfully I'm familiar with wiring switches from past experience, but if I wasn't then I would be in trouble because the instructions that come with this thing are poor regarding wiring. Additionally, the switch mechanism itself takes a little getting used to (it only pushes in on the bottom, so it doesn't work like a traditional rocker switch) and if you push too hard then the switch can get stuck ""in"" and then you have to jimmy with it to get it to pop out. Those are my only two gripes. The internet connectivity and app are rock solid. The speed is impressive but that might be relative to internet speed so I can't say everyone will experience that but it's been impressive for me. Overall, I'm satisfied and I really like being able to turn on my front outside lights when I'm not at home.

"pros: works very quickly and easily with setup through the app (you will need the app for installation instructions, it doesnt come with any). a little weird getting used to as the button is always in the ""on"" position, you click the bottom of the switch and toggle it on/off.cons: biggest con so far is that the switch backend (along with all the wires needed to install it) is LARGE. if you have a small electrical switch box or if its a double or triple and already filled with wires, this thing will not fit in it.",4,1,2017-6-27,1,1,0
"I didn't want to get into a whole ""system"" as I primarily wanted this for 1 light so this is perfect. I will echo what some others have said - due to the fact that it has pigtails instead of screw terminals, it can be a tight fit depending on your electrical box, but installing it was a very straight-forward affair (if you've ever done this kind of thing before that is).It works very well. It didnt get 5 stars from me for 2 reasons",4,1,2017-4-6,1,1,0
"When configured, this switch works very well and is almost immediately recognized by Alexa. Many network problems that people notice are most probably resulting from poor home network.

"I bought this to replace an old timer switch for controlling my outside house lights.  I needed something that I wouldn't have to change as the days got longer/shorter and twice a year for daylight savings.  This has perfectly fit the bill.  Installation was straight forward and took all of 5 minutes.  If you have even a basic understanding of light switch wiring, you should have no problem installing this yourself.  Once installed, I fired up the android app, kasa and started the search for the switch.  The first time I tried, the app said found the device, but couldn't add it to the app.  After the 2nd try, the switch was added to the app and added to my wifi.  I was immediately able to turn off/on the switch from my android phone!  Pretty cool. Then from the app, I created a schedule to turn on at dusk and off at sunrise.  The app also shows daily run time, average run time for the week and month.  After the app was setup, I turned to my Echo to get it setup.  It was easy as searching for the skill to enable, and then going into the alexa app on my phone to find the switch.  Probably took 2 minutes total to get it running and responding to voice commands on my Echo.  Overall I am very pleased with this switch and will probably be buying several more for my house.Update March 14, 2018",5,1,2017-3-21,1,1,0
"I used this to replace a timer switch for my porch light and it works perfectly in that application.  With it, I can turn the light on and off based on a schedule set through the Kasa app, or manually with the app or by just hitting the switch.Installation is relatively simple and TP-Link provides everything you need to install the switch including the screws and wire nuts, but if you are not familiar with home wiring and installing light switches, hire a professional.",5,1,2017-11-25,1,1,0
Works well and simple to install if your familiar with electricity or basic handy man work. Many of the 3 star and lower reviews are from individuals who have no idea on what they are doing or didn't read the requirement for a neutral wire so their way of dealing with their ignorance is to bash the product.The unit has FOUR WIRES.,5,1,2018-10-11,1,0,0
"I am currently running 10 TP-Link Switches, 2 TP-Link bulbs and 2 TP-Link smart plugs in my home. I control the devices with the Kasa app and with multiple Echo Dots (voice command) located throughout my home. The switches work perfectly and I have never had issues with them losing connection. I also like how there is an illuminated circle when the switch is off which is great when you need to locate a switch in the dark. They're pretty easy to install, but are much deeper than a regular rocker switch, so you may need to trim down some of your wires. However, I have fit these in duplex boxes with multiple TP-Link switches without issue. I also use these with my standard rocker switch panels. Overall, I am extremely impressed with these TP-Link switches, especially considering they do not require a hub like Phillips Hue and a few other brands. I am literally living like Ironman thanks to these switches.",5,1,2017-9-1,1,1,0

Ugh.... what a headache to install in my multi-switch box. The thing isn't the size of other switches. I had to shim the other switches and cut some of the cover plate to get it to fit. A single switch box install would be no problem but adding it to an existing switch box like mine sucked. I'll not do it again. I had a soft plastic plate I could cut. A metal or hard plastic cover plate is going to look really bad. Other than the install it works just as expected and no issues there.,2,1,2020-9-4,1,0,1
"Absolute garbage product. Honestly had high hopes as it was recommended by Amazon, but there are deadline flaws with the switch. Installed according to mfg instructions (I'm an apprentice electrician so easy install) The switch operates perfectly fine BUT ONLY when i physically press and hold the manual reset switch. All power and wiring done correctly, my wifi is an Eero mesh system so no issues with wifi.. I really wish i hadn't waited so long to wire up the TP Link Switch so i could return  it... instead it looks like I'll have a $20 shooting target next time i go to the range. I have several Leviton smart switches installed around the house and i highly recommend them for smart home automation needs.. This TP Link switch is flimsy plastic all the way around, bulky and difficult to fit in a single gang box, and not to kick a dead horse but setting it up is difficult if not impossible.Stick with Leviton, they cost a bit more but... you get what you pay for.. but that's just my 2 cents tacked on to what i paid for this garbage TP Link",1,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"I have two of these switch installed at my home.  It's very easy to install it took only 15-20 minutes for me to install. There are many youtube videos explaining how to install it. Remember you need the white neutral wire to install this. I think nowadays most of the homes have it. I have both Alexa and Google Home, it works perfectly with both. When the switch is off then there is a small illumination in the switch (see the attached picture) this light on the switch is really helpful at night if you don't want to use Alexa or Google Home to turn on the light at night. I love it!!!",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,1
"I have installed a few of these around the house and they work very well. I haven't had any problems with them at all. The only trouble was just fitting them inside the boxes is pretty tight. The first time I installed two in a 4 gang box and it was really difficult to get them to fit with all the other wiring but I got it done. Ideally if you were building a house you would want to oversize the boxes that would use these (e.g. use 2 gangs out of a three gang box). Anyway, they do fit it just takes some care to do it (excess neutral and ground wires tend to be the issue).",5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
"Works perfectly, and falls back to a regular switch if the internet is out. Their app is very nice and easy to use and integrates well with a lot of other services.Important: This switch is not a typical light switch. A typical light switch mechanically connects and disconnects the ""hot"" wire (the one with power) from the light. For this reason, a typical switch only connects from hot to hot. Electrical installers take advantage of this, and not all electrical light boxes will have all the normal wires (hot, neutral, and ground). Those wires are still connected to the actual light, but not to the electrical box. However, this switch, being connected to wireless and the internet, needs to have the neutral wire. I suspect the people having issues are the ones who are using ground for neutral, which is a mistake in a lot of ways, and is asking for trouble and maybe a fire.",5,1,2018-5-24,1,0,0
"Installing this switch was a bit intimidating, I have to admit.  Wiring anything is a challenge, since so much is at stake.  As an example, burning down the house comes to mind.  However, I am happy to say that all my apprehension was unnecessary once I got comfortable with the process by watching a YouTube video entitled ""Installing wemo and converting 3way to a single pole switch.""  Though I was installing a TP-Link switch, the task was exactly the same.  I quickly got the steps I had to follow from the video.  Those 3-way switches came out quickly, the rewiring to a single-poll was no longer a mystery and the installation of the TP-Link switches was straight forward.  The guy that produced the video has received lots of appreciation from viewers for making the steps very clear and to the point.  So far, the switches are working perfectly, with Alexa as their new master.  Two new switches all done and buttoned up in a little over 30 minutes.",5,1,2017-3-27,1,1,0
"It looks great and functions very well once installed. It uses Kasa app so I decided to integrate my bedroom totally through Kasa and downstairs through Smart Life to keep them separate. The wiring in my house is weird and I ended up having to seek advice from an electrician. Installation can be a bit trickier than it looks if your wiring doesn’t look precisely like the illustrations. I was finally able to make all bedroom lights operate off that single switch, or through Alexa commands like I wanted. It just took more effort than I expected.",4,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
Well replaced meross switch that was a real pain when the power would flicker it would not work so I started looking for a new switch read only good reviews on this switch so I decided to buy it so far so good was easy to install works with alexa and on my Phone we will see if it needs to be reset after a power flicker. It works much faster than the other one linked very fast . One thing that made me crazy was it said that it wasn’t hooked to wyfy so kept resetting and it was linked found out when it came up on my phone pushed button and the light went on and off as I pushed than ask alexa to turn on light and low and behold she did turn it on and off works nicely thank you,4,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"I have been wanting to put my outside lights on a schedule for a while.  HomeKit wall switches are really expensive but these were a great price and fit the look of my existing switches.  I struggled at first understanding how to actually wire these up.  They need power all the time so you need to pay attention to how to connect it.  Once I figured that out, installing additional switches was a piece of cake.  Integration with Google Home is also really nice and is easier than HomeKit for me.",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"I like the switch, it looks like an ordinary switch, and was very easy to set up with Alexa.  The thing is huge on the back, and I had a hard time getting it all the way into the box. I ended up having to rearrange all the wiring in that box, and I still had to force it in, but it did fit.The almost deal killer:  it's not a switch at all. It's a button.  You can only push the part that sticks out, which is normal, but the switch position never changes.  Always the bottom protruding, and the top flush.  I guess I'd rather see the switch toggle, even if the position didn't mean anything, or maybe just have a single button rather than a pretend switch.",4,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0

"These TP-Link devices are just outstanding. I cannot believe how easily and quickly they connect to wifi. This is a replacement for one that stayed on all the time. I did a return and I received it a day early. This one was perfect. I used it to replace an back porch light that was controlled by a photocell. It worked fine but I wanted an LED and I wanted to keep the housing. I bypassed the ballast and got an adapter for a standard base bulb. I also needed it turn off during the time of visitors staying in the bedroom adjacent to the light. I had to stretch out, unscrew the clear bezel, find a towel to cover my hand and pull out a really hot bulb, then screw in the bezel again. Took me forever to get the threads aligned. What a time saver.Also, wanted to thank Amazon for making returns so easy and quick. I have never had a problem.

"Kasa smart switch works as advertised to control a set of lights on a 1-way connection. Remember that you do have to go through the Kasa app and also Alexa app to set it up. Installation a little tricky. I had a 3-gang switch box and the white common wires were hard to locate initially; turned out they were bundled and stuffed behind one of the other switches. Also the adjacent switch was too wide to allow the Kasa to fit, but its metal edges could easily be clipped off. So be patient and be sure you've turned off the power to the switch box before installing!",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"I bought the TP-Link smart switch to replace my wemo smart switch. Where the wemo would periodically lose connection with my wifi router the TP switch has had no such issues. I also like that this works with Alexa directly, no extra ""skill"" need. Installation was as simple as removing old wemo switch and wiring in the TP. I did think the directions in the box were a bit lacking but, still an easy install. They even included nice wire nuts, not the cheap ones that come with some light fixtures. One neat feature of the Kasa app is that you can take picture of the item you are controlling and use it as thumbnail for each switch.

"This is a nice light switch and setup was a pretty simple.  It connected fine to my house internet. But if you want to use it to turn a light on automatically when it gets dark and turn the light off when it gets light, you're out of luck.  In the product description and even in the Amazon Q&A the sellers say it has Sunrise/Sunset mode.  But it doesn't.  I've spent time on the phone with their customer care and then their engineers. What it does have is a timer that turns the light on or off at a certain time.  However, week to week the sunrise and sunset changes so the light ends up switching at the right time, but when it's fully bright out, or hours after it's become dark. I tried connecting it to a sunset service via IFTTT app, but the IFTTT servers are inaccurate and don't deliver reliably, so some nights the light switch just doesnt switch on.  I ended up using the timer mode, which basically makes the whole connected via wifi part of this switch of no use to me.  I would have been better leaving the old GE sunsmart timer in that I replaced to solve this exact issue.  I didn't return it, hoping for some kind of software update.",3,1,2019-1-25,1,0,0

"I bought this to dip my hand in the whole home automation world. Installation was simple and I was able to pair it to my home connection and my Kasa account. The commands are pretty responsive (strobe light party!!!) and the options for scheduling are pretty handy!I have decided to return it, not because the product was bad or defective, but because after calculating the cost of going all the way on TP-Link, it would be cheaper for me to go with a Z-wave system and a hub. Each z-wave module is about $5~$10 cheaper than each of the TP-Link or other WiFi modules. The other con with WiFi is that range could become an issue when you have a module installed in a far away point of your house.  Z-wave works like a mesh, where each module repeats the signal for other modules to find and repeat again. This ensures that your whole house is covered by the hub.",5,1,2017-1-4,1,1,0
"Bought it, installed it (not as easy and wemo), and I returned it. First off, this and Wemo are practically identical in looks and build other than the indicator light design. Actual install was easy. I got this after I had some use with my wemo switch and setting up the TP-link to the internet was way more frustrating. The app though for TP-link seems to have a bit more features than Wemo. But not a deal breaker for me. I ended up returning it. Keep in mind that if your mounting in a multi switch location, the mounting plates are thicker so you will most likely need to buy a new wall plate to accommodate its thickness in order to get it to sit flush. Unless your lucky and you already have them. If not, the wall plate will stick out around the switch and it looks tacky. If it's a single switch location, the plate provided is pretty nice. But unfortunately my locations are multi switch.",3,1,2017-7-20,1,1,0

"I have several HS200 and HS210's installed in my house.  I had them installed by a professional electrician.  He said they installed easy enough.  First problem was the first power outage one of the HS200's stopped working completely.  Unable to reset it, no lights, no nothing.  The second problem is even more frustrating.  These lights will turn off and on randomly.  It happens more often when I have them on and more often on the HS210 but even when I have lights off, sometimes they're turn on and then back off.  Frequently throughout a night if I have lights on, they will turn off and then back on again.Now the even bigger issues is the customer service.  I called in and explained the issues.  For the first I was told to ""check the wiring"".  I said I didn't install them to begin with so I'm not sure what I'd be checking.  Then I was told to hook it up to another light and see if it worked.  There was also some very confusing talk about whether they would send me a replacement because it happened because of a power outage (which is crazy, they shouldn't stop working totally because of an outage).  The 2nd issue was even crazier.  The first answer was try and reset them up in the app (reasonable request), however I told him, I had already done that.  So then the next answer was to check the bulb.  To which I said, ""it's 7 lights"" and 2 of them don't even have bulbs they're LED lights on a circuit.

"After 1 month the switch quit working.  I contacted TP Link for troubleshooting and replacement if needed.  What a nightmare.  After going through many troubleshooting steps to include removing the switch, and replacing the homes original switch, which worked fine, the technician agreed the switch needed to be replaced.  I went to request an RMA, and the serial number of the switch was not in the system, so I could not request and RMA.  Called to rely the issue and they had no clue all the troubleshooting steps had been completed, and all I needed was a replacement switch.  Now I have to wait for another email from them, then try to input the serial number again, and then if that works, I'll get and RMA in 4-5 days, then maybe a new switch 2 weeks later.  This is way too slow, too many emails, too many phone calls, and not worth the hassle.  As a result of my interaction with customer support, I would not recommend this company for any item.

"Great switch.  Easy to install, as long as your electrical box has a sufficiently large volume.  The back of the TP switch takes up about as much space in the electrical box as a GFCI outlet.  You also need space for four wire nuts within the electrical box, since the TP switch relies on 4 wire-wire connections (as explained in Amazon's product description page).The one odd thing is that unlike conventional switches that look similar and toggle up/down like a see-saw, the TP-Link switch's lower part always sticks out and acts like a push button.  You push the lower end to click the switch on and you push the lower end to click the switch off.  Even if you were expecting conventional see-saw action, it would work fine: when you look at the switch and see the bottom part sticking out from the rest of the switch, that's what you'll naturally think to push.",5,1,2016-8-4,1,2,0
"Got these from the US amazon store to take overseas in a 220-240V country, they work flawlessly.

Most difficult part of the install was fitting everything into the box. The switch has a little circle that lights up when it is off so you can see it in the dark. It looks like a rocker style switch but is actually push button. Large rocker switch plates covers work well if you don't line the ones that come with it or like me you have 2 installed next to each other. Once installed and set up it can be operated either manually by pressing the switch, opening the TP Link app with your phone, or by using the Amazon Echo. If the internet is down it works fine as a regular light switch. Overall, I would recommend these as a cheaper alternative to other smart switches.",4,1,2018-2-13,1,0,1
"This product performs exactly as described.  Instructions were easy to follow although they are written only for replacing a single 1 gang switch.  In my install I had a 3 gang switch with each switch controller different lights.  We wanted all of the lights controlled by a single switch. We had to buy a 3 gang decorator style wall plate and a couple of filler panels from our local hardware store (about $10.00)  The only issue we had was that the screw holes for the wall plate that we purchased stuck out too far on the plate to allow the switch to fit correctly.  We easily trimmed the numbs off of the wall plate to make it flush and then the switch fit in perfectly.  After wiring, setup took only about 15 minutes which included doing a firmware update.  Integration with google home was also easy.  Two features it seems to be lacking are the ability to turn off the LED indicator when the switch is off which Not a problem for us but could be for some bedoroms, and there is no ability to have it automatically turn off after running for so many minutes.  The kasa app however does allow you to set a schedule.  so i have mine set to turn off every night at 10pm.  There is also a function in the app to turn it on or off after a specified amount of time, but you have to manually trigger the timer.",5,1,2018-4-23,1,0,0
Like others have said the HS200 switch by TP-Link is easy to set up and install. The KASA app guides you through installation. I like these switches so much that when we were packing for a recent move I removed all of these switches from the old home and installed them in the new one. I then bought some additional switches. The only issue is installing these switch in a 2. 3 or 4 gang box. They do take up a lot of room in the box so you really have to make sure you move the wire connections around to maximize space in the switch box. Other than that minor issue these are great switches.I recommend.,5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"I had some trouble getting this installed correctly due to my lacking knowledge in electrical wiring. I wired the ground and neutral wires from the switch to the corresponding wires coming from the power source, so the switch turned on, but the lights it was intended to control didn't turn on when the switch was on. The fix was to wire all the neutrals in the box together (source, load, other loads) and all the grounds together. Maybe this was a dumb mistake, but the directions in the app could've called it out as a possibility.Other than my slight trouble with the wiring, the install was easy and everything is working perfectly. I use the switch to automatically turn my outside lights on at sunset and off at sunrise, which took all of 15 seconds to set up in the app.",5,1,2019-5-10,1,0,0
"I have purchased, installed and programmed 13, yes 13 of these switches and four TP-Link HS-210 three-way switches.  I did NOT have an electrician do it because for me it was easy enough to do.  BE SURE you know/understand 120 VAC, how your house is wired, and local electrical code(s) before you start.  Having the the right tools for the job is just as important.  Watch enough a YouTube videos to where you feel confident in what you’re doing.  I also replaced all of the 30+ outlets, 6 GFCI outlets, and five plus regular switches.  This has been a an expensive project costing well in excess of $1000.00 not including tools and spent 6 months in my spare time doing it.  I would do it again if given the chance.",5,1,2018-12-16,1,0,0
"This is awesome!!! Connects right to Alexa! Smoothly operated. The regular light switch use is flawless.Installation was kinda fun because I had to watch several YouTube videos on how to install a light switch but if I can do it than anyone can.

"We have a house built in the 1940's and the electrical boxes are smaller than your modern plastic ones. This wouldn't even fit some boxes and when we finally found one in our home that would, we had to ""feed"" the supply wires back out of the box into the wall to accommodate the bulk behind this item. I don't understand why the relays have to be so big on a standard 15A switch. The microcontrollers for IoT of this degree can be crammed into the size of two nickels stacked on top of one another...",3,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
"I love this thing, really easy to install. Download the app first and it'll give you step by step instructions on how to get it installed and set up. Honestly, not sure it could be any easier. You don't need to be a trained electrician but read the instructions carefully. I recommend turning on the lights before turning off the fuse to make sure you turn off the right fuse. Then test the existing light switch to make sure the lights don't come on or flicker. If they are out and no power is running through them, follow the instructions to install your switch. Also, when it is completed, it will need to connect to your wifi, make SURE you know your password. check and make sure before you install the switch. after that, scheduling times for lights to come on and turn off is easy. You can even turn them on from your phone from down the street! I am very satisfied with this purchase. Glad I waited and did my research before buying.",5,1,2018-2-9,1,0,0
"Got this as an intro to home automation.  We wanted to have outside lights turn on at night, off during the day.  With the Kasa app it was easy.  You can choose sunrise/sunset ( I guess it checks the net for this information) or you can specify the time.  Alexa interface is a bonus, as is smartphone control from anywhere.  Now we’re hooked and have started expanding.",5,1,2019-12-7,1,1,0
"I purchased the wi-fi switch to control several LED lights on a single switch in my kitchen. I have been using this product daily, controlled by Alexa, for months without any issues at all.I did have to modify the switch cover a bit as this switch is in the middle of a three switch bank. I had to trim the plastic ""stand off"" tab off the cover to accommodate the ever so slightly bigger switch. It took 14 second with a box cutter.I love the Alexa application and Echo / Dots in my home. Especially when I forget to turn out the lights when I leave the room. I have everything in a ""House"" group so at night I can simply say, ""Alexa shut off the house"" and everything goes off for the night.",5,1,2017-7-13,1,1,0
I now have these in every room of my house. I love it. My son first told me when he started installing one of them that it was frivolous. Two years later he has now started implementing them in his house. All I do is laugh and smile. Maybe I should tell him I told you so. I highly recommend this brand in particular. The customer service is out of this world fantastic. I only had to call them once after buying 18 of their products. And it turned out to be user error.,5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"No complaints here. Started with one (bedroom) and loved it so much i got 2 more (hallway and living room). I’ve got one of those living rooms that doesn’t have lights at all. So, i set up an array of strategically placed lamps connected to tp smart plugs and hooked up one of my smart switches to the nearest electrical box. I then use the app smart actions to use the switch to turn on the connected lamps. Love it.The first thing that comes to mind for additional features is maybe smart actions that allow double pressing or holding for different functions.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
All in all this smart switch meet my needs. I had purchased another brand but its wifi signal could not penatrate  the metal electrical box. No problems with this.Negative the directions are missing from the box and if you do not have access  to the internet when installing you may have problems. their web site does not idenity which  black wire goes to hot and which to load. and it is not marked on the switch. It is indentified in the product pictures which I used,5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"I purchased and just installed this product to have Alexa voice and remote control of my office lights. Overall, this product operates EXACTLY as advertised, almost TOO well! (As it turns out, ANY Alexa device in the house can be used to turn on / off my lights, which means that my family can now mess with me on occasion. (sigh!))As far as installation, I'd recommend that you check and verify that your existing switch's wiring configuration includes a <NEUTRAL> wire to the box. If none is present, this install will be a ""no-go."" Luckily, mine does, so onward! Now, if you aren't familiar or comfy with working around 120v AC, you should leave this to someone who IS. Luckily, both my son and I ARE, so onward!",5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"This Smart Wi-Fi switch works great.  I have three of them, one for front porch light, back porch light and outdoor Christmas lights. I use the Kasa app to set the on/off schedules (on at sunset, off at sunrise), and while I don't use that often, the integration with Alexa works without a hitch. The switch connects via wi-fi, and I have never had a problem with the unit reconnecting if there is ever an Wi-Fi Internet outage, and the unit has never failed to turn on/off via the schedule.  Very happy with this switch.Note that you should be comfortable working with electricity and electrical outlets to install, but if you have ever put in a dimmer before you will be fine installing this switch.",5,1,2018-12-28,1,1,0
Dislike:Unit construction.  It is designed with 4 pigtails to connect to the existing wiring.  All this extra wiring and wire nuts makes stuffing it into the electrical box a bit challenging; especially if there are other wires in there.  It would be easier to install if there were 3 screws for wiring connections as is typically found on standard switches and one pigtail to tie into the neutral wire.,4,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"First of all, the setup ABSOLUTELY requires the use of a smartphone. If you go to the TP-Link website and search for ""Kasa"" (the app for this device) you will find NOTHING at all about it. Zilch, zero, nada, nicht, nyenta, etc. I don't understand why a cell phone is required since I also have a laptop/desktop etc. It says it is compatible with Windows 10, but I could find (again) NO app for it (while using Windows 10).I will say however, that at least it only *requires* access to wifi, pix and NOT to all the other stuff some apps *require* such as: Phone number, Contacts, etc, etc. I just want to connect to a light, or a switch, WHY DO I NEED TO GIVE ACCESS TO MY CONTACTS??",1,1,2017-7-23,1,1,1
"The main thing I like about these switches is that someone on the internet hacked the protocol so you can control them without using the cheesy tplink app.  What I mean is, you can write a program or script to turn the switch on or off however you like.  Search for tplink-smartplug.py.I've set mine up to control my whole house fan.  When the outside temperature gets cool enough at night, my computer tells the switch to turn the fan on, pulling in the cool night air.  I know of no way to have Alexa or Kasa operate the switch based on an external temperature sensor.  I do know how to write a simple program to do it myself.",5,1,2018-6-6,1,0,0
"I had a challenge installing them by myself as I was not familiar with what to do with the neutral wires. The directions show you how to hook up a single switch, but they do not show the differences involved if you are installing more then one in the same box. In my case I was installing two side by side. I called support and they were not very helpful. I ended up watching videos on YouTube from other customers and eventually found someone who had the same situation and that helped me out. Otherwise they work good. The app was kind of basic in the beginning but has recently been updated and is getting better. These seem to go on sale about once a month so check the price history and make sure you are getting a good deal",4,1,2018-12-2,1,0,0
"Just bought the switch, then 5 more. I knew going in that these require a neutral wire, but it sucks that it does. I installed two of these with very little issues and started using them with the Amazon Echo immediately. I am waiting for an electrician (my dad) to come help me install the rest of these in a few months when he comes to visit. I wish the price was less, but I bought them when they were on sale, and had a friend buy more for me since there was a limit of 3. I would buy more again if I needed for other switches, but I think 6 will be all I need for my house.I also bought 4 of the outlet mini's and my review is the same. Little on the pricey side, but will be worth it in the long run.",4,1,2017-9-27,1,0,0
For any room we want a smart light switch I have switched to these as our standard switch. They are great for a location with only one light switch (can't link them for Two or more way setups.) You also have to have power in the switch box.If you only have 2 wires from the light fixture coming down from the fixture box then this (or most any smartswitch) won't work for you.,5,1,2019-12-4,1,1,0

Note, you must have a neutral wire; some older houses do not have this wire and the switch won’t work without it. Control by schedule (Kasa app), voice (Amazon Echo), or the wall switch.  I’ve had no issues with it dropping the WiFi connection.  I would buy this switch again.",5,1,2019-4-30,1,1,0
"Once this was set up, it worked fine, but I had trouble with a couple of things.  First, it's large so you want to put this in a deep box.  It's also wide enough to be a tight fit.  There are other devices like this too, so you should expect it.  If you want to put it in a ganged box, the cover plate may not fit so well so use a flexible plate.  My first attempt to configure it failed, I think because of the way the wifi setup was described.  I'm not sure.  I reset it and started again doing it the way I thought it should work and it did.  Connecting it to Alexa requires reading directions while performing actions so use two devices, one to configure Alexa and one to read what to do next.",4,1,2018-9-10,1,0,0
"First, these work fine with TP-Link's own app.  However, there are problems with Alexa.  I purchased two of these switches.  Both installed without problems and worked great for a few weeks.  Then, out of the blue, one switch quit working.  Alexa shows this switch as ""offline.""  I have deleted it and re ""discovered"" the switch several times and Alexa still says it is ""Offline"" and will not control it.  Of course, the reason I bought the switches was to be able to control them through Alexa.  So, the switch is pretty much useless to me now.Update: Nothing made by TP-Link is recognized by Alexa now.  They work great with TP-LINK's own app (Kasa), but the Echos simply will not see the TP-Link devices.  I have tried resetting ALL devices and Echos, but to know avail.

"I bought this shortly after we moved into our house so I could automate some of the lights for the house and it works perfectly! Install was nice and easy (as long as you know the basics of how light switches are wired) and once I had it setup, I haven't had to do much with it! Only annoyance is when I accidentally bump that switch and toggle the light, as opposed to having a traditional switch. But that's not the switch's fault.",5,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
"This is definitely the best smart switch choice for most people. The product came well packed. Installation was straight forward, I did not use the wire nuts instead I used I-Sure push-in wire connectors. Using the push-in wire connectors, made for a much cleaner and compact installation. I used my android device to pair the switch wirelessly to my router, this operation went flawlessly.

"Quick review - this switch is great. It integrates with my Alexa fine and I have been happy with TP link plugs and smart light bulbs.It was pretty straightforward to install, you need some basic electrical skills and PLEASE double check the power is off to the circuit before you begin.

Now, if the kids aren’t listening and doing their homework, I can shit the TV off while I’m at work, lol. It’s AWESOME!  Kids hate it, but that’s ok. The only reason I would give this a 4star instead of 5 is the switch itself. It’s not a toggle up and down, it’s just down and there is a tiny poorly lit circle that tells you it’s off. In the day in a bright room, it’s hard to see. I would have preferred it to be like a normal switch of this style. If they were cheaper I’d buy more and do most of my house with them. Until then, this is the most important one.",4,1,2018-10-19,1,0,0

I used this to control a fixture with 5 light bulbs, so I save money not buying smart lights but still get all the benefits. Took just a few minutes to install.Minus one star because many times a physical press only registers halfway, so the lights flicker on and right back off. A second press fixes this and the lights stay on, but it's an annoyance. Perhaps it's some issue with the programming, since I normally use voice control for the light. If the physical switched worked the first time every time, this would earn five stars.",4,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0

It took me a long time to realize that the network the Kasa device picked was not my network.  It finally picked my network in the setting up process so I could complete the installation.  It  initially indicated a network's name of my neigbors, so I wish the program gives a warning to check the name on the smartphone's screen being displated to make sure it is indeed the purchaser's network before proceeding with entering the password.  This was confusing.  I thought the initial name being displayed was the code name for the Kasa device. Perhaps screen should say “Found Yoir Network:”",5,1,2018-3-28,1,0,0

House was built in '92. Absolutely love these switches. They have a faint circle on the switch that makes it easy to find and press it in the dark (but too dim to actually cast light in the room so it won't bother you if you're trying to sleep).

I can also use the app to turn the porch light on from elsewhere, which for me means my car.  I park in the driveway (no pass through from the garage into the house anyway), and if I want the porch light on so I can see what I'm doing navigating the porch steps and fumbling for the house key, I can turn it on from the car.  My only complaint with this switch is that the entire setup including the switch plate doesn't seem to match up to the regular switch plate that was on the wall.  So it looks strange.",4,1,2018-10-13,1,0,0
"We love TP Link products. We have their routers cameras, switches outlets you name it. We originally bought these because the front flood lights are activated by a switch in the back of the house... I know right.  With Alexa integration it's super easy now.

"If you were thinking of getting a 'smart switch', GET THIS ONE. The price is reasonable, the directions are extremely clear, and I can't imagine the setup being much easier. I also like that the back of the unit is 'small' -- so it's not difficult to fit everything back into the electrical box (I've suffered devices that are huge which make it challenging to cram back into the box).It seems to me they have really thought through a number of small details that made setting several devices up at one shot easy. Their App is simple, and the Alexa integration is a great plus.",5,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
"Are you tired of having to walk upstairs to start your attic fan?  Want to schedule it to run in the middle of the night when it's cool outside?  This switch was an easy solution for me.  I had the switch installed and connected to my WiFi in 10 minutes.  Integration into Google Home and the app on my iPhone was super easy.  Now all I have to do is say, ""Ok google, turn on the attic fan"" and BOOM!  It fires right up.  I love being able to schedule when it turns on and off with the mobile app.",5,1,2019-9-25,1,1,0
"In general, I really like these switches and they do the job as described.  I have a few detailed comments that some might find useful.1.) I really don't like the connections being 'wires' that come out of the switch that you have to connect to with wire nuts.  This takes up much more space than if they had screw terminals just like standard electrical switches have.  Since the switch itself is larger than a standard electrical switch, the extra space taken up by the wires and wire nuts can really be a problem if the box you are installing it in is short on space.",4,1,2017-1-1,1,2,1
"Mine quit working within the warranty period, but they make you pay to return their broken product, which costs about the same as just buying a new one.  What is the point of the warranty then?

Setup was easy, once I found out that the product had to be registered via the TP-Link app before ""Alexa"" would recognize it.A side note, that even though this is listed as a single pole device, I have mine working in a three way situation.  I bypassed ""switch one"" by removing the switch and connecting the power to one of the load leads with a wire nut.  The other (red) wire I just taped up.  In the ""switch 2"" position I removed the existing switch and replaced with the TP-Link smart switch.

For some reason the tab would only say coming soon for a few days and then one day I opened it and it was available.  I set up the action and it has worked perfectly ever since!",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
I used it to replace a timer system that sort of kept track of local sunset to control my outside lights.  It was a beast to program.  It had a fixed date for daylight savings time which changed and eventually the battery that ran the timer through power outage failed requiring frequent reprogramming Installed the Kasa switch and a very simple Alexa routing and it all works great.  Not effected by political changes in time or momentary power outages.,5,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"I found this item to be easy for me to install and the switch works as described. However, for some reason after the initial installation whenever I manually used the switch it would lose its WiFi connection and I would have to go through the setup process again which I find to be easily done. I solved the issue by manually resetting the switch by depressing the small button bellow the rocker lever and this seems to have solved the issue as I have not had anymore issues with the switch, it works great.",5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"Worked well right out of the box. When it says it requires a neutral, that doesn't necessarily mean a ""real"" neutral.  What it basically means is that this is not just a simple switch that connects 2 contacts, but requires a neutral because it, itself, RUNS on 120V.  In my application I have a 240V transformer splitting into 2x120V pairs.  It works fine connected to those, even though neither is technically a neutral.  As long as you feed it 120V, it will switch the hot side between ""hot"" and ""hot when switched on"", basically.  I used it in my water heater controller.",5,1,2018-1-17,1,1,0
The switch was easy to install.  It is much larger than a normal switch so you need to take care to be sure there is enough room in the electric box for the wires and the switch.  Once installed it was easy to add the switch.  I already had two Kasa plugs for other rooms so it was only a matter of adding the kitchen switch.  It works well with both my Alexa and Google devices.  The Kasa app works well from anywhere I have internet access.

"Now that the switch is working, I'm satified, but tp-link gets an F- on customer consideration. There much vaunted KASA app fails to consider that maybe your installation will be on the same electrical circuit as your router. An easy fix would be a file download of the instructions, but customer convenience, they let you figure out on your own how to install without instructions. That's because their app simply stalls when it can't find wifi. Really, are pdfs sooo hard to make? Or might the KASA app be able to walk you through the setup without a wifi connection?",3,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"I loved the fact that the switch easily connects to my network via wifi and a simple app downloaded to my iPhone.  The operation is very intuitive and works flawlessly.  You need to know a bit about electricity to safely install.  For example, the instructions state that you need a common wire, so you need to know that this is not the same as a ground, even though it will (unsafely) function using ground for common (no different than any other switch needing a common wire).  With that said, it works like it should.  I could not give 5 stars for two hardware/physical reasons.  First, the size is large and takes up every bit of room in the half of my old wall switch junction box.  If only it were just 10% smaller it would easily fit.  So I had to push and shove and could barely NOT get it all the way in because of the clamps internal to the box.  But, it is close enough, I suppose.Secondly, the switch comes with a nice screwless single switch cover plate, and my box has two switches.  Although that is my problem and not the switch's, a standard two or three switch cover plate (which I bought separately) does not fit completely flatly onto the switch due to its design.  I had to grind down the nubs to help it lay flatter.  The screw threads to fasten the cover to the switch are slightly different also.  So when all is said and done, the cover plate is about 1/16th inch off of the wall.  Lastly, you cannot use the screws that come with the switch to secure the switch to the box... they are almost like wood screws and totally pointless.  So you will need to use the screws from your old switch.",4,1,2018-3-6,1,1,0

I also replace a plug with a switch with same problem. I just don't know what to do. Signal are good, in fact 1 of the mesh router is sitting 3 feet away from the plug.

I have every type of light switch kesa has and they work great but there is a problem if you get a lot of them.At first it was great that you didn't need a hub!

I know that there have a router/ hub but I like my router because it's good for gaming.

Love the ways this switch makes my life safer and easier. I can remotely turn on my porch light if I stay away longer than intended. I never come home to a dark house. I also have one hooked up to my ceiling fan so at night if it gets too hot I no longer have to get up to turn on or off the ceiling fan. I don’t have to search for the remote control. Just tell Alexa to turn on the ceiling fan!,5,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0

"I can't say how much I love these light switches. My alarm company wanted over $100 to install a similar product which would also definitively tie their usefulness to me staying with the alarm company indefinitely. It's so handy to be able to set timers and create ""scenes"". For instance I have outside lights on a timer for when my wife gets home from work. I have the garage lights set to be on about 5 minutes prior to when I normally arrive home and turn off about 10 minutes after. Or I have a ""scene"" for when I arrive home at night so that I hit that scene and my front outdoor lights, garage lights, and entryway/kitchen lights all come on at one touch of the screen on my phone. Very handy and useful item. Also, it was very easy to set up. The app walks you through wirelessly connecting the switch to your network once u have it physically installed.

I set a timer on the app to turn off every 1230am. Now I fall asleep to fan and it's off so she doesn't get a stuffy head. Win-Win.

I installed it in my pool equipment control box on the side of my house to control my pool light. The main reason I got this switch is be able to turn my pool light on and off remotely. The app for controlling it is super easy. I can turn the light on from my phone anywhere I have a signal. I also set it up with my Alexa so I can say ""Alexa, turn on the pool light"". It is really cool. I bought two more switches and have put one of them on the pump for the waterfall in my pool. Note: This was installed to control the relay for the pump.

Or have it on when I'm downstairs and ready to go upstairs. Since then, I've added a switch to control the porch lights which is now set to automatically track sunsets, and for the office and the dining room to provide a one-button solution to turning on all the lights when I get home.Installation was a breeze. I have a house that was recently remodeled and rewired so I had no issues with grounds and neutrals. The fixtures I have are simple single-pole lights so it was as straightforward as it could be. I think I had more difficulty in getting it to see my wifi if only because I don't broadcast the SSID, so that had to be done all manually.

I live in an area that I have to change routers at least twice a year and the outlet has always been so easy to repair it. So I bought these switches and I love them.

Wemo plugs and switches really have been hot and miss in this regard, while the TP-Link devices always work. Always!",5,1,2019-1-27,1,0,0
"First of all, once you get this setup, it works great. I now have 3 outlets and 2 wall switches.The biggest problem with this switch is that it that the housing is too thick compared to other switches in the same switch box (see photo). The result is that the switchplate cover does not fit flush to wall (see photo). I dread the dread the day my wife notices this.",4,1,2018-7-24,1,0,0
"I love the plug and switches, I wish you made an in wall plug so I don't have a wart on the wall. The dimmer would be cool too. I'm happy you guys finally fixed the app so I don't have to reset my devices after every code upgrade! Scheduling features are cool. If you could have them follow daylight that would be fantastic so I don't have to continually change the on and off schedule as the seasons change. Google Home integration and IFTTT would be fantastic too. I know you say Google Home integration is coming but I 'd like to know if there is even a tentative when. I'd like to get more of these throughout my home but that's a holdup.I'd also like so see the ability to connect this up wo a 3 way switch setup. My home has 3 way switching everywhere and It'd love to replace that without removing all the switches. So we still have physical access to switches when we need them and still have the automation capabilities of the switches throughout the house.",5,1,2017-3-24,1,0,0
"The instructions with the device refer to an IOS app that does not exist.  Going to the support web site, the same thing.  The IOS app shown does not exist.  I finally found a KASS application to work with to at least have the device turn a light  on/off. After a lot of trial and error I found out how to get it to turn on at  sunset.  I came very close to sending it back.  There is no reason to purchase this device given the difficulty of getting it to work.Don't miss the need for a ""Neutral wire"".  This wire is not usually connected to the light switch that is being replaced.  It is topically available behind the switch under a wire nut.

Easy to use but may take some time to get used to install and set up at first. Only con would be the light when it’s off but I use it with a fan so I keep it on turn off using the fan remote.

"These switches started a much larger project than I intended to undertake because they showed me just how easy it was set up home automation. They allow you to use an app to turn them on/off, monitor their status, control multiple at once and even have an ""away mode"" that toggles them on and off at random to make it appear you're home. Buy a smart device like an echo and these things really shine, commands like ""Alexa, I'm home"" can turn on specific lights and commands like ""Alexa, I'm leaving"" allow you to turn off all the lights at once so you don't have to wonder if you did or not after you've left. If I had the need I'd buy a dozen of these. As it is I'm loving the 5 i do have.",5,1,2018-5-3,1,0,0
This is a nice looking switch that was very easy to install. I was a little nervous when no instructions came with the switch but once I downloaded the app it had a step by step installation program in the app that made it very simple to fallow.

Installation is very easy, with the Kasa app providing illustrated instructions.  I gave it 3-stars because I paid for a new item but mine was clearly open-box and had already been installed at least once.  I know this because the Kasa app tells you the total time the switch has been on and mine already had 16 hours of use.  Some of the installation hardware was also missing.  Just be aware of this when you make a purchase.",3,1,2017-10-11,1,1,0
"I'd give it 5 stars but the price remains high, so it gets a ding there.  the kasa app isnt super simple, but if you poke at it you'll be able to get through the setup. once setup it works well most of the time.  a little weird and it takes getting used to that the rocker doesnt rock, it just clicks, which makes sense given that you want alexa to be able to click it also.  I set this up for my daughter so she can turn on the lights without being scared of the dark, and it works great for that.  install is about the same as for a regular light switch, which may or may not be a warm fuzzy for you.",4,1,2018-7-13,1,0,0

"This switch will not work with the most common type light switch wiring.  Most switches are wired without a neutral wire.  Check your wiring, if you only have a ground wire and two others you cannot use this switch.  Most switches break the line wire, and a neutral isn’t required.  This switch requires a line wire a load wire AND a neutral wire. (It also has a ground connection).

The other thing I like is you can just touch the switch and it turns on and off as well (if you don't want to yell an Alexa command).One warning...it will not work if your current switch doesn't have a ground wire (nearly all wall switches do, but just check to be sure.",5,1,2018-1-15,1,1,0

The wifi notification light on the front lights up (the round thing in the picture) lights up and stays lit up at night and is actually very bright. Amazing for use in hallways and such, but rapidly becomes an issue in bedrooms if you like to sleep with your room as dark as possible. Secondly the button is very sensitive, and you will find yourself double clicking the light on and off when you are in a rush.

I won’t tell you what to do - you should call and electrician. Here is what I did, though. I turned off the breaker so that I did not take the chance of shocking myself. And then I found all of my white wires for all of the switches in that box wire-nutted together in the back of the switch box. I took a new 10 inch piece of white shielded wire that I had, and stripped & wire-nutted one end of it into the wire nut that my other white wires were in. The other end was the white wire I needed for my new smart switch. I hooked up my white wire and my two black wires and my ground wire to the Correspinding pig tail wires on the smart switch.

Works well but mounting tabs TOO THICK for standard wall plate so stuck with plastic one that came with it that does not match rest of room.  Picture shows the switch I am replacing that was older technology X10 switch that had metal tabs which are thinner thus allowed for standard switch plate.  If I used my standard plate i would be able to fit something fairly thick behind the switch plate.  It would look less than desirable for a $30 switch.  I will be looking for a different brand for the long run.,2,1,2019-3-8,1,0,1
"I have purchased 2 of these and installed them on switches for the security floodlights at the corners of our home.  I wanted to be able to turn on these lights from the upstairs and/or basement levels, but the only switches were on the 1st floor.  The switches were easy to wire, since I had accessible commons in both switch boxes, and easy to set up for remote access.  My only quibble is that the face-plate housing could be thinner and the visible switch part extend forward farther, so that the installed unit will cosmetically align better with other switches in the same box once the cover plate is replaced.",4,1,2019-2-4,1,0,0
Decent product and not to difficult to install.  Lousy customer service.  Had one defective switch and it required jumping through endless unnecessarily complicated loops to get it replaced.  No one speaks clear enough English to have a conversation with and they ask the same question over and over.  If everything works good its not a bad product but don’t count on any assistance if you have a problem.,3,1,2018-12-13,1,1,0

"First of all this wifi enabled switch works just as expected and was very easy to set up once powered on. The smart functionality is great and was very easy to connect to my google home devices.However, what is not displayed on any details given by the manufacturer, this is not a standard sized switch. The plastic not only extends further out from the wall than a normal switch but it also is a few mm(s) higher than a normal switch. Normally this would be fine if used in a single gang outlet, but will not work in any dual or triple gang setups. When trying to place the wall plate over my two switch setup I am not able to get it to fit without being both crooked and misaligned. I will be trying to modify my electrical box to accommodate but I will likely return this device as it may not be possible to make it work.",2,1,2018-10-31,1,1,1
"Using it with Amazon Echo to voice control the house.  The back of the switch is BIG and was difficult to fit into the wiring box, though I did manage to shove it in there with a good deal of effort.  It probably won't fit in some boxes.  Having said that, the WiFi works very well, and it is easy to use manually by pressing the button as well.  There's a light on the switch that comes on when it's off so you can find it easily in the dark.  It's not bright, but it might not be ideal for bedrooms.  The button is a bending press button, not a toggle, i.e., when you press it, it goes back to the position it was in before you did so externally (I'm sure there's another switch on the inside that's toggled).",5,1,2016-8-23,1,1,0
"The TP-Link HS200 wall WiFi wall switch is a very good choice for a 'smart' wall switch using the free TP-Link Kasa app or Amazon Alexa technology and is much less expensive than many other similar switch technologies.  The installation is straight forward by connecting the wire connections using the Kasa app prompts to install the device.  The switch is accessible via a 2.4G wireless connection either remotely after establishing a free TP-Link account using a user ID and a password or locally with the WiFi connection without logging into the Kasa account.  For those who are do-it-yourself individuals and are competent performing household electrical and WiFi connections the installation is a breeze, just ensure proper electrical safety measures are followed.",5,1,2016-12-3,1,0,0
"I have a total of 5 tp link smart switches and one smart dimmer installed in my condo. They have never disconnected from my wifi network, they look sleek, and were very easy to install and setup. I have them connected to my Google Home but we like to use the switches when we are walking from room to room. We use Google Home voice commands when we are in bed or on the sofa or leave a room and forget to turn off the lights. We love having the old school option of actually using a switch and not just voice commands.",5,1,2018-11-9,1,0,0
Works great with an easy to use app. The onscreen install instructions that pop up in the app the first time you open it are easy to understand. I knew how to wire a light switch anyway but they were nice to see. I have it working in connection with my Alexa devices for voice control of my lighting. The Kasa app is also great for turning the lights on and off without walking to the switch. Connecting it to my home network was as easy just follow the app prompts. It also works like a traditional light switch just push it to turn on and off if you want.,5,1,2018-9-5,1,0,0
"I have several smart switches in my house to turn on and off lights and fans using Alexa. I'm not an electrician, but with the instructions and some basic knowledge, installing them is fairly easy.

"I was replacing an old Belkin Wemo smart switch that just died on me.  I like TP-Link products (business and personal), so I thought - why not.  Let's try this light switch to control the porch light.  I'm very comfortable around electrical stuff, so it wasn't difficult to install.  The software setup.  Even easier.  Downloaded the Kasa app.  Connect my phone to light switch wireless.  Fire up the app - finds the light.  Connect to home wireless.  Firmware update.  Setup my schedule.  Done.  It works.  I even went as far to turn off the wireless for a few minutes.  I see the light switch disconnect.  Start the wireless up again.  The light switch reconnects with no problem.  That's all I can ask for - something that works.",5,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
"Installation was a breeze, works well with alexa, had an issue with connecting it with the iPhone vs Android, not sure if other ppl had that issue. But using Android with alexa was simple.

No issues at all with switching between the two.",4,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"Tech support is Awful. I called with a question, they just said you need at least 3 wires, then they told me it wouldn't work. They wouldn't help any further or really even listen to my question. Apparently they can only read the FAQ. I had an electrician friend come over, it was simple and worked as I had assumed.The switch has been working as expected since. The first night the Internet went out for awhile and the light went off later than it should have, then came back On in the middle of the day. I did the Reboot and it's been fine since.",4,1,2017-3-20,1,0,0
Bought with the Alexa show and some smart plugs for my wife because she always forgets to turn the lights off when she gets in bed and having Alexa do your bidding when you’re all cozy in bed is so much better.

"Great product, but poor choice of over plates. Because this switch comes with a snap on, screwless cover plate you con only use it in a single switch box.

Already have a handful of Kasa smart mini plugs. Wanted to try out the wall switches too. I installed myself (41yo female). Easy install and wifi set up.

"After reading so many great reviews I decided to purchase one.  The installation was simple, and the feel and design of the switch is excellent.  I use it to light up my outdoor coach style lights from dusk to dawn in front of my home.  The app works well and it allows me to program the switch and do many settings.  I was using a digital timer switch before that was less expensive but I hated adjusting for time changes etc.  My needs may different from yours but I highly recommend this switch.",5,1,2017-11-9,1,1,0
"Kasa branded switches and plugs have been the most stable of all the brands I'm running in my house. Their installation is straightforward. And their online videos offer good support if needed.

And by far, the Kasa/TP-Link products are the most reliable.",5,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0
"It the TP-Link switches loose wi-fi, you are doomed. Most smart items will regain their connection when wi-fi resumes. Not the TP-Links! The switches will just flash a small light to let you know that the switch has lost wi-fi connection.

There are no YouTube videos showing how to reconnect either.",1,1,2019-4-16,1,0,0
I use this for my front light. Got this after two other digital timer light switches failed. You can turn light on and off manually with switch or control remotely with free app. App allows setting schedule. I use the sunset/sunrise schedule and it works great.

"I don't care much for messing around with electrical stuff and this didn't change my mind about it at all.  The reason for 4 starts instead of 5 is the design of the part that has to go into the electrical box.  There's a part of the unit that really sticks out pretty far in the back (compared to normal outlets) - and that has to get shoved into the electrical box along with all the wires in there and that was tough.  Now that it's in place (after many attempts) it works great - no complaints about how it operates.  I love the fact you can operate the switch manually, via Alexa, or via my phone.  Over all it's a good product - I just didn't like the installation part of it.",4,1,2018-5-3,1,0,0
"Easy to install and connect, but requires a neutral wire to actually work. Unfortunately, the switch that I wanted to replace only has a live, load, and ground, as is common in older houses. Some posts online have mentioned getting it to work by connecting the neutral to ground, but others explain that that's dangerous, against code, and can void insurance claims.So, my advice is to check your switch/wiring before buying. If you don't have four wires (live, load, neutral, and ground), you're going to need an electrician to run another wire, to install it safely.",4,1,2018-2-18,1,0,0

"Great product to control multiple lights from one switch.  Your home must be wired with neutral wires for this product to work.  Note that the device is on/off only, and if your application requires dimming, you will still require the purchase of individual lights.  I bought this one to control three lights as an alternative to buying three new bulbs, as it is cheaper than three new CREE bulbs.  If I want to dim these three lights, I'd need to get the bulbs, though.  I bought a second one to use as a remote switch to control porch lights as a security measure.  Works great and easy to install if you have any home wiring knowledge at all.",5,1,2017-4-20,1,0,0
"The only problem was removing the face plate on the switch.  It is attached really tight and you should sort of push it without breaking it.  Other that minor thing, everything is great so far.  Make sure that you have a neutral (white) wire and two black wires in your switch box. In most cases the neutral wire is attached to to the neutral wire (the one going up to the light) in the wall directly.  The black wire (hot) from fuse box attached to switch at one end, and on the other end another black wire goes to the light.  Download the app and it will guide you.",5,1,2017-1-24,1,1,0
I've zero electrical wiring experience and was able to install this switch on my own on the first try. I love how it looks; its very minimalist and clean. It's a single button that toggles the power on and off rather than a lever switch. I like how there's a little glow on the switch so it's easy to see in the dark. I use it with Google Home and it responds to voice commands flawlessly.,5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"Good product is all respects so far (connectivity, ease of installation, aesthetics) except for the cover design.  Rather than the typical two-part design where the faceplate is screwed into the switch and brought flush with the wall, the faceplate actually has small plastic arms that grab the switch component from behind.  The switch has to be slightly out from the wall in order for the arms to reach around and lock in.  In my case, this has resulted in the faceplate also being slightly detached from the wall, so that the whole mechanism sort of floats and is not totally flush with the wall.The problem is worse if the socket box is crowded and you'd like to use the faceplate to push the switch in as you screw it.  Could be corrected using screws, or some other technology that I haven't thought of :)",4,1,2016-10-28,1,0,0
"I am remodeling my home and as an electrician, purchased these switches instead of installing timers and controls, I put these in so I can program on and off times with my phone from anywhere. The only thing I wish for the app’s sake is grouping multiple switches to one set schedule. As far as I’ve seen, you need to make a schedule for each switch separately. I purchased 3 so I had to make up three identical schedules for all switches. It only took an extra 5 minutes, definitely not a reason to avoid the product.The existing boxes in my house are metal, which are a bit smaller in height than newer plastic boxes which made it very tight for these switches. They still go in, just with some persuasion.",5,1,2018-5-6,1,0,0
"As far as installing a light switch goes, this one is pretty easy. It would be nice if all these products that say ""Alexa compatible"" could be connected through the Alexa app (but that's more on Amazon than the manufacturer).What takes a lot of getting use to is that the physical button is in the off position of a typical light switch and it is used for both turning on and off.",4,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
Love the ease of installation (if you have a neutral wire available).  Took 15 minutes to get it up and running and its all integrated into the same Kasa Account.

"This was part of a larger project. When I finally got to wiring the switches, I noticed my house only breaks the load side of the circuit at the switch box. The neutral doesn't come down to the switch box, so I can't run this switch (not without some major in-wall rewiring). So, just be sure you have a neutral wire in the box before you order, especially if your home is older than 25 years.Other than that, the switch is nice, and very easy to install.",4,1,2018-10-30,1,0,0
"For aesthetic reasons, I was only interest in hardwired smart switches, and this product fit that bill. The fact that I did not have to buy an additional hub was also a huge plus. In general, the product works as advertised. Unfortunately, three of its limitations have been more than a bit frustrating in my home. First, the installation requires a neutral power line - something that some of the switch boxes in my home (built in 1994) do not have. Second, due to the size of the unit, it is not supposed to be installed in a multi-gang switch. Third, although I have not personally tested it, online blogs and the installation materials warn that the switch will not work properly with a 3-way switch setup. When you combine these three limitations, there are only 2 or 3 switches in my entire home that are compatible with this product. Despite the installation warnings, I am currently looking for a multi-gang faceplate that will fit this switch (it is too big for many options and the faceplate cannot be metal) because having that option available will allow me to install the switch in a more convenient location. I have given this product 4 stars under the assumption that I will be able to locate a multi-gang faceplate that will work.",4,1,2017-4-19,1,2,0
"You can't beat the price. It's very easy to connect to alexa (it also connects well to Google - if that's your thing). Two issues.First, be warned, the switch is pretty big. You'll need to push wires around to make room, otherwise it won't close properly.",5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
Overall this product works great.  It is a bit bulky and the plastic mounting tabs stick up a bit so a normal wall plate may not sit flush (you need to either get an over-sized plate or cut back your drywall a bit so it sits back).  Make sure you have a neutral wire though -- and you need to wire it into the neutral wire bundle if there are a bunch wired in together....I'd like to get a few more -- waiting for them to go back onto deal of the day!,5,1,2018-12-18,1,0,0
"I think these are great but I had a circuit breaker trip last weekend and it took out a den and all backyard lights.  I could not reset the circuit, it would just trip immediately.

"I used this to replace analog timer switches that I had on my porch lights.  The analog timers were a nightmare to program, would not work with LED bulbs, impossible to synchronize, and had to be constantly reprogrammed as the day length changed.  The TP-Link switch was relatively easy to install and program. Best part is the Kasa app allows you to set the switch to go on at dusk and off at dawn.  Automatically adjusts to day length.  Easy integration with Alexa.  Set it and forget it.  Just make sure you have a neutral wire in your box.  I had to rewire one of my switches to get it to work.  Best part is that it works without a smart home hub.",5,1,2017-6-10,1,0,0
I have installed a great many TP Link switches throughout my home and have 'Zero' problems with my devices. These Kasa products provide seamless integration with my Amazon Alexa network.

I have had two of these for a couple of years now. Works great with Alexa or Google - we use both! I only wish they made it with a normal light switch instead of the rocker switch. Easy to install but bulky. What you name it in the app is what you'll say to Alexa or Google. The app is so easy to use.,5,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
I like the way it is integrated with Alexa and the timer function.  I used to own Insteon products but their software was so bad I ripped them all out.  For the second go around I decided to go with a company familiar with networking.  I only wish you had regular toggle light switches instead of the press at the bottom type.  The other short coming is the choice of white or white.  Some other companies offer different colors or replaceable covers in different colors.  But all in all I bought the switches for the automation aspect and that works very well.,5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"installation process was pretty straight forward. connecting to the wifi took a couple tries but once it was connected it works smoothly.  connecting to Alexa was a breeze.

"I purchased two of these devices as a trial run before updating all of the switches in my house. One of the devices installed without any issues and worked perfectly. The other device turned on the light one time but would not work after that to control the light. I tried to troubleshoot myself with the limited info online, reset the device, uninstalled from the app and reinstalled, verified that the light bulbs were functioning correctly and not burnt out, and even though the device was successfully added to my app, I could never get it to control the light.I called customer service for help and was incredibly disappointed with the level of service. In the middle of troubleshooting on call #1, I was told to verify that the wiring was done correctly, and in order to do that, I needed to turn off my power. I was told to hang up while I did that because it was going to tie up the help agent and that I would be wasting his time sitting on the call.",2,1,2018-9-3,1,0,0

You could also set timers for it and that's great! But on the downside, the installation was trial and error.

How many times have you gotten in bed and forgotten to turn on the ceiling fan? or turn off the lights? Or perhaps you are like me and don't want to get out from under the covers with the fan on!  This is your answer!  I love it!,5,1,2019-12-3,1,1,0
"It was my first light switch of any kind to install.  The instructions helped.  The biggest challenge was getting all the wiring pushed back enough to allow the switch to fit. The switch has more depth than a normal switch.  Other than that, I’m so glad I added this switch.  It is so much easier than controlling 4 smart bulbs that sometimes don’t behave.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"Looking at the different wifi switches, Kasa seems to be the best for its price. Installing it took me the better part of an hour, but I feel it only took so long because it was my first time and I had to switch out one of the previous lights in a row of three switches.The Alexa integration and wifi signal worked quite well, but I noticed that there is a warning that metal may block the signal emission. As I am using a metal faceplate, the signal from the app did not connect at first, but manual adjustment of the faceplate got it into a position where signal connection was fine.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,1

However, I'm still really pleased with the Kasa app functionality when paired with the switches and plugs. Have a few of each setup throughout the house, especially exterior lighting, and so far everything is working as expected. Really happy that I spent half the money on the wireless light-switch than I would have on new exterior lighting with the scheduled on/off functions. Also a lot easier to wire up, no ladders needed.Only gotchas I would relay to people considering these switches are:",5,1,2017-2-2,1,0,0
These work super! Use it like a regular switch or set up any schedule you like for on and off. You can be on vacation and still turn your lights off and on from anywhere or just let the switch do it for you! Just set it...and forget it! Regular lighted or Christmas lights or whatever plus bet if all...NO HUB needed!

Does exactly what it says it will do. I have many TP-Link smart light bulbs so I figured it would be easier to stay with the brand and not have to download another app. So far I've had zero issues with it. It was easy to install and it updated itself with not issues once the setup was complete. I have a google wifi mesh network and that did not present any problems. I've only had it a week but I will update my review if I notice any issues in the future. I'll definitely be updating a few more switches with these.,5,1,2018-6-12,1,0,0
Good product and it integrates easily with amazon Alexa. The app is very easy to use too. Wiring was easy but when it came to fitting the wallplate that has two other switches it became a little difficult. This switch is a hair larger than your regular decora switch (the tiny two buttons make it so) so I had to do a it of maneuvering and it still doesn’t look that great.,4,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
Very easy to install and good instructions although the instructions implied some tags to help identify the wires that weren't included. This is a minor point. The loss of one star is because it doesn't quite fit in a three switch frame like ordinary switches would fit so it bends the frame a little bit. Interface is very easy to use and set up was a breeze. Only caveat for this product is if you're replaceing a manual light switch in a multiswitch frame.,4,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"It was super easy. I bought two for my bedroom to see how they work, I had these two switches installed in less than 30 mins. The hardest part was stuffing all the wires back into the gangbox.Once I got the switches installed, the linking to thr kasa app was seamless. I did make a mistake when I initially set them up on Kasa and named both switches the same because I wasn't certian which one went to the fan and which went to the light. Once I figured which was the ceiling fan, I deleted the remaining switch and did a physical reset on the switch. Once it was deleted and reset, the re-linking of the switchurch wentry without a hitch.",4,1,2017-2-1,1,1,0
"Got two of these for use with Alexa.  After trials and tribulations along with a lot of positive contact with Support, it appears that the switch programming app, Kasa and the Motorola Moto X Pure phone do not play well together and we could not get the switches hooked up.  Kasa app is not available for PCs or Kindle Tablets.  The potential was great, but neither of the switches will connect.  The Motorola phone is about 9 months old and the netgear wifi router was new this summer.",1,1,2017-9-22,1,1,0
Packaging and look are excellent.  Download the Kasa app and follow instructions.  Installation step by step instructions were easy to follow.  Then came programming.  This operates on a 2.4ghz wifi only.  My wifi is multichannel so I had to make sure my phone was connected to the 2.4 before i could get this to work.  Don't count on tech help from TP-Link if you have problems.  I called and found only one person with a script working on a Saturday.  That was frustrating but I kept turning the system on and off as well as resetting it.  Eventually got it connected.  Then the rest was easy. Set an on off schedule.  Connect to Alexa. All easy and I just bought outlets to get everything hooked up.,5,1,2016-9-10,1,0,0
"I now have three of these switches in my home (all shipped and sold by Amazon.com) and they all work flawlessly.  Replacing the conventional switches with these was easy (with proper tools and prior knowledge of house wiring).  Setup over Wi-Fi worked without issue using the Kasa app, integration with Alexa was painless.  I setup schedules for some outside lights to turn on at sunset and off at sunrise (so the actual timed event ""slides"" as sunrise/sunset changes) and it's worked great.  Alexa also happily controls them.  So far, so good.  I'll update this review should anything change.",5,1,2017-8-10,1,0,0
"So the switch works fine, pretty standard wiring and configures easy enough.....my issue is that for my purpose, this is one of the switches installed in a two gang box.  The tabs that attach this switch to the box are substantially thicker than the tabs on the standard rocker switch.  This causes the wall plate to come off the wall a little more than 1/8"". The gap can be address with caulk - but its something I shouldn't have to do.  The TP link device comes with its own deep recessed wall plate, but they need to understand that not every installation will be in a single gang box - nor would I want a deep recessed wall plate when every other wall plate in my house is or standard thickness...Good functionality, Poor design.....",3,1,2018-2-10,1,1,0

"This switch installs easily with basic wireing knowledge.  You will need to tie it into the nuetral wire in your switch box.  It’s “deeper” than a normal rectangular wall switch, so it may be tricky to stuff all the wires back into the box when remounting the switch.  Also the switch sits a little farther from the wall, so your existing switch plate cover may not for quite right.

"Great product. I will purchase again. It was easy to install. Just follow the directions that came with the box.Update:  I've purchased more and have updated the switches in my home.  It is very easy to install and I like it that I can control the switches remotely, schedule the timing when I need the lights to be on or off, and set the timer to how long you want the lights on.  The set up is so much easier once you set-up one.  The app is connected with my Alexa so it also helps when you don't have your phone with you.  You just need to ask Alexa to turn on or off the lights and it is done.  You can also group the lights together.",5,1,2017-4-22,1,0,1

Very simple setup, and the status light isn't any more intrusive than a standard lighted wall switch. The only pain is having to have a neutral wire, but if you're wiring this up new, that shouldn't be an issue.

"Works great and was easy to add to my existing TP-Link network of smart outlets. **A disclaimer... Not responsible for your your wiring setup or install; if you have no clue hire an electrician. : My wiring install took a little longer than it should since I have installed this on a three way light setup (front porch and driveway lights) that have a switch in the house and one in the garage. The MOST important thing:Turn off the power AT the Breaker box!!! The next is you need to ensure you have a common wire (usually white) or the HS200 will not work! (see the notes on the amazon description). I had to dig in the back of the two switch box and fish it out took the most time (had all the joined commons of the light fixtures). This process of moving the already cramped box was a pain. My wiring setup had one red wire, two blacks to the switch. You will need to determine what black wire stays hot (usually labeled ""common"" on the switch). The hot black goes to the black on the HS200, the red went to the other black, ground to green, and white to the aforementioned common that was jumbled in the box. *VERY Important: you must leave the other switch (if you have one) to the on position (or complete the circuit if you want) to get the power to the HS200!  And the next longest part is the final cram: the HS200 is pretty sizable I had to cut and clear some of the extra wire and re-bend in the junction box (there was a lot) in order to get the HS200 into it. I included a picture to show how my jumble of wire looked. Again, your wiring may be different, and if you don't know what to do get help from a pro... I used to wire houses and ""many things"" for the military, so I have a pretty good knowledge. Also check out the Q and A section under the product. The user ""spinnern"" said it as good as anyone can say in regards to how to determine a setup. But you don't know how your wiring is until you open the box up.After the wiring, it was all easy to add the switch and test out via the Kasa app and add the new switch to Alexa via the Alexa app. If you dont already have the Kasa app or Alexa control enabled this will take longer since you have to make an account, add wi-fi network, etc.",5,1,2017-3-7,1,6,1

"I had no problem installing the switch and the app works fine, but the switch looks awful when used with a double wall plate because it's too thick.

"This thing worked great for about 8 months. Then, randomly, it started losing connection to my WiFi. Reboot, reset then finally factory reset several times each time it happens since there is no way to get it to connect again. Their iPhone app is extremely buggy. Every time there are different issues. Finally, lost connection again and the app won't even recognize I am on WiFi (even though I could log in), it's terrible.

"I almost never write these, but this product is great so far. I travel for work and my home is often unattended. I have video cameras, but I also wanted the deterrent of my home appearing occupied while I was away. I was able to literally watch my home lights come on via my camera system, within seconds of turning them on remotely, on a plane, over Greenland. My house is in California. How cool is that?It was super easy to install and set up. I’m not good with wiring. In fact, it makes me nervous. But this was so simple, I had no reservations about it. The WiFi bulbs are also great for lamps. I hope this company keeps up with great products and doesn’t decline as so many do.

Two smart switches out in the garage. My only issue was the signal in the basement was weak. Certainly not a problem with the product. Like I said my router was a long way away.

Otherwise, I'm happy.",4,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
Never worked correctly.  I used to be able to control it from the Kasa app... never from Alexa. Can't use it with either now.

"These work well with Alexa but DO NOT fit standard wall cover plates. Beware if you have a multi-gang swith ot switch-outlet you’ll need to modify the standard cover to fit these plugs.

Works great most of the time.This switch does require power to it all the time to maintain the wifi connection. So if your power comes from the light fixture, it won't work for you. If you're somewhat handy and have access it isn't hard to rewire. I'm sure there are other work arounds but I just rewired so power went through the switch first.",4,1,2018-3-9,1,0,0

The associated app is basic, wish it had a few more automation features and easier access to usage history, but I use it with Alexa and won't knock a star off for the app since that is common to most wifi devices.  as far as the hardware and integration into my current system, I have no complaints.",5,1,2019-8-16,1,0,0

"One switch lost connection one time but thats about it. Works good so far. Except that I still have 2 switches left uninstalled, just because my specific switch in the kitchen doesn’t have a neutral, and that’s because my house is old.

I love this product. Kasa has worked well for me since I started purchasing their smart products. I have their plugs prior to this but this was my first smart switch. The switch was very easy to install and looks great. I find the switch to be much more responsive and easier to use than the smart bulbs. I will be converting my whole house to this product eventually but will probably wait for the next sale.,5,1,2018-12-30,1,0,0
I have been making my entire house smart. I did the lights individually because I wanted color changing on the ceiling fans. But the back porch is hooked up to the patio lights. So a switch was needed instead of a bulb. Hooked up with ease so anyone could do it. Love it.,5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0

Would love it if it worked consistently. Set-up was pretty easier although it was a tight squeeze to fit into the recepticle given the depth of the switch. It loses connectivity to my WiFi on a regular basis and resetting it is a pain - requiring removal of the switch plate to access the reset button. Hope they can make this product better.,2,1,2017-3-22,1,3,0

"What can I say.  It works as it should and never fails me. Integration with Alexa is flawless.  I'd buy again.

I have to admit I’m biased. I have a bunch of Kasa outlets and they were super easy to setup unlike other brands that’s had tried.  This Kasa switch did not disappoint.

Once installed, setup was quick and easy and the response is near instantaneous!

"Wiring was a pain, but once I finally got it installed, it worked great. I will say that the installation instructions in the Kasa app are pretty good, but unfortunately my house wiring was not exactly like that described in the app. I still use the switch most of the time, but it is really handy to be able to turn the lights on in a dark room using Alexa or when entering the room with my hands  full.

A luminescent circle on the switch makes it easy to find in the dark.  The only reason that I'm docking a star because it stopped working at one point and I had to do some Internet research in order to figure out how to reset the unit (it's a tiny button under the switch).  I've had no problems since, however.",4,1,2016-8-21,1,3,0
Used with a dual light switch and this takes up a lot of space. The previous small standard switch was flush now the switch sticks out.

I suppose I can't really say much about the physical switch itself as I use it with Alexa (Amazon Echo) but for me it works great.

Eventually used a very simple 4 character password to get it to work. Then had to sync it with Alexa. I got a tplink smart plug and was pretty much a breeze to install, kasa already setup with a simple password and alexa integration straight forward with alexa already synced.

I like the Kasa app. It is easy to understand and user friendly. Installation was simple for me but then I have done a bunch of electrical work. I had to cut some of the wires shorter in the junction box to fit this switch in. That's common though because most electricians leave lots of extra wire. It would be better if this switch was a little smaller but it is workable.,5,1,2019-3-19,1,0,0
I would have given this a better rating but just for the hour of suffering I’ve gone through trying to get the switch plate on that’s impossible to install. Well no stars for you. The switch itself was easy to install. you'll need to download their app and create an account. you can then enable the Alexa skill to get it to work by voice command.,2,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0
Have been using two of these for the past month or so. Easy to install (my skills are no where near electrician level). I bought these because I wanted voice control without having a buy an additional hub. Works seamlessly with the various Google Home's and Google Hubs I have in my house. Will probably be purchasing a few more of these soon to replace various outlets!,5,1,2019-3-19,1,0,1
"I got this to replace a simple switch.. & the price was good so I thought I'd try it out... Literally the hardest thing about installing this yourself is fitting all of the wires back into the switch box. Those thick wires are really... really stiff. Besides that, it looks super clean & it's only controlling one hallway light so I actually don't use the scenes or anything.. that's what my LifX lights are for. Still though, if you want to get into the smarthome game & you don't want to pay too much this is a perfect tester for that.",5,1,2017-5-1,1,0,0

I had the installation and software done quickly with no issues.  Then i waited two weeks to see if problems will pop up.  To date, no issues.On the critical side, the instructions are not clear.  I happen to be proficient in wiring and knew what to do.  It might be intimidating for someone without experience.

I usually read all the bad reviews on a site to see what problems are being reported with a product.  I usually base my buying decision off those bad reviews.  This product was cheap enough that I went ahead and bought a couple to test for myself.  I have been using them going on a year now.  They were fairly simple to install and I have never had any issues with functionality.  They just work.  I see all the bad reviews and all I can assume is that these people either got a bad switch or they are having other issues (maybe network related) and are blaming the switch as a result.  I just had to write a review and give it 5 starts.,5,1,2018-11-8,1,0,0

They also fit with my existing faceplates, so they only look marginally out of place next to standard rocker light switches.The only reason I didn't rate these five stars is they don't support Apple Homekit out of the box.

"Got one of these to try out - am buying more!  It's easy to install (or get the installation) and it lets you control the lights either by the switch or alexa.  I've gotten the plugs as well, but this is by far the better way to go.  It does require the Kasa App to link to alexa, and I'm not keen on adding apps for everything, but TP-Link Kasa was pretty easy to maneuver and if I wanted to now, I could control my light from my phone.The only thing that was a bit different is that it is not a typical rocker switch (push up to turn on, down to turn off) - I was afraid it was broken when it first came.",5,1,2018-1-27,1,0,0

The ones that work have worked flawlessly but TP-Link needs to add Scenes to be accessible by the Echo devices, not having scenes or not having their product function with IFTT, or Smartthings, or Harmony Hub, or Yonomi, or Stringify.

The product is easy to install and connect. It comes with everything that you need. The connection from the app to see the devices in Samsung Smart Things is slow sometimes. The biggest problem I have is with the Kasa app. It does some really great things and has neat functionality. What really got me is that you can only have three smart functions active at a time. I have 5 switches installed and I have even started outfitting my house yet. I don't understand the limitation.The Kasa app has some easy functions that smart things doesn't do so it is annoying not to be able to use the smart functions going into the future.,3,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0

"I purchased the TP-Link HS200 to replace a mechanical light switch timer that I had been running for several years. My setup is fairly simple: I have a porch light which I want to turn on at dusk and turn off at 10:00 p.m. The clock on the mechanical switch would slowly drift so while the switch did work, it was never as accurate as I wanted. I spent about a day researching the available options and the HS200 seemed to have the best reviews and provide the best value. Even if it didn't work correctly, it was fairly inexpensive. Since the unit connects to WIFI, if it worked, then it would fit right in.I purchased the HS200 to replace a mechanical light switch timer controlling my porch light. I was looking for something that would provide greater accuracy than the mechanical switch since the clock would drift considerably. I have been using the HS200 for about 3 months and it has been great. Setup was simple and easy to connect to my wireless network. Programming took almost no time using the mobile app, and now I just let the switch turn on and off automatically. Given the price, this is a great value if you need a simple switch timer. The only thing to consider is if your overall plans for home automation. At some point I may add more light switch automation, and I am not sure that TP-Link will provide the best integration. That being said, I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a simple light switch control.",5,1,2016-11-20,1,0,0
One of the best smart switches on the market.

My only complaint is if you are installing these into a multi-gang box with another switch, where you have to use a trim plate that screws on, there is no support for the screws.  I solved this problem by taking a tab off of my old 97 cent switch and placing it behind the TP-link switch.Also, if you don't see a neutral wire in your box, make sure you look in the back.  Often times the neutral wire is in the box with a wire nut and jumpers up to the fixture.

My main complaint is the Kasa app. I had been using it for weeks and found it very limited, even exploring third party apps such as IFTTT to control sunrise and sunset lighting. Only until my 3 year old had gotten a hold of my phone did she uncover a secret part of the app that allows for scheduled activities. It would be nice if the app itself, which by the way is the only automated way to control this device was more intuitive and not a sly sales pitch to buy more WiFi products from TP-Link.

"I hooked it up to several different lights hoping I had a neutral wire. Ended up putting it in the garage instead where I knew that new wire were installed and had a neutral wire. For a DIY project, if you have a neutral wire it's stupid simple to install. You have to own a smart phone to set it up (or iPad), but after that its easy.Now, if the manufacturer would get off their rear end and make it so that you can install without a neutral wire, I would spend the money to make my house automated.",3,1,2017-3-19,1,0,0

"Did a lot of research into what switch to buy..namely one that could connect to Alexa.  Bought this one, installed, easy set up, easy to link to my Dot and Tap. Works perfectly. Just download the mobile app for remote access.  Will be buying plenty more.UPDATE: I've now bought and installed three switches. The setup was even easier after doing the first one.

The installation wasn’t that difficult, it appeared as I watched him do it, but he’s used to doing things like that so maybe for your average person it is, I don’t know.  Either way once set up I do not regret it.",5,1,2018-1-16,1,0,0

Fantastic.  Installation was a breeze.  The problem was connecting to the Wifi.  Took about an hour and couldn't figure out why it was constantly disconnecting from the wifi.  Finally realized that I had tightened the bottom screw mount too tight and it was permanently depressing the reset button.  loosed the screw and it connected and setup without further problems.  Works flawlessly with Alexa and the scheduling feature is awesome for when on vacations.  Wish I can scatter these around the house but most of my switches are 3-way switches.,5,1,2016-12-12,1,0,0
I love the functionality of these switches but they are kind of cheaply made. When i had one i loved it and then installed them all over. I have trouble occasionally with pressing them and the light not coming on and having to press them again.,2,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0

"Works flawlessly. It never explains how to remove the beauty cover. I had to google it since it feels like you’re going to break it off. The wiring was easy and the app walks you through each step which was awesome. My wife loves having both the voice control and physical control (that you don’t get with smart plugs or smart bulbs).

After the switch connects and is successfully set-up, you can then go back to hiding the SSID. I hopes this helps.We like this switch better than the other brand we tried because cosmetically it is cleaner / sleeker. The only time there is something illuminated on the switch is when the switch is turned off and then there is a small, subtle light ring that glows. Its not as bright as the picture would suggest.",5,1,2018-11-16,1,0,1
"Between bulbs plugs and wall switches I would choose a wall switch if it all possible because, although they require installation by someone who knows what they are doing... they are the easiest to use. If you have a lamp plugged into a plug chances are, 99% of the time, that lamp has an on-off switch. People turn off lamps without asking Alexa. A wall switch can be turned off or on manually without affecting its ""open or closed"" state.",5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
The switch has trouble keep a connection to the network. I'm a tech professional and have ruled out all my equipment being the issue.

Great product so far. Installed 2 of them - 1 to control the 2 lights on our front door and 1 to control the lights outside of our garage.

That being said, I'm a retired IBEW48 electrician and feel that this would be very easy for someone to install the switch as long as theres a neutral wire in the switch box.

Wires were user friendly. Instructions could be a little better. However using the app was Great. I linked this brand with Nest and it works awesome.

Worked great in my application. I wanted a switch that I could control from my phone and set a timer schedule for. Followed the video on YouTube to install.

They are fairly easy to install (I have zero experience with any kind of electrical work prior to this, just watched a couple of quick YouTube videos), easy to connect to your wifi through the app, and a very user friendly app interface. The only things preventing a 5 star rating is the fact that the lre is no dimming capability and the wires are connected in to the switch permanently, so you have to use wire connectors (which come with the product) to install the device in your wall (instead of just connecting the existing wires in the wall to the switch via a screw). This is not a big problem, but it makes fitting everything into the wire box in the wall more challenging since the connectors take up space. Once you get everything in, you're golden.",4,1,2017-11-18,1,0,0

I chose these switches because of the innovation TP-Link has made with smart homes and use of the switches without a hub is great.  The Kasa app is easy to configure with the switches.  I have installed them in every room in the home.,5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
My electrician installed this successfully. My big problem is that I cannot connect it to Alexa. I have tried everything. So I have another on off switch.I do not recommend this unless you are super wi-fi savvy and do not have a problem with an unsecure wi-fi signal in your home.,2,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
"This thing is pretty great from a stand point of use.  Installation however was a nightmare, the housing for the switch is made of a thicker plastic, which i had to cut into and modify to get the switch cover plate to fit flush to the wall.  Wifi Set up was fairly easy and works with google home.  fairly expensive, but the piece of mind for turning a porch light on and off is really nice.",4,1,2018-4-18,1,0,0
"I so love this thing. I have the little plug in ones that go into outlets, like all over the house, but I needed a switch one because I have a light thats hard wired. This thing is awesome. It works perfect, i love the led light on the switch so you can see it in the dark... yes, even though it can be voice controlled, (alexa can be a pain at times... if you have her in your life, you know the struggle), and it looks nice. I highly recommend this.",5,1,2017-8-2,1,0,0
"So, my first changing a light switch and getting a look at the wires behind the wall. From turning off power at the breaker, to bring able to use the voice command and setting a schedule took ten minutes. I can operate this manually, by voice and by timer.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
This is my first smart switch.  Wanted to have my outdoor lights go on without having to turn flip a switch all the time.  Switch went in with no problem.

"I have had this smart switch installed for 3 weeks now and it is great. It is used for the front porch light and for the amount of travel we have done this summer, it has nearly paid for itself. No more leaving the porch light on for days. Now, I can simply create a schedule and have it come on and off whenever I want. Plus, I no longer have to trudge downstairs to turn it off each night.",5,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0

"Easy to install, comes with wire nuts and the Kasa app walks you through the installation. The only thing I had an issue with was there wasn't enough room in the switch box for the device to fit. I didn't realize the foam pad could be used to space the switch out an extra 1/4 of an inch. I took it out and added the pad and it fits just right now. Easy to configure, no smart hub required, runs on my WiFi and works great with Alexa, I love the TP Link products. I think a few bulbs might be needed next.",5,1,2018-3-6,1,0,0
"I bought this as a part of a home automation project I am doing with in-wall switches, plugs, and plug-in plugs. It works extremely well, and the Kasa application that goes along with this device works perfectly, You can set routines, group them, and the response time is nearly immediate. This works well with Alexa too, and it was very easy to pair them to my home WiFi. I'm very happy with the purchase, and will continue to purchase TP-Link devices for my home.",5,1,2016-12-30,1,1,0
"Easy to install, great app, adds fantastic smart home functionality. I have four of these scattered around my house and am trying to convince myself to fork out the cash for some of the three-way switches as well. Works great via their app or with Google Home/Amazon Echo/IFTTT. I also have these working great with the Logitech POP to essentially turn single switches into three-way switches (the POP went on the opposite wall and toggles the switches). Can't recommend enough!",5,1,2018-5-3,1,0,0

"We bought this to use with our Amazon Echo. It was easy to install and easy to use. We've since added a TP-Link Smart LED Bulb to our stairs to eliminate the need to fumble with a switch at night.

Only took a few weeks to convince them it was dead and another week to get it.",4,1,2017-10-1,1,0,0
"Following wiring instructions per Manual and Youtube, tried to turn the lights on but they just flickered once and would not stay on. I checked several times to make sure the connection including Neutral wire are connected. The switch didn't work in manual either. Repeated factory reset 3 times without any success.

"The only issue I have had was with the install. It's just a bit bulky, so I had to really organize the wiring in the electrical box to fit it. The app is decent. Has built in things to schedule on/off and you can do voice controls with 3rd party apps. The connectivity with other stuff is the best part, lets you control it with what you want, not just the software they give you",5,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0
"Works great.  I use to turn on/off outside lights.  Easy to install, but a bit bulky so it can take some effort finding room amongst the wires in the outlet.  Works with Google Home and Alexa.  I have it installed on Google Wifi and had no issues connecting to WiFi.",5,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0

"The switch keeps disconnecting from the WiFi network and is “unreachable” from the Kasa app. It is also unusable manually to turn the lights on, because after about 20 seconds it automatically turns them off. I have deleted the switch from the app and reinstalled it many times, studied the settings, troubleshooting and FAQ’s to no avail. Useless waste of money. I feel cheated.",1,1,2018-9-5,1,2,0
"We have four of these switches throughout our home and we absolutely love them.  They were easy to install and set up!  Thank you for this great product.

"Awesome!!  Can now remotely turn on/off lights either through the App or Alexa or Alexa App.  Can also set up different programs per day if desired.

No longer have to come home to a dark house if we leave during the day and return late.",5,1,2018-1-17,1,0,0
The light Switch is easy to install and I have a number of them located throughout my home. They work well with Alexa and the Kasa android app. They do require a neutral wire so you need to be aware of how the wiring in your home was installed. The are a number of installation videos on the TPLink web site and other locations on the web. These switches are ideal for those who are not fully ambulatory. You must have an internet connection for the switches to work.,5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"This product works well and does just what it should. We have several TP Link smart items in our home (bulbs, switches, outlets) and they all function very well.

Would definitely buy again.",5,1,2018-6-20,1,0,0

I went to get the manual from TP-Link's site and they were not very clear as to how to proceed with my home's wiring.

I love all other TP link products but not this one. There was no way to wire it if you have a neutral. I wouldn’t suggest this item if you’re in a home built in 1954. I believe that TP link should fix this then they would be batting 1000 in my book. I just can’t recommend this one product to people who have older homes.,1,1,2018-12-13,1,0,0

"Easy to install and setup. Problem is, it's dropping the wifi connection all the time.  When I first installed it it worked great for about one month.

Well from the kasa smart page it says dimmer! Clicking on this takes you to this item so I just bought 3 of them! should have read closer before I did this but on their page it clearly says DIMMER!

Otherwise everything was easy to setup and works fine as just a switch!!,1,1,2020-6-11,1,0,1
This is a really tight fit some junction boxes.  My box had the tabs on the top that were held in place with short screws but they came into the box by 1/8th of an inch or so.  The housing on the HS200 was too tall and did not fit in the box so I wound up cutting away some of the plastic to make it fit.  A hack I would rather not do.,2,1,2017-11-6,1,1,0

Once installed these are great.  However you are required to have a neutral wire at your switch location.  This may be typical now in new home builds but is not in most homes built 10 years or longer ago.

Programming allows device sharing.  But Kasa too stupid to factor that in.",2,1,2019-2-3,1,1,0

I was finally able to get the wires in the electrical box out of the way to get it flush. This is my first smart switch, so I have not compared to others. The cost did go up $15 since my purchase, so I am not sure I would say it is worth the cost now. It does work well with Alexa.",4,1,2018-1-2,1,0,0
I installed these in my wife's studio (and studio porch) and on a set of LED string lights for the garden and elsewhere.  Once I did the first two - I realized their use for so many other places!  (I'm still buying more - like the garage light I always forget to turn off).  If you can wire a light switch - you can wire this.  The App is simple and integrating with Alexa is as simple.

"I really like these switches.  They are very easy to set up.  They work with Alexa and the Kasa app.  I can't remember once having to reconnect these to the WiFi.  I have the plugs and the bulbs and have lost connection on the bulbs more than the others.  If I had my wish, these would come in two and three switch options.  The two switch option would be great for rooms with lights and fans.  The cost should be to add an additional switch.  You wouldn't have to add additional WiFi circuitry.  I'd give it 5 stars but there is no circuit drawing with these.  I'm an engineer and figured it out but there should be better wiring instructions for the DIY'er.",4,1,2018-1-11,1,0,0

It took me about 15 minutes to wire this switch in and about half that amount of time to get on my wifi network to integrate with Alexa.  Everything works great and as advertised.

"Let's start with the lesser issue.  The design sucks.  It's designed to look like a toggle switch, but it's really only a push-button switch.  The only way the switch itself indicates that it is ON is that a dim LED goes OFF.  Did the designers think the switch would only be used with lamps?The bigger issue is the reliability.  I installed this switch in my home in Colorado so I could control it when I am in Mexico.  When I originally installed and tested it, it worked fine.  When I came down to Mexico and tested it, it worked fine.  Now I am still in Mexico and need to turn it on.  ""Device Unreachable"".  WTF!  I can still access my networked thermostat in Colorado, but not this switch.  I asked my son to drive over to my house and check.  He rebooted my router, to no avail.

Installed them with help of an electrician... Connected to the app which we need to download in 2 min. Can't be faster. Amazed with the response time between the phone and the switches. No lag time when tried on wifi or in cellular signal from phone. Added simply to my Google home on top of the ease. Only question which I am waiting to see is that as they work only under 2.4ghz wifi signals .. if one switches to Google WiFi whether it will take it or not.,5,1,2017-12-4,1,0,0

My opinion on this product is exactly the same as I have posted on their smart plugs. It works great. The Kasa app is easy to configure and has a lot of options.  You can control from outside your network if you want or set it to internal control only.  The only reason I docked it a point is that there is no native Windows software for it.  I have successfully run it in BlueStacks but it was a pain to get working.,4,1,2016-8-16,1,1,0

Will be buying a lot more of these to replace my existing light switches.",5,1,2017-10-23,1,0,0
I installed 7 of these in my house over the past couple of days and giggled with glee as I made an Alex group with all of them and turned all the lights off with one voice command. I love it!

Customer support has been good, not great, switch is wired correctly, but I cannot get it to work. Frustrating...anyway, I also own several T-Link smart lights and plugs. Both the lights and plugs are awesome...easy set up...easy integration with Alexa...and I love setting up scenes....one word though...there are two variations of the bulb. The more expensive  bulb can be set up in Circadian rhythm...the light changes intensity and temperature throughout the day. Great for an office application. The less expensive bulb has to be set up manually for intensity and does not have the ability to change temperature. Both are great and easy to use; however, the more expensive light has much more capability and is worth the $10 extra dollars.",2,1,2016-11-12,1,1,0
"I installed this switch on outdoor lights connected to a 20 amp circuit for better or worse, although the circuit does not see too much load. The installation was simple, if your have previously installed other electrical switches or outlets. I had a terrible time getting the device to see my wireless network however. Yes I was running 2.4 wireless 10 feet from the device, but it simply would not see it. Finally, I discovered the reason. My wireless network was not secure. I live in a remote area, my nearest neighbor is quite far away, as a result my home network is not secure to keep things simple. Well, this switch will not connect to a non-secure network. I logged into my wireless AP and setup a secure network and the switch connected right away. Took me hours to figure this out!!! Bad documentation!!!

These can only be used on simple circuits in your home. I found out the hard way that this can't be used on circuits with more than one 3-way switch. ie if you want to control lights upstairs that have a switch both upstairs and downstairs that control the same lights. I'm sure if you pay an electrician he can rewire but I couldn't figure out a way to remove/disable second switch to make this work.

I can't really rate the performance of this since I did not actually receive the correct item.

This is a great product.  I had an electrician install the first one because I wasn't sure of the wiring but since then I have installed two more myself and they work like a charm.  They work great with Alexa.  All you have to do is download the Kasa app to set up the switch and connect it to your wifi.  Then you enable the Kasa skill in Alexa and have it discover the switch and boom...you're up and running.Keep in mind that it does require a neutral wire so if you're not sure about this you should have an electrician check it like I did.  They are fairly easy to install but they are deeper than a standard switch so sometimes the wiring inside the box will make it difficult to fit into a standard depth switch box.,5,1,2017-7-18,1,0,0

"My house is wired like Christmas tree lights from the 80’s, and I installed the switch in a 3-gang box.

Once you get your switch scheduled to turn on and off your pretty much set but that’s the problem I have a switch that I can’t schedule because most of the time I’m waiting for it to connect up to my WiFi and just when I think I’ve got it it won’t save it and I lose connection. Very frustrating.,2,1,2017-12-6,1,1,0

"This is an excellent product.  Wish I would have purchased / installed this a long time ago.  Installation was pretty easy with the main difficulty being the wall plate cover.  My installation was in a two switch box which forced me to use the existing wall plate cover (not the one that comes with the switch).  This required a bit of adjustment involving shaving some of the plastic off of the existing wall plate cover in order to make it flush with the wall.  Not a big deal, just a little extra work.  Setting up the switch with my WIFI network, and configuring the KASA app was simple and quick.  I especially love the ability to turn on/off the switch based on localized sunrise / sunset times.",4,1,2017-1-8,1,1,0

My brother conecteted the light switch which replaced an existing switch so I can't speak for that but it looked to go as expected. Downloading and setting up the Kasa app was easy too. Also linking it to the Google Home was easy. Getting Google Home's voice recognition to work with it was an issue. After going over the setup many times and failing to get the assistant to do as I said I finally call Google's assist helpline. The issue ended up being I was using a Yahoo email account and not a Gmail (Google) account which is not told to you in Google's setup instructions. After deleting the Yahoo and making it a Gmail account in both the Google Home and Kasa apps the voice recognition works fine. So make sure you have a Gmail account setup. One last thing: make sure you turn on the remote function in the Kasa app settings so you can work the switch from your smart phone when you are off your internet signal.,4,1,2017-9-23,1,0,0
"I really like these things except they take up so much room and block the 2nd outlet on a standard outlet, and if you plug it into a 6-plug wall power block, it ends up blocking 4 outlets including the one it is plugged into (effectively giving you 2 usable outlets).",2,1,2018-12-27,1,0,0

I linked it with Alexa and now I tell Alexa to turn on my pool pump. Pretty cool for a fraction of the cost of a wifi pool control. Keep in mind that the max amps on theses things is about 2 or 3 amps so it will do lights or maybe a ceiling fan or a low voltage transformer. Also must keep in mind that it can not be exposed to the elements. For indoor use only. Most switches are inside anyway but for outdoor switches, you may have to figure out how to get it inside.

"Works well once installed. I installed in a 2 switch box which was a tight fit. Definitely make sure the neutral is in the box and connect the white wire to the switch white wire or it will not work. I also used a different switch plate (other than the single one that comes with the switch) that had the large hole for the smart switch and a regular hole for the regular switch. I had to fiddle with it to get both to fit properly. One gotcha is if you don't get the switch plate on properly it can accidentally hit the reset button on the bottom of the switch and keep it pressed in. This threw me off for a while until I figured it out and got the switch plate on correctly.

If you’re able to change your own light switch it’s pretty straight forward. Granted I’m not the best. It wasn’t a difficult install. Most of my problems came from the wire box having lots of wires already inside. It works excellently. The switch is very responsive.,5,1,2019-6-14,1,0,0
"UPDATE 03/21/2017: Knocking off a star...They don't self-cycle after an outage... Doing some home improvement projects and I have to periodically kill the power to do electrical work.  After powering the house back up, the switches don't automatically reconnect to the wireless network.  Fortunately, there's a scan button (kind of hidden--it's in the metal trim below the switch, on the right).  Quick press and it'll start the switch scanning the wifi network... 30 seconds later, the switch should be back online (that is, if your wifi network is back online, too).  A minor nuisance, but the reason I'm knocking off a full star is the nuisance combined with the fact that there's no rhyme or reason to it... Sometimes all of the switches will need to be reset, sometimes only a few (one or two DID self-cycle).

warning before you buy this item make sure you wires in your switch box have a white(common or neutral) a live (black or red) and of course a ground (usually bare) If you do not have a common or neutral you can not use this switch.

"I have this installed to my exterior and kitchen lights and it's integrated with my Echo Dots.  I have a tendency to leave my kitchen light on to add more lighting to my livingroom.

Now, I just tell Alexa to turn off the kitchen light, and it does it without me lifting a finger.  I have the exterior lights set to turn on a dusk and off at dawn automatically...it knows when that occurs so I don't need to adjust the times.  I can also tell Alexa to turn my exterior lights off if I wanted it off at any particular time.  The switch also works manually like any other switch to override a pre-programed command.When I originally installed these switches, I installed the app and while I was setting it up, I was having a hard time programming it.  The switches were not staying on my home network long enough for me to program it.  I was getting frustrated...then set the programming aside.  With my smart home conversion, I also purchased a new Logitech remote hub/system.  While I was setting the hub, it wasn't recognizing my home network.  Then DING!!!

Works great with the echo dot and alexa. I love how the switch looks like a rocker switch but acts as a button instead. Its a brilliant design!I am an electrician so the instal was easy. I wont fit in a very shallow box so beware if you are trying to fit this in a old house with shallow boxes it may not work. other than that the kasa program works great! the little subtle light in the switch is brilliant for bedrooms. A dimmer would be nice to add but i love the product as an electrician and as a consumer.,5,1,2016-12-12,1,1,0
"Overall, the app works well and quick. However, during the day time, I cannot tell whether the light switch is on or off because the LED indicator is too dimmed/white. One suggestion is changing the indicator light to green so the day light doesn’t camouflage it. I want to know if I accidentally turn on the outdoor light without looking outside. Also,  it would have been nicer if the switch is flush.  The current switch appears to be permanently on since the switch position doesn't change.",3,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0

I use switch on a regular basis as any other home switch but from my phone. rarely have to touch switch. it is very responsive.  One downside not with with switch but with some of the product with TP-link is that that they don't have more devices to use with Kasa app. For example the camera they have work with another app. So what am trying to say is that i would like to see more devices to be use with Kasa app which is a great app and have all devices consolidated in one app. am sure other customer will feel the same way. Also to have more device for the home such wireless leak sensor or others devices that would make home ware of whats going on at home.,5,1,2017-2-15,1,0,0

Switch works as described although I thought one of the options was to have the switch work dawn to dusk in addition to acting on a time basis.  Maybe I misread the online information.?

For the most part the switches work as advertised and I love the convenience of controlling them with Alexa or through the app. My biggest complaint is the need to reset them because of losing the WiFi connection which seems to happen with some but not all of them. It always seems to be the same ones and others in close proximity never have the problem so I don’t think it’s my WiFi. I also had a problem with one that was needing reset and when it came back online it had a message about needing a firmware update which it performed after which it completely stopped working even manual operation.,4,1,2018-4-14,1,0,0
Very quick response to the app.  The only strange thing is the light on the switch is on when the light powered by the switch is off and off when the light is on. You would think it would be the opposite... lol. Other than that it works great.,5,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0

Great switch. Super easy install. The only hiccup I had was the switch filled up my entire electrical box so the wire nuts would not fit in the box with the switch.

Easy to install and set up. Basically a direct switch replacement. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that a regular switch has a metal mounting plate with a standard thickness and this switch has a plastic mounting plate that is twice as thick. If you are placing it in a single switch configuration it won't be an issue. If you are putting it in a 3 gang switch box (like I was) the original switch cover doesn't line up as easily having different thickness mounting plates.,4,1,2018-5-31,1,0,0

"Great WiFi controlled light switch (with Amazon Echo, Echo Dot - Alexa!). Really slick for SINGLE switch controlled circuits. Can be used for fan control too. Be sure to realize, NO 3-WAY SWITCHED CIRCUITS (2 switches for same light or cluster of lights). I called TP-LINK Tech Support to help me with an issue I'm about to describe. The rep indicated TP-LINK is working on a 3-Way switch released sometime this year. Introducing a 3-way will eliminate the need for Smart Light Bulbs. More cost effective for clusters of bulbs. At today's costs, 2 WiFi bulbs @ ~$17/each = 1 HS200 (considering Amazon's cost of $34.99). Approximately. More bulbs to control makes HS200 more cost effective.Issue: HS200 instructions suggests connecting BOTH black wires to ""HOT"". Hot would be Line - the Black or Red wire from the electrical panel.

"We love this wi-fi light switch! We had looked at getting Wink hub and bulbs awhile ago but ended up not because the only way to turn the on or off was with our phones, and we didn't want that. We wanted the option to either use our phone or a switch. So after we had gotten an Amazon Echo Dot and stumbled across this Alexa-compatible switch, we took a chance on it. Installation was pretty straight-forward, pretty much the same as a regular light switch. Once I got in installed I set up an account and added this switch and it worked right off. I then got it set up to work with Alexa and since then we haven't used our phones with this once, we always just tell Alexa to turn it on or off or we physically hit the switch if we're over near it. We like how the switch is a physical switch that clicks and springs back and not just a touch pad. Maybe others feel different but we like the feel of a switch. We haven't yet tried it out when the wi-fi has been down so I'm curious to if the physical switch will still control the lights without wi-fi. If you've tried this please leave a comment about what happened.",5,1,2017-10-23,1,2,1

"These are fantastic switches if you just need a basic on/off switch. The switch will not work if you have 2 or more switches controlling the same light (3-way switching).I've installed tons of switches, lights, electrical boxes and plugs and I found these to be exactly as easy as any other switch to install. A nice touch is that the pre-attached wires on the back of the box are already exposed and the ends are soldered so there's a nice surface to attach to the existing home wires. You need to verify that the box you're planning to install the switch in is of standard depth and now shallow before ordering because these switches are very deep. You also need to make sure there's a common wire in the switch box you're updating. This is usually a white wire that is capped to another white wire in the box and not connected to the current switch. Regular light switches don't use this wire, it just by-passes in the box. You will usually have this wire if there are two sets of wire coming into the box at the switch. Some switches are at the end of the line on a circuit and they will have both the white and black wire already connected to the switch. In that case, when the white wire is connected to the switch, the white wire is NOT A COMMON WIRE. It's only a common wire if it's NOT CONNECTED to a traditional switch. I hope that helps with some of the confusion I've seen in other comments. As for the other important things about electrical work like turning off the breaker, please make sure you have some type of voltage meter or power line detector. Just because the light goes out doesn't always mean that there are not live wires in the box. Some boxes have more than one circuit running thru them.",5,1,2017-2-23,1,1,0

This is a single pole switch and the second black wire is a load wire that MUST be hooked up. Well my house does not have a load wire in any of my current switches. TP-Link sent me the installation diagram, which does not come with the switch BTW and it confirms that the second wire is needed. The answer in their doc is to hire an electrician to install the switch. Sorry I am not going to pay for an electrician so unfortunatly the switch went back.

However, the main feature that I want is the ability to schedule these devices to turn on/off at the specified times.  This feature does not consistently work.  Many times, they “forgot” the scheduled events or the scheduled events kept on disabled themselves.  As the result, some of my lights stayed on or did not turn on as expected.",2,1,2016-12-15,1,0,0

"Finally! A smart home solution that actually works and is very simple to install and use. I've gone through a significant number of other devices like this (Wemo, Insteon with HomeSeer and others) and had difficulties with reliability. The Insteon devices sometimes worked, but not reliably. Plus, using these devices with one of the many hub hardware/software options  expensive and has usability and maintenance troubles of its own. If you're a techie with deep pockets and lots of free time, and a very patient spouse, these might be OK.The TPLink Smart family of devices are so reliable and easy to use it is almost unbelievable. I have the wall switches, bulbs and smart plugs and all work perfectly.  The remote functionality works fine over my Verizon Home Wireless router (no issues with needing incoming connections, port forwarding or other ugliness of this sort). I'm using the Android Kasa app, and have not encountered any issues at all with it. The scene support is fairly basic (allows you to group a number of commands/devices into one user action, e.g. ""arriving at my home"" turn on lights""), but sufficient for my needs.

"I recently purchased 3 of the HS200 Smart Light Switch, and 3 of the HS110 Smart Plugs. They all arrived yesterday, and I finished the install a few hours ago. The setup and install went very well, with one small caveat. The light switches needed to be installed side-by-side in a single, 3-gang box, so I could not use the included oversized single covers and gaskets that came with each unit. And the 3 gang plastic cover that was installed over the old switches was slightly too small for the new smart switches--it kept depressing the 'restart' and 'reset' small push buttons beneath the lever switch. I had to file the short sides of the cover in all 3 positions to give a little more clearance, and after that all went as planned.The Kasa app found each of the devices, and in a short time they were all set up and functional through the app. I also created some 'scenes', and set a schedule for some of the lights to come on at sunset.

These smart light switches are freaking amazing! They are really easy to install and app set up is also very easy. They work as intended and do everything I need them to do. I bought 10 of them and a 3 channel HS210 and I'm very satisfied. I will be buying more in the near future.

"I installed a couple of these switches to control my hallway and living room lights, I got 2 switches installed, setup with Kasa, then setup with Google Home and Alexa, it took me about an hour to set it all up including wiring in the switches and that was after having a few beers. I can now turn on and off everything with my voice I have had no issues with these switches at all, honestly was expecting some issues but it all worked fantastically.  I also have a couple of the mini wifi plugs from Tp-link and those work very well also.I intend to buy about 8 more of these switches to control all the main lights in my apartment.  One thing I really like is I created a group that has all my smart lights in it and I can say ""Alexa turn on/off all lights""  and all my lights will come on or go off at once, this is great for those nights you think you may hear something in the house, if you turn on all lights anyone in there is likely to run, also nice at bedtime you can just go to your room get in bed then ask Alexa to turn all lights off.  Look forward to when I have all my lights setup with smart switches (or plugs if it is a lamp).",5,1,2017-6-14,1,1,0

"Utter failure.  I wired up the unit to replace my outdoor light switch.  I wired the wires correctly.  I could see that the unit powered on.  Pressing the switch, it would like up a ring, but my lights wouldn't turn on.  I figured I'd try linking it to Kasa in case they required it.. and Kasa failed the connection at the end where I enter in a name for the device.  I followed the instructions to retry by holding the reset 5 seconds.. but it auto connected to my network, and wouldn't let me re-establish a link.  I then tried to do the ""manual"" method, where you need to connect to the unit directly via WiFi.  There was no WiFi network matching the name given by Kasa.Now I went into debugging mode..  I could hear a relay click, but no voltage power was travelling down the Neutral line from the Live wire.  I confirmed with my Fluke Volt Detect that no power was coming out.  From here I figure it's a problem with the relay.",1,1,2017-10-19,1,1,0

"I chose this over Wemo because of price, especially when it was on sale.  Whether it's TP-Link switch or bulb, they all work with Alexa without a hub.  One down side to their product is the lack of IFTTT integration.  It doesn't work directly with Nest either.  If you are looking for smart switch and bulb to work with Alexa, this will do the work.  You might really want to think about the IFTTT integration and if you need that or not.  For example, I have this switch in garage.  Using SpotCam and IFTTT, when the Spotcam in the garage detects motion, like garage door being opened, IFTTT can be triggered to turn on the Wemo switch.  Can't do that with TP-Link switch.  Yes, depending on the server issues and etc, IFTTT sometime takes way too long, but it hasn't been much issue for me.This switch looks and installs same as Wemo switch.  You will have to make sure you find the right wires, but it should be straight forward once you open up the switch on the wall.  The app will also walk you through the installation process.  I have several of TP-Link switch at home now and they all work really well.  Switch has little white halo, so it's really easy to see the switch at night.  I replaced couple of my dim switch with this as well.  No, this switch does not have dimming function, but I really didn't need that.",5,1,2017-3-22,1,0,0

I gave this product a 4 star review not because it is an inherently bad product but because the install was not as easy as was stated and the customer support listened to my issue and told me the switch would probably not work where I was trying to use it... But in the time it took them to come up with the answer I had figured out how to fix the issue myself and now its working great.  This would be a 5 star product had the customer service behind the product been a little better.  My issue with installing it came with the fact that you need a neutral wire.  I knew this was the case and my home is new construction as of 2010 so I knew I had neutrals in all of my boxes so I wasn't really concerned with that.  Once I went to install it though I had multiple neutral wires in the back of the box and from most things I read it wouldn't matter which neutral wire I used and this seems like it is true as I got the switch installed and my power back on everything looked good!  Even got it connected to wifi... But then when I went to click it on for the first time the light flicked on then the switch rebooted and the light shut right back off... I couldn't figure out what was wrong as I wired up everything just the way it stated to so I tried giving customer support a call..  I got through to someone pretty quickly but it was pretty apparent within a few minutes of talking with them that they had no idea what was wrong and the conversation wasn't the easiest to have as the English was pretty broken...  Eventually the lady on the other end of the line told me to take a picture of my wire setup and she would forward it up to her higher level department and call me back within an hour.  So I did this and continued to trouble shoot the problem myself... So I tried tying the neutral wire from the unit into the big bundle of neutral wires in the housing instead of just one and then it started to work perfect... Wasn't to long after I got it solved that customer service called me back and told me the higher level came back and said that it wont work with my setup.  So when I told her that I got it figured out she asked how I got it working so after telling her she said thank you and told me to have a good day.  Once I got the units installed they work great and its really nice to be able to control the lights through the app or through my echo with my voice.  There is not currently Smart Hub support for this product but there is a work around for that if you dig enough online and the price point for these switches is about 10 bucks cheaper than the other options out there which when you talking about 20 light switches in a home adds up quick!,4,1,2016-12-27,1,0,0

The installation video truthfully demonstrates how to replace a single standard switch with this tp-link wifi switch. However, if you are looking to replace two standard switches located in one switch box, it is nearly impossible to fit these switches because the backside of these tp-link switches is significantly larger.

I was unable to make a wifi connection to the first switch I installed because the switch wouldn't go into ""pairing"" mode.  I eventually determined that if I loosened the screw holding the switch in place, it would transmit a signal and allow my phone to connect to configure it.

"At first I was having so much trouble with this device and my Echo Dot. The installation and setup was mostly painless (see below) but every day it was losing the WiFi connection and I could no longer control it with Alexa yet it worked with the Kasa App, and I could not figure out why. I finally realized that it was because of how I have my network setup. My router only issues 1 DNS setting that I could customize for DHCP devices. The other DNS setting was always the router's IP address but my router is not was managing the internet connection (its a unique setup). This was causing the switch to constantly lose its connection to the internet. Why it required the internet to function with Alexa on a local network I have no idea, but the biggest flaw is that there is now way to set static network settings so I could force specific DNS settings. I was forced to change how my network was setup so the router controlled the internet, and the DHCP settings issued a DNS setting that would work. I have several other smart home devices and none of them ever had this issue.My only other complaint is with the cover plate, it is incredibly hard to get it onto the switch. It has to be snapped on in 4 different places and it only snaps on if it is flush against the switch. Because the switch in screwed into a flexible wall box, it is impossible for me to snap the plate on. For now I have it taped on until I can find a way to make it snap on. I will probably need a bracket or some kind of hard plastic plate to hold the switch in place so I can put enough pressure on the switch plate to snap it on.",4,1,2017-12-19,1,0,0

The other brands I tried practically require a professional to set up switches that dissappear when the power is lost. This company primarily makes routers, this is probably why they pair so well.

"After installing seven of these switches my router crashes at least once a day causing me to constantly unplug and re-plug the router to reset it. I believe these switches are overloading my wifi router which also has many other smart devices connected. I just had the cable company put in a new router, wires, switches, etc., but the problem still plagues me. I did not have any overloading problems until I installed these switches. I was hoping a software update from TP-Link would fix it, but when they finally did update the software the problem persisted! My only recourse seems to be ; buy a different (hopefully better) router or rip out all these smart switches!I also had an initial problem when I first installed the first switch. I could not get it to work with the Amazon Alexa system. After calling for help from Amazon and the switch company along with many resets of my apps, and wifi connections I gave up with their suggested fixes. Then after hours of talking with tech-people as I probed their Kasa app I realized they have a remote switch on default ""off""! How dumb could this be, nobody knew! When I turned the default to ""on"" Alexa immediately started to control the switch.",2,1,2017-7-26,1,2,0

"Very easy to install and easy to setup. The packaging has pretty much everything you need to install the switch. .The switches picked up on the WiFi and were a breeze to get configured. The TP-Link's Kasa app makes it really easy to set them up. After installing three of these I got a notification that the firmware could be updated. The app updated them all at once without any hiccups. The app also makes it trivial to set a schedule per switch. This way I could turn our outside lights on every night at a specific time and then turn them all off at a different time. Moving the switch from one WiFi network to another was also really easy. It just involves resetting the switch. Don't be worried, the settings will be carried over",5,1,2017-10-19,1,0,0

"I would give the switch 5 stars except for two cons. The first is that I was unable to get the switch to work if the power was wired to the light. This is when you only have one cable(two wires) to the light switch box. As we have in the older pre 1950's section of our house. It switch would light up but would not manually operate the light. When I had power to the box, i.e. two cables, one from power the other to the light, it worked great. It even connected and no drops in an area where our wifi signal is weak. App could be a little more intuitive, but the help section answered all my questions about setting up schedules and getting it to work with our echo. Which is way cool by the way. The second con is that there inside is big and leaves little room the the switch box for the wires. This was a problem for me because I had one with three cables one power and two to lights. As I tried to stuff it all back in the box, I disconnected on and had to go through the whole install again. BTW I have kids who for the life of them can't turn off lights. I got these so that I could do it with voice commands. Now I can except in the older parts. The pic is the box it would not work in.",3,1,2017-2-4,1,2,1

"Easy to set up as long as you know electrical basics because it needs a hot and neutral in addition to the load wire going to the light/fan so definitely make sure your switch box have a neutral wire otherwise you won't be able to install without a professional. The switch is pretty bulky, so fitting all the wires back into the box can be a bit of a challenge. Getting the switch running was very easy since it runs over Wifi and does not require a separate hub. I love that the Kasa app has sunset and sunrise features that automatically adjust and the overall interface of the Kasa app is easy to navigate and use. The switch itself looks really nice when installed and the nightlight feature is a great idea so you can find the switch in the dark.

"There may be nothing wrong with this product -- honestly, I don't know.  The important question is  ""Why don't I know?"".  I don't know because I never installed the switch.  So, the bigger question is ""Why not?""  This is why.  Proper installation requires a neutral wire in your wall box.  The existing switch was wired with a ""switch leg"", thus no neutral wire, and no safe installation.  One would think that this kind of information might have been on the box.  It wasn't  Or, maybe on the installation instructions?  Nope!  I only became aware of the problem after I opened the box, examined the product, and saw too many wires on the switch!  Thinking that there must be a solution I went to the support page of TP-Link's web site. Only after drilling down quite a bit did I discover that this product wasn't going to work for me!There may be nothing wrong with this product, but be cautious before you buy it.

I have always liked the TP-Link products. Perform well. Problem with this one is it is Proprietary. I have 5 different brands of plug wifi and use one app for all. This plug will only use 'Kasa' app. You can not use any other wifi with it but TP-Link. And they really want you to use their HUB.I have already installed or I would return. Very disappointed. The idea behind these is a consumer can use whatever app they prefer and setup the wifi switch. I am going to stick with the Korean made models. I have had great luck with them.

"During installation, the switch went into an endless reboot loop. This was caused by a slight overtightening of the bottom screw. If you run into that problem, back out the bottom screw a bit to see if it fixes the problem. The reason this occurs is the placement of the reset buttons below the main switch. When installing this all-plastic fixture, the housing tends to bend, actuating the buttons. I hope that TP-Link can come up with a better mechanical design that prevents this from happening.That being said, the switch works well when controlled via an Amazon Echo Dot. Does anybody need a voice-controlled switch? Hardly, but it does add a nice futuristic touch to the house;-) If they could come up with switches for three-way configurations, that would be even sweeter since most of our light fixtures are wired that way.",4,1,2017-5-7,1,0,0

"Switch works ok but the app & approach has flaws. Firstly, no instructions with the switch, you have to download the app and then go step by step. This isn’t really practical when working in a construction environment plus the only reason we needed them was because the load & line cables are indifferent but you don’t know that until you get the app. 2nd issue, the app only works on local Wi-Fi until you registered your account which may be fine but for me the registeration process kept failing due to their server so we can’t get remote access. I think they need to rethink the practicalities of their approach.After less than 24 hrs, revised to one star. Now I can’t access the switch. Get a message that I need to be on MY Wi-Fi network even when I am connected and stood right next to the device. Looks like a one and done app.....buyer beware.",1,1,2018-7-5,1,0,0

"This unit works well once installed, and installation was easy except for one problem.  The flanges that actually attach the unit to the box in the wall are plastic, fairly thick plastic at that.  On most conventional switches/outlets that flange is metal and therefore thinner and stronger.  Sometimes you have to push on a newly installed switch to press it back into the box due to the other wires in there.  Plus the inside ""box"" of this switch itself is relatively bulky, meaning you need to make even more room for it inside the wall box.  These plastic flanges will not tolerate as much pushing that way.  Finally once installed in a 3-gang box like I did, the thicker plastic flanges holds the cover plate away from the wall slightly.  Otherwise it works well, but I wish the mounting flanges were metal.  If you are installing this unit in a box by itself then this objection would likely not matter.",4,1,2018-1-20,1,0,0

"NO LONGER WORKS WITH ALEXA OR GOOGLE HOME.  And it doesn't seem TP-Link cares to fix it.  I bought this smart switch and a bunch of smart plugs.  Initially, they all work fine and I had no issues.  Starting about a week and a half ago, all TP-Link smart products stopped working cold.  Alexa or Google Home would say the devices are not available right now.  There are reports all over the Internet that this is widespread and happens to many users.  I've removed the skill and re-added it to no avail.So far, nothing has seemed to fix it and I hear nothing from TP-Link on the issue.  My other smart devices like Nest thermostat, Nest cam, smart LED bulbs (from a different company), etc. all still work just fine.  With a huge, major issue like this, I would recommend that everyone stays as far away from TP-Link products as possible.",1,1,2018-3-13,1,0,0

"I installed this in place of a Z-Wave smart switch and I couldn't be happier.

I've set it on a schedule for night, it turns on and off like clockwork according to the schedule and it was much easier to configure than the previous Z-Wave. Since I have both Amazon Alexa and a Google Home it's great that this works with them. I can ask if the light is on or off or turn it on or off via Alexa or Home. I plan to figure out what other switches would benefit from scheduling and likely installing more. I'm pretty happy with the Kasa app as well which is how you control it, however I usually just end up interacting it with it through Google Home and don't have to worry about the app beyond initial set-up.",5,1,2017-9-28,1,0,0

My only issue with the installation was that instead of having two black wires coming from my wall, I only had one black wire and the tp-link kasa installation guide shown having two black wires, one white and a copper. I thought I could easily just leave one of the switches' black wire not connected with anything, but it didn't work that way although my switch could still connect with wifi and stuff..

"I recently moved into an older home that had some very weird wiring.  For example, the outside lights on the back of my house are wired to a switch in the upstairs bedroom.  Very inconvenient.  This switch, along with an Amazon Echo Dot, is amazing.  I can now use the Kasa app on my phone or my voice using Alexa to control these lights.  It saved me money in the end because I would have had to pay an electrician hundreds of dollars to rewire my house.  The timer function works great, and now my outside lights go on at sunset, and off at sunrise.  I've purchased two, and honestly and if I had the money I would buy 15 more of them.

"I recently purchased and installed TP-Link Light Switch.  Although installation instruction was not provided, you can find the instruction from Youtube.  I love everything about this product as I also purchased several plug-ins.  My only reason I gave this product 3 stars is b/c most homes these days do not have a single light switch holder.  Most homes have 2 or more switches combined together in each room.  Although I used existing dual switch cover, b/c this light switch is a bit bulking, it will not cover the switches evenly, and will leave some gaps.  However, I still lkike the fact that I can control the lights using my iphone or Alexia is a big plus over the uneven b/t existing switch and the new one.I'm hoping eventually TP-Link understand this problem and produce replacement for single switch covers.",3,1,2016-11-24,1,0,0

"This switch is awesome! Installation out of the box took less than 10 minutes! The hardest part for me was getting the wires back into my light switch box after installing this, but that is of no fault of this switch. The wires running from this won't hinder anyone's switch box as they aren't too long at all. The first thing you have to do when you get this switch is install TP Link's Kasa app onto your smartphone. From there you select which smart home hardware you are installing, and the instructions are very straightforward and even include useful illustrations for anyone that is having difficulties. Once everything is setup, the lights wired to the switch work like a charm! I have my switch hooked up in the kitchen and I simply say ""Alexa turn on the kitchen"" and the lights turn on and off. The only issue I ran into is the wall plate. It is meant for a single plate, but my kitchen wall plate uses a double plate, but I found a third party plate that works just fine. I would highly recommend this switch for kitchen and outdoor lights, because they are so easy to use!",5,1,2016-10-31,1,0,0

"This thing works. I had a pesky problem of turning on/off my patio lights based on actual sunlight. I tried the photosensitive switch but the sensor placement is key and therefore not a very flexible option.  Also, there are issues related to flickering etc.  A switch based on timer works well but is not sensitive to seasonal changes and hence need constant adjustments.  This switch solved all those issues in one shot. Installation was dead easy: Turn off the mains, remove old switch and put the new one.  The software configuration would not have been easier too with the help of the phone app.  Now, I set my switch to turn ON at sunset (this gets pulled based on geo location data) and trun OFF in the morning.  Awesome stuff 5*.",5,1,2016-12-2,1,0,0
"I love these things. You don't need a separate hub like many other products out there to control them. I have the original Amazon Echo and got the 6 pack of $50 dots so Alexa can hear me in any room of my house. The integration works flawlessly.For those of you that are hooking these up yourself, it's not that hard. The main trick, if you haven't dealt with a white ""common"" wire in the past, is to add the white wire from this switch to all the white wires in the wire nut in your outlet (if you have more than one bundled in a nut). You just need to untwist your common bundle nut (all white wires in this bundle), add the white wire from the switch to that bundle, and re-twist the nut. At first, I thought I needed to untwist the common wires in the outlet and attach to a single common wire, but the switch would not work. When I attached to all the common wires in the outlet, it worked. I had never dealt with wiring a switch to common wires, so this was new to me. The other wires are wired up just like a normal light switch.",5,1,2016-10-26,1,1,0

Painfull process of removing the switch and skill from alexa, then have to remove the switch from the TP-link Kasa app. Re-set up the switch by putting it in wifi mode, connect my phone to it, re-add it to Kasa and then re-link everything in Alexa App. I have had to do this 3 times in a week as the kasa app will state that the device is not liked to my account.

"I made the mistake of replacing all the switches in my home thinking Amazon Alexa could control them all; purchased three Alexas and everything worked well for a month.  Then on 28 FEB Amazon's S3 servier went down for 12 hours and nothing worked; once Amazon's cloud servers were back up, TP-Link cloud servers went down and have been down for two more days.  ""Put your stuff in the cloud..."" they said; ""Your data is safe and always acessible in the cloud,"" they said.  Boy, do I feel foolish.  I manage a data center for the Federal Government, so I was amazed to learn that Amazon and TP-Link operate with insufficient redundancy to ensure cloud service is maintained.  In brief, if you're looking for a working light switch with very unreliable cloud connectivity, then this product is for you.  However, if you want a reliable so-called ""wireless, automated"" home, my advice is that these companies are simply not capable of providing it.  I wish I'd stuck with my flip-on switches. It would have saved me hours of installation time; hours of time on the phone with Amazon and TP-Link to only be told, ""we're working on restoring service;"" over a grand to purchase all the TP-Link and Amazon products that were supposed to work; and the 5 minutes it's taking right now to warn you all about these services.",1,1,2017-3-2,1,5,0

I have a TP link plug and the wall switch. The plug was seamless from an install and connecting to the network and Alexa. The switch I had professionally wired and have been unable to get it to connect to the network. That's the good news. The technical support for this product is horrendous. First you can not understand them but more importantly they are incompetent. When I was unable to connect the device using my Apple Smartphone they told me to borrow a neighbors Android device to try to connect and that the device is not compatible with Apple IOS despite the fact it says it is on the device box and the TP Link website. even manual use of the switch doesn't work as it turns the light on for just a few seconds before it turns off on its own. After four go rounds with technical support--each one less helpful than the previous I realized they are outsourced to China or Taiwan or somewhere and the women I was dealing with have no training on the device and are just incompetent. I returned the product and bought the WeMo version. It installed easily and worked beautifully connecting the network via its app was simple. Do yourself a favor and buy the WeMo brand instead.,1,1,2016-11-30,1,3,0

"I like it, but be prepared for some modest tech hurdles.  This is my second TP-Link device (first was plug in switch) that I've set up to control lights in my home with my Amazon Echo.  First, be aware that if your switch circuit does not have a neutral wire this will not work.  It is not uncommon for the neutral to be run straight to the light fixture and only the hot (black) wire run back to a switch in a loop that is closed by the switch.  If that's your setup, you're out of luck with this unit.  Setup is pretty straight forward, but problems can crop up.  For this install, the Kasa app kept trying to link with my wireless network printer instead of the switch.  Disconnecting the power to the printer solved the problem.  Also, just as with my first install (the plug in outlet switch) performance is spotty at first.  That is, Alexa will say OK to the command, but nothing happens at the light.  Must be a system learning curve, because on the first unit after two days this was no longer experienced.  Just installed this switch today, and it's not yet working at 100%, but I'm optimistic that it will.Finally, I'm moved to say that I like my Echo better every day.  Can't wait to issue the command ""Open the pod bay door Alexa.""",4,1,2016-11-24,1,2,0

Sad to say I will look for something else to spend my money on even if it does include a bride switch. My son uses Lutron switches which are not only three way switches but are dimmable. that work great with Alexa. You also have to have a neutral wire present in the light switch to make the system work. I understand this. It wound be nice to have a pure switch operated system even if it used batteries to do the switching for special application. I should have read the reviews. I would not have bought and would have started down a different path. Having said that id all you need is to switch a single switch on and off and you have a neutral present in the box i'm sure this is great.,3,1,2017-1-13,1,0,0

"I was very excited about automating my home and using Alexa, so I bought several smart outlets and one smart switch to test out. While the outlets work great in my home, the switch is another story.For potential buyers: Make sure you know about your home's wiring before buying the HS200 or any other smart light switch. My home was built in 1996 and I was certain that it was modern enough to have the required wiring. I misunderstood what a neutral wire actually does and thought that the white wire in the walls was neutral, but it's not! I've read that my local code did not start requiring a neutral wire to light switches until 2011, so most people's homes will not be able to work with this switch. Basically, don't make my mistake. Check to make sure that you have three wires AND a ground before buying.",2,1,2016-12-10,1,1,0

Don't waste your money unless you've already taken apart your light switch. It will only work if your electric was wired a specific way.

You can set a schedule for each device with as many on and off times as you like, but these are set times. You can set the devices to come on and off by sunset. There is an away mode,  but you can only set two times in the away schedule, an on or off.

"After struggling with getting this to see my wifi network for hours, I was wrist deep in cords and I had four routers running trying to figure out why Kasa could only see two of the networks.

The fact that this will only work on password protected routers isn't mentioned anywhere, not even online, so it was extremely frustrating until I figured it out.I'm unable to password protect my main wireless router (it's from the ISP and they changed the default router login information) so I ended up taking an old router and configuring it to work as a wireless bridge. There's directions online on how to do this for your specific second router, it's not too difficult if you're technologically literate. I then WPA2 password protected my wireless bridge and connected the switch to it without any issues. Then I altered my Echo Dots to connect through the bridge so everything is on the same wireless network, and now the lightswitch is working with Alexa. Setup was easy before and after the wifi issue.

Before the installation of this switch, we could push the button and our garage door would open as we approach the house. Now, after getting the interference from this switch, you have to get right up to the garage door before it will finally open.  We are researching someway to change the frequency on the light switch or blockage interference in some other manner.  But, we have found no solution yet.We are certain that it is the switch.

So I had an electrician come out to install this just because I didn’t want to do it wrong or mess it up. Turns out not all switches are wired the same!

"I want to LOVE these light switches. Simple to install and easy to wire up if you know what your doing. They do not support IFTTT (which would add several other automated options, like when coming home your lights turn on.) They do not have any motion sensors yet, again preventing any kind of automation much like a way to sense room activity, or lack there of. These switches do not work if you have a duel light switch to a single light option (Like a switch at your garage door and a separate switch at the other end of room to turn on kitchen lights) To get around this you would have to remove the 3 wire option to the slave switch. Overall happy. Would like to see IFTTT, Motion Sensors, and Remote switches to turn on lights or automate functions (like the Insteon remote keypad). Further the ""newly branded"" TP-Link isnt really dealing with the customer service issues they have always had. Support via social media is almost non-existant, and Forum support the same, which is my reason for a 3 star rating. This is an un-bias review, they didnt pay me or give me any product.

"Just so we are all on the same page, this is a review of a free product received from TP-LINK as part of the review program. So far I have enjoyed the hs200 switch even more so than the smart plugs I have purchased. The main reason I like this switch is it’s not an add-on and blends in with normal decor.  After, I finally found a single pole switch in my house the install was fairly straight forward, with the exception that I had to go online to view the install documents. I first installed the switch in my kitchen but my wife missed the simple toggle of a normal switch. I then moved it to the living room and it was great. The little built in night light is really nice but doesn’t provide enough light to walk by just enough so you can see the switch and you aren’t fumbling for the switch in the dark. The best features for me is the away mode, where the lights turn on and off at random times. I travel and between this and my smart plugs my home looks occupied at all times.If you have put in normal light switches and/or outlets you should be able to install this, just make sure you turn off the power before you do. I actually plan on moving the switch again into a 2 gang box for a fan/light. I’m curious on how it will look as the plate the hs200 comes with seems thicker than most switch plates.",4,0,2016-8-16,1,1,1

If you try connecting it without a neutral, it will start up but it’ll fail to turn on the light or device. In most cases, the neutral and ground wires are tied together at the electrical panel. If you have no neutral wire, just use the ground wire. Hook the switch’s neutral and ground wire right into the ground from the panel.

The App is Flawless for me, and they all just work, flawlessly with the Amazon Echo throughout the home.  You can also pull up the App and they work.....amazingly its instantaneous, I'm loving these.These 3 Way work.  Now, I learned you don't ""have"" to put each one on the same circuit, so if you are okay going against the TP Link recommendation, since they come in pairs, you can put 1 on a plug and have it work, and put the other one on a different plug and name it separately, and BAM you have two 3 way circuits that are on your Alexa control (and Kasa App control etc).  I do have some ""4 way"" switches.....and they area  PAIN.  I thought they were 3 way, and one of them I got to work (don't ask me how, ha) but the other I cannot.  They have an extra wire, and it's a huge pain in the rump.  In general, it's awesome though.  I copied the review from the ""smart plugs"" as well, because all of the information is essentially the same, except for the install which for the switch you have to put in the wall switch (TURN OFF BREAKER< HA) and the plugs are just plug in and then the lamp or whatever goes in the plug.

"Works as described. This is my third Kasa TP-Link product (the other two are switched outlets), so I already had the app installed, and adding this was quick and easy, although the directions could have been a bit clearer that your phone has to first wi-fi connect DIRECTLY to the switch so the app can talk to it during the installation, THEN the switch will connect to your wi-fi. The app tries to do this for you, but it failed to do so on my Samsung S9+ phone, and I had to go into the wi-fi settings on the phone, find the switch, and connect to it. Once I did that and returned to the app, things moved along nicely. If you have other TP-Link wi-fi stuff installed, it will automagically pick up the wi-fi name and password, and those fields will already be filled in when you get to that screen. As soon as it connected to the Internet, it found a firmware update, and I let it install that - took about three minutes, with the app notifying me it was done. And once you establish wi-fi connectivity, the little green wi-fi light turns off, which was a bit disappointing - I liked seeing that. It turns on again in orange if it loses connectivity, then goes green and turns off once it reestablished its connection.The physical installation was somewhat difficult because the switch is wide, deep, and bulky.

"The switch works great and looks beautiful but it requires a little more skill than just ""plug and play"" to install and to get it to work on your internet and with the app.  The wiring is confusing:  there are two black wires and a neutral (white) because the box needs power when the light is off to sense the internet.  Depending on whether the switch you are replacing is the last on that particular electrical run or is located in the middle somewhere with power continuing on to the next switch or plug means different wiring requirements.  They probably need better wiring diagrams:  I have three of these switches, love them, but I really didn't know what I was doing and just tried different things (pigtail a white wire for sure and pigtail a black wire on one).  The switch does pick up your internet but it's a little squirrely if you are working with internet extenders in your house.  Don't give up, it's worth it.  Last thing:  it is difficult to rename or regroup this item once you've set it in the app or in your home assistant (Google or Alexa) - I'm still working that issue because my lighting setup changed when I bought the second one.

"The HS-200 wall switch requires a 4-wire setup with a neutral (not just ground) wire to work. Neutral wires were not officially required in light switches until 2011 which means MOST existing light switches contain regular 3-wire configurations. This means they have a black/white/green (or bare) wire but no neutral 4-wire configuration. The switch will not work with 3-wire setups. The description does not plainly state this. The description says it requires a single light switch and a neutral wire but often the white wire in a 3-wire black/white/green is considered a neutral. The product may be fantastic but it is useless with a 3-wire setup and this should be plainly stated BEFORE you purchase it. Although the neutral wire requirement is listed it is buried deep in the description and many will think that the neutral wire is one of the wires in a 3-wire setup.

"I'm using this switch with Alexa to control 4 fluorescent tube lights which are on top of a soffit in my kitchen. I just say, ""Alexa, turn on the soffit lights"" and the lights come on. I can also have her turn them off. One big advantage with this switch is that it doesn't require a hub like most other lights. All of the connectivity is built right into the switch. It can control whatever lights or devices you have running off of that switch, but all together, of course. It will only turn them on and off. There is no dimmer function.This wall switch replaces a regular wall switch. It is connected much the same as the old switch except that it needs a neutral wire which is usually white.I'm not an electrician by any means, but I've replaced several light switches with dimmer switches over the years. I checked the short instructions and diagram which came with the switch. It looked simple enough, 4 wires coming out of the switch which matched 4 wires coming out of the wall switch box, once the old switch was removed. Except that wasn't the case. There were 3 separate white or neutral wires coming out of the switch box, all twisted together. I have a healthy respect for electricity and figured I better check and find out if it was safe to connect the bundled 3 wires to the single white wire from the TP-Link switch. So I checked their website. This wasn't addressed there. But no problem, they say they have tech support 24/7. So I called. I waited 15 minutes on hold after going through several voice prompt options. Then I briefly spoke with someone with a heavy accent who said she'd connect me to someone who could help. After several minutes I was disconnected. I called back. This time I ended up on hold for 20 minutes before being disconnected. I also tried emailing. After more than a week I still haven't received a reply. So I consider Tech Support for this product non-existent. I finally found an answer to my question on one of their competitors websites, with videos. The solution was to connect to the 3 white wires with the one on the switch.

This can be iffy with some of the ""smart"" bulb systems out there which screw up your settings if you use the manual switch.  Installation is simple (as long as your box is deep enough).  You do need to make sure you have the proper wiring available with your old switch as some older homes may be problematical in this area.I also like the program-ability of the switch...setting hours for on and off..or random hours if you are away, etc.  And it's nice to be able to check from your phone while you are away from your house whether or not you left a light on.  It's also nifty that there is a small light (not too bright) in the switch which shows you where it is in the dark.",5,0,2016-8-16,1,0,0
"The TP-Link Smart WiFi light switch is a great addition to most people's home automation systems.The actual switch is really nice. It has a nice touch to it.

The HS200 light switch is a fantastic device that gives remote control to lights or ceiling fans. Instead of having to get up and walk over to a switch and hit it you can do it all from your cell phone or tablet or any other wireless device that is compatible with the app (apple and android devices).  This is especially convenient in the morning and at night when rest is of the utmost importance and interrupting or delaying it to turn off a glaring light or shut off a chilling fan can be very cumbersome.The device is can also use timers which can be set up to match a schedule. I set mine up so my light turns on in my room right as it gets dark outside. I've also set my fan to cut off around the time I fall asleep. In my room the light and fan are on the same switch. These features could also be used to deter theft by giving the impression that the room and home is occupied.,5,0,2016-7-28,1,0,0

Also, they have a light on the bottom of the switch. It's quite dim, but if you've got them next to non-Kasa switches, they could stick out.The switches are quite deep, so if you don't have a lot of room in your gang box, you might not be able to fit them, or might require a deeper box.",5,0,2019-1-13,1,0,0

I installed it in my garage to turn on the outside lights at dusk and off at dawn.  It has been installed for about 2 months and works flawlessly.

"I don't know the first thing about installing electrical items.  And I was not about to pay an electrician to come out to my house and install the TP-LINK Smart wi-Fi Light Switch.  So it took me a while to get the item installed.  I had to wait for my son (who must have inherited the electrical genes from his mother) to come out to my place for a visit in order to get the light switch installed.  So I have had the light switch sitting around waiting for nearly a month.But the results are impressive.  I was really only concerned with one light in the house...a reading lamp in my bedroom, which is really difficult for me to turn off by hand.  The switch on this lamp is a round metal ball which must be rotated, but it sticks; and I often have to get out of bed when I'm finished reading, and get a napkin or something to turn the switch to ""off.""",5,0,2016-8-15,1,0,0
I've installing this switch and it works very well.  I also have the Wemo wall switch in another location in my home.  Comparing the two I would offer the following:- Setup was very easy and completely trouble free on the TP-Link; joined my network without any issues.  The setup was easier and faster than the comparable Wemo switch.  The Wemo switch was more finicky with regards to the network connection and I had to try a couple of times.

"Very happy and satisfied so far. This is my 6th smart switch and the first TP-Link smart switch. Most of the others are either Wemo switches or Leviton. Wiring installation was straightforward, instructions were clear and all my home is wired with neutral (white wire). Build quality is also good, size is almost comparable to other peers. Initial setup: compared to Wemo smart switch and Wemo Dimmer, setup was a breeze. I could connect to my wifi in less than 2 minutes where-as with Wemo switches, it took close to 1 hour with several attempts to connect to my wifi network. Once connected both Wemo as well as TP-Link switches worked fine, had a stable Wifi connection, iPhone App worked fine as well as with Alexa. The operation using the iPhone App was bit sluggish (3-4 seconds wait time) compared to Wemo / Leviton Apps. When I rebooted my router (for firmware upgrade) or my main switch-box during installation of other devices, all the smart devices re-gained the wifi connection on its own once the router was back online. Only the Leviton smart dimmer switch went offline and never regained connection. I had to start the initial setup again after which it came back online. Both Wemo and TP-Link provide the matching face/wall plate but Leviton didn't provide one. I didn't mind a visit to the Home-Depot to get one but it's still better to have everything ready. Overall, TP-Link switches are highly recommended as they seem to be more reliable and worth every penny as Wemo switches are little more pricey. I hope the sluggish response when using iPhone App will be fixed/resolved in upcoming firmware upgrades. Finally, I wish TP-Link also had the dimmer switch as well. Hope to see the TP-link smart dimmer switches in the market soon.",5,0,2017-8-2,1,0,0
"I am not much of a technician, but I installed two of these switches rather easily, one to control my living room fans and one for my kitchen lights.  I may end up replacing most switches in the house for this thing!  I had a little bit of a surprise when I took off the old switch and there were only 2 black wires connected to it, but the tp link smart switch has 4: two black, one white and one green.  The 2 black wires connect to the old switch 2 black ones in any order.  The neutral inside the wall is not connected directly to the old switch.  You can easily identify it because it has two or more wires bundled up and intertwined and hanging loose inside the box with an electrical cap or electrical tape.  Just add the tp link white wire to the bundle.  I left the green ground wire floating unconnected because my light switch did not have one nor did I see anywhere inside the box to connect it to.  If your old switch has a ground connection, then attach the green wire to it.  You can find videos on YouTube if you are not sure.  The app picked up my wifi with no problem and then Alexa (downstairs) and my Google assistant (upstairs) picked the switch immediately (you have to add the switch to both, of course).  I did not encounter any of the issues others have reported, like having to press the top and the bottom or the switch or losing the wifi signal.  A light touch and the lights come on, and, of course, the commands to Alexa or Google are flawless.  Love it!",5,0,2018-6-26,1,0,0

I purchased this based upon the reliability of other TP-Link products in my home. The online instructions were easy to follow. If you don't feel comfortable about installing any electrical switch you probably want to hire a professional. The only problem I experienced was trying to locate my network and getting it to sync. After a second try it connected and has stayed that way even with a recent power interruption. The Kasa app is easy to work with my Echo. Nice being able to turn on a light before I enter the house (or turning it off if I forget). I will purchase a couple more for other switches. Note: The only problem that you might want to avoid is checking how many wires are bundled into your current switch box. The back side of the switch does take up a bit more room that a standard switch so check before you install.,5,0,2017-7-20,1,0,0

"I purchased Leviton DW15S-1BZ, Wemo Wi-Fi Light Switch, and TP-Link Smart Wi-Fi Light Switch for comparison.The TP-Link Smart Wi-Fi Light Switch was bulky.  Much larger than a regular light switch and larger than the Wemo.  About the same size as the Leviton.  The TP-Link had wires coming out of the unit that must be attached with wire nuts.  This large switch now requires more space in a small electrical light switch box.  The Leviton had lugs, just like a regular light switch which saves space. The indicator light on the switch could have been helpful if it showed the opposite of what it does.  The indicator illuminates when the switch is not in use.  TP-Link claims this is a night time locator.  But for me, the switch is running outdoor lights and I want the indicator to be ON when the lights are ON.  This function cannot be changed on the TP-Link but the Leviton switch allows you to configure the indicator to your liking. You may activate the indicator light to function as a night time locator as the TP-Link or as an indicator to show the switch is active.  The TP-Link may be turned on or off by tapping the bottom of the rectangular switch.  The Leviton functions just like a non-smart switch, tap the top to turn on, tap the bottom to turn off.  I prefer the Leviton operation.  And last, the TP-Link software is functional, but turning on and off lights requires going through more menu buttons than I care for.

"Firstly - TP-Link is one of my favorite home networking hardware suppliers right now. I'm a little sad to be giving the HS200 only four stars.Here's why - I just want to control the switch with Alexa (or wink if I have to). I don't want to create yet another account and keep yet another app installed on my phone. I also don't want to depend on any provider, including TP-Link, to maintain a web server. If that web server dies for any reason then I'm stuck with a switch I can only control locally through a particular app. For example, what if TP-Link got acquired by Cisco or Microsoft and they decided to charge for accounts or shut down the service or something. I expect to live in this house for decades and I expect infrastructure (like light switches) to last for a very long time. The TP-Link server is an unwanted point of failure.",4,0,2016-7-30,1,4,0

Alexa integration. - automatically imported my devices into Alexa once they were setup.What I don't like: 1. The plastic look/feel of the switch.  Dealing with electricity, this isn't something that completely had my mind at ease. Compare it to the Leviton - the Leviton switch feels more substantial and sturdy.  2. The connectivity.  I used this in a switch-box that has three switches. and the space behind the switch has limited space for excess cable/wire.

"If you're looking to make a single switch in your house or business operable over the Internet, this is exactly the device you need.

It survives router resets, Internet outages and all the usual manner of real-life glitches that can happen with these sorts of gadgets.There are a few gotchas to consider though. The depth of unit will not work for all installations, double-pole (i.e. two switch lights) won't work, and if you have metal plate covers, these wreak havoc with the wifi connection. Additionally, for building out a whole wired house with many of these types of switches, this is not a good solution.

"Works great. It was easy to install.  You do have to download the fee ""Kasa"" app but it's cheaper than a Hub. With the app you name the switch and connect it to your network, and enable the Kasa skill in Alexa. Then you can verbally tell Alexa to ""find devices"" which she does in about 20 seconds. From there you can control the switch with Alexa, turn it on and off at the wall, or any combination thereof.  You can also control it remotely with the app. It even has a pale glowing light to it so you can find the switch in the dark.Within the app you can set a schedule, set a one-time timer telling it to turn either on or off after a time you select, and the cool one: set an away mode. You set a time period, repeating every [S M T W T F S] that you'll be away. During that time the switch will turn on and off at random times to make you appear home.",5,0,2016-8-8,1,0,0
Poorly designed product. The Reset and Restart buttons are immediately adjacent to the switch so once a week they are getting accidentally pressed.

"We installed two of these yesterday - one to control our kitchen lights, and the other to control our family room lights (the two most used lights in our home). Since I am not comfortable making electrical outlet connections, the first step was to get a good electrician to install the switches. This was particularly important for our kitchen, where it was a ""three way port"" (two different switches controlling the lights). The electrician disabled one of the switches by disconnecting the red wire behind it. Once he installed the TP Link switches, the wifi setup through the Kasa app was a breeze (to connect/test the app with each of the two switches). If you do this successfully, you can turn on/off your lights from your Kasa app on your phone. NOTE: Make sure your ""devices"" (switches) on the Kasa app are ""remote enabled"" in the device settings. This should be the default, but double check. Also, you will have to create/remember a TP Link ""cloud"" account for your Kasa app (as prompted on that app),  because you will need that userid/password to connect the Alexa Home skill for TP Link to the discoverable devices (which is the final step to enable voice control of the light switch devices through Alexa).We named our TP link switch devices as ""My Kitchen Light"" and ""My Family Room Light"".

However, unlike other TP-Link plug-and-play products, this one requires that you are comfortable with simple electrical wiring to replace an existing 110v switch (or willing to hire an electrician). All you need to complete the installation is a screwdriver, a smartphone, and a wi-fi network. Everything else you need is included in the package.",5,0,2016-7-29,1,0,0
"This product is great and extremely affordable compared to other options. It is very easy to set up and once it is set up, you won't have to worry about it again. Even if your internet connection dies, you can still use it as a manual switch. It has a convenient light on the actually button when the switch is ""off"" that way you can see where it is at night (it's dim enough to not cause unnecessary light in a room). The best part is that it does NOT require a hub or any extra device to work, unlike some other brands.",5,0,2019-1-18,1,0,0
I have 11 TP-Link devices now (6 switches & 5 plugs. Once the first switch was set up (over a year ago) with the Kasa App the remaining 10 (added one at a time over the next several months) were a snap to add and synced automatically with the Alexa App. Have never had a problem with any of them until now. One switch inexplicably dropped off my WiFi network and I had to do a factory reset. Simple and worked but now would not respond to Alexa voice commands. It worked manually and with both the Kasa and Alexa App just not with Alexa voice commands.I emailed TP-Links' tech support on Saturday evening requesting help. Not expecting a response to after the weekend I woke Sunday morning to find TP-Links' Tech Supports reply with 4 suggestions to resolve. First suggestion worked (simply change the device's name in the Kasa App which synced automatically with the Alexa App).,5,0,2018-7-11,1,0,0
"We purchased the Kasa Smart Switch specifically for a yard light we frequently forget to turn off on our deck. We have a Lab-Border Collie mix who loves to go outside frequently to make sure the back yard is “secure”. It seemed like half the time we would let Bella in, get settled back in somewhere, and then realize the deck light was still on. I was thrilled when I found the Kasa Smart Switch just for this specific situation. Now, if it’s forgotten on, not a problem! I pull out my phone or have a quick chat with Alexa and it’s taken care of. This product was a perfect addition to the Kasa Smart Bulbs and Smart Plugs we had already purchased and use regularly.We also just purchased an additional Kasa Smart Switch for our front yard light which has been extremely handy to control remotely.",5,0,2018-4-18,1,0,0
Love this device. I bought it from Fry's electronics.  We are using this device to turn on and off  our water fountain so we do not have to manually do it. It is nice to set a schedule and just forget it.  I also connected it my Amazon echo and Google home which allows me to send voice commands to turn it off and on and get the status. Both Amazon echo and Google home work like a charm. I Installed the device in my garage and it has been running for about a month now. We live in Arizona so our garages can get pretty hot and the switch has not shown any signs of malfunctioning because of the heat.  The software setup was a nice touch as it walked you through wiring setup and then attaching the switch to your network. The only thing that is annoying is that the switch can not find hidden networks. I had to unhide my network attach the device and then hide the network again.  I would like to find more reason around the house to buy more of these switches.  I would recommend this product for sure.,5,0,2017-8-4,1,0,0
"Love this light switch!!. I had it installed for the front porch light.  It works great!!  I love that if we go somewhere and are gone until it's dark, I can turn the light on with my phone! The set up could not have been easier since I already had Kasa installed on my phone. I would love to have these in every room of my house!! This is a review of a free product received from TP-Link as part of the review program.Update......After one week, the amber wifi light would come on in the middle of the night, indicating firmware updating during which the switch wouldn't work.  This switch was next to our living room light switch. After two weeks, when we would turn on the L.R. light, the porch light and spotlights would flicker, even when off. The third week, the amber wifi light came on and stayed on and the porch light and floodlights no longer worked.  We had our electrician remove it and replace our standard switch.",1,0,2016-8-16,1,4,0
"So in order to install this, you need a neutral wire at the switch.  I don't have that where I wanted to put this, or probably anywhere in my house since it was built in the early 70s.  I didn't see that requirement when I ordered it, and waited a few months before trying to install so now I can't return, it's a completely useless device to me. I called the TP-Link about returning it, and found customer service enthusiastic but ultimately frustratingly unhelpful.  My research showed that natural wires only became common after the 1980s, so buyer beware I guess.",1,0,2018-9-11,1,0,0
I love this product. It makes life alittle easy or should I say lazy. With this feature you can turn your light off and on by your phone. You can turn on the light when away from home.

"This light switch had to be installed by our local electrician and my more computer savvy husband had to figure out how to get it to work with our Echo.  Once those two hurdles were jumped, we were in business.  Now, we can lie in bed and have our Echo turn the bedroom lights off and on.  It's quite handy!  We use the Wink hub to control our smart gizmos and this switch doesn't need a hub, but it also doesn't seem to interfere with the rest of our gizmos that do use the hub.  I love smart devices and I will be very glad when they all become plug and play.",5,0,2016-9-4,1,0,0

"This is a review of a free product received from TP-LINK as part of the review program.I think this is a wonderful addition to the smart 'things' product line of TP-Link. I received this about 3 weeks ago and after taking about 10 minutes to install it, the switch has performed just as well as a traditional switch with the added benefit of having additional functionality like turning it on remotely and setting a schedule. I was impressed with the aesthetics of the switch and the accompanying wall plate that comes with it. The wifi connectivity is great as well considering I have mine installed a good 3 rooms (and 1 level) away from my main router and haven't had any signal drops yet.",5,0,2016-7-29,1,0,0

"The install, wifi, app, and smart home integration is all great.

"This is a review of a free product received from TP-LINK as part of the review program.  This is a great switch for basic functionality.  It wire's in to existing locations like any other ""dumb"" switch.  Set-up was easy using TP-LINK's Kasa app.  The app allows for you to set up schedules to turn the switch on/off.  It also allows you to manually switch it on/off remotely.  If you have an Amazon Echo, you can add this to the Echo allowing you to flip the switch using voice commands as well.  Throughout my usage, there were zero problems even after a power outage.All of this being said, however, the decision to buy this really comes down to what you are looking for.  If you have are looking for basic, ""smart"" switch functionality, this is a great option.  It does what it was designed to do perfectly.  Integration with Amazon's Echo line-up (Echo, Dot, Tap) is an added bonus.  However, if you are running a more advanced home automation solution (such as SmartThings, Wink, VeraPlus, etc.), you might want to look elsewhere as there is no integration currently.  Nor is there any integration with IFTTT.  Hopefully, this additional integration will come shortly, as having separate apps to control all of these one-off home-automation products is a real hassle.  The true power of home automation is in the integration of all devices.",4,0,2016-7-25,1,0,0
"I have had great experiences with multiple TP-Link products, but particularly like the light switch I installed for our back yard light.

Great Idea but there are some problems. Current overhead LED light is on a switch and works fine. Install the TP link switch and it flickers on and off. There is insufficient product information to determine the resistor to fix the problem . There is nothing on what to do if you have this problem. I retuned the product for refund. Hopefully they realize this and post the information to resolve this issue.,1,0,2017-7-28,1,0,0
"This is a great switch!  It's a compact design that fits easier into a tight electrical box.  The wires are pre-attached to the switch so I only needed the supplied wire nuts to connect the switch to the power.  The app has also worked well, with Alexa easily identifying the new device.  I plan on purchasing more switches.",5,0,2018-8-1,1,0,0
The switch is excellent quality and works great and has great integration with Alexa. I took off a star because the casing around the switch is a thick plastic and not metal like my regular switches. This makes it very hard to fit it into an existing set of switches without the face plate protruding out. Its also tricky to make it line up with the rest of the switches.,4,0,2020-8-2,1,0,0
No longer have to remember to turn on soffit lights around our house at night and turn them off at daybreak. I love this product and very easy to install.

I bought this switch for the bedroom so that my Fiancé and I wouldn't have to get out of bed to turn off the overhead lights.

"Great Product. Easy to install and setup.  App is straightforward and easy to use.  If you are trying to use it with Amazon Alexa, make sure you turn on remote control in order for Alexa to discover the device.  I knocked off one star because it is only for use with single pole switches that have a neutral wire available.  Meaning that this switch can only be used for a device that is only controlled by one switch (ie. bedroom or bathroom light) and does not work with devices that can be controlled by multiple switches (ie staircase lights where there is a switch at the top and bottom of the staircase, a hallway, etc.).  Unfortunately I didn't realize this until I went to install the three I had ordered. I was able to install one in my bedroom and it works and looks great!  Returned the other two with no problems.

I bought three of these and set them all up at once. One of them will not allow me to control it through Kasa (the app for this product).

It looks like a regular switch but doesn't actually flip. It is a push button and not very satisfying to manually operate. Works well with Amazon echo.

There are a bunch of switches out there. They all seem to work ok but the companion apps that control them are awful. TP Link's Kasa app works great and is easy to use. That is what separates this switch from the rest.,5,0,2019-2-2,1,0,0
"This was very easy to set up, and the Kasa app takes you through the process step by step. Linked fairly easily to my GHM, although it took another day (maybe less than that, I tested out voice switching immediately after linking the switch (fail) and then a day later (pass)) for GHM to detect it. I like the scheduling features, particularly that you can choose to turn switch on/off at sunrise/sunset (no photosensor, it determines the appropriate time based on your location), and the ""AWAY"" feature, which simulates you being home by turning switch on and off at random times. My one downside is that the switch is not dimmable. That will be my next upgrade.",4,0,2018-1-9,1,0,0

Faceplate is VERY hard to remove. Installation is pretty easy other than that. Note: if you have multiple nutral wires connect them all and save yourself some time.

They say no where except on the switch that this is rated for just 0.3 amps.  If you want to run anything through it like a fan or heater it will not work.  I have a heater in my bathroom and it is a couple amps so the switch just kicks off when i try to run it.  Oh well.,1,0,2017-3-18,1,0,0
The switch itself is working pretty good but the the fitment to wall and plate are terrible. I was putting this in a 4 Gang box and after buying a few different style plates to get a good fitment it is a no go. The plastic mounting flange on the switch is to thick and makes the plate stick off of the wall and the switch doesnt even fit in the plate very well at all. I will be returning for another brand to get better fitment.,2,0,2018-7-19,1,0,0

"Hardware installation was straight forward, with three points worth mentioning – 1.  Before considering HS200, please make sure you have access to the neutral wire, it is usually not connected to the regular switch, but present within the j-box.  2.  This is a one way switch.  And 3. In my case, the part of HS200 that goes inside the j-box was larger than my original switch, and it was somewhat challenging to pack all the wires behind the unit in the j-box.Once the hardware was installed, connecting it with the Kasa application was easy.  It connected to the 2.4GHz network, and was all configured within a few minutes.  Now I have full control: The switch is easily controlled via the application and it can be programmed to operate on schedule.  It can also be voice controlled using Amazon Echo, Dot or Tap.  The switch looks nice, and Reset and Restart buttons easily accessible in case there is a need to reboot or reconfigure the unit.",5,0,2016-7-21,1,0,0

"So I purchased 6 of these wall-mounted light switches a couple months ago, but I t took me a while to install them.  My father works with electrical things daily in his line of work, so I thought it would be an easy install.  It wasn't.  Apparently you need a neutral wire present in your existing lightswitch, which is connected to an outlet, or something.  I am still uncertain about it, but it was expense for me to get only two of them installed.  Since my aged house lacked a Neutral wire, I had to call in a licensed electrician.  The time and labor costs well into the hundreds.  This was not including the already steep price of the product, but I had little choice since the Amazon return window already closed (thanks a lot Amazon; sarcastic snicker included).  It would be great if it had a voice activated dimmer (I don't see why that would be hard, given the big price tag).  What was good was the app, or ""Kasa"" app.  It was straightforward and I was able to connect it to my Amazon Alexa Echo App with ease.  So now with a neutral wire my dining room and outside lights work with voice control.  I just wish I knew this information before Amazon and TP-Link sold this to me.  Hmph, no perfect rating for you.",3,1,2017-9-3,1,3,0
"I used this light to finish the last of my kitchen lights.  Now we can turn lights on above the island, table, counter, cabinets and sink all at once or one at a time.  I've got 4 of these switches and 2 of the Kasa plugs working with Alexa in this one room.  The WiFi setup with the Kasa app works very well.  As with all of these special light switches, they require lots of patience to fit inside a double gang (or more) electrical box.  The devices all work very well with Alexa, but I am surprised that the ""group"" has to be rebuilt in the Alexa app and doesn't just copy what the Kasa app has.  At least Alexa does take the Kasa device name.  It's also a little annoying that additional cell phones in the house ave to setup their own Kasa and Alexa apps as well, but it's a minor 1-time inconvenience.  Note that you do need that independent, neutral, always-on, white wire probably jammed in the back of your electrical box...there will probably be like 2 or 3 of wires actually - which is what makes it such a chore to fit the new, deep switch in.  I hope home builders start using giant, over-sized electrical boxes for smart devices, timers, etc.I'm very impressed with how well these devices are working.  In the first we week we did have 1 switch that went offline, but it's been fine since one press of the fix-it button.  I love the little circle of light that comes on when the switch is off, though it takes some getting used to remembering which one to press if you have 2 or more next to each other.  My little brain wants me to press the switch that is lit up when I go to manually turn the light off, but I have to remind myself that ""duh, it's lit up cuz the light is already off"".",5,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"This was the 2nd of my 1st 2 smart devices and I use it for my kitchen light.  I especially appreciate it because I can turn the lights on before I'm in the door, and of course when I'm away I can cycle them at times I choose then and there.  One of the big advantages for me is I roll out of bed and either ask Google Assistant on my phone, or Alexa downstairs (Yeah, she hears me downstairs) to turn on the kitchen lights.  That way I can ease my way, ""Into the light"" and make it easy on my eyes.  I used to turn my back to the kitchen, turn on the lights and walk away to the other room to let my eyes adjust more gradually.  Just to be sure it's mentioned, it can be turned on manually and has a little light on the switch paddle to find it in the dark.  I have not found that light to be too bright at all.Addendum: It is a challenge to get this in the electical box.  There are many tricks, I chose to shim my regular switch that is next to it (with popsicle stick pieces) so that both were at an even depth in the faceplate.  The faceplate is now slightly off the wall on the edges, but OK looking.",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"I have been using smart plugs from TP-Link for quite some time, and I am very happy with them.  So I decided to buy a TP-Link light switch for a porch light.  It was very easy to install (especially after watching the video), it integrated very easily with the Kasa app, and I am able to continue managing all my devices in a single app.  And the option in the app to allow automatic on / off relative to sunset / sunrise *with offsets* is a great feature.  Now that I have confirmed the quality of the product and ease of installation, I am planning to purchase more TP-Link switches to control additional lights and ceiling fans around my house.  I wholeheartedly recommend this product.",5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0

"TP-Link’s Kasa smart line has not once disappointed me with one of their products. While I havent tried everything, and stick to their lighting products, every single one has been bulletproof and easy to use. As with all Kasa products I own, setup was a breeze and took no more then 30 seconds in the application. Given you have the required wires to install this product, just wire it up, open your app and hit the ‘+’ in the top right, from there the app will walk you through setup and in no more then 30 seconds youre done and it can be controlled in your app and on Alexa if you use it. If you have Alexa setup and the app on your phone, once the device is setup in your Kasa app, it will automatically appear in your Alexa app for control as well. The Switch looks great, and is a breeze to use. I putchased this along with a HS220 Kasa Dimmer, and both of them are fantastic. Setting up schedules or using Away Mode is simple, so much so that even my retired parents can use it effectively. The Kasa app also blows the Lutron app out of the water in terms of usability. It super user friendly and easy to understand, set schedules and timers. I would STRONGLY recommend both the Kasa Dimmer(HS220) and Switch(HS200) to anyone interested in putting a little smart lighting in their home. I am also a huge fan and owner of multiple of their Kasa Smart Plug Mini’s(HS105) and they work flawlessly as well. Do yourself a favor and buy this product.The only 2 places Kasa could improve is integrating with Apple HomeKit(which the HS105 Smart Plugs were supposed to until TP-Link went back on that statement which sucks, it was a big reason I got those in the first place, but theyve been such a good quality product ive gotten over it)...as well as actually using a true ‘Rocker’ on their smart switches and Dimmers rather then a fake ‘Rocker-looking’ button. Other then that these are perfect!",5,0,2020-1-14,1,0,0

"Muy buena inversion para tu casa me gusto bastante ya que puedo programar y decidir a que horas prender el foco junto con la alarma, ademas si lo tienes conectado a una alexa esta perfecto para sacarle el maximo rendimiento a tu alexa , puedes prenderlo y apagarlo mientras estas fuera de casa, no consume mucho internet ni se siente pero debe  llegar por lo menos la señal moderadamente, en la instalación si tienes conocimientos de electricidad no te sera muy difícil es como conectar un contacto y a la vez un apagador, en el mismo software te va diciendo como hacerlo, solo una cosa, yo no lo conecte a tierra física y no he tenido problemas.  y en el precio yo lo conseguí en 378 , es un buen precio para algo que es de marca reconocida, ya que hay mas caros",5,1,2019-12-26,0,1,1

"Lo utilizo con un Amazon Echo (Alexa) y funciona a la perfección, no tuve problema para que lo encontrara y funciona sin problema. Mi único problema fue al instalarlo, por lo que veo, en México no es muy común que se instale el cable ""neutral"" en los apagadores y este FORZOSAMENTE necesita un cable neutro. Un  electricista lo instaló en 15 minutos.El cable neutro va del apagador a la lámpara por lo que no es nada complicado instalar. Me cobraron 200 pesos.",4,1,2018-12-3,0,4,0
Got these yesterday.  I installed two side by side into a 3 gang box with a normal switch.  Each switch controls its own bank of lights.  Was a very tight squeeze to fit it all but I got it to work.  Connecting the switches to wifi was the hard part.  First switch connected perfectly first try.  Second one I had to reset and restart a few time to get it connected.  In the end both are working perfectly.,5,1,2018-4-20,0,1,1

"This is a wonderful, easy to install, and very slick looking product. It looks and feels like a very high-quality product. This switch would easily be at home in a multi-million dollar home.My only issue is that the switch is limited to one type of plain old one-way switch installation. It seems that my home is wired with mostly power-through and two-way switches. Both types are incompatible with this switch. Fortunately, I found (only) two regular one-way switches in my home.",4,1,2017-8-7,0,1,0
"Estuve tratando de decidir entre varios interruptores inteligentes, una de las razones además del precio del porque elegí este fue que la aplicación para smartphone es bastante intuitiva y fácil de usar, además de las funciones que provee bastantes útiles y sin problemas de conexión. Al principio no contaba con internet por lo que únicamente podía usarlo directamente conectado al celular, aún así responde muy bien y tiene gran alcance, al menos en una casa pequeña en cualquier rincón pude encender y apagar las luces a la que estaba conectado.Lo recomiendo mucho, lo único que me gustaría es que hubieran más modelos que tuvieran más apagadores en una sola placa para poder tener más opción de reemplazar los que hay actualmente en las casas.",5,1,2018-12-31,0,6,0
"Delivered on time and works great.  However - I bought 2 of these (one from another seller).  I installed the first one in a single-gang box.  The box already had a few wires in it, and the TP-Link smart switch is so big that I couldn't get it into the switch box, as it was crushing the wires behind it.  I had to pull all the wires out and cut them back as far as I dared, and force the TP-Link in.  It took several tries, including shorting out the circuit and having to re-establish the Wi-Fi link several times.  All in all, it took me about 2 hours.  TP-Link needs to reduce the depth of the unit, so that wires can fit in behind it.The second unit, I installed in a 3-gang box.  Good, I thought, more room to push the wires aside so the TP-Link will install easier - wrong !  The TP-Link barely fit, but it's manufactured such that when you try to put the cover plate back on, the TP-Link does not line up with the cutout the way the other switches do.  It's about 1/16"" too low, but that's just enough to stop the cover plate from going on.  It's also thicker than normal switches, so the cover plate stuck out from the wall.",3,1,2019-1-2,0,5,0
"I call these my pizza lights. I bought these to replace my switches in the lobby area of my house, both the indoor lobby and outdoor porch light. The wiring in my house is... not great. As an electrician I can see that whoever last wired the switches did a terrible job and made installing these switches that much harder. They left almost nothing for the neutral.Before you begin installing these switches, I must recommend you DO NOT install two side by side. Only one in a gang box. Two side by side is a nightmare to wire properly, as there is not enough room in the box for all the wires without forcing the switches in with all your body weight, and hoping nothing pops out or disconnects later. I hated installing this. It should have only taken an hour max to install, from the moment the breaker is turned off, to the moment it's in the app and I'm telling Alexa to turn the lights on and off. Instead, it took 4 hours trying to figure out what the wiring was for the house. For me, these are the pros and cons:",4,1,2018-5-19,0,6,1

Mis bocinas echo no tuvieron problema para detectarlo (bajando el Skill correspondiente) y ahora puedo prender y apagar las luces desde cualquiera de mis bocinas echo o desde mi celular Android.Me tardé un poco en hacer la instalación del apagador, debido a que mi instalación eléctrica no cuenta con distinción entre fase y neutro, además de que la caja en la que iba a poner el apagador no contaba con un cable neutro, por lo que tuve que meter un cable extra por el tubo naranja de cables eléctricos, pero valió la pena todo el trabajo (lo hice como en medio día).",5,1,2020-2-23,0,2,0
I’m not a electrician but this smart light switch is very easy to install and to connect to wifi. You just need to research the difference between “single poll” and “3way” in order to invest $ on the correct lights/switch setup is the price is different.That being said it took me 5 min to wire and cap the new smart switch into place.

"I been wanting to get a Smart Switch for very long time, but never got around because of Questionable Brand, Questionable Quality and Price. Then one day I finally pulled the trigger and got my first Smart Switch. The idea behind this came from annoyance of pre-existing Timer Switch that was getting annoying and no one really knew how to use since the Manual was long lost and it was as intuitive as a brick. So after finally getting annoyed and being bored out of my mind because of certain life quality changes that have occurred for most part of 2020 I decided to do something.My exterior wall lights were due for a refresh, as they were the original 20+ year old lights that where put in when the house was built. I wasn’t originally planning on replacing them, but after trying to service them which became a hassle because someone already stripped the screws, I decided to just get new exterior wall lights. So got in the car, waited 1 hour in line and bang I had brand new set of exterior modern looking LED wall lights that where $35 CAD for a pair over at Home Depot.",4,1,2020-8-10,0,0,0
I don't have any major complaints about this product per se. The switch works fine. I just had higher expectations from a TP Link product.Here are my main criticisms though;,3,1,2020-9-8,0,0,0
Both my husband and I are licensed electricians and we do not recommend this switch. It's cheaply made and does not fit properly in every electrical box. It's very large so if you happen to have an older house or there are more wires in the box (typical) you Will have a hard time with this. I would steer clear of it. There are better ones on the amazon market. Good luck.,1,1,2019-12-1,0,2,0
"Works great. The app came with easy to follow installation instructions. WiFi communication with the device is very responsive with virtually zero delay when you control it through the app. However controlling through Alexa do have a split second, but it works fine. I have a relatively low loading  on the light fixtures of less than 30W total, one being a 9W LED and it worked without any flickering or anything. I plan on installing 2 more of those 9W LED fixtures. One thing I prefer differently is the physical switch to be more mechanical click on/off instead of the digital style of on/off. The way this switch's button works is you click it and it goes on/off but the button itself stays in the same position forever. Like I've said, it works even with minimal loading without flickering AND this is cheaper than the many older style non-WiFi programmable switch that requires a minimum loading requirement in order to work (usually 40W).",4,1,2018-5-30,0,2,0

"Every Kasa product we add, makes our lives a little bit better! We use it with Google Home, so haven’t tried the Alexa route.The Kasa app is great, and these are easy to setup. Installation can be a little tough as the box is much larger than your average box being inserted. However, once you have it installed, it works amazing. Ensure you have a wifi with 2.4Ghz signal. I use the TP-Link Deco M9, which covers us for everything needed. Setup is easy, and since I’ve linked Kasa with Google Home, all new devices automatically add to our google app, and google Nest recognizes it too. We have slowly added more and more Kasa products to our home, because they are so convenient and easy to use. I also use IFTTT with Kasa, to add some special commands for location settings when arriving home, creating scenes, conjunction with a camera, and with Google Nest.",5,1,2020-1-22,0,1,0
"I've purchased a number of these switches and plugs over the last 2 years. They used to work flawlessly with Alexa. I had a router failure so I reset all my devices to work on a new wifi. Since then i can not turn on remote control of them or have Alexa control them. I've done everything, reset Alexa, remove and reinstall all the devices on both the Alexa and Kasa apps, reset all the devices, renamed them, change the time zone and back again, disabled and enabled the app, uninstall the apps and reinstalled,  checked all the permission settings, even fixed the old router and tried again, no luck. Reached out to tech support at TP Link, no response. Nothing seems to work except local control. Even the remote control toggle is missing from most of the devices now in the Kasa app. Some devices won't update the firmware.  I keep getting a ""failure:another cmd is running "" when I try to toggle remote control. Time is synced, time zone is set correctly....do not recommend purchasing.",2,1,2020-3-14,0,0,0
"The TP-Link (HS-200 = single pole) light switch, like the plug (HS-105), works beautifully and simply with the Kasa control system on an iPhone (and likely any smartphone). I really like the control system because it is relatively easy to figure out how to set up timers, schedules and scenes.The HUGE disappointment for the HS200 was the size of the box on the backside of the switch. What were they thinking? Did they not realize that many older homes have electrical boxes of limited size. I am not talking about the depth of the box - there was lots of room for the wires behind the unit. But the up/down dimensions of the backside of the switch were so tight to the top and bottom of the electrical boxes in my older (1950's) house that I had to (1) mount the switch in the centre of a 3-gang box and (2) Jimmy, push, shove and pound the switch to get it in.",2,1,2019-1-18,0,1,0
"Problem:Huge problem after 3 months of use. Basically to turn on/off a switch you simply press the button. The problem I am having is every time I press the button it will just double ""press"" itself. So if it is off and i press the button, the switch will turn on and off again in quick fashion. It took me about 5 tries on average and used my slightest touch to get the switch to turn on/off proper. Basically the switch double click itself. It gets to a point I have to use mobile app to turn on and off switch.",1,1,2019-3-23,0,1,0
"These things are awesome.  Smart Home means you can control through voice, smartphone app, and of course the switch itself.  Configuration and programming options mean that this switch can be on any schedule you can think of and even a sunset/sunrise schedule.  Installation instructions are comprehensive and easy to follow.The downside is that the electrical box that the switch is being installed in must have a neutral wire running through it.  This supplies power to the smart switch independently of the wiring from the switch that turns the light on and off.  Many old homes have a mix of both, and in our case there are several boxes that we cannot install smart switches unless we were willing to pay someone to run the wiring which means lots of drywall cutting and repairing and painting!",5,1,2019-8-12,0,0,0

Very easy to install. Make sure you have a smartphone or tablet with you during install to follow step-by-step installation that is provided along with animation. I also found a general purpose home improvement guide to be useful to confirm steps when it comes to wiring. Another very important tool to have handy is a live-line tester. I picked up one at a local home hardware store for $6. The device is installed reasonably far from my wifi router but never had any lost signal issues. I have had it working for about a month now and no issues.The Android App could use some more contextual help to explain things like 'away' mode and other modes.

"I bought one of these smart TP-Link light switches back in February when they were on sale, to compliment my two Amazon Echo devices. I have since bought another two. Each time, I waited until they were on sale ($29) before buying. Even though I like these switches, I would not pay the full prize to buy them. But at a little over half the normal price, they are totally worth it.Installing one of these switches is relatively easy, assuming that you know what to do and feel comfortable working with electrical wiring and making electrical connections. You do need the original switch that you are replacing to have a neutral (white) wire so bear that in mind if you are planning to replace a switch in an old house with old wiring that doesn’t have neutral. The switch is a little bigger than a regular switch but it in my case, all 3 switches fit in quite well after I installed them. I used the included snap-on decora faceplates with two of the switches and although it took some effort, they snapped on flash with the wall. In the kitchen, I replaced only one of the two light switches that sit side by side and it took some effort to screw back on the old dual switch decora faceplate. The smart switch stuck out a little more than the other switch and as a result the plate didn’t sit flash with the wall on one side, leaving a narrow gap between the plate and the wall. But I used some caulk and it doesn't look too bad ... I think. Actually, in my case the hardest part, was removing the faceplate from the smart switch. It comes attached to the switch out of the box and you have to snap it off it before you can install the switch. But with some effort I managed to get the faceplace off without breaking it or the switch.",5,1,2018-5-1,0,0,0

The switches themselves are hard to push on and off manually. I have other Kasa products installed and they work ok. The Kasa app always says they are turned on when they are not and Alexa can’t find the switches or plugs for voice automation.

"You really do need to check your gang boxes very closely before buying these. My issue was not a neutral wire, but how tightly packed it was. These things are pretty massive. So if there's any obstruction, it's not gonna fit. You can almost forget trying to fit two of them in a single box because it's very tight with the wiring.I got one to fit after a lot of struggle. The switch works fine, there is a bit of a delay between press and light coming on. I'm not crazy about the rocker either, but it's better than other smart switches that just have a flat sensor. The rocker feels a bit cheap, makes a squeaky sound.",4,1,2018-12-22,0,0,0

So, my verdict, they are decent for the price, but unstable most of the time.  Nonetheless, except zigbee and zwave, they can be used with IFTTT, Smartthings, Alexa or Google Home. It is a good choice if you are on a budget and not worse than other products 3 times more expensive and equally unreliable.

The switch itself feels solid.We are using it with the Kasa App on several apple iOS devices.  The app and the switch quickly connected and the switch was super simple to configure.  It was connected to our network in less than 3 minutes.  The Kasa app is very straight forward and works really well.  I was able to program the switch to come on at sunset in our location and it worked right at sunset.  (bonus, never having to adjust the time the outside lights come on!). We can program them to go off at different times on different days too.  (later on Friday and Saturday night for example). Very pleased.  Also, the app can connect from multiple devices.

"Nice switch.  Hot in and power out wires are interchangeable, which saves a little time confirming which black wire is which.  I like the Kasa app, seems to be one of the better thought out light and outlet controllers designed for Android.I didn't use the faceplate that came with the switch because the switch is mounted in a gang box with two other light switches.  The switch fits with the Leviton Decora faceplate.  The only slight snag, and it is slight, is the holes in the plastic for the faceplate screws are not tapped.  I ran a #8-32 tap through, but I think that may have been a bit overkill.  I think you could just use the screws themselves to create the thread as it is just plastic.",5,1,2017-5-4,0,2,0

"Works great! It does exactly what I want and looks great doing it. I love the ""away"" feature and the glowing switch when off. The switch itself is a momentary switch which takes a little getting used to but I think I like it. The decora cover looks much better than the typical vanilla cover. Timer function works reliably. At the price I purchased ($35 CAD) I consider it a deal.Cons: Not much to gripe about. The Kasa app is pretty intuitive. However, I do find that the app's widget is not very reliable. You can set scenes and activate them via the widget. But after waking my phone from lock mode the widget often doesn't work or the scenes are missing. This means I have to open the app to control the lights. It's possibly an issue with my phone but my other home automation widgets aren't affected so I doubt it. If you're using voice control (Alexa, google home, etc) then it's probably not a big issue.",5,1,2018-3-27,0,0,0
Funciona perfectamente pero para instalarlo se necesita alguien que sepa de electricidad ya que el equipo requiere de un cable neutro y los apagadores normales no cuentan con este cable y hay que instalar este cable desde el foco hasta el apagador pero ya que esta instalado funciona perfectamente yo lo recomiendo ampliamente,5,1,2019-10-17,0,1,1

"I purchased this switch to add more functionality to the families Alexa system and it was exactly as advertised with the switch being easy to install (as long as you know how to connect electrical wires safely) and easy to integrate with Alexa through the smart switch app and so forth. However, we were unable to install it permanently as the switch was purchased as a gift for a family member and we were unaware that the switch we wanted to replace had no neutral wire, so you definitely should double check and ensure that the wiring is right (even if it may be difficult to check without the recipient of the gift seeing what you are doing) so that the switch works correctly. Also due to the error mentioned earlier we were unable to test the  timer function. We plan to use the switch elsewhere in a place that has a neutral wire so not all is lost.

"I bought this switch both to start automating the house and to replace a dimmer that controlled an outlet in a room that has no overhead light.  Why someone thought a dimmer was a good idea for that I have no clue.  I have had a few stand lamps plugged into that outlet and if the dimmer wasn't fully on, the light would flicker and there would be this horrid whining noise.  I don't have a lot of electrical experience, but I was able to do the wiring pretty easily after watching a few youtube videos and following the steps in the app, which I suggest downloading to your device first before you install it for just this reason.  However the box for the switch itself is quite large, so it took a fair amount of carefully arranging the wires and some force to get it in there.  Once installed however it works flawlessly, from the app, from the google assistant on my phone and from the Google Home Mini.  We had a major power outage recently and had no issues with its connectivity afterward. The switch even has a small circle on the bottom half that has a soft glow to it, making it easier to find in the dark, but not so bright that it's intrusive. And I no longer have to fuss with the stupid dimmer.  I intend to buy more of these, but like many things on Amazon, the price fluctuates quite a bit, so I will wait until it drops again.",4,1,2018-3-20,0,1,0
"I installed this smart switch in a 3 gang box, standard depth. This wall box was also being used as a junction box for a few other wires so it was crowded in there. The first thing I did was move the other switches out of the way and verify that this switch still fit in a completely empty spot in that box, which it barely did. However it consumes all of the vertical space and at the deepest part of the back (back face is angled) it touches the back of the box if the wires the coming out of it aren't positioned correctly. So after confirming that it will fit I set about rearranging the rest of the wires in that box and connecting the switch. With everything in there I managed to get the top of the switch flush with the wall and the bottom protruded about 3/32"". However, even with that pretty good fitment (considering the size of this switch in a tight space) the face plate was protruding from the wall at both the top and moreso the bottom due to the thickness of the switch's mounting flange; in order to have any strength the plastic flange is considerably thicker than the metal flange on a normal switch or receptacle. Now I see why they include that super thick face plate in the kit.Once installed though the switch works well. It set up fine and pulled new FW which gives me confidence that TP-Link still be supporting the this device, moreso than products from some lesser known brands.",4,1,2018-12-10,0,0,0

I have two of these now plus a Tp-Link mini plug. These work best in a single gang box. The first one I bought was for a double gang and that was a tighter fit than I expected. The other issue was getting a regular switch cover to fit the switch in the double gang. I had to trim off some drywall to get it to sit further into the wall so the cover sat flush with the wall. While getting the install cosmetics right were a bit of a hassle I think the tech works flawlessly. The app works great and I have this integrated with Google Assistant and Home Assistant.

"For the price, you cannot complain about how they work. The only problem I have ran into on this last install was that my electrician used a 4 gang + 1 gang boxes to create a 5 gang box total. Using non-smart enabled switches you are given the spacing and movement (left/right) to make the face plate fit, but since there is a larger box behind these switches you need to make sure that everything is in one box.

"I gave this 4 stars because the wiring instructions are not all that clear.  When it says a neutral wire is required, that is because most normal wall switches simply add a break in the hot line so if the switch is off, essentially the switch gets no power so is getting no wifi signal to control it.  What the neutral wire does is provide a return path for constant power to the switch so that the ""smart"" side of it is always on.  The first time I went to install this, the wiring to the switch had no white neutral wire, so I figured it would not work.  After viewing a YouTube video of the installation, I went back into the wall junction box to find a bundle of white neutral wires all junctioned together at the back of the box, so simply took off the cap and tied the switch's white wire into that bundle, and put the two black wires connected to the prior switch's hot wires.  Everything was up and running in minutes after that.",4,1,2018-11-9,0,0,0

In the end, my outlet sits 2-3mm off the wall and not flush as there simply isn't enough room. If you were renovating a home and starting clean with outlets, you could always use a much larger wall socket to allow for the cables, however in a pre-built home where I don't have the luxury or ripping out the electrical box, it is an issue that needs to be addressed.",4,1,2019-11-22,0,0,0
I love kasa products as they are so easy to install and connect with the app. This switch was very easy to install and my only gripe is that it is a bit bulky in the rear.

Very trivial tasks if you don't have much electrical knowledge, but the experience may vary if 1. your house wiring was done by a cut rate electrician who didn't use the right color wires or 2. There's a missing/hard to reach earth and/or neutral wires. I personally had some issues getting the switch to fit in. My switch box had very thick solid copper wires which took up a lot of space.

I have tried other brands with the same functions as smart switches as well as manual switches with sensors.

Company has sales as well for more costly versions that have dimmer and 3 way functions.  By patient and wait for sales to get $10 off or more off regular prices for  these products.  No brainer.

"This is replacing my Woods Wion that was recalled and  I will say that it is far more stable and the functionality is about the same.  I installed this in a three gang box and it was a nightmare.  Instead of connecting the wires directly to the switch like other models, this unit has additional 3-4"" of wire length you need to accommodate in a very small space.  It also doesn't mount flush with the wall, it's thicker than standard switches so I had to chip out my drywall in order to get the triple face place back on and have everything line up.

Either get a 2.5 inch deep wall box (lots of work) or one or two 1/16th wall switch plate extenders (a lot less work).,5,1,2020-3-22,0,0,0

"I've installed light fixtures and replaced receptacles before, so I'm not shy with electrical work, but this product is a whole different level of tricky.It requires 4 electrical lines in your socket.

"Terrific smart switches. With a little monkeying around you can make them work with IFTTT, and out of the box they work with Google Assistant. It's nice to be able to see if the bathroom fan is on when I get to work, or shut off the porch light from bed.Note: If you have 2x4 construction walls then you may have issues fitting them in electrical boxes. You'll have to make a spacer for the wallplate. I have an older mobile home I had to do this on. Jigsaw, some spruce board, and paint can do the trick easily though.

"Conecté este interruptor a un ""contractor"" eléctrico de 30 amperes. El interruptor es de 15 amperes y tengo un calentador de agua eléctrico de 18 amperes que necesitaba controlar por medio de Alexa. Como no podía utilizar el interruptor directamente en el calentador de agua debido a la diferencia de amperaje, a mi electricista se le ocurrió utilizar un contractor, que es el interruptor que apaga y enciende el calentador de agua. Y este interruptor Wi-Fi está conectado al contractor para encenderlo y apagarlo. El electricista tuvo que insertar un nuevo cableado para el neutral desde el centro de carga de mi casa, así como cableado para la tierra. El electricista me cobró $1,500 pesos por todo (unos $80 dlls +/-).Una vez instalado, fue bastante sencillo conectarlo a Internet con la aplicación Kasa Smart de TP-Link y posteriormente a mi sistema Amazon Echo para controlarlo con Alexa o por medio del teléfono.",5,1,2019-3-4,0,1,0

This is the third of these I have installed and all have been completely trouble-free. It is now my default choice for a simple smart switch.

Great little switch. Works exactly as expected and the software is easy enough to use. Only hang up I had was the thickness of the plug itself. It's much thicker than a standard switch which means the plate cover doesn't sit flat if you use it in a multi gang box. I had to shave down the drywall behind it to get the plate in my 4 gang box to sit flush.
