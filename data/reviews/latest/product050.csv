"I wanted to like this, but so many issues prevent me from keeping it. I didn't have high expectations, nor high needs.. It was for my garage to keep an eye on the door. Simple. Well, problem after problem, and now the night vision is only firing at half strength. These are neat, but not ready for prime time. Heck, these can't even download video... Oh, and try searching for something.... Good luck.",1,1,2018-2-11,1,1,0
"As a loyal dropcam guy I really wanted to like this cheaper alternative; however, for security purposes it is about useless. I just assumed the recording length would be as long as movement is detected. This is not the case. you will get one 12-14 second recording and then it will take significant amount of time for it to record another 12 - 14 second clip (3-5 minutes). My point being is if you're using this as a a security camera it's absolutely pointless. You may catch a person entering your domain but you won't get much more than that due to the time allotted. I would even venture to say that you probably won't get a good look at the perp until long after the 12 seconds they give you. Forget about seeing what the perp took. Having a micro SD card is pointless as well because if it's seen or recognized there is nothing stopping the thief from taking your cam (with micro sd inserted) and rolling out with it. This was a good effort but fails on nearly every security front. On a side note I was not expecting amazing quality of the footage considering the price and they pretty much delivered what was expected (bad quality picture over gigabit speeds). If you're using this for a nanny cam you might be in luck. If you are using this for a security camera you might as well keep on looking.",1,1,2018-2-7,1,3,0
"I bought three of these cameras through Amazon and the newest model through Wyze.  I had no problems on the first three with regard to setup and they work fine.  The latest model might work fine also but Wyze changed the charging cord to two male end usb.  Unfortunately they included the wrong charging cord.  I have been trying to get these people on the phone to discuss the situation. BEWARE. when purchasing these cameras, you may not get through to customer service.  I called five times.  Three times I was told by the automated attendant to call back later.  Twice the automated attendant told me that the hold time was three minutes.  No problem, I held.  When my turn arrived the automated attendant told me to call back later.  If you buy these cameras you are on your own.Follow up post:  ok, dummy me.  Found the correct opening for the charger wire.  It wasn’t obvious but when I tried to send an email to Wyze, the solution popped up in the email.  Others must have had the same problem.  Nevertheless, it doesn’t excuse the poor customer support.  Moreover, the posts about the camera “spying” are disturbing.  I will leave my post at one star.",1,1,2018-12-6,1,1,0
"Initially I thought these cameras were GREAT! But after using and testing these cameras I have discovered what I believe to be a FATAL problem with these cameras.I use these cameras for security / monitoring so I expect them to record no matter what as long as the camera has power. What I did not realize was that if WIFI goes down, the cameras will STOP recording even though I have an SD card and the cameras are set to record continuously.",1,1,2019-1-10,1,1,0

"I am updating my earlier “thumbs up” review and modifying it. Wyze issued firmware & app updates two days ago and since that time, their product is useless and doesn’t work at all. I am now revising my review to “caveat emptor” (let the buyer beware) and suggesting a hold against any consideration of purchasing anything from this company.Original Review ...",1,1,2018-2-10,1,1,0
I was really excited to try this out because I needed to catch someone stealing packages.I followed the instructions to a T. They're pretty straight forward and it honestly takes about 2 minutes to setup on the app.,1,1,2019-1-24,1,5,0
"Good inexpensive basic camera. Picture quality is good, but not very feature rich, smart home-wise. Storage is free 14 days from recording via Amazon cloud, which is nice. Camera feed is reachable only trough their iOS or Android app, but No Alexa or smart integration at this time, so you can't set it to record when you leave or have IFTTT integration. I think that's one of the only drawbacks I can see...****EDIT: Upgrading one star, did some digging and found a super hacky way to get these cameras to work via IFTTT w/Smart Things. It only worked with a wi-fi smart plug. First, I had to create scenes via the app for the plugs, then I had to go into the dev settings for SmartThings and add devices. I had to connect the account for the plugs to IFTTT. Now the cameras power on when IFTTT notices I've left the house and turn off when I return home. They are powered off when I'm at home (I don't want them recording me walking around sending motion alerts!) and turn on when I'm away. So far, so good.",4,1,2017-12-4,1,2,0
Bought 2 of these and was going to use as a babycam essentially.Video quality was pretty good.,4,1,2018-5-5,1,7,0
"This camera is cheap, but there are many flaws, but one fatal flaw...Obviously most don't want their cameras running continuously, so you will rely on motion detection for capture and alerts. Unlike other cameras that use actual motion to wake the camera, the Wyze uses pixels and light. If car headlights or a passing cloud changes the light the camera will record and send you an alert.  But even so, when someone does come into the picture and wakens the camera, by the time it starts recording you may not get but a second or so to see who has passed by.  Even then, low light capability is atrocious, even with the low light function turned on. It may be ok for continuous surveillance as a baby monitor in normal light,  but it is definitely not a security device that you can rely on.",1,1,2018-12-1,1,4,0
"I never used this product. I unboxed it and then downloaded the app & read the user agreement and absolutely cannot consent to the terms. Please read and understand the clause about subrogation claims BEFORE you use this product. It puts the user at admittedly unlikely, but very real legal and financial jeopardy in the event of the product failing in such a manner that harm is caused- for example the cord catching fire. USER is repsonsible for all legal fees or fines/claims against the product EVEN if the product was at fault! For me, being someone who just lost a home in a fire with a product that is being pursued under subrogation by my insurance company there is NO WAY I would consent to this!!",1,1,2018-12-13,1,1,0
I've had this camera for a couple of days and the connection is very spotty. There's no smooth video and the app is constantly showing that the camera is connecting with no successful connection half the time. Note that this is not compatible with 5G Wi-Fi (802.11ac).,2,1,2017-11-24,1,7,0
"I love this WYZE camera!  This is the 6th one I have purchased!  For the price, you can't do better.  I have this camera mounted outside, I purchased the little ""house"" available here on Amazon, and so far so good!  I have a great view of my driveway!  I already have two other WYZE cameras outside, one protecting my front door and one protecting the back door, and they work great during the day or night.  I have had those outside since Frb and they have survived cold, snow, and rain. I don't use the alerts, so I can't comment on them.  I record directly to SD cards.  The picture is clear and the app is useful.  I also have three Amazon Cloud Cameras too, which I also love, however I have to say, these WYZE cameras have more features, recording to an SD card for one, then the Cloud cameras have.  Plus these WYZE cameras are a quarter of the price!  I have one camera pointing outside through my living room window.  I have to turn off the night vision due to reflection, however i get a great view!  I wish I could think of more places I need to monitor, I would buy more WYZE cameras!",5,1,2018-5-9,1,1,1
"I want to begin by saying that I have been very interested in owning security cameras in my home, but I've never wanted to spend a bunch of money on it. I heard about this camera through a tech news article and I thought that I would give it a shot. After all, a $30 1080p security camera with some free cloud storage just seemed to good to be true.What I like:",3,1,2017-11-2,1,3,0
"The camera video quality is definitely good, but there is no privacy... Since there is no way to use the camera locally without their app and just using a regular app like ""ip cam viewer"" that simply uses RTSP, I ended up putting an SD card on it and disabling its internet access by assigning an IP that is restricted by my router...Well, to my surprise, the camera is CHINESE intelligent and decided to change its macaddress to a new one (completely different from the one in the back label) in order to gain a new IP from my router and regain internet access.",1,0,2017-11-28,1,8,0
"Not sure about how secure it is. They say they utilize a 3rd party called ThroughTek (offices in china and japan - none in US) to handle the transfer of videos. Wyze Cam claims the content is sent securely to aws. Examining the network traffic from camera shows that content is routed thru many providers including AWS, Linode (US) Vultr/Choopa (europe) and Aliyum/Alibaba (china). They seem to also utilize NTP server in Russia. To get more details.. search on web for ""WyzeCam sending data to servers other than AWS"" and you will find a Reddit article. How does Wyze ensure that ThroughTek is not eavesdropping?For me to trust Wyze Cam, I need to have clear control over end to end encryption of my data to ensure no 3rd party has any way of accessing my videos. Why can't the data be sent directly from my cam to AWS (s3 bucket)? Why can I not have access to AWS logs (s3 logs) to review which other IP address has accessed (or attempted to access) my content? Just claiming that this is a secure solution, doesn't work for me.",1,0,2017-11-27,1,6,0
"Fantastic camera, regardless of the price!  We have a half dozen webcams scattered around the house, both inside and outside, that we use for security monitoring when we are away.  Over the years I've installed cameras from Linksys, Foscam, Insteon and Wansview (NOTE: Foscam, Insteon and Wansview are, for all intents and purposes, the same camera).  All of them have gotten the job done, and have cost anywhere from $50-$100 dollars.  But after trying out this little camera, I'll never buy anything else again.  At least not for indoor use.PROS:",5,1,2017-11-28,1,7,0
"Camera would be great if it was consistently working. It works for a few minutes and then when I try to View it says connection failed. And nothing I do can get it to come back up. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone... nothing works",1,1,2017-12-13,1,4,0

"Sad to say I purchased an additional 2 before my original 2 cameras stopped functioning.  Originally live stream stopped and now alerts do not work.  Wyze responded they were researching my trouble ticket.  I still have the two in their boxes and am about to send them back.  Too bad, they were great cameras with lots of features.  I told lots of people to purchase before and now I hope they did not listen to me.If you purchase do not upgrade the firmware because I believe that is what stopped my cameras from functioning.  Normally, I do not upgrade firmware on electronics unless they do not work, but I did not listen to my own advice.",1,1,2018-2-24,1,4,0
"I got this camera some time ago because another Amazon user said it worked with the RTSP standard used by computers, security systems, and digital video recording software. I really wanted to like it, but found that it didn't have RTSP capability. That meant it could only be used with a smartphone app; it could not be used with computers or security systems.Recently, Wyze added RTSP support. That means you are not limited to using this camera with just their smartphone app. It now works with your desktop computer, and if you have a DVR or a home security system, it works with that too. So I tried this camera out again.",5,1,2018-12-8,1,3,1
"Excellent video and night vision quality. Camera is outside nearly 60 feet from the WIFI router and working fine. Only problem I've encountered is the live stream video is only accessible on my Google Pixel phone intermittently...when I'm out of WIFI range away from home.  At home on WIFI, no problem. Email notifications for movement are almost instantaneous. These cameras rival the more expensive brands out there, and actually offer a more user friendly interface.****Update*****  I have discovered that I cannot access my cameras remotely via my Android phone/Wyze app during daylight hours....Wyze representative responded promptly to my inquiry regarding this problem after we ran a connection test, stating the problem was with my ISP, not WYZE.  Curiously, after about 7 pm until 6:15 a.m. I am able to access my live feed remotely via my Android phone.  While at home on my WiFi network, the camera live feed is accessible 24/7....I do not have this problem with my Nestcam...I can bring up the live feed any time of the night or day, at home or away from home, using my Android phone....same network, same WiFi.......interestingly, I do receive the motion alert videos on WYZE remotely on my phone 24/7, just no live feed access during the day.  This problem occurs at the exact same time every day.",4,1,2018-2-11,1,5,1
"I was a fan of the camera until yesterday. I recently updated the firmware on this camera, and virtually immediately thereafter my network was attacked and one server was turned into a crytocurrency miner, as well as being used to attack other machines. I didn't notice this for several days, but according to my logs this began right after the firmware update. Looking at reddit, and some of the responses from the Wyze dev, this device and all of the firmware comes from third parties in China, who also manage the cloud storage and the firmware updates. Stay away! Wyze might be a good company, but they are apparently being taken advantage of in dealing with their overseas ""partners"". It's too good to be true for $20.",1,1,2019-4-2,1,2,0
"I've had this for a few days now. It was very easy to setup, do the firmware upgrade etc. But it just keeps disconnecting or not finding the camera. I'm not interested in any of the motion features like other buyers are, but those don't work either. I haven't been able to turn them on or off. Generally speaking, it works here and there and typically I can't connect for more than a few minutes (tops).",1,1,2017-11-28,1,9,0
"The hardware is pretty dang good for the price. 1920x1080 good ""security camera"" quality picture and decent infrared LED illumination for night. Decent mounting system although not very flexible pan or tilt when mounting on a wall, works best either upside down or just sitting on a flat surface. Power cord is just about 2 meters, so not really long enough for most mounting applications but fine if you are setting it on a shelf or something. This is a cool concept, but the software is where it lets you down... hard.Setup was ridiculously easy, in fact, suspiciously easy. Download the app, turn on the camera, app displays a QR code on your smartphone and you place it in front of the camera, connect it to your WiFi, and it does the rest. Negative to this is you must have an internet connection to access it (even when your smartphone is on the same WiFi) and you can't use it in any third party DVR solutions. You are stuck using their app. And while the apps user interface is ok, it is not at all reliable.",2,1,2017-12-7,1,8,0
"I bought two of these cameras, one for my front door and one for my living room and kitchen area to monitor my pets while I’m away and for my own price of mind and safety when I’m home alone. I also purchased a 32gb memory card for each, which was totally worth the extra dollars. I have had the memory cards in my devices for a month and have yet to need to clear my storage from my memory card. If you only want motion detection, you can set the alert settings to notify you. It records 15 seconds and then notifies you. The timing has never been off and it doesn’t take minutes or hours to receive the notification - always about 15 seconds. Lastly, I did see someone say there is no way to change the sensitivity, which is incorrect. You can set it to be sensitive from 1% to 100%. My front door is set to 50% so it doesn’t pick up tree movement or plant movement. However, if a cat walks past my door or someone walks into the sight of the camera, it does notify me, so I’m not getting unnecessary amounts of notifications.I’d review this product with four main traits that I love about it. First, the quality is phenomenal. For $25 you get an easy to setup product that you can truly tell is quality when you take out of the box. I just wanted a camera that would alert me when there was movement, not so much to go back for old footage, but it’s great for both. The footage is in 1080p and it’s really great (one of the main reasons I bought this camera over the other one I was contemplating). Second, it’s highly efficient and easy to use. The installation process took me less than 1 minute each. All you need to setup is WiFi, have the camera plugged into an electrical outlet and the Wyze app downloaded on your phone. It was fun and exciting to setup this camera (small things excite me!). I’ve never had a problem with this camera not being exactly what I wanted. It’s easy to move around and comes with a 3M magnet which allows you to place on a wall if you don’t have a magnetic surface (which I didn’t). Third, the reliability of this product has truly blown me away. I saw reviews and comments about the reliability and was a little worried, but it had all the features I was looking for. I don’t really want it to be a security system like some people are trying to accomplish, I just needed something to give me price of mind when I wanted to check in on my pets and notify me of movement, which this accomplished very well. Having mentioned security system, there is a setting to detect smoke alarms, which I have set for safety reasons (I mean, why not?). In terms of reliability, I have had an instance where my app wasn’t connecting to my camera while I was away from home, but I was able to quickly and easily reset the camera remotely within my app and it was back up within minutes. Also, I’ve been kicked out of the app twice, but that’s hardly anything to concern yourself with. Lastly, this camera is so subtle. Most people don’t even notice it because it’s so small, I’m easily able to hide the wires in my curtains and it even looks very modern. The camera I have facing my porch is undetectable from the porch, but I have a great view of my front door and no one even knows it’s there. I highly suggest this product for anyone looking for an easy to use, quality product that is reliable and efficient!! I’ve already recommended my family and friends and will definitely purchase more of these when I have my own home.",5,1,2018-9-25,1,1,1
Review of WyzeCam v2Form Factor:,3,1,2019-1-6,1,1,1
"If you are out of town and change time zones, the next time you log in, the app asks if you want to sync your time stamp. I thought this was cool, so I did it.But if your time zone is Eastern and your camera has recorded from noon to 1pm, then you log in from Central time zone and it just turned noon there, when you sync, it just backs up the time and starts recording with a time stamp of noon again, overwriting anything else that was previously labeled as 12-1. So your camera will skip an hour. From an Eastern time zone point of view, you will have footage from 11:59:59 and then footage from 1:00:00, with everything else deleted.",1,1,2018-8-8,1,3,0
"Huge disappointment, I guess you really do get what you pay for. Cheap price for a reason. I read a few bad reviews which said they had to power cycle the cam every 1 to 2 days, but thought they just were unlucky and got defective cams. Well, mine was worse and I had to power cycle every 1 to 2 hours. I would try to connect and the majority of the time I would get an error message saying that it needed a power cycle. As a last resort, I even set it to the lowest resolution but that didn't help. Note it always had a very strong wifi signal so that was not the issue. I ordered 2, but didn't bother opening the 2nd after the flaky performance of the 1st. Have already returned both for a full refund after just a few days.",1,1,2018-11-23,1,2,0
"UPDATE:  It stopped connecting to WiFi.  I emailed Wyze describing the problems and they basically said, ""What do you want us to do about it?  Fortunately it was still in the return window, so I did.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!--------",1,1,2019-7-8,1,2,0
"WOW! Super impressed! We have bought several ""security cameras"" over the years and they all have been super difficult to set up- usually ending with me having to call tech support while some yahoo remotes into my PC ( which I do not like) to set the cameras up for me. It was ALWAYS such a pain. Recently my Mom bought a Nest cam - that was pretty easy to set up- but I needed something inexpensive. I heard about this on my local news channel from the tech guy - while he said it was only $20.00 I paid $30.00 and would pay it again! Seriously, this was the fastest, easiest set up EVER! I think it took me all of, maybe 3 minutes, if that!Thank you WyzeCam people for making this so simple. While it doesn't pan & tilt, this gives me a very large range to look at- I was surprised at the amount of space it covered- I can hear, talk through to, night vision- all that I need. In this little tiny cube! LOVE IT!!!!!",5,1,2017-11-27,1,2,0
"Like but there are two major drawbacks: 1. Very unstable firmwares. We bought  4 camera around summer and they updated firmware many time with unstable releases. You must turn on/off manually or DOWNGRADE firmware via special method they provide to fix connection issues 2. Even if you turn off, some how it keeps recording without any notification. 3. Free Cloud recoding almost useless. It only records 15 seconds footage once  in 5 minute which means you left door and 1 minuets later someone breaks door then take camera off line; you will get nothing but lose",1,1,2018-12-8,1,1,0
"It’s a neat toy, but do not rely on this to be your security system.  That was my plan...  It misses lots of motion activity.  Someone literally tried to get into my house yesterday in broad daylight with the camera facing directly at the door. Full glass door, can see clearly right though it.... didn’t record a damn thing.  My wife was home at the time (luckily the people did not get in) so I knew that something should have been recorded.  Nope, nothing.....",1,1,2018-1-25,1,1,0

"I bought this camera back on 11/24/18 because the marketing hype was good. Let me tell you, if you want to be upset and bitter AT LEAST twice a week, this is the camera for you! This thing WILL NOT stay connected. It drops connection so frequently that it's not dependable. I have followed all the troubleshooting steps online, I have reset my router, moved my router, move the camera, bought a new router, change my network name and password... everything. It still drops connection. The app is trash is consistently tells me that the network connection is not stable enough and then the camera goes offline. I'll be sitting in the living room and then I'll here it click and sure enough... the light on the back is yellow, or blinking yellow, or blink blue and yellow... I have spent HOURS resetting up my home network just to make this crappy camera work, but it doesn't. It'll stay online for a few hours and then it's down again. I have even turned off my 5Ghz network so that my 2.4Ghz is the only thing broadcasting and that still didn't help. After reading the support forums and Reddit, I'm okay to say to stay away from this camera. It's cute, it's cheap but it's not worth all the trouble. As I'm typing this, the camera is STILL connecting and disconnecting and I just factory reset it and my new router. I'm done. I promise if you spend your money on this camera, you'll just upset yourself off in the long run. Don't do it. It's not worth the headache.",1,1,2019-3-28,1,9,0
"I got the camera on Aug 27, installed it and was working, not perfectly but working and the audio was not clear but it was not a big deal to me. Until on Oct 24, after barely 2 months of using it, the camera stopped recording.  The worst, it has only a 30 days warranty and I could no longer return the item.

"Not quite sure what rating to give this, as results spanned a wide range. I got three (one swiveling and two stationary). The first connected easily and quickly. It has been working well since. Neither of the other two would connect. Tech Support was no help so Amazon replaced them.After several attempts the swiveling model connected, but has only been sorta kinda working ever since. The third has still been unable to connect at all. This would probably work out to 2.5 stars, but Tech Support has been truly wretched, hence 2 stars (they offered only obvious and simplistic suggestions, then stopped responding altogether).",2,1,2018-9-26,1,9,0
"Originally loved these three camera that I purchased in April.  Then one stopped working and nothing I did would get them up and running again.

I have called everyday for a week and you get a message, ""sorry, no one is available to help right now, call back another time......disconnected!!! Then I sent three email requests....crickets. So after three weeks Imtried to use the square trade insurance I purchased. Can't use that, still under mfg. warranty that is 1 year.

"First off I have the v1 camera and I still have no issues. This camera basically seems to have broken from the last firmware update. Since the update it just keeps cycling to connect to wifi. In the app I get a error 27 code. I contacted their customer service but got no response until I sent a follow-up email three days after the first contact. Their ""solution"" didn't work and the descriptions on the steps were incorrect too. Now i have a camera that doesn't work. Hoping they can fix this or replace it.

so at first i was great until just a little past the date to exchange or return... Its having connections issues and i would have to unplug and replug and sometime it would connect but only to get disconnected or unable to connect message... and video is not being recorded even after checking the card or notifications... I know the price is very cheap and they say you get what you paid for but if this issue was to be fixed it would really be an awesome camera compared to the other cams that cost 10x the amount.

"The camera started off very well with quality. After 3 weeks ,the picture would be black and white randomly and it would pick up us leaving the house but 15 minutes later wouldn't pick us up returning. I contacted customer service only to receive a generic foreign company auto reply of we'll respond in 2-5 business days ,well it was longer than that for a reply. I have to restart the device almost daily for it to work right and have finally given up . I am returning it and suggest not purchasing to the poor customer service and bugs. Companies want your money at purchase but then want time to reply to issues,maybe I should have said send me the camera and I'll send the payment in 2-5 business days or when I get around to it.

"UPDATE: there is a way to manually flash the new or old firmware, which fixes the error. While it is a bit annoying, it is not hard. Also it has been a long time since I have had to manually flash them to fix the error, so maybe I won't ever have to again... I would buy again despite this issue.I bought 2. Soon after receiving them a notice appeared that there was a firmware update, asking if I wanted to apply it. Naturally I applied it. One updated with no issues, the other failed and would no longer connect (code -90). I sent for a replacement feom amazon since it was still within the time I could do that. the new one updated fine. Fast forward 2 months and there's another update. I am hesitant to update but then decide the previous time was a random occurrence and decide to update. The same one works and is updated, but the other one (the new one) fails! Now I am outside the Amazon return window and am waiting for wyzecam to get back to me. There is a fix, see the update above.",4,1,2018-4-27,1,1,0
"A lot of misinformation out there on this product. This is a clone of Xiaomi hardware that is purchased and rebranded under three brands, including Wyze and iSmartAlarm (Wyze is less expensive and has better software and service). The Wyze rebrand is very much worth it, as they add much better software and service on top of the generic hardware.

For a $20 device someone might consider my expectations high.But I consider them most basic.(1) WiFi range of this device is very poor. I can not go more than 15-20 feet with any router. I have tried Netgear R7800 X4S and some older routers. primarily this seems to stem from a poor antenna design as I can see the signal fades away pretty fast as I move the camera further. At 20 ft the camera can't keep it's connection.,1,1,2018-1-15,1,7,0

After reading many professional and end user reviews over Wyze, I decided that these cams were a great investment. If they didn't work, I'd simply send them back since my Withings Home still worked. Luckily, so far, no issues.I originally purchased my former Withings Home camera as a way to watch my son sleep in his crib. The unit failed twice while I owned it along with a slew of connectivity issues early on - as well as it constantly asking me to set it up again. The failed camera ended up being the power supply each time, including the setup issues.

"The Wyze-cam has some nice features to it such as motion and/or sound sensor which will record a 12 second clip of the event and optionally send you a notification, the ability to hang the camera upside down and flip the view 180 degrees is a nice bonus for the magnetic base. This camera is discreet and light and can be powered by being plugged into the wall or something like a portable power bank. Good quality image and audio and a two way mic. Also you can download a cool app for android or Apple and view and control the Wyze-cam remotely while you're at work or shopping and stuff.Now all that being said I have found some very inconvenient issues with the camera. Not always will you get a reliable push notification. The motion/sound sensor recording clips will sometimes fail as in the video will simply not have saved. Those missing clips can be crucial. Also you will Need a micro SD card to have it recording non stop and max space for that is 3gb which may get you roughly 3 days of playback on 1080p which is decent but just be aware. Without a micro SD card you can only auto record events that are triggered by the the motion and/or sound sensor. So for example, if someone broke in your home while you were gone you would only have a 12 second clip of that event in this scenario. Unless you were quick to react to the push notification (if you even get one) then you will be able to record limitless onto your phone or whatever your using.",2,1,2017-12-25,1,3,0

Google ""wyze can playback not working"" and you'll see that many customers have reported the playback function stopped working after recent updates, so though you'll get incessant notifications no matter how much you reduce camera sensitivity, you won't be able to see what happened for more than initial 12 seconds because camera playback doesn't work. More infuriating is Wyze Cam blaming corrupted or defective memory cards when customers are clear the Playback dropped as soon as they updated firmware. If the update ruined the SD cards, then wyze cam needs to replace those cards. Either way, wyze cam seems to have ruined functionality of cameras and now they don't answer the phone or address the problem.

The problem is alert thumbnails and videos mysteriously reappear on your phone a few weeks later by the hundreds.  One day you will have nothing in your picture/video gallery on your phone and the next there will be hundreds that you deleted weeks ago.  I have to wonder how secure their system is when things that have been deleted come back to haunt you weeks later?I spoke to tech support a few weeks ago and followed their suggestions.  They said they thought this issue had been fixed.  That was at least 3 weeks ago.  I got hundreds of deleted notifications back today.

"I have two WYZE cameras, one that pivots/tilts and one fixed type.  Both work great and were easy to set up with my Samsung Galaxy J7 Sky Pro phone.  My only criticism is that the motion alert recording time is only 12 seconds.  (This is true even if you select motion tracking on the pivoting version.  The camera will continue to track motion after 12 seconds but not record any more than 12 seconds, not sure what the point of tracking is if it is not recording.)  I would be willing to pay a small monthly fee to increase recording time if this was offered.  I know that when you get an alert you can bring up the app and start recording manually but you may not be able to respond to every alert generated and there is often a delay before you even get an alert.  What makes it worse is that once you get a 12 second recorded alert the camera will not accept another motion alert for a period of time (I measured this time as 6 minutes).  So if your cat causes an alert and a burglar breaks in a minute later, steals your TV and leaves within 5 minutes, you will have a 12 second record of the cat but never see the burglar.  If the ""dead time"" between alerts was reduced and alert record time increased it would be a much better system.",4,1,2018-12-11,1,7,0

"Considering the cost, this is the one of the best cameras on the market. I have been searching for a security solution and I think Wyze will end up being a large part of it. Until they come out with an outdoor camera I will have to continue to supplement with my other camera brands.As an indoor camera these have everything a home owner needs (quality,simplicity,size,price). The app is also very good. It is faster and more user friendly than my other apps (Zmodo Zsight, Meshare, Reolink). I recently installed one of these cameras outside under an eave to keep it mostly protected from the weather. So far so good, but the focal length is not optimal for outdoor and medium to long range distances. I have 2 outdoor zmodo cameras and even at 720p they work better for that application. Inside 20 feet is where I would personally want to have this camera. However, its nice to see something over nothing, and I will likely hold out for Wyzes outdoor camera before purchasing another brand, unless a great deal were to present itself.",5,1,2019-6-28,1,6,0
"So I’ve had this Wyze Cam for about a day now, and I’m quite liking it so far. I have a few things I want to point out and compare. I own two Canary Home security cameras and I can say the Wyze Cam overall is a phenomenal value, it’s got pretty much all the features of the Canary but at fractions of the price, so here’s a few things it’s currently missing; For starters the video capture for motion alerts is about 12 seconds long which isn’t a deal breaker but I’ve heard they may improve on this in the future, it only supports 2.4 GHZ Wi-Fi (for me this isn’t an issue since my WiFi is pretty fast and I don’t have any connection issues, You have to (at this time) manually activate and deactivate the motion alerts as there’s no geofencing so the camera doesn’t know when you’ve left the house, there is also about a 30 second delay when motion is detected tans the motion is recorded but this may vary from time to time, video is capped at 10 frames a second put still looks quite smooth for a cheap camera like this one, and lastly the speaker isn’t that great, so it may seem like there are many negatives but these are all very minor issues that can be fixed and enhanced for the future. For what your getting which is; 14 day video recording, varied notifications, 1080p video, night vision, SD, card reader and overall flexibility this camera is a steal and worth every penny. If you know what your getting into and are aware of the minor imperfections this camera is great and has even surpassed the majority of my expectations. I will update this review if needed.",5,1,2018-2-6,1,9,0
"Second Review: BURNT UP IN SMOKE.  My first camera just clicked... so I bought a second one. It worked fine for a few months, but I wanted to extend my recording time, so I bought a high quality SD card from Sandisk. Last night I woke at 2am to the smell of electrical fire, and found my camera and card smoldering.  I quickly unplugged them and made contact with Amazon today, who in turn contacted Wyze (an Amazon company).  They were concerned and empathetic and are replacing both products and asked me to return the damaged items “to ensure this won’t ever happen again”... I was surprised to see however that other people have had the same issues dating back months - so it seems to me they have a larger manufacturing issue at hand.  My guess is only a fraction of users actually use the camera with an SD card, so the problems only present if the product is defective and if an SD card is in use.  That said, they should be able to determine root cause, as well as manufacturing batches based on serial numbers and should be issuing a recall to those potentially affected units in my opinion. So... for that reason, I’m leaving this at 1 stars.First Review: Product setup fine then started clicking constantly throughout the night and was no longer accessible through app. Tried to reboot, hard reset, etc. Tried contacting customer support but you can only reach them via email - and their automated response says it takes them 5-7 business days to get a first response. Unacceptable customer support.",1,1,2019-2-19,1,7,1

For the most part, I've been very pleased (and impressed!)The good: The price point is perfect! These days it's actually cheaper to have a wifi camera (with much better quality) than a baby monitor which is just crazy to me. The Wyze Cam feels solid, has legs that ""pop"" out of the bottom (and allow you to pivot the camera to get an upwards/downward angle, as needed) and allows you the ability to add a memory card to enable continuous recording.",4,1,2018-10-26,1,8,1

"I have purchased multiple Wyze cameras. The original, two versions 2s, and a Pan and Scan. I have been extremely happy with all of them. Over Christmas I received one as a gift. I set it up, as I had for all of the others that I owned. This one immediately started giving me problems with connecting to my WiFi. I was eventually able to get it to connect, but it would constantly disconnect, and need to be power cycled, even though the WiFi strength was ""Very Strong"" according to the camera. I started my conversation with the Wyze customer service back in December. They have had me jumping through hoops for the past two months, having me run WiFi strength scans, changing the video quality, disconnecting, reconnecting, everything. And still, nothing. Now they just haven't responded in the past two weeks. If this weren't a gift, I just would have returned it to Amazon, which I believe is what Wyze wants, to have Amazon deal with it.

Wyze offers many of the same services for free, plus more. There are a few bugs in the app like the volume muting when you talk and the app not staying awake while viewing video, but they have said these will be addressed. I also do not like that I have to manually turn notifications on and off, for all 3 cameras. Hopefully they can address that some way as well.

The Wyze Cam has, thus far, beat them all and is my current favorite!  I have the $230 Nest Cam that I use to watch the interior living area of my home...  While the Nest cam has a great picture, the Wyze Cam is arguably BETTER!  When compared side-by-side, the Wyze Cam is not only clearer and sharper (admittedly by a slim margin), it's more reliable and provides faster frame-rates.  My Nest Cam is a great camera, don't get me wrong, but it disconnects often and the video is very often choppy.  When I compare the two, I have to honestly say that my Wyze Cam has far les lag, better frame-rates, and remains connected far more consistently.

Then after my first I bought a second, and I will probably be getting another.I live in and apartment so I have it on the inside of the window looking out, so I can't give a night vision review.  But I can see headlights and other lights.  It was the daytime activity I was looking for also.  Additionally I don't use the motion detector because there is a flapping flag outside.  But I love, love, love this. Also a neighbor called the police when they noticed this.  The police came and checked it all and he said he thought they were a great idea and might get some for his house!  LOL!

The new ones recognized the memory cards.These cameras have a wide angle lens that covers a lot of territory and have good resolution. However, since I have DSL internet I often have to use the lowest resolution (360p), otherwise I get an error message that the network is unstable.

"I left a long review on wirecutter about being frustrated that they did not mention this camera before. I have spent over $1500 on Arlo products and I swore to never pay $50 for another battery again. That $1500 got me say, on average, 10 cameras, as well as having to pay $150 per year for the Arlo service. For that price I could have 37 WyzeCam v2's! I hate that I spent so much money on a different system, and really want to sell what I have and switch everything over to Wyze. If you are looking at Arlo, Logitech Circle, Nest, etc., just try this one first. I promise it will satisfy most of your use-cases. Just remember to add a $20 micro SD card to it so that you can save and review recordings. The camera with the SD card is truly a great deal and allows me to record video, review it on my phone, and get notifications. all for a great price! Still mad at what the other companies charge and mad I didn't see this sooner!",5,1,2018-8-17,1,4,0
"I wanted a WiFi enabled camera for my infant's bedroom so I began looking. I quickly ruled out the WiFi baby monitors, they were expensive and none of them had great reviews. So I started looking at Nest and Amazon's cloud based cameras. These looked much better and I almost went with one of them, but in the related items a little $25 camera by Wyze kept popping up. I finally clicked on the Wyze Cam to try and rule it out, but I couldn't. It had everything I was looking for.I originally wrote it off because it was so cheap, however the built quality was good and the magnetic base is a clever design feature. Image quality is very good. I use them on the SD quality setting because on a phone screen its hard to tell the difference between SD and HD. The SD works better if your cell coverage is spotty. Night vision is also very good. The app is very easy to figure out. I like how you can change all the settings including rebooting and updating firmware right from the app. You never have to mess with the camera once its where you want it. Speaking of firmware, the updates have actually fixed some of the bugs I have noticed. Early on the detection settings were either too sensitive or non-existent despite my tweaking in the app. Notifications on my Android phone were also a bit delayed but  firmware updates cleared both issues up. I've been very happy with the camera. Many of the negative reviews I've seen revolve around the video footage being sent through servers outside the U.S., I might be in the minority, but I don't care. If someone in China wants to see how a very boring American family lives then go ahead.  And I think it is EXTREMELY unlikely that there is anyone watching or some sort of A.I. gleaning information off Wyze camera feeds. To some it up, extremely pleased with the camera and app, don't care about Wyze using foreign servers.",5,1,2019-8-13,1,2,0
"Okay, I had to hop on my computer to do this review, no way I was going to type all of this on my phone. So, let's begin by saying if I can give this rating no stars or maybe even negative stars I would, the boxes are more high quality than the product itself and here it is the date I received it on my door step (10/11/19) I am sending it back and writing a review on it. Let me tell you why. I am looking for some cameras to put in my apartment unit because me and the wife have noticed things being out of place when coming home from work, so you know us loyal amazon shoppers that's the first place I visited. So, I came on here and stumbled upon this product and seen the questionably, concerning, mysteriously high amount of stars so I proceed to dig into why they have such good reviews. I read a lot of reviews and by a lot I mean maybe close to an hour worth of reviews and even the more lengthier reviews because if you're anything like me you really care about what you buy, where your money is going and how quality the product you are spending the money is. I read the good and the bad, and with the bad I wish I would have listened. Those bad reviews are what you will get IF you are very faithful like I was with this product. It is indeed true that the camera never has connection and what I really like about this is that the app tries to make it seem like it's your phone or your internet that's having the problem but it's not and I know it's not because I have 5G WiFi in my apartment and it works fantastic. How did I know it was working at the time of the camera not working? Because I went to youtube on my phone and watched an ad and the video I had on with no buffering included. Then in order to get the camera back to being connected to watch the feed, you have to power cycle the darn thing and hope and bet that it works then and we shouldn't have to do that. And if you don't have connection then you can't see the live feed obviously and the camera is not recording, so you get no recordings of what's going on in your area. So, I stepped out on a huge leap of faith because of a lot of reasons, however the main ones are maybe those people had bad experiences because they were reviews a bit earlier than me buying them, WYZE made a youtube update video on them doing a huge innovation in improving the product, which I like how the problem they stated customers were having complaints on was that customers were having too many complaints and didn't point out the issues about the camera not staying connected. Like I get it. It's 20 something bucks and that's what WYZE is sticking to. But I am a person of quality I am willing to pay extra for quality and RELIABILITY and that is not what WYZE has. So, please do yourself another favor as I'm sure you did at the least once in your lifetime and do not purchase this product. Do not be hard-headed like the ones that gave a chance for it to be messed up in high disappointment!",1,1,2019-10-11,1,4,0
"Everything should be prefaced with a ""okay for the price"" warning. That said...I'm in the ""internet business"" and have a corresponding wired and wireless network here.",3,1,2019-3-21,1,5,1
"TLDR - If you get a bad camera just return it immediately. DO NOT attempt to work through their technical support as they will just give you the run around.The camera seemed to have good picture quality when it worked. However, it kept losing connection and giving me errors. I contact customer support and exchanged a few emails on what to do to troubleshoot. I'm an engineer and never typically need to contact technical support. Most of what they had said to do, I already did (hard reset, delete the app and reinstall, reboot my router, change router configurations, remove SD, etc., etc.). I even went as far as to buy a new router even though it is the only device that has issues on my network. It was clear to me there was an issue that could not be resolved and likely a hardware problem.",1,1,2019-2-1,1,5,0
"Despite the qualified reviews, I decided to try this camera and be one of the people who had luck with it and (hopefully) I'd leave a great review.Unfortunately, I've spent 45 minutes in the setup process, and it's failed at almost every step.  Sometimes inconsistently and bizarrely.",1,1,2018-2-23,1,1,0
"High Def, definitely! This has much better picture quality than I expected for the price. The firmware and app has way more features than expected, and keeps getting improved and enhanced. I have many now, and will likely get another handful, before politics increases import prices...I almost punched 4 starts for Night vision, the built in LEDs are great for indoors but not real bold for outdoors at a distance. Get an IR flood or spot if you need to do a long driveway or deep yard. If it's 6 feet or so, you're good. So many folks on FB groups have bought many of these. They are small light great utility and cheap! I ended up buying WIFI repeaters to improve stability but having done so they have settled into their intended purposes, like one on my front door to capture packages being delivered, and hopefully discourage those that might seek to snatch them! They keep an eye on my shed, garage, trailer, doors and more. Some will be placed on my travel trailer for the views.",5,1,2019-5-7,1,2,0
"This thing is not the highest quality camera you have ever gotten, but man does it follow through for the $30 you pay for it.  If you want to keep constant recording, or backlog video, you'll need an SD card (recommended 32gb), but that still keeps the total price tag under $40.Things it does well: sends alerts when motion triggers, 24/7 access to live footage from phone app, connects to wifi with no problems, and is way more discrete than you may initially give it credit for.",5,1,2019-5-10,1,3,0

"I picked WYZE during a recent lightning deal.  The price was great, however, I am disappointed with the overall experience.  Let's break down why:Pros:",1,1,2019-12-19,1,3,0
"I initially liked this product until I learned its limitations the hard way.  I was home sick one day when I heard someone in my house.  Apparently my landlord was just ""making sure everything was ok"" when he thought I would be at work.  I ordered these cameras the same day.  Well, they did catch my landlord in my house again. but I have no idea how long he was in the house or what he was doing while he was in there!  Each camera recorded only one 12 second clip when he was initially detected by the motion sensors.  No recordings from any of the cameras after the single 12 second clip that showed him walking into each room!  Needless to say, I moved out.  When I set these cameras up in my new place, they would no longer record anything using the sound detection and only a few events using the motion.  Within days, they started quitting and showed an error code in the app.  I contacted Wyze and tried their suggestions with no success.Ultimately, even when these were working right they recorded so few events as to be essentially worthless.  I wish I could get my money back (Wyze won't refund me and it's barely past Amazon's 90 day return period).  I'm going to suck it up and buy the Arlo, which is more expensive but infinitely better quality than these junk cameras.",1,1,2019-4-11,1,4,0
"I've had three Wyze camera's for almost a year now. They are great for the price, but recently have run into issues with them always getting disconnected. I have to repower them once a week. It's a flaw the tech support has no fix for other than to 'restart the camera's, or 'reinstall the software.' I did all that, but they still go out regularly.I've also had issues getting any of the accessories (like Wyze sense) to connect and work. I've had to return two Wyze sense accessories back. And after a month of returning, I'm still asking  where my refund is as it's still processing.",1,1,2020-8-21,1,3,0
"I purchased this camera to monitor my front yard through the window because I wanted to avoid difficulties of installation and wiring of an outdoor camera. However, I found that this camera has too many problems. I am thinking about returning it and buying something better. Please read pros and cons below.Pros:  1. Decent video quality. But these days all HD cameras have good video quality.",2,1,2019-9-11,1,3,0
"I have dlink, blink, and yi systems. Wyze is the fraction of their price and does the same job if not better. I set it up inside looking through a window to outside and it captures motion and people very accurately. What I love is the continous playback through a 32gb SD card that I bought separately and installed. You can go to a time stamp and see what happened. I thought I did not get a package once because there was no notification, but checked the delivery time on the UPS system and went to that time stamp, voila, the UPS guy was walking in, it just didn't send me a notification because the UPS guy came 30 seconds after another person passing by and my cool down settings prevented it to register as a new moment. Overall, I highly recommend it. I might get another one for the side windows. You should also get a 32gb micro sd card. They are also quite cheap. I got the Samsung one.",5,1,2019-8-16,1,4,0
"OK, this is an unpaid shill-free review by someone delighted by these little sugarcube cams.Why?  They just work, there is 5% of the setup BS compared to other cams, and Wyze clearly sweated the details.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,2,0
It works and does what I want it to do. My issues with it are the 12 second playback looks good until movement. I walked past it to record to view quality. On HD I was ghostly. You could see me and clearly until I paused it. Every freeze frame was translucent of body.Next up I had to set sensitivity to max and there is about a 30 second delay before my cell gets alert.,3,1,2020-7-27,1,3,0
"Well the setup appears pretty easy (all voice automated etc.), but it took about five tries for it to connect with my WiFI. After it finally connected, I fianlly got a picture that was petty good, though  it was a bit cludgy (it would freeze every once in awhile...), but I thought it was just growing pains and decided to give it some more time.  Then in about 5 minutes, the related Android phone app was telling me that the software needed updating. Again, this update took about three takes to actually work and have the camera up and running (again, still the cludginess, but I figured it was at least working, so I turned off the app and went on with dinner).  When I tried opening the app again that evening to see how the night vision worked, again it took about three times for the camera to connect and show me the night vision shot.  Annoying, but it was working, so OK.Now the next day at work, I tried connecting....5 times I tried, but I keep getting a ""no connection"" error. It's also  telling me to reset the camera (well, how can I do that while I'm at the office?).  All these issues made me decide to reurn the camera.  I really wanted to like it, but it was just too undependable.  Amazon, as usual was great with the return.",2,1,2019-10-4,1,2,0
"Hace tiempo necesitaba adquirir una cámara de seguridad para mi casa, por varios meses estuve buscando y leyendo los comentarios de varias cámaras, entre esas, encontré WYZE.Me sorprendió el precio y pensé que era de muy mala calidad, pero al leer tantos comentarios positivos decidí comprarla.",5,1,2019-7-5,1,5,1

This camera is acceptable for $25 but I will buy something else.There are many drawbacks,2,1,2019-9-14,1,3,0
"It's easy to assume the motion detection and sound will work without the internet connection.  They don't. I didn't find out until I went to download their app. I re-read the ad and sure enough, tucked into the description in an offhand manner (like it's not important!) there it was.  Not sure I understand the programming difference between their ""cloud"" and a hardwired microSD card, but those functions do not work without internet, so using this on a large property is cost prohibitive, which was the only reason I picked this camera; In other words, if it's not hooked to the internet it's just a video camera.  Gee, will the ""night vision"" work without the internet?  I don't imagine the ""timestamp"" will work, either. Guess I'll just have to put a clock in the frame and hope it will be legible. What a ripoff. Need a large-print statement on the ad: NO FUNCTIONS WORK EXCEPT MANUAL RECORDING WITHOUT AN INTERNET CONNECTION.Update: It just keeps getting better! Forget using this with your laptop (or any real computer, for that matter)!!!  It's only compatible with iOS and Android... YOU CAN'T EVEN USE THAT OVERPRICED KINDLE FIRE YOU BOUGHT! So, they want you to control this thing WITH YOUR PHONE?!?",1,1,2020-3-24,1,3,0

"First of all, I don't use Google or Alexa or the cloud. Mine is connected to the hotspot on my phone, which is not great wifi, but it works. I use the SD card and stream to my phone. I use it as a nanny Cam for my elderly mother, and it does an excellent job. Alerts never fail. Sound not great, can't really say how well the 2way communication works as my mom can't hear much. But I talk to her dog all the time and she hears me. Doesn't talk back tho 😅  I don't alert to motion anymore, the dogs keep it pretty active,but you can set it monitor only a specific zone  which is great, but her dog still sets it off too much. Video not spectacular, but is clear and sufficient. Runs on nightvision mostly. Better picture than what you see in store security cam videos.Some set up notes. Set up is easy, but wifi connection name must be entered exactly. Case sensitive . And be aware, a wifi connection is a must have. Just use SD card to bypass cloud uploads if you want. Also, restart phone after app installation. Will save a lot of headaches. I put the app on two phones, an old one and an very current model old one needs restarted frequently just to work anyway, and the wyze app ran great on it. The new phone had issues with connection and staying connected till I restarted. Not a glitch since. Camera connects easily. Reconnects without issue when I leave, thereby removing the hotspot, and then return.  Camera and app are way better than I ever expected. I ordered from Amazon and paid more just to make returning easier. If you're looking for state of the art security, spend more. But for just keeping an eye on things, the buck stops here.",5,1,2019-8-8,1,3,0
"Update: new firmware seems to have improved the person AI even with cam on its side. The app has also been updated and a glitch I found was cheerfully figured out by customer support via their Facebook community. The app itself does have a vertical viewing option but when it goes to full screen, the normally landscape view becomes a welcome portrait view for my side mounted cam. I also made a matte black paper covering and backdrop for the cam which pretty much eliminates reflections from the window glass.  With illumination from the overhead sensor light at night, the night vision mode works very well without the need for the IR lights. In HD video quality is excellent. In SD it’s fine for phone screen viewing but less desirable for larger screens. I pretty much use HD all the time without any bandwidth issues. I’ve also been able select a smaller detection to just pick up motion from the edge of the walkway to the front door that has helped cut down on random motion notifications. I also have one in my living room over looking the back patio in its normal landscape orientation and it definitely does a better job of using the AI to detect people. Far more hits, very few misses and almost no false positives. Feisty, the wyze forums and Facebook group have been a great resource and place to post ideas for new features or discuss new product ideas.Original:",4,1,2019-9-22,1,2,0
"The camera code is specifically coded not to allow connecting to WiFi networks without a password. If you live in the middle of nowhere with no password on your WiFi  you can not use this camera.If you plan on using this on a captive sign on network, like to watch your hotel room, you can not use this camera.",1,1,2019-3-2,1,6,0
"I chose this one because there are no membership and ongoing service fees required. Arrived today.  So far, so good.  Setup was very simple except that it asks for a confirmation number and then begins a sixty second countdown, so have your email app open before you sign up or you'll have to recycle the code.  You will have to sign up for the app with an email address and choose a complex password (Caps and lower case, number AND symbol.)  So if you want alerts in real time, use an email address that you get alerts from on your phone. Other than that the entire setup probably took less than a minute.  Picture quality can be set to SD or HD.  SD is supposed to be poorer quality in exchange for faster speed but I found the quality to be excellent in SD.  Camera angle is surprisingly wide.  Will set it up in the area to be watched and update review once performance is observed.  UPDATE:  I love this little camera!  Works beautifully.  Can't understand why anyone is concerned about ""privacy"" unless you are videoing things you don't want other people to know about.  If you're using it to watch the front door when who cares if people in China know when your mail arrives?  The magnetic mount base allows you to stick it to a file cabinet or fridge, and it can be tilted and articulated into just about any position.  Only beef I have with it is it will not run on a USB portable battery.  Also seems that it will not run on just ""any old"" USB power outlet.  Apparently it requires the charger it comes with and only that.  Also cannot seem to get a full screen picture out of it without playing with the phone settings.  It likes a WIDE view but in general you want a TALL view.",4,1,2018-5-15,1,4,0
"Man, almost had a great product, but per usual the company went south with software and privacy.Camera picture is great for the price. No complaints there. Easy setup as well. But that's not good enough for these cameras to have any real value or function unless you want a nanny cam to watch a live feed on. These are not going to meet your needs if you are looking for security cameras. 12 second clips and once a clip is recorded it doesn't seem to start recording again for like...another five minutes. So I just watched a guy slowly walk onto my property...I can't tell you what happened after that because he was walking slow enough to not make much distance over the course of the 12 seconds it recorded...and then by the time the camera was able to start recording a second clip, he was gone and there was nothing to record. So...unless you are lucky you really aren't going to get any helpful security footage with this. You can semi get around this limitation by storing to a memory card, which allegedly allows up to 1 min recorded clips, however the two cameras I first purchased did not work with memory cards and soon after I was sent a notice from Wyze stating that they had sold a bunch of defective cameras and I to contact them to get replacements. Wyze only initially offered one replacement even though both of my cameras didnt work with the memory cards. The replacement they sent was also defective...the micro usb recepticle would not accept the micro usb cord...so no way to power it. Awesome! So I emailed them and complained some more and they sent me two replacement cameras, which they should of done in the first place. They only did this after engaging in a nonsensical lengthy email exchange and only when I threatened to negative review them up and down the internet did they get the replacement cameras in the mail. I have yet to switch them with the original defective cameras because frankly I'm pretty tired of anything having to do with Wyze considering the amount of time I've had to put into getting non defective cameras. So thumbs down to Wyze as a company as well. Also, the detection settings are terrible.",2,1,2019-9-7,1,2,0
"These camera's are the highest quality in the price range. Their set up is wicked easy, I added multiples, and them set up in minutes. They are great quality, and a great price. I have over 20 years in the security industry and have been using cameras for all that time. These camera's provide exactly what a home owner needs, without any contracts, wiring, professional installation, and a price easily affordable. There is no middleman, so there is no mark up. Great project, Great Price, Great Deal! I wish I knew of this option years ago, before I dropped a few hundred dollars on a baby monitor camera. This does all of that, (Nigh vision, Sound, Speaker, wireless...) without having to carry the monitor around, or only being limited to go within the distance of the monitor. These camera's run off a cell phone and can be viewed, live, or by motion detection as far as your cell phone can go... Like when your on vacation out of town, you can remotely view and talk through the camera's.",5,1,2018-12-31,1,3,0
"We've bought 16+ of these cameras for my company over the last couple years, so I'm well familiar with using them as security cameras. BUT a few days ago (beginning of April 2020), Wyze released a custom firmware that you can load on an SD card, and flash the software on the camera to turn them into a webcam for remote office work, given the current situation.The process is super easy, but it does require getting a USB-A to USB-A cable (both ends look the same). The microphone quality is iffy, but it's pretty easy to find a mic to plug into your computer. Since it's impossible to get webcams right now, this is the best solution I've come up with for remote working.",5,1,2020-4-4,1,2,0
"While this camera is okay for the money, you will have endless connection problems.  Forget trying to play back anything detected.  I can never get it to connect to get it to play back.  I have a proper 32 card in it so it loops, but you can not connect to the camera to play it back.  Pretty Lame really.When it does detect motion you get a notice, but it only records for 12 seconds, you can not tell it to record longer.  If you want to record longer you have to pay for a monthly subscription.  You can click the notice, and see the 12 second clip, often what ever set the motion off is out of view, then by time person comes into view the 12 seconds is up and you get no recording until a time out period goes by.  Making it worthless as a security camera unless you pay WYZE a heafty monthly subscription fee.",2,1,2020-1-7,1,2,0
"The camera seems excellent value, good built quality and very good specifications. However, Wyze failed to deliver the software part and therefore the whole thing turned out to be marketing of a chinese (Xiaofang/i-smart) camera with an app. Here are some of the biggest problem:- Too many false alarms/notification in any settings.",2,1,2018-2-18,1,4,0
"I have had this camera for over 4 months now and I think it's great.  If you understand what you are buying, you will not be let down.  All of my experiences are purely using the cloud recording, I have not tried a memory card yet.This is a super cheap wifi camera that has a monthly fee for all the good features.  Without the monthly fee the camera will be extremely limited and probably not worth having for anything except the live view and maybe using a memory card?  The app is pretty good and seems to be getting updated regularly.  My phone can quickly connect for live view, or easily look through the last week or two of recordings.  The paid features make it super easy to sort through and find only recordings of ""people"" (ai recognition) instead of watching through all the false triggers.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
"I was very happy with the performance vs the price of this camera. But eventually I get wrong. It records when it wants and sleeps when it feel. Whenever I see at the camera I see the Night vision LEDs are illuminating so I think the camera is on. I very often look at the app. Today, my sons bike is stolen from our porch. I opened the app and found that the camera was sleeping for a long time.See the screenshot of the dates in 2019, it only recorded 16 days in two months (January and February 2019).",1,1,2019-3-2,1,5,1
"I bought this device to watch over our house while away on vacation. We had folks coming to look after our pets and clean the house and I wanted some confirmation that they were onsite as expected. The wide video field was very clear and the motion detection was pretty good. It did get fooled by shadows/reflections from cars moving across the ceiling, but that wasn't a regular occurrence.While on vacation I was able to stream the the video of the notification events and live streams very easily assuming LTE or WiFi.  The night vision capability was very good, providing a well-lit image. I chose to use SD video for streaming. It had excellent clarity and detail. I checked out HD, too, and it is excellent, but wasn't necessary for my needs.",5,1,2018-8-8,1,3,0
"Let me preface this by saying I very rarely give 1 star reviews. I'm very reasonable will just replace a defective product if I end up getting one. So for starters when I received this camera it was packaged in one of amazons cheap shipping bags instead of a box and I think that may have lead to the issue I ended up having (as you shouldn't put delicate machinery in a bag lined with thin bubble wrap). Every time I would try and set up the device instead of going through the set up process it would cut off the machines prerecorded message mid sentence and just made a loud repeated clicking noise instead (imagine morse code). So being a reasonable person I returned it and got a replacement. I figure every company has a bed egg or two. Unfortunately the second one did the same thing! I watched many videos and read many posts about troubleshooting trying to figure it out, but nobody had my exact problem. In the end I just assumed they didn't work because they were poorly put together and when put into those flimsy shipping bags it knocked the parts inside loose as UPS drivers tossed it around and such. Regardless do not buy this product. It may seem like a steal, but it's not worth the hassle of having to return it.",1,1,2019-2-13,1,4,0
"Worked great for a few days. Then I went out of town yesterday, and it stopped working today. It says it needs to be power cycled, but turning it off and on remotely doesn't work. Having it work only when I'm home to fix it is pointless. Unfortunately, I'll be past the return date by the time I get home.UPDATE: They made some updates, and I haven't had a problem with the camera since. Good job, Wyze!",4,1,2018-11-23,1,6,0
"Great idea and I was stoked to get my camera.  In fact, I was ready to put my wired system for sale on Craig’s List.After playing around with the one camera I bought I totally changed my mind.  These cameras have a lot of positive review but I can tell you that unless you are putting the camera in the same room as your router you probably won’t have connectivity.  These things need some sort of antenna to help the issue.  I have the camera sitting right outside my front door with the wireless router only about 10’ away and it won’t connect.  That is pathetic!",2,1,2018-12-17,1,4,1
"This is ONLY good as a nanny/doggy cam. NOT for home surveillance. WHY? The software is very glitchy (it works when it wants to work). Also, there is a 30 second delay from actual motion to phone notification which is RIDICULOUS! This also isn’t a great camera for monitoring thru glass. I placed this in my front livingroom window to monitor action in front of the home. To test it out I walked a lap around my house. Walked past my front door at 5:29:31 and I didn’t get the notification until 5:30!!! That’s a whole 30 seconds! I was already at the rear of my home by the time the notification came thru my phone. That’s way too long for my security needs. Unacceptable! Additionally, The night time video quality is poor. Daytime quality is ok. Sending it back ASAP! The seller should highlight these things before wasting customers time. I didn’t expect greatness from a $25 camera but I did expect for the camera to operate and function as well as the seller’s description said it would.",1,1,2019-9-29,1,3,0
Easy to install.  This is  an amazing camera for such a low price.  Pixels aren't great but considering everything else....I got it to watch my dogs while I'm at work.  Does the job and I think just as well as those $150 cameras out there!  Very happy customer here!,5,1,2018-9-27,1,9,1
"It never connects anymore! It worked for about a week, but it's practically useless at this point. It rarely ever connects, even when I try to restart it. It's been nothing but a source of frustration. Until they figure out how to fix it, I would steer clear away from it. I bought it to play around with it since it was so inexpensive. Don't be tempted at the price. It's not worth it since it never works. Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra for something that connects. I tried to find a solution to it on online forums, but nothing seems to work. Google this model and you'll find a ton of people with the same problem.",1,1,2019-9-27,1,5,0
"The video quality is as good as ring or nest video cams, but I like the software in the wyze cam better. More options and features in the app than the other brands. camera works just as good. I especially like that you do not have to pay a subscription for each camera like ring and nest to record when motion is set up. This automatically uploads to the cloud for 14 days for free. If you are like me, and have a bunch of camera, ring or next is too expensive to subscribe all your cameras for a monthly fee. I also like that you can record to a micro SD card from the app and dont have to only record to the cloud. I would love an outside one that runs on solar, Wyze!",5,1,2019-11-30,1,3,0

"The camera functions ok, but for my needs I have to use Wyze's custom(and unsupported)  RTSP-enabled firmware.  Hopefully someday Wyze will finally produce standard firmware with RTSP built in.  I'd recommend assigning a static IP in your router for these cams, which is particularly useful if you go the RTSP route, where an IP change at every reboot is frustrating.  The circular metal plate that comes with the camera for magnetic mounting could have a better design, because having a screw hole in the center of it means the magnetic camera base will never sit flat and securely with a raised screw head there (an edge mount tab would be better).  And as others have noted, security is a concern, so I only have these setup to access only via isolated LAN via RTSP, and disallow the cameras from having any external traffic capability.",4,1,2020-6-21,1,2,0
"Updated:  My first review of this was 4 stars.  I had to slap it down to 2 because it is not reliable.  It goes through setup fine.  Maybe will connect, vid quality is darn good.  You walk down the hall, pull out your phone and connection is lost.  I'm talking 15' away. I realize the connection is made via the WiFi network.  My point is that it's not like I'm driving into the woods and can't connect.  Literally, within the same office it will stop working.  As for whoever said REBOOT is a solution, it's not.  It may bring it back, but within a few mins, the connection fails again -- and again and again.Here's my initial review:",2,1,2019-6-29,1,3,1
First of all I have to give credit where credit is due.  I have both the Wyze cam and the Wyze pan and zoom cam.  The hardware on these cameras is nothing short of amazing for the price.  I honestly have better reliability performance from these cameras than I do from my Ring which is roughly 10 times the cost plus a cloud subscription.Pros: Cost obviously.  Performance and image quality are amazing.  Ease of setup is downright remarkable.  Alexa integration is simple and works well with Fire TV.  Motion and person detection works very well also.,4,1,2019-7-31,1,2,0
"I decided to give this company a shot because so many loved their cameras and price point. Sorry, but these cameras are not that great and there are SERIOUS issues with them:1. ) I have a camera that I cannot connect to reliably. I'd say 9 times out of 10 I get the error ""Connection failed (error code 0)"" The vendor tried to push this off on a network error or configuration. I'm a network engineer by trade and rest assured I'm not blocking protocols or ports related to this product.",1,1,2019-12-31,1,2,0
"I have used two of these cameras for over 9 months now. The camera provides a decent picture, but it is rare that i can connect to them via the app.  It takes about 4 tries to connect when it works at all, and then will lose the connection shortly thereafter. Both are placed near the wifi source. As a true security source, it fails.",1,1,2018-8-8,1,1,0
"I really tried with this thing.  I consider myself a fairly ""techy"" person.  I build my own computers, I have an IT role where I work, etc. I simply could not get this thing to record to an SD card.  I went through the forums, messaged their IT (which simply sent me to the forums), etc.  Nothing would make this thing record properly...Unless I activated their subscription service.  Then ALL OF A SUDDEN it's recording events properly and I can access them... in the cloud, where I do not have any security over the videos.  People are doing weird workarounds like rolling back the firmware by flashing an SD card with previous versions.  I spent literally hours trying to make this thing work because I wanted to buy a handful of them and put them around our house. Apparently you get what you pay for and I'll just have to upgrade to one of the more premium systems.  Buyer beware.",1,1,2020-4-27,1,5,0
I bought this camera and after a week it updated the firmware and it wont connect to the wifi. the company has not issue a repair for this. so if you are looking to buy this camera go to the WYZE forums website and see if they have resolved this issue before you buy.. currently after a week of use am out 25 dollars. I do have to say that if it was not for the connection problem this would of being a great camera.I would have giving it 5 start but at this time if they do not resolve this issue I just bought a paper waight.,2,1,2018-2-17,1,1,0
"I bought the Wyze cams when Amazon suggested them as a better deal than the Yi cameras. Since Amazon limits Wyze to 3 per customer, I decided to try both brands.I'm still experimenting with both and didn't plan to write a review so early, but I have to say a big concern to the Wyze cam is the inability to turn off the IR light in night mode.  I'm using the cameras facing out windows,  so the light puts a reflection/glare on the glass, ruining the image.  If you don't use night mode you need good outside lighting, or the picture is poor.",3,1,2018-8-23,1,6,0
"So you definitely get what you pay for here. It's a cute camera and the picture/sound quality is really good, but the thing craps out pretty frequently (loses connection, etc). You have to restart it manually to reconnect it, which kind of defeats the purpose of the security camera if I have to be nearby the thing every time it loses connection to physically reset it. Isn't the whole purpose of the thing for me to NOT be near it for it to work? We'll probably just invest in a better quality camera for the ""critical"" location this one is in and move this one to somewhere less critical in the home.So overall: Good picture quality, good sound, nice design. Bad/unreliable connectivity, can't view from PC, can only reconnect manually. Kind of defeats the purpose of itself.",3,1,2018-9-21,1,7,0
"We bought a couple of these early 2019, then got them working, and eventually bought 8 more.

Major Problems:1. Almost takes 3-4 minutes to format memory card.,1,1,2020-4-27,1,4,0
I've had this for almost a year and started having issue a month or so in. I've had back and forth conversations with tech support but eventually they stopped responding even after submitting another ticket when I didn't hear from them for over a month. Just like many others online the camera cannot keep a solid connection to there servers. My router shows it connected with strong signal and can ping the device yet it won't connect to my Iphone app or via the new rtsp reliabiley. Currently I haven't been able to get it to work at all for more then a few seconds if it can connect. I've reinstalled the firmware and did the set multiple times and used a dedicated router for it sitting next to it. Even when it did work there would be several gaps in the continuous recording to the SD card every 10-30 mins. Apparently if it can't connect to there servers it will not record to the SD card even if set to continuous recording. Wtf? That's the point of having an SD card for recording just in case the internet goes out or something. Overall I'm highly dissatisfied and have been trying to get them to replace it under the warranty but since they haven't responded for over 4 months now I may just have to chaulk this up as a massive failure. I wanted to test and replace my current security system with there sense sensors but they require a working camera and I don't feel like going through this again. I have seen many people have amazing results with there cameras and it's probably a quality control issue but the customer service is extremely lacking.,1,1,2019-8-11,1,4,0
"I've used Dlink, Blink, Ring, Foscam and other wifi cameras. None of them are perfect but none are as bad as Wyze.

"I used to like to product until we started hearing a woman’s voice in the camera. Only ones who have the camera installed in the app is my husband and I.  He thought I spoke into it while I was working one day, responded by saying “hey babe” called me and talked about our usual end of the day routine and he mentioned that he heard a voice but guess what?! It wasn’t me. I was with a patient, didn’t have time to check my phone let alone speak into our home camera. It was weird and spooky. I thought he was a little crazy but sort of believed him. I forgot about it until THIS MORNING when I heard a woman speaking into the camera. Here I am home with a toddler and a dog, scared to death. I thought I was losing it. So I went to look and I couldn’t make out what this person was saying. I unplugged the camera- actually both of them. Playroom and kitchen. I don’t recommend this camera because they’re technical issues. Either the government is hacking, some hacker who enjoys watching other people in their homes, or just some malfunction. I don’t want to risk being watch.",2,1,2019-12-16,1,2,0
"Few weeks ago, I purchased a WYZE V2 camera, and last Saturday I received and installed a 32GB SD card specifically designed for cams like WYZE.  I  formatted the card and selected continuous recording  to the SD card.  It worked for 5 days, then I heard some back to back clicking noises from the cam. I tried to watch the contents of the stored video, but could not access it. I looked at the local storage, it showed 0Gb/0Gb.  Tried to reformat it several times. Formatting failed. Removed the card and put it in the adapter, and tried to reformat it, but the SD card could not be accessed by the Windows program.I am not going to put another SD card in it till I get a satisfactory answer from WYZE. I reported the problem few days ago, No responses yet. To me, the WYZE cam with no storage is useless. I chose it because of its local storage  function.",1,1,2019-2-1,1,4,0
"I got my camera, all excited to be able to keep a watchful eye on my brand new foster momma dog and her puppies. I did the initial set-up near the router, figuring I could easily move it to it's final home once we got all squared away.

Look at my dog!It all went downhill from there. If this review was about Wyze Customer Service, they'd get 5 stars. But alas, it is not.",2,1,2020-3-6,1,1,0
"First I will mention the streaming either from the Wyze app itself or through an Alexa device (such as a tablet or Echo Show.)  I have noticed two annoying things:  Sometimes when I go to view the camera I get an error message from the Wyze app that it can't make a connection.  Or if I ask Alexa to view a particular camera it sits at a buffering screen forever and never displays the live video.  I have to close the window and ask Alexa again.  I have found this to happen about 1 out of 5 times trying to view the camera.As for the camera itself, I can't find complaint with it.  It has auto color balance and brightness control which work wonderful...especially if the camera's field of view has a really bright spot in it (like a sunny window or lamp) but the rest of the frame is darker.  Night vision kicks in when it should and the contrast is quite acceptable.  The audio is excellent.  Also, whether it is in night vision mode or normal, it marks motion with various sized green boxes in the frame temporarily just in case you're not being very attentive.",4,1,2020-1-9,1,1,0
I am highly impressed so far with this camera. The bang for the buck is incredible. Only have about a week worth of use but I love it.Picture quality comprares to my more expensive full home surveillance system for which I have 4K cameras on. Obviously comparing 4K to 1080p you do notice the difference if you were to zoom closely on something but the quality is right up there.,5,1,2019-9-17,1,2,1

"I finally caved.  Two events caused me to purchase this camera and then go back and repurchase several more. Within one week my car was broken into (just trashed, nothing taken) and my Target subscription delivery box literally being torn open-BUT they decided not to take it because it was 40 pounds of dog food-not a flat screen they were hoping for-ha!! I live in a wonderfully safe, well patrolled neighborhood, with the police station sitting less than a mile from my home, but that doesn't stop the miscreants from finding their way over. That being said, I'd looked into all the fancyschmancy camera security systems and could not justify the cost. $250 for a doorbell?? $800  for a do-it-yourself 12-piece security system that *I* install??  $150 for an add-on camera  just to look at the backyard?  $30 monthly subscription fee to view the cam videos??? WHATTTT???  Thus began hours of research, reading reviews, watching YT videos, stalking forums until I stumbled into this camera. This bad boy is the real deal and it serves my purposes extremely well.We got this delivered on a Sunday. Had it up and running within 15 minutes, trying it in all different places all over the house and outside. The picture quality is extraordinary. The features are great. I find the app to be very friendly and easy to navigate. What I didn't understand I found answers too. I even chatted with a Wyze  rep asking questions about the 14 day cloud storage verses the sd card. It's not rocket science, but for us non-techy folks, we have questions, ok? :)",5,1,2019-1-8,1,2,0

I’d pay more money for something with much better audio. The speaker on the camera itself it pretty loud and distorted. It gets the job done for me when I need to remind my 8 year old to get in the bed at night lol but if I were to use it for my baby it would probably scare her and she wouldn’t be able to understand me.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,1,0

These are pretty tricky to set up, require using the camera to view an image shown on your cellphone.  At the price, hardly worth returning, so pretty much a loss.

My two ADT cameras are more expensive but they work perfectly and always.",2,1,2018-3-13,1,5,0
"I tried this camera at home before installing them at remote locations for monitoring. While testing in my garage, the firmware improved the camera's connectivity and added person detection.... then after the release of the Wyzecam sensor kit, they added the ability to detect sound as well. These cameras not only record events locally to a microSD card, but also generate a 12-sec video with which the Wyze cloud servers will notify the app on your mobile phone as soon as they can. It is truly amazing what they can do with these little devices... Unfortunately, fast forward to today and now there is seems to be more limited 3rd party channels for acquiring the sensor kits and their newer product lines... and the person detection is again MIA.These are basically my only complaints and that and the lack of remote streaming protocol directly from the camera are my only real complaints. Wyze has recently added the ability to view your cameras by name on FireTV devices and it works reasonably well, even if it is a bit slow to start. Even without this feature, these are still extremely suitable for remote monitoring, especially in a supplemental capacity where you have an alarm and motion sensors. I currently use them in this capacity... as well as in my garage where I can now verify remotely that the garage door is closed or if someone is making noise near my garage. These cameras are sensitive at video and detection, but they do include a means to tune this to your particular needs. Beware of insects at a remote location as if you turn the sensitivity down to stop the notifications, you may also miss motion detection that you desire.",3,1,2020-5-28,1,1,0
"Have wanted a camera that worked with WiFi and was small to monitor who was at the door. When I found this it seemed perfect; and, it is. It uses a micro USB to USB cable to plug into the power cube. It comes with a double sided tape disk and a metal disk to magnetically attach the camera. After downloading the App to my iPhone the setup took less than five minutes. The USB cable was a little too short but micro USB to USB cables come in many lengths and are not expensive.This is the camera mounted to the inside of the window next to the door and this is the image from the camera. Very happy after (EDIT - one year) of operation. The motion detection feature is easy to set up and quite customizable.",5,1,2018-11-29,1,3,1
"Update: They keep sending you an email to review their product, but once you click on one star review it can’t be submitted on their website, so instead I’m posting this on Amazon. Boycott this product!The product is ok for it's pricepoint. I was attracted to this product through YouTube and wanted to give it a try. I also bought a motion sensor through Wyze.com to see if maybe the additional sensor would improve the camera. I had alot of false positives and false negatives with the product.  Little did I know that in order for the sensor to work, I also had to purchase a full starter kit (a bridge, two contact sensors and a motion sensor) so that the motion sensor could be added to the camera (the camera has a built in motion sensor but is poor). When I realized that I needed to buy a $20 starter kit, I decided I wanted to return the $10 motion sensor I just bought or at least see if there was an option to purchase the bridge that I needed. Well, they said that I needed to buy the full starter kit and they don't sell the bridge separately. So basically my budget camera, is now turning into more and more money. I can't return the sensor since I disposed the box last night (my own fault), and now I have a $10 piece of worthless sensor that cannot connect to anything in my house. I have had far better customer service with other companies who were understanding and charged me for items that I needed and never asked me to make extra wasteful purchases. I have tried my best to minimize my own waste footprint and it's frustrating to have to ""recycle"" a brand new product because it can't be used. I did notify wyze customer service I have no need for contact sensors as my whole entire house already has built in alarm sensors, I only bought the motion sensor to add to the wyze cam to see if it can improve motion detection. Customer service was good but customer policies in place are horrible and they need to be reviewed.",1,1,2020-4-3,1,1,0
"I have had 3 Wyze cams for just over 6 months.  They are great for live feed and ok daytime picture/video.  Entirely unreliable cloud services and more than 50% of the time no playback takes place.  It shows events recorded but they simply won't play.  Firmware always kept up-to-date but that seems to be a pointless process.Motion sensors pick up activity but the dead space in the recording cooldown is a terrible feature.  It tends to miss the most important activities taking place.  Night vision isn't awful but it's not great past 10-20ft.  In the end, you get what you pay for and I'll be replacing all 3 of my bargain-basement priced wyze cams with proper and reliable direct-to-disk recording cameras.  The 32GB max SD card size makes them useless if one is away from home more than 2 days at a time.  There is the option of contacting their support dept which I did 2 times in the first 2 months of owning these cameras, both with no response - but it shouldn't be on me to waste my time to make sure their product always works as advertised, that's their job...  The issues I have the cameras for don't take place frequently so I thought I'd give it some time to see if an update would correct the issue, but no such luck.  I'll happily pay 5-10x the price for a system that will always work as promised and always provide a reviewable record of what occurred.

I'd prefer to combine the necessary videos in a program like Adobe Premiere so I have the entire section of video available to view, but this is impossible.The video quality is great.

Unfortunately I received one that doesn't work, after going through Wyze support suggestions and trying more than an hour and over 25 times to connect I now have the hassle of returning the defective item and quality is in question.On working units setup seems simple, you download the Wyze app, plug in the unit, press the SETUP button on the bottom of the unit until a voice prompt says ""Read to connect"".  Your Wyze app will then display a QR code on the screen and you point the camera towards your phone so it can read the QR code to finish setup.  Unfortunately mine just goes into a constant loop of the voice repeating itself like a broken record and it never allows going to the next stage.  Also of concern, another review mentioned that the user agreement states that this company is not responsible if the unit causes a fire.

"This thing is great! Good quality picture and motion sensing. We did not put an SD card into ours, but only bought it to monitor our dog's separation anxiety while we're gone. This thing works great, and for the price, you can't beat it! Two drawbacks for me:1. It sometimes disconnects from our WiFi so I have to take it down and hit the reset button and go through the process of connecting it again (annoying but not a TERRIBLE inconvenience)",4,1,2020-6-25,1,2,0
"I bought this camera because I have an irrational fear that someone will kidnap my dog. This camera allows me to check up on him throughout the day, and it has a feature that triggers a 10 second recording if motion is detected which makes it a perfect security camera for someone who doesn't want to pay for the pricier, full-time recording cameras. It is also extremely easy to set up (both software and hardware speaking), which is great for me because I am terrible with technology and I own no tools. All you have to do is connect it to your wifi like you would a laptop and follow the app prompts on your phone. There is a 3M style sticky tape so all you have to do is peel off the paper and pop it onto the wall. You can even take down the camera easily when you want because the camera is not taped to the wall, it is magnetically attached to a metal circle that is taped on the wall.

"Have had this product since July and am in December now. I have 2 of these cameras. On both of them the SD cards became unrecognizable. The first one it only lasted about a month until the SD stopped working. Was sent an email on how to format the SD card on my computer but never got it to work again. Now it is only useful for recording in 12 second increments. As for the other camera it is in month 5 now and it functions when it wants too. It recognizes the SD card but has no playback option available, so same thing, it only records in 12 second increments AND it loads up on my app when it wants to. I would recommend saving your money and purchasing a better product or purchase at least 2-3 SD cards for backup in case you absolutely need to have it on continuous recording.",2,1,2019-12-9,1,3,0

Without a card, it will only record 12 second videos and you have to wait at least 5-7 minutes for another video to start recording.One thing I do really like is that it works through a window, particularly at night since you can turn off the IR lights, which my (much better) ring stick up camera cannot do. The video quality is decent, but you obviously won't be able to make out any license plates. It's also good for live streaming.

Motion sensor is always going off when the air comes on and moves something or the sun going in and out of clouds. Senses are very on point.

"I will start my review by saying that if your Wyze Cam works right out of the box and never runs into any issues, then it's a great product.  Setup was very simple, and the camera worked well right away.  The next day however is when things went downhill.  Motion detection stopped working entirely.  Only sounds were sending alerts for some reason.  I did my own troubleshooting, made sure it wasn't me who accidentally turned the feature or alerts off, etc. and after some time reached out to their customer support team via chat.  Initially I was happy with the first level of support.  The person I was talking to ran me through the steps I had already tried though, so at this point we had exhausted what could be done at least on my end.  The agent sent a ticket up for further troubleshooting and then I waited.  A week, 2 weeks.  At this point I was annoyed; I had purchased this camera in the hopes that it would be more than just a camera - I needed to receive alerts or it was useless.  I started to search for solutions online in message boards, anywhere I could.  I completely uninstalled the camera and set it up from scratch 2 times.  I did literally anything I could think to do, and I can't tell you the combo of what fixed it but finally motion alerts started to come in again.  Another 2 weeks went by (now we're at a month total) and STILL no one from Wyze reached out to me.  I work in the IT Help Desk field - that kind of thing is pretty unacceptable.  You don't just sit on a ticket for a month with no contact to the end user.  I wrote back yesterday and received a response asking me to send more information on the issue.  Uh, no.  I already did that.  I told them forget it, I figured it out - but now to be honest, I'm going to send the thing back.  If I have an issue that I can't figure out on my own, and it's too late to return it, I can't wait months for someone to get back to me.Outside of that annoyance, when the camera works, it works.  I was happy with the picture quality, I liked the app it worked well and I received alerts fairly quickly though there was a little delay on the camera it wasn't terrible.  Again, if it works, it's a nice product, for what you pay you get a lot of features.  The support aspect is what I was just really unhappy with.",3,1,2019-9-19,1,1,0
I own two v2 cams and one pan.  Initially I thought there were fantastic.  They installed easy and worked great.  Then something happened this year.  The firmware upgrades start becoming a problem.  All of my cams stopped recording alarm events to the locally installed SD card.  Google it and you will see many others that have had the problem and tried many things to resolve it.  Some has success and some not.  It’s obviously a product firmware issue that Wyze apparently has no answer for.  Customers should not have to go through a long hit or miss process in repair a product that should just work.  It not for the free cloud recording then I would have no video at all.  Basically everything works reliably EXCEPT recording to the SD card.UPDATE:  I finally got the cams to record to SD through trying various support/forum actions.  Displaying the video from the SD via playback is slow and erratic or freezes altogether.  So it works..kind of but I don't buy products in order to spend a lot of time trying to make it work as it should.,2,1,2019-12-14,1,1,0
"Very happy with this little camera.  I only have one (so far) and have it set up to see my living room, dining room and kitchen.  It is in the corner of the big room and can easily see down both walls (90 degree corner).  I have a Night Owl POE NVR system also, but one of the cameras stopped working and I didn't feel like spending $150 on a replacement camera for a system that I really don't like.  So I tried this one.The picture is very clear and night vision is actually better on this 1080P camera than the 4K Night Owl cameras I have, much better actually.  The two way audio isn't great, its weird that you can't just turn it on and talk back and forth, but it honestly isn't real important to me.",4,1,2019-9-9,1,1,1
"The camera looks nice. But I need something that works, not something that looks nice. This is by far the worst camera ever. We bought two - one for our sons nursery and another for our other kids room. The quality of the video is horrible, it’s blurry. The camera is constantly dropping off internet connection. I’m having to reconnect both camera’s multiple times through out the day. I know it’s not our internet because my husband works from home and has zero issues with our internet all day long. We have ring camera’s outside of our home and they work just fine. But I can not get these cameras to stay connected. I am constantly being kicked out of the app as well, it will freeze and then shoot me back to my home page. And when the camera does finally work it is so far behind I can walk across my whole house before it even shows I left the room. I do NOT recommend buying this camera. I had many friends recommend it because they’re so cheap. But unfortunately it is a huge waste of time and money. I will be returning both camera’s. Don’t waste your time. Go buy something that actually works.",1,1,2020-5-27,1,1,0
"Wyze is a great ""complimentary"" camera system for an existing security setting that uses a more robust AI or cloud storage offerings like Nest or Arlo.This is particularly true if you're looking to gain multiple angles to a room without breaking the bank.  The compact and well balanced design of the camera along with its magnetic base makes it less noticeable allowing it to move closer to the subject.",4,1,2018-1-30,1,3,0
"We bought this camera to keep an eye on our dog while we were on vacation. It did the trick nicely allowing us to see things day or night and even talk to her. It's fairly easy to set up. I think the UI could be improved to be more intuitive, but for $30, it's fine. If I were to do it again, I'd get the  more expensive version that has panning capability. I do wish I could connect to the camera directly with a browser and not go through a Wyze's servers. Yes, I know I can install the hacks that are on GitHub and may, but I also noticed they nix the auto switch between IR and no-IR camera. Also, it would be nice if the notifications for sound/motion were linked to the video stored on the microSD card. Now, you get 10 seconds or so of video with the notifications and then it waits a few minutes before capturing more. You can look in another area of the UI to see video recorded on the microSD card to see full clips, but none of it is linked to the notifications.",4,1,2018-11-22,1,3,0
"Best little camera I have setup and used. I have install a dozen of these cameras for friends and family without any issues. If you experience problems, before you think it’s the camera check you WiFi. People sometimes place cameras out of range and experience lag. These cameras are interior use, but I’ve installed outside and still haven’t had any issues. The Wyze app is easy to use and you can purchase add one to your camera like, motion triggers and contact sensors.Pros:",5,1,2020-7-28,1,1,0
"I actually have a full Review of this amazing little camera under the Reviews for WYZE Micro Memory card, placed by mistake while trying to catch-up my product reviews. I will sum it up on here again because the value blew me away. If you are a Do-it-yourselfer and want a small camera with excellent optics, priced well below its value, then purchase this or the Pan-Tilt model and get high quality results without all of the hassles of those other over-priced, big name cameras that fail to tell you about having to sign-up for a Pay Service that is only compatible with their equipment! This is ‘the real deal’ and I have been testing for over a month with excellent overall results. The pictures and recordings are crisp and clear and can be transferred over from the micro-card to an external hard-drive and then reviewed with whatever media player you choose to run or you can just view them right off the card on your phone/tablet, reformat and your ready to go again. This is a 5 Star+++ device and a far better option if you have a minimal technical skills to set-up and monitor by yourself. I was a skeptic but am now a believer in this little beauty and started out testing this for my children to use in their homes but will now be buying additional cams for my home. My set-up will be 3 Indoor and 3 Outdoor cams, when they become available. I’m still playing with some software that will tie them all into a library with an auto-archiving system that will automate the micro-card dump and then allow them to over-write. I hope this helps anyone looking to get their home security systems going at a cost far cheaper than anyone else!",5,1,2019-1-5,1,2,1
"I'm sure this is a great product and I've heard rave reviews, however, the portion of the setup that requires you to scan the QR code with the cam is complete BS...I have spent the last hour trying to obtain a successful scan only to finally get it and then be told my connection timed out.  I don't have time for this absolute foolishness.  For that reason alone I am incredibly unhappy with this product.**Edit:  I finally got it to scan the blasted QR code.  I set it up in my front window and it was working quite well for the first day -- then it stopped indentifying people completely and only notified me of motion and sound...right now it's doing none of the above.  I can at least get a live feed of my porch area on my Amazon Show or through the Wyze app.  I guess for $25 you get what you pay for...it's better than nothing considering I don't have a peephole on my front door.  It's also NOT wireless -- you have to plug it in.",2,1,2020-7-15,1,1,0
"I have 4 Wyzecams and 2 Wyzecam Pans.  For me, they are imperfect devices.  There are times when I've had to update the software to get them to work properly, and times when I've had to restore a previous software release, also to get full functionality.  That being said,  for a cheap surveillance device, they do provide remote eyes.  You can access them from anywhere in the world where you can connect to the internet.  Their motion tracking and detecting leave a lot to be desired.  You can put them next to a window without turning off the night lights that automatically come on after dark, otherwise you get a bad reflection from the glass.  I do find them useful to check on the dogs when their in the back yard to see what they're barking at, and to see if the mail man has come yet in the front.  Also, I have one on the front porch and don't have to go to the door and look out the peep hole to decide if I want to answer or not.  For the most part I've found them worth the money.",4,1,2020-6-4,1,1,0
"I read the reviews carefully and many of them raved about how well this camera worked when aimed outdoors. I have to disagree with many of them. I bought this indoor camera, based on those reviews, to deter thieves from taking our outdoor signs. We are concerned that if we have an outside camera, they will just steal that along with the signs.  The camera does work fine during the day, but at night, with the night  vision disabled, all we get is black.  If we could use the night vision through glass, it might  have been acceptable. Also, I thought I placed it far enough from the television, but it totally disabled our Roku device. Sadly, I will be returning it and will have to find another use for the SD card that I bought to go with it. I am hoping that the Roku device will start working again after I remove the camera. If not, this will have been an even more costly experiment. I am very disappointed and cannot recommend this product, except for indoor room monitoring.",2,1,2020-8-15,1,1,0
"I never review any products on amazon but I definitely buy thousands of things, that being said this product caught me by surprise as I was looking into video doorbells for some additional security for my ""amazon packages"". I looked at the cost and pros and cons of the current line up on the market and how they integrated with Alexa and Google Home as well as both ios and android. These cameras are light and highly accurate with color and have person detection even though it's in beta its very accurate. I have owned Arlo cameras and really thought the wireless aspect was a requirement but i was able to find mounting methods inside windows that gave me even better vantage points. For the same price as one video doorbell i now have 4 cameras set up in 2 different homes. I also spent a little extra and got 64gb sd cards for a crazy 10 dollars extra. I think that this is a mus have for people that want the extra piece of mind without any monthly bills or subcriptions and if you are in a remote area with limited outlets you could always connect to a big battery pack!",5,1,2020-6-22,1,1,0
"Update 7/11/20Fixed the unsecured wireless issue finally.  I was already switching to a competitor and like their cameras much better.  For a $5-10 you can get a camera that reliably works with your Google/Nest hub, has a desktop client, and much better picture.  And reliably works period.  It's a constant ""is it going to work this time?"" with these cameras.  They have been relegated to the lowest convenience functions and even then continue to disappoint.  The were a good value when they first came out, but certainly not anymore.",1,1,2019-2-20,1,3,0
"I guess you get what you pay for.  I bought three of these cameras from Amazon to set up around the house.  Earlier this year, we got a Reolink C2 Pro for my work place to use in a class room.  We went with that vs Wyze since I read and was told the audio quality was really poor, and we needed a cam with superb audio quality.  I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on smart cam reviews, and one guy responded by saying to get the Reolink vs Wyze.  So we did.For the house, I figured I didn't need great audio quality.  So, I bought a bunch of these cheap Wyze V2 cams.  Holy hell, when I first set up one with my Moto G6 Play, the lag and frame rate was so insanely bad, I thought I was being punked.  I tested on various wifi routers, I updated the camera firmware, I tried a bunch of settings and video quality.  It was horrendous.  Like, 10 to 15 seconds of lag with frame rate in the 5 fps range.  I read a bunch of reddit posts, and I downgraded to an older version of the app.  It became a lot better, but the lag was still several seconds at times, although the frame rate was much better.  With hardware acceleration enabled, the response time was MUCH better.  Nearly real time.  However, a new issue cropped up.  I was getting a LOT of dropped frames.  It would stream in real time, then just completely stop streaming, then stream again.  Anyways, as a last ditch, I got a new iPad from work to try.",1,1,2019-9-4,1,1,0

"I'm really at a loss at how to rate this. It doesn't do things it should and it does things it shouldn't. It will not stop recording sound. I keep setting it to low and it keeps going back up to medium. It sends alerts when I have turned off alerts. But it works on my 5 Ghz network and even when I am not connected to wifi. While the up and down swivel holds fine, the left and right is so loose that the USB cord keeps pulling it in the wrong direction. Yhe 6 foot power cord is too short to reach most ideal locations. The picture is very clear, both in regular and night vision. So, while I really like some things about this camera, other things have me contemplating returning it.Update: I have noticed that it is not consistently recording motion.  Most of the times, my dogs are sleeping on the couches on the first floor.  They were both there.  Then I get a motion alert and the recorded video shows one of the dogs coming downstairs to the first floor.  What happened to the video of the dog going upstairs before that?  Also, I have noticed that, when both sound and motion occur simultaneously, I am only alerted for the sound.",3,1,2019-7-21,1,1,0
"Wyze Cam 1080p HD Indoor Wireless Smart Home Camera is a neat little camera that works so well with the Wyze app as well as with Alexa.  I can also display the views using Alexa on my FB Portal device.However, Wyze promotes this as compatible with Google Assistant and, unfortunately, that is a very problematic integration.  While the stream from Alexa is very quick, the stream, if it is available, takes a long time to be shown on a Google hub display.  Most of the time the stream is listed as unavailable.  Relinking the devices sometimes works but the link gets broken fairly quickly.  If this issue were ever to be resolved, the camera would definitely be a 5 star product.",4,1,2019-12-17,1,1,1
"I recently put my apartment up for sale and I wanted to keep track of what goes on during the open house. As much as I like my real estate agent, you can't trust them for shit so I wanted to make sure what they're telling me is legit as well as keep track of any theft. I purchased an amcrest camera at first and, while it was decent for what I needed it to do, the setup was complicated and making adjustments to the software was a pain. I decided to look for alternatives and stumbled upon Wyze.For 25 + tax, this camera is pretty good for what it does. The setup is very easy and pretty much finishes in under 3 minutes. After that, get the app on your phone and you're good to go. Most importantly for me was the ability to store footage onto a micro sd.",5,1,2018-7-12,1,1,0
"I loved this when I got it and set it up.  Was great to be able to watch my house when on vacation away from home.  I even asked for a got a 64gb card to use in the camera for recording.  I just checked the card because the app was saying ""no card"".  When I picked up the camera it was burning hot.  When I looked at the card, it was burned around the entry of the card slot.  I removed the card with tweezers and the card was half burned.  I love cheap alternatives to expensive products, but this is straight up dangerous.",1,1,2018-1-1,1,7,1
"Great Hardware. App suffers in the video playback section. I have a 16Gb SD card in there and it records video just fine. Playing it  back is somewhat of a chore. For example, I know when my kid left at approximately 8:45. I go to the playback tab and try to find the video of his exit. I scroll to 8:45. I see nothing. Then I realize it's not playing. There is no ""Play"" button so I slowly scroll through the timeline thinking that's how I'm supposed to watch it. No luck. Never saw him leave. I finally find that it I just tap the screen (who knew?) it would start playing in real time. So after watching 3 or 4 minutes of no activity, I scroll again, tap the screen to start. I see the tail end of his exit. So I try to scroll to the minute before that and it goes back to my previous view.Bottom line, it is not easy or quick to see what is going on at any given time unless you spend many minuted of watching dead, unmoving video. The playback section of the app need better controls like a small window preview like YouTube or similar and finer grained scrolling by zoomint to a time-period, plus fast-forward/back viewing with a stop control that works. Rewind 30 seconds or FF 30 seconds would be very helpful.",3,1,2018-2-25,1,3,0

"Update: I have been using the Wyze camera for over a month now. It has definite advantages over Arlo and Blink. First off, I love the convenience of plugging in the camera to the outlet. Next you can set notifications for motion and/or sounds.  I wish there was a user-friendly way to set notification alert on instead of going into each camera and clicking three or four buttons to turn it on. There is a shortcut function but I was not able to figure it out.  I was just alerted by the sound of a knock on the door where there was no motion. My outdoor Arlo cameras did not alert me and did not pick up the motion of someone walking up the steps and knocking on the door. You can also talk through the camera which is not an option on the Arlo or Blink.  If only they made a Wyze Camera for outdoor use. I tried pointing it out the window but it doesn’t always pick up motion outside the window. Also for the price it cannot be beat.I have Arlo, blink and Wyze cameras so here’s the comparison.  All three systems allow for motion notifications and save recorded clips.  I am concerned that Wyze camera is the most hackable video of the three.  I would not put it in places where you expect privacy.",4,1,2019-7-31,1,1,0
"I have mainly higher quality cameras in my security system. However, these were cheap and I thought it might make a cheap camera for our nursery. We'd just bought a couple of Echo Shows, and since these were supposedly compatible with Alexa, it seemed like a perfect fit. However, despite following all the instructions in the Wyze app and the Amazon Alexa app, the camera is never discovered by Alexa, so is useless for that purpose, which is the main reason that I purchased it in the first place. I've updated to the most recent firmware, but it made no difference. I may be returning this.

"These little (pixar-like) Wyze v2 cubes have a wide angle view and a much more functional software than with camera freeware like Alfred. I had been using Alfred on an old phone and tablet and I tried other freeware but Alfred seemed the best for my Android devices.  I actually found this camera looking for a second-hand phone to upgrade what I was using with Alfred but I could not buy a reasonable old phone for the price of these camera cubes. Compared to Alfred advantages are that you can set up automated buttons for sleep, awake, I'm away and home on the home page, and also automate on/off by specific times. You can capture still pictures and do continuous monitoring with rewrites to a 32GB (max) SD card. Captured events can be deleted immediately and after trying capture with sound and motion, there are just too many sounds that get captured so I only capture actual motion. I also had problems with the old equipment not being able to restart after a power outage which was a problem when I was traveling but it looks like the Wyze v2 camera can be rebooted remotely. The real test of controlling this Wyze v2 camera will be on a upcoming out of country trip. If this camera continues to perform I'll be getting 1-2 more. My only complaint is that these cameras only work on 2.4 GHz wireless so I had to set up a separate channel on my router as these could not connect with an alternating 2.4/5 GHz router setting. I'm not sure why so many smart devices cannot handle 5 GHz or roving 2.4/5 GHz router settings. I am able to use the app on a phone that is set for roving 2.4/5 wireless, so maybe it is only the setup that requires your phone or tablet to be on 2.4 only wireless setting. I just keep my tablet permanently on the same 2.4 wireless as this camera and for setting up other 2.4 GHz requiring wireless equipment. Update Mar 2019 - deducted a star - I discovered after returning from my trip that Wyze had disconnected. I'm not sure when this happened as I automated settings and I could still see a live view before I left but I did not test the motion. I had to delete and add the camera again to get the camera connected again. Since then it has run fine. Before I leave on another trip I will make sure to test the motion sensor before I leave to make sure that the camera is really doing what I bought it for.

"I was very skeptical before purchasing this product. Mainly due to the critical reviews about recording in offline mode and IP address pings. But being an IT guy, I thought I can handle these aspects and test the product myself. Hence I purchased it.First thing I did after I received is that I covered the lens of the camera, even during initial setup, so that by accident camera do not capture anything I don't want it to capture. After the initial setup, I tested the motion and sound detection features and found that you will have to play with the sensor's sensitivity to find the right balance between the notifications you get and events camera can avoid notifying you about. During my testing, I tested the turned off the camera via the off button/feature in the wyze cam app. In about an hour of being offline, I didn't notice any recording done by the cam, that is avaibale for the user review. In other words, I was suspecting that the camera, maybe recording even during the offline mode, and such recordings are not shown to the users. But that is highly unlikely. So, at this point, I'm going to rule out the myth that the Wyze cam records events, even when off mode.",5,1,2019-5-23,1,3,0

"For what you get, you can’t beat it for the money. But manage your expectations. This system (I have three cameras) is often glitchy and can be somewhat unreliable in my experience 2 years into having these cameras. If you want a solid stand alone or add on system I wouldn’t go with this unless you’re okay with delays, glitches, errors in playback etc. and there software just seems behind. A new update comes out and something new is screwed up. For example, most recent update; I open up my garage camera and for the first ten seconds it’s the view from ten hours ago when I last looked at it. Then it corrects. So I turn the phone to landscape view to see it in full screen, back to 8 hours ago. Glitchy!! And my internet is not slow, I’m streaming Hulu just fine so that’s not the issue.While obvious features like 15 second skip or rewind on playback would be expected, it’s not in the software. So instead you search through your recording and the audio is off like a foreign film translated to English.

"Bought two of these cameras to keep an eye on my dogs while we are at work during the day. I was initially very excited about these cameras. I have a coworker that uses them of the same reason and she hasn’t had any issues which is what enticed me to do the same. The price point is great and the quality of the picture is great too. The camera does lag a little as the play back is slightly delayed but nothing terrible. I was disappointed with the length of the chords that came with them. No where in the description does it say how long the chords are supposed to be. So I had to pull the user manual off of here to search for it. It said they came with 6ft chords. I thought that should be perfect to at least reach from the outlet to the top of the wall. Unfortunately the chord I got is shorter than 6 feet and does not reach. Buying a longer chord won’t be an issue as it uses a simple USB. But knowing in advance would have been nice so I could have ordered it at the same time. The 2 way audio is nice but could be improved. I noticed you have to hold down the microphone button for a few seconds after you finish talking or else it cuts off the end of what you’re saying. Sometimes even if you do that it still cuts off what you say. I do like that i can share the camera view with my fiancé and he can use his own account instead of us sharing one account. My next issue is that one of the cameras seems defective. The camera we got for our kitchen works perfectly, but the one for the living room consistently goes “offline”. Which you cannot reset from your app. The only way to fix it is to either restart your WiFi router or unplug the camera from the wall and plug it back in. Unfortunately I cannot do that if I am away from the house and completely defeats the purpose of having the camera in the first place. After a few times of having to reset it while I was home, it no longer reconnects. The app shows the issue is the camera cannot connect to the WiFi but the issue clearly isn’t our connection if the other camera is working fine, which leads me to believe this one is defective. I went ahead and ordered a replacement which should be here tomorrow. If all is well I will update my review. If it does not work I’m wondering if paying the extra money for the ring cameras would be worth it.",3,1,2020-2-4,1,1,1
"I love my Wyze v2. I am so happy with this little IP camera. There are so many cheap smart cams out there, when you are trying to pick one, it's hard to know which you should get. This is the one. I have another camera by Netvue that costs twice the price of the Wyze and it's not even half as good and the Netvue app is terrible. The Wyze app is so much better. In the last week they have added an on/off option so you don't have to unplug it when you are home (for privacy).This camera has good smart home integration, also. It supports IFTTT and finally Alexa!  The overall performance of the camera itself is really good too. Keep in mind that it has a rate of 15 frames, which is a bit less than you would get on a $100 security camera, but this thing costs $25. Also, keep in mind that you must have a smartphone or tablet to set this camera up and view the footage. I know that in 2018 it would be hard to believe that ANYONE doesn't have an Android/iOS device, but there are still one or two of them out there. This camera has a micro SD slot which is the only way store the recordings (most cameras offer a cloud recording option for a fee). Now they do save 12 or 15 second clips that you can enable by turning on motion/sound activation, so that if you are not home, and there is motion in front of the camera, it will record briefly and then save it for 2 weeks. However I would highly recommend using a memory card, after installed, the videos stored on the card can be viewed from any device with the Wyze app installed and logged into your account. Highly recommend!",5,1,2018-7-19,1,3,0
This has been a great camera for the time I've had it which is a little over a year at this point. I use it to monitor my garage which does not get a great WiFi signal so that's an issue for this camera. It does manage to work and upload clips it is just slow to view the stream sometimes.It's been a decent camera overall but with all the privacy concerns with it I do not think I would have on in my house.,4,1,2019-11-17,1,1,0
"Motion sensing is useless. This camera detects leaves and grass movement which makes it alert every couple of seconds. Since it doesn't support activity zones there is no way to filter out areas with movement. So the only option is to turn off motion detection which turns this camera into a dumb video camera. Also, the video quality is mediocre.",2,1,2018-4-21,1,7,0
"I tried other inexpensive security cameras, but none worked well, and none had any of the myriad of features this one has.  I can set it to alert for noise, or motion, or motion in just part of the viewing field.  I can set the sensitivity of both, set it to alert or not, to have night vision or not, or auto.  It has a microphone, and it saves several days of video to the server and my SD card.  It can even do time lapse.Additionally, the app is very advanced, amd works flawlessly, and WYZE is an AMERICAN company, with customer service in the US, so it's easy to communicate with them.  Furthermore, the Wyze forum has areas for suggestions, peer help, upcoming improvements, and customer service, and they really do take the suggestions and problems of their customers seriously.  New ideas and improvements are largely from their customers.  How cool is that?",5,1,2019-8-18,1,1,0
"Updated Review September 2018: After some back and forth with the folks at Wyze Cam, they diagnosed the problem and ended up swapping out my camera within the warranty period. The new camera works smoothly so far and I'm pretty pleased. A bit of a struggle to get to this point, I think their customer service was overwhelmed. Hopefully this new one (v2, original was v1) doesn't have the same power cycle issues.Updated Review June 2018: I can not recommend this camera to anyone. It constantly tells me to cycle the power with an error code in the app. When it does connect, I have trouble downloading the videos, which fail with a generic message. I've contacted Wyze Labs with multiple support tickets over the past month but have not received a reply or a solution.",4,1,2018-4-2,1,2,0
"I waited over a month to leave this review. The verdict is in: my husband and I LOVE these cameras! There are a lot of ridiculously picky people out there who love to rain on parades (c'mon people, you know who you are) and list all the ways these cameras fall short. Let me tell you--I have professional grade security cameras that were installed on the exterior of my home, and we paid a lot of money to have that done, so I do know about expectations. These adorable little cameras that almost beg to be named were purchased for fun, because we already have cameras. We placed 1 on a shelf overlooking our foyer and front doors and the other 1 on our screened-in patio. Set-up was a breeze and the quality of picture was surprisingly good. The 2-way audio is a bonus. One day while visiting family I decided to open the app and talk to my cat who was visible on the camera. Suddenly I heard my husband, who was at work, asking if I was already home. He had opened the app and while viewing live he heard me calling our cat. Our family likes technology, so we're already familiar with the convenience of Google Home, and Amazon Echo; we use both in our home. But these cameras offer a lot for an astonishingly low price, and we found that though we bought these for fun, we have come to appreciate the extra layer of security they provide to our home. The app for viewing livestream and recordings works great. FYI we added the 32 GB MicroSD card for added memory.",5,1,2018-5-10,1,3,0
"It has awesome picture quality, but it’s just so extremely unreliable. You can’t assume it will be on when you need it to be. I loved it when I first got it and ended up buying a lot of them because the first one was so impressive. But over time, I’ve realized that it’s completely unreliable. The cameras are unreachable half the time, they require rebooting all the time, recorded video is almost never saved to the SD card even though I have it set to record continuously, and I don’t always get notifications. It seems to be a combination of firmware, hardware, and software/app problems. It’s good for watching pets, but it can’t be relied on as a security camera. I’ve gone to the office and found people sitting at the rear entrance in full view of the camera without getting any notifications. I also randomly check the app once in a while and sometimes, when the camera is working, I find people and cars in the parking area right in front of the camera when no notifications were sent. The camera is indoors behind a window, so it’s not being used as an outdoor camera. The cameras covering the inside of the office have the same issues as well.",2,1,2020-8-1,1,1,0
"I have purchased 2 of the same Wyze cams to monitor the front of the house and the inside the house.  The daytime and night visions are all excellent.  The recording features have been so useful in many ways to monitor what happened in and around the house.  The price is also strong point of the device.  I recommend the product to anyone looking for economic security cam solution.One down side I have noticed is with the night vision.  I placed one of the Wyze cam behind the upstairs window looking down the street.  At night time, the IR light coming out from the cam is reflected to the screen and the picture quality is not so great, hence I had to turn off the IR light.  Also when I turned on interior light where the cam is placed behind the window, the white camera surface shows the reflection at night and it is hard to see the image.  It would be great if cam comes in black color.",5,1,2019-11-27,1,1,0
Several buzzwords are helpful to know when discussing IP cameras like this.OMVIF - Open Network Video Interface Forum.  A camera that supports this can be easily configured to be usable with just about any standard IP camera type viewer.  Such as a Roku channel and various apps.,3,1,2019-4-1,1,1,0
"I'd really like to give this camera more than one star, I really like the company, and they have a pretty good app, but both cameras I tried had issues.The first camera I ordered worked fine, but would not recognize that a SD card was inserted. I was using a new SD card, recommended by Amazon, and I did check to see it met the specs (32GB, Class 10, etc.). I contacted Wyze customer support, and made it clear that I had tried reformatting the card, and that the card works in every other device I put it into. Their answer was that I needed to use a Wyze branded memory card. Complete BS, but OK. Also, Wyze will not support or do any type of exchange for hardware issues, unless purchased direct from them, so I returned to Amazon, took a chance, and re-ordered another camera.",1,1,2019-7-9,1,1,0
"Two cameras, both offline within 24 hours of deployment, and no way to correct the issue from 1400 miles away.  Other devices on the same network (IP cameras, smart plugs, and computer are all online while the Wyze cams remain inaccessable.) The picture quality is surprisingly good, the motion detection and ""person detection"" seem to function well, but if the cameras cannot perform the simple function of re-acquiring a connection automatically, they're worthless.  If I return the cameras, then I'm stuck with $30+ in accessories I bought to go with them. Not happy at all with this purchase.",1,1,2019-9-26,1,2,0

"Well actually I'd give it a Meh+.  I got this to monitor Amazon ""Key"" deliveries. (Amazon's deal with liftmaster/chamberlain to allow in garage deliveries.) Without jumping through hoops it doesn't work well at all for that purpose. The hardware/picture quality is fine for my needs. The basic software parts are there too but, unless I just can't figure it out, are a bit brain dead.Here is my process and the issues.  I first put it in the garage facing the garage door. The garage door, ironically enough, takes 12 seconds to rise. So by the time someone walks in the cloud recorded event is over. (Yes I've got a sd card and can manually go see if that particular event was my Amazon dude but what a needless waste of time.) I then positioned it near the garage door so it didn't 'see' the garage door opening figuring the person walking in would trigger the motion. That didn't work either because it quickly senses the change of light as the door opens.",3,1,2019-8-30,1,2,0
"Just got mine in the mail today, did the easy setup, and instantly got access to the video feed via the Wyze app. It works great and I had no issues with it. However, it's advertised to work with Alexa, which is why I purchased it, and followed the correct instructions to update the firmware and link it with Alexa. It's confirmed to be linked via the Wyze app and the Alexa app. When I say correct commands to view the feed on my Echo Show and Fire Sticks I am only given an ""OK"" by Alexa and the screen flashes. It does not connect. I'm tried re-enabling the Wyze skill, re-pairing the devices, power cycling them all, and resetting them, but it does not work.After about 2 hours of doing all of this, searching online for answers, and chatting with Amazon's support, nothing seemed to work. The camera was just not working with the Amazon products.",2,1,2019-12-16,1,1,0
"Really like the product, easy to setup and works.  It took about 5 minutes to setup, including the time to download the iOS app.  I have much more expensive cams that don’t compare in video quality or ease of setup.

The iOS app is ok and bet it will be improved over time, it’s not bad just basic.",5,1,2017-11-19,1,6,0
"I bought 2 of these and they were originally great buys. But, within 2 mos., they required near monthly manual re-boots. At about 9 mos., 1 died entirely, with lots of heat during reboot attempts for such a small USB powered device. The remaining camera needs reboot about 1 a month. Tempting price, but unreliable.

"All these years I was using Arlo by Netgear , Expensive and terrible system that kept loosing connectivity . I would go on vacation and not be able to Monitor my Property and was so frustrated, Now all my problems are history. WYZE was easy to install and I have not lost Connectivity at all whats so ever , I am so please with the quality of these Cameras . I have three Cameras and the coverage is incredible , The software is easy to use web based ,No bulky DVR boxes or Wireless routers to deal with , JUST PLUG AND PLAY. What really makes me happy is that the Motion Sensor Feature tells you if it is A Person or Just Motion and marks it in the description , The mic feature is cool , You Can hear conversations from a far distance . The only complaint I have is the Video Clips are only 12 secs, I hope they will come up with a upgrade. Note these cameras are made more inside BUT I put them outside with the outside housing kit found on Amazon and the install is easy . I highly recommend this product.",5,1,2020-7-28,1,1,0

All videos or pictures can be saved in the app. Movement alerts can be scheduled and videos are sent to your device.  The only con I note is video scrubbing. It takes a slow hand to review past videos within the app, you need to scroll slowly on the time bar in the video review. Other than that, at the price point, I love this gadget !

"UPDATED: I'm leaving my original review below, but my opinion has changed on this camera. Although I have a real deal, high quality, professional surveillance system, and the Wyze cam will, unfortunately, never be a part of it, this camera DOES come in handy.In fact, if you don't have high end surveillance, the Wyze cameras could serve as a VERY economical alternative. The video quality is good, night vision good and with an optional SD card, saved motion activated recordings rival that of the high dollar systems.",4,1,2019-1-1,1,1,0
"This camera spies on YOU.  I had this camera powered by a smart switch, which allowed me to completely cut all power to the camera.  Upon powering up the camera and using it and analyzing its operation over several months, I can confidently say that this is not for me.  Does it work, provide a good picture, and priced well.  Yes, yes, yes.  BUT, why have your video data pass through servers in China?  You get what you pay for, sure the price is good but at a cost of your own privacy.  Invest your money in a more reputable and ethical platform.  That being said I strongly recommend you do your own research because, most camera companies will do the same as Wyze.  This is sad.",2,1,2020-4-25,1,2,0
"I really wanted to like this camera to watch my garage. At this price point, it seemed like a smart alternative to other cameras, especially if you need more than one. Unfortunately, I wasted my money. After some very frustrating weeks of experimenting and testing, I’ve reached the conclusion that this camera is a completely unreliable toy camera and you should not rely on it for any security.First of all, connections to the camera are continuously and randomly lost, resulting in a range of different error messages and missed footage about 80% of the time. Many of the error messages don’t even make sense (for example suggesting to switch from HD to SD when it’s already recording on SD, or changing the network connection of my phone). I ended up power cycling the camera to reset it many times per day. But how are you supposed to do this when you’re traveling, and rely on the camera for home security? No surprise that on my recent trip the camera was offline for 3 weeks with nothing I could do about it.",3,1,2019-7-16,1,1,1

"The very first thing you need to know about the Wyze camera, notwithstanding all the positive reviews that don't even mention it, is this:  The product is deliberately limited--it will record 12-second videos when it detects motion, and then it will simply stop for 5 minutes and not record again.  When I was originally checking reviews I did come across this limitation, but it wasn't clear if it applied just to videos that were uploaded online.  Personally I don't need to send lots of useless video up to ""the cloud""; for me it should be stored on the camera's own SD card, and this works well enough.  But the recording limitation applies even if you're using your own SD card.  So I checked the menus and found no way to make any changes, and then tried to send the company feedback via the menu in its Android app; apparently they don't receive the feedback though--it seems that it's just used as a prompt to bring up suggested topics.  It was only then that I discovered you can get an actual full-time working security camera if you're willing to pay for a monthly subscription for ""Complete Motion"" as they call it.  Now when I buy a device like this I expect to install an SD card, then plug in the camera and it should be up and running and doing what it's designed to do; I don't want an ""ongoing billing relationship"" with the company.  This is a deliberately limited product, and in my view that's being hidden from first-time buyers, so unless you want to pay this company on an ongoing basis I suggest you look at the many other options for security cameras.",2,1,2020-2-27,1,1,0
"For the price, it's an amazing camera. (5 stars!)There is zero lens polarization on it--none at all.  This means if you aim it through a glass window, in some scenarios you'll get a lovely hi-def video of the reflections off of the glass. (-1 star.)",2,1,2020-3-23,1,1,0

I turned it off and the cameras have been rock solid ever since. I have a ton of other WiFi cameras and the Wyze are the only ones that didn't get along with AF.My only complaint is Wyze image quality is a tad soft and focus falls off significantly as distances increases but the cameras are perfectly usable. For $25.00 you get a decent, full-featured camera (2-way audio and IR) that's a great value and ridiculously easy to setup.",4,1,2018-12-9,1,1,0

The Shows show good image quality but I will have to get a router to use as an access point because the plug in repeater isn't strong enough.  I made the mistake of unplugging the repeater and moving it hoping to get a stronger signal and now the Wyze cams won't show on the Show, but I hear sound - the wind blowing.

For note: I have a 300Mbps/20Mpbs download/upload band so if it can't work at this level, it won't work anywhere (router is a nighthawk x7000).",2,1,2020-5-30,1,1,0
"For the price, these are amazing. Motion detection, automatic night vision, microphone for both video sound and speaking back through it, SD card ready, recording for motion detection. The video is GREAT. I bought some outdoor mounts from a third party and even after rain these are holding up great. The app is easy to use, and after I figured out that putting my cameras in a group allows me to see them all at once, it made monitoring my security system so much easier. If you have an SD card installed, you can scroll through recorded video as far back as the storage allows. I have 64GB cards in each of mine and usually record in HD and it still saves a lot of data. Once the card is filled up, it automatically records over old data. Really just a smooth recording system. The flat cable was a great touch since I set these up outside and needed the cable to be able to fit through a window seal while still allowing the window to close and lock.I will say that I wish I could change the automatic motion detection recording settings to more or less than 12 seconds, since there is a delay and once I actually view the recording , it’s 30-60 seconds after it happened. The motion detection is also pretty sensitive even after turning the sensitivity WAY down. I’ll get notifications if the sun comes in and out of clouds quickly, or if there is heavy wind moving trees, but weirdly not if a skunk or animal is crossing my yard. This specific model isn’t meant for outdoor use though so that’s more just a minor complaint if you use these outside and not an actual negative item about the product or app.",5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,1

So I’ve bought a $90 security camera and a $160 baby monitor. Well let’s just say Ive used this for both ! I originally bought it for outdoors bc neighbors were coming Into my yard and messing with things. Then the baby came .... this camera works by far the best. And the best part is it’s on everyone’s phone. So me dad and big sister (she really wanted it) all have the app on our phones and get notifications when needed. The quality of the video is seriously better than both previous cameras I mentioned. The night vision is spectacular and you don’t NEED an sd card if you don’t plan on recording events for longer than 12 seconds after the sound / motion detection. (Which are all saved within the app By time and date and can be saved to your phone for sharing) 10:10 recommend for all of the things. Now I don’t use it for sleeping since the baby sleeps in our room. But if we’re out on the porch or shower or another room it’s used. Especially hot summer days when my 4 year old wants to play outside but I don’t want to bring the baby out in the heat or she’s sleeping.,5,1,2020-8-29,1,1,0
"For $25 I did not have high hopes, but I was wrong. I don't know how they are making any money, because this camera works well. Too good for its low price. I bought it to keep an eye on my vehicles when I am traveling as a garage cam only and it has so far proven to be VERY reliable. Always accessible. Instant notifications. The picture is not perfect but its good enough. The playback is excellent. The setup was simple as can be. The size is perfect and the mounting options are great, I really like the magnetic back. The ONLY quirks are relating to setting the motion and sound sensitivities, they are a little too good so you really need to limit the sensitivity and also the motion detection area to a minimum. I have one home that is 100% nest and another that is 100% ring, cameras, sensors, alarm, the whole 9. This Camera is a fraction of nest or ring and its a close runner up. Its not weatherproof....but you can mount them interior looking out a window or inside anywhere and get great security for a very affordable price.

"I bought one of these so I can see who's at my door. I'm too short to use the peephole, and I want to be able to stay far away if I suspect something's weird. It picks up a lot of motion, although its A.I. can be a little quirky. Sometimes it tells me that the clouds are allowing a big patch of sunlight, and other times it doesn't notice me walking right by it. It's pretty religious about alerting me when vehicles pass by. I think obstructions can affect how it interprets motion, so I recommend keeping its view clear. I have a railing that it sees, and I think that throws it off when it breaks my shape up too much due to my height.The creators are always working to improve the algorithms and are very honest. You know how you'll find out your email provider had a security breach a year and a half ago? These guys found out someone was trying to access data, so they sorted it out, and within just a few days they sent out emails to all users to report the incident, what was accessed, and what to do to make sure their accounts were secure.

The setup was the easiest of all of my cameras. The app needs improvement. It has a scheduler which actually works. My biggest complaint is the looks. The white cube is like waving a red flag. Hey, here is my security camera. Definitely not unobtrusive.Update 2/19/19",1,1,2018-12-26,1,2,0
"The camera works well. Easy enough to set up, clear picture, good night vision, etc. All the features described work just as advertised. However.....WYZE customer service is the worst I have ever experienced.",1,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"For $25 it does its basic job. I use it as a test camera because I have better ones that cost waaay more and do better.  I rated it low on night vision because I have this camera pointed outside and it does not show very well depending on where I place it. I would say looking at indoors it would do fine in the dark. The biggest complaint I have on this camera is the free clips it gives you to save to the cloud. They are only 12 second clips. If someone steals your camera then they have all of your live footage and what you are left with is 12 second clips that can only be 5 minutes apart. In otherwords, once it takes the 12 sec clip, it will not do another one for 5 minutes. Thus you are left to pay for the service if you want the clips to be longer.  So you better hope you get a good image of who the intruder is within the 12 seconds. Mount your camera wisely. Then again, as cheap as it is, you can purchase several to help with this and hope one would capture the face or good image of intruder. The time it takes to send the clip seems to be fairly quick. Usually I get notified within 3 minutes after the event happened to be able to look at the 12 second clip or live view.",4,1,2020-1-22,1,1,0
"I thoroughly understand the security issues that have been involved with Wyze and their products. I'm not a tech specialist and I can't tell you whether it sends information to China. I can tell you that I'm concerned enough about it that I wouldn't put it in my bedroom. I wouldn't put any camera in my bedroom, though. I also keep it separated from most of my home network.For my purposes it's fantastic. Cheap, reliable, good software, easy to use, solid night vision as well as motion detection and if a foreign agency wants to look at the mess on my patio, good for them.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,2,0
"Great stuff. I use two of these to monitor the outside of a vacation rental when no one is home, along with a Wyze Pan cam for $10 more. Cheap enough to buy a few and monitor pets, property, mouse traps, etc. The quality is good enough for its price - 1080p @ 15 FPS. No additional costs for subscriptions and you get 12 second alert videos. You can see your cameras and alerts from anywhere. A few bucks for an SD card will give you 24-hour recordings saved to the card that you can scrub through (tediously) in your app. It will automatically switch to night mode complete with ir LEDs to light the dark. I used one to figure out a neighborhood cat comes around at night and poops in my back yard. I had no idea! Consistent updates add continuous improvements. These will also integrate with their motion sensors for all kinds of creativity. They show up in my Alexa app so I suspect they can be used with an Echo Show like my Ring doorbell can (but I don’t have a Show so I can’t confirm).Cons: Needs a better way to navigate the recorded video. Too many events triggered by bugs at night so I had to schedule it off at night. Audio quality is poor, if that’s a necessary feature for you. Sometimes they have trouble connecting 3 video streams to the poor network at my rental.",5,1,2019-9-14,1,1,0
"I have been mulling over the purchase of some higher end cameras for around the house, but decided to pick a couple of these up last minute before a vacation, just to keep an eye on the dogs and dog-sitter.  At the pricepoint, I expected a bit of hassle or finickiness with the cameras or app--but both cameras and the app worked flawlessly for me over the 10 days we used them.Setup of each camera took just a couple minutes, and was as easy as could be.  Plug them in, fire up the app, press a button to activate setup mode, scan a QR code from my phone, give them a few minutes to update firmware, and you are off and running.",4,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

I tested the camera a few times walking out in the hall and tried using it when I left and every time I switched to a different app on my phone the camera stopped recording. Once I watched the live stream and it appeared it was recording for 20 minutes, but it did not save. I purchased the SD Card with the camera. I have read all of the forums, reset the camera, the app, the SD card, my wifi router and after numerous hours wasted I give up. I am returning the Wyzcam and purchased what I hope is a functioning camera.

"Edit... I did the firmware flash to the previous version and everything seemed to work now except when viewing from notifications, but just a few more days later and the camera won't connect to app at all. I reset the wifi but with no success. Will have to RE-setup the cam... AGAIN. the app crashes about 90% off the time ... Not an exaggeration... And has to restart. if the camera does not ""connect"" i cannot restart it or reboot it remotely, i have to pull out the 6' ladder and do it manually!  The picture is clear and the motion capture is is priced better than the Ring plan. The camera is definitely a good deal once you get it flashed and reset.

"Had to give this camera 5 stars; I purchased 3 of these for my office last month as we relocated downstairs from floor 2 to ground and I felt unsafe; generally speaking I always wanted a camera but didn't know which brand or type; or even deal with annoying setups. Since Amazon recommended this along with the reviews I decided on this camera;Long story short, this was a 1-2-3 install (with some accessories purchased from third-party vendors I wish Wyse sold eg: outlet mount); I setup the schedule from 9pm to 8am to alert me when there's motion;",5,1,2019-11-21,1,1,1
"I hate that I only leave reviews for when I absolutely love something and am blown away or when something is just so bad it’s pushed me to writing a negative review. Well, here is one of those times, and unfortunately I did no absolutely love this. It was difficult getting this to scan the QR code to register, I gave that a pass because I had the same issue with a SimpliSafe camera before. I needed to reset this to retry scanning the QR code and instructions online for this is really unclear. The best method was leaving the camera unplugged and then after 5+ mins plug it back in and try setting it up again. I tried doing the steps I found and that didn’t work (unplug for 30 or so seconds - plug back in and the yellow light should begin flashing. It mentions this may take up to 5 mins. I waited nearly 15 and it still did not allow me to go into setup mode after pressing the setup button)Anyway, I finally get it connected. I immediately, needed to update the firmware. Afterwards, I couldn’t get a live stream. I had to reset the camera again. I finally get it connected a 2nd time and shortly after, the connection stops working. It stays frozen on a frame and never picks back up. At this point I’m done for the evening and unplug it. The next morning I plug it in and check the app and it connects. A few minutes after it stops working again. I’m not confident in this product actually working or working long term for anyone. Maybe I just got a dud or I’m doing something incorrectly but this has been problematic.",2,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"Ok, for $25 u can’t ask too much out of a little camera like this right. Well outside of that I was very surprised. Was only difficult trying to scan the UPC code. Had to lay it down and then scan. Took me quite a long time to figure that out. This is coming from a guy that can tear apart windows/Mac laptops and repair those problems so why was this such a pain in the ass. Have some other ones that were a lot more expensive but also set up real easy.Ok so this little camera will handle quite a lot and gives u a nice picture and alert. You can’t change directions on this unit by application. Only can be done physically.. For my purpose this little guy is fine. Had a weak entry spot that I wanted a bit more coverage on. House is alarmed very well but visible detection is important. What I found most compelling was the night vision. Completely the best I ve seen. Not that I have tons of info but I was really surprised on how well it views a completely dark area like it was daylight. There are no visible led lights that will alert someone as to this effect which is awesome for me. Wish my more expensive ones could do that. I am talking 90$ plus and they can’t give me this view. I think the app needs work and maybe for these devise to play better with other apps. I would of like to link this to my zwave devises. So it’s not a do all devise but for a little info maybe like for a child’s room and watching what ur dog is doing is all good.",4,1,2019-2-8,1,1,1
"Who knew you could get a wi-fi camera that works this well for so little money.  2-way audio is sketchy, but we don't really need it so it doesn't matter.  It's a little laggy, but it's wi-fi, what can you expect.  The motion detection works quite well, just play with the positioning until you get it aimed for optimal detection and you're set.  We use it at our reception desk when the receptionist steps away.  Her backup person has the app on her phone and it alerts her when someone comes in.  She can glance at the app to see who it is (sometimes employees enter and exit past the reception desk) and then quickly go to the reception area if it's a visitor.  This allows the relief person to continue with her work at her own desk while still monitoring the reception area.  We haven't tested the night vision, didn't even know it had night vision--we don't need it here.  Works great for us, no issues with the device at all.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,1,0
I bought the camera and it worked fine for awhile. Then it quite working for no reason. I called tech support and spent along time on the phone to no avail.

"I bought this on a whim because people were snooping around our neighborhood. There are some pluses and negatives here. This is meant to be an INDOOR camera, it is not meant to be looking out through windows. While it can do that in the day fairly well, at night it needs it's IR lights to see in the dark. You will quickly find out that if your camera is against a window, those lights will reflect off the window and will ""blind"" the camera. You can try angling it, but I could never get it to work, and even then the lights weren't strong enough to make it through the window anyways. This problem can be solved by turning off the IR lights entirely within the app, and then buying a separate IR emitter like a Tendelux and placing it somewhere else to shine on the area you want to see. This works FANTASTIC paired with the Wyze.So, now you've got a working camera looking out of your window for day and night. How are the features? Most cameras make you sign up for a monthly service to store clips on their servers. They also charge extra for motion detection, or person detection. Wyze gives you all this for FREE. There are no hidden or extra costs. It will keep 15 days of clips on their servers.",5,1,2019-8-16,1,0,0
"These cameras aren't the best thing in the world, but they are definitely good for the price. No ethernet support or native RTSP is unfortunate. I use the RTSP firmware so I can manage the recordings in Blue Iris. The cameras gone offline a couple times even with great Wi-Fi coverage in my house, and they sometimes had trouble connecting when booting up. The intercom function is terrible and practically useless. No PIR motion sensing so leaves blowing in the wind will trigger it. Browsing recordings on the SD card is extremely slow through the app. But for $23, the picture quality and night vision are about as good as I could expect.  Likely the best option for a camera this cheap, just don't expect too much.",4,1,2020-7-28,1,1,0
"Our son came to visit for three weeks with their two month old.  We needed a baby Cam.  I read the specs and thought that I would try this out.  I purchased this along with a 10 gb card so we could set up continuous recording. It arrived quickly.  Setup was just as the instructions stated and I downloaded their app. I played with the various settings (along with motion and sound) to determine the best for our situation.  Because the alerts were coming to my phone every time (each clip is 12 seconds)  it wore me out answering and then deleting them (I set this up in a high traffic area in our house to help me adjust settings). Once I figured out that if I set it up for continuous recording I turned the alerts off as we were streaming in the house live.  It just worked great for the three weeks they were here.  There was about a one second delay but that didn't matter.  The livestream of the infant was great in low / no light with the IR turned on.  The live stream does not go to their servers but stays local.  I tested that by leaving my WiFi router running and unplugging the internet coming in.  It still streamed in the house on my local network.  I first downloaded and setup the app on an apple I-Pad.  It would run from 1 to 3 hours on livestream and then shut off.  I went to the WYZE forums and did research.  Others had this issue also (need to mention that my I-Pads are very old but work great yet) on certain devices.  I switched over to using my old Nexus 6P that last had android updates in 2018 and it worked flawlessly and never shut off.  It just streamed.  Last item.  You can set the picture quality at 360p, Std def, and HD.  If the memory gets full on the card it just overwrites.  If I recall correctly continuous recording at Std def will last about two days before overwrite.",4,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0

"I am revising my original review with more stars. I started off with one camera, and it was fun in the beginning to find such an inexpensive camera that I could check-in on my dog while I was at work. Then, I bought more cameras to put in my windows so I could monitor what was going on around my home. I have a total of 6 cameras inside and out.  The square camera in my garage will often go offline and I can't get a live streaming picture.  I've had to plug and replug several times.  I've had no issues getting the live stream with the rest of my cameras.  I only use the SD card in one (tall) camera and I've finally gotten that to work.  For the price, this is an excellent item but don't expect it to do the job of professional security system.  I have an Alexa but I haven't hooked it up so I can't comment on that.  I LOVE that the camera is made here in the USA and not China.  When I've had questions, the Messenger app works better than email.",3,1,2019-3-26,1,1,0

"All I can say is WOW!!!  This little cam was so easy to set up and the quality is amazing....  All I really wanted was a camera to keep an eye on my mailbox out by the road and any traffic to and from my front porch for package  delivery and such.  I was initially a little disappointed when I missed my wife pulling in the garage because the 5 minute cool down period between alerts had not reset.  But, after doing a little reading I saw where this can be bypassed with the use of a micro SD card which I had installed during the set up.  So, once I knew what I was doing, I was able to scrub back and locate her arrival along with all other activity between alerts.  It is my understanding that my 32 GB SD card can store 3 days of continuous recording and as I have set it to only record alerts, I would think it should last at least twice as many days.  I paid $25 for this cam and so far it is worth every dollar I spent and I am already planning to purchase a few more for me and you can bet I may get them as gifts this year for friends and family.",5,1,2018-5-2,1,2,0
"As much as i like the fact how cheap this is compared to other security/live cameras i would recommend to pass on these.. Why? because I started with getting 2 of these and then kept adding till i had 7 and realized how this is not adding any value to my needs. Now i regret spending money on these and should have rather gotten something little expensive but that actually works as live cam.So this or the other version of wyze cam (Pan tilt) when you have multiple of them put together and you open the app it doesn't automatically connect to your cameras. You have to individually click on every camera to load the connection (Which is delayed by further 5-10 seconds). First you can't see more than 1 live camera at same time, you will have to go back and forth and only 1 camera at a time, second every time you switch cameras you have wait for it to load.",1,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"At $25 I decided to take a chance on this camera to replace a no-name 720 camera that was decent for the 6 years I had it in service.  I am running a Blue Iris system in my home and after seeing that rtsp use was possible, I decided it was time to upgrade.  Out of the box and getting it up and going with the Wzye app on my Android phone was simple and straightforward.  Once I did that, I grabbed my handy dandy spare SD card and download the RTSP firmware from Wyze (just google it) and follow the directions to get the .bin file and install the firmware.  It was a little painful to get the camera to work with Blue Iris.  I added it with the ""http"" protocol in Blue Iris even though you the rtsp URL in the Wzye app to use.  So, the format I used was ""http"" and then the ""<user>:<password>@<ip addresss>/live"", select the ""Make"" to ""Wyze"" and this will pull up the ""Model"" which will be ""V2 with OpenIPC firmware RTSP"".  Make sure your ""Path"" setting is set to ""/live"" in the ""Video"" section.  Set the Media/video/RTSP port"" to ""554"".  At first, I didn't get a connection to the camera.  I had to toggle the ""Use RTP/UDP ports"" on and then clicked ""OK"" and then the camera was connected.  I don't know why this made it work as I didn't see this in any other instructions I found online.  I have had this working for the last 12 hours so i hope it lasts.  I do worry that a power cycle (on/off) of the camera or a reboot of my server will cause it to not to connect again and I have to go in and manually start.  Good luck!One more thing... after upgrading the firmware, the Wzye app on your phone still works and gets the streaming video.  It only adds the RTSP option.",4,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"Update  3 on 1/5/2020-  After a very slight brownout/power drop, all my Wyze cameras lost their internet connection and never reset.  I didn't know this for days.

NO web interface of any kind is available, even though all the traffic for the camera's live view goes over LAN if you are on the same network, and not over the internet like Amazon's own Cloudcam does for example. This fact alone should make a web interface very easy to deploy. Per their forums they say that it is the number one feature request but that they have no plans to implement it. Seems like they really don't care about their customers that much.",1,1,2019-2-20,1,1,0

Considering there is no fee . The app is free. We purchased one to see how well it worked. They are made for inside.  We liked the first one so we'll we purchased another regular one and one that moves. We put one outside and the only problem we have with that is it picks up wind noise even on must sensitive setting. But it covers the area we want to see. We highly recommend these camera. There a great value. Easy to set up and install. We where 100 miles away and our house alarm ( simplesafe) was tripped. The cameras gave us the ability to look at what was going on. Watched the police pull in to our yard and secure our property ( God bless our police officers) kept us from racing home in the middle of the night . Also gave us peace of mind.

"Wow, great price and free online storage.  Sold!  I bought 6 of them about a year ago.  1 lost power.  The USB cable melted itself inside the USB port at the camera.  1 of them would record, but wouldn't let me view live video.  And Surprise, when I tried to unplug it the USB cable, it had welded itself to the USB port as well.The online video storage only gives you 12 seconds of video,very 5 minutes.  If you want to save useful video, you will have to add an SD card.  Coupled with its poor ""motion detection"", you're going to be very disappointed.  Let me tell you about motion detection.  It's not true motion detection.  It detects changes in the video pixels.  It will record every insect, animal, moving plant and stray beam of light.  But it has no interest in human beings, especially the ones committing crimes.  Let me splain... One of them is pointed at the parking lot of my business.  This thing records the cast of headlight beams on objects of every car that passes by, but doesn't catch cars driving right in front of its face.  Someone borrowed my shop truck.  I wanted to find out who.  There was no video of the truck ever leaving!  Nor did it capture the fuel being siphoned from my truck, the graffiti being painted on the trailer, theft of my jerry cans, creeper being stolen, the time someone dumped a water heater at our back door...  In most of these instances, zero seconds of video.  I once saw a person's leg enter the scene, then it gets cut off.  At my house, I have one at the gate aimed at the street.  It loves insects flying by at night, spider webs in the wind, my neighbor's headlights 200 feet away... But last night, between the insects and spiderwebs, I got video of a dog peeing on my ficus at 3:45 AM.  20 minutes later when a dude went through my mailbox 30 feet away, no video.  My neighbor's ""cheap Chinese camera"" detected motion and recorded it at 4:05 AM.  I have landscape lights beaming up the palm plant under the mailbox.  So, it can't tell me it was too dark.",1,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
"I purchase 2 of these after reading other good reviews, and considering its low price. However, it turned out an useless brick at home.First problem is the motion detector, that is not and actual sensor. The camera actually has software that compares frame by frame images and triggers the motion alert when too many pixels have changed. The problem with this is when you have changes in lighting it triggers the alert. In my case, the camera is pointed at the door and the light reflex on the doorknob triggers the alert dozen of times day and night. In theory you reduce this effect reducing the ""sensitivity"", but it in minimum, it didn't stop triggering the alert frequently.",1,1,2019-5-1,1,2,0

"Loved this camera and have been a loyal fan of all things Wyze until the company proved to be a double crossing greed machine.  Really, we should have all seen it coming since the founders are offspring of corporate digital America.  They changed the functionality of the camera so it TURNS OFF all recordings and TURNS OFF all notifications for 5 full minutes after you receive a notification.  What does that mean?  Effectively, it means that your camera which once gave you around the clock notifications of movement and/or sound now secures your property a maximum of only 9 seconds every 5 minutes or 3% of the time it used to secure it for.  Not only did they take from us 97% of its usage, but it is given on a schedule of 5 minutes after the previous notification so you have zero control of when it is working.I don't care about the cloud storage because I use the sd card, but I do care about notifications which I don't get anymore.  They are no linked to event records so I can get a notification only every 5 minutes.  In other words, it is useless unless you subscribe to their new pay per camera cloud storage which gives you back what you once had for free.  It doesn't give you anytime more.  It doesn't keep the events in the cloud a year or even a month.  They save it 2 weeks, just like they did yesterday for free before they hijacked the system.  My hands aren't tied.  I already ordered a different brand and these cameras are going in the garbage.",1,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"It is a neat, little camera.Unfortunately, it runs incredibly hot (worryingly so), and the lack of support for wireless connections above 2.4 GHz makes it so that the actual image quality of the camera is irrelevant; the video appears to be of poor quality despite the camera being capable of 1080p.",2,1,2019-7-13,1,2,0

Most importantly, alerts do not upload to the cloud consistently for either camera. Close to 40% of the videos-to-cloud fail and can never be viewed from the alerts menu. I do have an SD card that successfully records all motion (longer than the 10-12 second alert clips). I can view the videos on the local  SD card remotely, but that would not help in the event of a security issue.

"I spent a lot of time checking out various reviews on cams and decided this would be the best cam for my needs. However, when I tried to set up this can, I couldn't get past scanning the QR. I watched videos and even called Support, but never got it to work. (I finally got it to scan one time, but then it wouldn't connect to my wifi. So, I rebooted everything and couldn't get the cam to scan again.) And there is nothing wrong with my phone screen.

I went to Walmart and purchased a Geeni for the same price, and it connected in minutes...and I didn't have to scan a QR. I'm loving my new Geeni cam. Don't take a chance. The Wyze cam is NOT user-friendly and not worth your time and money.",1,1,2020-2-4,1,1,0
"Update: do not buy. I ordered two and one will not turn on while the other camera’s night vision doesn’t work. I filed a complaint a week ago and they only reply every few days. The issue still isn’t resolved. Considering we are using these cameras to keep an eye on our new puppy and they haven’t worked for a week makes them useless.The picture is decent for the price, a little grainy, but this isn’t an expensive camera. Sound is ok. We got it to keep an eye on our new dog and it’s perfect for that purpose. A few times we’ve told her “no” over the audio when she’s chewy something she isn’t supposed to. There a 50% chance it works. Overall it does what we expected for the price.",1,1,2019-1-7,1,2,0
"Written May 5, 2020I think the product is tremendous as far as value. It has a CO2 detector and smoke alarm. It has excellent night vision. The pictures are a very clear 1080P. It has a magnet in the base for easy mounting. It has two way audio. It is an indoor camera, but I have it mounted outdoors in a safe place using the magnet for easy mounting.",2,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"I loved this when i first received one, easy setup, worked exactly as it was supposed to.  I added a few more cameras and little by little, what worked great has become all but useless.  I tried calling customer support, more than once, very pleasant people but zero follow through and empty promises.The bottom line at this point; sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.  It isn't my internet, i have gone through all the trouble shooting regarding that and even paid a bit more to have more upload speed for a bit which improved absolutely nothing.  Most of the day the cameras are offline or they just ""freeze"" while viewing them.",3,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0
"This thing works very well, especially if you install an optional micro SD card for more playback options.  I own two Ring devices and can honestly say that the Wyze app works just as well if not better than my Ring product.  Additionally, the Wyze camera connects to my phone or tablet way faster then either of my Ring devices. I'm actually not happy with the Ring devices compared to Wyze.Add to this, you don't have to pay ANY subscription fee to access your video events in their cloud storage. You get 14 days of recordings for FREE. Also, keeping the recordings locally is not even an option with my Ring devices. With Wyze I am constantly recording all motion or sound detected to the optional micro SD card in the device.",5,1,2019-3-11,1,1,0
"Started using April 13, 2020I really wanted to like this camera but definitely do not. It is just okay. This is definitely not a security camera! It could be a nanny camera, baby monitor perhaps or used to keep an eye on the kids if you are in the next room but not a security camera. It can not make out a license plate numbers from 10 feet away ( I have not tried anything closer). You can barley make out faces from distances beyond 4 feet. Decent face shots are good at 4 feet and closer. The only reason I can make out some faces beyond 4 feet is because I already know who they are like mail carrier or family members. If you were to try and take a snap shot or video of the person taking a package at your doorstep, you would be out of luck on trying to recognize them. It is buggy, it will not capture continuous motion, so if you have one event it catches the 12 seconds but if there is one right after that it will not capture it so there is a delay between events with minutes in-between from my experience. The SD card helps in that regard but there is still a delay. You cant mute it directly from device, incoming and outgoing so if someone wanted to listen to a private conversation they could and who knows who else is listening when it transmits over wi-fi/internet. I wish I had not wasted the $44 ($26 cam + $10 SD card + $8 extension cord) thinking it would be a good alternative to a real security camera, it still would not be good if I had bought it a couple of months earlier at $21. Again at best it is a nanny camera or baby monitor, some kind of toy but it is what it is for $26.  I think my 20 year old digital camera that used floppy disks for storage took better photos. The app also just okay, needs a better way to fast forward or rewind from SD card playback, maybe there is one but I couldn't figure it out.",2,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"Looking at the reviews, most of the people bought the camera because of the low price. The New York Times article by Farhad Manjoo has a good description on how they achieved such as low price.From the time I received the package until I got it set up, I'm really with the minimalist approach they have taken. The tiny camera came in such a compact package and set up was easy. Comparing to what I have to do on my other camera, this is a lot simpler. The video quality is very good for this price.",5,1,2018-1-4,1,2,0
"Two years ago we bought our first home in a really “safe” and family friendly neighborhood. Less than a month later my car was broken into. As a new home owner, we received a lot of solicitations for home security. I chose Vivint. I didn’t do my research and committed and signed a deal with the Devil! There were Many glitches from the beginning. But too late to get out of the contract.  The indoor/outdoor cameras and doorbell camera were very unreliable and the viewing quality was so Horrible! So much so, that I utilized another security company within months to feel safe. However, I only have extra outdoor cameras with the second company. No issues with them whatsoever. Not one! Anyway, Many service calls later with Vivint and 2 years later, I was physically assaulted 3 feet from my indoor Vivint camera that was suppose to record on motion. Sadly, it did NOT! I suffered a shattered bone and required surgery and physical therapy. I felt cheated by Vivint’s protection because I had no recorded proof to provide to the police. They still wouldn’t let me out of my contract even though I felt I had a legitimate reason to be relieved of their contract. Nope! Didn’t happen and I’m counting down the last 16 months I have with them. I pay $80/mo for their service. Well, I found out about Wyze when I saw the cutest video of a father and daughter singing duet. I looked up her other videos and it took me to a short bio about the family and how her dad had this business. I was skeptical how something so affordable could possibly meet my expectations. I still needed a camera without the high cost to have as an extra set of eyes in my home and to place in the same area in my home where I was attacked. I received it and the connection process was sooooo easy and the image and recording quality is superb!! I received my camera on Jan 27, the first use was at bedtime. The night vision photos is so crisp and clear compared to Vivint’s camera. I have them side by side and the photo quality speaks volumes! The other photos were of the next day in the afternoon with and without the lights on. I zoomed in on the photos and you can see the amazing difference between both company cameras.  I was only allowed one video per review but I really wanted to show the major difference in quality. So I didn’t post any. What I can say is that both cameras from 7:30 am, with  only the kitchen light In the room next to living room, Wyze was already recording in color!! Vivint was still recording black and white in night vision :( Another video from this afternoon while I was moving around, Vivint as usual glitched, froze and skipped. Wyze did not :)  It was clear with not one glitch. Wyze kicks ass!  I ordered one cube to try it out and now I am going to order bunches more for myself and as gifts and Just as I’ve told everyone to avoid Vivint, I’m going to tell them about Wyze! Although Vivint offers a live monitoring support to notify 911 and to call me if my alarm is triggered, I do not trust them with my life or the lives of my family and I will utilize my second security system who offers the live support in case of an emergency and that is with my cable company that was only $20 more a month added to my current package. But I know that I can trust Wyze. Their camera will be able to provide the clarity and details if ever necessary. There is no freezing, blurring, skipping and broken up recordings. From me and my family, Thank you so much for such a great camera!",5,1,2019-1-28,1,1,1
"I had it watching my front walkway and it picked up movement just fine.  It was inside my house, behind a window so I couldn't really use it at night.  If the IR lights were left on, all you saw were 4 ""hot spots"" in the picture and you couldn't see anything out the window.  That said, if you are able to place it outside - under cover or inside a weather-resistant housing - it should work fine.  Daylight footage was fine.  In fact, it was better than I had expected from a $25 camera!  The app was fine too; I never had any trouble with it.  Ultimately, I returned it because power was the issue for me.  It needs to be near a power source.  I had a 25' USB power cable but I still can't get that to where I wanted the camera.  Moreover, I'm not fishing 200' of 14/2 into the attic just to power this little camera.  For me, it's easier to fish CAT6 and set up a PoE IP camera.  The only reason I'd purchase this again would be for indoor use.  In my opinion, the only practical application would be to watch the common areas & entry locations in the house and make sure the kids & pets aren't getting into trouble while you're not around.  If you have a tablet or an old phone kicking around that you can leave on for long periods of time, this would make for a pretty good baby monitor.  Or, if you had a babysitter taking care of your kids while you were out, you could use this as a nanny-cam to make sure they're doing what you're paying them to do.",5,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
"Bought this camera as a gift for my 60+ year old parents so they could keep an eye on their place while they're gone. Coworkers recommended these as a great starting point so I bought one to start to make sure it functioned we'll before committing to more.Everything started off great with a super simple setup. Upon getting setup my dad was prompted in the app to update the firmware. With a click of the button he was good to go... nice, right?! Nope! The updated firmware effective killed triggered event recordings, cloud recordings, and sd card recordings. The only thing that seemed to work was the live stream. So, after 3 hours of reformatting the wyze SD card and troubleshooting their network I stumbled across a post on the community board stating the most recent firmware was causing issues for the user that we're similar to mine. So, after another 30 minutes of manually flashing the previous firmware to the camera, everything worked perfectly. I find it disappointing that such an unstable firmware was released and that what seemed like a super easy setup turned into a 4 hour troubleshooting nightmare. I use a much more expensive camera setup from a competitor on my house and was considering switching over since I could add more cameras on the cheap. After this experience I'm not sure that switch will be happening.",3,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
"I really miss my cat when I'm at work, so that is my reason behind this purchase. The set-up was very simple and I love that the camera is so small and is able to stand on its own.

I would not rely on this, but if it fits your budget and you're not expecting super HD quality, then go for it!I own a nest camera, but it killed me to purchase another one for almost $200. I am satisfied with my purchase, and I hope the camera will last me.",4,1,2019-10-26,1,2,1

It stores 1 week for free in the cloud and also has a web page interface as well as an android app to view the live feed and recorded feed.

"Update. All 3 cameras no longer work at all. Always offline. “Restart Device” and “PowerCycle” settings  always FAIL. I could understand if one failed but all three? It’s not the wifi because that is strong. I don’t know how there are so many positive reviews because even when working they were always unstable connection messages. FAIL.I really loved this camera when I got it and one month later purchased 2 more. Really easy to setup and a fairly good picture. No monthly fee while able to save video was the reason I purchased.  About a week later it started to fail repeatedly. It is often offline and then the second cameras started having issues also. I’ve wasted many hours resetting these cameras. Power cycle, restarting them. Completely delete and setup again. They work for the day and then when I check them later on, one or two are offline again. I’ve restarted and powercycled them so many times I have given up. I’ve had so many failure codes.

I haven't recorded anything yet, but the date and time at the bottom right is worthless. Why would anyone want their beautiful image ruined with date and time?????? Who cares? There's metadata with the image or video that tells you the same thing. There's too much BlueStacks crap around the image.  The ""zoom"" feature is worthless. Too close or too far away. The image is nice and clear, but still way, way, way too wide. I don't want to see everything in the world. Why don't they make a camera that gives you a normal view.

"At this price point , this camera is without a doubt a winner. Small , easy to set up and use. It comes with 3m tape to mount to the wall but I used a command strip instead since I know from experience that 3m tape can damage whatever it is placed on. Definitely watch the little video that explains how to set up. I was a little lost when I got to the part where I needed to scan the QR code. I was trying to do so with my phone , when in fact you use the camera to scan the code displayed on your phone. Whoops! I got this so I could keep an eye on my dogs when we leave them inside. Plus who doesn’t love getting alerts about dog daughters running around while at work. I have even used it to catch which one was digging in the trash can. Aha! And you can speak to them through the camera. Imagine her surprise being caught red handed when she knew we were gone.One thing to note the picture quality is great but the sound is sub par at best.

"As you may have noticed, trying to find a webcam right now is next to impossible. Wyze has developed a firmware update to change the Wyze Cam 2 into a webcam. They have directions on their website and there are several Youtube videos that go through the process. I have mine set up and running on a Mac running macOS 10.15.4 working with both FaceTime and Zoom. I'm using an external mic and speaker instead of the ones built into the camera. Set up was straight forward. The only challenge was getting the micro SD card that you need to install the firmware to click into the camera which I figured out once I watched a Youtube video. The other thing is I forgot to purchase a USB A to USB A cable. It's a must have as the included cable will not work for webcam use.

"There's a lot to like about this camera. The picture quality is quite good, the motion capture works pretty well, it's easy to set up and so far it's done its job consistently well. The big shortcoming though is the software interface.First off, the camera can only be accessed through the phone app. There's no web interface or desktop application so every time you want to check the feed, you have to get your phone > open the app > select Home, > click on the image,  then wait for it to authenticate.",3,1,2019-5-6,1,1,0
"The good: small size, which helps in putting it anywhere you want to (we have it in our window looking outside to our front door).  motion detects very well.  The slightest thing makes it go off.  camera is fair.  Not super great always, but that may be becuase of where it is placed...farther away then we want.  However, it will zoom in the app so you can see better, although it can get grainy.Not as good: you need a memory card to really access files if you don't want to pay for the cloud use after two weeks.  Night vision is not the greatest, that being said, we have not done as other reivews suggested so the lights are reflecting off the window to aid in night vision. A couple of times it takes a while after being plugged in to recongnize the camera and the app. occasionally it takes multiple attempts. Other than that we haven't noticed an issue.",2,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"Update:  I have decided this setup is nothing more than an occasional review of actions. It is almost worthless as a security system since it is likely to miss much of the action due to the relatively short recording time of 12 seconds AND the long reset time before it can be activated again. (About 5 minutes). So if someone is breaking into your house, you get a 12 second clip every 5 minutes or so. On top of that, the relatively long time it takes for you to receive a notice of activity will mean, whatever or whoever activated the camera will be long gone by the time you get the notice. All of this could be cured if you were allowed to adjust the settings. I have lowered my rating to 2 stars and not 1 since the video quality is good for what you pay. For real security, I would look elsewhere.The 2 biggest issues I have with this camera is that there is no way to adjust the auto record time when set for motion detection and it does not reset quickly enough after a triggered recording has completed. You get a 12 second recording once triggered which may not allow enough time for the subject to get close enough to recognize, especially if it is triggered by a vehicle pulling to the curb and approaching the house. This would not be as big of an issue if the camera would reset and reactivate as the subject approaches, but the reset time has such a long delay, that by the time it can be reactivated, it is too late to be of any good for that incident. This is a major defect as far as I'm concerned since this is what the system is for. The only option to set to constant record mode which means you will have to manually search through hours of recordings to find what you are looking for if you don't know the exact time. It seems to me this would be a simple fix for an otherwise good camera for the price. How about a setting to continue to record as long as there is motion? The only other thing I would mention is that it needs to be fairly close to the subject or the details will be too small to be of much good in identifying the subject. I guess this is why the Ring doorbell sells so well since it is close to face level, but that is also why so many are snatched off the wall and have to be replaced. There is also that annoying $3 month forever charge too.  I also realized after I purchased that this needed to have access to a power outlet and is not battery powered, but that is my bad. I did go back and see that was stated in the listing, so make sure you have an available outlet or can run a cord to the camera.",2,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0

"What I like about the camera. It's low cost and easy to setup. With the addition of a 32gb men card it can locally store a lot of motion captures and events for review. I had to turn the resolution down because of my crappy DSL upload speeds but that's not the cameras fault.What I don't like. The motion captures are limited to 12second clips Max that I have found so far. Haven't found a way to change this. No way to point the camera to send the video to a local storage like a NAS which I have! and allow the camera to flush it's memory. I have to manually go in and delete the old motion captures. I'm sure at some point the old will be overwritten, I'm guessing when the card fills up, I'm not sure as there really isn't a good explanation of how the camera works. THE CAMERA IS SOLD BY AMAZON AS AN AMAZON RECOMMENDED YET THERE IS NO FIRE TABLET APP! yea that one is really stupid!

"I unboxed this right away and figured I'd try to get it running before dark so I could see the results. It's fairly small and it doesn't have an ""array"" of lights like other competitors do but the night vision worked good. It has a microsd card slot under the base and I put in a 64GB and it worked just fine.For setup I had to download the app and sign up, which I didn't really want to do but I understand it's for the cloud stuff. Once I got the app running and the camera registered I was greeted with the main screen and selected the camera (you can name it whatever you want). It got a firmware update right away. When everything loaded up I was able to see the live feed on my phone. But it was bad, the quality looked lower than 360p on YouTube. And it had severe lag. I would physically move the camera and about 15 seconds later the feed on my phone would update. I tapped on sound and then I was able to hear what the camera was picking up. Quality was ok and it also had lag but it was more reasonable at about 1 second. I tried changing some settings and upped the quality to HD, which cleaned it up some but the lag was about the same. Then the app started freezing and wouldn't update at all, but the audio was still coming through. It was just stuck, so I force closed the app and started it again. Same results, the app would just freeze. I gave it some patience and tried some basic stuff, rebooting my phone, the camera, and the app. No dice.",3,1,2019-5-19,1,0,0
"I use this camera only insides, as it is not rated for exterior use.  It records in very high quality 1080 resolution.  It picks up on motion to record our cats strolling down the hallway outside the bathroom door where the camera is placed.  No, I'm not a pervert -- the camera is in the bathroom because one of our two cats decided it was fun to pee on the bathroom floor instead of the litter box just outside the door.  We couldn't catch her in the act, so I set up this Wyze camera and caught the calico in the act the first night.  I have put the camera in two different locations, and in both, the camera has trouble staying in connection to the wifi router, which is really quite close.  Since I'm not using it as a security camera, but more to watch the cats' nighttime behavior, lack of wifi is not a problem.  I can get what I need by pulling the SD card and plugging it into my computer.  If you need the wifi connection, be sure you have a location with minimal obstruction between your router and the camera.  Other than that, it is hard to believe how good the quality of the video is and how sensitive the motion detection is.  This is a truly great camera within its wifi limits.",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0

I had already been using iSmartAlarm Spot cameras for a couple years and was pretty happy with them.Eventually one of my Spots died randomly, and because it was just beyond the warranty period, iSmartAlarm wouldn’t replace it. They did offer to sell me a new one at 50% off, but even at that cost it was still twice as much as Wyze Cam. Combine that with a lesser video/picture quality and a sketchy app, it was time to give Wyze Cam a shot. And man am I glad I did!",5,1,2019-1-13,1,1,0
"Ok, I  bought this because someone is continuously letting their dog dog its business on my side yard and I wanted to see who it is.  I put this in the window on that side of my house. This happens every day (or night).  Looking at the live stream through my phone, the quality is really good.  However, the motion detection doesn't work at all.  I walked past the window that I have the camera set up several times trying to prompt it, even waving my hands and jumping up and down like a fool, but it did not detect anything.  The next morning when I tried to view the SD cards just in case it picked up any motion late at night or early morning, when I believe this is taking place, all I get is a bunch of oriental letters, absolutely no video.  So, I tried to format the disk (that came with the product) and get a message that it is ""write protected"" so it cannot be formatted.  If I use the record feature thru the app, it records and saves it to my photos, but if I could catch the person doing this to record them, then I really don't need this camera.  This is a terrible purchase for what my needs are.  If you buy it to just check in on your baby or your dog, it's good.  But it is definitely not good for security, as the motion detection does not work.  You would have to catch the person yourself and hit record on the app.  It's frustrating because the reviews were what lead me to buy this POS.  It is definitely going back.  This is the second (and last) Wyze product I purchased and both have been crap.  So, if you're buying this to just check in on your house or baby through the app, it works.

"If you choose to use as a camera indoors it works good  as intended purpose but picture quality is decent could be better. The video quality is solely based on internet capabilities and if it's slow image quality drops the slower internet is and then video is less then ideal. Supposedly theres a huge update coming up on the 23rd of june this year to fix alot of issues and a outdoors version. The night vision is good in a close range of about 20 ft or less further than that images are grainy but good enough. Motion detection is good but if you face camera outwards towards the outside of house through window, the ir lights must be turned off to reduce the bounce back of light into camera. You can mount camera outside but must be in a case and have a long enough cord to reach an outlet. Also you can control the sensitivity of the motion sensing and noise sensitivity sensors which is nice. Also spend the extra money on what they call Complete motion capture for $1.49 I think it is. It does help but must be used with a sd card. Get a 64 or higher sd card and takes only a micro sd card. Also there is no PC software version of the feedback. Firmware updates are few to not updated frequently enough for this camera or the pan. Company does more updates for wyze band and the scale more than the cameras. So if your looking for a camera company that keeps up to date and does FREQUENT updates for their cameras and firmware updates and everything monthly go elsewhere. Customer service is less than par and if you buy through their website good luck because it's a nightmare.

"I used it for the outside perimeters of my house. I didn't like that it is not picking up the movements that  i thought it should. It picks up tons of bugs flying by and spider webs swinging on it. But the human detection is not working at its greatest. Also it takes too long to record new events. I believe it is 5 minutes per event.  I think it is supposed to record new activity between the 5 minutes but it hasn't done that on my device.  I have walked and done plenty movement in front of my device in less than 5 minutes and it didn't show me in my event log.  However,  if you have the sd card in it, it does continuously records. The bad part is that you would have to watch the video all day to see if anything happened that thre camera didn't detect. It does have wonderful picture quality during the day which is in color and the night vision appears to look fairly clear. However,  i have flood lights that stay on all night so that assist with being able to see clearly.  Not sure if it really clear without the flood lights on.  Even with all the not so attractive features the size and price are still great.

"If you need real security look elsewhere. It is a great option if you’re using inside house like a nanny cam or for pets. It’s a very awesome and capable camera with a decent app, not to mention the great price. BUT ITS NOT RELIABLE. The cam will randomly not connect and you will need to power cycle it to work again. I really wish it was more reliable. P,s I own 4.",2,1,2018-2-23,1,7,1
High quality video when it works which is almost never. The camera was less than 10 feet from the WiFi router which I confirmed had a fast and reliable internet connection. It would only stay connected for a few seconds at a time. I couldn’t even review video stored on micro sd since the camera didn’t seem to record anything to the card when it wasn’t connected to the internet. There’s a reason these cameras are so cheap.,1,1,2019-7-11,1,4,0

"These are great little cameras.  I recently killed 3 cameras because I tried to update the software via the phone app that you use to view the cameras.  They are great at everything they say they will do, but the minute I tried to update the software on the cameras (prompted by the phone app), they no longer worked.BUT WYZE was kind enough to replace those 3 cameras because they were in warranty (1-year).  The new software will allow the camera to alert for PEOPLE only (as opposed to every little thing that get's in it's path, like tree branches or animals).  I'd love that feature as I use these in an office building where we have people vandalize the common areas, they work great...just can't update them.

"After Reading all the positive reviews about this so-called awesome video security camera I thought I would give it a try. I’ll say I am very very very disappointed in the quality. It’s as if you were looking through a cloudy window. Tried many different lighting scenarios, night vision, daytime, etc. and it’s just fuzzy and hard to make things out. I would say the definition on this is probably less than 720 and at night even with lights it’s pretty worthless. I have a $35 Apeman indoor camera that is crystal clear Compared to this camera. I was hoping it would be good enough to buy three or four of them for outside surveillance but they don’t even work that good inside so I doubt that outside would be any better and the fact that these were made for indoors and not for outdoors and still work this poorly is disturbing. I Did hours and hours of research and thought this could be a good system but it was not to be. I read reviews where people claim that they got rid of high dollar camera systems like Arlo pro two and blink XT two and nest to buy these Wyze cams to replace replace them for a budget because they were supposedly such great cameras but I would question the validity of those claims. Maybe I just got a hold of a bad camera but I’ll never know because I’m not dumping any more money into this disaster of a camera. So sad to use this terminology, but sometimes and more often than not, You get what you pay for.",1,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
This is a bit of a warning to anyone considering buying into the Wyze Cam ecosystem. I have been an avid supporter/watcher of Wyze products for over a year and have 5 Wyze cams currently.I just recently noticed though that 2 of my cameras have begun to malfunction when pointed near any bright light. They have a very obvious hardware flaw and unfortunately as the 2 cameras that have started doing this are just over a year old they will not replace them as they are out of warranty.,2,1,2020-1-28,1,0,1

It’s not wanting to connect to HD or SD Anymore only the lowest 360p ????WHYAnd sometimes looking at memory card gives issues where there’s no footage on it and blank spots too. Still needs work.

"Update: the camera now operates by Alexa voice command on Alexa Spot. Thanks Wyze for fixing, and as promised I have changed my review to four stars. Good camera at a good price for the intended purpose of seeing who is at the front door without going there.Previous: I purchased this Wyze Cam v2 solely based on the advertised feature of working with Alexa (""Alexa, show me the front door camera""). As of February 28, 2019, it does not work as promised. I have many other cameras, and have had them successfully networked for years, but because they are too old to integrate with Alexa/Echo I purchased this camera for that sole purposes. I have the Wyze camera successfully attached to my router, loaded the Wyze App, and enabled the Wyze skill on my Alexa app, and can stream the camera video feed just fine from both my iPhone and Amazon Fire. But upon executing the verbal Alexa command from my Echo Spot the screen shows ""Waiting for Wyze Camera"" and then after about 30 seconds says, ""Hmm. The camera is not responding."" If Wyze engineers are reviewing this, the firmware is the most up to date, Version 4.9.4.28. I will be happy to amend this negative review if a fix is deployed, but so far this is a dud in terms of ability to work with Alexa.",4,1,2019-2-28,1,1,0

"This little inexpensive cube of a camera is literally unbelievable. Like, I still cant wrap my head that a security camera can be this easy to set up, have all the features that my $200 ring camera offers, doesnt charge you to store footage and has excellent visual quality & sound quality with pretty sensitive motion sensors.My son got a bearded dragon for Xmas and we found out that he gets shy to eat in front of us. We were worried that he wasnt eating or drinking so my kid suggested we get a camera to watch him. I actually thought that was a pretty cute idea, we can  enjoy watching what he was doing in there, it would entertain my 5 year old. So I actually just stumbled on this camera by complete accident in a FB forum on Bearded dragons. Someone else had the crazy idea to watch their dragon and suggested this camera. So I went to Amazon and saw the crazy amount of good reviews and obviously the price was so cheap I didnt think twice and just ordered. Set up was a breeze, we had it up and running within minutes. Once we played around with angles and the settings we had a perfect Reptile Watch party happening and my son was thrilled. We actually got to see that our BD was eating and active!  I was literally so blown away by these cameras that i am ordering more for the house. They really are that good. I figured I better stock up now before the company realizes they are selling these amazing cameras too cheap and then jacks up the price lol. So my advice is just BUY IT NOW! Dont wait or hesitate, its worth it for sure.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,1
Bought this so that I had a camera to watch my kids go into Rooms they were not supposed to. Needed motion detection and recording with notifications. The quality is much better than my Vivint $3k system cameras. I would rather have 4 of these for 100.00 total than 3k of crap that disconnects every day and has to be manually restarted. Audio picks up everything so be aware back ground noise can be heard. They are super easy to connect to the WiFi and have not had a problem disconnecting at all. I bought 2 of them and one is outside in a covered area. Even in below 0° temps it still kept going! Also it holds serveral videos before deleting. Most all the other cameras i seen you had to purchase a subscription. Night camera is very detailed as well. In the summer i am going to see about setting one outside for a trail cam if i can find a way to protect it. I waited to write this to make a real review. Will be buying more!!,5,1,2019-2-6,1,1,0
"Was really happy with this camera, amazing camera for the price. Then one day I was prompted to do a firmware update, while updating it it said error, then never worked again. Yellow light comes on but does nothing. I went on the Waze website looking for help, read a way to fix it, which to me involves too many technical steps, one should not need to go through this to fix their camera. However I tried it several times but nothing, same result. I've emailed Waze twice and have not received a response. I can't believe a company like this that preaches community support does not support at all, you have to do your own research. Great companies offer support all the time, they offer a live person you can talk to on the phone, this company does not. It's now two weeks and my Waze cam is just sitting in the corner not working and I can't return it  but I've had it for a couple months now. I'll go back to spending two and three times the price for brand name cameras because they come will full customer support and not the headache.

"I was so completely disappointed. The camera had so much potential. Setup out of the box was easy but getting the camera to see the QR code thing was frustrating as I had to move the screen back and forth, twist and tilt, until it finally “saw” it.  Picture quality is very good and I was surprised such a low priced camera  could provide such high quality video. But then it all became clear. The camera constantly would fall off my network. "" Failed to connect"" That was the most common result any time I wanted to view my camera. The camera frequently disconnected and required power cycles in order to get them to work. They may work for a few hours or a day if I am lucky. Also alarm notifications are not coming up until I open the app making the alerts almost worthless.

"I have had a number of wireless security camera systems over the years. Most are just OK and require some serious effort to set up and operate. I wanted some cameras for inside our vacation home and didn't want to upgrade my existing system. Saw the reviews on these and decided to give them a try for the price. Ordered three stationary and one Pan/Zoom. Set up was super easy after getting a good internet connection and the quality of the pictures is more than expected at this price point. Had them up for 2 weeks now and everything is working fine. Night vision is reasonable as long as you're not looking too far away. Motion sensing seems to be OK, with only a few false alarms. Images are generally good, sharp at 1080 and with good color balance with natural light. Pan/Zoom camera works well and can be set up to automatically pan or you can do it manually. They are quick and quiet too.Wyze offers unlimited cloud storage at $1.49/month per camera. Certainly can add up with a lot of cameras, but offers protection should someone break in an steal the cameras along with their SD cards. At least you'll have the motion capture images of the thieves in the cloud.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0

"I was looking for a home security solution but didn't want to spend 100$ on a camera. This tiny camera is literally everything I wanted and more in a camera.

Much to my surprise this camera is accessible on my phone, and with a data card in it I can review the video without having to put it on my PC. The addition of nightvision and motion alerts was pretty awesome. I don't know how they can offer 2 week cloud storage for alerts for free, but they have definitely changed the market with this camera.The only negatives I have are first that I can't view an alert and then go right to that footage on the camera if I want to watch more than 12 seconds. Secondly the audio quality is pretty low, I can't easily make out what people are saying. Third, that I cannot access my camera feeds from the PC or a web application, this seems like a pretty simple thing I wish their team would implement.",5,1,2018-6-28,1,1,0

Their website is so poorly executed and buggy that it is hard to believe they are spending any of their revenue on such an important feature.

"This little guy is amazing for the price!! It notifies me automatically on my phone when it detects motion & sound. You can set the notifications to just alert/record for either  just motion or just sound, or both. You can also set the times you want it to notify you, so I set mine for the hours I’m at work so it doesn’t notify me all evening when I’m home and happen to pass the camera, lol. It is intended as an indoor camera that requires to be plugged in (as it states in description) and you must set it to run off your wi-fi’s 2.4 g setting (it doesn’t run off 5 g... and it states this in the description!) It was only $19. which I found to be amazing as I simply wanted something that would record what my dog does when she’s home alone. Since I wasn’t looking for high end technology to film a blockbuster movie, I didn’t expect much for $20, but was very pleasantly surprised at what you get from this camera. I loaded a micro SD card to use the record option, but have only used record once because 99% of the time I just watch the live stream instead. The live stream has a little delay in it’s initial detection (maybe 10-20 seconds?) but is faster once you are watching the live feed (meaning the delay seems to be in the notification, not the camera’s streaming) I love that I can talk to my dog through the camera even though I’m at work miles away!I’m including a pic of the live stream. I have it on a table near my front window where my dog typically sits while we’re out. It impressively also does night vision viewing/recording in the dark. I hope this brand comes out with an equally reasonably priced 5g compatible camera as I would definitely buy one. They are a startup company and I am impressed so far!",5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,1
"Good overall value/product, but man the bugs these thing have are insane and seem to have the worst timing. When they want to work, they're great! However be aware that these little guys love to disconnect from your wifi, disable random features (like motion detection), and/or just flat out stop working at no particular time other than when you seem to need them the most. I can't tell you how many times I've played back video only to discover the camera decided to stop recording when what I was looking for occured. Also, the device doesn't directly save to it's sd (I'm sure there's a technical word for this); i.e. I was watching a live stream from one of my cameras when I observed something I wanted to save/record to my phone. So I used the playback feature and started to record, and a couple seconds in, the video skips two seconds ahead and I miss what I needed to record!!! What kind of crap is that!?! It was perfect live. So what are you guys doing, sending the video to your cloud first before allowing the onboard memory to serve its purpose? Or is the software so poorly written that the majority or the features are just broken i.e. continuous loop record.

"This camera had continual connectivity issues and I got 'error code 27' over an over again.  I had updated the camera's firmware and my router and the camera even showed that the wifi strength was at 96% as it was even in the same room as the router.  But even after power cycling, closing/reopening app, using a 'low traffic' wifi channel, lowering the resolution to the minimum and even forgetting/reconnecting the device multiple times - it wouldn't work for more than a few seconds before disconnecting.  After looking through multiple reviews and forums I found that a couple of people got it to work when they added a high quality 32 gb micro sd card.  But at that point I decided to return the product as it didn't deliver on what was promised.  This apparently has been a problem with many customers since it came out and none of the firmware updates have fixed it.  Who knows, maybe it will work for you.  I took that gamble and ended up on the losing side.",1,1,2019-2-6,1,3,0
"I bought this after reading up on this device's ability to be viewed with other Wyze cams at the same time -- without toggling open the camera view, and then closing it on the app before viewing another cam in a different location of the house.  In other words, on my Iphone screen and/or Ipad screen I want to see side by side ""tiles"" of what is going on simultaneously in more than one location.  According to the Wyze community, one supposedly is able to do that by creating a ""group"" of Wyze devices by clicking on the three dots on the home screen.  Guess what.  One cannot do that as there is no ""three dots"" on the home screen of the Wyze App, at least for Apple devices.  So whenever I wish to quickly monitor what is going on in more than one location of my property I must go through the tedious process of opening Cam #1, then closing Cam #1, then opening Cam # 2, then closing Cam # 2, etc.  My app is up to date with the latest version, and all firmware is upgraded.  I give Wyze two stars because it lacks this important feature of being able to view more than one camera at a time.",2,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"UPDATE: For unknown reasons, the settings on the app will change themselves. It will set a time range for recording events, so event recording will be turned off. I've had events disappear without me deleting them.  Again, for the price, they are neat little cameras. But I wouldn't rely on them as a reliable security system.I bought this more for fun than for security, thankfully.  But I've had it about a week and I notice it misses a lot.  We have it set up through a window recording our front walk and driveway.  It will catch cars coming and going, but will miss someone walking right in front of the camera.  Like when my hubby leaves for work, it doesn't always catch him walking directly in front of the camera to get to his car but it will record an ""event"" when he backs up to leave.  We've tried turning up the sensitivity but then we get every bird and bunny that flitters by.  It also doesn't record what it shows on the screen.  For example, I got a package delivered and it recorded the event of the car driving in and I got notification while the car was still there.  So, I hit the ""record"" button hoping to catch video of the driver but when I reviewed what was recorded, it was only 4 seconds of the car backing up. I never saw the driver walk past the camera, either coming or leaving.  Some of that may be our ISP as we don't have the fastest internet because we live in the sticks but I might try an SD card.  Although, I don't know if you get notification if it is continuously recording on the card.  It still has a pretty decent picture, especially for the price.  I am still thinking of getting a couple more for around the house.",3,1,2019-5-8,1,0,0

Or if you wanted it as a nanny cam you will only see 12 seconds at a time. I've tried everything but the playback function does not work. It always says playback for this time not available which it says for any time you select.

In my experience where the trouble comes in is the app; it's flaky. It will randomly forget to send you push notifications upon detecting movement. One day it's working fine; the next day I don't receive a single event push notification and then when I open the app to investigate the push notification is off; or, events are off altogether. What? I had them set to on last time I logged in. Frustrating! Restarting the camera from the app has helped but I shouldn't have to do this every couple of days.",3,1,2019-4-3,1,2,0

Anyway it took a couple of days but using the motion sense recording I was able to figure out it's my oldest cat, now I've got to figure out where the next place I should put the camera. It's very impressive for the price it can do a lot but I've also never had a camera before so I can't compare. My favorite features would be the Auto-Night Mode and the motion sense recording the only thing I wish I could is the amount of time that is recorded for motion sense.

"I ordered two of these for our new home. We are between two states right now, selling one property to move into the other home. I thought these would be great for watching what was going on around the new home. They were very simple to install and the picture was quite decent. They worked great...for a couple of weeks. Then we went back to the new house. Before we left, I wanted to make sure the cameras were working properly. One of them came up just fine, but the other one would not. I powered it down and started over multiple times, but to no avail. So I called customer support. After waiting on the phone for about 30 minutes, the message came in saying no one was available and simply hung up on me. 30 minutes?  Seriously?  Get some phone prompts or something. That ploy does nothing but aggregate people. So, I went to the support page listed in the instructions. Well, the website has moved. I went there and tried to log in with the exact same ID and password as when I set up the camera, but it said my ID did not exist. I tried setting up a new one, that didn’t work either. So net, net my result right now is the camera worked for approximately 2 weeks and I can’t get to anyone to find out if I should return it or there is something more I can do to fix it. I’m hoping the first one continues to work well. It was the perfect solution for us!  I like the fact it is just a camera and you don’t have to pay a monthly subscription fee.

Excellent camera for the money! I have yet to experience any issues with the camera other than the camera recording an event when it switches to night time mode(or reverse).

"I LOVE these cameras! I've had different security cameras of all sorts for the last 10 years. Hardwired, wireless, wire free, I've tried them all. This little beast is my favorite, by far. I had spent over 1k on wire free cameras from that super big brand, thinking they would be the best, they must be for that price. No. Just no. It took over 20 secs to view a camera. It doesn't sound like a lot, but that is more than enough time for someone to notice, locate and disable a camera. These cameras took almost no effort to set up (Omg, why doesn't every brand have you scan a code with the camera, so simple) and take an average of 3 seconds to load a live feed. The 2 way audio works well and has very little delay. I find the clarity to be more than acceptable. Night vision is good, though my needs do not require long distances, so I cannot comment on how far the night vision will go. I also cannot speak on facial recognition (currently using in my chicken coop), but motion detection is on point. It follows multiple chickens throughout the field of view with ease. But, my absolute favorite thing so far is this... This tiny, little, INDOOR camera survived a full on Colorado blizzard while mounted under my coop. It was hit with snow from all directions except above, and endured 50+ mph winds and sub zero temps. Lastly, the range of wifi on these is also highly impressive. I have several wifi cameras that cost a couple hundred dollars, and the Wyze cameras work waaaaaay better. Currently, I have 2 cameras (6 more on the way!) located nearly 100ft from my nearest wifi point, and through 3 walls, and they still work great. All in all, I am so impressed, I've actually decided to replace my entire system of cameras with Wyze cams. Well done, Wyze. Well done.",5,1,2019-4-12,1,0,0

These cameras use “computer vision” which means they are constantly running an image processing algorithm to detect changes within its field of view. For some perspective, this means you can put this camera in front of a television and it will “detect motion” even though there is nothing physically moving in front of it. Compare this with Arlo or Blink cameras that use a physical motion detector sensor (I think PIR usually but recently devices have been utilizing tiny radar modules) which would not go off from such a silly example setup. Now, that’s not necessarily a bad thing because this permits the WYZE cameras to be mounted behind glass (eg inside your house/apt looking out) with the caveat that the IR light will need to be deactivated. This however may also result in many false alarm triggers at night if you have glare from things like headlights that appear to move from the perspective of a CV device. For example, if I leave my car parked in the field of view of this WYZE cam and cars drive past my house at night, the headlight glare off my windshield will trigger this device.You are able to get 2-3 days of continuous HD video storage for a one time fee of ~$7 (the cost of an appropriate 32GB micro SD card) or reduce the quality to standard def and increase storage days to something like 6-7, which is unbeatable as far as I’ve seen elsewhere. The camera streams the video back to your WiFi from the card so you are able to remotely view the continuous recorded video from anywhere. Again this is what other companies like Arlo and Nest charge you $10-$15 PER MONTH to do and for the ~$35 it cost to buy a WYZE and an SD card is exactly why I’m supplementing my Arlo system with it. The delay from opening app to viewing live stream is minimal and probably the shortest I’ve seen from Arlo, Blink, or Funlux. You can select activity zones which works fairly well but not perfect. (Example: if I select my walkway as the zone, it will detect motion but since it’s only detecting my feet, for some reason won’t send me a detection alert. If I raise the height of the box, it gets more of me and sends an alert.)  I still have more testing to do with it. The mount and swivel that’s built in, with included metal plate and VHB tape, is a convenient feature that I appreciate. Other notable features are the smoke alarm detection which I’ve tested and was satisfied with, the timelapse ability! which I absolutely love, and the IFTTT compatibility. Altogether I think this is a great device at an unbeatable value but due to the particular technology used its not a 100% solution FOR ME but could be for others.

"1st of all, if you want any help or something isn’t working their costumer service will never get back to you and if they do, it’ll be a long time because I’ve send multiple emails and no reply’s.But luckily, I have been persistent in getting this thing to work the way I want so I’ve read countless blogs and Reddit’s and FINALLY! Not the best picture quality but not bad at all. Sends you notifications and records a 15 minute clip. You do need to buy a mini SIM card unless you want to pay for cloud (which I never figured out how to do). I wasn’t getting notifications or able to see any playback for days which was driving me crazy but instead of returning it, I decided to buy a new SIM card and it finally started working. My SIM card works just fine in my GoPro but for some reason this camera didn’t like it (it never told me though, it took me days of trial and error and hope to figure this out). But overall, for less than $30, it’s great!",5,1,2018-11-13,1,1,0
"I bought this to replace another one I purchased which had issues with night mode.  This camera is very good, I have this in a spare bedroom looking out a window which faces the front of my house.  The picture is very good and the app has a lot of features.  The one I like and why I bought this camera is I can turn night mode off.  When night mode is on the lights for night vision mode IR Lights would cause a glare and I could not see anything.  With it off there is no glare and I can still see.Installation was a little tricky, as I had a hard time getting the camera to scan the QR Code in order to complete the install.

"After reading all the positive reviews on here and CNet I was excited to get an inexpensive cam that had a micro SD card slot and I didn't need to purchase online storage at some point. Soet, expecting a very easy setup, I unpacked the camera and was instantly frustrated because it wouldn't connect to our router. Finally called Wyze and was walked through setup, with steps that were not on the instructions. Success! Then we put in the SD card and.....fail! I was told they'd send me instructions to my email address to correct the problem. They did, but not something that I could follow. It was basically reprogramming the camera to an older version of the product. I wrote to them to tell them it didn't work and the support person was not helpful at all. After several attempts to get someone to help me (they wouldn't call me) I gave up and am using it right now without an SD card. Eventually I will get back in touch with a phone call and try to get the issue resolved but due to lack of time in my schedule at this point, it will just have to wait. Almost sent it back but didn't have the energy to do that either. Very disappointed!",3,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0

Sadly my family had issues with their camera this year, which we were able to resolve after days of trouble shooting.  Then two weeks ago one of my crapped out.  No luck trouble shooting and Wyze Customer Support advised I was out side of the 1 year warranty.

"We purchased these to replace 2 WEMO cameras that were losing their service as the end of June.  We saw a review of the Wyze cams that was extremely positive and, at their low price, we decided to try one.  We were so impressed we went back for 2 more.SETUP - One of the easiest I've done.  Download the app, plug in the camera, push the setup button, follow instructions on the app.  Instructions are easy to follow - only recommendation I have is to go ahead and download the app first and run it.  It then walks you through the setup as shown on the instructions.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
3rd time writing this is the charm. Bought 3 Wyze V2 cameras and they are not stable. Wifi has been changed to match all the Wyze community suggestions and the cameras still go offline randomly and require a power cycle.  The offline code (90) is present when the camera goes offline and the LED on the camera is blinking blue.  Wifi signal is always 85% or higher and does not have a lot of interference around. Wifi channel is set to fixed channel and no other Wifi devices have any issues.  Resetting the router does not bring the camera back online only power cycling the camera does. Other issues are cloudy to sunny sets off motion detected and sometimes shows person detected. Tried setting motion off and only person events but did not change a thing. Also had tried the sensitivity and have not had good luck.  On a positive the cameras are easy to setup and have a great picture quality. If they were reliable to detect motion and stay online these would be great. Android app needs a little more work and a few features added like video fast playback.  Bottom line I would do a little research and maybe try one to see if it works for your system. I bought 3 and am not sure I would buy again.  Some others recommend putting the camera power on a smart plug so you can remotely power cycle the camera. I would think Wyze could add a firmware watchdog to do this in the camera.,2,1,2019-8-16,1,0,0
"Okay, I own 14 Wyze Cams (11 Version 2, and 3 ""Pan"" Cams). I also own 1 Nest Cam. All 15 cameras are all situated up at my empty vacation home. They are all on the same Wi-Fi network (with some of the Wyze Cams connected through a 2nd wi-fi router that I setup as an access point for wider coverage on the property). I am a network technician, so I understand bandwidth, channels, signal strength, and connection issues.First point - the Nest Camera (indoor unit) has worked flawlessly since the day it was installed. It's like the ""Momma Dog"" of my ""pack"" of cameras. It works exactly as it should. Nest has built a very stable platform and the software and firmware appears to be both robust and mature.

"When Wyze says the camera is ""full HD"" they mean that the resolution is 1920×1080. The picture quality is somewhere between 360 and 720. When I got my first camera I opened up a ticket with support, they said 'oh, there's something wrong with your camera, let us send you a new one' and proceeded to send another one that produced images of barely any difference. When I reopened the ticket I got bounced around and was basically told ""well if you don't like the quality that's on you"" before I pointed out what happened initially and they send me a third camera of still questionable image quality. Look at their website, they have a slider thing that compares 1080 vs 720, now look at those comparisons vs. the majority of the snapshots and videos posted by users of the cam. False advertising at its worst.The form factor and price is great, but what's the point of of a security camera if it can't be used to properly identify somewhere.

For the money, it's pretty remarkable, actually.  Considering getting a few more, for hunting cabin, etc.My one complaint is - every time you access the camera with the app, it has to ""re-authenticate"", or something like that.  So there is a delay of several seconds while it does that.  You can't just open the app and immediately see what the camera sees.  That little delay *could* be critical in some circumstances.

"I had recently returned TWO different security systems including a +$200 Arlo system so I was skeptical about the Wyze cameras. They are indoor only and do not pan/scan, but they are SUPER QUICK AND EASY to set up. They do not require a seperate signal sender or connection to the router, and I had pictures/videos in minutes. My previous woes was that cameras would not capture motion, nor send reports/notifications to my email. But the Wyze system did both in just minutes. Very reliable. And when I received too many notification alerts (birds, squirrels, motion lights) I was able to fine-tune the sensitivity and even set detection zones to limit artifact that triggers alerts. I am quite happy with the product and the price.They are not weather proof so I have the cameras in windows facing my gate and garage. The night mode sensors create glare in the glass so much after-dark images are sub par, but overall am very happy with this product.",5,1,2019-1-5,1,1,0
"This camera is very easy to setup and the quality of the image is good enough for the price, however there is one missing feature which I consider an absolute deal-breaker: you can't set the motion detection schedule by day of week or by weekday vs. weekend. You can only set it by time of day.This is a very, very basic feature offered by many other home security camera apps and the user community has been requesting it from Waze for years, but they cannot figure out how to implement it for whatever reason. The have added a 'Shortcut' feature which will allow you to turn Motion Detection on & off by pushing a button on the app, but this still requires manual intervention. The point of scheduling is to activate camera features without the owner having to remember to do it themselves every day/week/etc.",2,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
"Great camera especially for the price. App needs a bit of work. My complaints are:*Notifications can't be muted for a timed duration, it's either on or off.

"The first proviso is that I am using this camera mounted inside and shooting through a window pointing outside to a front yard and busyish street. Regardless, the camera comes with a comedically short cable, something like 6 ft long, meaning given the usual height of a floorboard outlet, you'll barely be able to place this camera at eyeheight or above and only immediately above the outlet. Of course any deviation from straight above the outlet means less height and ultimately less coverage.  At best the cable is meant for setup alone and at worst it completely hobbles the camera altogether. I just happen to have an outlet in a slightly exceptable place but otherwise I have very few installation options without buying a much longer cable which I have not done.Despite the ability to setup a detection zone, triggering events do not include a person only detection event. Only motion (any motion) or sound are included, therefore if the camera is pointed out into the world, many many many motion events and recordings will be made. This renders the events and associated recordings relatively meaningless and of no security alert value. I understand the Cam is intended for indoor use, but as often as not people are deploying these outside as a cost effective alternative. However, in my experience unless the camera can be mounted in such a way as to exclude any extraneous movement events, you'll be dealing with a lot of unwanted clips and notifications. And of course such a mounting scheme presumably high and looking down is impossible with just the provided cable unless you've got an outlet exactly 6 feet away.",2,1,2020-7-16,1,1,0
"For the money and ease of use, you can't really beat it, but don't rely on the push notifications...I bought one to watch our gas pumps at work since we keep them unlocked. I got a call last night that the alarm at my boss' house was going off and I pulled the camera up on the Wyze App before heading to see if the gas pump camera caught them coming or going. I have person detection on with push notifications and have thoroughly tested it with perfect detection when using the pumps. I had no push notifications, but caught my boss' grandson standing at the pump in plain view filling his daughter's four-wheeler up with gas. All-in-all, a false alarm thankfully, but had it been a legit theft, I would never have caught it without going back and reviewing the footage in the app. The Events section in the app even showed it as a person detected.So just keep that in consideration when using these cameras...for general purpose recording, the quality is great and it's very easy to setup and adjust. The IR (night vision) leaves a lot to be desired though. I'd probably just opt to use it in a well-lit area unless you're recording subjects who will be within just a few feet of the camera.",3,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0

"Pros: They are pretty cool - when they work.  One of mine happened to work when our postman threw a Christmas package into our turtle tank, ruining them.  I was able to use the footage to get the package replaced.  Ironically, the package thrown in the water was another set of these Wyze cameras that I purchased for my parents.  Customer service is incredible.  They 100% work with you and are nice about it.  They replaced the water-drenched cameras without issue, and quickly.  I was really impressed.Cons: The cameras only capture 12 seconds of footage.  If the footage you really need happens 12 seconds after the initial motion is detected, you will not capture the footage.  Additionally, the cameras often miss hours of time.  We have a neighbor that lets their dog do its business in our yard.  We are hoping to capture proof of who is doing it so we can confront them about it.  For over a month, the dog has been dropping its business, but the camera never catches it.  The other day, I walked to where the dog feces was and pointed to it so I could go back and see if the camera is capturing that area.  When I came back to look, there was no footage on the camera, and there was a large block of time without footage.  I checked the connection and the cameras were connected, so I am not sure why it didn't capture any footage for a few hours.  Also, one of my cameras has recently stopped connecting to the network.  The camera and tech support claim there is a network issue, but the other camera I own IS connected to the network, so that cannot be right.  The two cameras I bought my parents for Christmas are also failing to connect to their network.  Their network works fine with everything else they own, so we are all at a loss.",3,1,2019-1-5,1,1,0

Also the microphone is sub par when you are trying to talk to someone through it. My father who is mostly deaf cannot hear me through it, and other family members say I sound like a robot from an old 1950s sci-fi movie coming through it.

"I have two Wyze Cameras, one facing inside and one facing outside, and I'm very happy with how well they work. For the price (around $20 before tax and shipping), they really provide a great value. I have friends who use more expensive smart home cameras, and some of those have better apps and image quality, but they cost hundreds more.The image quality on these cameras is great for what I need. I have a small home with one main entrance, and this Wyze camera has a wide enough angle that I can see the front door and important windows all in one frame. The motion and sound detection alerts are very accurate, it always notifies me when it sees or hears something. For the price, the image quality is great. I have one facing outside, and it's a bit hard to read license plates (From about 30 feet away from the camera), but it is looking through a window, so I don't blame the camera. On that note, the night vision does not work through glass, so if you want to monitor outside your home at night, you have to put the camera outside, or keep your flood light on (this is true for all infrared night vision cameras, it's not Wyze's fault so I didn't take any stars off for this).",5,1,2019-3-28,1,0,0
"We got this camera about a month ago because it was inexpensive to monitor our pets after we began having issues with one of them misbehaving while we slept. Several times a day I get a fragment error which means it doesn't record the clip, and I have missed footage I had both been waiting on, and needed to see. That alone is a huge nuisance. It also crashes at least once a week and stops recording motion, but can still be accessed for live viewing, which means I have to wait until I'm home later that day and un-plug it for a few minutes. My playback feature hasn't worked since day one, and the app platform is limited and frustrating, which is made worse by the fact that there's no desktop option. If I hadn't signed up for cam plus this would have gone back 2 weeks ago, but for $25 it works as well as you could expect.

"I was super skeptical about this device until my coworker told me he had great luck with it. Everything it says it can do, it does. It's a simple camera that uses an SD card. That's it. You can access it from anywhere, and record events if you want. Just make sure whoever you give access to, you set some boundaries. Some people like to ""check"" on you. I would say the voices are a little hard to hear, but I don't like talking much on them anyway. I did have to adjust the notification settings because it would let you know about every sound and movement otherwise. That's better for when you vacay. The magnetic bottoms make for easy install. The cable is long, but visible. I tried put it in places where the wire isn't an eye sore. I feel like this isn't something you need for every room. We just do the kitchen and living room. Plus, I would only uses indoors, probably not a good outside camera. The quality is good enough for a security camera, don't expect anything fancy. It does work pretty good at night too. I don't check often, but you do have to update every now and then. You don't have to use an sd card, but you have more capability.",5,1,2018-12-24,1,1,0
"I have bought multiple cheaper cameras (mostly Chinese) but all of them lack free cloud sync. Heard so much about Wyze lately that I picked one up while it was only for $20. Camera build and quality is decent for the price but I think my other 1080p cameras have better video than this one. I had issues with this from day 1. Whenever I go to the app for viewing live feed, 7/10 times it gives me some error. I read the reviews and so many other have complained about the same. The only good thing about this is, it does save 12 seconds of data when it detects movement (for free) and the recording works all the time even when the live view doesn't. I've never had any viewing issues with Chinese branded cameras even while I was out of town.For $20, I have 0 regrets on this one but I was expecting a bit more.

However, in my inbox for that same email address I still had two emails from Wyze, one of which confirmed my account back when I set it up.  There was a link in that email that I clicked which allowed me to update my profile (really just my name) which I did.  I tried to change my password again and got the same response.  So I went to ""chat"" and that was with a bot that gave links to answers that didn't answer my login problem.  I put in a request for assistance and explained the problem.  It will take 2 - 5 business days to get a response.

"I have had 3 of these cams working for over a month now. The first one had a defect wherein it would not detect motion and thus would not create notifications. Wyze was very understanding and sent me a new one at no cost. I use one on my 3D printer in a dark enclosure and the night vision works great to see my prints. I also use two in my garage and again the night vision is very good. The motion and sound detection is quite sensitive at the highest sensitivity setting. It detects dust particles in front of the camera about once a week. It also detects rapid changing shadows since I have a window in my garage. I will say that the notifications from the Wyze app about motion or sound events that they detect have a lot of variation in the delay. For example, sometimes, I will get a notification of an event detected by one of the cameras up to 5 minutes after it has happened. This could be something outside of Wyze's control such as cellular network issues or something else not related to wyze products. But just be aware that you may not always receive notifications right away.",4,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0

When she freaked out I was sure I had caught it on my camera footage. Guess what -NO! The footage “glitched” right when the man approached window and started back up after he left. Today a woman tried to walk in our home. She is on the footage but the Wyze SD card I bought won’t record it so I can forward it to the police department. I will never buy Wyze again. Think twice before buying. Ideally I would like my money back in all six products I bought that clearly do not work.,1,1,2019-9-8,1,1,0
"I guess you get what you pay for. They claim this is a 1080P video camera--no way. I have 1080P surveillance cameras on my house--compare this to them side-by-side and not even close. The video compression is so severe that areas of the image are always blocky and blurry. The snapshot images are a bit better but still not good. The video is so bad that that person's face 15 feet away is not clear. I worked with Wyze and they thought it was defective, so I sent it back to Amazon and got a replacement--no better--sent back the second one. I sent Wyze sample images and they agreed it was not good. The poor quality is a feature, not a bug. Speaking of bugs, the software is a bit buggy and not very intuitive. They need a professional interface developer to make it better. (I'm a former software developer.) The camera might work OK for close up applications. I'll check out the Blink Mini to see if is any better. If not will have to go for a more expensive model of something.",2,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"I absolutely love this camera—it has made my job so much easier.  I’m a full-time caretaker for an 86 year-old with dementia.  Thus, my camera is named “Granny Cam.”Some people with Alzheimer’s tend to want to “go home” even when they’re already at home.  It’s a strange phenomenon, most likely because the house they’re currently in is unfamiliar to them since sometimes they only have their childhood memories.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,1
"I bought 2 of these, arrived at different times. Both needed a router reset to work / connect properly. Called tech support, they had me send them info on my router and connections to the router - it was an unknown what was being sent as you send them results which you can't see. This was a bit uncomfortable, but support it worked out. Tech supports conclusion was that I had to many things connected to my wi-fi (??) all else worked fine - but not these. So I had to reset the router and all connected fine. I had to do this twice (another time when the 2nd one arrived). I do really like these cameras. Motion detection is great. YOU do only get 12 seconds of video stored w/o SD card, which does not catch all the motion you might like to record. Put in an SD card and you can record a long time - depending of the size of the SD card. I'd buy another but the price seems to be going up - so I'll wait until they are on sale again.",4,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"I don't understand HOW this camera is this price.  I now have two of them (one monitoring front door, other side gate) and I get push notifications any time a ""Person"" comes into view.  I can change that to any ""motion"" but I don't need to know every time the wind blows making the shadow of the tree in my front yard move.  I did buy a SD card which I plopped into both cams which I can review at any time using the app.  The App ALSO logs all motion separately from People (through AI) and you can review those as well with a thumbnail basically capturing the middle of the ""incident.""  You can create rules around when to send pushes and when to ignore movement.  You can create rules around other tools WYZE sells (like motion sensors/door sensors).  This is a GREAT product.  VERY HAPPY I went with this over one of the big dollar systems that would have been $200+ out the door PLUS monthly subscription...  Oh yeah everything I talked about above is FREE after purchase!  CRAZY!",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"I use these for security around my house and I come from a CCTV background, having worked in the field for many years. For so long I questioned why companies weren't pushing for more affordable digital options and i'm happy to see Wyze has. There are definitely some downsides but in comparison to the old style analog systems, these only take minutes to set up vs possible days install depending on how many cams you choose. I now purchased an extra one of these to turn it into a livestream RTMP cam. I am able to stream it directly to my OBS using an nginx server. While these are great for home surveillance, I did find that for streaming it only sent glitchy audio and the video is only good if you are not moving the camera. As soon as you start moving it around everything gets pixelated and looks like garbage. I know this isn't what the camera was intended for but I wanted to post this here for anyone else looking to do the same.",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"I am very happy and satisfied with these Wyze cameras. There are many helpful reviews on youtube for these Wyze cams. LifeHackster is one of the best ones to watch for detailed setup and review. No issues at all or problems with the Wyze cam v2. I did a lot of research on different security cameras before I decided to buy these cameras. In fact, you can't beat the quality of these cams for the price. I bought two for outside and one for inside and they work great. I also bought the Wyze sensor starter kit which comes with one motion sensor and two door sensors that work with cameras. Now I have a complete security system at an affordable price. I really hope that Wyze adds a loud alarm that can be added to my Wyze products in the near future. Thanks Wyze for a great product.",5,1,2019-5-23,1,1,0
"Overall a nice and compact product with good coverage.  It gives you a sense of comfort when away from home as you can watch your pets, home delivery, unexpected motion etc. For some reason I haven’t had much luck getting any of the memory cards (from 4GB to 128GB) to work.Couple of ideas that can improve the product:",4,1,2019-8-11,1,1,0
"I've tested this camera several times and I'm not satisfied with the experience.First of all it failed to detect most of the motions. I knew about that 5 minutes blackout time (which is non-sense in my opinion) after each motion detection but that's not the reason I'm complaining. This is a cheap camera that doesn't capture most of the motions. Besides, it only capture the first 12 seconds of video if a motion is luckily got detected, unless you pay a subscription fee. This is totally non-sense.",2,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
"I was in the market for an inexpensive camera system that would broadcast wirelessly and be viewable from anywhere so I could monitor the house when I'm not at home.  These Wyze cameras and the supporting app delivered on that and more.  I've been using them for a couple of weeks now, so here is my full review.Setup was a snap and the phone app is intuitive and well thought out.  A thoughtful and helpful feature they have incorporated is when you initially set up your camera, the app lets you know right away if there's a firmware upgrade available, which will download and install automatically at your command.  Don't be surprised if the app crashes from time to time during normal use once everything is set up (although it's likely my old phone, a Samsung Galaxy S5), just restart the app and you're back in business.  You can have as many cameras as you wish, but only view one camera at a time.",5,1,2019-2-12,1,0,0
"All or none notifications, you either get notified every time something moves in your home or never. There is no way to be alerted if someone is on your camera while you're not home.You have to open the app, go to settings, and manually select to receive notifications from the app EVERY SINGLE TIME you leave home, and manually turn it off in the app EVERY SINGLE TIME you come home.

I tried everything from power cycling to factory reset and nothing, nothing works. Support via email is non-existent.

"This camera was easy to set up and actually has a decent camera.  I have it inside a window looking out. Although the night vision a bit dark due to a medium lite patio. I am going to get a motion sensor light that is brighter as suggest and shown on YouTube. The cost was what sold me as I am disabled and can't afford more expensive security. Set up was easy. I added the app to my android and ipad. Both work great EXCEPT for it doesn't take video or notify me of motion. The live stream works very well though. I want video and notifications though. I read online that many problems are caused by the new firmware update. Hopefully they resolve the issue immediately. I have chatted with Wyze and have received email on a trouble ticket they submitted. I followed their instructions for my issues. Power cycled the device, that didn't take care of it. Reformatted the device, that didn't do it either. So now I am waiting to hear back from them. I will keep the camera for the live stream, but they really need to fix what is going on. I will update review later if things change.",2,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"I came to know about this camera from one of my friend, and found lot of good reviews in Amazon. Since my purchase , i am struggling to get the recording work on this camera, i can view live stream from the app but not recording to SD card or Cloud. On top of it, i am not able to login to Website which says invalid credentials, where same login works in Wyze app. their support works on only on emails, but that too too much delay. i dont know why they mention support hours in website while they take a week to get back. That too the response comes with links from product guide, does not even relate to what the customer complains. I called Amazon, for tech help (using the option in my order page), they were quick to understand the frustration and say just return the product, for refund.  The 1 star is more for Amazon and the compact design of this camera.",1,1,2019-2-18,1,2,0
"I have three wyze cams and have gifted two.I originally bought a wyze cam to record clouds and sunsets with front porch security as a bonus.  I love to set a time lapse.

"Wyze phone support is excellent (other than having too short open hours, closing at 3 pm MT at present at least). After extensive debugging on my own and with Wyze phone support, they decided my cameras may be defective as they will not record to SD cards that are within their required size range, after reformatting, etc. I didn't even need to ask--they are sending me new cameras at their expense (including shipping), only requiring photos of the labels and normal contact information from me to precess the replacements. Once I receive the new cameras, if they will properly record to the SD cards, I'll raise the review to five stars, For now, the cameras work fine for viewing remotely, I just cannot record and save any movement.One feature I really like on these cameras that I've never seen on another camera (and I own and have owned numerous brands over the hears) is the magnetic base. That makes it very easy to locate the camera in all kinds of locations without drilling any holes and the like.",4,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"Bought this camera to film the corner in front of our house. People either completely blow through the stop sign or roll it, this includes a bunch of municipal vehicles.... Have it outside and we just went through -25 degrees. Did not hiccup once. Picture is perfect, however, when you use the motion detection, even the lowest setting for the sensitivity does not stop a branch from triggering. It would be nice to be set sensitivity to a lower threshold. Other than that, no complaints here.It came nicely packaged, almost like a apple product. The body of the camera is very solid feeling. Easy to setup. No wait, SUPER easy to setup. Everything about the packaging seemed well thought out, just a little square box. I did not need nor see the instructions until after I had already installed it. Just download the WYZE app beforehand and follow the instructions.",5,1,2019-1-31,1,0,0
"I have several Wyze cameras as well as other brands including Nest.  Wyze cams generally work well for the price point.  I especially like that they show you a box around what triggered a motion alarm.  There are very few things a frustrating as a camera that alerts you for no apparent reason.  The IOS app works well and the available settings allow me to do most anything I need to do with the cameras.  The night vision seems about as good as my Nest Camera.  One of my cameras had more and more trouble connecting to the network.  I finally moved the camera within 3 feet of the router and it would still not connect.  Technical support worked with me to troubleshoot the issue, but it appears to be a bad camera.I rated this camera 3 stars.  I would hope it would last over 3 months, but tech support seems to be responsive so I raised the rating.  I just don't really want to spend hours and hours trying to get a camera to work reliably.",3,1,2019-6-20,1,0,0
"I am, once again, updating my review. LISTEN UP.  I have 5 of these. The hardware is excellent for the price. BUT THE SOFTWARE ABSOLUTELY IS CRAP. You will not be able to see live, record, playback or anything without serious software malfuntions. You have to do everything at least twice, maybe three times to get anything done. The cameras keep quitting in the middle of viewing, playing back or recording. Messes up everything and just takes so much more time to do anything, not to mention that you end up with a bunch of tiny length recordings that you then have to edit or stitch together via an external software program you have to by. NO, the free editing junk is just that. The app is just horrible. Even worse since the latest ""upgrade"". It only works on phones, tying up your device completely. You cannot do anything else while using the Wyze app. Nothing. It shuts down, stopping whatever you are doing if you answer a call, make a call, send or receive a text, etc. So don't plan on using your phone for anything. No multitasking allowed. My earlier review stands. This is an even worse review because the issues just keep multiplying. I have no idea why I bought a 5th cam.. That's the definition of stupidity. Guess I was hoping the manufacturer would read these things and reach out to try to fix them. I cannot be the only one with issues like this. But I do use the app a lot even though it adds hours to my week to try to capture the things I need. I just cannot afford the higher priced cameras, but maybe I am stupid and should begin to replace the Wyze one at a time.I am updating my review. I now have 4 of these, one of which is a pan and scan model. The cameras themselves work fine. However, the Wyze app is very weak. It will cause lots of frustration since the cameras are no good without the app.",1,1,2018-9-11,1,1,0
"If you’re thinking of buying one of these cameras to use with an Amazon Echo Show/Amazon Echo Spot you should know that the Wyze cameras have wonderful picture & sound, BUT they only work for less than ten minutes at a time on the Show & Spot. After about ten minutes, the cameras shut off and you have to request that the camera be viewed again. It’s incredibly annoying if you’re attempting to use these cameras to monitor things like your child’s playroom or especially the nursery. We had to return these otherwise great cameras simply because they won’t stay connected to the Amazon products they’re supposed to work with. They are listed on here as a product which “works with the Amazon Echo Show/Spot” but it would be really nice if it specified “works for less than ten minutes”. This would have saved us a lot of trouble in calling tech support through Amazon & Wyze simply to find that Amazon has set this timer with the Wyze cameras. We ended up having to buy the Amazon Cloud Cam for about $80 more per camera because they continue to stream live until you tell the Show/Spot to stop. Obviously, this is so that you will buy Amazon’s camera instead of Wyze’s camera, and we understand that, but it should really say somewhere that it doesn’t work for very long. Hopefully, this review helps save someone the hassle of buying multiple cameras. The Wyze camera does work great through the Wyze app, but it still shuts off on its own at some undetermined amount of time (usually a few hours) on both Android products and Apple, so if you need continuous streaming, like we do, these cameras don’t seem to be the best for that. Also, they make you pay for shipping in order to send the Wyze cameras back for a refund, so that’s not great customer service in my opinion.",3,1,2019-1-27,1,0,0

During set-up, however, I did not receive the promised audio prompts from the camera.

"The Wyze cam v2 interfaces with my Samsung phone camera and interferes with function and operation.  My Samsung phone camera used to produce the clearest and brightest pictures but, after installation and use of wyze cam, my phone camera  images and pictures have become significantly blurred that my Samsung camera function has become useless (except the selfie).  It came to the point that whenever I attempted to snap a picture with the Samsung phone camera, I had to instantly click it, else the image I aimed at would quickly disappear from view and replaced by the wyze cam function--this phenomenon ceased after I informed Wyze customer service.The image on the wyze cam itself is acceptable but not of the highest quality, and had deteriorated over two weeks time from initial installment.  The playback and night images have been blurred and hazy, the degree of which varies.  It seems images can be somewhat improved by remote from the wyze tech station, but they can do nothing with restoring the functionality  of my Samsung phone camera.",2,1,2019-9-14,1,0,0
"This camera just will not connect remotely. I'm on a 4G/LTE network so my cellular connection is not the problem. I really need to be able to confront whoever is entering my home with the two way speaker but if it won't connect to a live stream that's impossible. It's also extremely difficult to view playback video from the app on the SD card. If you don't position the red line in exactly the right place you get a message saying there's no video to view for the time selected, but there are videos on the SD card.  You should just be able to press a button and get your recorded video. I am deleting the app and returning the camera. Unfortunately having spent countless hours reading reviews and doing research I don't see an alternative that doesn't cost a small fortune. None of the cameras on Amazon seem to work very well and the reviews are rated even worse. UPDATE: After sending the camera back I stuck the SD card in my laptop and viewed all the contents. I couldn't believe how often the camera recorded activity when it was turned off from the app and didn't provide a notification. You have to completely unplug it if you are home and don't want to be recorded.

"UPDATE:I'm giving this 4 stars (it was 1 star).  After many calls and emails, I was able to reach someone via email who responded and communicated with me until the problem was solved.  The camera always worked fine but I was not receiving any alerts.  As well as for some reason the camera won't give me pop-ups on my phone (Galaxy s8 ) as it should. (It works for my text mssgs but not for this camera.) However it does give an alert sound (that I chose) as well as a notification (just not a pop-up which I prefer). It has a good motion, sound detection and picture is clear.  It only records I think 11 seconds then does not start recording again until 5 seconds. Add sound detection and it'll record within 3 sec. So it's not continuous but it'll work ok for me. I just need to know who isn't respecting my privacy and entering my room. 😲 Not sure I would use it for major security because you might miss something important.  Would be 5 stars if I received the pop-ups and if it recorded longer with no pauses or downtime.",4,1,2019-8-30,1,0,0
I was looking for an inexpensive camera to use to watch my puppy when she was in her crate alone. Mostly just for peace of mind. We don’t leave home much. I didn’t want to pay a subscription or anything like that. This is the perfect camera for what I need! It’s small. Easy to set up. I put a micro sd card in it and get alerts and constant recording. It’s easy to move around. The set up was super easy too. I debated between this one and the slightly more expensive model that pans. In hindsight I might have chosen the other one but this one is great too! In the future I might add a few more cameras!,5,1,2020-7-18,1,1,0

It has a 5 minute cooldown after it detects a motion event!!Basically, lets say something triggers the camera, like dust flying across the camera. The camera will record 12 seconds and then for the next 4 minutes and 48 seconds if anything happens, the camera will not detect it!!!

Got this too check in on my cat when I'm away from home. The set up was easy. Keep in mind you must have a 2.4ghz wireless signal. I did have to set one of those up as I normally run 5 GHz. But wasn't hard to do. The app connected perfectly. The only issue I ran into was it not reading the SD card. Took a bit of fiddling back and forth with formatting it a few times on a PC to get it to recognize it. I don't leave it running 24/7 but I will mention it does seem to get a bit warm on top even off. Basically if it's plugged in even though off  it must still be connecting to the WiFi. A little worrisome but that might just be me and my OCD about fire safety. I absolutely wouldn't keep it on when I don't need it. Anyway..The picture is really clear and I haven't experienced any lag in viewing. I have tested the motion alerts and tho a bit delayed they do work nicely And the ability to send audio to the camera is a really night feature.

Once finally connected I changed the router settings back to dual band, cuz who wants to run their router/wifi at half speed ALL THE TIME...Well BAM the cameras automatically disconnected and would not reconnect!

"Internet connected home security cameras are a privacy nightmare no matter what, but with this piece of equipment you can have the sketchiest option available. This thing runs hot even when it's ""turned off"". Maybe it's just built inefficiently, and it happens to waste exactly enough energy when it's off to match the temperature of when it's running, but to me this is a signal that it is still processing video. I haven't wiresharked it cuz I had a limited use and don't care beyond that, just unplugged it, but it's sketchy af.The audible noise it makes to signal to you that it has mechanically shut off is a joke since it comes from a speaker.

If you are looking for a reasonably priced option for a camera, this is it!  *Note:  It is not powered wirelessly, so you need access to an a/c outlet to it.

HOWEVER; four times I just happened to be near the door and hear the doorbell.  Eager to see the video of the delivery person, I quickly checked the time so I could line up the playback time, but each of the FOUR times the camera did not record the motion because it was recovering for 5 minutes!

The biggest pain is the lack of PC support.  Because of this, we only use it sporadically.  We bought this cam to keep an eye on our dogs when we're not in the room (they're always getting into something).  The app for android works, but I don't like to have to repeatedly check my phone...and god forbid you hear something and by the time you've scrambled to find your phone to see what the commotion was...it's too late.  I've used it on the fire tablet, and while I can set the screen to not shutdown for up to 30 minutes, it's still a pain to get back up again.  I know that if you're willing to jump through enough hoops (through android emulation and such) that you may be able to get something to work, but it seems like a lot of effort.  I spend 90% of my waking hours on the PC...both for work and entertainment.  It just seems to me like it would be a no brainer to be able to access the video through a browser (which I could keep open constantly) and would be far more convenient.",1,1,2020-6-14,1,1,0
"Can't beat the camera for this price. We were considering several camera options and the price won us over on this one. Setup is easy, picture quality is great, night vision is pretty good, too. The motion detection is good and can the scaled down to avoid too many false positives. It also has a feature to try to detect a person so you can filter out animal or other motion from actual human motion. This works most of the time but sometimes it doesn't get it right. I highly recommend using a micro SD card and turning on continuous recording because the 12 second recordings that are hosted free for 14 days may miss something important and there seems to be a cool down for about 5 minutes after motion is detected before another recording is triggered. The continuous recording gives you a chance to go back and review all footage (until space runs out and it deletes the oldest footage.) Screenshots and video recordings are easily saved when playing back footage to save them forever to your local device. The app also allows setting up rules so you can only record motion at certain times, turn the camera on or off, and control which notifications you get. Cameras can also be shared easily to other users.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0
"As an old saying: 'you get what you paid for'; I didn't expect too much from its performance.It arrived about 5 wks ago and I tested its usefulness as a security camera and a recording device; I installed a 128 GB micro disk but it did not recognized its presence. Probably this is an isolated incidence and I continue to proceed to other features such as hardwares. This camera has good resolution and I was able to observe remotely with clear pictures. However, software could use much improvements such as sound alarm features, that constantly generated false alarms due to background noises. It is a nuisance and may affect this camera sales in the future. Motion detection feature is much better compare with its terrible sound recording capability.",2,1,2020-8-12,1,0,1

"Great camera's for the price. I would like to see a web GUI for the camera's themselves accessible via web browser (local access). There are some various website that claim to walk you through adding these to other camera programs etc. I prefer to keep my camera's isolated from the internets so I would like another way to manage them that doesn't include the phone app. The app itself works great, simple and straight forward. Camera's are simple to mount but do note they are not weather resistant so indoors is where they need to go unless you are purchasing some kind of outdoor case for them. You can't mount them behind glass at all as the IR glare just makes them useless. So not super great for pointing out through a window for night watching but works fine for daylight hours. I choose to use the removable command sticky things for mounting the metal plate (camera uses magnet to attach to the plate so you just stick the plate where you want to mount the camera) so as to not ruin the wall with the included adhesive. Overall so far they are working great and you can't beat that price. Wow.",5,1,2019-6-17,1,0,0

My only real complaint is that if you have multiple cameras, you can’t view them at the same time or even easily toggle back n forth between cameras. It takes a few seconds for each camera to come on screen which is a long time when you’re watching your baby. I have 2 kids under the age of 2.

"My first do-it-yourself camera installation (ROCAM) finally gave up the ghost after 15 months on the job.  Although the ability to move the camera angle of view was useful, I found that it wasn't really necessary for me.  Therefore, looking for a replacement, a fixed camera would do...a fixed camera that wouldn't cost any more than my ROCAM.  So, I took the plunge with one Wyze camera, at $24.99 Prime plus tax, a bargain.  I was impressed with the ease of setup, the picture quality and the compactness.  I did not want to rely on a sticky ring and magnet base for my attachment, however.  So, I bought a $9.99 after market adjustable mount that screws into the wood of my eaves.  That said, I temporarily set up my first camera with the provided sticky ring and plate on my old camera mount.  I don't know what the sticky ring is made of, but I could not pry it off my old camera mount.  The sticky part is a solid attachment.  I don't know how secure the magnet attachment would be for strong winds and vibrations from slamming doors, etc.  The night vision illumination has been a bit of a disappointment compared to the previous camera.  It'll do however, unless I have ninja visitors  The back porch camera has difficulty illuminating the brown outdoor carpet.  So, I placed little reflectors at various points to give me an outline of the floor area I want monitor at night.  It's a moot point now since I added a motion floodlight for that area as well.  I do like the fact that short term free cloud storage comes with the cameras.  I also have small SD cards in each camera.  The ability to pick the area that will trigger a motion alert is helpful.  I will see how helpful during an upcoming vacation.  I feel confident enough in this camera that I now have three installed outside not exposed to weather.  Some jury rigging to allow for the power cable is acceptable to me.  Someone else might not like the wire and USB adapter requirement.  As long as they work, are relatively unobtrusive and last a couple of years, I'm very happy.  We'll see about the lifespan.

I’ve been able to maintain the perimeter of my home with these cameras as long as they are within my wireless routers range.  I’m very happy with them. I added a WiFi extender to my home to keep the signal from dropping from the farthest point between cam and WiFi router. Wish I can live stream view all the cameras at once and on one page. All the cameras are listed on one page but you cannot view all cams simultaneously unless you have more than one viewer. Other than that I am very satisfied with the few Wyze cams we own and the wyze smart outlets. Easy to set up and maintain. I love the notifications and setting the detection zones to pickup certain trouble spots in my yard. I have a neighbor who has been dumping leaves onto our property for a few years but since the cameras were installed it has stopped. We have been able to keep unwanted people from trespassing on our property.,5,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0

I cannot speak to the privacy issues people have mentioned in the reviews because it's in the kittens bedroom and not in any areas we would want private. I would not put a camera in the bedroom for example because you never know who has access to this footage. But the camera is great for the purpose we use it for! I can check the video footage while I'm at work. The only thing we weren't able to figure out was how to share the acct or camera access with another user.

i purchased the camera due to theft in my dorm room.

EX: today i needed to watch the cam footage to review where some money ended up. it only recorded through the night and until 11:30 am.... i needed to see all the way through the day. this same thing has occurred multiple times and has cost me. i bought the camera thinking it would be the best for what i need but apparently my campus isn't a 2.4 GHz wifi so i hot spot my phone to set it up and set the recording feature (after some research online i figured out that;s the best way). My Wyze cam is set to record indefinitely and has cost me money and items to still be stolen i do NOT recommend this product at all.

I mean wow. I was looking at way more expensive options when I ran into some review/comparisons between the Wyze and Arlo/Nest cameras and decided to take a chance on it for $20 and so far I am very impressed. The video quality is great. I have a friend with multiple Arlo camera's and I would say the video footage is on par with the Arlo (or very close) I have two of the Wyze cameras plus one cam pan. The stand alone stationary Wyze camera has a better night vision than the pan cam version. Notifications are fairly quick when the camera detects motion. While I nitpick the camera I wish it had a Geo Fencing option that turned notifications off when my phone was home and connected to WiFi like the Arlo camera's have vs having to go into the app and turn the camera's or notifications off after I get home each day. You can set a schedule in the app but my problem with that is yeah it would be nice for Monday - Friday 8 - 5 while I am at work but that schedule doesn't help me much when I run to the store after work or go out to dinner or movies or whatever. Geo Fencing would eliminate the need for a schedule. I'd also like to see Google Assistant support. It works with Alexa but I don't use Alexa.. I do however have the Google Home Hub and of course an Android phone so Google assistance would be great.,4,1,2019-4-3,1,0,0
"I just got two (2) of these up and running a few days ago and overall, I'm happy. The initial set up is relatively simple and adding the second camera was a breeze. The picture quality is very good on one, even at full zoom. And the night vision isn't bad either.  I haven't tinkered with the motion detection or most of the other options available so I can't comment on those. I do have two issues that are irritating. The biggest issue is that the app will not work on either my tablet or Chromebook. It works very well on my phone but it is not compatible with the others. I'm sure there is a reason for this but it's beyond my knowledge. The second issue, though minor, is one camera will change from color to black and white without explanation. If I turn the camera off and restart it I get a color view. When I close the app and then log in again I sometimes get a black and white view. Not a big deal for my usage but irritating none the less. But overall I'm happy.",4,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0

I didn't need for it to pan or tilt so this was the perfect choice.  It has a magnetic mounting feature so I was able to just stick it to my rolling TV stand.  Just that easy!  One downside to the Wyze system is that the cameras are only viewable on a mobile app.  I thought there would be a way to log into the cameras from a laptop, but no.  However, I did put in an inquiry and this is something that they are working on.  As for the features, this is great.

"This is a pretty good camera for the cost.  It is cheaper to buy on the Wyze site although it takes longer to get the item and you pay for shipping.  I bought the first one on Amazon and have since purchased 3 more from Wyze directly.  The setup was easy.  I recommend getting the micro SD card and putting it in the camera as it gives you an extended time period to review alarms, although I would let the camera update to the latest firmware before inserting the SD card.  This only takes a short time during set up.  If you only use the cloud you get 12 seconds of recording on motion detection alarm and it takes 5 minutes to reset for the next alarm viewing.  With the SD card it will record continuously if there is motion in the camera view.  There are also some handy things in the app that make the cameras easy to use.  You can turn the motion detection and alarm notifications on or off using short cuts in the app.  I have set them up so that I can quickly turn them on when we leave the house and turn them off when we get home.

But I got 2 to test a week ago, then got 1 more a few days later. They are working GREAT so far and if you read the instructions from the web site they work even better.  Adding a SD card lets me record motion or non-stop video. Using the camera only you get 12 sec every 5 mins, so you can see who it was but you'll miss a lot. After putting a SD card in I can go back and see what happened after the 12 sec video stopped. The SD card will keep recording as long as the is motion or record non-stop if you have it set. For the price you can't beat it, 25 + 10 for SD card. Use class 10 , a SanDisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC UHS-I  or Transcend 32GB MicroSDHC Class10 UHS-1.Now it would be nice if the setting on the camera could be set for more than 12 seconds, but I guess that is done to save space on their drives for the free 14 days. 1 minute would be nice so if someone takes the camera.

I may try and take one apart to see if I can change the camera to a pin hole type. Also its very easy to access the videos from your phone, you don't have to have access to the camera to get the videos the SD card recorded.

"I have been looking at installing security cameras around my home for a few months. I've researched a lot of different brands including Arlo, Nest, Ring, Blinq, and so on. All have their pluses and minuses. Most have outdoor rated models. Wyze does not but, there are a host of different enclosures you can buy for short money if you want to mount the camera outdoors. I also looked at several of the cheaper Chinese models sold on Amazon in the $40-50 range and it appeared that cheap price meant cheap performance.  I recently Googled best budget home security cameras and came across Wyze Cam and read the rave reviews from many online tech sources and users and decided to order one. For 20 bucks I figured...what the hell, if it doesn't work well I didn't lose very much. I have to say, I am blown away at what you get for 20 bucks. The package is compact and clever and imparts the fact that A LOT of thought went into the design of this product. Even the packaging was well thought out. I followed the simple setup instructions and had it running in under 5 minutes. This thing is ridiculously easy to set up. I placed it in a window to overlook my driveway and the quality of the image is excellent in regular or night mode. The app is simple, has a clean, efficient interface and is extremely intuitive. I was so impressed with the 20 dollar version that I just ordered the Cam Pan for 30 bucks. I'm excited to get that today and install it in another section of my house. I haven't been this impressed with a product in a LONG time. I couldn't believe you could get so much performance for 20 bucks. I was so impressed in fact, that I did some research on the company. It's a great story. You can check it out on the Wyze YouTube channel. This company is going to completely blow up the home security camera and home automation market. Their Cyclops video is absolutely hilarious! Watch it and laugh. This company is going to grow like crazy.....",5,1,2019-2-8,1,1,0
"This is a great little cam! it sets up fast and has a great picture. I really like how the object it detects is outlined so you don't have to figure out what moved. I have Google Play side loaded on my Fire tablet, so I was able to install the Wyze app through the Play Store. That way I can just say ""Alexa, show me the living room cam"" and it will open the Wyze app full screen!  Perfect for middle of the night noises. The only drawback is that you can't turn it on and off with Alexa, you have to use the app. One star off for that.",4,1,2020-9-3,1,1,0
"So, what's new and different about this cam? Um, nothing. Just like all other cams, it does not want to stay upright or stable. It's constantly falling over or turning upside down because the cord to which it is attached is too short, or the ""bend"" in the wire makes it tricky to level. I don't like it that you don't get some sort of notification when someone else is viewing your cam; even if you got it for that purpose, you should be able to get a notification. That's pretty basic. The frame rate is horrible, it doesn't keep up at HD, rarely even at SD.",1,1,2018-12-2,1,3,0
"I use these for home security as well as pet monitoring, have had a few different types of cameras in the past, but the WYZE Cam's are by far the best to date. Easy set up, great picture quality. I have 5 cameras so far, both styles, one position and pan/tilt (both types have zoom). Putting on silicone covers (sold separately but inexpensive) for outdoor use with Zero issues in cold,snow,rain, wind. I would highly recommend these cameras for anyone looking for inexpensive security system. No fees, add SD card and you have 24/7 playback, just an awesome camera. Also recommend the new WYZE SENSE Sensors for doors, windows, I use them on Garage doors so when opened and closed sends alert, even let's you know if you left doors open, just set time you want to have notification to let you know ie: if door is left open for 10 min it tells you "" door has been open for set time"" kit comes with 2 door sensors and a motion sensor for 20 bucks, can't be beat!!!",5,1,2019-5-24,1,1,0
"We came back from vacation and we found some human size foot prints on the snow outside our house. We were wondering why there were no notifications sent to our phone. Therefore we reviewed the local video (saved in the local micro SD card) one by one. Finally, we found that it was caused by the policemen.So basically, the policemen came to our door to check our house. Their bodies occupied about 1/5 of the video screen. Their movements lasted about 90 seconds. However, there was no motion detection event on the app.",2,1,2018-12-30,1,1,0
Best purchase I’m Not Joking first was Hell to Setup. And watched the YouTube videos one how to setup.Gets me is the WiFi input when setting up I have 5g but just can’t do it so 2.5 speed where it’s my Guest WiFi but It’s working finally but yeah I Did Call Hanging on for an Hour It’s I Got it’s connected. Alexia pod is  register but dunno know and long as She Have it I would get least  some notifications instead of buying a video alexia and just use the Cam App and mic Works good and sound like Darth Vader . And mic Echo and Have my Friend tried to Break in. Aka I Asked Him to break in too see it’s picked up and mic. I Heard him good and he heard Me okay as I hold the mic Button.  But as of  Night vision goes yeah it’s okay but I cannot wait to test that too see any Ghosts or Elf’s got left behind or Something. I  Love the magnetic And ended up vlogging again it’s like a mini go pro. Just you can freak out or Pets And priceless seeing them confused. But yeah $25 half off for the holidays it’s good too Have. What up that’s pretty much it I guess I can keep saying what’s next so I can learn about hopefully I could be safe person memory card came with th what up that’s pretty much it I guess I can keep saying what’s next so I can learn about hopefully I could be safe plus a memory card came with it too  which it was handy as heck I can go back on my phone and watch it,4,1,2018-12-28,1,1,0
"This camera is great until you actually need to review the footage. Then it becomes horrible.Unlike every other camera out there since 1980, Wyze doesn't have the ability to watch video playback in fast forward. This means if you were recording overnight and wanted to find out when something happened - for example a dog having an accident - you have 2 bad options:",1,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"These cameras are all that and more. One quick note up front. When plugged in to my computers USB the cameras had a buggy connection right by the router. I think I had one on a 2.0 USB. When on a definite 3.0 and daisy chained they both worked great and when plugged into the wall they are very solid. I also set them up on Blue Stacks and they work flawlessly on my PC. All functionality works. Now I have my PTZ IPcam and my 2 Wyze cams displayed on a separate monitor and all is great. I have read that Bluestacks is a resource hog but I have 8 cores, 32 GB of ram, and a 3100 watt power supply so no issues. I have no idea why someone would mess with RTSP set up without the functionality. PS. I have crappy WiFi and the router is on the second floor of a 98 yr old house with lathe and plaster walls and both cameras are on the 1st floor. And the one in the kitchen is under a metal ceiling where cell phones sometimes have issues. No drop outs.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"Everything about this product works very well, the connection is decent and image quality is superb. The only slight downside is that the motion detection is incredibly sensitive, alarming you on the second it turns on because it noticed a single dust particle floating too closely to the lens. You heard me, it can detect even something as small as that evasive squiggle in your eyes. Aside from that though, the range on this thing is perfectly deceptive for the intruder that even I would startle myself by thinking that I’m not already in view. The user interface is super friendly, easy, and the ability to adjust wake timers and specific trigger settings is highly advanced. You won’t regret getting this security camera, it’ll save you and other’s lives, belongings, etc.10/10 will purchase way more for ease and comfort of great security.",5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"I bought this because of its high rating and didn't compare with others significantly, so it's possible that my problem exists with all such cameras.And that is I prefer to review the video on my laptop and not my phone. You can do that with this camera by hooking it up to your computer and playing the saved file. But you can only save the file while leaving your phone on while the camera is on. Because the camera takea up so much power you need to keep your phone plugged in all night. Nothing ruins your battery more quickly than doing this. The only alternative is to turn the phone off but then your only option is to preview the video on your phone.",3,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
"This camera was a total waste of my money.  It is not reliable.  Half the time, it goes offline.  When it did record a few events, I tried to sort the events by persons only and it wouldn't perform the action.  I really don't need to see the 100+ cars that go back and forth on my street.  I just want to see people walking up to my front door.  I bought this camera because it will work through window glass (during the daytime only--night vision will not work).  It does work through glass but I have a big problem with the going offline issue.  I have Arlo cameras that are attached to the outside of my home.  They work beautifully.Update:  The camera hasn't detected people at all for several months now.  My understanding is that they're working on a new person detection program.  The company is coming out with weight scales, wrist bands, etc.  I think they should focus on perfecting the camera before venturing on to other products.",1,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"I can't stop buying them. Loved my first one and over a short amount of time I ended up with 4 more. I also have one of those cheap Swann 4 camera DVR things too but those things are junk and these $25 cameras absolutely destroy them. The picture quality is totally sufficient, the night mode is surprisingly good, they have a nice wide angle view, and they actually hold up against bad weather (I use one of those outdoor mounts/enclosures for one of my cameras out front and so far it's held up against storms, cold, and a little snow). I put a 32GB microSD in each of them and they can hold about 5 days worth of non-stop recording for playback. Setup is also quick and painless and only takes a minute.I kind of want to buy more but I don't have anywhere to put them as the whole outside of my house is now covered. Very highly recommend",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
This is a revision to my original 4 star review for this camera. The advertisement states that the camera is for indoor use only. It states that it is not waterproof. Since it had good reviews and was pretty inexpensive I decided to try it in my semi-enclosed front porch area. It is totally protected from any rain. My home is in Florida so high temperature was a concern but the upper temperature spec for the camera is 104 degrees F.My camera failed after a few weeks even though temperatures had been in the low 90s. At first it was intermittent and could be reset by removing and reapplying power. Later it failed totally. I wrote to the manufacturer and they promptly voided my warranty since I had installed it outside. Without their saying as much I can only conclude that the total failure was the result of high humidity.,4,1,2019-6-16,1,0,0
They are really good for the price.  Not great but good.  The main issue i have has is clouds.  On a partially cloudy day you will trigger a lot of false notifications.  Not a big deal but can sometimes be annoying.  Night vision is ok with some light but not great when almost completely dark.  I have three of them installed and I do not believe there is a limit to how many you can connect.  They do not require a hub which is really nice.  Each camera works on its own connecting to your wifi.Setting it up is really easy.  Takes about 3-5 minutes to do once you read the instructions.  You can also adjust the detection zone so only certain areas on camera screen can trigger alerts which is nice since our driveway appears to be the local turn around one :),4,1,2019-3-1,1,0,0
"I have been using YI cameras, but thought I'd try one of these, as it is almost half the price.  Setup was similar to the YI.  The Wyze is more compact with a better base mount.  Others have commented on security concerns and the app, which I see as similar.  I like the YI app for it's scrolling of the pic when viewing in portrait mode on your phone. The YI had a Windows app, so I can view it on My PC.Picture quality is ok; I have add side by side pics from the to cameras and you can see that the Wyze has a significantly bigger field of view, but also significantly more distortion of lines near the edges.  I would say that it is unacceptable it you want good video, but fine for a wide security view.  Overall, I like the YI better, especially for the ability to view on a PC.",4,1,2019-6-11,1,1,1
"I use this to investigate when my pet jumps her pet gate so I can see how she's doing it. I get motion alerts so I can intervene if she does jump it but since it's a higher traffic area these can be annoying. You can set an area that gets monitored in the camera's view which is an awesome feature, but it still gives me a lot of alerts.The camera quality and features, like two way speaking, is really great for the price. The adhesive and magnet to wall mount with no hardware is really strong, and the cord is very long and feels high quality.",4,1,2019-6-13,1,0,0

I will say I’m highly impressed by this product! It exceeded all my expectations! It has amazing night vision! It notifies you when there is sound and movement and the sensitivity levels of Those can be customized. It allows you to talk through it and I can view my baby from anywhere I’ve been in the grocery store and checked to see if it worked still and it does! The app is easy and simple to use I love love love it. I will say it was smalle than I expected and felt really cheap coming out of the box but it is great! Also note it has to stay plugged in,5,1,2018-11-28,1,3,0
Absolutely worth every penny. This camera has by far exceeded my expectations. It does exactly what it needs to do and at an amazing price. Needless to say I bought three of them to monitor my house. Let me go thru the pros and cons.Pros,5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,1
Nowhere in the ads (both Amazon and Wyze direct) does it mention a TRIAL PERIOD for storage of videos. It does say you get a 14 day free period for storage of videos. It does not mention a monthly fee thereafter. I took this to mean that the videos would be wiped after that period. Nowhere in the ad does it state that after 14 days there will be a $1.98 per month fee for the storage. It only shows up in the e-mail Wyze sends you after the 14 days are up. Very crappy and very misleading. Take your $1.98 per month and put it where the sun don't shine...,1,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0

"Tech-savvy guy and I'm really surprised by how nicely this camera works. Alerts, recordings, micro SD compatibility, and 14 days of cloud storage - this is an excellent deal with a great app.Extremely happy with this camera in all aspects, save for the overly sensitive motion detection for dust (yes, I've lowered the sensitivity a couple times). Great camera, app, and magnetic holder. Sure, the audio isn't that great compared to other companies, but it's a $25 camera and the video definition is on par with competitors which is obviously the most important aspect. Insane people are just discriminating against the China-based location in the low-star reviews. Research Wyze across Reddit or the web in general to see how attentive they are to consumer and privacy issues.",5,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0
"I don't write reviews as a rule, but I felt compelled in this case to advise on my experience with these cameras after six months of use. Don't waste your money! I purchased five of these units and the cameras are completely and totally unreliable, basically useless! I have been round and round with Wyze Tech Support for months, to no avail. The cameras shut off by themselves, they default back to their preset boxed settings on their own, including the notifications settings, which shut down repeatedly.  When someone comes to your door, you'd never know it! The Wyze Tech said that it might be our wifi system, so we had the provider come out and check, twice! Our system is running as it should, according to the provider. The Wyze tech decided to inform me that these are ""Life style cameras"" not security cameras. I don't get it, the whole point of having cameras is to protect your home, your pets and other needs you feel cameras are important too have on site. I believe that Wyze has a server issue that they refuse to admit is having a problem, or their software and technology is substandard. Wyze has not been able to resolve any of the issues these cameras are having. But, I guess for twenty bucks a pop, I shouldn't expect much, that much is true of these cameras!Wyze sent me a camera directly, in an effort to determine if the cameras I purchased through Amazon, were defective. Their camera suffers from the same issues repeatedly, that the others suffer from. We have decided to have a professional security camera company come out and install real cameras. Hopefully that will resolve the frustration and provide reliable protection. And, as for the Wyze Cams, in the trash!",1,1,2019-12-30,1,1,0

"Ive had a uniden security system for years thats wireless however it was lacking internet access. Then I stumbled upon these. They were everything I was after: cheap, wireless, wifi connected, night vision, motion tracking, speaker for 2 way communication, and indoor/outdoor. I figured for $25 it would be worth a shot and I wouldnt be out much.All I can say is that this is the best investment I've made in a while. They work seamlessly even on our slow ADSL+ internet connection. I have 5 cameras at home and added optional wyze sensors to detect open windows/doors and another 4 at my friends house that I crash at from time to time. I can manage both and get alerts right away without delay. Very rarely I'll have a cpnnection error but upon reconnecting a few seconds after it works fine.",5,1,2019-5-4,1,0,1
"I LOVE this camera! Make sure you purchase a 32GB Micro SD card with it for reviewing timeline videos. Originally, I had mounted I side of the house, looking out a window. When the camera is mounted inside of a window, night vision does not work properly. I bought a third-party outdoor mount and resolved that issue quickly.The motion detection needs to be dialed in for your location. You can set a specific zone and adjust the sensitivity. This was useful for us as the wind blowing through the neighbors tree was enough to trigger a notification of motion detection.",5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0

"These cameras are inexpensive and have a very easy setup. The picture quality is good, although the sound quality is not great. I was initially very impressed with them and ended up purchasing two. However after months of use I've decided the limitation of 12 second clips with a 5 minute cool down between clips is a big problem if you want to use these cameras for security and/or surveillance. I prefer my Amazon cloud cam for that role. Sure it is more expensive but it is not hampered by these same time limits that the Wyze camera has.",3,1,2019-5-9,1,2,0

A previous camera from another company had lots of problems reconnecting to the Internet. This one does not. I have it set up in my house in Mexico and it is working perfectly, alerting me of motion and sending me live videos. The only problem I have had is in set up – it proved to be rather difficult to get the camera to read the code off my phone. It had to be at some precise, magical distance to get it to work. Otherwise, I would give this five stars.",4,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"I've seriously ordered over a dozen network cameras from Amazon and Newegg in the last 10 years or so. Most brands are hit and miss. Which is weird since the majority of them look like they came out of the same factory in China. There are only a couple of brands that I've found to be satisfactory. Foscam and Faleemi. Every other brand either has some kind of hardware issue, quality issue, or end up having horrible software.This Faleemi 720p camera is my second Faleemi. I have the higher end 1080p one with the SD card slot for watching my front porch and packages that could get stolen. This one was relatively easy to set up, and can be viewed using the Faleemi app or the fantastic Net Eye app that I use for multiple brands at one time. The only catch is, in order to figure out what are the IP addresses (and MAC) for the Faleemi cameras, you have to use a separate program called Search Pro by them. It seems like an obvious thing to just have more detailed network info displayed in the main Faleemi app. Hopefully that makes it in one day.",5,1,2018-12-26,1,0,0
"I have had this little guy operating for over a year problem free. As of the last firmware update, it no longer records or sends notifications. To boot, I received an email from Wyze stating that their servers were compromised and that my personal data had been stolen. I'm assuming that there is a wide issue with these as Amazon no longer shows current reviews though they still list the camera for sale.This is a real bummer as I loved the value and the phone app. I have walked through all of the troubleshooting but seeing how all like complaints started at the same time, I am skeptical that the issue is local to my environment. Wyze was a company that almost had it right. Too bad they have declined to fix a known issue that is a show stopper for almost anyone who buys their product.",1,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"The wyze camera was super easy to set up, and I put it on a shelf above our dogs playpen. I was so happy with how it worked after the first use that I immediately ordered a second camera.Big mistake. My wyze camera never worked again after that first time. Totally dead. No lights go on.

"This camera works really well.  The video quality is great and the setup using an Android phone was a snap.  Only took about 10 minutes total.  Note that you only get 12 seconds of motion video every 5 minutes using the cloud storage only.  That is, if you leave your house at 7AM and someone kicks you door in at 7:02, the camera will not store that video or send you a notification on your phone.  If you add an SD card this is not an issue.  You can either capture constant video that wraps around when the card is full or you can record all motion video which lasts much longer.  It is only a couple bucks for an SD card and it make the camera much more useful.  You can access all playbacks and live video and audio remotely from the mobile app.  You can interact with the audio of the camera.  If you want to drop in on the audio on the camera or speak into the camera, you can do that in the app.  Note too that when you watch a playback it does (sometimes?) store it in your local phone video gallery which you may or may not like.  You have to delete the video manually from your gallery.  Very happy overall and for the price it is a great value.",5,1,2019-2-13,1,0,0

I paid $24.39.Cons: With SD card: Don’t use as a security camera because it is limited to 12 second burst with a 5-minute “cool-down”.  You can not control that. During set-up, do not consent to location, not even once. Its a good dog-cam.",4,1,2020-3-1,1,1,1
The picture quality couldn't be any better.  I am so shocked that this little tiny camera has the ability to show me such a great video feed.  I love that I can pull it up at anytime on my phone and see what's going on at home.  We use this as an extra camera for my son's room and I love it much more than the $220 baby monitor we bought and already broke within a year.  My ONLY complaint is that when you need to re-log in to your WiFi it's literally the biggest pain in the butt.  I thought we could use it as a travel monitor but getting it to log into another WiFi was such a nightmare and then when we got home there had been an update and we had to log back into our WiFi again!!  I told my husband if we ever have to log in again I'm throwing it away.  If they would fix how that works it would be PERFECT!,3,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
Let me start out by saying that you can't find anything in this price range that can compete with the WYZE. I have it mounted at my front door and it will detect a person flawlessly. Motion will drive you crazy. I turned it off with in the first week. It would pick up the sun coming out from behind a cloud on the regular. The night vision is decent but I rarely look at it. I absolutely love the time lapse option. It is so cool. And the picture quality is excellent in my opinion. If you want to know when someone is at your front door or you want to be able to see if it is raining at your house while you are at work this is the camera for you. I will definitely be buying another one in the near future and would love it if they had a door bell. I'm also going to check out their other products to see if they are as high quality as the camera.,4,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"UPDATE: 10/09/18There was a firmware update and now the camera works well. I am able to connect with my android phone and iPad, and I have been consistently getting proper connections for almost a month.",4,1,2018-3-21,1,2,0
These cameras are amazing for the price! They’re just as good if not better quality than my Ring cameras. The only thing that I’m trying to fix (you toggle motion and sound detections on a 0%-100% scale of sensitivity) is how to get it to not alert me when birds chirp at 5am or when a mosquito flys by the camera (too sensitive) I’ve read other reviews saying to place a small solar light a little below or above the camera to detour them that way so they don’t go to the camera screen. I use these outside with the WYZE camera holders they’re on sale right now $5.89 for a 3 pack! I have 2 in my backyard and 1 at my front door. All of them work great. Also for those putting them outside consider buying a longer cord you can find them here on amazon 16.4 feet-30 feet for pretty cheap. I found the cord it comes with good for the front of the house but I needed the 21 foot for the back of the house. Oh also you can talk through this one just like the more expensive cameras out there! I like being able to talk through it if I need to when someone’s outside. One critique I would give is the Auto-night vision feature doesn’t always work the greatest (the sensor part of it) so it will turn on too soon. I manually set night vision to turn off and on at certain times though and it’s fine,5,1,2020-6-23,1,1,0
"Giving you a little bit of background... I got Foscam cameras ages ago and they worked but then didn’t work well with WiFi when I updated to a Netgear Orbi router.  Apparently Netgear Orbi and other mesh routers don’t play well with a lot of security cameras like Ring doorbell (which I have) and Swann (which I also have).  However with multiple firmware updates via Ring and Swann and Netgear Orbi, things are working better.  These Wyze cameras work fine with my Netgear Orbi.With all the reviews you read, all cameras will have issues with recording and motion detection.  At times a person will have come and gone and the device misses.  My Ring doorbell misses a lot.  My opinion is it depends on your situation and how the cameras are pointed and the environment.  Some reviews will tell you a camera’s motion detection is always spot on and some people will tell you the same camera is not.  Again it depends on your situation/environment.",5,1,2018-12-23,1,0,0
"This camera just doesn’t work. It may work for about 15 seconds once every 6 hours, but then it’ll freeze and disconnect and MAYBE if you close the app and reload it about 100 times it’ll start working again. For another 10 seconds. I bought this to check up on my animals while I’m away from home, and it is just far too unreliable to work. I have everything set up according to the instructions, my WiFi connection is fine, it is not an issue on my end, but with the camera.I thought I’d save a few extra bucks by buying this camera as opposed to some more expensive models, but I see my mistake now.  I would very much like to have my money back and return this.",1,1,2019-2-15,1,3,1
"I have like a dozen of these cameras and I have been a huge supporter of them. But I am finally tired of waiting for the simple ability to fast forward through the footage. It does no good to allow me to continuously record to SD card if I can’t fast forward through it to find what I’m looking for! No one wants to sit through four hours of real Time footage. So you’re forced to do the motion roulette of just randomly hitting different minutes of the video hoping that you’re actually going to see the guy steal the package off your porch. Because the motion detection didn’t catch it. For the money they’re cute cameras, but the functionality is at a standstill. They’ve been looking at providing a fast forward function for over two years now and have decided it’s just too hard. And I’m tired of waiting.",2,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0
"I wanted to add some cameras inside the house to watch the kids rooms for a just-in-case moment.  I was looking at all the big brands (nest, arlo, etc) and was going to buy a couple of expensive cameras.  One of my friends had the Wyze cameras set up in his house.  The regular one for his son and the pan/tilt/zoom for their infant/toddler.  He showed them both to me and let me play around with the app.  He has the Echo Show and it works well with that (I don't have it but plan on getting one in the future) so having the capability to watch the feeds from a monitor in the kitchen if needed is great.The regular cube Wyze cameras are light and fairly small.  I like that the come with the mounting plate and 3M tape to stick on the wall in the corner.  In my son's room, due to where i want to place it, i have to buy the extension cord which gives me an additional 5 ft for the power cable to place it where i want and mount it.",5,1,2018-12-19,1,0,0
"For $20 each, plus a few more bucks for some mounts, this is about as cheap as it gets.  I bought two of these cameras.  I placed them both outdoors in the eave of my house.  I already had a power outlet there for Christmas lights, so I just used it for these cameras.  One is pointing at the front door, and one is pointing toward my driveway.  I bought some inexpensive ""weather resistant"" cases.  The quality is pretty good.  I can't read license plates of cars on my driveway, but that's okay. (I will probably place a higher resolution camera at some point in the future)  The motion detection is great, and the app is very convenient.  The motion detection triggers with wasps flying around, but I filter it to only alert me if people are detected.  I can see the lawn man coming and going, package deliveries, etc.  The night vision is okay up close on the camera pointing at my front door, but beyond about 8 feet it's worthless, but I'm not complaining for $20.  These little cameras are a great value.",5,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0

"I purchased multiple of these cameras for my interior protection. I absolutely love this camera, I purchased the Wyze Cam v2 and the picture quality is amazing. Additionally the software is extremely user friendly. I also have 2 other cameras in which I use for exterior surveillance which are the Ring 2 and Wansview. Out of all 3 I like the Wyze the best. The night vision is extremely clear and you can even zoom. Playback is amazing which is stored on my 32gb memory card so when I receive my 12 second notifications for motion detection I can watch the full playback through the app. Additionally you can select a custom area for motion alerts from a doorway all the way to a full room. I did receive a defective cam that I sent to my girlfriend, however, when I reached out to the seller they were nothing less than being amazing and took care of me with no hassle at all. Clearly deserves a 5 star review from me. I highly recommend this product to others if you want a reliable, clear picture and user friend camera for indoor security at a very affordable price!",5,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"I bought 3 of these. They were super easy to setup and I like the fact that you get free storage. The app isn't very good though. It makes you put in the password almost every single time you go to view something. It won't allow for iOS fingerprint touch. The issue with it constantly requiring the password is that I use these for security. By the time I get the passcode in, if there were a real danger, I'd be dead. And because I have so many passwords to manage, by the time I remember this one, I'd not only be dead but I'd be rotting. THE SOFTWARE NEEDS TO BE EASIER. The cameras are not useful if I can't get to the videos in a timely manner.",3,1,2018-1-2,1,3,0
"We love these little cameras!  They give us peace of mind while we are away from home.  Not only do we get notifications when there is any type of movement--whether it be people, lights going on or off, or cars pulling into our driveway, but we also receive notifications for sounds--like when our phone rings.  This is helpful since we can call our number to pick up any messages left on our answering machine.  Since we have one camera pointed to our porch, we can tell when the guys is there to plow our driveway, or when another guy comes to clear snow from our roof and porch.  We could see the plumber coming in to winterize our home.  These cameras are fabulous tools and the price was extremely reasonable.  We have three cameras on different areas of the house.

"I'm a big fan of these little pocket cameras... i originally bought one of these because i wanted to try it out with alexa, and happy to say that it works with alexa and shows on our tv's via the fire cube perfectly (alexa, show the driveway...) ... there IS a 5-10 second lag between whats going on in real time vs what you see however, but it's manageable. There is NO time lag when viewing directly on the wyze app or tinycam. So happy with the results that i ended buying two more ... and can see pretty much anything i want within the house.The image quality is excellent and the night vision is adequate but i use tinycam app as well as the wyze app because tinycam allows me to have all three cameras live streaming on my tablet / phone... (vertically, 1/3 per camera). Wyze only lets you watch live stream from one device at a time! The zoom is also more via tinycam... (the attached screenshots is via tinycam - and note that it's taken from the INSIDE of house through a window).",5,1,2019-2-20,1,0,1
"First off this is not the best all around security camera... for security purposes, look elsewhere. For a baby, pet and keeping an eye on the kids camera It is the best overall video quality, software, 14 day free cloud storage and can't think much more to add for the low cost. It has an extremely low 15fps which leaves fast moving objects in a blur. For average people, pets and normal viewing it is great for the most part. There are several youtube video's on this version 2 and most are positive which is the reason I got one to tinker with for 20 bucks at the time I got this.  The software is not the best but far from the worst. I will be getting more of these after Christmas and just hope the price remains the same. The day and both night video blew me away and hope I didn't get a one off in Good Quality. Distance and placement where issues in the beginning but after 2 updates in the short 3-4 days I've had this it has improved but am guessing placement had a lot to do with it. It did drop connection a few times a day in the beginning requiring a reboot (remove power for a short 5-10 sec.) but the latest update hasn't dropped out yet. The digital zoom is well... digital. It works but the higher zoom level washes out the quality. I almost forgot to mention it does have sound as it states, both way's but not the best.",5,1,2018-12-17,1,0,0
"I bought one of these (now have 3), all with 32GB microSD cards.

"I had been searching for a Security Camera for my garage for awhile and then I had a friend recommend this one. When it arrived it was very small and I thought for under $25, it would be another ""You get what you pay for story""...Wow was I wrong ! This camera is AMAZING ! The video quality is Crystal clear and in color as well plus it has full sound. You can adjust the settings for sensitivity for the sound and motion that triggers it to alert you and starts the recordings. I actually had to lower the motion sensitivity because it was being triggered by bugs flying in front of it !! You can add a Micro SD card which I highly recommend to record hours of playback vs. the 12 second average video without one. This is a extreme value in a small package. The only negative thing about it is it isn't currently compatible with a ""5G"" Wi-Fi signal. Set up is quick and simple and its powered by a regular outlet plug in.You wont regret this purchase !!!",5,1,2020-5-13,1,1,0
"Completely useless as a baby monitor. My 5mo takes a lot of naps, during which he's in his crib with the curtains drawn in his dimly lit room. For me to be able to see him clearly, I have to have night vision on. When night vision is on, the camera loudly CLICKS and turns on 4 red lights. This happens every 15-30 seconds, regardless of whether you're watching the camera feed on your phone. It's impossible for anyone to sleep through, let alone a 5mo who wakes up when a floor board creaks 2 miles away. In the attached video, you can hear the click over the white noise I have playing. Maybe I'll install the camera in the playroom for the 2yo, but it can't stay in the nursery.",3,1,2019-8-9,1,1,0
"Maybe I got a defective unit, but the software is so unhelpful that I'm not much motivated to give it another try with a replacement. When I finally got it to work for a few moments, using the supposed real time live view, there was a huge delay between the time that an event occured and when you could view it on the app. l tried restarting and rebooting and reinstalling and rereading and retrying etc, nothing helped. I had the camera 10 feet away from my cable modem/wifi and it said it only was receiving 57% strength, then it told me I needed to run at 360p, then it kept telling me it wasn't connecting, then it said it something else, then it didn't do anything, then it started making a soft, kind of pained clicking sound, and then I just said forget it. At one point during several tries I actually got an image which looked reasonably good, but as I said the motion delay was ridiculous. Frustrating since it appears possible to have a decent camera at this price point--but not yet, maybe not ever with this particular camera.",1,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
"The QC symbol reader is very sensitive. This is old technology and I should not have to start over every time the software does not see the QC symbol on my phone.

I even turned off my 5g system to be sure that the camera was not getting confused by advanced technology. The camera is now waiting for UPS to pick it up and return it.

It turned on and would make it all the way to the final step of setup and then would fail connection test claiming that our internet was too fast. Bologna. We live in a rural area with standard WiFi on a very small house. Even after hours of attempting, disconnecting all devices from the internet, restart the router, etc we were still unable to get this to work.

"Why did I buy these cameras? I’m my wife’s primary caregiver and want to be able to see if she’s had a fall. I also want the nanny cam sense of security for times we have outside help care for her. I received the Wyze Camera v2 and the Wyze Pan Cam on time and began using immediately. The set up was easy (and at age 66, I’m not very good with this stuff). The app is easy to use, but don’t be fooled into thinking this inexpensive camera is limited in what it can do. If you drill down through the various sections of the app, you’ll find more sophisticated features you might only expect on more expensive products: Time/Date stamp, photo capture, video capture, Time Lapse, Sensitivitysettings for motion and sound, Smoke and CO2 alarm detection, scheduling and Person Detection (to be replaced by a new partner in 2020), Alexa compatibility and probably some more I haven’t discovered yet.I started with 1 v2 Camera and 1 Pan Cam.

"Its a powerful little guy for the price. Was able to hook it up with a powerbank and create a makeshift portable security camera. There are two problems with it however: the 1080p is only good when steady (the slightest movement makes the resolution look like fake UFO videos). Secondly, there is no computer software for the webcam (smartphone/tablet only), the only workarounds are using a smartphone emulator or to pair a phone with the computer, which defeats the purpose altogether.

For a survilliance camera, the power cord should be long enough to mount it anywhere I like. And the notification sound should be cuatomizable. It takes the default notification sound of your device. So you will not notice difference between a text notification and camera motion detection notification. Other than that, everything is great with this camera!Pros:",4,1,2019-1-12,1,0,0

I must admit I had to add a motion light in garage since it is too dark to view even during the day. Other than that they are great. They notify you in the event of motion or sound. You can run continuous or on event. You can add rules to not send notification but still record. You can also set up to show where the motion or sound is detected upon alert.

There’s really no reason, for such a low price, to not add a couple of these for convenience and peace of mind. I love being able to check on my kids when the babysitter is over - watch the amazon delivery guys throw my packages 20 feet to my doorstep - and I even added one to my chicken coop so I can tell when they need food, water, or have left me eggs.

"I moved into a good neighborhood over two years ago. Surrounding neighbors and next door neighbor are very nice and respectful. We all wave hi to each other. No one has ever trespassed on anyone's property. Towards the end of last year, I got new next door neighbors on the other side. I have to say these neighbors are quite shi**y and disrespectful. They trespass onto my property. The neighbor would dump trash on his side and blow it to mine. The kid would trash my yard. The dog is loose and comes into my yard when our city has a leash law but they still let the dog run around. Even when you talk to them nicely, it's like talking to a wall. I even have back door neighbors that consist of coyotes and owls. They don't even trespass or trash my yard. (Sorry for venting. It's been crappy this situation.) Anyway, I'm not really tech savvy with setting up outdoor cameras. Can't afford putting a front fence. I started researching on YouTube for ideas with indoor cameras by windows. One guy talked about this camera. I saw a couple of pictures on the reviews using this facing the front door. I installed this inside by my front window facing the front lawn and it's been working out good for over a week. Set up was easy on my phone. I do get some glare from the sun but the sun sets in front of my house. I turned off the night vision because it had a weird glare. I like that you can record or take pictures. I did get a few pictures of my neighbor's dog trespassing. I plan to purchase two more soon. The only small con but not really is the camera looks and feels like a fragile toy.

It was nearly twice as much on Amazon as from Wyze, but Wyze website did not appear to be secure.  Once I got and inserted the SD card, the camera would not connect with my wifi..  They do not want customers to call their customer service phone. It hung up on me after I waited half an hour. Message: ""There is no one to take your call.  Call back later.""

"I guess I was spoiled by the Sharper Image camera that I have and my expectations on this Wyze camera didn’t meet. The camera gets the minimum job done. It doesn’t alert me (maybe it’s a user error, but why is it not user friendly). The quality is just okay when the light is on. When the lights are out, it’s a struggle to make our any unfamiliar details. I’ve had it for about 6 months and it’s right next to useless. Half the time it’s frozen on a previous day (the last time I opened it). I have to refresh it each time I open to view LIVE feed only. It’s never alerted me of movement. The sound barely works. I pick up white noise if anything at all. There are better cameras out there for around the same cost. Last, it’s very difficult to place anywhere that is not stationary. It doesn’t come with screw holes and is assumed to use the magnet it comes with but that only works in certain spots and none of those spot do me any good. I’ve tried using the Velcro strips and those don’t work for it. It’s very top heavy so it takes a lot of patience to get it sturdy.

After a month the camera wouldn't even save to the sd card and I had to unplug it and remove the card, format it, reinsert the SD card, and plug the camera back in. That worked for about 3 days and then it would stop saving again. This was regardless of if it was saving just the triggered events or everything.

"These are nice cameras. They are a growing company that is coming out with some exciting new products. They will probably be bought by a major brand soon. But for now, these cameras function well, have neat features. The only downside is if you want to save footage to the cloud, it costs a small fee. Otherwise, the footage can be saved to a micro SD card. That's not a problem at all, but if a burglar saw the camera, they could destroy the camera and footage. With Blink cams, the footage is uploaded to the cloud and if the camera was destroyed, the footage is safe. But these cameras have other nice features such as motion capturing, continuous recording and a lot more. I use both brands, but plan on buying a few more. The Wyze Cam Pan is neat.

"I purchased two of these to replace traditional video baby monitors since ours won't hold a charge and we have a 2nd daughter on the way. One seems to work flawlessly. Connects without issues (or very minimal). Video quality is great, even without the HD mode on it is far better than the video monitor we have. The only thing that bugs me a bit is the delay on audio. I can hear my daughter singing in bed through the hall and the audio from the camera is a solid 2-3 seconds delayed. Not a major issue but annoying when you hear it all twice.The other one is an entirely different story. It routinely will not connect. The app will go through it's routine to connect and give me 3 suggestions: 1) close the app and try again, 2) power cycle the camera, 3) restart my router. Closing the app will work occasionally but more times than not I have to restart the camera. This would not be in an issue if i didn't have to click ""Restart Device"" 15 times (literally) to get it to finally reboot. I have yet to have it successfully reboot in a single click. I am almost always met with the ""Failed"" message and have to keep trying. After 10-15 tries one of two things will happen.

The coolest thing is motion detection. A bug will fly by and i get a text its pretty impressive at night!!",5,1,2018-8-21,1,2,0
"Great price, right?!  Picture quality good.  Wish it could see through glass at night (downside, not good at that keeping it indoors but looking out front door); it works well during the day doing that, though.  You have to keep it plugged in but saves on batteries or running out.  Various mounting options.  The different ""zones"" it can watch/avoid is helpful.I realllllly love the software update where it can alert you if a person is detected (not just motion); and, yes, it's really quite good at knowing the difference.  It didn't have the ""person"" feature when I purchased it so firmware upgrades by a dynamic company have made it better than when I got it.  That made phone alerts easier to tweak and there's even sensitivity settings that help with that some as well.",5,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0
"This is my 3rd or 4th Wyze Cam and for the price you can't beat them. Small, compact, good wireless range and easy to setup and access from the Wyze app from anywhere. The first one of these I purchased was meant to be used to watch my doorstep for Amazon package theft but, ironically, the package containing the camera was stolen. So, I did what anyone would do...I immediately ordered another and have been using it ever since.For their purpose the picture quality is good and the sound quality is average but at $25 they're above and beyond what I expected. My only real issue with them, and it has happened on all of them so far, is the night vision sensor. If it's dark it works as intended but during the day the sensors just keep clicking between night vision on and night vision off. Constantly. Which isn't a horrible issue but if you're near it the audible ""click"" it makes when switching back and forth can be rather annoying.",4,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"I never got a baby monitor with the camera because first of all the cheapest ones have terrible pictures, and the expensive ones have a better picture but they’re almost $200, and we live in a 1200 square-foot apartment and I figured we didn’t need it as this was our second baby. But now that our baby is almost a year old we knew we needed something because every time we went to go check on him when we close the door even at the gentlest it would wake him up.  So I decided to get a cheap one way baby monitor so I could continuously hear sound, but also I wanted a visual so we could check on him periodically without going into the room. This camera is amazing! The picture quality is fantastic, if we leave our baby with anybody we can make sure that he’s in bed on time, these cameras are so great I want to get one for our older kids room, and one for our living room so when we leave we can make sure all our animals are OK, and we can check  on our older child without having disrupt his patter by us going in the room (he’s ASD and it helps to have a constant  view of him)",5,1,2019-9-10,1,0,1
I guess not all 1080p video is the same. I have this camera in an outdoor enclosure and use it outdoors. Compared to my Circle view camera (I uploaded an image of both cameras) the picture quality is not that great. However the software is very useful and just as reliable as any camera. Motion detection works well during the day. So for the price this has to be the best value on the market but not the best camera.  5 stars for value. 3 stars for picture and video quality. I do recommend this camera as a budget alternative.,4,1,2020-8-25,1,1,1
Works as expected for the price.I’ve had issues with the mounting. The metal plate it comes with doesn’t have any mounting hardware so I was unable to find a screw or nail that didn’t obstruct the mounting of the camera to the plate. I used the double sided tape but it ended up peeling off the wall within a day.,4,1,2019-10-29,1,0,1
"On its own, it is a very useful camera with good image quality and surprisingly good sound recording. However, its true usefulness shows when paired with a MicroSD card to allow access to longer recordings than just the short clips that get uploaded to the free cloud service. The only things missing for me are the ability to monitor the video using a desktop and an easier way to get recording off the cameras. However, given the price point, those are things I am more than happy to live with, in exchange for the ability to afford good, well-built, cameras for all the parts of my home that I want to be able to monitor, including my laundry room, because I am a lazy american who doesn't like to walk all the way to the back of the house to see if my clothes are dry. :-P",5,1,2018-12-24,1,1,0
"I have the camera and the chinese version by Xiaomi.  This one is better in terms of the software used and wifi connectivity.  On the chinese one, connection to the camera would drop all the time, on this, no issues!It's small enough to put almost anywhere, and you can buy outdoor cases for this if you want to mount it outdoors.  Everything runs off a single USB cable.",4,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"With all the package stealings and scary stuff that goes on just at our front door, this cam buys a small amount of security. Set up took some time between scanning the code from my phone to entering the Wi-Fi password. After five attempts, I lucked out by resetting the small button inside the Wyze camera. There's no option for a 90 degree setup but I was able to use the built in swivel to point it towards the front of the house. I turned off the Night Vision IR Lights because the cam is setup behind a glass window to remove reflection. I'll update how that looks later. I'm fairly pleased with it although the detections were too frequent. I managed to control that under Advanced settings and setting up a detection range to avoid passing cars. With sound detection for fire alarm, I think this works for under $25! I will likely get another one for the backyard!  I installed a SD card for the option of all day recording but the sensors will automatically record 12 seconds of anything that triggers the cam. Not too shabby! All in all, this is an affordable step to managing front door calamities!",5,1,2019-8-24,1,0,1
"Got the camera today, however...  I cannot get the app to install on my Android phone. It just sits and spins until it times out.Failing to get it installed on my phone I went looking for an app for windows only to find that one must install something called the BlueStack emulator and then download the Wyze Cam app to that.  BlueStack consumes over 2GB of disk space and does not exactly load very quickly.  I've got a 3GHz PC with 16GB of RAM.  I should say it loads way too slow to be convenient just to take a peek at my driveway.  I can walk to the other end of the house and back faster.  On top of this the application would not download and install in BlueStack.",1,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
"This is not a good product for the price. It is an amazing product period and on top of it the price is amazing. This company is giving more in return of what you pay for. This little and powerful camera has everything. This company listen to the client and deliver. They also do regular upgrades to the software giving you more more and even more. You can’t go wrong with this purchase. It works with Alexa google and IFTTT. So you can set the camera to be turned on and start sending you notification when you are not at home and to turn it off and stop notification when you are at home. On top of it it has person detection. Yes! Person detection diferent from motion detection so you can get 2 diferent kind of notifications when you dog or cat is moving around the house or when the delivery guy enter you front yard.

We love this inexpensive indoor camera. It integrates with Alexa very nice and can be setup with several home automation routines. We have been using it to keep an eye on our dog when we are out of the house. We also purchased the Wyze sense bridge that attaches to this camera to use door sensors and motion sensors and everything works excellent together. Planning on buying a few more of these powerhouse cameras to install in other areas of the house. The night vision is excellent as is the picture quality for daytime use. The app is designed very well and there are hardly any delays when viewing live view. The company provides a lot of updates and seems to care a lot about their product and customers and I am looking forward to the other devices from this company in the future.,5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"It is doing what I need it to do, use it for watching dog walker (use a service so I don't know the person who comes in, the service does have insurance but is rather be sure they are treating house and dog with care) interface and set up isn't easily accessible. I can handle most IT issues myself but took more work than I thought it should take. I think some average people would have difficulty setting up. The ""rules"" aren't clear on how to use them and set up, they also don't always work. Wish it had more easy way to set up and say I only want it to run from xyz time to xyz time, but you can't it will not let you turn off alerts from 10pm to 7am. You can only do one day 12am to 12am, so you have to set up two ""rules"" turn off alerts from 12am to 7am and than 10 pm to 11:59 pm.",4,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"Worked okay until I upgraded to a newer Netgear router. Both cameras went off line which would be expected. Tried multiple times to connect to the new router with no success. The yellow light on both cameras came on solid for a few seconds, but never flashed to show they were ready to be setup.  Tried to contact Wyze for help, also with no success. Only contact is by email and then automatic suggestions showed up telling me what to try on my Asus router. WTF kind of help is that? I don't have an Asus router and never have. The cameras are going in the trash. The Wyze, so called support, sucks. Part of the reason for the two stars is because of the lack of support from Wyze.  Maybe they are afraid to talk to someone on the phone. Cheap cameras apparently equal no phone calls.",2,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"I didn't expect much for 25 bucks. It was a test. Unusable for anything except watching a door to see if there is activity. Or watching a countertop looking for your cat. So far I can only view it on my phone via andriod app, which does nothing for me. I need to integrate into my home security system. Also has a lot of bending of the image the farther you go out from the center. But it is clear. Amazing actually for 25 bucks.

"I bought this camera for monitoring my hedgehog's cage to check for abnormal behavior and just to see what she gets up to when I'm sleeping or not there.As far as set-up goes, I liked setting up the Wyze camera better than setting up my Nest cameras. The Nest cameras required having enough light and no shadows to scan a QR code sticker on the camera. Setting up the Wyze camera scanned a QR code that your phone puts out, making it that much easier. The Wyze camera only operates on 2.4GHz wireless frequencies and not the 5GHz. I thought this was going to be an issue because I have a wireless network that puts out both signals with the same name and, therefore, I can only select that name and not choose the 2.4GHz to set that one specifically and I have run into issues in the past with cheaper smart home devices that only operate on 2.4GHz. Instead, I just wasn't connected to the wireless, typed the SSID name and the password, and it connected up without a hitch! If only the smart plugs would connect that easily!",5,1,2020-2-3,1,1,1

The forth should be in Monday and will have it setup same day.I new to IP/security cameras (these are my first attempt) and spend about 30 minutes setting up and playing with the first one and then about 10 minutes on the other 2.  They couldn't be easier to install and get working on the Wyze app and on TinyCam Pro.  I set up 2 of the cameras at the lake house today after the internet installer left the house. Once again setup was 10 minutes top and had them working on Wyze and TinyCam.  Since I had tested these at home, I found it easier to delete them from my home network and just add them again to the new network.  Worked great.",5,1,2019-4-13,1,0,0

"I really wanted to like this product a lot. A friend of mine purchased them, I've seen them in use in multiple businesses. The reviews are decent! However. I have a couple big gripes that the Blink systems (by Amazon) for example, don't have. The first big one is no matter what setting I use for motion detection, there's no option to filter out if it's just light, or just to record motion when a person is detected. I live next to a busy road in my town and the lights from cars at night set the motion off every minute or two, when there's light from a car. Even when I set the detection boundaries, it still catches motion and records it even though it's somehting I don't want to see. Unfortunately at the same time, people detection with these cameras seems horrible. First, you have to have the motion detection on in order for your cameras to detect a person, and I can not say how many times I've walked into the camera frame, in different times of the day, different angles, etc where it only detections motion, not a person. This feature seems to be in extreme forms of infancy, and needs a lot of work.Second is the recording. These cameras record about 10-15 second clips of scenarios that it is set to record. The only continuous recording you get is if you install an SD card and even then the recording is eaten up quickly (I've tried and 8gb card) and didn't record much until it filled up.",3,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"Been a good camera so far, just a few things though, you can hear the relay of the camera when it switches to and from night mode, the camera gets slightly warm but not a concern, the data band width isn’t the best but useable, on my camera in the top left corner I got a few green pixels (defective camera?), wattage isn’t bad but if you are going to outfit your home it does add up, 5 watts per cam which is about an LED light bulb on 24/7... the voice talking is poor audio speaker in camera but to be expected at this price point, the transition from bright to dark to bright I found to be acceptable, I thought it allowed the brightness to progress each way a bit too far before transitioning, but better than going back and forth continuously.All in all, very easy to set up good video, great price, and great use for remote monitoring... I would buy again and have no intentions of returning this one...",4,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0

"I had a package stolen off my porch and decided I wanted to be able to keep a better eye on the situation. I know this says it’s an indoor camera, but it’s magnetic on the bottom and sticks perfectly to my front door, looking out the screen door so it’s protected. Awesome. It even comes with a metal plate and double stick tape to mount it anywhere. Also very cool. It is very easy to set up, you just download an app, scan a QR code and you’re done!The best thing about this is the picture quality. The attached photo is of me, screenshot from the app. It saves 12 second clips when motion is detected or noise is heard, and you can choose either one or both. I don’t have it alert me to noises, being outside and all, but I can see why that would be good inside. I can turn the camera off from the app. You can also talk through the camera via app. I wouldn’t say it’s a great alternative to a video doorbell, but if you can catch the mailman while he’s still there, it’s no problem to tell him to leave your stuff in a particular spot.",5,1,2019-3-8,1,0,1
"Really good video during the day time but the infrared night vision isn’t strong enough. It’s very dim at night, you won’t be able to see very clearly if the unit is 6ft above the floor. Unit disconnects and has trouble reconnecting sometimes despite a stable and fast internet connection. Sometimes I have to restart the app 5x before the camera connects. The camera is also susceptible to ppl simply pressing the reset button as it resets when the button is pressed, you don’t even need to hold the button to reset it. While the video is crips and clear in HD & SD, the microphone is very bad and the speaker seems to be a bit too loud. The magnetic base is very useful and I like how it can be rotated. The iPhone app for the camera is also very well polished. UI is user friendly and simple. The detection zone, CO, and smoke features are also a plus; these features aren’t common in much pricier security cameras. Overall this product is good for its price, beats everything else on the market but improvements are a must. Hopefully a software patch can fix the connection issues. The audio quality problems can be tolerated.",3,1,2019-2-16,1,0,0
"It is almost too good to be true that you can buy a 1080p motion sensing, night vision (too) camera that even has free 14 day storage on Wyze's servers. Why am I paying $30 a year for Ring cameras to store my videos? I wish I had already bought this camera when someone broke into my house a year ago. I worry that this company may someday go out of business which would make the camera useless if I can't access the videos. I hope that doesn't happen. I actually bought this camera to look in on my 2 cats when I am not home. There is a live view and Event view. So far, I never see the cats triggering any events even though I am sure they have been near the camera many times. It is only triggered when people walk by. I would like to be able to adjust the settings to have the cats trigger events. If I look in on the live view and a cat is sleeping on the sofa or chair or just in the room, I can see it. The video is good quality and I can share videos using email or texts, etc. It will also download videos to my Photos app on the device I am using. I have an iPad and an iPhone, each with its own app. I would love it if there was an app or website that I could also access the videos from my camera from my desktop computer.",4,1,2019-5-4,1,0,1
"I bought this camera even AFTER I read the reviews about it sending video to China or whatever... I install cameras almost every day and I rarely ever install indoor cameras. Whenever I do install indoor cameras throughout a house, it just seems really creepy to me. It is becoming a little more popular with dog owners who want to be able to yell at their dogs for jumping on the couch. You should assume any camera in your house can watch you or be hacked at any time. I even cover my laptop cameras and lots of people do too.With that being said, I bought this camera because 1, it's very cheap and 2, I just need a camera I can aim at my apartment  door in case anybody breaks in. I would only use this camera, or any camera that can be seen online, for that purpose. I wouldn't set this camera up in places I plan to walk around naked or wouldn't want my privacy invaded. If a little creep in China wants to watch me walk into my apartment every day, I don't really care.",4,1,2019-2-22,1,0,0
"I purchased this because reviewers stated it could be used without buying a subscription.  After using the 14 day free trial (which worked well) the unit would not record events to the inserted memory card. If I set the camera to record continously and then closed the app it would not record. While in the app, I could take pictures or record and it would record to the card. But, no matter what settings I changed the camera would not continously record. I have since subscribed and the camera works as expected. This camera has to have wifi to communicate to the app. The reason I had bought the camera was that many reviews stated the camera would function without wifi and subscription, however, it does NOT operate with all the functions without them (motion detection, recording,  etc.). Because the camera is a wifi camera it would be easy for others to name the signal making it useless. I have encountered several times when the camera could not connect.  So basically the camera does not work as expected, however,  this camera falls into a price range that made it affordable.",3,1,2020-4-7,1,0,0
"So, I've tried several brand cameras over the years, and this one takes the cake.  First, the cost, are you kidding me on how long the cost is for this???  For the money, there is no other camera on the market that can compete.  And their website and videos, very entertaining!  Super fast to set up!  Plug it in, download the app, the app finds the camera, go through the 1 minute set up and your done.  Currently running a 32gig micro SD card and on 1080p, I get 3 days of constant recording.  On 720p, I get about 7 days.  From what I understand, the company states that 32gig is as big as it will accept, but I've read others have gotten a 64gig micro SD to work, but I haven't tried it.  This camera is light, small and easy to put anywhere.  I currently have it setup at my front door as i have a nice overhang and it went through some very cold weather this winter and never skipped a beat.  The play back from the app is great and pulls up quickly and skimming through the saved data is pretty quick.  There are two drawbacks from this camera, that I'm hoping for them to be addressed as the company grows.  The first is record on motion.  This works well, however, it only records on motion every 5 minutes.  So, it will begin recording, show a 30 second clip and will not again motion record for another 5 minutes.  It does still continuously record, so you do have the footage, I more just wish you could customize this setting so that maybe you could be alerted more or less depending on the motion time range you could set, which currently isn't an option.  The other drawback is data backup.  Currently, from the manufacture this isn't possible.  Ideally, if they offered cloud storage, that would be awesome.  Maybe one week or 30 days or a paid subscription for how long you'd want them to keep it.  Or I would actually be ok if they let you select a backup location to a NAS or network hard drive.  My fear, with my camera just sitting on a ledge by my front door, or even if you had it inside your home.  If the bad guy sees the camera, unplugs it and takes it with him, now he has all the data and you have nothing for the authorities so he gets away.  Even if you have multiple cameras, if he takes them all, you have no proof or image if him to turn over in hopes to getting him caught.  Overall, the best camera on the market for the money and the company is young so I'm hoping as they grow and take in feedback, these features will be added soon enough!",5,1,2019-5-24,1,1,1
"I have tried several SD cards in here and they just fly out of the slot, so cannot record anything,  i push them in and they pop right back out.  otherwise the camera works fine in real time but want recordings and playback on this kind of renders it useless if cant record with the SD card put in.",3,1,2020-3-20,1,2,0
"Wyze is a company with their headquarters in the USA and everything about this camera is superior to all the no-name Chinese cameras. The setup is seamless, the extending tilt base and magnetic mount are genius, the apps work seamlessly, and the image quality is outstanding. At this price point and size it's nothing short of amazing. Perhaps even more significant many Chinese cameras have been shown to ""phone home"" sending images to China and/or they have deliberate insecure ""back doors"" allowing others to view your camera from anywhere in the world. That's not the case here. This camera can even work on a local network with no access to the internet storing events on a microSD card instead of in the cloud.

"I love this product so much that I have 2 of these and the one that pans. I ordered them to help record and monitor my child's seizures and they are small and easy to setup. If you don't want to use the magnetic plate that comes with it, you can use command strips to stick the camera where you like. There is a delay on the HD setting but if you switch it to the 360 setting, it's only a 2 second 1-2 second delay which is okay for me. You can buy an SD card for video storage and put it in the back of the camera. The picture quality is great on both settings and this device's price point is another reason why I went with this camera. I love that you can add multiple cameras at once and you can view the camera from your phone anywhere even outside or on the go. I've had baby monitors that did okay but the fact you can view this from you phone is even better. I reccomend buying it and trying it out. You don't like it....send it back.",5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0

I know it's a new feature but its weak right now. It maybe detects a person 20% of the time.

How cool is that?!  If you need pan and tilt, Wyze makes one of those too for just a little more.  Wyze is a great company that keeps updating its products.  Only con I have is they need to include days of the week for scheduling, rather than just hours of the day.

"This is a pretty impressive piece of kit.  Wyze has taken good quality hardware (made by Xiaomi) and written some quality software to make a compelling package.  I've set a ton of IP cameras over the years and this was by far the most painless installation even.  Less than five minutes from opening the box I had the camera up and running.  The video quality is good both during the day and in darkness.  I don't need the motion sensing parts for my application so I didn't test those.  That brings me to the downside...  this sends all your imagery off to servers around the world.  Some have pretty interesting IPs.  I haven't gone forensic but some people have and they were less than impressed.  I'm using this to see what my cats are doing when I'm not home so I don't really care about ultimate privacy from the camera.  There's no way I'd set this up in any other part of my house though.

As per Wyze documentation, the event and continuous recording should work with a local micro SD card, and never need cloud subscription. But it does not do.I have one friend who uses V1 camera and apparently it seems to working for him with local micro SD card. However, the one I have is V2 card and it does not work for me.

"Let me start off by saying I purchase this as a security camera for the pool in the backyard. I know there's lots of reviews that already cover the glare from the IR sensors reflecting back at the device from an interior window looking outside at night; I took the chance anyways because I wasn't sure how bad it was. and as it turns out, it's bad..really bad. In my case, all I saw was 4 cascading bright dots and a halo, so if you're looking to buy this and use it to monitor something outside from within your house through a window using the ""night"" mode as intended, then you should stop here and pass on the device. It is made for inside use only and night mode will never work through a window.With all that said, I'm not dinging it for the risk I was willing to take going into buying this.

"Overall good and easy to set up.Worst part- reviewing video is really bad without a fast-forward (watching in 2x, 5x...etc) does not exist.  You can manually move the sliding timeline but extremely sensitive and nearly impossible to look for something that only takes up about 5 -10 seconds of a clip (for instance if someone walks by the camera).  The discussion boards by Wyze company says they are looking into making a 2x, 10x playback but they have been saying that for over a year.",3,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
I really liked this camera when started using. I can track and see instantly who was at the camera by clicking Event. It only shows 12 seconds of movie clip in each motion but it dose the job in most of my case just wanted to know who is at my door way. However I lowered my overall rating from 5 to 2 when I discovered Wyze notification sound can not be changed for good reason. I have 2 Wyze cams installed at front and back door but I have no way to know from notification which door cam just sent me a notification on my iPhone X while some other wifi cams can do that.I research it and found out Wyze never worked and satisfied users in later firmware over years.  I also started hating the default (only available) Tri-Tone notification sound. It is too intense and not sophisticated to hear all the times. I will upgrade my rating once Wyze dose it!,2,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"I was skeptical over this camera based on the price. But I wanted an inexpensive camera to monitor a remodel project in an outbuilding on our property (didn't want to lose tools!). I purchased this camera and it's been exceptional! I had no problems setting it up. Wifi from the house isn't spectacular, but this little guy had no problems connecting and staying connected. Alerts were sometimes slow at first, but I noticed considerably faster alerts when I finally put an access point for my wifi in the building, so I think it was more of a problem with my wifi coverage than the camera. The sound alerts are great, I get an alert when it hears someone at the door unlocking it, long before I get an alert on the motion. Night vision is ok, but it doesn't reach very far. This camera is pretty tough. I accidentally knocked it off the shelf it was sitting on. It didn't miss a beat and had no damage. If you have a large area to cover with night vision, this little camera may not be adequate enough, but if you have a small area to monitor or night vision isn't that big of a deal to you, then I highly recommend this camera as an expensive security camera. My wish is integration with Alexa or ONVIF compatibility, but at this price I wouldn't expect it.",5,1,2018-2-8,1,1,0
"Let me start by saying that for the price, this camera can’t be beat. The camera itself is small and very light weight. The stand/legs can collapse or raise the camera by a few inches. The image quality is as good or better than my expensive Infant Optix video monitor. The night vision is definitely superior. We use this as a monitor in my 3 year olds bedroom mostly for nap time/when she’s going to bed (to make sure she actually goes to sleep). We bought it primarily for travel so we wouldn’t have to pack our other baby monitor and camera. It’s great because it’s so lightweight and small and we can just toss the camera + cord in our bag and then the app on our phone allows us to view the camera which is convenient with how much travel we do. Another feature we love is that it can take photo and video and save them.There are only a couple things that we feel are negative about this camera. The sound delay drives me crazy. While it is pretty clear for the most part, the sound has about a 3 second delay in both receiving and in the talk back feature. It’s also like a walk-in-talkie in that if my daughter starts talking while I’m already talking to her on it then I don’t hear what she says. The volume of the microphone seems to have one volume... loud. I’ve tried to figure out how to turn the volume down but haven’t been able to find any kind of settings for that, so when my daughter is upstairs and I’m downstairs, I can hear my voice clear as day through the camera when i talk to her. I also find that you need to keep your finger on the microphone button for about 3 seconds after you finish speaking or your audio on the other end gets cut off (so I guess the only perk of the volume being so loud is that I can hear when my audio has been received by the camera so I know when to release). The only other negative about this camera is that if you are using it as say a baby monitor like we do, you have to have your phone unlocked and the app open to receive alerts on sound. If your phone is locked it won’t alert you to the sound... so we don’t plan to use this as a baby monitor when our second child arrives - but for our toddlers room it’s perfect.",4,1,2018-12-30,1,0,0
"I like these little cameras but the app isn't very user friendly. I cannot figure out how to get it to notify me if there is motion and nobody sits and stares at their phone screen all day too see if there is any activity. They don't come with an SD card so you can't record without one so that's a separate purchase.  And you have to manually hit record for it to actually record.The other thing that's inconvenient, is it is not cordless. That's fine for indoors but i realized fast that mounting a camera outside is difficult for me since i only have one outdoor outlet and even if i could plug into that one outlet, the cord is way too short so an extension cord would have to be used. I had to get creative and plug it inside my home with and extension cord so it looks really rigged. I had to tape the cord up around my door frame and since the cord is so short the extension cord plug end sits half way up my wall on the inside.  Taped there, very unsightly. Anyways. The camera work fine but i wish i would've paid a little more for a cordless system. I have learned.  Thank you.",3,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0
"I waited a few months before writing this review. First the video quality even in ""HD"" (HD?) is awful, you can't read a license plate from 10ft (3M) away; never less a person face. The playback function is totally useless, try finding a 10 seconds event in 2 hours of recording video, seems the developers want us to sit for the whole time and re-watch it in real time, why not 2x, 3x and more speed playback?I bought the optional memory but in many occasions the camera just refused to record the streaming, I have to ""Restart Device"" at least twice to get this function to work.If you intend to use it in 10x10 room it might be ok, but forget fron/back yards, driveway or any bigger than a room place. But you still have the limitations stated above.",1,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
Amazing amount of features and quality for such a small price so far it seems to be Dependable the second I open my door I get a notification on my phone without fail the night vision is good picture quality is amazing day or night I have more features with this product then you get when you spend hundreds of dollars buying an Arlo And there's no monthly fee and if it dies in 6 months who cares it was only $25 I am absolutely shocked on how many features I have and the quality for that kind of price I wasn't expecting much when I bought this I just wanted something for my security I never thought I would get something that is comparable if not better than Arlo I understand people spend hundreds of dollars on one camera or two with Arlo but they're paying for the longevity of a product that will last for a very long time I'm assuming that this may not last forever but like I said who cares it's only $25,5,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"These little cameras are amazing! Super fast and easy set-up, affordable enough to purchase multiple units, small enough to place somewhat inconspicuously throughout the house, and the app is very user-friendly! I was pleasantly surprised at the great quality of the video in both light and dark conditions. The cams come with 14 days of free recording which is great because that gives you time to order compatible SD cards for your cams (that's what I did). I purchased three ""Fatty Dove"" 32 GB SD cards for about $8 each and they were a breeze to snap into the bottom of each camera. They synced with the touch of a button and I was even able to link the cams to my Amazon Echo devices so I can just say ""Alexa, show me the kitchen"", etc. and see it on my Amazon Echo Show screen. The little gray base and arm on each camera make it a breeze to adjust the height and tilt of the cameras too. I used a different brand before and everything about it was complicated.  So for me, the ease-of-use with Wyze can't be beat. I plan to order three more!",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
"Pros: Affordable, user-friendly software that supports multiple devices, easy to set up, works with Alexa and recently started Google assistance support, seemingly great customer supportCons: People have concerns with these cameras being hacked so a huge privacy issue. Google assistance support isn't fully functional yet. The 3M tape/magnetic mount seems smart at first but it doesn't stay on the wall. It is also very prone of falling when the wire is pulled, especially if the power source is near the floor and camera is mounted high above [Think an active child who loves to pull the wire]. The AC brick is too bulky that a flat profile would be better -- I'm in search of an alternative for this. My biggest disappointment by far is that I am not receiving notifications upon sound/motion detection. I have followed their customer support advices but still nothing to this day.",3,1,2019-7-11,1,0,0

I can help/ monitor while getting to/from work -home, Very easy set up. My Father is elderly and I set up a few in his house and we can communicate easily, I can monitor who comes and goes /Nurses or visiting friends. The volume is good to hear two way conversation. Crisp detail for the price is an excellent parent or care giver friendly tool. I paired it w my Alexa/Echo and on my iPhone i get notifications when motion occurs.

"I have been adding these to my network since I bought my first one a while back.  They are so inexpensive, that you can pretty much stick them anywhere.  They have onboard storage via micro SD card, live multiple cam view with their app from your phone and free cloud storage that will hold a week of video at a time.  They only need a power supply (ie plug) to work, no video cables needed and use your WiFi network to broadcast feed.  I was worried that for the price, these would feel cheap and plasticy, but in all honesty, these remind me of something Apple would produce.  Kind of heavy feeling and really high quality construction.  The video quality is adjustable to work with different network bandwidths and the picture is hi def.  I have one mounted outside under the front porch and use a little plastic weather resistant case (although this is not recommended by the manufacturer) and it works great.  The night vision is excellent too!  These are overall exceptional security cameras and I would dare say they are easily on par with systems like Ring and Nest cams.  I have both the stationary cams and pan and tilt.  Very happy with these, you really can’t go wrong with this purchase!",5,1,2019-7-19,1,0,1

Cameras are easy to set up, the app works well especially considering the features that are free. The picture quality is pretty good.

All doing a great job of what I was hoping them to do. I have the sensor kit installed as well with the motion detector and door/window contacts all working great. The app easily organizes each one and does a great job of notifying me when in senses activity. Plan to add a couple more cameras soon. Very interested in the new door lock they just unveiled.",5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"There are some things I like about these cameras and several things I don't like. I have 4 of them. The price is right. You don't have to pay a monthly subscription price and they will stream to a cloud which provides two weeks of free storage, and then overwrites itself. The cloud is only for the short bursts of recording when the camera senses movement. You can pay for storage of longer clips when the camera senses movement. You can adjust the sensitivity so it isn't recording every time the wind blows, but if you reduce the sensitivity too much it won't turn on when a car is right in front of your home. You can also purchase an SD card for additional storage and the ability to review the entire footage, if needed. They are good quality for detail on footage less than 25 feet away, so perfect for someone coming up to your front/back door. They also have mic and a speaker so you can use them to talk with someone on the porch.There are some things I don't like. The camera lenses aren't good enough to identify a license plate or detailed facial features 30-50 feet away. They aren't weatherproof. Although I do have one outside under my eave that is somewhat protected from the elements and it has been okay so far. The night vision could be better. The camera outside has slightly better night vision, but it would still be difficult to make out detail of a persons facial features. If you have the night vision on behind glass you get a reflection. Also, I notice when it is recording movement sometimes the cameras freeze up, which is frustrating if there is critical footage you are trying to watch/review. When rewinding the SD card footage, it can be difficult to get to the exact time frame you are looking for, because the timeline to review footage is touchy and skips around or buffers and then goes back to the end of the footage.  I wish they could come up with software that could take you to the exact time you are seeking. Also, every time they have updates, there are several issues and bugs. I wish they would thoroughly test the firmware and software updates before release. I am not going to update my cameras anymore if I have a stable version of the firmware and app because the new updates are riddled with problems. Their support team are of no help. They run you through all sorts of useless steps that don't help because it is really a firmware issue. Also, I wish they would build a feature into the app that you can easily go back to an older firmware version, if the update is buggy/has issues (which seems to be the case most of the time).",3,1,2018-12-13,1,0,0
"The Wyze camera is an awesome affordable camera. It comes with micro usb cord, 3M adhesive round with a round metal Wyze plate. It is very easy to install it does not take long to get it connected to your Wifi after that you can name your camera. For example, front door or garage what ever your flavor. Here are some things that can be problematic. While setting up if you hear something like, ""Cannot find the specified network"" it is probably because there is a 5G connection.  I found out that some 5G networks will not get recognized all you have to do is change it to the 2G. Boom problem solved. Micro usb cord is not long enough you can buy extenders and it will not bother image quality. Last but not least right after the camera is set up you might have to do the upgrade/update to the system so that you can gain access to some other features of the camera.Overall my opinion is I LOVE THIS CAMERA!

"I had been watching Wyze for a while, trying to decide whether to buy a couple of cameras. I finally decided to try two of them, and they work well. One is indoors; one is outdoors in a sheltered place. Both work well and I managed to get them integrated with IFTTT. I haven't used all the features yet (e.g., two-way voice) but I'm sure as I get used to them it will prove handy. I'm waiting eagerly for the development of a solar-powered one for my front door. My other wish, ones that will work at night from inside a window, has been granted with upgrades to the app and I'll be buying more to monitor what goes on outside the windows.I don't have a sophisticated setup, and I don't need a lot of security.

"The most Awesome security system sold at a great price through Amazon.  works better than unit costing over $100.  the unit is small and unnoticeable when put in the right place.  the unit is very stable for i've run it straight for 3mths with absolutely no problems.  the unit is packed with high end feature.  the motion control works the best and allows you to modify the area to be detected my the motion sensor to keep from picking up every movement in the room.  when you leave your house you go into device notifications a edit and select all and delete the recording of you in the house.  once you leave and you get a notification on your phone which can be put in ""push mode""  you will be instantly notified by the Wyze cam phone app so you can view the 12sec clip of who has entered your house in 720 video resolution allowing you to get a great picture of who the intruder is to take to authorities.  it has other detection features such as sound as wll as if you detect someone to can turn on the microphone a speak to the intruder if you wish.  set up is incredible easy and take 5mins to set up and the phone app uses a three stage verification that id's your phone which makes it pretty safe from hackers.  for $25.00 it's beats units costing close to $100 bucks ,  the only minor flaw i've found is it has trouble picking up brown clothes but i have my unit set to detect the entrance hall way so the opening of the door sets it off.  nothing i've seen for this price has  the quality and feature.  i highly recommend this item because it will give you peace of mid security and an incredible price .",5,1,2018-6-6,1,0,0
"This product is the best bang for your buck, and more. Since buying this camera, I have started following Wyze for their developments and I want to purchase everything they have to offer (only if I had all those resources). This camera does way more than expected, and even better, the app is easy to use and aesthetically pleasing. Currently, I use the camera outdoors and it hasn't failed me yet.The only drawbacks are issues with connectivity and outdoor usage. If you do not have reliable WIFI, this is not the camera for you. My internet is constantly unreliable and it frustrates me that it messes with this awesome product. Although I am using it outdoors, I think its best suited indoors. Often times my motion sensor in the camera picks up the little bugs that are attracted to the light in the camera and records that as an event.

"I have this camera set up in an empty rental that is being repaired. I wanted something to keep track of who was entering the property and help prevent theft. It works perfectly for this situation. Since I cannot be there every minute, at least I can monitor what is going on. It has let me track when the repair person showed up and when they left. I can also see if they are working or just standing around. The picture is not as good at night, but to be fair, it is very dark at night and I can at least see motion. Given that this camera is linked to the internet, I fully expect someone to be spying. I would appreciate it if the spy/hacker would figure out the audio, and let the repair person I caught standing there with a beer know that they are fired. If you are going to hack my camera, at least be useful.I have not been able to get the audio to work. It may be me, or it may be the camera, I cannot tell at this point.

Because the camera was white, I also bought the black, silicone skin to help hide the camera. It fits and looks great. HOWEVER I do have one complaint. The motion detection area can only be a single square that you draw. If your camera is in the corner of the room you can only draw a square parallel to your viewing screen and cannot create a diagonal detection area. Wyze needs to allow more than one detection area or the ability to drawa diagonal. If you have an odd shaped area you want motion detected in you cant do it with this camera.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
Wyze biggest drive and focus is selling as many units as they can. With 2018 coming to a close what did they do? Dropped the price to increase sales. Before you buy head over to Wyse Community forums and look at the issues people are having and how long they have been going on without any solutions.

So when you have say 100 recordings a day, deleting events is difficult. I contacted the company to suggest an improvement in the way the app handles deletes and they said it was impossible to improve. If they designed the product so poorly that they cant do better than deleting 20 events in 5 clicks then they need to hire better developers.

"I've had this and some Wyze pan cams for a few Mos now. If the live camera view is Important than forget about these cheap cameras. Too bad because when they work they are fine but they are NOT dependable. I have high speed Internet and high speed tri band router and I still had to drop the cameras to their lowest resolution to reduce the delay in viewing which is now about 4 seconds because it goes out of my home and back via a cloud. The real deal breaker is with Amazon Alexa. The cameras will not stay on no longer than 5 or 10 minutes and 'Alexa Show' goes blank. In the morning Alexa can't find the cameras or just one of the 4. If I keep saying ""show camera"" one eventually it will show. So full time live monitoring is out of the question and access is via some cloud somewhere (not direct locally). Not dependable. I love the camera itself, the price, the size etc BUT you can NOT depend on it to be available when you need it.

"I got this to aim at my front door, it has a nice wide angle so it actually picks up my entire living room. It’s great so I can check in on my dog when I’m away.

It has smoke alarm detection as well as regular sound detection, I keep the smoke alarm detection on, but turn off the regular sound detection since my neighbor constantly sets it off with his door slamming. The motion detection has improved significantly since I purchased this, a tiny fruit fly no longer sets of the motion detection. The company keeps making improvements and it has gotten updates over the months. The app is clean and easy to use (iPhone and iPad apps, I haven’t tried android), it’s easy to find settings and the video quality is pretty much on par with the $100+ range cameras, the audio is nothing to write home about, but I don’t mind. I love the magnetic bottom, it makes it very versatile for placement, it’s lightweight but not cheap, and it has many different angles (there’s an option to flip the screen in the app if you want to mount it upside down). What ultimately sold me was the lack of a subscription fee for storage. I wish there was an option to have it record longer clips, I wouldn’t mind if it caused me to lose older clips to do this.

"Considering the price, there are a lot of things to really like about this camera. Good Image, easy setup, easy to use. UNFORTUNATELY I have two big problems with it. For one, I can't get SD Cards to work in either camera and I've tried both the Wyze SD card and another similar one I already had. Neither are read by the camera (and yes I have it installed correctly and have tried multiple times). Another problem is that it only records in 12 second bursts without an SD card. This can be helpful but if you have a significant event like someone breaking into your home or vandalizing something you likely won't see enough of the event because once a 12 second burst records it seems to take a while before motion triggers another 12 second recording. I'm using mine in part so I can look in on my house from my phone while on vacation although be warned you may burn up a lot of data if not on wifi. All in all, I'm not going to return them because they will still be better than not having any monitoring but it's disappointing they did so many things right but couldn't quite ensure some of the most important aspects worked right.",3,1,2018-12-20,1,0,0
"I had high hopes for this camera, but it was a complete disappointment.  The set-up was overly complicated because you couldn't really complete the setup until you upgraded the firmware.

Once I was on the latest firmware and I got everything working, I thought the camera was great for the first several hours until it just stopped working.  My wifi strength was excellent in that room, by the way.  The camera would just stop capturing motion events or would just go offline for no reason whatsoever.  If you unplugged it and plugged it back in, it would reconnect and work great for a few more hours.  But it would always die within a few hours, guaranteed.

"I bought this to replace my Xiaomi Yi cam. I have two Yi cams but one of them cannot be connected after power outage. Paring Yi cam is little frustrated. So I decided to buy another one and try out Wyze. Having another cam I can easily to compare them. The two cams have similar functionality and pairing mechanism is almost same. However, paring for Wyze is much faster even with little hiccups that you may need to try couple times. The picture quality is decent. I set mine to HD but you have choice of SD or 360 so you can save more space in the card. I rather have better quality in case something happens and I will be able to see. It can detect not only motion, but also sound and then auto record. One huge upside is Wyze records 12 seconds of clip when motion is detected instead of 6 seconds in Yi cam. You can't see much with only 6 seconds and this is another main reason I'm not buying Yi cam anymore. Basically, Wyze is similar to Yi cam but better in every category and I do recommend this product for anyone who is looking for simple solution for in-home security camera. Because it's working well, I just bought another one!",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"Setup was a breeze. I added an SD card to keep recording local, no issues at all. WiFi was not fast enough and had to drop resolution to SD level but still has no issue. The issues began when you need to record based on a motion detected. Numerous bugs was found and the company is not responsive to any of the reported issue. First of all, motion coming from the left starts recording immediately. Motions from the right, does not trigger recording until the subject (causing the motion detection) is way past half the screen. When another motion occurred right after a motion was detected and recording stopped, the camera failed to detect the motion at all. For example, if someone walked in front of the house (triggering a recording), if this individual goes into your garage (the recording would stop around this time), if he immediately pull out with a car, this even does not trigger motion recording at all.",2,1,2019-6-9,1,0,0
"Based on a friend's recommendation I gave the Wyze Cam a try.  I'm not a novice camera owner.  I've owned and installed Hikvision and Axis cameras.  Those are commercial grade cameras and are not easy to install.  I will have to say that the Wyze Cam is a breeze to install compared to the other commercial grade cameras I own.  The setup was very easy.  Download the app, set up an account, follow the instructions and in less than 5 minutes your Wyze Cam is onlinel.  The picture quality is excellent.  You can switch between HD and SD if you need to.  That also will allow you to save data on the MicroSD card.The only issue I have had is there is with a recent firmware update.  This update was to allow to be notified of only 'person only' motion.  It has worked for a while but lately the Wyze Cam I have in the garage is not always picking up 'person only' motion.  I would give it 5 stars if not 'person only' motion issue.",4,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"First, I bought it because someone else said they had one and they loved it. I bought it and discovered poor institutions  in the box. You go on line and they will tell you more. I found videos helping me but I had trouble anyway. Seems the limit on the data stream is less than 5G. I did not know this and it did not work. My 5G Wifi was too fast so after cussing a bit I used it at a different location. The second location is very rural and there is Wifi at 2.4G but no cellular coverage. Now I am challenged running it off an app when there is no cellular coverage.  It works some of the time but not well enough to recommend it for anyone.",2,1,2019-9-26,1,1,0
"This little guy makes a outstaning home security cameras at a very low cost. They are small, can be put anywhere and have a picture quality of 1080p. The person tracking on it work better than some expensive brands. They are not exactly waterproof but there are many products on Amazon to make them usable outside. I have gotten feedback from many that have used them outside without any issues for a year now. I have had one outside for a few months and still working strong. For an inexpensive home security camera these are the best and work with many  camera applications like Blue Iris, MotionEye, etc. These little guys are perfect for baby cams, indoor cameras, and more since they are small and lite weight. They have two way communication like the bigger name brands do and integrate will with other Wyze products. The new Sense pairs nice with these cameras and soon the Wyze bulbs will too.",5,1,2019-7-15,1,0,0

"If you don't need support and can troubleshoot on your own this is a great camera.  If you are someone who uses and expects support DO NOT buy Wyze!  I bought 2 of these, when I got the 1st online it asked for a firmware update from ..1.76 to ..2.52 and that made the camera never connect again.  It was usless.  I tried calling support 5x and 2x it said no one here call back, CLICK!  The other 3x I waited on hold 5-10 minutes and then it said no one is here, CLICK!  I emailed them and got the FAQ ""how to connect"" the camera.  I replied and said that is not my issue, my issue is the firmware and it will not work, I tried 3 different versions to flash the camera and no luck!  I even tried to connect it to my PC to try and see if I could access anything...I could not.  They NEVER replied to my email response.The video is great and I picked SD (720) vs HD (1080) just because I wanted to save on space and the 720  looks great!  The sound is so-so and speaking from the mic is so-so but it works and is understandable.  I don't know if I can update the firmware without any issues???",4,1,2018-12-17,1,0,0
I purchased this just to watch my dogs when Im at work because they sometime like to raid the trash. Well after a week of owning it it my dog tried to make a move for the trash. The motion detector sent a notification to my phone and I pulled it up just in time and was able to reprimand her via the voice feature and she left the kitchen all confused!!! it works! exactly what I wanted. love this product.,5,1,2018-12-5,1,3,0
"I LOVE my Wyze cameras! Easy to set up, picture quality is pretty good (especially for the price) and the night vision works excellently. I have had some trouble with the sound as there is a delay but that could be from my subpar WiFi, I don’t actually know. The sound isn’t a huge deal for me for what I use them for though so it isn’t a big deal. I love the free app and ability to record more by adding the micro SD card. I got them even cheaper than normal when they were offered on one of amazons 12 days of deals during the holidays, so the price makes them that much sweeter! They’re a great deal at regular price though too, thanks Wyze and Amazon! Also, it’s worth watching the little review video",5,1,2019-1-11,1,1,0
"I've had a minor issue where the cameras need to be power-cycled pretty often.  That's not ideal as they're installed in places where that's just not quick or easy..not to mention all the downtime I've experienced while at work or whatever and a camera is asking that I power-cycle it.The motion detection is the big gripe here though.  Every little thing sets it off, and turning down the sensitivity just makes it less effective overall.  Car headlights reflecting on the snow.  Lightning.  Bugs.  Falling snow.  Lil specks of dust.  neighbors lights.  Inside lights reflecting on the porch.  Blowing trees.  I mean the list of false-positives goes on and on and on.  I bought 6 of these to replace our Arlo's that have lower resolution, but the Arlo motion detection algorithms are far superior.  With Arlo we'd get maybe 1-2 false positives a day at max.  With Wyze we're getting maybe a 6-12 per day, and on some night, like during the thunderstorm last night, we wake up to a few dozen false notifications.",2,1,2019-3-13,1,0,0
"This seemed to work for a while, recording and all. It randomly stopped sending motion detection notices but whatever. And then suddenly it stopped working altogether. I got it working for about a day but without recording, and now no matter what I do I can’t connect to it. I’m let down because I bought it to monitor package theft on my porch, and the only time I really needed it to work it just wouldn’t. Would not recommend.",1,1,2018-12-20,1,3,0
"I have my camera indoor pointing out to my yard, the camera clearly captured a strange woman in white robe letting her dog do his business in my yard.  I love these small cameras especially with the ability to save locally to memory disk in case of no internet connection.  It can be used as a dash cam - perfect when I don't want to use a windshield suction cup!  Love their 2 way audio microphone functionalities - the only downside is that you can't disable the microphone permanently, however, you can record video without sound.  Also, it works with Kindle via Alexa, Echo Show, Echo Spot, FireTV and phone apps!",5,1,2018-12-2,1,2,0
"For the price, this is an amazing little camera. I currently have it looking out a window. Daytime clarity is great! The motion tracker tracks everything, including swaying leaves.  In this application, the only downside is that with night vision, the infrared lights reflect off the window and the picture is terrible. Indoors, night vision is great! Love the Wizen cam!",5,1,2018-10-19,1,3,0
"For the price, this is a great budget camera.  You should expect to purchase a micro SD card so that you can actually have a recorded rolling history.  I give 4 stars because, although budget, the app could use some work.  It sometimes fails to connect to the camera remotely, even though our WiFi is solid.  Also, the app seems a but buggy.  While it does recognize motion, it would be nice to have a marker on the timeline to denote when there was motion detected to save having to scroll through a lot of video.  I am hoping that with updates, they can improve the software.  But, so far, we are pretty happy with the hardware.  The video is very clear and the night vision works good as well.  However, the microphone is a little too quiet.",4,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"Their app won't allow a cam to connect unless the wireless network has some type of password.  It used to allow for no password - apparently the newest version of the app changed that.

I know it's nice to give people the holiday week off, but from a customer point of view, the day or two after Christmas is likely when we'll need the most support.  It's frustrating.",1,1,2018-12-27,1,1,0
Put these in windows. Disabled the ir made the refection better but can't see without bright lights. I'm now trying to decide between putting an outside camera or some lighting for back yard but front yard has a street light which gives enough light to catch a good picture. The 12 sec capture is good for identification. The pictures are terrific and even clear with night vision. They fit in windows nicely and other small areas. I really like that the light is on back side and not the front. My wi ndows are tinted for heat on inside so I dont have alot if glare just a slight Halo. I have purchased the kit and will try the whole system. I can't stand these alarm companies way too expensive. This fits my budget and it more customizing.,4,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Fantastic cameras for the price, similar in picture quality to my nest cameras for a fraction of the price. Not quite as many features but still impressive array. Connectivity is on par and the app is easy to use. Cameras were easy to set up and love the magnetic option. I bought two so far. One sits on a book shelf and mounted the other on a wall in my daughters play room using command strips and the included metal mounting disc. One is used in my daughters room to supplement her baby monitor. The picture is so good we can see her breathing at night, something the baby monitor is not good enough for.  Would love to be able to just use this as a baby monitor however there is no option for always on audio in the background on my phone (something the baby monitor actually has as a feature so I know it’s possible). Or, if they made a companion viewing screen for these cameras that would stay on all night that would be great. Only con  is the design of the camera is not the prettiest nor is the quality of the housing materials. Definitely worth the cost.",4,1,2019-1-2,1,0,0
"I bought two of these, while one has no problem, the other started giving me difficulty connecting to the camera via the mobile app after one week of purchase (authentication keeps failing, restarting, resetting, reinstalling do not help). Since i bought them just before travel, I missed the opportunity to return as well. same products, same network, same app, one works fine, the other is useless. That says a lot about the quality of the product. Try another system, they may be a lot pricier, but then offer a lot more safety as well.",1,1,2019-9-13,1,1,0
"I use this camera as a spy cam for my 2 dogs.  I check on them multiple times per day to ensure they haven't sneaked out of the backyard.  I also used it while I was away and had people check on them.  For the price and what it does, it is definitely worth the value.  Would I use it as a security camera for my home?  Absolutely not, because the camera catches 12 secs of motion, which is usually my dogs approaching the door and not necessarily the person coming into the house.  I also noticed that after the initial 12 secs of motion, the camera doesn't send longer streams of video with the continuous recording, unless you go into the app and watch the video streaming live.  Sadly, I live in an area where I pay 0.20/GB of internet streaming so it could get expensive streaming 24/7.  Finally, the cam does record to the sd card that's house inside the camera but if someone were to take it, then the recording would be gone and all you would have would be the 12 secs of motion recording (that for me would likely just be my dogs approaching the door).  For all those reasons, this camera doesn't work well as a security system but it's an awesome pet spy cam!",5,1,2018-8-17,1,1,0
"Pretty easy to set up and once you set up the first any others couldn't be easier. Plug in push a button tap your app and scan the app with the camera then your done. Night vision is pretty good but could be a little better, day picture is not idea for enlarging, even when I know the person I can't always say I could identify them. There is about a 5 minute delay in receiving notifications, occassionally a little quicker but usually 5 or more. I do believe that my cell carrier is part of the delay (Verizon) I am using them outside with a mount I bought separately. So far very good. Range is good so far. I am going to try and mount them on my separate garage and then further on my barn, I'll try and repost on their distance ability.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"Amazing features, awkward interface.The Wyze camera can record to an SD card based on motion or sound events or continuously, it can manually record to your phone, and it can send 12 second video ""Push Notifications"" of events (with a 5 minute cool down period in between notices) via the web. It's often unclear which is which because of the poor interface in the phone app. And while it's great that there is no extra fee/subscription required, that also means you can't reliably use it as a security camera since the camera can be stolen with the SD card and there is no option to upload more than one 12 second HD clip every 5 minutes.",4,1,2019-4-14,1,0,0

"What an amazing camera for the price! I bought mine as part of a package deal. The camera was offered for just $5, so I thought, why not? At that time, I had never heard of Wyze, so I really wasn't expecting much. This little guy blew me away! It's small, sleek, easily adjustable, and the base is conveniently magnetic. I love the square modern look that it has, although it's small enough that many of my friends don't even notice it at first! I set mine up (using IFTTT) to record motion when I am away from the house. It's really just my pets that set it off, but of course, that's a good thing! The quality of the recording is great! It's very clear, even at night. I love that fact that I can easily check in with a live feed. The best part is that you don't pay a storage fee! Your recordings are saved to a cloud for 14 days for free! Your videos are downloaded when you watch them. I love the fact that you only pay for the camera and there are no hidden or extra fees. I am probably going to invest in the new 360° camera as well. I am really impressed with Wyze for making great cameras that are affordable!",5,1,2019-5-28,1,0,0

It would be nice if they fixed this as it is confusing and annoying until you understand what's going on, then it's just annoying.

"Be warned that you WILL NOT get the 1080p HD image quality that Wyze advertises.

Your baby will be blurry, license plates will be unreadable, faces usually unrecognizable, etc.You get what you pay for, and at the price point this is a competitive webcam. But for all the goodwill Wyze built up, it's seeming more and more like a bait and switch product to get you into their subpar subscription service.

Im sure some people are having a decent experience but not I. One thing of note for other people, we wanted to use this as a semi baby/child monitor and view the feed on a google home hub. This camera will only stay on the hub for 10 mins and then will go away. This was unfortunate and you cant find that out till you try.

"Update. Bought these 2 a couple of weeks ago and so far they are working great. Also bought the pan camera about a month ago. It is still working great. Just ordered 2 more of the pan. I use the non panning one as a child monitor. Works better than any expensive baby monitor I’ve ever seen. Resets itself if power or WiFi is interrupted.  I installed the micro SD cards too. Had a little difficulty formatting them but after first formatting them on laptop, then installing in camera, selecting format on app, they formatted and work great.Bought 2 of these.  Already have the WYZE pan camera. Set up was easy. CAMERA WOULD NOT RECOGINIZE the 64 GB card. Had to format it on LAPTOP FIRST. I used the quick format but camera would not recognize card. I then used  the slow default formatting option which took about 15-20 minutes. The camera then recognized it but storage space showed .05 GB. Selected format option on app. It formatted to 58GB.  Great picture. Without SD card it records 12 second motion events and sends you an alert. Click on alert and it takes you directly to viewing camera.  With SD card you can record motion events for 1 minute segments or continuous recording. I think it would be silly not to add a  SD card for $10.  After SD card fills it behind overwriting the oldest recordings.",5,1,2019-1-23,1,0,1

I am extremely impressed. It was a dream to setup and the scene event detection software - it detects people in the scene, is outstanding. The low price is incredible, and I even saw it in Lowe’s for $25. Presumably Wyze are banking on people buying their subscription detection service with its sophisticated image management and alarm features. But the camera has all the free features I needed.

I have tried many cameras and this one hands down is the best.  For anyone having complications setting up or not having it work properly, it's the user and not the device.

"My son recommended this to me, for safety reasons. I love how I can look in on my home, when I'm away. I can arm and disarm alerts from anywhere. I bought the whole setup, including door censers, motion censers, outlet plugs, and 2 stationary cameras. I did have to buy a longer cord for the panning camera, because I mounted it on the ceiling. The night vision works exceptionally well. I was surprised when I pulled up the cameras (on my phone) in the middle of the night, it was pitch black in the house, and I could see perfectly. The door censer mounted easily, and didn't have to be perfectly positioned, mine is off set by about 1/2 in. and still works great. The motion censer covers a much larger area than expected. When my furnace kicks on it moves my curtains slightly, and I get an alert on my phone. Just a heads up, when you have the motion detection on, it will follow you around the house, which is a little unsettling, but you can turn it off. I feel this was one of the best purchases I've ever made. Piece of mind is priceless, but I didn't have to break the bank to buy the whole set up.

"Having used these now for a year I would rate this as a toy. They need to advertise they only record an event ONCE every 5 mins even if you have a SD card (it does record 24 / 7 with the SD card). This essentially makes it useless as a security camera. Also, the recordings are very short. This is not a big deal as I have an SD card in each one, but they do not make it easy to jump to that location to see what happened after the motion event capture ended.

"(Rita's hubby) Well Made.  I bought one $25.99, I thought it would be 20, but whatever.  I plugged it in, scanned the QR code and once you have a solid blue light you're good.  Saying that doesn't mean I got everything working.  I did  the firmware upgrade a couple of times, you copy a ""demo.bin"" file to the SD card, hold the setup button and power on.  That's not too hard but it does help.  After that I had trouble with connecting and the picture wasn't good.  I thought the camera was bad.  I was using a USB extension cord (power), and after a day of trial and error, I put a little USB voltage tester on the line and I was getting only 3.84 volts.  No fault of the camera.  I had another, better cord with ""gold plated"" ends and voltage went up to 4.74, and works great, picture's great.  I have it on the front porch and it gets good shots of lightning storms.  Sensitivity is adjustable for sound and motion.  And Google  hub and the Android TV will stream it!  That's cool.  I like it.  I'd recommend it.  If you're  using a USB extension, use a good one.  If you have any distortion in the picture, or difficulty connecting, that's where I'd look.  Birdhouse was $10.",5,1,2019-6-18,1,0,1
"Picture is OK, not great.  Price is good.  The free video storage sounds nice, but there is an oversight.  12 second videos are recorded when there is motion detected then it stops recording and there is some time period after when it won't record (Not sure how long).  So if you have 2 events back to back it will only record the first.  Also, 12 seconds isn't very long so it cuts off in the middle of an event often.  If someone were to break in, the camera would start recording when it first detected motion.  It might take a burglar more than 12 seconds to break a window and climb through.  By the time they get in the camera would stop recording and you may not get a good look.  I wish there were some option to record longer videos to Wyze or specified location.  You can use an SD card, but if the camera is taken you lose the video.",3,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"Well, this is a well designed product, but unfortunately, a) it only lasts until it’s one year warranty anniversary, b) expect it to keep disconnecting from the internet, c) it wouldn’t continuously record video despite the fact that I put in a 32gb memory card, d) expect the customer service to brush you off when contact them for a legitimate tech issue, citing the reason that the warranty is over by a month! For a startup and crowd-funded venture that has high hopes for future improvement and market share, this kind of behavior and product quality is slippery slope. For a customer like me, it’s lost of some $$$, hours of time lost in communicating with with the company and even more time lost fixing the flawed product. Stay away and invest in something better unless you plan to be on the ladder fixing it every other week, like me!!",2,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
I was honestly surprised by the quality of this camera.Its small! Which I appreciate. The picture quality is great. It was easy to pair. It’s easy to access from my phone. I don’t use it all the time so I’m glad it’s not sending me constant notifications.,5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Our Wyze camera is unbelievable!  My ONLY complaint is that I had to get tech support to enable push notifications, but it was easily resolved.  The sound detection had to be turned off completely (we live on a busier road), and the sensitivity of the motion detection had to be moved to the lowest setting (the cats were setting it off 50 x a day).  I have yet to play with the ""rules"" function, but I think I'd like to be able to set it so it only sends us notifications during specified hours (I don't need to see it on my phone when someone gets up in the night to pee).  I couldn't be happier with the product - and it's honestly the best $30 we've ever spent.  I would recommend the Wyze camera to anyone in need of a watchful eye on an area of their home.  Note - indoor use only on our model.",5,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"My partner and I have purchased four of the Wyze Cams so far and couldn't be more pleased.  My Rating is based on Price to Value, for that I give 5 stars. They definitely do they job all in one tiny little box.  We have three of this model and one Wyze Cam Pan 1080p Pan/Tilt/Zoom Wi-Fi Indoor Smart Home Camera with Night Vision and 2-Way Audio. I would say the only downfall is the cord.  We have mounted one to the corner of the kitchen and it gets the whole area no problem.  It was harder finding the right spot to put a corded camera in our living room, as the ceilings are very high. If we were to mount this in the corner like we did in the kitchen the cord would be a big issue. Having that said, I absolutely love the fact that if I need any of our 4 kids all I have to do is open an app.  Even if you aren't looking for Security Cameras the ease of being able to get your kids attention without having to shout for them is worth the low cost!  It is like having a home intercom system.  As many parents do we have had issues with our teens going in our room. It caused a lot of unneeded frustration trying to get out of them who it was and why.  These cameras have saved us so much stress in that matter.  Although I know why, I was a teenager too, it's because we tell them not to! Now that they know we have cameras they don't even try it.  The camera detection alerts do only save the first 10 seconds after motion or sound is detected.  This could be an issue if for example you think you have an untrustworthy roommate.  Let's say you think they are stealing your food.  You would most likely be able to catch them in the fridge but if you are not watching the stream as they are in the kitchen you most likely won't see what they take.  I gave sound quality 4 stars as a few times I have turned on the camera's Live Feed and the sound has not been able to catch up in time.  However, once again, for the price the sound quality is great.  Overall, I have and will continue to recommend these cameras to anyone looking.  It's worth it guys and gals.",5,1,2019-2-26,1,0,1
"Until now, I have been using Nest cameras where I have electrical connection.  I use Arlo battery powered cameras where I don't have an easy connection.  The Wyze cameras are the best I've used.  The 1080P HD is excellent and the functionality is comparable to cameras like Nest that cost 6 times as much.  I have now replacde my 5 Nest cameras with Wyze (3 that are stationary and 2 that have power rotation and tilt).  Wyze also gives you free cloud storage and a 12 second motion capture.  Nest charges for any kind of cloud storage.  The other thing I found is that the response of motion detection is far better than any camera I have evaluated.I highly recommend this product and still can't believer the cost is so little.",5,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0
Not exactly sure if this detects any motion and starts recording as I haven’t seen any events recorded even though I’ve moved multiple times in the past week in front of the camera. It’s cheap quality and you can see that from the picture. Also it says it records only for 30 seconds and then has a 5 min wait before it can record second time. If you need continuous recording you have to pay extra and subscribe to their cloud service. I don’t see the point of that since I have ring which is far better in quality and detecting motion.,2,1,2020-1-2,1,1,0

"For 1. Let me start by saying, it's like it has a motorized swivel to be able to move the camera, but it doesn't move, it just sits still, you can zoom in, but can't move to see a blind spot, as far as privacy goes, I don't give a sh** if they spy on it or not, I stuck it in my storage building outside incase someone tries to break into it, so it will notify me and if I am home and night time, i'll just bury them in the building I guess, It has a great picture, also has sound, and can identify people I believe, has a few settings to adjust sensitivity, night vision is pretty good as well, I do not like the mount though, you can not securely mount it to where it won't either fall off, or just be picked up and taken, it should be able to be screwed to the actual platform it's located on, other than not being able to move around though, it seems like a great cam for the price.",3,1,2019-11-7,1,0,1
"For whatever reason after awhile mine just stops working requiring a reset (by power cycling) to get it fully functioning again. It will work okay for a day or two and eventually will stop sending motion detection notifications or I can't access the video stored on the unit, it shows the timeline as being empty when I access it, but when I reset it, it works again, but only for a few days.I guess you get what you pay for, it just isn't reliable enough to use a serious security solution.",2,1,2018-2-12,1,3,0
"The camera and app work great under certain circumstances. Works fine with phone accessing data or on my home wifi network. The app is limited in that it cannot be used at all on a PC. Seems like with a little R&D on the app that shouldn't be a problem but apparently is not a priority for this company. The app would not work on the network where I work. I can log in fine but the video feed apparently doesn't follow the same stream as logging into the app. At the same time it works fine with my phone accessing data, but I don't have unlimited data and it would have been nice to access my cameras through my work wifi or through my pc. Really disappointed in the functionality of the app.",2,1,2018-8-10,1,3,0
"From delivery to viewing 2 cameras, 10 minutes (2G network only). I am using them on my work network and I am blown away with how much better the image is than the mounted camera on the side of the building.  One camera is facing a road with light to moderate traffic and the other is overlooking the production floor with 3 active lines and other activity around the edges. I do have both set to SD as trying the HD appeared to have transfer issues (to be fair I am at the far reaches of the wireless signal with the first camera). I don’t need HD, so I will leave things as they are and I plan to purchase several more of these cameras.I can even share the cameras with other Wyze App users, which makes it rather fun. These have microphones and speakers and some even have CO and smoke detectors…crazy for $20-$30.",4,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"The hardware seems great, but unfortunately the app that accompanies the Wyze camera, or the interface between  camera and app works inconsistently. User interface on the app is very similar to Yi home app, however sometimes with much more lagging, and failures to load recorded videoa. Some features work but other critical functionality works only sometimes, e.g., video often does not load or play ""view playback"" mode, and frequently fails to allow user to access recordings via a mobile device on a 4LTE (mobile data/multiple phones tried) network. These issues are reported by other users on the Wyze forums, yet have not been fixed--hopeful that they will be corrected soon.  Although the Arlo Q hardware is much more expensive, it works almost flawlessly with my devices and similarly doesn't require a subscription for remote storage of alert videos.",3,1,2018-11-29,1,2,0
I wanted a security camera to watch my place when I’m not at home and can see what is going on. I did not want to pay the price and was looking around and see this one. The picture is clear and so are the videos that I have taken. The only down fall is I have this set on person notice and it picks up every movement from the animals moving to the wind blowing the trees. So I hope they can get the person movement to just record a person and not everything else. Up date don't waste your mony you get want you pay for. The last week I have trouble connecting to my camera though my cell phone It keeps telling me to connect to a different mobile device. Then at one point I had to remove the app from my phone and reinstalled it. Then I also find out if you want to record you have to keep the app open to do that. So back to finding another camera. I dropped the rating to 2 stars. I have to keep removing the app from my phone and reinstall it. Really a disappointment,2,1,2019-8-7,1,0,1
"As you see in the pictures i posted the Nest cam has a larger viewing angle and perhaps a little better picture quality.. but that cost me $200.  So is the Nest a better camera? Yea.. is it 10x better ($20 vs $200)? Absolutely not.So I am extremely pleased with the Wyze 2.0 cam but I can't believe them when they say 1080p. In the picture posted below I am about 15 feet away but you can't make out my face that clearly. A cellphone camera has no problem taking a clear photo at this distance so I'm not sure why these home security cameras have such a difficult time taking the same quality photo. Even my Nest cam at $200, which also claims to be 1080 has a difficult time taking a clear photo of faces and definitely no chance of picking up numbers on a license plate.",4,1,2019-10-13,1,0,1
"Cameras are very cool and worked great for one week. Suddenly it stopped detecting people coming to my door. I called Wyze and was told they no longer have a contract with a third party to detect people. I asked when they might fix this. I was told they don't know. If you need a camera that picks up every single car 75 feet away, but not a porch pirate two feet from the camera, this is the right camera for you. That's 50 bucks down the drain for me.",1,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0

Audio is not that great, but still can hear enough to know what's being said. The picture quality is pretty good during the day, except if you zoom too much, then it gets 90's TV series pixelated type result.Overall, for a primary security cam, I would say a 4* does it justice.

However the stream only works maybe 10% of the time, the rest of the time I get a black screen. When it does work, the video is lagged about 20 seconds.

"Upon initial setup of this item, despite following the instructions to the letter, this product did not function whatsoever.  I  confirmed my WiFi is 2.4GHz, disabled Google VPN, reset the app, rebooted my phone multiple times, power cycled the camera as the app suggested. Despite this, nothing worked, and I had to manually flash the new firmware from a MicroSD card and power cycle it several more times before it actually began working as intended. That's not hard for me, but I couldn't expect to give this to a parent, grandparent, or anyone else tech-illiterate who just wants to watch their house or their dog or something.Now that it's working, I can say that I am quite satisfied with the product - the picture quality is good and it has plenty of options to customize the recording. Notably absent, however, is the ability to record more than 12 seconds to the cloud.  It generates a 12-second ""alert video"" that gets stored in the cloud, but if you want to scrub back, even just along the times when motion was detected, you need a microSD card - you can stream this through the cloud, of course, but wouldn't do you any good if an intruder were to destroy your camera and the SD card, or if the intruder removed their a mask after 12 seconds.  So people with legitimate security concerns may wish to look elsewhere.  Even the Presence app, which has been around for years and years as a way to use your old phones as cameras, will record up to 5 minutes every time it detects motion and provides ample cloud storage for this.",2,1,2019-1-27,1,0,0

It is rare that something this inexpensive is also literally the best wifi camera I have come across. We use this as a baby monitor. Other brands either have a huge amount of lag between the camera and your device or have apps that will bomb overnight. I am an IT director so I feel I have a great home home network and internet service so it is my opinion that any fault lies with the device and its software. This camera has almost no lag and the app has bombed once in the last 3 months. I know it sounds to good to be true if you have been rolling through countless cameras as we did but it really is an amazing value. Heck I even paid $175 for an Alro baby monitor 6 months back and the app couldn't stay up on any of my devices for more than 3 hours without bombing.,5,1,2019-9-24,1,0,0
"Excellent product.  Since I can not force my phone to use 2.4-GHz, do the following:  if you have a WiFi mesh, easiest is to unplug your satellites and install this camera when you sit far from your router.  (I recommend you install a free WiFi monitor app ... find a location where your phone will downshift from 5-GHz to 2.4-GHz.)  Installation is then easy (note: some users don't realize:  you point the Wyze camera at your phone when the 2-D barcode appears, you don't use the phone to scan the 2-D code that is on the camera).  Also: it is safest to install this on your ""guest"" wifi option and not your primary wifi location.  This will help prevent access to your home's wifi if there is a data breach.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0

My last complaint is that theres a 5min cool down between event recording, so say if someone is going through your stuff, you get a 12 sec recording, at which point you probably have to switch to a live stream, and manually record at that point, which seems kinda counter productive..

The little camera is easy to mount and set up with the Wyze app.  The app is very easy to use and to add additional cameras so that you can control and monitor all of them from one program.  I have to say I also love the two way audio feature and automatic night vision.  It was easy to set up multiple cameras to watch different areas of my house and to have one to monitor our sleeping baby!  You can adjust the sensitivity settings so that small movements or sounds don't disturb you, or turn them up so that any movement will trigger the app to warn you of activity.

I purchased an SD card so it is recording 24x7. It will only use bandwidth to send small 14sec clips to the cloud and when you connect to the camera to watch anything else, recorded or live.

Usually after about 10 minutes of using the app to restart the camera, turn it on/off, close the app, disconnect/reconnect from wifi, change various settings, etc., I can get it to show the live camera feed, but not always.

You buy these cameras once and you're good to go but it would be a good idea to buy MicroSD cards for each one (those are cheap anyway).Also, they do not require a central hub as they connect to your existing WIFI. The reason why this is good is because many people nowadays have mesh WIFI setups (such as Eero and Orbi) to help with range.  Competitors use a proprietary hub device that their cameras connect to.

"I bought two Wyze V2 and on Pan. As an owner of Arlo Pro and Arlo Pro 2 I highly recommend this product. The main difference from other similar cameras is ability to record 24/7 to internal MicroSD card, it the same as NVR feature. Which meant that you may not only get 12 seconds from cloud, but see whole activities as well. For that unbeatable price this product kill other competitors. I spent 700 dollars for Arlo and may say that all buyers love Wyze. All owners asking Wyze for more products such as outdoor camera and doorbell.Unfortunately Wyze sent a letter to all clients that Xnor.Ai will stop human detection in mid January. This is real downside for surveillance product in term of reliability of false alarms. Hope that Wyze will be able to run that feature by themselves.",5,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
"I bought this camera to keep track of my two little dogs while I am at work.  It has not met expectations.  The camera does not consistently notify me of movement - something that is pretty critical and why I bought it.  It was always sending me notifications of flies, especially at night, but not lately (winter).  Despite this apparent sensitivity, I often find a mess in the camera view, but no record of the dog who left it there.  Ironically, it is great at notifying me that I am cleaning up the mess!  It is more consistent in letting me know a lamp or light has gone on.  I had low expectations when purchased because of the price, but it has not even met my low expectations.",1,1,2019-1-24,1,2,0
"You may not have noticed that very few brick and mortar stores that sell electronics sell these cameras. These cameras are the best security cameras I have come across.

"I've had the camera up and running for a year now and I loved it, it was perfect. I went ahead and updated the camera as instructed by the wyze app last month. Then it started to malfunction, where as it was working perfectly before the update. It clicks loudly constantly and only stays online for 20 seconds at a time. I then have to restart it, and it again only stays online for 20 seconds. It's very frustrating. My advice-  if you get it up and running adequately, never ever update it. Just don't. Now I'm off to buy a different camera because this is just not worth my time anymore.",1,1,2020-1-15,1,1,0
"This can exceeded my expectations. It has features I didn’t even consider. It also synced very easily with my WiFi and the phone app. It works in every way promised. The sound, color picture, and night vision are impressive for this low price. It even lets u zoom in in images. I don’t have an SD card but the app still saves both, videos, sound, and pictures.This cam is a solid 5! The only things I would prefer is a rotation feature and I wish it came in black. I used a sharpie and colored in the front so it would be less noticeable. Btw, the base is magnetic. Since I live in an apt, I have it on top of the fridge facing tree living space and front windows. I was surprised to see that it would not move or fall down because if the magnetic feature. Love this cam!",5,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0

The second generation cameras (including the pan cam) are useful only as a live camera. If you put an SD card in it to record video it will need to be restarted almost daily to find the card again.  Every time I need to view my recorded video in the past couple of months there was no video available and I have to restart the camera so it starts recording again. Not very useful as a security camera!  Hard to believe a $20 camera that's not even worth $20!  Will be replacing my Wyze cams with another brand and throwing these in the trash.,1,1,2020-4-22,1,1,0
"I have owned the cam for 2 months now and it is a nice little cam. Well-built for its price, clear video, good set of features and at the same time inexpensive.I also own several Nest cameras and while they work great their motion notifications takes considerably longer (~10s). What is lacking in this cam is the choice to store video on the cloud so if an intruder took the SD card you are pretty much out of luck. It stores 12s of video on the cloud whenever it detects motion, but it may or may capture the moment you need. It doesn’t recognize my SD card, by the way, but I haven’t tried a different one to say it is defective.",2,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0
"Very good product, amazing picture quality, nice night vision, motion, noise and smoke detector for an amazing price.  But as far as Works with Alexa...  Their Alexa Skill sucks!  It's basically useless.  You cannot trigger routines from the camera's detecting motion, noise or whatever.  And you cannot program the camera to do anything, in case a routine is triggered by another device or event.  In my first review, I said that this is basically a stand-alone device which works only with its own Mobile App, NOT with Alexa.  For this latest update:  Had to uninstall/reinstall their app on my phone.  The app lost connection with the existing camera.  I cannot delete it from the app to reinstall the camera.  It's stuck there, doing nothing.  Returned to Amazon.  Bottom line is:  Excellent hardware but horrible software and bad customer experience",1,1,2019-6-12,1,0,0

This will also make a great baby shower gift to use as a baby monitor.Overall very pleased for what I payed and what I have received. They could definitely be charging more than what I paid for it.",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"I purchased this camera to upgrade from my old one with only 360/720p.  The picture quality is good and the zoom is excellent.  However, it didn't pick up motion well that I didn't get alert most of the time even though I and my daog were walking around in the room.  I addition, the software couldn't tell when is motion detected from the playback timeline so that I can't really review if someone is in my house!

Tried a Wyze Cam Pan but it kept losing network connection where the Wyze Cam did not so I only use the Wyze Cam camera's outdoors now.Motion detection still needs refinement as bugs, blowing things, snow will trigger the motion detection. There are feature enhancement requests to only detect motion longer than x seconds that will help sometime in the future. People tracking works fine, avoiding updating firmware (that drops people detection) until Wyze comes out with a replacement solution.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"In short, for the price, it’s a very nice camera. Simple to set up, very good picture quality, and a nice iOS app to go along with the unit. However, it does need a little polish in the following areas. First off, the motion detector, even set to the lowest sensitivity, is triggered too often. A slight breeze on a branch in a capture area will trigger the notification. Next, the time lapse download is triggering an error out of the blue. Short of resetting the device, I haven’t figured out how to get it working again. Also, I haven’t found a way to lengthen the alert recording past 12 seconds. It would be nice if it was possible, and if so, it was made easy to do. Overall however, in some ways, I prefer this over my Arlo for places that aren’t too far from a power outlet. I would recommend this device for indoor usage where power is available.",4,1,2018-1-11,1,2,0
"I saw this cam and noticed that it was by a young ""interrupter"" company so, I thought I'd give them a shot. That was about a year ago. Since then they started ""person detection"" which needed a lot of AI learning because it missed me passing right in front of it so often. Then they would constantly send updates that made me fear it would just make it worse (because often it did). Then they got hacked where, as I recall, a bunch of our info was compromised. They only notified us after the news broke out. Called their customer service and it was incredibly difficult to get to them. After some updates they had to send me replacements because the originals no longer worked. Now I have 4 to replace 2 and, until most recent update, only one worked properly (I had given up on the other). Customer service has had me go reverting updates before because the more recent ones wouldn't work. Now I don't even get a response anymore. At this point the detection is more annoying than functional. The cams have become little more than recording devices. Not the security cams I wanted. This is where I make good on my promise to Wyze and leave a review.Spend a bit extra on something that gives you what you need.🤷‍♂️",1,1,2020-5-21,1,1,0

Picture is great, the audio is excellent, for its size, it has a lot to offer. Has the 14  day free storage which is cool. The down side is its only 12 seconds and there is a delay of 5 minutes in between a certain amount of motion detections. As of the time of this writing, they released a firmware update which removes this delay and adds complete motion(for a price). Its like 1.50 per camera. Their always improving. Their video steaming is was faster than that ""other"" door bell camera service. So far i love it. Bought 4 more and some bulbs in testing out.",5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0

With the included magnetic mount system we were able to capture an entire room with one camera mounted in a corner.The picture is great. The motion tracking is something I haven't experienced before but was really cool to see in action. The app itself is also very easy to use, easy to manage multiple cameras.

"I think this camera is great for the price. However, there were quite a few occasions when I received a delivery or steped out my front door and it did not notify me. I am assuming it monitored and notified me of different movement and my delivery was too close to the 12 seconds (the length of the frame, however you can use playback from the frame) so it did not notify me. Therefore if I wanted to find out the delivery time I would have to sit and review all the recording for that day which is way too time consuming.

"This camera is a great price with very good features. It interfaces with Alexa Show easily. It has all the great features like motion detection, sound detection and person detection. You can send alerts to your phone and you can capture video. But, the data all goes through China and they could turn it off if they get upset with the US (Trump) and make them useless. If it wasn’t for that, I would buy more. So, I have other independent camera to augment these. I will wait to see what happens. But, just like Taiwan, they could behave for years and then take action. I may be over thinking this issue but....Other fixable issues I have are: 1. The cords are too short most of the time, 2.the captured event video is too short most of the time for when motion is detected 3. No mention of the daisy chain capability or how to use it 4.

My camera was only able to work for about 10 months and it bricked itself after a failed firmware update. I contacted the customer service and they confirmed that my camera was defective and would be providing a replacement; however, that's where things started getting tricky here... After the chat, they only sent you the transcript w/ a support ticket number and then NOTHING was going to happen afterwards. No follow up email, no replacement order being created, nothing... And when you contacted them again, they always said they were unable to locate my replacement order even though I provided them the ticket number every time. Then they basically kicked you back and forth between different reps that ever assisted you w/ this issue and nothing was done about your replacement order as if the order was never created and they just wanted to make you give up on getting your replacement, so THE WARRANTY IS BASICALLY A JOKE. I understand it's always risky to buy cheap Chinese electronics b/c the quality of their product or service is never comparable to leading brands, but didn't realized Wyze is no exception either despite its high popularity.",1,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0

The app is pretty easy to use, but doesn't come with any instructions so you just need to play around with it to figure everything out.I previously gave 4 stars because I was having connection issues but it had to do with the type of router I have (Asus), I had to go in and change a setting on the router and haven't had any issues since. So if you have an Asus router you need to go in and disable ""airtime fairness"". There's more info and a guide on how to do this in the Wyze community forums.",5,1,2019-4-5,1,0,0
"The price is what was really appealing and what made me choose this camera. I set it up outside to watch my chickens. It's not a great camera at anything, the video quality is quite bad, I would compare to a really low-end dash cam, it does produce visible video at night, but maybe up to 10-15 feet. The motion mostly catches insects flying around it at night. The app is sometimes glitchy. But after all the negatives though I would still choose this camera as it does work and it's fun to get alerts and occasionally see some possum or deer walking outside and there doesn't seem to be any better alternative, as I got worse results from those wild game cameras that you hang on trees which cost x15-30 more.",4,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0

"I am thrilled with this tiny little camera! At a wopping 2”x2”, this cube provides exactly the affordable, low-complexity, user friendly solution to home security we were looking for. I ordered one Wyze camera along with a black outdoor housing case and 25ft extension cord for our front entry to just try it out; after all, no tears or hard feelings on an investment less than $30 bucks all together— I just got it set up and went ahead and ordered three more for the rest of our home exterior. No monthly subscription needed, the app is easy and helpful. Perfect for our simple needs in remote home monitoring!",5,1,2019-2-24,1,1,0
I am very impressed with this Wi-Fi cam and surprised at the features it offers for less than $30.The design is simple and effective. It’s well balanced and has a small foot print.,5,1,2018-12-18,1,0,0
"Always remember, you get what you pay for. This may be the biggest waste of money of anything I've ever purchased on Amazon. I'm A+ Certified computer tech, CompTia Network + certified, MCP and MCSA Microsoft certified and this thing is a complete joke. First of all, if you don't have a router capable of the older 2.4 network, you are wasting your time and money. If you run an open wifi in your house, you are wasting your time and money with this product. This item was recommended to me by a friend, and if they won't buy it from me at half price, then they are no longer my friend, that's how bad this POS is. TRUST ME...SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT OR ANY OF THE WYZE PRODUCTS. You know those products that you read the ads and the setup seem so simple it's too good to be true. Then you buy that product and realize you were right and then you spend 10 hours on the phone with support and can never get it to work simply because they didn't tell the ""whole story""? Well this is that product. Don't believe the ""company supported"" YouTube videos either. STAY AWAY FROM THIS  PRODUCT, unless you can write your own router code.",1,1,2019-7-20,1,1,0
"It doesnt display temp or anything extra in regards to a baby monitor but for what we deem necessary it works great. I've programmed it to record and it records in those parameters. It has surpassed my expectations. The only thing i wish that could be improved is the sound quality of the speaker when using this as a 2 way comm link. Otherwise, great product, you will not be unhappy with this purchase.",5,1,2019-4-6,1,2,0
"I rarely provide a review this low, but I received the camera without any instructions in any form. For a product such as this, some form of instructions are essential. Since I have no means by which to determine if it is functional or not, I will likely return it.Edit:",3,1,2018-12-11,1,0,0
"These cameras are great.  I mostly put them in enclosures and mount them outdoors in various places such as showing my driveway, front door, etc.  When I first installed them I noticed that they connected strongly with my wifi network.  The picture quality is good.  These store 12 second clips when they detect motion or sound to the sensitivity that you select.  The feature I'm seeing today that I didn't see previously is that now the Alexa integration is fixed.  Wow, I just say ""Alexa, show the driveway cam."" And there it is on my 70"" tv hooked up to my Fire TV UHD.  Configuration was easy.  Now I can easily see a section of my outdoors that was previously blind for me.  I used the camera speaker and mic through the app once when I had someone at the door but couldn't get to the door.  It has a delay but worked very well.  Definately very happy with this purchase.",5,1,2019-3-8,1,0,0

"Purchased 2 of these for my home so i could keep on things while at work with all the issues with porch pirates & what not. I'm pleasantly suprised with how nice a picture these produce. Set up was extremely easy with the app and connecting to my wifi. I purchased a 32 gig sd card to go into the camera as well so i don't have to connect them to the wifi if i don't want, only downfall to not connecting them to your wifi is they won't live stream without it. They have the option for motion and sound detection as well as getting notifications sent to your phone. I've set mine for motion detection and when triggered they record 12 seconds, starting 2 seconds before it was tripped. All in all they very nice especially at this price and I've had zero issues out of them after about 2 weeks of use so far. If your debating on these just go ahead and order em, you won't be disappointed. They also offer weather proof cases for them if you wanna locate them outdoors as well as offer a wide lens kit.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"This is a great little camera for the price.  While having to plug it in does limit its location, on the flip side you aren't constantly recharging batteries.  Unfortunate that the camera only comes in white - I will possibly be wrapping mine in electrical tape to darken it up a bit - all of my electronics are black and having this on the shelf with them just looks odd.The app is super easy to use and the syncing the app and camera is a breeze.  The app does have a ""schedule"" that you can set (record at certain times), but I prefer to employ geofencing via IFTTT.  It did un-sync my camera once so far, but still not a bad set-up.",4,1,2019-5-7,1,0,0
"Easy to set up. Great picture, clear good quality. Real time viewing or play back. Not waterproof I have one on A table in my kitchen.  That works perfectly. I have bought A Lot of Expensive Cams over the Years and my WYZE Cam is by far the best. Works great on my old cell phone. I can view anywhere in the world. if movement like my Cat, Dog or a person it instantly sends a 12 sec. video clip to my phone, tablet & computer anything that you installed the App on gets the clip. You can set the Zone & sensitivity that something has to pass thru So you can Eliminate picking up Dog & cat And a person would have to crawl to keep from detection and sending a event clip to you phone. You can also set the cam to target movement. The cam will hold hours of video on disk and if someone is able to power off the cam you have backup video on your phone. it is perfect for Baby or pet monitoring.

"The best thing about these cams is they're cheap and fairly portable. The bad thing is, they primarily only support their cloud based recording service and their images eventually get red/pint tints on bright areas, regardless of where they're placed (in direct sunlight or out).If I were doing this all over again, I'd rather spend a bit more on my 7 cam setup and get something locally stored. That said, it'd probably cost a lot more to do so.",3,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
"I've used Cloud Baby Monitor app and Cocoon baby monitor so that's what I'm comparing to. The Wyze Cam is almost the best value for a video/smart phone baby monitor, except they haven't added the ability to monitor the audio in the background on your phone. As soon as you switch apps or close your phone you can no longer listen to the audio feed. If they add this feature I'm sure their sales will go through the roof. I know I will recommend it. If you want this feature please find ""Background Audio"" on the Wyze Cam community page and up vote it.One other quibble. It detects when my smoke/CO detector goes off, but there's no way to get push notifications for the alarm and not for motion and sound events unless I turn off motion and sound event recording. In other words, there's no way to have motion and sound events recorded but only get push notifications for the Smoke/CO detector.",3,1,2019-3-29,1,0,0
"This little wi-fi motion detection video camera works very well. Connecting it to my network was very easy. It seems to connect with my phone much faster than my Arlo system does. The newest software update allows you to set it to detect motion from people, so you don't have to deal with those alerts every time a cat or squirrel runs by your window.The price fro this type of technology is amazing, and it offers free cloud storage for several days. You can also add a microSD card and have it continually record on a loop.",5,1,2019-7-11,1,1,0
"The picture quality is pretty good for what I expected with the price. Connection doesn't take too long when it wants to work, there's been several time where it just wouldn't connect and kept freezing. Being able to watch the camera on two phones at once is great though.I wouldn't at all consider this to be a security camera, pretty sure the agreement also states it's not intended for emergency or high security uses.",3,1,2019-8-6,1,1,0
This thing has so much more potential than they let it have. What I REALLY needed was something that would work with my other cameras and MOST importantly connect with my Blue Iris software. THIS....does not do that.If you remove my specific need for it to connect to blue iris.....it works rather wonderfully. The picture is amazing for the price....night vision is amazing. IT DETECTS PEOPLE!!! I that was a spiffy feature. It has magnets to help it to attach to surfaces - very handy. The phone app was not very difficult to use and works very well I think.,4,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"I tried several different memory cards including an ""official"" Wyze brand card bought directly from Wyze. None worked in the camera but all worked in other devices including another Wyze cam that I bought directly from Wyze. Returned to Amazon. Replacement cam from Amazon has same issue. Just tried to return replacement cam to Amazon, this time for a refund, but Amazon website says I'll get $0.00 credit. I'll try a return instead. This will be my third camera from Amazon. I regret buying from Amazon at this point.",1,1,2019-7-28,1,1,0
I’m so disappointed with these cameras. Bought three. Went to great lengths to wire them up etc. They are so slow that any intruder would be in the house by the time they  alerted!I’ve adjusted the sensitivity. Set them to alert to a “person”. They just don’t work well. I can walk in front of one and it alerts my phone 30 seconds or so later.,2,1,2019-10-11,1,0,1
I purchased a few of these to use with Blue Iris; I flashed the firmware that allows me to use RTSP and then blocked all WAN traffic to the device on my network because all it needs to do is talk to the BlueIris server on my LAN. Lo' and behold this device will NOT stay connected to my BlueIris server unless it has WAN access. I did not dig in any more than that but it does not instill privacy confidence. Even with WAN access available and a brand new Ubiquiti NanoHD AP I still have to restart these Cameras 2-3 times a week because they lose connection to BlueIris. They're fine if you are just going to use the Wyze app to view them but anything much more than that is almost a non-starter.,2,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"I purchase my first Wyze camera about a year ago, and loved it so much I ordered a second.  They were a little noisy when it was quiet in the room as you could here it turning to follow you around.  They didn't bother me but everyone else could hear them and mentioned it.  I recently needed another camera but I noticed that Wyze now offers a smaller unit.  This camera seems to be stationary but still covers the entire room, so it's actually nicer.  This new one has a magnetic plate on the bottom so it will stick to anything metal which makes it more versatile. You can adjust it manually up or down as needed with the new ""arm"".  It also comes with a ""peel & stick"" metal plate so you can mount it easily, and remove it from the plate easily.  As you can see, the new one is about half the size of the older one.  They're a great value for the money (@ $30) and affordable too.  Once the app is downloaded to your smartphone, set up takes about 60 seconds.  Both cameras work great and I'll definitely be purchasing more of these as needed.  The picture and quality are the same as the larger size.",5,1,2019-8-19,1,0,1
"Only had this for about five days but it's also only worked about five hours total in that time. It is constantly disconnected, it won't recognize the Wyze brand SD card I installed per instructions about 98% of the time, and the ""power cycles"" don't work on the few times it has even let me do them. When it does work, it is cool. It just never works. At least it was only a waste of 25 bucks, and 13 for the card, and my time constantly trying to get it to work. I guess I can just hope the appearance of a security camera will help deter people from doing anything. Sigh...",2,1,2019-3-30,1,1,0
"Let me start of by saying this is our 1st camera for inside the home, so I have nothing to compare it to.That being said we love it!! 1 tip I have is buy the micro SD card at the same time. Without the card when the camera sense’s motion it records for 12 or 14 seconds. I can’t remember the exact amount of time. I recently had people come to clean our air ducts and I was able to communicate with them via the camera in real time! They were shocked when they heard me say ‘hi guys the dog is friendly’. I was able to have a real time conversation while I was parked at a rest stop in my truck. The camera paid for itself right then. I’m ordering a few more. It’s SUPER easy to set up  and works right away. You can have the App I staled on multiple devices with multiple people in your home. Anyway we love it and the price is AWESOME! Keep it up Wyze!",5,1,2019-7-21,1,1,0
"I’m giving this review two stars. That has nothing to do with the actual camera. The clarity on the camera is fantastic, the set up was simple and the camera works great. The reason for the two stars is the push notifications on iOS do not work. They worked one time, and have not worked since. I have done everything from unplugging and plugging the camera back in to uninstalling and reinstalling the app as well as re-starting my iPhone, but it still does not work.  If they fix this bug, this camera is five stars all the way!",2,1,2018-2-18,1,5,0

"Unbeatable for the price! Good picture quality, pretty easy set. It took a few attempts, but nothing major. Love the free 14 day rolling cloud storage. The notifications work excellent. The only thing I’m trying to figure out is that the initial video is only 30 seconds and many times I would like more. I’ve  bought a Micro SD card to try to lengthen the video time, but to no avail yet. Also, I bought the mounting case and it too was excellent. The webcam is wireless, but needs an electrical out to operate. Their new outdoor webcam that’s just coming out will be battery powered. Thus, it will be completely wireless. I’ve preordered one and will review it once I’ve tried it out.",5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0

I love it that i can view my camera via the app on my phone.  I like the sensors. They tell me when someone opens the back door.  My favorite is the Light Bulbs.  I have two in the house and one at the back door.  I can turned on and off them i get home via my back yard. I love that i can turn on my lights when i come down or turn them off when i head up.  The other day my nephew forgot to turn off the light and I was able via my room turn it off.  So far it has been a great item(s) to get.

"Re-Badged Chinese police state gear if you want to go that route. It kinda works...but very few SD cards will work in it--I can only imagine how many SD cards have been purchased by unsuspecting WYZE buyers only to see them not recognized by the camera. China has a vast police state central command/control facial recognition network to control all gazillion of its citizens and punish offenders. That means if you say the premier is not doing a good job or march in a protest--bingo--cops visit you or worse. Just as an example, no Chinese citizen would ever be allowed access to read this review!Well I'll be danged if WYZE didn't just announce a new facial recognition feature for your WYZE camera!  I wonder where they got that technology?",2,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0
I've been watching this camera for months wondering if I should get one. I would read all the recent reviews and then decide to wait longer. (We don't need it yet as it's going to go in our baby's room). I've had bad experiences with ip cameras in the past with them having glitches and having to mess with port forwarding and then randomly switching up addresses and being unaccessible. This camera is totally different! Smaller and super easy to set up!!!! I thought I'd have to be on my wifi in order to see the feed but I can view it anywhere! I was able to peek in on my daughters when they were being babysat while out on a date with my husband. You can't beat this price!,5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
These cameras are an awesome purchase especially at the current price. I have been researching and reading up on putting together the most practical home security system without the monthly monitoring fees. I read a lot of the reviews here noting some of the reviewers problems and the positives way out do any of the negatives. Now that I purchased my first camera and see how both it and the software perform I'll be buying more. As I dig into this company you can tell that they are both good at what they do and feel confident that they will continue to offer additional software updates along with other products that will mesh well this camera. I look forward to these upcoming products as I pursue the best home monitoring system without the monthly fees.,5,1,2019-9-19,1,0,0
"I bought this camera to replace one I had purchased from a local store (never worked well, app would rarely connect).I am so pleased with this small camera. I have always been able to connect to the app when away from home to look in on things. It does record when activated by movement or sounds. It will send you a notification on your phone thru the app. You can go into the settings on your app and set up the sensitivity, turn the camera on or off from home, there is a lot you can do from the app. You can also use a SD card though I have not done that.I will purchase another one in the near future. You just can't go wrong for the price. It was pretty easy to set up as well comes with instructions. This is a very affordable security tool. Gives you a little more peace of mind and one more thing, it is free to access, there was no request for me to have to put in a credit or debit card, you just use it.",5,1,2018-12-31,1,0,0
I couldn't believe how inexpensive this was.  It has a pretty easy setup (there were some issues with account creation but I got through them without contacting support) and it works on my phone and my wife's phone.  A web app would be nice but I don't miss not having one.  I especially love that it's adjustable - I can point it where I need to see.  My last camera was more than twice the price and didn't do that.  I like these guys!,5,1,2020-9-2,1,1,0
"I like the camera itself. The video quality is great and the motion detection is helpful. My only concern is the recent data breech. Other online review mentioned laxity in their terms of service. I usually brush that stuff off because these days we live in a tech driven world where close to none of our personal data is truly private. But the breech was caused by an internal error, according to the email I received from Wyze. I still use the camera, but and starting to reconsider now having privacy concerns. Whose to say that video footage isn’t next?",3,1,2020-1-2,1,1,0
"This camera works great. The motion capture, the two-way audio, the alerts, the ease of use of the app, all of that works great. But after 2 months the audio stopped working. When we use it we hear nothing but light static. If there's an especially loud noise there'll be a crackle. It's like the microphone went bad. We've tried all the trouble shooting on the website and my husband reached out to customer service and followed their instructions and we've done all the firmware updates and still nothing. We'd like to get a couple more cameras but we've been debating whether or not to get another Wyze. But at least the video works great on our current one so we'll keep using that one for now.

"I have 2 of this camera at home and recently bought another one for my friend's garage (someone stole his stuff from his garage recently). Overall, I think it's a cheap and good product. It's not great, but it's also only $25 or so. The picture quality could be better. I like the push notification, detection area specification, etc. They recently made a person detection a subscription service, which sucks since it used to be included as a base feature. But, many competitors out there requires subscriptions for more features, so I think Wyze is better that way in that they don't try too hard to milk customers, which shows that they care about us. I like that.",4,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0

"First, let me say that I use this camera inside my kitchen window to film the area in front of my garage door.  That is why night vision only got three stars.  Other than that, it is a super little camera, and I intend to order more for keeping an eye on my cats.  I currently have two other cameras which cost more and don't work as well.  I have not put a card in this one yet, because I haven't needed to.  I don't have to pay for cloud storage ( the Forscam requires this) and it was easy to figure out (the Wansview was not.

"A robin built her nest on top of the garage door opener this summer.  We wanted to see the process of her nesting, feeding the babies, etc. without disturbing them.  I couldn't be happier with this camera!  It was easy to download the app and connect our phones to the camera (you can download the app to more than one phone so that more than one person can see the images).  I did not purchase an sd card but I could take pictures and record video from the app and they were all stored on the phone. I was more than pleased with the image and video quality.  You do need a power source close by to plug the camera in if you want it to run continuously.  The base of the camera has a magnet and we were fortunate to be able to attach directly to a metal beam.  Watching the nesting, feeding, and fledging of these birds was the highlight of the summer.One of the pictures I uploaded was taken when the baby robins were 4 days old.  The green square you see is the camera's motion detection system.  The other photo is when they were 11 days old and you can clearly see the speckled feathers on the front of the baby bird.

It also has nearly full-360 viewing capabilities where you can swivel the lens toward any angle. The picture is great in daylight or dark & quite crisp.

After spending many tries to connect this to our wifi after mANY MANY failures it streams video quality that you cannot make out who is that person let alone anything else. Nightmode works better than daytime .. have no clue why but it was an overall a terrible experience. For this price I can see someone saying its a good deal but when I cannot see anything or make out anyone i know from the video its not going to make me keep it even if it was free!

The power cord is actually quite long, which was an unexpected plus. It is magnetic and comes with a mount that sticks on the wall and the camera sticks to the metal mount. Or you can just sit it on a flat surface. I can pull it up on my phone via the app, or I can view it on my Echo Show. The main thing I would change would be for Wyze to make a  battery-powered version of this camera.  I don't think you will be disappointed.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,1,0

The WYZE app has pretty good reviews, and I've had zero problems with it.Update: WYZE does not have a Windows client, but I really wanted to be able to stream the video on my computer.  WYZE does offer a firmware version with RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol), which can be streamed by many clients such as VLC.  Hopefully WYZE will mainline this patch.

There is no browser interface. You can only access the video on your phone. I'm sorry, I don't care how good the camera is, This is a tremendous oversight. They should have never released a camera without a web interface. That should've been priority. The app is really nice and very handy, but I need to be able to access that from my computer at work.",2,1,2019-1-5,1,0,0
"For $25 i now have home security in my apartment! There is no App Fee or ongoing charges of any kind like other companies. quality video, night vision works but wouldn't be hard to see their face and know who it is but im guessing this is the case for all night vision systems. the motion detection works great, instantly notifies me of movement or sound! There is more motion sensing options for $1.50 a month but it also comes with it, not sure the difference, maybe no delay. im using the trial now so im not sure. its comes with night vision, motion sensing, sound detection, incoming and outgoing sound, and rule programming to create your own rules, like when to come on or off, etc. would highly recommend and i looked around a lot before purchase!",5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
"I've had my wyze camera for 6 months now and I couldn't be happier. I purchased a second camera and I was having some minor issues to get the continues recording to work.

Highly recommend them.",5,1,2020-3-28,1,2,0
"I bought these because I didn't wanna spend the amount Nest was charging for there cameras and believe me, just spend the extra cash and get the nest cameras.I've had nothing but problems from day 1 with these, they never connected properly, they wouldn't turn off, no matter how many times you turn them off in the app, it would never work. I ended up getting a smart plug and plugging it into that just to get it to shut off.  And that's the issue with these, I had to do so many work around just to get them to work properly.",1,1,2019-3-1,1,0,0
"I do love the picture quality overall, the camera functions very well so far - I am a novice with this type of device so I’m still learning the ropes.  Customer service has been extremely helpful and courteous.  The only reason I gave it 4and not 5 stars for motion detection is because there have  been times it has sent me a motion notice and there has been nothing there.  The area it highlights for the motion is up high on a wall or in the middle of the room where nothing is there.  This does only happen on occasion.  I am very pleased with this product and would buy more as the need arises .  Great value for money spent!!  I have raved to my co worker who has always purchased Nest cameras a significantly higher price and she is ready to make the switch to Wyze",5,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
"For the price it can’t be beat.It is low frame rate, does not always link well, the IR lights attract bugs that turn on motion, but for the price it’s great. Hopefully they will come up with a higher quality model.",2,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0
"We have had some vehicle break-ins lately and I wanted to have something to alert me if someone was in my vehicle. I didn’t want the $50 a month service fee for an ADT or home security system so I thought I would give this a try. I mounted it outside under my roof soffit using the exterior housing case I ordered off amazon. Although it’s outside it will not get direct contact with rain, etc. I ran the power cord through the attic for a clean install. I didn’t have very high hopes for this but I am very impressed. The picture quality is outstanding and it sends me a phone alert within 2 seconds of detecting motion. The Wyze app is also very impressive. It allows you to create custom settings and camera modes. I have ordered a micro SD card to put in it but the 12 second videos currently if you do not have an SD card are great. I really like how I can see “real time” footage. If I’m at work I can open the app and see what’s going on around my house. Now I can make sure the pest control is actually doing what I’m paying for, hehe. I will be getting another one for the back porch. Very happy!",5,1,2019-1-12,1,1,1
"The picture quality is good and has a decent range, but I find it difficult to connect to a lot of the time when I'm away from home. I have to reset it multiple times and just hope that one of the times it will work. Also, DO NOT use the adhesive tape included to attach to a painted wall! Took a gigantic chunk out of my paint and dry wall when I removed it. Like 5x the size of the tape itself. Going to be a huge pain to fix. I wish I had seen a warning about this before I made that mistake, so thought it was important to leave a review about it. I'm going to try command strips in its new spot. Otherwise, I do recommend this camera for the price point.",4,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"A friend of mine suggested I give these cameras a try because I needed excessive coverage for my business due to a perceived internal theft issue.  Well, after about a day on my network and having identified an outbound data stream to Alibaba’s network in China, I elected to remove these cameras from my system... now I come to find out I was more right than I originally thought to have made this decision.On 12/26/19, the video surveillance industry news authority, IPVM.com, wrote an article blowing the lid off an even greater vulnerability.  See the article at IPVM.com by searching ‘Wyze’, or see the article which I’ve attached here as images.",2,1,2019-12-26,1,0,1
"It all started with just one. I mean for $25, you don't really have much to lose.The setup is great, download the app, select add device, add info about WiFi, hit button on camera to put it into ""Pairing Mode"" let it scan your QR code and boom setup complete. For only $25 this thing does A LOT. motion and sound detection. You can even setup the area that you want the motion to detect. Also it can listen for smoke and CO2 detection. They have free cloud storage or just add an SD card.  They just added Human detection to the software.  Now the best part about all of this is there is no month contract no free or paid tier. Its all free and all great.",5,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0
"This product does not even feel like a beta product. I was able to set it up with no issues and first impression was great but once I started using it for recording or triggering events or any other functions, you either do not get responses from the camera and it is timing out or get errors. Tried 2 different cameras with the same issue. Product might have a lot of potential due to its form factor and listed functionality but since majority of it just simply does not work, this is a useless device. Using the latest FW v4.9.4.28. WYZE, YOU NEED TO TEST THIS PRODUCT BEFORE SELLING TO PUBLIC.Also, was trying to get a hold of tech support and after being on hold for 15min, automated service announced that they are very busy and retry at a later time followed by hang up.",1,1,2019-4-22,1,0,0
"If you want a cam chances are this will do, provided that you do not care about accessing it on a computer, NAS, or basically anything but their proprietary iOS or Android app.  For me its a deal breaker, for 75% of people its probably not the end of the world.  I am not returning mine, but I am also not replacing my current equipment with a fleet of these as I anticipated.  The other very concerning aspect of Wyze cam is that it relies on WYZE unpublished API for its authentication, which mean in short, they have your username / password and access to your camera, and there isn't a lot you can do about it.  I would not recommend this for an interior camera mainly due to security concerns.",3,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0

"I've tried playing around with a couple of different types of wireless cameras and discovered that these are simply the best for my needs. Extremely easy to install, easy to set up and by far the most affordable. There are housings you can get so that you can put them outside. If you want something simple to set up and easy to move around for the interior of your house this is definitely an excellent option. For outside coverage it's a little bit more involved in regards to the wiring which is actually just one power plug but it does well outside also.",5,1,2019-3-28,1,1,0
"UPDATE*** ordered another, same thing, contacted wyze and they sent a replacement, it does the same thing. Just talked to them again and they said there are issues with the new firmware it updated to. So 3 cameras in the last week all dont work.*** We have 2 other wyze cameras just like this that we have had for over 9 months that work great.  BUT this one doesnt detect motion. Its connected and I can view live stream, and it's set to detect motion, people and send a notification, it doesn't do any of those. After I put it up yesterday i noticed it didnt send a notification, so I went up to it this morning right in front walked by, waved my hand and put my face right in front and nothing....all settings were turned on just like my others that work fine.",1,1,2019-10-28,1,0,1
"This camera was so easy to set up. It took about 5 min total. No hassle at all. I'm also happy with the video quality in both daytime & night vision modes.I wish it recorded a few seconds before the motion triggers recording, but overall the function is fine. You can get an SD card & do continuous recording, but for my use I didn't think it was necessary.",5,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0
"I have 6 of them, 3 purchased from Amazon (which would not sell me more) and 3 from Wyzecam.com which sells them at a price with shipping that is similar to the Amazon Prime price.  Four of my cameras are now installed and all are working well.  Setup was easy - all you need is a smartphone.  The video is clear and bright, though the lens focal length is a bit wider than I would really like.  Sound is OK if the person is near the camera, otherwise it can be just a weird warbling noise.  With micro-SD cards installed in each camera I have continuous 10fps 1080p recordings.  The cloud video is based on 10-second clips of motion or sound detection (if you elect to enable these), and videos and images during cloud playback can't be screen-enlarged as with the micro-SD card recordings.  But 14 days of free rolling storage of these clips in the cloud for each camera, free, is the best deal I've ever heard of.There are several reasons I'm giving this product 5 stars.  First - the cams work fairly reliably, which is more than I can say for two other brands of security cams that I've owned, Kodak and Zmodo. The Wyze cams need to be restarted on occasion for reasons I don't understand and I don't like that, but even so they are more reliable than the previous brands.  The live videos and the videos from the memory cards are very sharp and retain useful information even after moderate screen enlargement (spreading your fingers apart on the screen).  The price is unbeatable.  But now that I see the quality of these cams, I would have paid more.",5,1,2018-2-12,1,0,0
"UPDATE:Needed to get a footage to review, I use 128gb sd card and it works great, however my problem is video quality, even though it is HD all videos are super blurry and not so pleasant, yes it is cheap $25 camera, but actual videos look like just zoomed in crappy 720 resolution... very disappointed",2,1,2019-7-6,1,1,1
"I have spent over $100 a piece for other well known cameras that proved mostly worthless to me. This Wyze Cam works amazingly well at my location with my old cable WiFi router. The picture quality is superior to my expensive cameras. It recovers well after a power outage and the focus is great. For the price and performance, I love this thing.The only down side for me is that it is powered from 5V USB. My previous cams were 12V powered. Minor thing.",2,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"Absolutely LOVE this camera. We needed a baby monitor and just for a sound monitor we were looking at spending $26 at least so we purchased this camera and the sound, picture quality, and camera quality were all amazing. It’s also very easy to move around so if I put our baby in a different room I can just move the camera. If we got to someone else’s house I can also just take it with us and everything is through an app on your phone so you don’t have to take a bunch of items it’s just the camera and cord. Keep in mind this camera has to stay plugged into an outlet at all times. The camera does have a little stand so you can raise it up and it will stand. The camera is also very light weight. If I could give it more stars I would. Best purchase made. You can also purchase more than one camera and see all of the surveillance on one screen.",5,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0
"First, this is a really good camera, especially for the price. But, the limited 12 second video recording does not offer a lot of video time. After that 12 second period, there is a ""cool down"" period where nothing is recorded. So, I decided to get a Micro SD card and use it for internal storage, which allows you to record up to 1 min of video. After several failed attempts for the SD Card to work, I kept getting a message saying the SD Card could not be recognized. So, I checked it in my PC and the new card did work. I have submitted a question to their Customer Support and I am waiting on that for further assistance. If the SD Card Slot will not work, I will be returning the camera and going with another brand.",3,1,2019-7-15,1,2,0
"I ordered 3 of these cameras because the price was very reasonable. I only opened 1 package to test them before opening the others. The camera works well but I didn’t know there would be a monthly fee for playback until I received a notice a week later.

"We like this product.  Very easy to access the camera at our sitter’s house and at our house from anywhere. The screen is clear and were able to see the eyes of my child if they are open.  The one thing I don’t like about it Is not very stable.  The camera sits on a very unstable mount.  The camera itself is much heavier than the mount it self so if you tilted it forward to get the best view of your child, it actually wouldn’t sit very well.  Due to the heaviness of the camera, it might actually fall over.  We had it positioned on a shelf above and to the side of the crib but it fell and landed in the crib. And by the time my child was nine months and could stand in her crib she was pulling it down very easily. We still did not want to buy a wall mounted version,  so we set it up higher on the sound machine and taped it. It has worked like a charm. Very awkward though.",4,1,2019-4-19,1,1,0
"Bought this on a whim, price was so cheap how could I not. Live in a rural area and put this in the garage. Easy set up. Added an sd card I had laying around to make this an exceptional security device. Sensitive detection detects sound and motion even the garage door opener light turning off. Sends notifications to my phone. If you’re on the fence get it. Good quality, and great for piece of mind. Fun too, with the mic/speaker, it’s fun to scare people when you know they’re coming over. Plan on getting another for inside the house to watch the dog. Maybe an outdoor one as well. Having to plug it in probably doesn’t make it easy to hide but that is not my intention. Good for keeping an eye on things when not home.",5,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"We got this as a cheap security camera for our garage as we live on a highly trafficked ally way and want to make sure nobody gets into our garage while we're out and about. We've had this camera for about a month now and I really have zero major complaints. It is really easy to setup and install, it has good video quality, the Wyze app is super easy to use, and over all it ""just works"".One thing I love is that it can notify you when it spots motion or hears loud noises. However, if I were to nitpick, I'd mention that the motion tracking has no smarts to distinguish between ""real"" motion and just random things. So often I'll wake up in the morning to many notifications of motion because a moth was flying around the garage and reflecting a ton of the IR signals when the camera was on night vision mode. Not a big problem, but slightly annoying.",5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"Very easy to connect to the app and set up around the house. Might need a cover if you plan to install it outside and expose to the elements. Video quality is very good. Night vision is also good. I put it on top of the garage door facing the drive way, and then set detection area to close to the house, so it doesn't pick up everything. Email notifications comes with about a minute delay, so don't expect instant notification. Reviewing recorded events is very easy with the app. I put in a 64GB micro SD card and set to extend the recording (not continuous recording), so I have both the 12-second notification and extended recording, if I want to review on SD card. Only downside on night mode is the front led (infrared?) attracts bugs which trigger the motion sensing occasionally. In day time, movement of my palm tree's shadow on driveway also triggers the sensor.The speaker and mic are interesting features to have, but don't expect too much of it.There is always statics. So this is probably not a replacement of the more expensive (Ring), which I haven't used it yet. If the sound quality is better, I'll give it 5 stars.",4,1,2018-8-28,1,0,0
"Love this device. I purchased an aftermarket mount to put it outside by our front door. Looove being able to watch the front yard, watch for packages, etc..The motion detection is great. Too great. Even at low sensitivity, the shadow from our flag out front would send motion notifications to my phone. Raccoons and neighborhood cats were setting it off. Headlights driving by. I couldn't have the notifications on to let me know when the mail came, packages, etc. I just did a Firmware update a couple days ago though and in that process Wyze offered me ""Person Detection."" Now THAT is much more like it. Now, anytime a person walks up/down my porch steps I get a notification.  It's fantastic!! No more ""motion"" notification about all the things I don't even care about. lol.",5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0

But it does not pick up people!! There is a giant greasy hand print on my car and no video to show who wiped their greasy hands on my car. If my ex has been here, it hasn't recorded it. For someone on unpaid maternity leave, this is a huge waste of money and dosappointment. I got this gor mine and my baby's safety yet it can't recognize people moving?? Don't waste your money!!

"I don’t understand why I have to pay for a premium account after already purchasing the product. That’s ridiculous. Also, for the price I paid, I would have expected a much better device. The HD setting looks exactly like the SD. No difference whatsoever (except that HD will make your camera and phone lag tremendously). Night vision is super grainy. The magnetized bottom isn’t great, so mounting can be difficult, especially since the sticker for the bottom barely sticks to anything.If you don’t pay for the upgraded account, they only allow 12 second videos upon detection, and they don’t even record every time there is movement.

Other times, I only get notifications if the screen is on. Yet other times, I would hear several notifications in rapid succession when the screen is off. I've observed the same pattern accross multiple phones and tablets. This means I basicially would have to have a device's screen  constantly on in order for this product to be effective.I don't know about you, but receiving notifications that an intruder is in my home (i.e., motion detection) is the main reason I bought this device.

"Amazing technology built into a tiny package, not to mention no recurring fees and basically unlimited storage on the micro SD card! I ended up integrating it into my front door trim to make it look like a custom camera (see pic.) I drew power from an extra pair of wires that went to the doorbell (I did this a few years ago when remodeling the house and boy did it come in handy!) The power supply that came with the camera was not powerful enough for the 25' run to the power source so I found an old 5v/1.5 amp LG smartphone charger in my drawer and it worked perfectly. As long as the voltage is the same and amperage meets the lowest on the original power supply, it will work fine. Higher amperage is AOK, just ""not enough"" is bad for the cam and will eventually kill it. Anyhow, enjoy these little guys. They rock!",5,1,2019-9-29,1,0,1
"Can't say enough good things about these small cameras. Been using it for 6 months now and it does not stop to amaze me that you can get this amount of tech and quality for such a low price. Seriously, do not even consider any of the high-end cameras like Nest or Ring, there is really no point. Do they have fancy features that you will never use other than a demo to your friends? yes. But nothing beats demoing this camera and app to the friend that just spent 10x $$$ to get exactly the same features that you paid $25 for.If you want to drive the point home, remind him that with these small things you get 14 days free cloud storage and you don't need to pay a monthly fee for something you were supposed to get with the device you bought at a premium price.",5,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0

Overall this thing is a great value for the money and I will probably be getting another one to have even more coverage.  It's great at detecting even the slightest bit of motion and has a clear picture.  I wish it had a learning type mode where it could emit detecting motion of plants moving in the breeze...etc.  the person detection is not reliable.  I have it set to alert me if it detects a person and sometimes I can walk right by it and it doesn't detect.  But for $25 bucks it's worth it.  They have a reporting feature to try to improve their person detection.  I usually report clips where it should have seen someone.  Who knows maybe they will improve the software and it will work great in that aspect.,4,1,2019-9-12,1,0,0
My brother introduced me to these awesome cameras!! Picture quality is amazing and comes with everything you need to mount the camera. Night camera works better if you have a light on since it’s placed inside looking out of a window I can’t use the built in night vision mode. Love this option of camera that can be easily moved around for under $30 would keep purchasing over and over highly recommend for everyone. This is a great piece of mind for the price.

"Low cost, high quality of product and support (wrestled with some network issues that have long since been resolved in updates). Experience on par with eero and, honestly, way better than Ring. The magnetic base is a great touch - it's plenty strong. I've moved these cameras around all over, and as long as they're in my wifi range and near an outlet, they just plain work. Used them to monitor feral cat traps (TNR) and as kitten cams for fosters. When I go on trips I put one at the pet dishes so I can check in randomly to ensure everyone's been eating. When I've had to get samples for the vet, one aimed at the litter boxes can alert any time they're used, and I can see exactly where the right patient has left something solid (ick, I know, but an elegant solution to an otherwise logistical nightmare).No subscription nonsense, easy seeking for motion sensed/recorded events going back weeks (depends on the size of your SD card, but the files are not huge). Picture quality is very clear, even in the dark. Wyze has made a beautiful, simple product and they don't charge a fortune for it.",5,1,2019-7-25,1,0,0

So far so good. I mean I just put it up since receiving it today. I have the new version that monitors the house and can pan but this one stays stationary monitoring my front door. It’s a good alternative to the expensive ring doorbells. I paid only $5 as a deal with Amazon’s Alexa Show. I like that it detects movement and records it. It has room for a SD card but I don’t have a need for it yet. It’s nice that it’s available. I’m not sure how the sound quality if with this one and I won’t be using the 2-way sound. The sound quality isn’t great with the newer model so I can’t imagine this one would be.

"I cannot believe that this camera is as low priced as it is. It’s easy to set up and great picture quality. I was going to buy a cheap 4 camera setup at Harbor Freight until I found this. I’m so glad I did. This camera blows away that system and many others at several times the price. Add a micro sd card and it’s almost perfect. I can’t think of a better option for twice the price. I truly do wish it was RTSP compliant without having to jump through hoops and lose other functionality.  This should be an easy “switch” option like motion detection is. Motion detection and person detection work great! My only complaint is the lack of RTSP compatibility. I would also love to see a battery powered or solar option in the future. Weather proofing options would be nice too but now I’m just nitpicking. Buy it, you won’t regret it.",5,1,2019-9-21,1,0,0

I'm also having a hard time figuring out how to get it to playback but it seems you might be forced to get a memory card for that option even though it seemed like it's supposed to store to the cloud for 14 days(?)

"I am now wondering why I spent all those endless hours researching security cameras. I gave up and decided to go with this camera thinking I had little to lose. Boy, am I glad I did!!!!  This camera is absolutely fantastic. It breaks every rule about you get what you pay for.  The functionality of this system exceeds even the $300+ security cameras. 1. It is very easy to set up, and the install process worked flawlessly, It even has voice feedback to let you know things are on track!  2. Invest an extra $10 for the microSD card.  It will extend recording times to continuous surveillance or motion activated with continuous surveillance while there is motion/sound activity.  Motion/sound events are also sent to the phone app so you get a 15s alert of motion/sound activity. These app alerts can be toggled off, but all surveillance activity is stored onto the card for playback in the event you need to review. You can choose sections of recorded activity on the card to send to your phone or email.  3. I was blown away with the clarity of both the visual and sound. Night vision is superb. The field of view is very good, and tracking distance impressive ( across to neighbors house). 4. It seems very stable with wifi connection.  I have had the camera only for a few days, but it has never dropped out yet, even in rain. Besides, even if one does lose wifi or cell phone connection, the camera still records events to the SD card as long it is getting power!  As I said, I can't believe it does all this for less than $50.Minor caveats:  1. Some of the text on the app is difficult for me to read (getting older). I wish text/symbols could be  BW instead of gray or a tiny bit larger. 2. Some people may find the USB power a limitation.  I bought a 25' USB cable to bring the adapter into the garage outlet.  But having looked at other options, I think it is better than rechargeable batteries, especially since I want to record continuously during motion events. This can run down a battery very fast. 3. As far as spying goes, I do not care if it can not be turned off. I want continuous surveillance! I do not want to worry about whether the cam has been turned off. 4. I would like to be able to access the camera from a web browser as well as my cell phone, but this is a very minor limitation becasue the phone app (iOS) is really fantastic and works very well ( other than text not being easy to see).",5,1,2019-3-26,1,0,0
**edit** Was not charged a fee to return. I have to add that Wyze customer service is excellent. I wish it had worked out***I never could get the camera to record automatically. The only time it would record is if I pushed the record button. I need it for security where it will record like it’s supposed to. Tech support told me to download a file in the micro sd card. They said once it was installed it would solve my problem. It didn’t. Now I can’t get it to do anything. It’s just a flashing blue light. I believe I read that they charge you a restocking fee to send it back. So it’s probably not even worth it. Disappointed,1,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"The camera is easy to install thru the app and worked well at first.  Then a few weeks later the camera is no longer able to be viewed on my cellular connection thru my iphone.  I'm not alone with this issue, I did multiple searches to find others having the same issues.  I have never touched a setting or even done a firmware update since installing the camera.  Why would the camera work fine for a few weeks over AT&t network and then stop.  What good is a security camera if I can only view it from my home wifi network?  I want to be able to access the camera while I'm away, there is no reason to view it while I'm at home.Edit, the above issue was resolved by Wyze.  They realized the problem and was able to get it repaired.  The camera is now working with our cellular network after about a week of disruption.",4,1,2019-2-28,1,0,0
"For the features of this device at this cost, there are no major complaints. I replaced my multiple DLink cameras with Wyze and I am very impressed.  These cams do offer better motion detection than my other cams.  The add-on person detection does reduce alerts for light changes, cats and insect movements. Cams are clear up close but background images are a bit fuzzy.  The Android app works well and is much quicker responding when compared to my DLink interface.  I really enjoy the 14-day free cloud storage. By having cloud storage, I can turn off my ftp server.  I also enjoy using night vision through a window since I can turn off the IR LEDs.  I can see other improvements being made or needed but at this price there isn't anything to complain about.",5,1,2019-8-18,1,0,0
"i got these to test them out.  For a $25 camera, i guess you get what you pay for.  Quality seems good. i have two of them and they are pointing outside.  They work great.  picture is pretty good.  my only gripe about them is the cool down. it takes 5 mins until the next motion is detected before it will record again. I would like to see this lowered or maybe made customization.  trying to catch the person who keeps letting their dog crap in my yard, and i'm afraid that if a car goes by before they do....i'll miss it.  so needless to say, it kinda sucks on that point and thus the 2 stars. hope the developers one day make this change, until then, everything is great except for the cool down.",2,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"I bought the Wyze Sense Starter Kit from Wyze directly since you cannot buy this separately from Amazon. I have written Wyze about 17 times. They did replace a faulty Wyze Sense Motion sensor (external sensor). However about one out of 6 times an Alexa routine is not triggered by the Wyze ridge. It does record the video and I get a Wyze notification. I have sent screenshots, log files and had about 3 tickets just asking for a new bridge to be sent to me. No response. I am very disappointed. Just want a new bridge/hub or send me a new camera and hub and I will pay the postage to send it back. Very sad. I do not need them to reach out to me per a reply or comment I want action and a replacement. It now sits in a drawer.",1,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"Amazing.  I had an old camera that needed constant updating and was a pain to set up and had no alerts.  This was so easy....get the app, plug in....3 or 4 steps and go.  I have it positioned at my front door and I can see my garage door (which I always wonder if I shut...so now I can check) and down my back hall that catches the garage entrance and another.  The motion and person detection is excellent and the sound detection will tell me if a smoke  alarm is going off.  I will only activate the detections when I am away but it’s super easy on my cell phone.

"This is great, goes well with the rest of my Wyze set up. Only thing I really dislike is the magnetic mount that is connected to the wall mount. I don't have a lot of confidence in  the connection. The Wyze cam pan has a great Wall mount, but the wall mount for the Wyze cam is not great, it seems like it will fall at any moment.If you're not hanging it on the wall, your just going to have it stands on a flat surface I believe this is a great second camera.",3,1,2019-8-18,1,1,0
It's astonishing/refreshing how much utility can be delivered for a minimal cost. The technology is clever. The setup astonishingly easy. I have purchased a number of these for personal use and gifts to others. I prefer the basic Wyze Cam V2 over the more 'feature packed' Pan-Cam. The basic unit is more compact and automated panning/motion tracking is a mixed blessing in many cases.I totally recommend the series of intro/setup/feature videos available at the Wyze Cam website.,5,1,2018-12-19,1,0,0
"So I set up the Wyze camera next to my Nest camera in my living room when I first took it out of the box. The screen captures show there is very similar video quality. The Nest is the atandrd indoor camera, not the IQ. I did pay 179 each for these Nest cameras and very impressed at the Wyze camera for only twenty bucks. If you examine the two pictures closely, it appears the Nest has a slightly bigger field of view, but upon zooming in, the Wyze has slightly better picture quality. Zoom in to the picture hanging on the wall in the left of the picture. You can read it on the Wyze photo and cannot read it on the Nest photo. Dark is where the Wyze falls down. The Nest does a fair job at night vision. As you can see here, the Wyze camera can see the plant next to it but the room is black. Definitely a cost saver for an entry level camera. I’m impressed. If I didn’t already own 10 Nest cameras I would buy all Wyze cameras instead. As I add to my system I will be adding Wyze cameras.",4,1,2019-3-1,1,0,1

I'm a Design engineer, and I like simple beautiful clean-line design.  Also, amazon Return policy is the best.  Easy setup.  Working perfectly.  An improvement is that the cord should be 10-15 feet to accommodate various installation options (I had to buy longer cord).For price and quality, there is nothing out there that comes close.  I highly recommend the WyzeCam, a beautiful product.",5,1,2017-11-27,1,3,0
"Initially I was not able to access the night vision and gave the product one star.  That was because the product comes with zero information.  Attempts to contact the company were not successful.  However, after finding the right button to push, it now works pretty well.  It would be nice if there was a way to access the camera on your PC, watching long term on a cell phone is a pain.  My next issue is that Wyze says the image is stored on the Cloud, if so, I have no idea how to access it.  Once you disconnect the power, you can't access previous images, as far as I can tell.  Not great if you are using the camera for security and the thief steals the camera and internal memory card.  Maybe I will stumble on the answer to that problem.  Also, it would be nice if they would make an outdoor version.  The covers that are marketed by other suppliers are not weatherproof.",4,1,2019-5-24,1,0,0

I figured for about $25, this would be the first one I'd try.  Thankfully, the search is over!  The night vision is creepy good, as is the regular picture.  There's a normal lag in audio of a couple seconds - it's not an intercom, it's going through wifi.  Honestly, we just installed a Nest system at work, and while those cameras have great quality, you receive nearly the same thing - even the same mounting - for 1/10th the price.

"I have a ring camera, a nest and one of these Wyze cameras. It’s the worst! Set-up was easy but glitchy. It’s supposed to send you “person” alerts but I haven’t received one alert since I set it up. You have to active look at what you want to see in real time and that about all you get. And you have to upload the real time image which doesn’t always work or takes forever then you miss what you want to see. It’s basically an extra set of eyes (glitchy at that) with zero perks or features. On top of that, the app DRAINS your phone battery so bad. I’ve never had worse battery than I do now. I might just delete the app and toss this in the rubbish honestly. It’s just doesn’t do anything even for the 17$ I paid. Would rather pay more and have a great camera like my Ring or Nest.

"Short version: I love this camera. At this price point it is completely untouchable. Just buy it.Long version: I just installed this camera (it replaced a Phylink camera, which was overpriced garbage), and so far, I am extremely impressed. For the paltry sum that they're asking, you get at least 90% of the quality and features of the big boy cameras for 90% less dollarydoos. The installation process is basically foolproof as long as you know how to use a smartphone. I slapped a 128GB microSD card in the Wyze, which it happily formatted and is using despite not ""officially"" supporting one of that size.

Many great things are in Beta right now and you’ll get those with no fees as well.,5,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0
"I was a little skeptical after reading some of the 1-star reviews. I took a chance by buying 2 cameras first, thinking I don't have much to lose. I currently have a Ring floodlight camera and another set of wireless 1080p security camera that cost at least 7-8 times more. After setting up my 2 Wyze cameras, I found out the picture quality is excellent. I am impressed that I can turn on the voice and listen to the sound in real time and talk back (although it is not as good as Ring camera which cost $200 each. Occasionally it lost the connection at start up, but after a tap on refresh icon, 9 out of 10 times I have no problem to stream video right away. It is the biggest bang for the bucks I spent. I just bought one more camera, since I like this little smart security camera so much and they are so affordable. I hope the comany is here to stay. BTW, I like Wyze camera app. It is better than IP Pro app for my other security camera system.  In the future, if we can stream video on desktop (not just smart phone app), that will be even better. For now, it is the best value out there for similar product line.",5,1,2019-4-24,1,0,1

The downside of this camera is that it is not integrated with Google assistant, so you can not ask Google to show you a specific room.

I set scheduled times for the camera to turn on and off and it worked fine in that time frame. Now, all I get is an error code saying to reboot the camera.

The live feed connection is very stable and is able to run for hours at a time.  I also found the software to be intuitive and fast.  My only gripe is the sound quality; it's not that great and is noticeably worse than the Arlo Pro, but it's good enough for my purpose.

Seems to go off when there is nothing there, like when the sun creates a shadow or light and when a light in the hallways goes on. I guess being sensitive to anything is better than not picking up motion. It definitely goes off when my cat goes in and out of the area. The unit itself gets really warm, almost hot but read reviews that say it is ok. I unplug it when I am home for the most part, let it cool down.

I absolutely LOVE how you can turn on the sound to hear who's there and that they can year you, too. I've already had to adjust the sensitivity a couple of times because of the neighbor cat running across the porch, but that's not a big deal. I purchased a 32gb memory card to hold info, but it's easy enough to look at the 15 sec clips and erase them immediately. For now I have the camera propped up on the brick edge above our front door, but I did purchase a holder that I will have my hubby attach to the wall (I also need to look into finding a cover for the outlet it's plugged into so that a potential thief can't run off with the whole kit-and-kaboodle).

"Great price, great picture quality, really like the app interface, love the 14 days of free storage, but the motion and people detection features are lacking.We bought this camera when a package went missing after it was supposedly delivered to our front door. Lo and behold, the day after we installed this camera, the missing package appeared on our front porch. The only problem: the app for this camera showed a whole bunch of ""Motion"" events for the day, but not one of the events showed anyone near our door. Recording events are stored online for up to 14 days, but each event's recording is only 12 seconds long and there appears to be a forced delay between each event. Fortunately, I had installed a 16 GB SD card in the camera, so we were able to go back through the day's recordings to try to find out what happened. Unfortunately, that turned out to be quite the tedious process. The app is not well suited for viewing a day's worth of recordings, so I had to pull the SD card out of the camera and download the recordings onto my laptop. Then we found that every minute of video is stored in a separate file on the SD card. It took a bit of Googling to figure out how in the world we could watch a day's worth of video without having to click through every minute of video for the entire day. It turns out the easiest way to view these files in order is to open the directory for a day's recordings in VLC, then increase the play speed to 64x. Once we finally got that going, it only took about 15 minutes of watching the day's video recordings fly by to find one of our neighbors dropping the missing package on our porch. I don't know why, but the camera completely failed to detect the neighbor's motion or his face. The little green squares in the captured video (which indicate areas of motion) were entirely focused on a tree near the edge of the picture.",4,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0

"At a price tag less than 30 dollars. There is nothing to dislike about this. I have a very small apartment in NYC, the reason why I wanted a camera was because my living room has a door to a courtyard which can easily be accessed. The two doors are decent and would prevent break-ins but even still my land lord caught one guy trying to pick the lock. I brought this camera and put it faceing the door. The motion and sound detector are more than adequate. It can pick up my roommate from next door dramatic role playing on Dungeons and dragons, and slight movements. Alerts are fast and enable playback to ""events"" so you may decide if you should run home or call for services. I was doubtful of this product, but I am very pleased so far.

"I absolutely love these!  I installed 3 on my home exterior under the eaves.  We have power outlets close by (these cameras need power) and were able to hide the wire under the siding.  I bought a 32GB SD card for each one and one of the outdoor covers (on Amazon).  They work great and picture is awesome!  Sound isn’t that great (with the cover on) but I don’t want the sound anyway.  The 32GB card records for days and you can playback from the app so you don’t have to remove the card (which would be a pain).  You can set it to record on motion only or all the time.  The one I have at my front door only records on motion (when someone comes to door) and I get a notification of motion.  You can also adjust the area of motion detection on the app, which is great to minimize false motion from cars driving by or trees moving in wind.  If they are outside (like mine) they should be near a window to pick up your wifi signal.  I have one on my lanai and also have wifi Alexa speakers so I put a wifi range extender in my garage.

The motion detection is great too. You can set an area to detect. If there is motion outside of the “zone”, no alert. The moment motion crosses into the “zone” a green box appears on your device’s screen alerting you to exactly what is causing the alert. Motion detection only records a 12 second clip, but I highly recommend purchasing and installing an SD card for longer recordings (set it to record constantly).

"Just got the cam and tested it quickly. At the beginning I connected it to my home wifi was high pic delay about 5sec and very slow. After reading some negative reviews I decided to keep it inside my garage and connected it to my guest wifi so there is no access to my home network and the delay became less almost 0.5 sec to nothing. The cam with HD is using 60 -120kb/sec. the night vesion is great, I attached some pictures for my garge with the night vesion (this is at night with no lights at all) and you can see how much I can zoom. The app is easy to use however there is no optiin to change the app notification sound and it doesnt send you a message so you will not notice the notification if you are busy. There is a delay in notifications so you will not catch things immediately. For three hours use  there is no connection issue so far but I will update if Inwill face any issue. Overall, the cam is not bad for the price at all, but keep it for external use to be in safe side if you concern anout your privacy.",4,1,2018-12-10,1,0,1

The installation was easy and fast, and the picture quality is very good, and it picks up any time someone gets near the door of my house. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because compared to other motion sensor cameras, Wyze takes up to a full minute to alert me to any potential activity, which makes it impossible for me to record anything longer than the automatic 12-second recording that occurs.

I just inserted the micro SD card, held down the setup button for 20 seconds, and -- 30 minutes later -- the camera is still stuck on a solid yellow light.  If course, when I try to submit a ticket via the app, I suddenly get an ""internet failure"" error message when trying to submit (my internet is fine).  Leaving this review up in the hopes that someone reaches out to fix this camera that I got to use for all of 4 minutes.",1,1,2020-8-13,1,1,0
"I use this on my porch to catch whomever has been stealing out of my car. I purchased the outdoor skin to put over it and it's held up for a while now amongst rain, snow, wind, etc. It has a really great picture during the day and at night. The only downside is that I get notifications for EVERYTHING even though I have it set to only give me notifications for what's in a certain parameter. It doesn't seem to listen to that and notifies me of everything anyway. So I will get notifications every time a car passes our house. But for less than 30.00 I feel it's worth it.",5,1,2019-1-4,1,1,0
"During the set-up Process there is a QR Code which is a necessary step in setting up the camera. Unfortunately, this step was not functioning as intended. I was therefore unable to complete the set-up process to get the camera working. They have a customer service telephone number, which isn't staffed...no answer. They also have email support in which you receive an automated response, which assigns a customer ticket # and states Wyze customer service will respond within 5-6 days?? Doesn't help when you are experiencing set-up issues!! Returned the Wyze Cam, & cannot recommend this camera what-so-ever!!",1,1,2019-1-12,1,1,0
"After 4 years of buying baby monitors and something always going wrong eventually, we decided to try this system. It was cheap and worked with an echo show so it was worth a shot. It’s amazing! And beyond worth the money. We ordered 3 (two for baby & toddler rooms, one for our playroom). Two set up flawlessly - hardly a video delay (maybe 1-2 seconds) and super clear picture. The third one had a major delay so I returned it immediately as I could tell it was a defect (since the other two worked so well) and they sent me a new one immediately, before even receiving my broken one. The new one worked great and has continued to serve as our baby monitors since August 2018. We have a new baby arriving next month and I am about to order one for his room as well.My only negative when originally purchasing is that you cannot remotely move the camera which is helpful with a toddler, but now they have the pan/tilt version which I might try.",5,1,2018-12-9,1,0,0
I replaced my YI dome camera with this as its software was not quite buggy. This is working very well. Very accurate and fast notifications. It is easy to mount anywhere either though magnetic base or provided sticky thingy.It is capable of recording locally and it provides free 12 sec video clips as motion notifications from cloud compared to 6 second YI notifications.,5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"The product, like most, has pros and cons. The picture quality looks good when zoomed out, but when you zoom in much at all, it’s gets blurry and pixelated looking. There is two way audio but on ours it’s staticky and cuts in and out and you can’t understand what the person speaking thru the app is saying to you. It’s good for just keeping an eye on things but I think when we get more cameras, they will actually have two way audio that works, and better picture quality.",3,1,2019-12-13,1,1,0
"I love these cameras! My only complaint is that occasionally they freeze up and need to be unplugged and then plugged in but the value these cams provide is amazing! Image quality far exceeded my expectation!!!  Just wish the automatic clips that are motion activated/recorded were long enough to be useful. They're just too short to see what's going on. Only that something is starting to happen. For example, my cat enters the frame, the camera starts recording.  A few seconds later, that's it. You only see that the cat entered the frame. You don't see it go to the potted plant and pee. Another example, my kid comes into the kitchen and activates the camera to start recording. I get to see him get a glass of water. What I don't get to see is the entire bag of cookies he eats directly afterward. I try to use SD cards but for some reason, while mine worked for a few weeks, it doesn't work anymore. Not sure if that's a problem with the SD card or the unit.",4,1,2018-2-27,1,1,0
I bought 3 of these last year in September to help keep an eye on my children to make sure they are safe and aren't misbehaving. After owning these cameras for 8 months now I thought I would leave a review. The cameras have excellent picture clarity and can be used to speak through using the wyze app. Switching between cameras only take a few seconds and they must be connected to wifi in order to work. You can also record some video on them with an sd card.The only negative thing I have to say about these cameras is that the sound does not always work when you speak through them with the app. Most of the time the sound comes out distorted and garbled. Other times the sound comes out clear. It is very hit or miss with the sound.,5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"I read and re-read all the reviews and product descriptions, and was left thinking you only get 12 seconds of footage each time there's a motion alert. That's true, but you can then look at the time on the live-stream page and scroll back through the footage and watch it all in real time (more than 12 seconds worth). That would have sold me on the product if I'd have known that. I just figured the low price was worth the risk. And I have an SD card in it, so maybe that's why it works for me but not all the other reviewers??Good product so far. And they're clearly becoming well known.

"Not happy with the techs of the product at all. Customer service procedures needs improvement, difficulty speaking to an actual person to try and resolve the 'connection' issues.

"If I could give this product zero stars I absolutely would. First of all, i was never able to set it up. It kept saying it was unable to find my WiFi. So after 30 minutes I gave up and hadn’t tried again. Fast forward to tonight at 1 am. I’m sitting on my couch reading a book and start hearing what initially sounded like a water drop. I set down my book and then suddenly I heard a sequence of the same sound and it realized it was tongue clicks.... COMING FROM THE CAMERA THAT I FAILED TO SET UP. I freaked out and ran into my bedroom to wake up my husband who immediately unplugged it and set it in a drawer. I have never felt so vulnerable and exposed in my entire life. This camera had obviously connected itself to our WiFi and was on without my knowledge and who knows for how long as days had elapsed since I initially tried to set it up. Needless to say I will be returning this camera first thing tomorrow morning.",1,1,2019-3-7,1,2,0
"Aside from all the security concerns outlined in the top reviews, this camera is actually great. It's considerably more compact than I expected and the setup was a breeze. Very user friendly if you follow the simple step by step instructions.  Video quality is great for about 30 feet, optical zoom is meh, what you would expect from a inexpensive camera.  The motion/sound tagging works well. I was particularly impressed with the option to detect and alert for smoke alarms and other loud noises. Power cable is bit short. I have mine setup with a Wemo switch that turns on/off when I leave my home for extended periods. I suspect the repeated power interrupts will burn it out at some point but being so cheap they are easy to replace. Purchasing a second one for my porch.",5,1,2018-7-5,1,1,0
"I have two Wyze cameras that I have used for several months. Had good results with them, although the quality if not as good as two Nest cameras I also use.I received this unit a couple of days ago, and it was bad out of the box. No WiFi range.

"I bought this camera to monitor the progress of my 3D printer.  I am impressed with the image quality, particularly at only a few inches from the lens.  The magnetic mount is very handy - it took me 15 seconds to find a place on the printer frame to attach it and get decent status images.  I am going to take a little time to find an optimal mounting position, but for now, this works great.  The picture shows the start of a print.I already had a Wyze camera, so adding it to the app took a couple of button clicks.",5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,1

Those cameras have been running for a few months and are doing great.  I'm very impressed.Keep in mind that they must be connected to a power source.  That can have some limitations on where and how you locate them.

"I've had two of the WYZE cameras for close to a year now and I see things I had no idea was going on in my yard such as a doe on my back patio, a fawn in the same place the next day, a police car out in front stopped at 2am. I could go on and on but you get the idea. Without the cameras I would have no idea things were going on at night (or day) around my home.  Most are unimportant but some are not. I also have ADT and have had that system for over 20 years but there are no cameras with it and I don't want to spend the money to add them especially since WYZE catches most everything anyway. They were very easy to install and set up. I have one looking out my back window and one overlooking the porch. They recently added a 'person' recognizing feature and I love it. For the low cost of the purchase and no added costs who could ask for anything more. Thanks WYZE.",5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,1
"I love this product and the company which makes it. Wyze cameras offer so many features that help you use the camera to it's fullest capability. I have 3 cameras constantly recording exits/entrances to my house so I have full security of my home and they're been working perfectly. This camera is the most basic form the company sells but it does it's job very well. The cameras offer an app that allows you to view the cameras and their recording at any time, making our job a whole lot easier! If you have any issues with the product or it wears over time (which mine hasn't), you can contact their support and they fix the issue very quickly and easily. 10/10 for the product!",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
I purchased this to keep in my apartment because we are having trust issues with the management and this is awesome it picks up my dog barking and notifies me.

I haven’t figured out every function and I don’t know if u have to keep it plugged in or not but so far I’ve just kept it plugged in. Way better price than the ones I was originally looking at.

"I have six Wyze Cameras, two Pans and four Cams.  They all were easy to set up and work fine given the inherent limitations of a $20 camera.  I also have three Blink cameras (which cost 5 times as much) and I prefer the Wyze for indoor use.  Note, the Wyze is not designed for outdoor use. You can buy housing to protect from the elements but the infrared lights for night use are designed for indoors and may not cover enough area for you with outdoor night time use.  That is not what the are designed for.  Wyze is apparently coming out with an outdoor camera this year. Most of the issues that people have are due to router or interference issues. You would probably face the same problem with other cameras using WiFi. Just check out the forums dealing with Blink and Ring. I also have the Wyze sensors and motion detector and they work  great in combination with the Cam.",4,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"It's an okay camera and has worked so far. The picture quality isn't the best, and it doesn't have the best support for SD cards, but it does work. I mainly needed a camera suddenly due to an expensive package arriving not long after I ordered it. It does record based on motion, but it doesn't seem to detect motion all that well. If someone walks in front of it for a few seconds, it'll pick them up, but if they're quick, it won't catch a thing. Aside from that, there are privacy concerns with this camera.

I see notifications from both locations and have tested such notifications by moving within view.  Cost is low and quality of the video is more than adequate.  I have microSD cards in both and have access to a week of video.

I've found I can resolve this issue by disconnecting camera, deleting app from phone, and reinstalling everything...and voila, it's all back and working as expected.

I have several of them, and can see what's going on in the yard and get notified of motion in the house even if I'm on the other side of the county.  They are not weatherproof, so if you want to use them outside you have to carefully choose where you mount them. I mounted one outside under an eave and it lasted for months until a hurricane finally took it out. The metal connection points rust. The manufacturer is explicit in saying they are not designed for outdoor use.",5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"If I could give this a 3.5 I would. I was told you would be able to see color with this except in night vision,  but you cant. You can speak into it but good luck trying to understand what the person is saying. Picture quality is just OK. If you are looking for something just to peak in on your house or a room from time to time it's ok.

"Great quality security camera that's super cheap to own. The camera fits in the palm of your hand and is very easy to set up and install. They mount via a magnetic mount that you nail onto a wall so it's a breeze to mount. Video quality during the day is clear in HD but for night vision is alright for a certain range as it's infrared. Motion detection is spot on and can be tuned to be extremely sensitive as well as only detect in certain zones. If you have an Amazon Echo display, you can even stream it on your display as well. Another drawback though is that you can't do any Alexa routines with it though :( So that's a bummer. Other than that, does exactly what you expect on a security camera.",4,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"I was very excited to get my hands on one of these cameras and I got what was expected.  The camera is good quality, not great, it definitely has room for improvement but then again it is a $20 camera.  The audio is kind of William Hung and definitely not Vince Neil.  The night vision is ok, but I cannot see my puppets across their room in the dark, given it is like 16 feet.  The camera itself is cool, I like the magnetic base and you can flip the picture 180° in the app.  So mounting is simple and very clean.As for placement options, don't mount the camera outside, unless you like magic smoke.  The kit comes with a metal plate that you can put on the wall so it is virtually mountable anywhere you are willing to put a screw.  The power cord is long enough but a battery option would be nice.  The wifi is good as long as you have good broadcast, ideally a mesh network.",4,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0
"These are great little cameras...especially at this price.  Knocked off a star because they dropped person detection.  I want notifications when a person is detected, not every time a car passes, a bird flies by, a tree sways in the wind.

Notifications are nice, and it's possible to limit the motion detection in the field of view.  I have one camera watching out the front window.  It's not an outdoor camera.  I was going to purchase a second one until I discovered they have a slightly more expensive model that pans.  That is now overlooking our great room.  For the price its hard to beat.

"Not bad for a tiny camera. You can install a micro mini card for up to 32g and the motion detection will going to start recording when it detects any motion or sound. Picture quality was not the best, but for a tiny compact cam its unbeatable.  Almost remind me of the gopro video quality on day time recording. Night mode is not bad. Theres 4 infrared lights installed around the cam that is good enough for close range view for night time recording. I think they should've installed 6 infrared that would've add the brightness of night vision recording. I notice that sometimes it will record and it will make it look like theres a motion getting detected when there was no movement. Other than that was great to add an extra set of eyes.",4,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0

Received multiple error 90 codes and network name not found.  The reason they were bought was because of the price point.  I’m stuck with two cameras that don’t work at all.

I really love the concept of this camera. It's a security camera with no subscription. I feel that wyze is missing the big picture. We want a camera for outdoors to be able to track people coming in and out and see intruders. Most people are using this camera and facing it out their windows and yet it's not even weather resistant. Yes it's a indoor camera but wyze we know who's in our house. The quality of the camera picture is not great the tracking is really spot on and can track at a somewhat lengthy distance. You wont be able to see too much detail on people's face unless the camera is near your wifi router and you're not making too much movement. I would say sure if you're on a budget like me get it and you can scare off people from coming into your yard but if you want to catch folks it wont do the job. I wish wyze can increase video quality 1080p but the picture is grainy as ever the further away you are from your wifi and I have very good wifi. Good concept needs better performance and an outdoor camera would be nice.,4,1,2019-6-4,1,0,0
"I am very impressed with this Wyze security camera. Install was fairly easy and everything was up and running great for a few months. After, I received an update and the camera stopped working because of an error while trying to connect to the wifi. However, I read the instructions on how to fix connectivity issues and used my phone to forget the wifi network and then reconnect, and vuala the cam is back up! The only recommendation would be to record for longer periods of time when the camera detects movement. The 12 second clips start recording a bit late and finish recording a bit early. Other than that everything is superb! I really appreciate this camera and the price is unbeatable for peace of mind. Thanks for a quality product and great support Wyze!",5,1,2019-3-30,1,0,0
"I don't think they allow enough room for me to properly rate this dream of a smart camera.  I love electronics,gadgets and tech and purchase and use a wide range of different Items. this Smart Camera gets my eye buldging and smoking ears award.

I use them for home security the wide view is amazing for a smart camera of this price range. I can pinch and zoom and see the color of the persons eyes that's at my front gate some 60 ft away from my door cam.  its sensitivity will catch a fly buzzing past to just a person moving about and if you set it for detecting a person it does it with an occasional false alert.

The WYZE cam is easy to install and set up even for a layman, has video quality expected from a much more expensive smart camera. the motion detection sensitivity is for this price range SPOT ON and it don't  require a hub or cloud storage with it tf card slot. I helped a friend research and purchase a home security system and he went with Blink although easy to set up it has to have a hub its sensitivity I have found to be a little excessive and not easily set to not alert constantly and is almost 5 times the price. Pair the WYZE with available door and window sensors and you can leave home knowing that your home is being watched and you will get your alerts even 700 mile's away. look for my review videos coming soon from Thecrazydeveloper",5,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0
"does most of the things other security cameras do for much less money.  really good to check in on your house, car, cat.  if you want something that will call the police for you, this is not it.  it will alert you on motion or alarm.  also, you can use it to talk to the guy who just broke in.  other features and video quality are similar to products costing much more.  Turn off the night vision if aimed through a window.  my only real gripe is that it does not easily connect to a pc, just an app.  The app is fine for looking in when you are out.  However, I would really like to be able to record to a pc hard drive.  Also, monitoring from a desktop would be useful to me.  Otherwise, the cameras work great for me.  No need to spend more on something from netgear.",5,1,2019-5-3,1,0,0
"This little camera is amazing. I can zoom in and see a perfectly clear image and there's also a 2-way mic/speaker so you can yell at your kids caught in the act of smashing glass bottles all over the driveway. The lag from the kids smashing the first bottle and my phone alerting me for motion detection, was a total of 1 bottle. So I can thank this awesome little camera for only 2 of the 6 glass bottles available for smashing. I have purchased a 2nd camera and have plans to buy new products from wyze to try them all out.",5,1,2019-7-21,1,1,0
"After multiple emails, 4 calls and an error submission through the app I was never able to receive support for the connectivity issue. I read 17 blog reviews including the 'community' site for Wyze Labs with no solution.  The camera hardware is slick but without network connectivity they are useless bricks.  Before you consider buying these know that I am a network engineer and I tried every conceivable solution only to realize the app is severely flawed in the December app update.  I have a Samsung Note 9 and I'm running a fiber at the location of the cameras. There's only so much I'm willing to dig into for a $20 camera. Amazon can have them back.",1,1,2019-2-16,1,1,0
"Tried to  like it. Hardware is nice and easy to connect. But the software is horrible. It constantly freezes and becomes unresponsive. Our internet speed is more than enough, phone has 4G ram. Cell connection strong. Software just keeps lagging and hanging up. I was going to replace my DLink cameras with these but it's not worth it.Ok update. After checking everything I could I found a setting in the greeting screen. It's in the account area under app settings. Pick camera and then enable hardware decoding. Why this setting is not on by default is beyond me. It's also in an area I would not expect to find it. So the camera now works great and will definitely buy anther two",5,1,2019-1-19,1,1,0
"I got this device on Sunday and after setting up for the first time, it worked very great. However next day, the device began to have connection issue. I went to live stream on my phone and said it is an error 90, meaning there is an internet connection problem. I followed the instruction on their web page by power cycling (unplug the cord, wait for 30 seconds, and plug it back in) and resetting the device. Still nothing worked. I tried multiple times and nothing changed. I do not understand why it doesn't work since I used the 2.4 network for this device as it stated I should.This product is a WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!",1,1,2020-1-6,1,1,0
"I wasn't sure how I felt about this camera while I was setting the app up. It was a little annoying and laggy. Got it all connected right and it's been great!! Quality picture, good sound quality and I could discreetly place it in my front window without mounting it or anything. Love how you can adjust the height of it! The app is actually great too and connects a lot faster than my other cameras do. Can't beat the price...I will buy more in the future!",5,1,2020-9-4,1,1,0
I absolutely love this camera for the price. The video quality is amazing. It seems to work outdoors as well without damaging the camera. The only issue I found with outdoor use is that I definitely need a better mounting system for it. The motion detection is really sensitive. The only thing I would change is how long the “event” videos are. Sometimes it will see someone pull up to my house but not get out of the car and come upTo my house which is definitely a downfall.,4,1,2019-5-25,1,1,0
"The price of this device will entice you.  But you should know that you are getting what you pay for.The Good:  The device is sturdy, and it does give decent picture quality.  Night vision from behind a window is better than most camera's ive seen, but you still cant really ""see"" anything. There are a number of ways to customize the functions of the camera- but that's where the good stops.",2,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0
"I can’t say enough positive things about this camera. My hubby jokes I should be paid to promote this camera the way I talk about it. We had an expensive camera, the Lenovo, to watch over our first born babygirl. She never slept in our room- it wasn’t our style. So I would sleep with the monitor right next to my face. It was a bright blue light right in my face, even when it was in night mode. I couldn’t move it more than a foot from the crib or the quality diminished. Then when the sun would rise, the camera would just go black and couldn’t balance night to day mode well. The volume was finicky. Sometimes it would randomly lose connection in the middle of the night and I’d have to get up and go unplug and replug it in to regain connection. A NIGHTMARE. And we kept this thing for 4 friggin months.So then I’m in hope Depot one day, and this little camera is on sale for $25. So I figure I’d try it out. ITS AMAZING.",5,1,2019-6-20,1,0,0
"I bought this system to monitor my 2 Dogs, while I'm away from home  It has exceeded my expectations.  It took about 5 minutes to get it hooked up and ready to go.  I am so not a tec' person, so if I can do it, ANYBODY can.  It's that easy to set up.  It sends you a notification to your phone every time (this feature can be turned off) it detects sound or movement.  I can talk to my dogs and let them know that I see them.  It has reduced their bothering of stuff they shouldn't be touching.  They hear me loud and clear.  It has a really nice range of view and the live picture is crystal clear.  The voice is clear but there's a little distorted noise in the back ground.  I added a 64 gb micro-SD card to record and save my videos.  I love this little video cam.  It is so worth more then the low price tag.  I highly recommend it.",5,1,2019-2-21,1,0,0
"My husband and I lost everything we owned in an apartment fire earlier this year. We received our first Wyze cam as a housewarming gift due to its smoke detector alert feature. We loved it so much that we bought another! We took a vacation to Ireland last month and it made it much easier to be away from home because we could check in on our cat any time we wanted.Pros: Night vision, easy set up, adjustable motion detection sensitivity, picture quality",5,1,2018-7-26,1,2,0
"Extremely happy with this camera! Installed it yesterday with no problems. I saw in reviews how ppl had problems with it detecting and alerting you which I was having problems with that as well but I did mess with the settings and figured it out. Easy peasy. Bought a 64GB SD card so it records continuously which is so worth it. The picture is VERY clear and night mode is very clear as well. The only downfall about this, is it made me realize how much my dog waits at the door for my boyfriend and I to come home which was painful to see while I was at work lol. Anyways, bought a second one today for the other part of our house. Def will recommend this to anyone, especially for the price!",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"This is a tiny little cube that does not rotate but provides a way to talk through your phone to your child or someone at the other end of your camera. I got it for my bedroom since I am gone 4 mos. a year - or anytime I'm not home. Luckily, I have a rotating camera in my living area which is nice because I can sweep over the whole thing and see what's going on. This little Wyze camera is perfect for a bedroom or nursery. It has a night-vision mode that turns your view to B&W. I mounted it near my windows. I uploaded two photos of what I see to this review. Worth the price! Easy set-up once I figure out that I had to pull out the stand from the bottom of the camera; then I could see the ""button"" to turn it on!",5,1,2018-12-7,1,1,1
"Both of my sons purchased these cameras and suggested I do as well.  I paid less than $25 dollars for the camera which transmits wirelessly to my iphone via the  Wyze Cam app which I downloaded for free.  Installation took 10 minutes thanks to the youtube video that was recommended in the set up instructions. I wanted this to connect directly to an outlet so I also ordered the outlet adapter which cost around $9. The picture is clear. Because my wireless can be iffy, I chose sd rather than hd but as you can see the picture is clear.  You can zoom in as you would any image on your phone, for example to see if you remembered to lock your deadbolt.  I don't think I've figured out the motion detection feature yet so I gave it an average rating.  I recommend this camera as it does what it says.",5,1,2019-7-16,1,0,1
"There is nothing else that comes close to this for the price. I’ve used a number of different security cameras in the past. The video quality and features of this are much better than the others I’ve tried and the setup is about as easy as it gets. They are continually adding new features through updates to both the app and the camera’s firmware. The only thing missing that I’d like to see is the ability to view the video using a web browser, but that might be difficult because of the high level of security they use. I also appreciate that there is no subscription required. Even though this is an indoor camera I have one of mine mounted outside under the eaves of my house where it is protected from the weather. It has worked flawlessly there for nearly a year.",5,1,2019-2-16,1,0,0
"I was super excited about this camera for the first week and a half I had it. I got it to keep an eye on my anxious dog so I didn’t really need anything too crazy. First week everything was great, I could check up on him and make sure he wasn’t acting up in his crate. After a week the camera now takes forever to connect on the app and then it only shows the livestream for 2-3 seconds before it totally freezes. I have removed and reconnected the device, I have deleted and redownloaded the app. I can even restart the camera from the app but it never does anything. The removing of the camera and then adding it back from scratch worked for a couple hours. I also have the SD card which I completely cleared and I don’t have it saving any of the recordings so I’m not sure what the problem is. I was excited and now I’m just disappointed.",1,1,2020-7-10,1,1,0
"I was skeptical that this would be any good, with such a reasonable price, but bought one to set up to monitor my dogs while we are out of the house. I was amazed at the quality, and the sound and motion activation is great. Its so sensitive that at full sensitivity rating, it caught reflections from cars driving by! So we had to fiddle with settings a bit till we got it just right, and it sends a notification if the dogs are barking or moving around in their crates a lot, which lets me know I need to come home and let them out a little earlier than usual. I was so impressed we bought two more and set them up to watch the house while we were on vacation. Great price, and good quality for that price.",5,1,2019-5-31,1,0,0
"Ahh! Why didn’t I think of this sooner! I trapped a feral kitten and he’s in the adjacent part of our house in the bathroom but I only know how he’s doing by checking in on him in person...and he’s terrified of humans still! I thought of getting a baby monitor and those are spendy! Then this popped up in my suggestions, and I purchased it! I literally have it taped to a door but it’s PERFECT! I can check in on him at any time to see what he’s doing and I can talk to him, and hear him if he’s meowing! (I actually had never heard him make one noise until I got this WYZE camera!) Hoping it will make his transition smoother and I can get him adopted out to a loving home!",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,1
"I have other cams around the house and got these as additional ones as my other cams are expensive. This one just put them to shame in connectivity, speed, almost every area.For the price this is hands down the best cam in the world!",5,1,2019-7-11,1,0,0
"Great picture quality, easy to set up, great night vision, great sound quality. Don't like that the cord is so short or that it only comes with one adhesive pad incase you mess up with the first one. Don't like that it doesn't have a cloud storage to access remotely. Basically can't be used outdoor because if someone destroys it or steals it with the memory card then you can no longer access any recorded footage.",4,1,2019-10-7,1,1,0
"Bought 2 cameras and wyze SD cards as well after reading the good reviews here. There very reason I got this device with the SD card is for the continuous recording feature, but unfortunately it doesn't work. The real time video is good so I'll give them 2 stars for that. I saw their YouTube videos and did the set up. But the continuous recording feature doesn't save anything to the SD card. Everytime I view the playback, it says no video for the time range. Also, the time lapse feature saves the 'video' in albums, but when you click on it it says failed to download. It has so many issues. There is a manual record button which was the only thing that worked but that saves the video to my phone, not the SD card. So the whole point is lost. I was hoping this would be a good buy but unfortunately it isn't. Returning both the cameras.",2,1,2020-3-16,1,0,0
"The camera no longer performs offline continuous recording reliably, if at all. When I ran into the problem, I researched various forums and learned that the latest update appears to have reinforced the necessity of keeping the camera connected to the internet. I bought the camera knowing that it previously did allow offline continuous recording.",1,1,2019-10-19,1,2,0
"I have 5 of these cameras. They have developed a seriously reliability problem that is really annoying. Every time we leave the house for any extended period of time and I try to view the camera remotely (I rarely look at them while we are home), at least 2 of the cameras fail to connect. Force stopping the Wyze app and doing a restart does not fix the issue (as suggested by the Wyze app). Once we return home and unplug the camera for 5 or more minutes then plug it back in usually gets the camera back online. I currently have one of the 5 cameras that will not come back online no matter what  i do.All the cameras have up to date firmware and are less than 40 foot from the wireless router.",1,1,2018-1-29,1,2,0
"I tried to cameras before this, they sucked. This camera was half the price of both of those and for the price it is well worth it. The small size makes it easy to put in awkward angles along with its adjustable  Spring Base. The delay is minimal compared to the others I’ve tried but still a little bit. The speaker is much much louder than the other ones when trying to speak to pets. That is useful. I haven’t tried the night vision yet and I do not have an SD card in it yet. I am very satisfied so far though for the price definitely.",4,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0
As I take care of a feral cat society the use of a cam is essential for me.  I have to say that I am not disappointed in the quality of the video or the playback of this cam.  I like the option of time lapse too so that I can i a few moments see how many animals come to visit at night.  The IR and night vision is superb quality and the customer service team is very helpful and patient with someone like me who is not adept at technology.  Motion detection is spot on and you can adjust the sensitivities and be alerted of movement or sound.  I intend to purchase more of their cams as well as their other products to compliment the V2 that I already have.,5,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"Not much of a reviewer but I feel the need to chime in on this one. I have 2 of these cameras I bought directly from the Wyze  they are not my favorite cameras in the world but for the price I paid, $19.99 they do a decent job and after 2 years are still working. However that being said, I needed another camera quickly and didn’t want to spend a lot so I ordered one from Amazon, that camera is already in the trash. It lasted about 24 hours, not sure what the difference is but it got really hot & then just died. Since I already owned 2 Wyze cams and was confident it would do the job I threw the packaging away once opened and of course it was trash pick up day so I couldn’t return it. So it’s disappointing to say the least since I didn’t have the camera I needed and out $23 & some change. But I guess I should be glad it didn’t catch my house on fire because it was really HOT!  My 1 star review is for the camera I got from Amazon, would obviously give it a zero if I could. However with my original 2 Wyze cams my biggest pet peeve is they tend to go offline a lot which doesn’t help when I need to see. The pic is good, don’t use the voice much so can’t really comment on that, they would be better if you could move the camera like some others. So if I decide to get another one, not sure I will because now I’m concerned about it being a fire hazard,  I will order straight from the company next time.",1,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"Picks up motion, sound and people and lets you know which with alerts.  Picture quality is good day or night if there is plenty of light.  Zooming in gets grainy.  Indoor use only right now.  Need to have an available outlet in the area you'd like to place the camera.  If placing facing out a window have to play around to avoid glare or refledtive image of the camera.  Wires can be unsighly if you can't avoid placing discretely but all in all I'm happy I purchased them.  Super quick set up and served the need right away without costing a fortune.  No monthly fee for 2 weeks of cloud storage is a plus and features compare well to higher cost brands out there.  I would recommend if you need cameras right away without a large out of pocket cost.",4,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"I love the clean quirky look of this camera. Not super crazy about the mounting system although I like that the base is magnetic. I'm unable to find a decent angle to use these through my windows because they don't work well with a 90 degree angle. Otherwise, the picture quality is pretty good, they accept an SD card and the connection time is great. The same can be said about their customer support. I emailed them about a whirring sound in the background when I try to listen in to my apartment. Within a day they responded to let me know they're aware of the problem and should have a fix in March. I'm so fed up my my five Zmodo cameras all going offline all the time now and practically non existent customer support. The internet is full of people complaining about their Zmodo cameras showing ""Device Offline"",  I decided to leave Zmodo behind and give Wyze a chance. I ordered three more cameras and I hope to enjoy pain free monitoring of my apartment from work. When the sound issue is resolved I'll up my rating to 5 stars.",4,1,2018-3-2,1,0,0
"Terrible product.  After you finally get it set up, you'll probably be forced to download a firmware update which will probably brick the device and corrupt the SD card you had.Never have I been so infuriated after spending an hour troubleshooting only to come to the conclusion that 1) this product is absolute garbage and 2) it is not worth my time wrestling with garbage.",1,1,2020-8-12,1,1,0
"Really impressed with the quality of the picture.  We bought a cover for it so we could use it outside since they are sold out of the outdoor camera. The only complaint I have is when a bug flies in front of it, it sets off a motion notification to my phone. The price on these cameras is amazing. Good quality. Found out about these cameras when my daughter was watching a utube video of a father and daughter singing together. The most adorable thing ever.  The dad singing is one of the owners of wyze.",5,1,2020-8-13,1,1,0
"This delivery is my 3rd a d 4th Wyze Cams. They can be a little tricky working with Alexa sometimes but they are easy to install and set. They are well built and have amazing picture quality, both day and night.  You get all the features and quality of high end, high price cameras at 10-20% of the cost AND your not paying a monthly fee for service. Wyze Labs has, so far anyways, been very customer friendly. They listen to what their customers have to say, for the most part anyways, myself and several others have been requesting a doorbell camera and to my knowledge they haven't committed to making one as of yet. If they ever do though and it is up to par with their other cameras, 'Ring' and the other big shot's are certainly going to take a hit.",5,1,2019-2-28,1,0,0
"Okay, so I just got these October 22th 2019 and I have to admit I was super skeptical over the price ,cuz since the day I left my cradle my dad always told me "" you get what you pay for"" it's almost been about a week and I have to say I'm incredibly shocked, the picture, motion sensor, the setup is crazy super easy, a monkey can do it with his eyes closed. Overall as of right now I'm completely shocked on how well they're working, but only time will tell how well they're going to perform. I will definitely update in the future on durability, and quality.FYI, you have to have Wi-Fi for these to work.",5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0

"This camera has some terrific features and ease of use. I like it's ability to record and review footage. The area where it fails bigtime is that the app is unreliable. Most of the time trying to connect to this camera via the app on my Samsung Galaxy S9 doesn't work and I'll have to struggle between restarting my phone, power cycling the camera, etc. This happens all too frequently to the point where just wanting to see what happened at a given time turns into a half hour project of trying to get the camera software to talk with my phone. Kind of defeats the purpose if it is this unreliable.",2,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
It does not record everything especially if it picks up motion and stops its 15 second record in quick concession the second movement won't pick up it's like it shuts off motion sensor for a certain amount of time after it records something.

"I have tried several of the top brands and still have them but dollar for dollar Wyze cameras both of them are for me. far superior then Arlo or Logi Circle & Circle Two as well as D-Link and these are just from 2018-present.  Don't get me wrong as they all have their merits.  But as the headline says....  The vids I have watched will definitely make you want to own these two and from someone who is a huge pain in the #$% when it comes to tech.  Trust me when I say I never put my name on anything.

"These cameras cannot be beat for the price, period. The features and reliability cannot be oversold. I have two of them outside in third-party housings, through the 'rainy' season and still going strong! I have no complaints, just be strategic choosing your mounting spots and your cameras should give you plenty of return on your investment. It should be noted that the camera under the eave is mounted on the side of our house that most storms come from. For that reason I cut a piece of plastic to fit the housing so that it covers the lens and mic ports inside the housing. The other cam is mounted near the front door and is shielded from all but the most extreme weather conditions.",5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,1
The size of this cam is really quite impressive. It’s small enough to fit inside the cabinet of my 3d printer which allows me to monitor the progress of the printing process.

Idk what happened but then it all came together and started working fine. I'm afraid to touch it now...definitely won't unplug it unless I absolutely have to. Seems like there are lots of little issues that could and do arise. However since then the camera has worked very well. I do wish it recorded longer than 12 seconds when motion is detected. I'm using it for my cats...long story but one is being a jerk.  Anyways, for 25 bucks I would take the chance and get this camera. Maybe you cant get it to work? Just return it.

"This camera is great. The only exception is the night vision. I love in a condo and outside of my window is a light. Because of this light the night vision doesn’t really work. On the back of my condo I try to use the camera through the window. The reflection makes it impossible to use at night. That said, I know both of these issues are both told to me ahead of time and self-created. I’ve preordered exterior cameras because I love the product so much and want to be able to use the cameras outside. Once they are installed I suppose I will use the other 2 cameras to watch my cat?

Picture quality was good but the camera wouldNot stay connected to my WiFi network and “motion sensor” and or notifications was a joke! It simply just did not work. 1) i had to try to set it up 3x because it didn’t want to accept my WiFi info so I tried manually a few times and it still didn’t work. Then magically it connected to the wife 2) the app that the camera works with is trash. It takes forever to load and isn’t helpful at all since it takes like 2 minutes to start up each time you try to open it. 3) I tried to test out the motion sensor/ alert notification function And it failed every time. 4) the shape of it made it Hard to place it in a discreet place and to secure it to a surface/ without compromising line of site ( also you can rotate the picture which makes it very challenging) 5) I read a bunch of reviews about the camera bouncing random IP addresses. Meaning that it sends the camera info/picture to random IP addresses.THIS IS A MAJOR SECURITY ISSUE. Who knows who’s watching your camera? Creepy.,1,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"Fantastic cameras with lots of features (working feature and no monthly fees).  I have had a handful of cameras over the past few years and these especially for the price are the clear winner.  Big problem with other cameras are the motion detection, well this has that also and works great too but they have added human detection option, to where you are only notified of human detection, which not only works nicely it clears your notifications of all those false alerts.  You can still view normal detections in the app but only notifies you if its a human detection (based on how you set it up).  Highly recommended!",5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"Can't believe this costs less than 30 bucks. And, don't confuse that price with quality. This indoor smart home camera has all the features that you would typically find in expensive ones from motion detection to night vision, you name it. One of the coolest feature is that it has local storage option, so you can buy a micro-sd card and it will do the rest. No more paying monthly subscription. All your data is saved locally, so you don't have to concern about your privacy either. Setting up with the WYZE mobile app was very easy. I set up mine in less than 5 minutes.

"the only reason I purchased this was because my car was stolen. Thankfully I got it back, but this time I was ready to catch some thieves! It’s super convenient and easy to install. You need to download the app on the phone( I have Apple) I had this camera for  10 months and I loved it so much that I bought a second one to put in my front door. It has motion detectors (you can set up the parameters for motion tagging), sound is okay. You can listen and you can respond back thru the camera( I actually scared my sister once lol ) and the night vision is decent. My complex has outdoor lighting, so that helps out a lot! The app will give you notifications if there’s a motion or sound happening. I also bought the SD card for continuous recording. I think it’s worth it.

"I was very skeptical about the camera features and the expected performance.  I'm a current user of a higher end product ( Nest) and i decided to give this one a try.It performs up to par with the more expensive ones. Performance is great , just make sure you buy the good speed micro SD card along with it and make sure you have enough memory and read/write speed ( don't buy the cheap memory) .  I went with 64 and it is enough  for my needs but all is working very well.  There are external mounts from a 3rd party vendor that allows you to mount externally so you can cover anything you might want to protect.",5,1,2019-8-6,1,0,0
"Setup was easy enough, but the quality was terrible. Motion detection was hit or miss - I would walk past a few times and it might catch the last time - might. Very grainy. Bought an Amazon Cloud Cam and it was much better out of the box. I don’t want to have to mess around with 10 different settings like some of the reviews here recommended. I just want it to work. Not impressed.",1,1,2019-12-12,1,1,0
"I'd give this a 3.5 star if I could. This camera is a relatively good buy. The two way audio is pretty poor. You can hear them though your phone OKAY, but your voice coming out is very poor. The camera aspect is fair. I had this setup in my living room and the quality was tough to make out specific faces. I can't say I'd recommend for security purposes as I used to review security footage for my previous job and these aren't very adequate, unless the people are close up. IE if you put this in the window next to your front door. The motion and audio detection works well to alert you and the free online recordings are nice. I tried a 4GB SD card (without formatting which may have cause my problem) and it wouldnt recognize an SD card was inserted. Overall, the quality is decent, and for the price, you do get alot. I would recommend buying depending on your purpose.",3,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0

"Dang, this is pretty cool! So I had a network cable going to my front porch from old system. I got a poe injector and a female micro usb to female usb extension cable to make this work. The reason for the extension cable is that the input into the camera requires the micro usb you use to be smaller than the one that cane with my Poe kit. Any setup you come up with that will provide usb power should work.The camera itself is so cool. I mounted it on the glass for my porch light and can see everything. Appear to have all the footage I need for free. My only complaint is that it can take 1-3 seconds to connect to camera, so you can’t respond immediately but it’s still very cool. How do they provide all this for so cheap? It seems similar to a $200 nest cam, and that has a $5 a month subscription fee.",5,1,2018-12-22,1,0,0

"This little camera is a decent bargain. You’ll get a good live view of the area it’s looking at and alerts on movement that I’d estimate are false positives about 30% of the time.I use the SD card expansion to record activity too. It is OK, however I have found that when there is an “event” that is recorded (motion), that segment of the playback on the SD card becomes corrupt. So, I can see the 5 second preview the system records, but if I want to go back to watch more to see what happened, I can’t. This makes the camera somewhat useless for investigating any activity after the fact.",2,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0

The CEO used the same MEANINGLESS phrase when he apologized for the recent data breach.  The old review follows: How can Amazon recommend this crap?

If you’re purchasing this camera to do something important with spend a little extra money and get a higher quality camera . I’ve owned a dozen  different types of wifi cameras thought I love this little guy but what happened makes me not ever want to buy one again basically the recording stopped working on all three cameras after recent update and I lost valuable information. I reached out to technical support submitted a ticket They never bothered to follow up.  I got one email saying they’re working on the issue and then no more responses .  Doesn’t matter how inexpensive this camera is if it doesn’t do it it says it’s going to do I wouldn’t buy it I’m planning on returning all three of mine. good luck with your purchase.

"2 days after my ability to return the camera expired, I was sent a firmware update.  This wiped the card and no the camera no longer works. It will not detect the SD card and will only record 12 second events. This camera seemed decent but is a fail and customer service is non-existent.  They never reply.  To shoot through glass I had to purchase an IR illuminator ($25) and turn off the internal IR lights.  That's fine, but I was given no warning that the card would be wiped, and I had no idea that in doing so, the camera would brick. Save your money and buy something a little better.

I decided to use a longer cord to sit the camera at a different angle and gain more of the room in the picture and when I did so I was never able to connect to my server again. I switched back to the old power cord and after  attempts it connected then my phone read something to the effect that I had to power up the camera and the light was on.

"This is a very nice, not expensive, high tech toy. Good quality overall but it's a toy. I have 2 of them working in continuous recording mode, set not far from wireless router and at least 1 out of 3 times I try to connect to any of them it fails to connect. But another camera might work at the same time, so it's not wifi failure. On the other hand, even if a camera shows in the app that it's offline (why it's offline when the other one is online?) I still can tap on it and it actually might connect and show live stream. So, I never know will I be able to connect or not. My biggest problem is connection reliability and I cannot recommend it as a ""security camera"" (I don't think Wyze uses this term, so everything is fair). It probably does not deserve 4 starts but if you think of it as a toy then it does.",4,1,2019-12-27,1,1,0
"They continue to update features which is great. The new person recognition function will be great once they work out some issues. The camera still picks up plants and shadows as “people”. The night vision mode is great, but if you have this going through glass with a porch light on, even 10 feet away, there is too much glare for that function to work. The notifications get sent to my phone and apple watch with a thumbnail of the event which is awesome. The app does seem to have preferences on the quality of connection. I cannot use the app on my work’s wifi as it is too slow, I have to disconnect and use my wireless service to view any video.",5,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0
"So this camera does everything the way more expensive cameras do, but at 1/4 the cost.  They are building an ecosystem, and it is good.  I know they are constantly iterating but the one thing they need, is to add a battery to these.  Just a small one in case the power goes out.  My Router and modem are on a ups, but I cant put a UPS everywhere I might want to put one of these.  Night vision isnt great, and unless you put an SD card in them the recovery time after a recording is horrendous.  They say its 5 minutes, but in reality its more like 10.  However long it takes to upload the video to the server basically.  If you have an sd card it caches them there, then uploads so no recovery time.",4,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
"Surprising value and quality. You will really be hard pressed to find a better value out there. Video quality is good, and the app works smoothly. My only complaint is that you only get a 12 second recording for each event.  Would it kill you guys to bump that up to 30 seconds? Or 45 seconds? I mean, come on, storage is super cheap these days. From what I can tell, they retain recordings for like 2 weeks. Why not lower that to 1 week of recordings and give us 30 seconds recordings per event?As a point of comparison, something like the Arlo Q is the better device. Better video quality, and a great app. But, at 6 times the cost, many people will opt for Wyze. And I cannot fault them for it. WyzeCam is great!",4,1,2018-1-9,1,2,0

So I broke down and got the official Wyze card, which came yesterday; put that in and it only recognizes 1.86GB of the 32GB card.Also concerned that you apparently cannot turn off the internet connection, but I got around that by blocking it from my router using the routers app (Netgear with Nighthawk app for those wondering).",2,1,2019-2-12,1,1,0

This is where the issues started kept getting unable to connect wifi message over and over. I called customer service and they make you download app to check your WIFI. Didnt work and then gave me allll these technical reason why its Not connect. To the average person it means nothing !

The set up process was a bit clunky, IMHO, but I got through it and these seemed to work fine. For about four days. Then suddenly one evening they just stopped working. Nothing had changed with my WiFi and it was working fine. These just wouldn't connect any more. I tried a reboot, I tried unplugging them and a bunch of other recommended fixes from their web site and message boards. From what I've seen on the internet, this appears to be a common problem.

I use them to help monitor my elderly parents who live with me because I can't be there 24/7.I have tried other cameras, but they all seem to make you store your videos on a remote server (usually in China) and then they start making you pay for storage. These cameras allow you to store your own video on your own SD card. Or you can just view the live feed and not store anything. (My other cameras don't function at all unless I keep paying a monthly fee.) You can also view what's happening at any moment from your phone and speak to the person on the other end through the camera if you want.

I have not attempted any fixes for it because there is a little light in the neighborhood  (little light) and having it in normal 1080 its still a great image. All in all, if you want a security camera and  one that delivers an amazing quality and provides the 2 week rolling storage, this is my recommendation.

Camera requires an internet connection. You can not access the camera with the app just on your internal WiFi. You get adds when setting the device up as well.

I have 9 of these now...LOVE THEM! They have consistently added options to the app and show a genuine interest in the satisfaction of customers.  They even put out a firmware to allow you to use the cams with other camera software (most companies lock you into their app/software). I get notifications fairly quickly and I have had no issues with motion recordings or playback using 32gb samsung sd cards. Anyone complaining about sensitivity needs to adjust the motion detection boxes and sensitivity slider and it works great!The only thing I'd add is multiple motion detection areas...right now we are limited to 1 box..I'd like the ability to highlight boxes in a grid for motion detection.,5,1,2019-6-5,1,0,0

I bought this instead of getting a doorbell camera. I have a window right next to the front door that I can face towards the outside. It does have a slight glare from the window.

Like these inexpensive cameras. Adding a memory chip made them even better for my use. Took a minute to figure how to set them up but once I understood it really was not that bad. Gives notification to your phone for motion or sound detection. You can listen or talk to intruders. Good for a family member to just see that you got home safely. I gave access to a family member and once they could not call me because the sound on my phone was left off so the yelled at me over the camera and i called them.

Just now I checked on all three and they came up perfect. Few minutes later, nothing. Cannot connect. The price is certainly right. Certainly worth the money, but undependable. Might be my wifi connection, not sure. But they are just not the Amazon cloud cam. I'm probably spoiled. Oh, and the range is about 2/3 of the ACC. That's my experience.

If you want to record videos and get movement snippets and alerts you have to add a micro SIM card, well the problem is getting the camera to recognize such SIM card. I added a SIM and it worked for a short time and then the camera stopped recognizing the SIM card hence recording video in movement. I recently discovered that sound is horrible: it has an echo when you speak thru the app besides its own created background noise.

"I played with this in the home and I liked the 1080 picture quality.  But I needed to get a better camera for outside.  I am currently using two Wyze Cam's one for my front yard and one for my porch.  I have both without any outside added enclosure but it is up under my awning so no rain on it.  I have been using for over 6 months and now it is winter.  So far it has worked great in the cold  -9 F and it going down to -15F tonight.  I will update to let you know how they work at that temperature.  the rated spec for these cams is +32F to +104F.  It is nice that Electronics are not affected by Wind Chill,  as it will hit -45 F (Wind Chill)  In the Summer I was worried about High Humidity being not rated for outdoors as my awning will not help that and we had some very humid days and lower temps in the morning where the humidity was well over 90% and still worked flawlessly.

It works great overall, easy to use, and is collasable to it can fit on a window sill in its box form.  The only thing I do not like about it is the night vision does not work through glass and the motion detection is not instant notification as the Arlo was.  Besides that, this is the best camera considering that Arlo cameras cost about 6x the cost of this one.  Get this if you just want a camera for your door to know who is coming in, at, or around it.",5,1,2019-8-9,1,0,0
"You can’t beat this camera for the money. We have one in our dining room to monitor the house entrance and our pups when we are away. We also have some spendy Blink cameras, but the quality on this one is superior. I am aware that any monitoring device I connect to the internet (including my Alexa Spots) could have video intercepted if there were a breach or even curious employees - so I don’t install them anywhere people will be unclothed or doing anything else. I want privacy but I also want the peace of mind that comes with an alert when nothing should be alerting. I have never had an issue with it alerting me when it was “off” but know that it is always “on”. If you can live with this - and I can in this limited application - this is a steal!",5,1,2019-4-27,1,0,0
App works pretty well.  I've got a few Yi cameras as well and bought this as a test to see if it was any better.  I wish I would have just gotten these instead of the Yi's.  So far the app has had no issues unlike the Yi cameras that will always stop sending alerts every 3 to 4 months.  Then they have to work on an update for about a month and finally starts working again.  Wyze has not had this issue at all.  Only downside is I cannot view them from my PC.  Has to be through the app.  But they are adding a lot more functionality to the app.  Plus their creating additional security products that work with the cameras like motion detectors and door sensors.  Very handy.  Good little camera.,5,1,2019-5-2,1,0,0
"I have purchased several of these cameras for multiple homes. The price seems unbeatable for the quality and features this camera offers. There are some disadvantages that I point out below, but to me, these are outweighed by the low price and free cloud storage.First, as some reviewers have pointed out, it only seems to capture about 12 seconds of video to the cloud when motion/sound is detected. However, you can insert a memory card for continuous recording. And the cloud storage is free (which might explain the 12 seconds.)",5,1,2019-3-23,1,0,0
"Incredible.  What would have cost hundreds of dollars in equipment and monthly fees is available now for $25?  Plus, ability to view and control the camera from anywhere via cell phone.  Setup -- amazingly simple and straightforward.  Ability to record to a microSD card, night vision, etc.  The list goes on and on.  Regular software updates, too. Waiting for the ability to view via a web browser -- I'm sure that will come soon.  Highly recommend.",5,1,2018-11-13,1,2,0
"It just works! I mean that in the best of ways. I was able to quickly magnetic attach it to a rain gutter near an outdoor plug. All day long I played with settings and observed my pets. It was great fun using the speaker feature to talk to and scare the cat. Got home, pulled the SD card and looked at how sensibly the files were named. On my large screen I was able to see many more details that I had not noticed on the phone. Even had a hummingbird check it out.10 frames per second is great for surveying the yard and makes for small file size. It took less than 10 minutes to set up. More research and experimentation determined it can be run off a battery pack also. Purchased a few more, cheap enough to buy as gifts too!",5,1,2018-1-30,1,1,0
"I installed this outside on a Thursday night after i noticed someone had tampered with our screen window. The very next night, my wife and I got a notification that Wyze had detected a person. We looked on the live stream and saw a man breaking into our windows. Once we got home and the police couldn't find him, we got another notification. He returned and started breaking in again while we were in the house, and we were only aware because of the camera. Thanks to these notifications and video quality, we could inform the police and they tackled him and arrested him minutes later. Our $25 Wyze cam possibly saved us from harm from a 4-year fugitive. We couldn't have more gratitide for this camera and the person detection technology. Buy this now.",5,1,2019-10-20,1,2,1

The picture that I’ve attached is what the night vision looks like in my family room! It’s like night and day to the other camera -we should’ve just spent the money and got another Cloud Cam -during the day it’s an OK picture but nothing like the other camera I have in my living room. Not only that there are no video clips during the day when there is motion in the room,  I don’t get any notifications when there is motion in the room. So it really doesn’t have very much functionality. E-",1,1,2019-1-16,1,1,1
"One might expect sketchy quality from a $20-$25 wireless security camera. Not the case here. The set-up was simple, the mount is very usable, the picture is clear, motion and sound detection work well. Sound quality is not exceptional, but is acceptable. The free 12-second event recording works well to identify most triggers. Installing a MicroSD card allows continuous recording. Make sure you keep the event recording on, so you can easily scroll to the event to see more.  Add a third-party outdoor mount, and all you have to wire is the power cord; I did that for an outside mount with a 25' micro USB cord from Amazon.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"Initially, this product set up easily and worked well. Great picture, good motion detection and connectivity. Three days ago, it stopped working altogether. I tried everything including re-doing the setup process, but it will not connect. I invited my friend, who is and IT professional, to look at it and he said it definitely does not work. I'm really upset and disappointed, because the reviews were good for this and I really need a camera to watch my home when I'm at work. Very disappointed, and can not recommend.Giving 2 stars because, while it did work, it worked well. Sorry to have to give a bad review, but it is important to be honest.",2,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0
"Love the product. It has separate features to track motion, sound, or people. The only draw back is whenever you reset your router, the camera goes offline and you have to reinstall the camera.

"Amazing on how much this camera can do. I'll leave the details to others, but I want to comment on the challenge in understanding just where all the data goes. I have a couple Cam2's and a CamPan . If you've researched the pros/cons of video security and the variety of ways to capture and store the data, you'll know there is management time that comes with ownership.With Wyze, it's not very clear what's involved and it takes some research to figure out. Wyze could do a better job at this by sitting down with an editor that is familiar with users needing to understand the software interface. There is the live stream, alert video storage, SD storage, they say something about cloud storage and you find some videos and images in your device folders that you should clean out before it eats your available space. It is time consuming to really understand where everything lives, what is available when and for how long (especially before you reformat the camera SD about each week).",5,1,2018-12-22,1,0,0
"Out of the box the Wyze camera is nice, but lacks a lot of features more expensive cameras come with. However, it is very easy to hack this camera and add those features in. This hack even fixes security flaws and improves overall performance. Win, Win! I think I paid $25 when I bought this and after I uploaded the modified firmware it has been a set it and forget it. Super convenient to use.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"Quality is lower than other cameras on the market, but these things are only 20 bucks! For that price I would say they exceed expectations.Going in I did not expect them to compare to the quality in either construction or performance to say a Nest Cam.

I have two of these and will be buying many more to cover my whole house. Inside and out. Also have made several friends buy them as well.Love their person notifications.

"This tiny wonderful device is by far the best Cam I have ever used! Absolutely love it! The best part? Only $26 + tax. It’s magnetic and can be mounted anywhere with a metal base. No tools, screws required. I have it mounted on my apartment door which is metal. So now I can see all the activity going on day and night. I have a few other top brand Cam’s in my home which cost plenty $$$ and charge for additional features such as cloud storage, 2-way etc. Not with the Wyze cam. You are getting 2-way & 14 day cloud storage at no additional cost! I purchased my first one directly from Wyze in order to buy their mounting kit. Use the 5-foot USB extension cable included in this kit to extend the reach of the 6-foot USB cable included with the Wyze Cam, for a total cable length of 11 feet. I haven’t seen it on Amazon.

I got this to watch my two parrots when we are away over night.  The night vision was useless  the camera was 3 feet away and it was to dark to see a thing.  One bird is white and we could  kinda see her. The other bird we could not see at all. The day tine view was just okay so I guess if your looking for a picture that is poor this is the camera for you.

Update: I contacted the support team and they were very helpful! My camera works again 😁. Changed from 1 star to 5I only bought this to monitor my dog so I wasn't so worried about the subpar security but after 4 months of use it has completely stopped working.

Where do I start? These cams were recommended to me by some people in the home automation community for use with my ActionTiles. I was looking for a good camera that would allow me to view my house and my 3D printers all from the tablet I had set up.I ordered one regular and one panning camera and set them up. The set up process was incredibly easy. Just follow the wizard on your phone and in a few seconds you are done. I like super simple setups.,5,1,2019-4-2,1,0,1
"I bought the camera as a test to see for myself just how good a $25 camera could be.  I was not disappointed!  I know, it's an indoor camera, but after seeing so many people putting them outdoors with great results I gave it a try, since that's what I really wanted and Wyze doesnt yet offer one (they do have one in development per their forum).  I purchased an enclosure and a 25' USB cable here on Amazon and mounted it outside up under an eave.  It's been outside now for about a month with no issues at all.  We've had rain, freezing rain, high winds, and polar vortex temperatures during that time.  I have no issues with connectivity or power to camera like some others have mentioned.  Very satisfied a month in!!!",5,1,2019-2-4,1,0,0

There is no longer any online storage and that is the key to a camera system in that no one can steal the camera with all the evidence.

Immediately suspected the app, uninstalled, had to reboot my phone and purchase a new battery, which I think the company the should reimburse me for.

"Amazing camera, surprisingly good quality picture. The night vision is also great. The app is also incredible, easy to use and great features. I'm surprised this camera doesn't cost more for all it offers. My only complaint is the motion sensor is not PIR (heat detection) but simply looks for the image changing. This means there are MANY false triggers from bugs, leaves, wind blowing branches, and the sun going behind a cloud. But I can't complain too much, what can you expect from $20?",5,1,2019-2-14,1,1,0

It captures sound, has a two-way mic, micro SD for storage (which are pretty cheap these days), easy to set up, and blends in with the room.

"Person detection doesn't work half the time even when you are on camera. It doesn't matter what is distance between the person and camera. I have seen it fail for distance between 10 ft and 30 ft. When the person detection works, it takes more than a minute to receive notification. Motion detection detects laves swaying and tree branches motion (resulting in too many recordings and notifications). I tried the feature where you can focus on a particular rectangular area of the image, it misses some areas that I need to monitor. Tried to lower sensitivity of the motion detection, it did not help. Night vision is not good if you point the camera outdoors, everything is dark, except car head lights, etc. This camera requires a decent amount of configuration (for me it didn't work ""out of the box""). That is probably by design. Don't want to complain for a $20 camera.

I hooked the thing up with no problems whatsoever.  While away from home - I watched Lily get up on the counter, get in the sink, get on the table (bad kitty!).  I monitored her food/water dishes.  I yelled at her when she got on the table (but I won't do that again - it scared the crap out of her).  Even after I returned home, she kept gawking at the ceiling, expecting ""that voice"" to reprimand her again (LOL).  I have Alexa devices in my home, too.

"This is essentially a way for them to force you to upgrade to their program to make more money. They program the device to only record 12-15 seconds and then wait about two minutes before recording more motion, EVEN IF THERE IS CONTINUOUS MOTION! The only way to capture it all is if you acquire their service. Even with an SD card, it won't automatically record motion to the end. Simply a 12-second clip and it doesn't alert your phone for minutes afterward. As with their premium service, it is obviously capable of recording or allowing it to record but they essentially disable this function to force you to pay.If you just want short clips or to record videos (you have to have the app open to the page the entire time) and it will record whatever is occuring.

This camera will let you know almost instantly - I get a notification on my phone of a person detected within 15-20 seconds of me entering my house.

"Can't beat the quality of the video and security you get for $25. I actually bought a few of these to find critters that were getting in my garage that we couldn't catch. After getting rid of the critters I have now mounted these around the house for outside security. I bought incosure mounts for them to be mounted outside under roof edges and door jams. They work very well and I'm surprised how well the night vision is. Can't go wrong for the money. Wyze is doing a great job of making affordable cameras, smart plugs and smart light bulbs. I have all of the Wyze products and love them.",5,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"I made a HUGE mistake buying 2 cameras at the same time (a BlackFriday deal).. and I ended up throwing them in the trash as you can see in my pics.I bought 2 of these and they don't work.. when trying to pair to my 2.4Ghz internet WiFi as suggested by the company, they won't connect. ""Connection timed out""",1,1,2020-1-31,1,0,1
I have nothing but good things to say about this. I did a lot of research and watched YouTube videos comparing wyze to the nest. This came out better on all the tests and I have to say it’s one of the best things I’ve purchased for $25. You can connect it to your phone so can see the live feed 24/7. It records events such as movements and sound. It will alert you to when these things happen (you can change these settings also)  it’s so easy to Install and set up.If you are not sure whether to get this inexpensive brand I’m suggesting  you go ahead and click ‘add to cart’ now ! You won’t be disappointed.,5,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0
"Such an affordable, easy solution for my needs. I foster kittens through our local shelter, and I recently picked up a mom and her six babies. Mom's a bit fearful, so I'm trying not to disturb them too much. This camera is perfect. I love that there isn't a subscription service mandated to just be able to watch a live feed. I was concerned it wouldn't be capable with my network, but set up took all of 3 minutes and I had no issues. The app itself is easy to use. I've already recommended it to all my foster friends for their own foster rooms!",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,1
"It's hard to overstate how good this camera is for the price.  We are using it as a baby monitor and it works well with our 1st gen Amazon Echo Show.  The phone app is good as well.  I see no need to spend more money on a Nest Cam or similar.If you are an advanced user, RTSP support to non-Wyze apps requires you to flash different firmware to the camera itself.  I haven't bothered invesetigating or trying it since the default Wyze app works just fine for us.",5,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0
Can't beat the price for this camera but the streaming quality is uneven with lots of interruptions.Hopefully they will keep improving the software because this product really has potential. The price is at that magic threshold where I can put cameras in multiple places -- I have one monitoring my turtle tank and another monitoring my 3D printer.,3,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
I don't know how this security camera got four and a half stars on Amazon but it did not work at all for me. I could not get the notifications function to work I wanted it to send video clips to my phone the way my other security camera does and I called the company and they could not fix the issue two times and I had to send back the camera to Amazon it was a huge waste of time I had such high hopes for this camera but it was a complete disappointment the picture quality is great it will definitely live stream but I don't need live stream I need recordings of my door opening and closing and people walking by which I could not do whatsoever so I give this camera one star,1,1,2019-11-12,1,0,1
"Does not connect to my network. Tried with two different routers, both 2.4 GHz. Called support multiple times until I got someone to take the call. He went through troubleshooting steps with me, sent me an email to download RouteThis Helps. I followed the instructions and replied with the output code from RouteThis Helps. It’s been 4 days and 3 emails later and still no reply from Wyze.I have a friend with a few of the cams and they work for him. If they work, great. If not, support is not helpful.",1,1,2018-12-13,1,2,0
"The product seemed great and the picture was better than expected I like that it's compact. My husband and I were able to set up up with minimal frustrations... but honestly, I came here to process a refund but I'm outside the window. I am not a fan of this camera. It doesn't alert us of anything. So here we have a camera on our front door, during the holidays for security, and unless we sit there and watch it on our phones, it does nothing. We decided to just go with a Ring instead because everyone we know who has one likes it. This was a cheap alternative and it was a let down. Invest the money elsewhere is my recommendation.",2,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0

"The 5 stars is because for the price, this is a steal! I bought one to test out, we needed a “nanny cam” and this is perfect. It’s set to my WiFi, so it doesn’t matter if I’m miles away, I can check in on my kids. The app is easy to use, and I can keep the cams turned off while I’m home. We were so pleased, we bought 2 more yesterday to cover the rest of the house. We haven’t used the motion detection yet. As far as audio, you can’t really hear regular chatter, but the picture is great, with no lag. I highly recommend this for a basic nanny cam, it does everything a parent would need.",5,1,2019-11-30,1,1,0
"I checked out various indoor cams that I could use for monitoring my front door for deliveries and visitors.  I had looked at a few brands, but I just wasn't motivated enough to spend the $40+ for one.One night my wife told me about seeing something on TV about the Wyze cam and said that it was only $20.  I checked it out and it seemed to be everything I wanted and at a lower price point then the other ones.  I ordered one that night.",5,1,2019-2-14,1,0,0
"Let me start off by saying I love this camera! Its great quality and has awesome features. I purchased this to use as a baby monitor for my daughter. After having it for a month or so the sound shuts off randomly. So if my daughter begins to cry i cant hear her which is the whole point of the camera. Ive updated it and reinstalled it and i still have the issue. The app for the ipad also crashes so if you have the all open it will crash and takes a while to reboot. This is a great camera if you dont want the sound to run continuously. Ill have to spend money i dont have and try to find something else. My poor daughter was screaming this morning because the sound shut off and i didnt hear her, not sure how long she was crying :(",2,1,2018-2-11,1,2,0
"For the price it's great.  I also have a couple wansview and a few amazon cloud cameras.  Though this is certainly worth the price I prefer the wansview ptz (not sure the exact name, $35) because it turns, and this does not.  However, this is much smaller and if that's a concern, this is the camera to get.  For the price, again.  My amazon clouds cost almost 3x as much and has benefits this doesn't.  But it's hard to beat this if you simply want to connect and take a look to see what's happening.  The picture quality beats my amazon cloud cams.-I added a pic of my kitchen taken by it.  I'm trying to determine which of my pups are not quite housebroken. :)",5,1,2019-10-17,1,0,1
This is very cheaply made. Which I understand for the price it's not going to be great. The worst thing about this camera is the app never works! And it malfunctions all the time. I bought this so I could watch my dog from my phone whom normally goes everywhere including work with me. I have events about once or twice a week for a few hours that she can't go. It will literally take several attempts and several minutes to pull up the camera in the app. The app will keep saying camera disconnected or authenticating. It also has about a 45 second delay . . . . which if someone is breaking into your home and you have motion detection notifications set up . . that's a huge delay! You can't hear well through it either. I do like the fact you don't have to purchase additional things in the app and it holds a memory card so that's why I am keeping it. Just wish they improved the functioning of it or the app.,2,1,2018-12-15,1,0,0
Bought this just to play with and see how wifi cameras work. Was cheap so figured not out much if I decide not to do anything with it other then play.Works well in my limited playing. Good color picture during daylight and the nighttime pictures are good as well.,3,1,2018-2-17,1,1,0
I give this a one star because I can’t give it a zero star rating. If you want to use this as a baby monitor don’t get it. It says it is Alexa ready but that’s not true. I put the Wyze app on and it has to be asked over and over to show the camera because it’s constantly buffering. I got this to constantly monitor my daughter who has CP and seizures but it won’t constantly monitor. Two days after hooking up the camera (which was extremely hard to do) it lost total connection and won’t reconnect. Shame on Amazon for selling this item with all its complaints it’s had.,1,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"We tried the Arlo baby monitor and it was a total bust. The picture was pixelated/glitched all the time and would lose the signal frequently. We got a non-WiFi baby monitor, but I wanted a back up baby cam, so we got this Wyze camera. It is missing some features of a baby monitor (temp, background audio, lullabies, night light, etc.), but the Wyze camera is small and works incredibly well. I’ve only lost connection once or twice in 3 weeks. The picture is clear and I can double tap on my baby’s face and quickly see if they are sleeping or not. Night vision is perfect and this pairs nicely with a non-WiFi baby monitor. You can purchase a separate SD card to record or take pictures of your little one in the crib too. It was also very easy to add other users to the device so my wife can use it or a babysitter. You can also speak thru the device to the baby, which will be helpful later for our bedtime routines. I highly recommend this cam. It was easy to setup and get connected to (via app) and it was only $25. Definitely a cost efficient purchase and pairs perfectly with our baby monitor.",5,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0
"The camera works, the quality isn't the best. But the camera never turns off unless you unplug it. I laid a shirt over it by accident and turned off the camera via the app because I got home and did not need the camera to be on anymore and the next morning when I went to go turn it back on the camera was hot from having the shirt over it. It should not have been hot if it was actually off like the app said. So now every time I don't need it to be on I just unplug it, its a hassle but I can't find a suitable replacement that won't do the same.",2,1,2019-5-27,1,1,0
The more I used this product the more I find features that I love. The ability to record key events and take photos  while in playback is awesome. There was a stranger walking in our neighborhood going around banging on doors for no apparent reason. My camera is setup for continuous recording. Was able to take clips out of the playback for key sections of the playback for whatever during I needed to provide to Police if necessary. I didn't noticed these features were available until I turned my phone to the horizontal position and touched the screen to move the video footage back to the section I wanted to review. I saved the video clips and photos to my gallery. Absolutely AWESOME. Another event happened in my Aunt's neighborhood. There was a crime committed on her street. The police noticed she had security cameras. I purchased the outdoor cases via Amazon and used the 12 second event footage to get a description of the suspect in question. I have recommended these cameras to lots of family and friends and they loved them as well. Thanks Wyze. Keep up the great work with this product.,5,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
"I've been shopping for a camera to monitor a few areas and found this one perfect.  An excellent price point and no recurring fees.  This is one of the more frustrating things about some of the other companies, they always have their hand out. Here is our latest $$ priced camera system. Oh, by the way, you need to pay additional for cloud storage if you want to access those recordings.  I can't begrudge them wanting to make a profit on their item, that is the way of things these days, but if you have one of the more expensive lines out there do you really need to also ask me for a subscription when I can just as easily record locally?  Save your money and try one of these instead",5,1,2019-2-28,1,0,0
Could never get the thing connected. On my iPhone x the app took almost 30 minutes just to create an account. Thought something was wrong with my phone so I tried it on my girlfriends iPhone Xs Max and the same thing. It eventually made an account and allowed me to sign in. Start the setup process and as far as I could get was it attempting to connect to my network. I was on 2.4ghz not 5 and it kept timing out over and over again. After about an hour I gave up and submitted for a return. If it takes this long just to get the thing connected it can't possibly be reliable.

"I know a lot of people bring up privacy issues but that's not a issue for me.  Its not used for any areas that might be risky so I really couldn't care less if someone who I don't know is able to view the video.  In that regard I don't understand why some people are so uptight about that anyway.  Do you really think someone is sitting in a room looking at the video from thousands of cameras?  If you want to view risky video, there is a ton of it on the internet.  The cam has great video, the person detection feature is great and the price is cheap.  What's not to love!!  I'll probably buy more.",5,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0
"I ordered this because it was inexpensive and well rated, looked straight forward. But when I was trying to set it up the software REQUIRES you to have a wifi password to set the camera up. I have a house in the woods, no need for passwords and i'm not going to start using them. But there is NO WAY to set this camera up without one. And after reading some of the other reviews and the security issues, i'm glad I can't use this camera. It apparently is WAY too easy to access it using less savory methods. Just don't buy it, find something with better support and security.",1,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"I bought one of these to determine which of our 3 dogs is peeing in the house.  So far I haven't caught the culprit, but the camera is perfect for what I need to do.  It is small, insanely easy to setup.  It has a very goo night vision mode that does a very good job of illumination my entire loft.  The motion detection works very well.  I love that you can put in micro sd card & essentially have 24hr continuous recording if you want.  Or you can set it to only record when it detects motion.  You don't need to buy the Wyze sd card they sell any ol class 10 micro card 32g or less will do (although I would stick to more name brands like S a n D i s k just to have the quality)I will most likely be buying more of these to cover more of the house as time progresses.",5,1,2019-4-28,1,0,0
"This camera just works, I have one outside mounted to the soffit and it has had zero issues, the online recording is cheap and the software is easy to use, the picture quality is fantastic, and the motion detection is (while not fantastic) very good at this price point. If you don't have security cameras you should buy at least one and this one will not disappoint, if you have expensive cameras and just need one more for that blind spot you should give this one a try, I have spent a lot of money buying cheap cameras on Amazon and this one is my favorite",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0

"Great job Wyze!! After your end of year e-mail, I got to learn about Wyze company and how they came about. I really enjoyed the email and learning about this company when I honestly knew nothing and just purchased a cheap cam to do the job. Why spend hundreds on a cam when you can spend $25 and get the same quality with no monthly cost! The picture is great and though the sound quality can be better when talking on it, it does pick up sound not only close by but far away as well!!  I love this thing. Ended up buying another one and now I have them outside as my security cams. Only thing I'd love to add is an alert for motion detection which I hear they will be adding new features and more devices soon. I think I'll be buying more. Totally worth it!",5,1,2019-1-3,1,0,0
"My boss got a Nest cam and I liked the features. But the price, not so much. Along comes Wyze cam, this cam works with Alexa, does continual recording on SDHC and even has cloud storage for recorded events. The camera also has a speaker in it to talk to people from the camera. That's a lot of good features in a camera that is $25. When dealing with a camera this inexpensive you got to think about the picture quality. I have had some cameras in the past well over double the money of these and they don't compare to the picture quality of the Wyze camera. The color and sharpness is great, as well as the night vision. I had an issue with one camera and they took care of it immediately. Great deal for a great product.",5,1,2019-2-22,1,0,0

I've recommended this camera to others, and they've been very happy with it as well. The features are surprisingly robust, including things like Fire/CO2 alarm notifications, motion notifications, a speaker allowing you to talk through the camera, night vision, etc.Two small complaints: The picture quality in medium light conditions is a bit iffy. It's great in full light, and the night vision is surprisingly good as well, but medium lighting almost seems worse than pure darkness. Secondly, the microphone/speaker transmission through the app doesn't seem to be of very high quality. That being said, the features already far exceed what I would expect for the price, so I can't really fault it much. Overall, I'm extremely happy with this camera.",5,1,2018-12-26,1,0,0

I'm looking forward to what else WYZE comes out with. The cam is pretty good if you don't have an issue with having to power the unit with the USB cable.

Has issues being set up on a guest network. I have all of IOT devices on a guest network that does not allow the devices to see each other.

This cost about 1/5th as much as a competing camera I've been using, yet it was just as easy to setup and seems to work just as well. The app is simple to use and the notifications come through reliably. The only drawback is unrelated to the product itself, but Wyze disclosed they had a security breach and some user data was left open on a server. They said they corrected the situation quickly and vowed to improve security, but it's something to be aware of.",4,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
Item was defective - got the same symptoms as the other 1 star reviews on here.  The back light goes from yellow to blue every 20-40 seconds which suggests the connection is being lost again and again.  I was able to do a live stream to my iphone and even via alexa to my fire tv but the connection would be lost within a minute.  I had high hopes for this device given the reviews but looks like there is a high number of these that are not working/defective.  I did not have time to try another device given the other reviews and looking at more premium models.Troubleshooting did suggest that asus router owners should apply another setting but that did not work either.,1,1,2018-12-31,1,2,0
"I have better quality outdoor cameras but needed something simple to monitor the sump pump in my basement after my last pump stopped working and flooded my basement damaging my water heater and all my belongings. This little camera is GREAT! I keep it on the lowest resolution and is in the pitch dark 24/7 but sends notifications every time the sump pump goes off and if it senses any motion (captured a spider once!). I like being able to pull up the camera any time to check giving me a peace of mind rather than having to go outside, open the hatch and walk down to see if the water level is where it should be. I imagine if this camera works this well for something this simple in the dark it will be great for inside the house. I’ll definitely be getting a couple more.",5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,1
"***Update. I was about to return these.  The day I wrote the review both the Wyze app and IOS updated on my phone and iPad. Like magic, it works very well and i would say connectivity is 90 percent as opposed to 5 originally.  I’m much happier and upgraded from 1 star to 4 due to the poor motion sensor settings****.Original- Camera is great and takes high quality video. Otherwise completely unusable. I bought based on a friend’s recommendation and positive reviews here at the time. The motion sensor “notifications” are useless. I have two cameras set in windows overlooking my front and back yard. I mowed my entire lawn and it never caught me once. The app really NEVER works. I can connect maybe once a day. The camera captures every motion and records to the SD card. The video looks good. However, the app disconnects or freezes before you can find anything. What am I missing? How can any product with this many good reviews be this bad?",4,1,2018-5-18,1,0,0

"We purchased these for the person detection which worked fabulously. We had it set to only send notifications if a person was detected. I recommended these cameras to family & friends & they purchased them. If a fee months later & they removed the person detection. We had to turn off notifications because otherwise you'll get alerts on every little thing. Mow I no long know if someone has come in my yard. I give up checking because it's too many recordings. If you r buying these for person detection, find something else. I loved these cameras before that. So disappointed. They said they were working on it but instead released a scale & thermometer.

"These cameras are the best kept secret. For starters, the price point is approx. $100 less than D-Link, Samsung and other similar cameras. It has a true high def camera - that’s a picture of my front door (don’t judge). It works with Alexa Fire TV and my Alexa Show. I simply say “Alexa, show Livingroom on FireTV” and the love video stream plays on my television. I also purchased a Yi brand camera which purports to work with Alexa. My Yi camera, which was $49, is only capable of being turned on and off with Alexa - nothing more. Useless.My Wyze camera holds a 32 GB micro SD card which I have set for continuous recording. When it runs out of space it records over. If there is an issue, I have plenty of time to review footage before it’s recorded over.

We had just purchased an Arlo security system for our home and I was already disappointed in it as we knew our dog was stealing from the table and/or counter and it never seemed to catch it.  I was in a FB group where someone shared their dog doing just that.. and she told me about the Wyze when I asked.  Under $30 for every feature except a pc app and I feel captures more.  We put one in our 3 year old granddaughter's room as a monitor... but I will be buying more for areas of our home rather than waste so much more adding to that other system.,5,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"This camera is a perfect way to get another eye on your property.  We bought two - one to face the front of the house and one to face our backyard.  Both are located inside and pointed through double pane glass  - so we did have to turn the night vision off (otherwise all you see is a light reflected from the camera at night).  Even with the night vision off, they're still good.  You can adjust the motion detection range for recording - though it is only shaped like a rectangle (unlike the fully customizable shapes you can make with the Ring camera that costs 10 times as much).  Overall, it's a really good buy for the price.  We have a Ring doorebell but there are several angles it can't capture.  These cameras fill the gaps.",5,1,2019-4-23,1,0,0
"We dumped expensive ADT and installed our own system. It works with a single app, and has live views unlike ADT. No monthly fees, no fuss install, and easy on/off notifications! Adding several more cameras to cover blind areas then we have a ""blanket"" of protection around our home. The alternatives are way to expensive and come with reoccurring monthly fees that resemble a small mortgage payment. AND, the video quality is amazing for the low price. You can fetch a cheaper price on their own website but it doesn't include Amazon Prime shipping. SO, stick with these on Amazon and also get the warranty/return option if your not happy!

"Worst product purchased out of hundreds of other products. First you have to set it up with 2.4GHz too but the product mentions that it ""records"" with that selected network not set up too. Plus, if you set it up once and power of it goes out you have to setup AGAIN. Plus, not much info was given on how to setup, how it works, what is needed, etc. Other than it uses 2.4GHz for recording using a wifi AND they spy on you from another company in wherever they made this.

"These are really decent cameras.  They require a not-included MicroSD card, which is where they store video.  The only time the are online is when you request video from them, so they're not heavy on your wifi.  The data is stored locally, so they are somewhat vulnerable to theft.  If a thief takes it, your video is gone. They have motion detection with alerts, and decent software.  I don't know if they work with Alexa.  They've been a really good solution, and a revolution on the low-end camera market.  Their night-vision is adequate but not strong.  Their sound quality isn't great, either, but what do you expect for $25?  You can talk though them and scare the crap out of your roommate, so that's awesome.",5,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0

"It is a shame these do not have pan & tilt capability.  But, I won't knock the rating I give down because of that design choice.  The cameras provide a clear image in my environment.  The night vision capability is not as good as I need it to be, where I am reading utility meter dials in total darkness.  So, I use a small LED strip (3 to 6 LEDs only) that I turn on remotely with the Wyze WebCams (via WiFi remotely controlled electrical outlets).  I am pleased with the quality of image I get in these conditions.  If I need to see the dial readings more clearly I merely zoom in on the captured images.  The resolution is quite excellent.  They are easy to set up.  They represent a great value.  I will be getting more of these.",5,1,2019-6-10,1,0,1
"I bought this out of curiosity after learning about it on twit.tv. And I have to say it lived up to the review. Initially I used it at work to see who was messing with my tools and work bench at work. It is so small and easy to program, no one ever knew it was there. As it turned out, the software alerted me to a problem at work so I was able to intervene saving a lot of problems.I then brought it home to use as a baby monitor when my grandaughter stayed with us one night. Worked great, even in a mostly dark room.",5,1,2019-1-19,1,0,0
My use case is small. I utilized one camera to monitor pets while I’m at work.  The look and feel of the camera is great for its price point. The setup was simple via the mobile app. The free cloud space that holds  small clips from the previous 14 days is greatly appreciated. Video quality is good. Sound is ok. The speaker on the camera is loud for its size but you wouldn’t  want to have a conversation via the speaker.Since I live in a small apartment I’ve had no connectivity issues. I would test WiFi connection on your 2 ghz network first before installing these if they will be far from the router.,5,1,2019-1-27,1,0,0
"So far we like the camera itself. The camera takes a couple seconds to turn on and off through WiFi however it has a clear, crisp picture. Our disappointment resides in the Amazon Echo Show integration. We got this as part of a package deal and therefore expected smooth integration. Instead we have found that the camera as well as sound must be turned on and off the Wyze app directly so if your camera is off you cannot ask the Echo Show to turn it on. Instead the show can only “show” or “hide” the camera feed. The same with sound. If the camera sound is on, once the show “hides” the image we were still able to hear the sound and couldn’t turn it off. I’m hoping they just tried to push it out too fast and that these features will be corrected/added in the future and if so I will update my review. However as of now while we are enjoying the camera itself we’re disappointed with the integration so far which is the main reason we chose it over other cameras. That said, if you’re ok with leaving your camera on continuously then perhaps this would not be an issue for you.",2,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0

I've also power cycled every component of my network  repeatedly.

"Pros: It works in normal and low light/night vision and motion sensing is decent (adjustable). The stand is pretty adjustable and the adhesive included has allowed me to stick it to a wall without any issues. Straightforward connection to wifi and set up.Cons: Wireless refers to the fact that it connects to and sends data over wifi, not that it is cordless. It must be plugged in continuously to an outlet to work. The biggest issue is that you have to pay a monthly subscription to record videos longer than 12 seconds after the initial trial period they offer. From the time of motion detection to the end of 12 seconds is really quite short, so even if it detects motion, it is pretty useless if you want to see what is going on, unless you pay for the subscription.",4,1,2020-8-18,1,1,0

They are always disconnecting even though I have solid internet connections, it never fails when I click on one that it doesn't load. I have memory cards and all of my cameras and they were all recording, but some of them just randomly stopped recording, so when I go back to investigate and event the camera wasn't recording.

I can’t say enough great things about this camera. First off, the price is unbeatable, especially for this quality! Camera quality and motion/sound detection is awesome, lots of great features, compact size makes it easy to pack and bring along when we travel to visit family, and the temporary cloud storage of events is also fantastic.

I think a camera that you can't remote access is rather pointless, especially if somebody were to break into your home and steal the camera, you have no evidence as the thief has your camera with your SD card.  I have another camera from another manufacture that works great, records onto it's SD card and also onto my phone whenever there is motion, and I can watch it live from anywhere in the world that has internet connection.  I'd avoid this product, unless they can update the software to allow you to remove access it.",2,1,2019-1-23,1,0,0
Great little camera but install was a pain.  Set up and operation is dependent on an app for which I had no supported device.  There was a lot of mention that this camera is so easy to operate but I must have missed the part about the absolute need of a supported to device for their app installation or this little gem would be useless. Seems like a point that needs to be prioritized.  Luckily my persistence got me to a workaround posted on the internet.  Obviously I am not the only one to find myself in this frustrating situation.,3,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
I love the features and easy setup of this camera. I had been investigating a ring. But came across this. I have a small window above our front door. I run the power with an extended cable. And voila! 24/7 monitoring of anyone approaching our door. I do not enable the audio nor the night vision (we have a street light that provides adequate coverage). Easy to set the detection area to avoid car traffic triggering events. There is no way to beat the 14 day free rolling cloud storage. I’m buying another one for inside coverage. I actually tested it there first. It was flawless. The only thing I wish I could have for the inside is that it would allow me to define detection times per day. Versus the same time range 7 days a week. Hopefully that will come in a future software update.,5,1,2019-1-19,1,0,0
If you go out and want to view the camera when you aren’t home the whole point of having this camera it will tell you that because you aren’t connected to WiFi you can’t view or see the camera or the room the camera is in so it’s a huge waste of money I will definitely do more research before making a security camera purchase again,1,1,2020-10-1,1,1,0
Really good quality for a great price.Get a 32 GB micro SD card. It makes a difference. They give you 14 days of storage of motion detection BUT it only records 12 seconds of that motion then stops. Then you get 12 more seconds after it picks up the motion again.,5,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
"These things are way better than you'd think.  They actually work as advertised!  The only caveat is to respect the operating temperature range.  I've found that the unit that watches for Amazon deliveries (though the front window) has been flawless...never needs a reboot, never has a problem.  On the other hand, the units in the garage (on mice sentry duty) tend to freeze up (literally) when the temperature drops below about 20F (not bad, given that it's rated for 32F).  They're tremendous fun (and useful too!).  The experience of reviewing video on the app isn't nearly what you get from a Nest...but it does work.

I have a Wyze Cam Pan and that all works fine so don't know why this unit is so troublesome.

"It is unfortunate that a great camera is ruined by awful motion detection. As many other reviews have stated the motion detection will just not work for periods of time and then suddenly start working again. I believe this to be a bug with the app because if you set motion detection to ""all day"" it works just fine. In my circumstance it is unrealistic to have the camera detect motion all day and then have to sift through hundreds of clips to find 1 specific event. On top of this, there is an arbitrary limit of 12 seconds for recording during motion detection events and a ""cooldown"" period of about 5 minutes. For me this makes the camera useless.If motion detection is not important to you then I would highly recommend this camera. The app is great and connects you to the camera every time.",2,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"I moved into a new house and found that a few small rats were coming from the crawl space into the cabinet under my sink. To make sure they were going into the trap before I turned it on, I set up the camera. At the end of the video you will see the rat leave through a tiny crack in the cabinet. Without the camera, I never would have known to seal that crack up or when to set the trap. I returned a different brand camera because it had connectivity issues and overheated, this one has been flawless for two weeks and it's been on the whole time. My only complaint would be to be able to change the length of the motion detection events, but you can record from the playback feature too, so it's fine. Also it would be great to have the option to run it on a battery or charge instead of power only. I got a power pack so I can run it when there is no oulet, but that's a pain to keep recharging. Also, being able to use a large microsd card would be nice. But amazing for $26.",5,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0

The sound is not perfect, but my dog knows it's me and I'm sure a thief/burglar would know he's not alone.

I plan on trying out some 3rd party firmware that give it RTSP support, making it viewable on web browsers. You learn if you want to monitor activity outside at night, you're going to have to mount it outside, or the infrared light is reflected off your window rendering it pointless. Since it uses usb only for power, I imagine you can run a long cable to it.  You also could use one of those +2500ma usb battery packs for smartphones to run it. Like the strong magnet in the base so you can mount it to a metal surface or plate outside.Did get into a state where it became completely unresponsive to controls or app crashes after 10 seconds.

The camera installed and connected easily without issue.  With the help of Wyze videos and review videos I was able to set up the features the way I want.  Picture quality is good even when using night vision.  I haven’t used the sound features much other than to try it out.  It's not great.  If there’s a volume control, I haven’t found it yet.  I’ve had it only a few days and so-far-so-good.  I use it to monitor activity at my front door.  The only issue I’ve found, so far, is that the motion detection is not activated by motion, it's activated by pixel changes.  As a result, I get a notification when my porch light goes on or off and, on a cloudy day, I get notifications when the sun peeks out – every time - even though there's no motion.  It would be nice if the notifications came only with motion rather than light changes.  I’d be happy to pay a few more bucks to have the motion sensor not trigger with light changes.  Overall, considering the price, I think it’s great.  Considering the price, really shouldn't complain.  I've already ordered a few more.",4,1,2018-12-22,1,0,0
"This produce has no clear instructions to get the full use of this product! They fail to tell you that each of your cameras has to have it own “network” on your router ! I wanted to have the camera to turn on and record on motion only ! Once I set the camera up ,I also purchased the 32 gb micro cards to install on the cameras, then I turned them on they worked fairly well! Yet then I am home I don’t want them to record every time someone walks into the room so I turn them off! Then when I go to work I come home and see that my dogs have ravaged the house and yet when I look at the cameras they show me nothing ! What a crap product! I thought that once I set the camera up it would save my settings ! It should have plenty of memory ! I also set them to record on the micro cards I haven’t connected them to the cloud that is even a bigger head ache ! Guess you get what you pay for! They are cheap crap!",1,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"honestly for the money you cannot beat this camera. I purchased 2 for our home just to test out because they are cheap enough, and 🤯 these things are absolutely amazing. Crystal clear video and audio quality, you can set it up to send notifications for the montion sensors and run everything through the wyze smart app. Ive seen professional security systems that cost 10x as much as these that don't perform as well as these do. Cameras and app tie together flawlessly. Well done wyze.  I will be ordering a few more soon to cover all the entrances of my house.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"The camera works pretty good for the price. The biggest gripes are the over compression of the video. HD and SD look almost identical because the video is compressed so much. The night vision works about 10 ft. I purchased a separate IR light that is much brighter and now I can see 30+ ft. The motion detection works, but it detects bugs all night long flying in front of the camera. The detection sensitivity doesn't seem to stop bugs from being detected. If the video was less compressed or the compression level could be adjusted I would give this a 5 star rating.",4,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"this video cameras useless. I tried to record a video. And on my smartphone it says I need a microSD card to play video playback. This is useless because it doesn't save automatically to the cloud, you need a microSD card to play video feedback. This is a waste of money. When I record a video, I would like it saved on medically to the cloud not a MicroSD card. I'm not going to go buy a micro SD card for my phone. This is completely useless I would never recommend this to anyone. I basically just wasted my money.",1,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"These are great little cams. Don’t let the price fool you into thinking they are junk. They are small so they fit anywhere and they adjust in every imaginable angle. I love the little metal disk that sticks to the window sill or window frame, wherever you want to put it. The cam has a magnetic bottom that sticks tight to the disc. Great idea and pretty good app. Easy connect too. I have 4 of these and the cord is flat so I can easily slip it through the shutters without it looking obvious. Works with Alexa too😃",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"Great customer support for questions.  I'm currently running it as a door cam and have tested it as a dash cam with good results, albeit I will likely use their Pan Cam for the dash cam.  Very flexible design such that you can have fun just figuring out what you can use it for.  With the sensor kit installed, I used the itty, bitty motion detector to signal me when the washer in the garage stops rotating and then, set it up to do the same thing for the ever ""time to finish"" changing dryer;  Worked like a champ.  The ""person"" detection is useful when using it as a door cam.",5,1,2019-8-18,1,0,0
"I had high hopes for this camera but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. It's probably great for those who are looking for a nanny cam, although it wouldn't hide very well. It would have worked better for me if there was a way to zoom. I purchased it to watch a mama hummingbird hatch her eggs. I placed the camera just a few feet from the nest but the videos, when played back, are too small to clearly see anything. Obviously people are finding use for it but I should have sent it back. My trail camera did a much better job.",3,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"I have a total of 12 Wyze Cams and Wyze Cam Pans, all with Wyze SD cards installed.  I monitor a 2nd home located 900 miles away. Initially they worked pretty well and I kept purchasing more of them.  However, within the last two weeks and subsequent to a recent app update,  I can rarely reliably connect to any of them remotely.  I could go into the details of why I think that their network infrastructure is going into melt-down as a result of their poor implementation decision regarding person detection but it is too technical.  This company has lost their focus with the release of a myriad of very cheap loosely related products that barely work and decline in performance of their original camera products.  The real demonstration of their loss of focus was when they started selling cheap Chinese face masks to capitalize on the covid-19 pandemic.  What do paper face masks have to do with cameras or home monitoring.  They are just another re-marketer of cheap Chinese products that is out to make a fast buck but has no idea of how to develop or support consumer tech products.  I'm pretty sure that they will be out of business within a year and that their venture capital funders are very uneasy.  Enough said.  Wyze is not worth any more of my time or money.",1,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0

"...I need a spy camera only to record on an SD card, no need for real-time viewing or alerts on my iPhone... It took me some time to test and realize that even though I can set it up at home, in a WiFi environment, once I take it out to the parking garage, with only very weak public WiFi — it's not gonna work... So this product does not fit my current needs, BUT IT'S STILL A REALLY GREAT CAMERA!!! And, BTW, I used a 64GB MicroSD card — and it was recording fine.",4,1,2019-1-29,1,1,0
I really like the industrial design of this camera. It incorporated stand as one piece so it will give the camera some more angles to work with. The set up was fairly easier except the QR code scanning took a while to take.I turned on the motion detection continuous filming. I am not sure the algorithm is the best. For example I used the camera to see what neighborhood cats came to eat cat food I left outside. The camera would start filming when a cat is all the way in the yard as opposed to from wherever it came from. The clip ended before a cat walked all the way out. So sometimes I don't actually get the whole motion.,5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,1
"Hooked this camera to an Echo Show. Hookup was very simple, however the camera is just ridiculously cheap quality. Yes, the camera did display on the Echo, but with about a minute or 2 behind. So not a true live feed. The quality of this camera’s video is just choppy. I absolutely was embarrassed to bundle this camera with my son’s Echo Show for Christmas. We both agreed this camera was just the quality of something that came from a Dollar Store. I’ll stick to my Ring Video Doorbell., now that’s is quality live feeds with beautiful resolution. This WYZE is total junk and went into the trash on Christmas Day, it was that bad.",1,1,2018-12-30,1,1,0
"These are the absolute best little cameras! I love the Wyze service, I love not having to pay a subscription fee to get regular snapshots. The app works really well and the sound quality and video quality are great. My father installed a much more expensive brand at his house and made me get him several of these for his backyard, and he is telling everyone he likes them Better and paid about 20% of the price for them!

"I think this product is marketed as a security camera, but explicitly disavows that as a use in the user agreement.  And it is very clear why: the product barely works.  The app is ridiculously bug-filled.  The videos can't be retrieved, alerts don't come through sometimes for 30 or 40 minutes, sometimes the cameras remain on when you shut them off, and that's just ordinary UI. The product clearly just isn't ready for any meaningful use.  I can't imagine, if this little care went into UI dev, that the backend is any more functional or secure.",1,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"Such a pity: this camera captures good video and it's easy to set up. It would have been a keeper if only the app reliably allowed viewing of the video.Who knows, the manufacturer might actually have a solution, but after three days of waiting for a support response, it was time to give up on Wyzecam and try a competitor's product.",1,1,2018-11-30,1,2,0
It says wireless but it isn't also you have to pay for a subscription to use most benefits. It's good little Camera though had clear but vision i love that i can talk through it and can have it record of a motion or sound sensor goes off.

"So I bought this because I’ve had some plants stolen from my porch. I have it set up to record when it detects movement. It detected me driving up the driveway just fine, however it did not record me actually walking onto the porch directly in its view. What gives? So basically I’m back to square one if it doesn’t detect actual humans walking on the porch.Update after using it for months. It detects basically nothing anymore except rain and snow. I have mail delivered every day and it never catches it. Once in a while it will catch my son coming or going in his car. I have people walking directly past it daily and it catches nothing. It’s on the most sensitive setting too.",1,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0
"So far, so good. App use is intuitive, responsive, and the price is right. My only complaint so far is extreme sensitivity for motion detection. Any shadows in the room will trigger a notification with the lowest sensitivity set. It is possible to set a smaller portion of the frame to trigger motion alerts, but I feel the sensitivity setting still needs work.",4,1,2018-10-12,1,2,0
Picture and speak work great. It doesn’t  rotate. It also doesn’t have cloud storage though it says it does. Huge disappointment. What’s the point of having if I have to have a memory card?! The only thing it saves is occasional movement. Some can easily take out memory card if they’re robbing you and you won’t have record of it. The volume on the speaker is loud. It doesn’t get every word but works good 90% of the time. I like my YI cam better.,1,1,2019-2-20,1,1,0
"Best bang for the buck in IP Cam business!! Worth 5 stars, but for its required app, no SD card support. Recordings are stored in your device memory with NO option to use your external memory if you have an SD card set up for that. (A one hour HD video is 0.33GB which is quite acceptable in itself.)  This is an inexplicable oversight or a developer's short-cut, either of which gets the one star. I'll change that to five if they ever update it.",1,1,2019-2-24,1,1,0
"I bought this little camera for little extra security in the garage.  The quality of video and sound is good.  I found that the sound sensors picks up everything.  The motion sensor seems to be hit or miss at times.  At night it would pick up a small bug that flies past it but when I walked in front of it quickly it didn’t seem to capture or trigger the motion sensor.  Video quality is great with both SD/HD.  It doesn’t have internal storage or cloud storage so you will need to purchase an SD card for that.  Overall, it’s a great little camera for a very cheap price and would definitely recommend for indoor use.  Side note that these can be installed outside however you would need to use a special housing to protect it from the outdoor elements.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"The camera seems OK, when it does work. The main problem seems to be how weak the wifi is, and the unfortunate lack of an Ethernet port. Night vision works well, and the detecting people even finds dog faces. But if it isn't in the same room as my router, it constantly disconnects whenever I do anything (switch audio on, change to HD, transmit voice, etc).I don't think I'll be able to use this upstairs, since it doesn't stay connected in my living room.",2,1,2018-8-6,1,2,0

Even able to point it out the window. If it’s reflecting the window, simply turn off Night Vision. Ordered another 1 hour after setup when I saw what kinda jewel it was. The app works great on my iPhone. I even have the ability to tell a robber to, “GET THE FLIP OUT OF MY HOUSE,” remotely:-) I’m truly amazed for $25. Go ahead and get Micro SD Card while you’re waiting on camera to arrive. That way, you can film all day.",5,1,2018-8-14,1,1,0
"Works like a charm, only complaint is that I can't seem to get the notifications to work? I'm not sure why but that's not a huge deal for me as I'm using for a baby monitor so I just check the camera feed every so often. There is also I'd say about 10 second delay in the video feed but I'm willing to bet that has more to do with my internet. Overall I'm very pleased, can't beat the price for sure! Nice bonus that it works with Alexa! Nice to be able to quickly bring the camera up on my living room TV.

"This is an awesome little camera that does exactly what it says it does without any surprises. After trying three other more expensive cams I finally found this gem. Great image, great motion detection, and finally software that works and is well though out. The setup was a breeze. Very clever design. Attaches easily to many surfaces. I don’t write many reviews but this product deserves it. Better than other cams two and three times the price. You won’t be disappointed. I hope they consider making a battery powered version at some point. Well done.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
The price in this was great.  It’s easy to use.  No network connectivity probs which I’ve had with the much more expensive cloud cam.  I was able to use this from work to check and see if our power had come back on after a recent storm.  Couldn’t tell with the cloud cam because it wasn’t reconnecting to the network.  It would be a good cheap security cam. I prefer the cloud cam for watching my pets though.,3,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"I did not expect to like this camera so much. I have another brand that we use for security in our home. But i am a hedgehog breeder and wanted something less expensive to monitor my hedgehogs when i pair them and when they’re expected to deliver. A breeder friend suggested it s i bought only 1, that way if i didn’t like it i wouldn’t be out too much money. Well i LOVE it. It was super easy to pair to the app. I can now watch my babies even when I’m at work. I want to buy like 100 more just to have them stashed away lol.These would be great little presents for any animal lover. They can check in on their baby from work or school!

Never have a problem with it picking up stuff at night. So far this is one of the best cameras I’ve used.",5,1,2019-7-14,1,1,1
The audio both receiving and transmitting isnt perfect and hard to actually converse with. I did purchase this cam for my dogs for when they are outside barking and it has been the best anti bark device yet. I've tried collars and other means but this has been the best means to change their habits. I like that I can set the noise alerts so that I can log in and break their attention to stop their barking at persons walking by. I also get alerts for a second cam as to when someone is at my front door. I do not recommend using as a substitute to a camera doorbell like Ring due to the lack of great audio. I plan to purchase a Ring soon for that reason.,5,1,2019-1-31,1,0,0
"I was excited to try this inexpensive camera, but was immediately disappointed when I plugged it in and nothing happened.

I contacted Amazon about getting a new Wazy cable, but I'm still waiting to hear back.The camera itself has not given me any issues so far, (two days).

"camera is great, i liked it so much that i wanted to keep it and return the echo that i purchased with it. The  camera was a 10 dollar add on to my 49.99 echo. But when i tried to return the echo they stated that my return value was 39 dollars and the camera was 20. i went rounds with the amazon chat people who also stated this. Then finally admitted that they never had a promotional value for the echo 5 for 39 dollars and that i was correct, it was 49 dollars, but could only do a promo for me to get 10 dollars off of the next item i purchased, to make up for this. I explained this wouldn't  work since it was a family account. i then spoke to a supervisor who went on to tell me i was wrong and that i paid 39 for the echo and 20 for the camera. i reviewed what the other person told me but insisted they were incorrect and i didn't remember right either. they said they were unable to look back at past deals or read any article about their black friday deals either. i don't know how it is legal for them to change the cost of items when you go to return them. I asked if they could provide me somewhere when i purchased that the item prices would change but they  weren't able to provide me with that.

"I purchased these on a recommendation from a friend and I have NOT been disappointed.  They are super simple to set up, I would say maybe 5 minutes to set up if you include the un-boxing.  I used these to replace some other cameras that I had which started giving me problems.  The cameras I replaced cost five times as much as these ones.  You can add in a Micro SD card if you want to record to memory.  The app is simple to use.  I have added several more to my inventory since they are so cheap to purchase.  They have a nice magnetic base and also a little integrated riser so you can turn the camera to nearly any angle to get the right view.  I did have an issue with two of my cameras after a few months so I had to reach out for customer support.  Customer support was great and the issued ended up being the memory cards I had used.  I replaced the memory cards and have not had an issue since.",5,1,2018-12-25,1,0,0

"Took forever to get it to connect.  Finally connected without really changing anything.  It just randomly worked.  Camera kept going in and out. Upgraded firmware and then it won't work at all.  Don't even try tech support -- they are non-existent.  Spend 30 minutes on hold before hanging up.  No cue line, no notice of how long I am expected to hold -- just lousy service.  Don't buy it.",1,1,2019-7-23,1,1,0
OK I don't understand how this can be wireless as I have it plugged in for a long time and it never charged to not have the device plugged in. Then it will work sometimes and I have it on top of my wireless modem and it still says that it cannot connect. I must be doing something wrong because this darn thing hasn't and I really needed it for while I was away. I am not sure how to reset it either and then all of a sudden it reset itself. I am not sure if you must buy the subscription in order for it to work but I haven't gotten this dumb thing to work at all.  Worst product ever and I can't waste any more time trying to make it work.,1,1,2019-5-20,1,0,0
"This little camera is perfect for what we need. The software is constantly being update which helps strengthen the features of the camera. It was easy to install, you just need a plug and wi-fi. We have ours set up to monitor the entire front area of our house. We have ours inside looking out a front window. We do not use the night vision feature because there is obviously a glare against the window pane. But, we have enough lights in the street to decipher movement of animals, vehicles, and people. The clarity is better than store surveillance cameras. Will be ordering more.",5,1,2019-8-3,1,0,0
Believe the hype. In 10 minutes or less I had the camera set up and watching over my front porch. It gives me alerts when something big moves in an area that I defined. You can adjust the sensitivity of the alerts so bugs don't set it off. For the life of me I can't see why someone would pay $200 for a camera (that spies on you for it's maker) when this little guy does a great job for 10% of the price. Just buy it.,5,1,2019-5-1,1,1,0
"Works great. Easy to setup and use. Motion alerts pop up on my phone quickly and it captures all motion, change in light and sound. I miss nothing. The alerts are customizable to reduce alerts or if you just want capture people motion and not the dog or lighting outside. Unlike others, it continually records so I can see exactly what went on.  Others record for a minute and stops until the next alert. You can watch on your Echo Show or Fire TV.  With this camera, you’ll always know what the kids and/or pets are up to.",5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"I got this for a client who wanted to be able to see visitors to her shop while she was away since some package deliveries were stolen. The app works well and is easy to set up, as is the camera.

"The product was easily hacked by a neighbor and a stalking crime happened as a result. In trying to determine how and why this happened, I learned that these and similar other cameras are often used by hackers and spies in the developing world to aid in identity theft and in some cases espionage.Then the product stopped connecting to any wifi, I tried troubleshooting but it was no help.

"I bought one of these cameras so that I could take a look at my sweet dog during the day while at work and did not expect much but wow!  What a great buy!  It provided a nice, broad view, was a snap to hook up (plug in USB to an outlet, download the free app,  adjust to get the view you would like, DONE!)  I don’t use an SD card because I’m unconcerned about recording activity so I can’t comment on the quality of the playback but live feed is outstanding.  The sound from the camera is very LOUD - so loud that the first day I used it, I was calling my dog  using a normal tone of voice and it scared her so badly she had an accident, so be sure to mute it if your goal is to be stealth.  The app has all kinds of preference adjustments, from sensitivity to timing of check-ins, I had mine set originally to notify me of any motion but my cel phone was going off all day long!  I turned off the notification and use it to pop in occasionally and (quietly!) say hello to Holly now, LOL.  Great buy, glad I have it!",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"We timidly bought 2 of them at the beginning: 1 Wyze Cam and Wyze Cam Pan and we were greatly surprised. The speed and quality of the image, the features that offers, the wide angle and also he app is very good. It has settings for  1) smoke and CO alarm sound  2) motion and sound 3) night vision (excellent!) 4) 180 degrees image rotation (in case you need to hook it upside down)5) Camera on/off status light 6) timestamp watermark.  You can insert an SD card (I have 32Gb Class10 micro card) and choose to store events only or continuous recording. If your power socket is far awar from where you want to install the camera (like us), you can buy the 26ft extension kit.With all these features we went on and bought 4 more and we are thrilled that we can check on our mum and her carer(s) and even talk to her through the cameras. Honestly you wont regret it, especially for this money.",5,1,2019-5-18,1,0,0
"I bought three of these units and two have failed after only a few months.Update: I decided to give Wyze another try, despite the two failed units. After a firmware update, the new unit repeatedly would not connect.

I am done with this product.",1,1,2019-1-31,1,1,0
"I bought three of these cameras and have had them up for a few days now - just added the micro SD cardsSo far, I have been nothing but impressed. I haven't had any of the connectivity issues that were reported earlier and video quality has been more than sufficient in all lighting conditions. The app is solid, intuitive, and overall developed very well. I hope that development continues at a rapid pace. There are quite a few features they could implement easily to make the user experience even better.",5,1,2017-12-14,1,7,0
"It’s difficult to beat the value. I’ve used these in my garage and looking through a window as an inexpensive means to monitor the front door and garage door. The recent “Person Detection” feature has been a great improvement to reduce nuisance alarms, but it has missed person detection in some instances. I understand that Wyze is continuously fine tuning it. Right now, I’ve still got a more extensive camera system as my primary means of recording activity. But, these Wyze cameras have been awesome to “fill the gaps” as complimentary portable cameras.",5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0

But you can not view it thru the ring app.  The HD picture is nice and sharp even via night vision.  The option that starts recording on motion and sound detection, then pushes notifications to your cell?with the recording is awesome.

Factory reset the camera multiple times, ANd it's still bad. About 90% of the time the app cannot connect to the camera. WHat good is a camera that NEVER connects.Customer service is just as bad as well. It's as if they have script of things to say to you and run through the same exact process each time I contact them.

"Amazon sold them as a kit together.  Only issue as with other Amazon products the App for the camera is only on Google Android.  I had to configure the camera via the app on my android phone.  I get the motion detection notifications on my phone, not on the Echo Show.  I wanted a notification if someone walked up to the door, it will show up on the Echo Show.  Camera works great!! - Echo functionality needs help on the app side.I purchased it for my mom and the camera is on the front window.  She can see out the front window just by saying Alexa show me the front yard.  Second issue is you can only run one app at a time, it would be nice to have the camera on the screen and music playing.  Definitely room for improvement on the Amazon Echo Show.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"These work well. My issue is with them not capturing an event for a longer period of time. by the time the camera starts recording the motion has already started and it turns off before the motion is finished. Currently it's 12 seconds but should be more like 1 minute. If motion leave the area of camera and comes back in 2 seconds later, the camera doesn't catch it because it just turned off and it happened too fast. Our other cameras allow us to choose capture time. 15 seconds, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min.",4,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
I am completely impressed with this little camera.  It has a great picture.  The motion detection works better than it needs to.  I can only give the night vision 4 out of 5 stars but is better than expected for the price.  It was very easy to set up with my iphone.  Very user friendly to operate and it uploads to the cloud to boot.  14 days free backup is beyond expected.  The motion detection is easy to adjust to your needs.  It does not backup 24/7 but with the motion detection is captures everything I need with out using up all my data.  I have an Amcrest but have never gotten it to operate as I needed or wanted.  I bought 4 Wyze cameras for the price of the Amcrest.  Way way happy.  I am technology 'stupid' and I was able to set this up at an awesome price.,5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,1
"Works just as described. I receive notifications on my phone app when motion is detected. Sometimes it’s delayed, but we have spotty internet connection, so it could be the reason.It records for 12 seconds once the motion is detected. Or you can have continued feed recorded on the sd card and auto renewed recording every 4 days. Also can watch live feed if that’s what you prefer. I now have 2 cameras: one for motion detection and another for life feed that I monitor from my computer. For the low price cost, these cameras exceeded my expectations.",5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0

I love this camera. I use it as a baby monitor. It alerts me with a push notification if there is any sound or movement from the room/baby. I’ve had no issues with this camera and want to buy more for other areas of the home. I really love the price point. I feel like I’m getting more for my money rather than throwing $200+ out the window for a brand name baby monitor.,5,1,2018-8-31,1,2,0
"I am super happy with this purchase!! I have this cam plugged in at my work office. I work at a college and my office is at the end of the hall closest to the door. Lately we've been having break-ins and I seriously have a lot of expensive things. I love that I can set motion/sound detection on at a specific time frame and all is controlled from my phone. A cool feature I later learned is being able to set a time lapse so I could see how productive (or unproductive haha) I am in my work day.The only honest downside I can think of is that there is a little bit of an audio delay when I review my footage. But other than that, it's so worth the price!!",5,1,2019-1-1,1,0,0
I can not properly rate this product as it will not connect to my system. There is no way to reach the help line as it rings one time and immediately disconnects.

This camera exceeds my expectations!! For a 25$ camera you can not beat this! We got a camera to watch our senior dog after having surgery and it is the best thing ever! Clear video daytime and night! Super easy to set up and only took less than 5 minutes! We connected it with our Alexa Show and that took us only 2 minutes! One phone can set it up and then they can share it to another phone so somebody else can be able to see the live stream as well! We have no problems with connectivity either. Not sure why people are giving it bad reviews. I would give this 10 stars if possible! It put our minds at ease so THANK YOU. And with Amazon Prime it came the same day we ordered it! Can't beat it!!,5,1,2019-5-17,1,0,1

Works well. I got the outdoor case for it so that I could use it outside monitor my front gate. I love that I can view it from anywhere with my phone. I also like that I can set where the motion detection is so that I don't get notifications for every car that drives by or every time my dog walks around in my yard.The only thing I don't like is that you must have wifi for it to work.,5,1,2020-3-23,1,0,1
"The build quality of this device is fantastic and the price is unbeatable, but I've had two major issues so far after several weeks of continuous use:1. The detection sensor doesn't work so fine as it should and it advertised. I've adjusted the sensibility several times and still doesn't catch some major movements in front of it. Hard to believe but it happens to me. How do I know?? Well, I own two cameras, one of them pointing out towards my garage exit. I leave to and come back from work everyday at the same hours. When I review the events from the camera it only has recorded some of the days, not all. I don't know what else should I do, but is hard to believe that a car moving right in front of the camera is not recorded as an movement event. Don't know what to do about it.",3,1,2019-4-17,1,0,0

The web is full of Wyze customers desperately trying to figure out how to get rid of the dreaded ""code 90"" connectivity problem.

"I was skeptical of the reviews regarding quality of picture and usability, but due to recent thefts, vandalism etc. we decided to check it out.  We are able to mount this on the inside of our house, viewing the drive and exterior entry way. We mounted it upside down and use the app to flip the picture 180 degrees.  The picture quality allows us to zoom in and determine true facial features.  The app allows fine tuning of the motion sensing to decrease the amount of false alerts (cars driving by, etc.).  Within two days of installation, our neighborhood lost power....argh....when the power returned, and the WiFi rebooted, the camera came back online without issue.

I almost always have my phone on me so I am able to keep an eye on my kiddos very easily and it puts me at ease. I do wish you were able to zoom to specific spots and change the sound on it when I use it to talk it crazy sounding and actually scares the crap out of my kids. Also although I understand that the red dots when dark are for the darkness.. it also freaks my kids out a bit but I explain to them what it is for. One last thing I actually wouldnt mind paying a little amount more for them to switch to wireless.",4,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0

Originally I went to Best Buy and almost purchased a Ring. Then did more research on different cams. I could get quite a few of these Wyze cams for the same price of 1 Ring or Nest cam. And there is no monthly fee.The picture quality is great! We tested the 2-way audio which works great too.

This camera is the worst possible piece of hardware I have ever had the misfortune of purchasing. Unfortunately it's well past the time when I can return it I'm thinking of taking it and just storing it in a box and sending it back anyway just so they'll have one more that they have to throw away instead of me.

"Ill never recommend WYZE again. after 1 year of perfect use, they've now stopped showing videos of anything person-triggered (why else would you want the cam) and you have to pay monthly after a short trial period. Now that WYZE is charging, they used to be the only free cam out there that recorded any motion-trigger event to a 12 sec cloud free of charge, you should go with another more high quality cam like NEST. WYZE starts as free, then you can't use the service without signing up for a trial that expires and ends in a charge for the basic services.",1,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"I watched a few YouTube reviews of this product and was interested enough to try it for myself but I wasn't a believer yet. When the package arrives, I was excited to get it plugged and so I could see the quality for myself. From the second I turned on the camera till it was streaming to my phone was maybe 2-3 minutes which was very impressive. We've tried a few no-name cameras here and the setup process was very complicated and took forever. That was when I first realized how powerful this camera was.I installed it outside above the garage and spent a little bit of time dialing in the zone and sensitivity and to my surprise, it works PERFECTLY. The picture is clear, the alerts come quickly, the recordings capture what we need to see, etc. Since then we purchased a second unit and I plan to buy a few more.",5,1,2019-5-24,1,0,0

As I said, it was an easy setup for me to connect to my wireless internet and to download on my phone.

As noted in my Wyze Cam Pan review, we use these cameras primarily to monitor our pack of Great Pyrenees pups when we are away and the 2 way remote voice feature is a game changer.  We also use these cameras for home monitoring/security.The install is so easy a child could do it.  The quality of the video, photos and sound are fantastic for a product in this price range - far exceeded our expectations!  The video and photos are in color and playback video is clear and crisp.

I tell them “shhhhhhhhh” annoyingly,  when I set things up like a security camera.

It was easy to insert the micro SD card (for continuous recording and playback). It also has a really great app. Wonderful.

Wow! I hesitated to purchase bc there were some concerns that the negative reviews mentioned about security. I decided to purchase anyway and see how I like it myself. Best decision so far! I use it for a live feed just to keep an eye on my baby during naps and bedtime and I LOVE how easy it was to set up on a corner of the room and just how much space is covered! I can see the whole room with this camera. I purchased this one bc one I bought specifically a baby monitor cost me close to $80 and only worked for a month!

I'm really not sure how this camera has such good reviews. This camera has extremely bad background noises that sounds like a tv on as well as knocking noises that sounds like someone is in your home when the home is absolutely silent. We purchased this camera to use while on vacation and we're very alarmed when the camera was picking up noises that were not actually there. Phone call to the police later and ended our vacation early for noises that didn't even exist. I do not recommend this camera at all and will be returning ours. It defeats its purpose on so many levels.,1,1,2020-10-3,1,0,0
About this when I moved into a new apartment complex and my truck got vandalized two times in one week. It works great for night vision it works great during the day I don’t know that I would actually be able to identify someone I didn’t know if they were breaking into my truck. Just because of the distance and the picture quality if you zoom in. But it has recorded and has Aided and deterring any vandalism in our building.

She goes months without bothering it, but the minute she decides to eat it, it's all over and it could kill her! So glad I found this tool to help keep her safe!",5,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"Nicely priced camera with great picture quality. Unfortunately the SD Card slot will not detect an SD Card and the motion detection is horrible. I live in an apartment and have it pointed at my front door. I’m not a small guy and the camera will still not pick me up walking through the door. The motion detection boxes show I’m there but the camera will not send a notification that motion was detected. It will however pic up if there is a lighting condition change. Meaning if I turn a light on or off it’ll detect that. Wanted to like this product, but ultimately with these two major flaws the camera is a fail. I’ll be sending it back.",2,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0
"I bought 3 of these cameras. They would be amazing if they didn't ""freeze"" up every 6-10 hours and require re-booting. I have tried them at multiple locations and different wifi networks. They continue to give ""movement notifications"" but you can't view live streaming or playback without unplugging and resetting. This gets very aggravating real fast. Wyze customer service did very little to assist me with this problem...",1,1,2018-4-11,1,2,0
I like this product at stores on the SD card so I don’t have to pay for a service I can check in on the house at any time I can also talk through it and listen in The only downfall is with my settings I have to contact customer service still is supposed to send me an alert when it detects a person and it has never done that even when there is a person and detection box shows the square around the person needless to say I have ordered a second one And I’m awaiting the outdoor Cams release,3,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"Camera works very well! Very small, but great picture. I've purchased two additional cameras after getting the first. Super easy to set-up and nice to simply add another camera to the Wyze App. The night vision was better than I expected having had small similar cameras that have terrible night vision. Really haven't used the microphone to talk to anyone so I can't comment on that. Also in our house when I've logged in and 2-3 people are talking it is very loud when you turn of the audio to listen, but I don't really use it. It's for checking in on the house, dog, and teenagers when we are not at home. Also placed one to constantly film our driveway/front door just to keep an eye on any deliveries.",4,1,2019-9-2,1,1,0
"I initially bought 2 of these to see how I liked them and how they performed. The price made me worried that they would be less than useful. After using the 2 for about a week I quickly ordered two more for the house. They work extremely well, they are easy to set up and the app works well too. I bought them to help keep an eye on our baby and didn't want to buy the more expensive brands if I didn't have to.  I have a ""traditional"" baby monitor but haven't really used it because these work so well. The night vision works extremely well to where I can see if her eyes are open or not.I give them a 4 start rating and not a 5 is because of the audio. You can hear pretty well what is going on the room but it's a second or two out of synch and the two way communication is not great. If the person is not sitting by the unit they usually can't hear you. At least that is my experience.",4,1,2018-1-9,1,2,0
"We wanted a way to keep an eye on our kids around the house during the summer so this was a good cheap way to do that. The picture quality is good in very well lit areas. It’s so so in dim areas where the kids like to play video games in the dark. Sometimes it switches on/off IR mode often in the middle of the day to the point where I turn it off. My biggest complaint is sound. You cannot hear clearly conversations in a room I tried different locations in the room of camera placement to try to hear better, but no luck. I guess that’s just the quality you get for the price. If you just want to be able to look in on something I would recommend this but for any type of security purposes I don’t trust it enough",2,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0
I use this to keep an eye on my son when others are watching him. This works to amazing! I loved it so much I bought another to put it my room. For 25 bucks you get a amazing value! I would recommend this to anyone.*Update*,3,1,2019-3-12,1,0,0
I use this camera to monitor the front of my house. I purchased an exterior mount for the camera and it was simple to mount on the house. I did add the micro SD card to record continuously. Records clear hi-res images. Configuration with the smartphone app was straight forward. I did have to experiment with the motion sensor field to reduce stray triggering. Since I installed the camera Wyze has added AI person detect which has helped the detection triggering a lot. I do find the IR range is limited and am considering a separate IR light source.,5,1,2019-8-17,1,0,0

"The coolest part about this camera is the magnetic base. The picture quality is fine and the night vision is alright. As far as the camera goes its solid. But the software and the app to use it just really could use some improvement. I was trying to record something from multiple angles so I wanted to use my phone and the camera but when I set the camera to record it stops once I close the app. There’s a feature on there to record off the app but it wasn’t working. I have other cameras that work just fine. This one not doing what I wanted it to do was very dissatisfying, also I wouldn’t trust it to record or capture important moments because it seems very hit or miss. If you just want a camera to monitor when you open the app to check on it and never record then by all means this is the way to go. Don’t recommend for recordings",3,1,2020-10-5,1,0,1
"Delivery was extremely slow, about 2 weeks.Cameras work reasonably well most of the time. Sometimes live feed just won't load, have to try later.",2,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
What can I say. It’s well worth the cost even though it isn’t perfect. It fits several specific needs around my home. The motion sensitivity setting should be adjustable live with the feed visible to let you adjust it to filter out movements that are to be considered noise. The night vision works fantastic but I wonder if we could adjust which IR LEDs are lit so we could experiment with just the right amount of IR light required for our specific needs. Lighting up an entire room naturally needs all. But a tupperware the size of an ice chest only needs maybe 1 or 2.,5,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0

"Great hardware and feature set for the price, but could never connect to them! I can’t tell you how much time I spent trying to make these cameras work because I really wanted them to! In the end I had to send them back since one of the basic functions (being able to connect to them when getting a motion alert) just failed every other time. I literally would connect, wait a minute, and try to reconnect and all the camera would say is reboot the camera. Even with smart plugs this isn’t a good option as sometimes rebooting did nothing either. I am shocked that these have such high reviews!",1,1,2018-11-30,1,2,0
"I have become obsessed with checking in on my dogs since I purchased this camera. The clarity is good no matter if its day or night. I did not get a micro sd card to use with it, but if you see something interesting happening on your phone, it's easy to record and save to your photo album. The only issue I have found is that the two-way audio does not sound great at all. My husband was downstairs and I was trying to tell him something. He said my voice sounded very robotic on his end, almost like the lady from poltergeist calling out to carolanne lol. For 25 bucks though, it does everything I really need it to do. I will get another to add to my nursery.",4,1,2018-10-17,1,2,0
"This camera falls under the premise, ""you get what you pay for"" ... I should have known better. Relatively easy to set up and sinc with your WiFi, but it freezes... the picture freezes which means you will miss a potential threat at your front/back door, or where ever you set the camera. I returned the camera a few days after it arrived and got my refund in a short period of time... the manufacturers need to go back to the drawing board on this one.",1,1,2019-3-17,1,2,0
"This camera was easy to set up, price is great and software is decent. It's perfectly suited as a baby monitor. I would not recommend it for security, like say, in a parking lot. The quality isn't good. I can't even read license plates from cars less than 10 feet away. Purchased a SIM card (Just not Wyze SIM, too expensive) is worth to be able to have playback and review. Great for motion detection as it notifies me each time. However bad quality and not very clear. Much better for up close and personal... like a baby cam.",3,1,2020-6-2,1,0,1
"I spent a stupid amount of time trying to get this camera to sync with the app.  The directions assume you are savvy with technology.  Even after watching a UTube video and reading the directions, it still wasn't clear.  All instructions leave out the most important part - you must have the lens of the camera and the bottom of the base of the camera together, so both are visible, when trying to sync.  Once this step is done, it is easy to operate.  Once camera is triggered, it won't retrigger for a certain (unknown) amount of time.  This can be a problem if you are trying to watch people coming in and out of your driveway.",4,1,2019-4-23,1,0,0
"I bought this webcam from traveling with the baby and am definitely impressed with this little camera.For $25 bucks, it gives me peace of mind when away from home. The quality is great, though I do think getting it to focus correctly takes a little finagling and adjusting. It also sometimes will get super dark and then I have to adjust it again to get it to focus on the baby and not the sides/walls. Great purchase and would definitely consider purchasing again or even to put around the house.",4,1,2020-7-31,1,0,1

The only thing I am not fond of..... when I want to talk to my dog, my voice comes across staticky. I can hear what's going on in the video, but they cannot hear me.  It is not clear.  Other than that, I love this product and have purchased 5.  Great little camera.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"I really want to like this camera and if I accept it for what it cost, I should. To me its great for keeping an eye on things when you're gone. If I was rating it for real security, it would get a zero. Bottom line is that it misses things a LOT. Its mounted outside under a big porch. It never has issues picking up the slightest leaf movement 75 feet away from a gentle breeze but in the last 2 days it has missed 5 huge Turkeys walking around in front of it 15 feet away in the middle of where its pointed and my neighbor pulling up 10 feet from it on a golf cart. Pretty sad. Again, if you are out of town and want to see if its raining at home, its great. Making sure if someone or something approached my house...its 50/50 at best",3,1,2020-8-7,1,1,0
"Have used this camera to make sure my child is actually staying in bed when he is supposed to. I have read the other reviews for this camera and because of the 3rd party software I do have him change in the closet where the camera cant see. The motion sensor on this is crazy, when the motion activated light outside turns on or off it will notify me, which at first was annoying but now it's a little peace of mind. The app is very easy to use and set up was easy as well. Have been thinking of getting a couple more for the house while we are on vacation so we can watch over our house while away. Very happy with this purchase.",5,1,2019-2-14,1,0,0
"I love this camera and have already ordered the pan and tilt version. Picture quality is remarkably good as is motion detection. The sound can be somewhat crackly/distorted, my only real complaint. I particularly like end to end encryption to the Amazon servers; if there’s a way to direct the video to my Amazon Drive account (as one can do with Amazon’s cloud camera) it will be even better. The set up and app are direct and intuitive. I hope they release an outdoor model soon, since one of mine is going on the covered porch where temperatures sometimes drop below 14 degrees F, below which indoor cameras might have problems operating properly.",5,1,2019-1-2,1,0,0

I bought these cameras nearly 6 months ago. I have 3 of these in my home and they rarely work when I need them. I have one in my 2 year old son’s room and the camera is currently “offline.”  I am unable to view my son while he is sleeping because the camera is often “offline.”  I’ve done all the troubleshooting steps multiple times and the camera works only intermittently.

"I bought this camera expecting a bad purchase because of the price but I was very impressed with its performance. The app is simple and easy to use, it sends you alerts if it senses motion or a person and you decide if you want both or just one.

So I guess it's not bad for it's value.Those who are saying it's not trusted or it records and who knows who will see your recording, simple thing is do not do anything that you don't want to see others, and by the way you are not going to put this in your bedroom, or who knows some people might.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0

I put a 64 gig Micro SD card I had laying around in it so I don't have to worry about not having video when I need it. The free 14 days of cloud storage is great too.

The only drawbacks are the lack of person recognition and I get a lot of false signals on the camera out front of my home.  It also loses connection with the network on occasion so I have to reset the devices.  They still need work but are a good item if you don't want to spend a small fortune on the top items.  Wyze is a small company and has a lot of growth to go, but I really like their products and have got a lot of value out of them.

The app is super easy to use, camera just plugged in and connected right away, and has been perfect for watching my newborn during naps up in another room.

If she chews or whines I can talk to her and she stops. Makes me feel at ease knowing she isn’t eating blankets or in distress. Only negative is it is hard to rewind (if you buy memory card). I can try to rewind 1 minute and it jumps and can never see what happens through out whole period. Wish I could fast forward etc. otherwise works great for what I need and for price.,5,1,2019-8-31,1,0,0
"Setup was easy and quick, that's the good point. I had the camera next to me running the app and moved the camera. DELAY! 10-15 seconds later the screen finally updated. Come to find out this is a known issue. If I want it anywhere near instant or live you need to change the settings to 360p instead of HD. Will be returning this camera.",2,1,2019-9-8,1,1,0
"After months of flawless operation, the last software update seems to have messed things up.  I have five of them and can't hook up to but one every time the app is open to open others have to close the app and then wait a while and open it again and repeat.  Support has been less than helpful.  This issue arose just this week and well what did I expect Chinese made and cheap in price you get what you pay for I guess!!!!  Finally had to lower the resolution to get them to work been running SD for 8 months had to go to 360.  Also one failed and they were good about replacing it, but it appears to have failed again.",3,1,2019-1-16,1,0,0
I have had this camera for almost a year with a 32GB flash card. I use it as a security camera pointed out my 2nd story window. The resolution is pretty good for 720p and the software - app works okay but once in a while when I view playbacks it will continuously disconnect from the camera. The app often has updates to the software and recently the Wyze server was hacked leaking user information. All customers were promptly contacted by Wyze and also by Amazon. That is good customer service that is appreciated. Very satisfied with this purchase.,5,1,2020-1-12,1,1,0
"Let me start by saying this was just my experience. I purchased one camera to give it a test and was pleased with it so ordered another for the shop and then another for the living room. To me the camera itself was not any better than any other inexpensive camera. What seemed to be above par was the software and app. Everything worked and was smooth to operate. Everything was fine and then, hear it comes, they all went offline. I tried a few things with my limited ability to no avail, so an email to service for help, no reply. After several hours waiting  I took the cameras down and went through the startup process again and wala job well done. They have been working good for a couple days now. My point is I’m still waiting for a response from my email from service. They probably would have instructed me to do what I did but that’s not the point.........no reply and no reason why they went offline.",4,1,2019-7-25,1,0,0

"For the price you can’t beat this. Picture quality is on point but the big disappointment here if the person/motion detection.  On the lowest possible setting it detects every single car and light that happens in the cameras range, but it is terrible at detecting human movement.

"I’ve had my camera for about a month, it’s basically useless . It sits 6’ from my router but still has trouble connecting to my WiFi. It loses connection and I have to re connect. So what good is a camera when you have no clue when it’s actually on!! I have and up to date router with 200 x 200 and I’m on a fiber optic network. I have rebooted it several time , updated the firmware but it still gets lost . I sent  an email to customer support with no reply .

"I really love this camera. Like many others, I had issues with the microSD not being recognized. I reached out to the company directly who sent me a new replacement that immediately accepted the microSD card. Great company to work with.

A lot of the improvements I think could be made in an update in the firmware. See below for pros and areas of improvement.Pros- affordable, much better value then the $200 Nest, above average sound quality and picture detail and great for $20.

Two of them are outside even though they are not outdoor rated. We hung them under the garage eves and out of the weather and they've worked for about 6 months. The downside is I've noticed spiders are attracted to the red leds at night and will build their nest there. Also, the motion detection seems to lag sometimes or cut off too quick, but for the price they really work well.",5,1,2019-9-8,1,0,0
They are inexpensive. Work good. Very easy to set up. Smaller than the competition. No holes required to mount. They come with everything needed to get started.

"I had trouble setting up a WYZE account and originally gave a bad review. Let me tell you I tested the durability of this camera at this time and I am impressed it still works.  My daughter showed what I was doing wrong and almost all is good now. It was easy to set up the camera when I saw what I was doing wrong. First, video is very good. Features, are very good. For a $30 camera I can't imagine getting a better one. My only problem with this system is I was looking for a camera that would alert my phone when there was motion detected. I was under the impression this camera would do that and I don't see how to do this with software provided.",4,1,2019-3-13,1,0,0

I was already having issues with the the internet, and had to unplug the cam as the tv was going out. I bought a new wireless router and it works great....no more internet cutting out. So I try to hook the cam up again......that was a performance because had to change passwords. Now it says it is not supporting 5gh wifi. So I email tech support, which takes several days (I still have not heard back), but looking on another board, I see I will never be able to use this cam with this wifi router. So i have wasted my time and money.",1,1,2019-2-22,1,0,0
"I bought this camera so I could record motion-sensed activities in my parent's apartment. I bought it after reading articles on the product's support site and some of the reviews/questions here.  My (very old) parent does not have internet or wifi so I had to (at home) configure the camera, make sure it works, and then take it to my parent's place.  It's supposed to work as configured but what I found out was things don't work as expected when you unplug the camera and plug it in elsewhere.  The camera loses all its configs and will not record. The product's support people confirmed that this is a bug.I returned the product.",3,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0
Night vision doesn’t work and I get way too many notifications and they are ALWAYS false alarms. You know what they say about the boy who cried wolf? Pretty much the same case.

"Well, there's three hours of my life I can't get back. Setup is not as easy as they claim. First off, they don't tell you that your router must be a 2.4ghz ONLY router. So, I bought a new router. Didn't fix the problem. Went into their troubleshooting section on their website and followed the directions, still NO CONNECTION. What a POS. my D-link was as simple as opening the box, pressing the WPS on the devices and then waiting for a blue light. I guess I'm going to return this square pile of garbage and go d-link.

"I really enjoyed these cameras initially and the video quality for the cost was awesome. However, they are adding on extra fees per camera at a time when I continue to have “glitches”. Either a camera will be off when I attempt to check it remotely and will require reconnection in person or this new one with “fragments” and not recording content. I’ve been attempting to rectify the issue with support for the past 45 minutes but there isn’t actually support. Just lots of automatic messages that aren’t even on topic and I’m never connected to actual tech-support even though someone is supposed to be available according to hours posted.

"So it's taken me a while to get around to writing a review for this camera (Wyze cam 1080p HD) but I wanted to make sure I did it eventually... So this camera was everything I could have asked for and more, the picture and simplicity of setup were everything and more especially for the price.In fact I was going to buy 2 or 3 more but about a month in to use (total use was very minimal too, only being on for 3-5 minutes at a time maybe once or twice a day, so I think I might have got a bad product who knows) but it was working one night then I moved it and it prompted me to restart the camera and now it just doesn't connect to wifi and I've tried everything to get it to connect but no to avail.",4,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"Wyze cam is probably the best camera you can get for your home surveillance at this price point! I personally have 5 of these cams positioned throughout my house. Mounting is fairly simple enough and can just sit on flat surfaces if you don't want to mount it. It's just as simple as plugging it in and connecting it to the app. The quality of the image is fairly good, enough to get the job done. Motion detection works pretty well, though it will pick up a bug flying by or a car driving past on the road if you have the detection box set that large. There is also 2 way microphone and audio, so you can talk to whoever is on your camera through the app and they can talk to you! I highly recommend this for anyone that wants to have home surveillance but do not want to break the bank.",5,1,2020-10-5,1,0,1
I triple-checked all of the settings on the app and went through the Troubleshooting section.  No cloud recordings were ever made.

I tried inserting two different SD Micro cards (sold separately!) and BOTH times the camera did NOT recognize that an SD card was installed. Two different trips to Walmart to first buy the SD card, then return.  But, I'm going to give them one more chance because it's a promising device and an excellent price.",3,1,2017-12-4,1,2,0

"We love this tiny camera. We wanted something to keep any eye on the pets when we arent here and the ability to see if our son gets up after bedtime. It was a very easy set up, nice picture, good sound for the 2 way sound. Has a tiny bit of lag but that's not a big issue. The night mode is really cool, very clear. I love that we can put an ad card in it to store or that we have the option to hit record if we are watching from our phone. It's also pretty neat to be able to say something to the kids from my room in the livingroom without screaming accross the house! This was totally worth the money and they have other products that are reasonably priced that help run the home more efficiently! How cool!

"My hopes weren't real high for these cameras upon seeing the price.  However, I currently have 2 version 2's and they have had nothing but issues since I installed them over the past couple days.  The main issue I am having is the cameras keep going offline according to the app on my android phone.  The app will show they are just randomly offline on the app's overview screen, but when you actually click on the camera it is in fact online, not offline.  The issue with this is they do not record events during this time and Alexa cannot control them.  The weird thing is the continuous recording still captures everything.  So you can rewind back on the continuous recording off of the micro SD card and see everything during this, ""Offline"", period.  You can even see the little green boxes capturing and outlining motion on the screen, but it does not record it as an event and no notification is ever sent.  Apparently many others have had this issue as well.  I hope this is an issue that can be fixed via software or firmware updates.  As of now I cannot recommend these cameras as they are not reliable, but what do you expect for $25.",2,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0

I was wanting a camera that connected to my phone so I can see it if I am not home and she is with a sitter I can still check on her. So this is super convenient!

I realize ipads aren't meant to be monitors but I have some older ones and they are great for that purpose. That being said - Wyze units and app make this all possible. And an added plus is there's a wyze app for amazon fire stick.

It gives you the option for motion detection and notifications. You can set specific times for notifications and it stores any events for a 24 hour period.

"Don't be fooled by its low price; this is a great camera. You can buy a weatherproof case for the camera and install it outdoor. We have five cameras installed outdoor around the front and back yards, and none had failed in the past 2 1/2 years. It is not expensive to replace if one fails. We stopped buying the Nest camera after one failed. The Wyze apps is excellent too. It does not have many features as the Nest apps, but it is quicker to launch and view the cameras.

Bought one of these cameras not expecting much but what a surprise. I place it in my front window facing the walk way to my house and it works great. You may have to work with the detection zone a little to get it just right but once you dial it in it works pretty goods even through the window. I do get some false notification but that is normally due to reflections on the window. Sends me a notification every time someone comes near my front door.This is an indoor camera and it must be plugged in to work.

Was a little skeptical because the price was so great but after reading other reviews I decided to buy two of the cameras.

Other companies are selling similar products for so much more and here you have this awesome company giving you the same thing at such an affordable and reasonable price! I applaud the owners for stepping out and starting such an amazing company that really cares about quality and customers.

Great price! Great camera! I purchased this camera with a 25% discount i would have paid drug price. It works great. This camera has voice and works so good. My kids keep telling me it's not a toy. I only bought it because I shop too much on Amazon and I receive a lot of packages. The only downside is that it doesn't rotate 360°. I will invest in the rotating camera.

I have owned a Wyse Cam v1 before and it lasted about a year before failing. So I decided to buy another. The first order I could not get a 32GB Wyse SD card to be recognized on the camera. I tried reformats of the card and even downloaded the SD Card Association utility to format the card with no luck. I also tired a new Sandisk 32GB SD card same issue. Tried to open a ticket with Wyze and it took two days before they got back to me. By then I already open a amazon return for an exchange. The second Wyze had the same issue. A internet search in Wyze community indicates this is a common problem that has been happen for a while with no resolution other than camera replacement.  I done with Wyze there are other options at a slight higher price.,1,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
We used this at our kiosk in the mall to keep an eye on things and it worked great.  Good picture and the two way talk feature came in very useful.  There is a bit of a delay and the sound quality is not great but it worked enough to ask our employees to check a message on their phone.

The only reason I would consider a different camera is for security sake as this is based on the Xiaomi camera hardware and firmware which has a history of exfiltrating data to China. Just use it for an outside camera or a fishtanks cam and who cares.In this case, if your potential privacy innovation (not saying it is, just not saying it isn't) is worth $100, then this camera is for you as it is easily $100 less than any comparable product.",5,1,2019-1-6,1,0,0
"We use this to monitor someone who is ill. The video quality is excellent. When it is dark, it changes to black and white and back again to color with enough light. When it comes to voice communication, it is very poor. We can’t speak back and forth as I had hoped. I can hear noises/sounds which is somewhat helpful. I can hear sneezing and coughing and the sound from the TV. Speech is too garbled to understand reasonably. It has saved me many trips to check on things, so the price is certainly right for that.",4,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"Perfect! I’m just waiting for them to release an outdoor version! That being said, this camera delivered on its promises, and then some! I’ve been using two of them for a few months now and haven’t had a single issue with either of them! Night vision works perfectly, in HD quality as advertised. Motion AND sound detection work almost too well, but you have the ability to adjust sensitivity for both; you’re also able to select a specific area in the cameras field of view for the motion detection to work within— helpful if you want to keep a watchful eye on say- your front yard, but don’t want to receive a notification for every car that passes by. It goes above and beyond just the motion detection with person detection. Two weeks rolling storage of 12 second clips, for FREE— I can’t understand why anybody would ever choose another camera option, especially for the price, it can’t be beat! Wyze far exceeded my expectations, I’m a very happy, very satisfied buyer and I WILL be purchasing more of their products; both cameras and other gadgets!",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"The Wyze can is an excellent value in terms of what you get for what you paid. It is extremely easy to set up and you're on your way quite quickly. Also the built-in magnetic base along with the metal plate they provide makes mounting the camera effortless and requires no tools. The picture quality during the day is actually quite impressive. The only complaints are the night vision isn't the greatest and motion detection is very basic. However, you have to remember that for the relatively low price, you can't expect the top performance.",4,1,2019-7-14,1,1,0
So i received the item as stated and it is the perfect size but unfortunately it is only comparable with 2.4 internet and i guess i have 5 which i would imagine anyone these days has. so i am unable to connect and even  use the item so i can not review if it works at all. The set up was a bit of a pain that i tried to do 5 times and wasted 2 hours to find out that i can not use this.Please check your wifi bfr purchasing this to make sure you can use it and not waste the time and money.,3,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0

Night mode does not work very well - that being said, I have fairly dark floors and my dog is also gray so he blends in. Just have to leave on a light nearby.

I've found it perfect - not only for the original purpose but also for the joyfully cute little clips I've seen of what my dog does in my room when I'm either outside or in another part of the house (it's adorable!!!!).  Takes a little time to get the sensitivity settings just right (still working on it) but I'm already happy...the price is UNBELIEVABLE as far as for what you get for the money and it's the easiest camera system I've ever installed from start to finish.

I love this camera. I live in apartments where packages go missing so love I can see everything. Only thing I don’t like is the motion detection. I gave that part a 3 because it will send me notifications every 5 seconds on shadows from anything. So that is very annoying. If they fixed it to where it would only detect what really matters like people. It would be perfect. But wanna make sure you buy the longer cord the one that comes with it doesn’t reach that far.

I wanted to know immediately when someone pulled into my driveway which I cannot see from inside the house. Did not work at all for my purpose.

Camera's led showed it was connected, it showed on my router as an active device, I could ping the camera, but not connect to it.

Customer support told me that I was out of the warranty period and that nothing more could be done. The bottom line is that Wyze products are pretty much hit & miss. The quality just isn't there on a consistent basis. If you do decide to buy from them, my advice is to lower your expectations a notch or two (three really) and to test every single feature extensively (even those you might not need from the onset) before the warranty period runs out.

So now I’m building up. I bought this one just to see motion and turn a light on. WOW, it does that great and so much more. It works with it’s own software Wyze which lets you record pictures or video in low, standard, high definition. My wife loves it because I go downstairs at night and the lights come on for me, and as I’m getting something out of the fridge for a snack she can talk down through it and ask me to bring a sandwhich up, and I can ask what she want’s on it. It’s just great. At night time you can see in monochrome great. I mean guys, it’s under $25 when I bought it, and it works much better maybe twice as better as old cameras and it’s less than half the cost. Way to go Wyze!

The night vision is really good, I put it in a pitch dark room and it literally looks like there’s a light in the room, it’s pretty amazing considering the price, for the price it’s by far one of the best cameras you can get and it’s worth it because I simply use it to check on when the kids get home from school and it serves its purpose so I changed by 2 star to 5 star because there’s really nothing negative I can say about it.",5,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0

Haven't tried the new person detection, but it's exciting that Wyze adds new features like this to existing hardware.App leaves a bit to be desired from a UX perspective, but really I don't ever use the app unless I get a motion triggered alert.

I’ve had issues with the maintenance team for my apartment complex coming in and stealing or coming in when I don’t put in an order. This camera initially worked great out the box. The notifications you can set up were great. However, my main issues with this camera are that it doesn’t consistently send notifications when someone else enters your apartment. I’ve had days and weeks were maintenance people come in and the camera doesn’t send me anything, but it will let me know that light from outside is shifting through my blinds. The other main issue is that it consistently loses connection with my internet service and I either have to reset the camera, another major headache, or I have to reset my router. The customer service for this company is also poor because they approach every problem with “have you reset it” or “just keep trying and it’ll begin to work properly”. I’m gonna have to try another camera. This one isn’t worth the trouble.

You will not go wrong with these cameras and the app. We even bought a Echo Show 5 and these little cameras work great with that system as well.They are small, pleasant to look at, and have great picture quality.

"The image quality is great. I like that you can change the angle of what you’re viewing. Problem is can’t rarely connect when away from home. I can connect without issues while at home, but when away the camera can rarely be reached. Extremely frustrating as it defeats the purpose of the camera. I will also point out I had another set of cameras, very poor night image, but very rarely did I have issues connecting to it. That is disappointing. I’m giving this one one less star because it doesn’t move like the other camera does. I do love it’s small size, but do wish it was also able to rotate.",2,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
"I have an older version of this camera that works perfectly.  However, this one won't see the home wifi network, despite following all instructions and even trying a different router and setup.  Maybe the one I received was broken, or maybe (as users online have suggested) you can it to work by downgrading the firmware, setting it up, and then upgrading it again.  But I'm tired of spending 4+ hours troubleshooting something I just bought, so back it goes.For what it's worth, the working Wyze Cam I already have is excellent.",2,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0
"This is extremely easy to set up, comes with magnetic base mounts and the camera extends out from the base to angle it where you want. The quality even on standard definition is very great! You can speak through the cameras microphone from the Wyze app on your phone, set up for motion detection to trigger video recording alerts sent directly to your phone and so much more!The app is very user friendly and has tons of features all controlled from your phone.",5,1,2019-3-18,1,0,0
"Price wise, these are obviously ""cheap"" for a camera of this size and functionality; however, it was the best $20ish I've spent in awhile. Obviously the camera quality isn't the greatest, but for the price tag it is outstanding! I had a smoke detector alarm gp off in my house, and both of our cameras immediately sent a notification to my phone indicating it sounded like a smoke detector going off! I didn't even know that was a feature! Night vision is so-so, it just depends on where you place your camera and how close certain objects are.",5,1,2019-5-26,1,0,0
"Honestly, for the price... this camera is amazing and everything we needed. I got it to keep an eye on my anxious pup when I went to work and it gave me so much peace of mind. The picture quality is surprisingly good and the night vision is too. Motion capture is super sensitive, even picks uptight shifts and cars outside my window. Very happy with this camera 1+ years later.",5,1,2020-8-11,1,2,0
Work well during the day. The sound is a little blurry but the camera is very inexpensive and easy to install. Love it. Several of my friends bought them and are very satisfied. I have four and may get more.  Hard to see at night especially if there is a light that blurs the picture. Great during the day when the sun does not hit it directly.  A bit difficult to get  the camera online if you are not too tech savvy but I managed.  Great for the price.  I did get the brackets for outdoor use.,5,1,2019-9-28,1,0,0
"I got this camera so I could be able to check up on my cat, and also as an added security feature to my apartment. The camera alone has an outstanding high quality view through the mobile application, and it’s also simple to use.There’s people that might be intimidated that people from China might be hacking into the camera, and spying on you but so what!? At the end of the day we aren’t Beyoncé, or some type of celebrity to be hiding from the public. All cameras are vulnerable to possible hacking, doesn’t matter how boujie it can be. If they hacked into Hillary Clinton’s emails, what makes you think someone might not hack into yours lol.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,1
"This is the best damn camera for 25 bucks I’ve seen. Full of features and worth every bit of 50 - 100. The software is great allowing you to choose just a small monitoring zone and it’s not overly sensitive. Super easy to setup by taking a photo of a RC code. Love it, I will be buying more of these.",5,1,2020-7-17,1,1,0
"I bought several of them and I am very satisfied with the results. I had CCD cameras with the great DVR equipment and the truth is that I will not use them anymore. The Wyze cameras are very small and easy to use, in addition to all the functions that for the price no camera will give you results that Wyze does give you. It is important to put a 32GB micro SD memory to use continuous recording.I recommend them for use at home and for the office. I hope Wyze develops the software so I can see the images on the computer.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
Got this camera and couldn’t get it to connect to WiFi. I work at a internet company so I knew My internet was working but it kept saying couldn’t find network name. Tried calling support and waited an HOUR and never got connected. Tired to connect with support and still couldn’t get through. I ended up returning and buying a more expensive camera that worked right out of the box I was so passed I almost threw it out the damn window,1,1,2019-10-30,1,1,0
"So my partner and I only have one question: who else can see us?This product and night view, quality etc for 20 bucks, it is SUSPICIOUSLY and crazy cheap. In fact it is so cheap that you wonder what they actually profit of. Who else can watch you when its on and CONNECTED to the world wide web? Because the company would get way more money for your home movie than for the camera.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0
"Cloud record is too short and the cooldown time is too long.....one of these things should be changed. No you can achieve longer recording through the use of an sd card but the problem that has arisen for me is that of the two cams that I purchased, none of them seem to recognize any sd card but the same sd card worked in the Wyze Cam Pan. So for that I have to lower my rating. Wish they had a way to view the clips besides JUST the app but I grew to tolerate that. Other than that, videos are great, the delay when watching videos is rather short, and the 2 way talk feature works fairly well.",3,1,2019-4-9,1,0,0
Not overly impressed with this camera.  Camera picture is great.  The app though is horrible.  Keeps removing settings and notifications are sporadic.  Most of the video clips won’t open.  Not what I was looking for in a home camera.  It’s useless if it won’t record.  Might as well have a regular baby monitor.  Won’t be buying any more of these.Update:  someone went thru my car last night and this piece of crap camera didn’t pick up anything.  Throwing this away I’m so disgusted with it!!!  Do not buy!!!!!!!!,1,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0
"Just plain frustrating. It worked at first with the SD card, but someone moved it and it recorded things I didn't want to record, so I tried to erase it and it didn't work, then I tried to reformat the SD card and it wouldn't work, then I removed the SD card and put it back in, thinking it was just a glitch, but no, the camera kept saying NO SD CARD INSTALLED, and I don't have time for this. This is the second camera and SD card I have tried, and I am done with it. I would like to return it, but my return window is past.",1,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0
"This is a pretty good camera with great quality in video for the price, but it does miss some detection with motion and night vision is a bit blurry. Worst flaw is that it only features 12 seconds of video footage per event. Not long enough to capture anything unless you use the playback feature with an addition of an SD card, but using this feature is extremely time-consuming. Clip times definitely need to be extended to at least 30 seconds like most other security cameras, and there are no subscriptions required for them. Wyze failed in this particular area & they need to correct this!",3,1,2019-8-9,1,0,0
"I bought this on  Black Friday, it was bundled with my Alexa Show 8, it was supposed to be able to be viewed on my show eight, but it doesn’t. I worked with the Wyze support technicians on 3 separate occasions for around an hour each time,they finally asked me to send them the log from the Wyze app which I did in the beginning of January.. I haven’t heard a word from them,  so if you think this is something that you would like to try, be prepared to send it back,",1,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"A really good cam especially at the price. Most of these smaller cam companies don't last very long. But so far so good. Also no fee cloud storage is a plus. The price of the cam plus shipping is the exact amount as prime with ""free"" shipping. I don't know what's up with that. I guess you'll get it faster through prime as wyze states 4 to 7 days. I highly reccomend this camera to anyone working with a budget and needs a video security system. The cams can be daisy chained issuing one power supply. They are very efficient cameras. Also resilient my kids have pulled them down to the floor and haven't broken them yet..",5,1,2019-3-12,1,0,0
Great picture and I can hear on it very well. The sound and motion sensors are very sensitive. I get the push notifications quickly. It really works well.Update: I just added another cam and put it in a case for the driveway. It hooked right up to the app with no problems. Started getting notifications right off. Just wish it took better videos in the shaded areas. In the sunny ares it’s great. It’s a great little camera and I’ll probably add another one too. And it’s working well all the way across the house and outside as far Away from the WiFi as you can get. My tests show about 20 Mbps out there and the cam does great on HD. The pic I added is with 20 Mbps on the HD setting.,5,1,2018-12-26,1,0,1
"This is a great security camera for most people.  Everything is thought out and makes sense. The camera gives the best of both worlds with both local storage and some cloud storage.  If the camera is ripped off you still have a clip of the action in the cloud.  No monthly service fee for a good small bit of storage.  For more storage and for most cases the local SD card is great.  Motion detection, sound detection, smoke alarm detection.  One zone motion detection perfect. The android app is amazing. You can tell there is a lot of hard work put into fixing androids os weirdness.  It is the best it can be.  Group viewing of cameras. Short cut grouping of actions like on/off cameras, on/off notifications. Sound recording.  Intercom.  Ability to record spinets of video easily.  Two factor verification on login if you want.  Perfect !! Time lapse, wow!!  The reason this camera is so good is it is at a reasonable price to buy many and many of these around your place and not feel like you are much more poorer for having some security.  Thank you Wyze for all of your hard work!!",5,1,2019-5-9,1,0,0
"I enabled RTSP and connected the camera to Home Assistant. This feature alone makes this product very worth its value because it's officially supported and updated. I could've went with even cheaper Chinese ip camera but the support team at Wyze seem like they care about users (saw their reddit posts). A camera to record package deliveries is all I need for now, but if I ever feel the need to buy more cameras, I would definitely buy more Wyze cam.",5,1,2020-9-17,1,0,1
LOVE this camera for a baby monitor. You won’t beat the price for this item. I read reviews about hacking concerns and my opinion on that is if someone wants to hack into my camera and watch my child sleep have at it. Not an issue for me. Planning to buy a few more for the house. It is annoying that when unplugging the camera and plugging it back in you have to re learn it back onto the Wyze app. Not a big deal though. Total time to set up once plugged in is 30-60 seconds max. Alerts me if any sound or motion is picked up. We used when we traveled internationally as well as stateside. Great product.,5,1,2018-12-9,1,0,0
"This feature-rich little camera does pretty much anything you'd want to do with a $250 camera. It also works with IFTTT, which I've tested it as a ""trigger"".

"Can't say how good or bad the camera actually is since I was not able to set it up using the Wyze app. Problems began when I tried to register a new account on the app. Although the camera runs on 2G wireless, the app runs on cellular data. Once I turned off the phone's WIFI I was able to set up an account. Followed the instructions for camera setup but app stalled when it asked me to scan the QR code on the camera. I couldn't, and the ""click for help"" just brought up a blank screen.  Reached out to company's tech support and was advised they would respond in 7 days. I gave up and returned the camera to Amazon.",1,1,2019-1-21,1,1,0
"The real downside to these devices is after they detect motion and record the 12 second video, there is a 5 minute ""cool down"" period before they will detect any further motion and upload another video to the cloud. There is no way to change this, or even pay for it to be removed. This negates these devices as professional security devices. You can put your own local SD card in to record all the time, but if the camera is stolen, your footage goes with it. The other major downside is the app is the only way to view the footage, there is no desktop application.",4,1,2019-4-21,1,0,0
"I have been researching indoor security and baby monitors for the past 3 months! (bored future dad here) With that, I can say this is by far the most incredibly feature packed camera with ZERO attachments to a paid subscription service. I really like the fact that I can put this camera anywhere in the house (and even outside with that bird house accessory) and record motion alerts.  It's great for dogs, humans, babies, or whatever you are trying to monitor.I shared access with my wife and she can check up on the baby from work.

This is a great little camera for the money. The night vision isn't great unless you have it for indoor use or use it outside for outside use because if you have it in a window trained on an outside area the night vision just creates a glare on the window. I love that I can watch it from my smart phone or tablet and I can go back and look at what it has recorded very easily.  I am going to buy more of these now that I know how good they are! Hooks up to Alexa and Fire TV too!,5,1,2019-5-15,1,1,0
"Nice little camera to make sure my garage door is closed.  Not much use for security, capture footage is pretty much useless too slow can barely recognize myself let alone someone breaking in.  Also if someone did break in they would be long gone before I get notification. Sometimes 20 minutes later.

After 10 minutes, the stream stops and you have to again ask Alexa to show the Wyze Camera stream. So, this is not the right camera for a nursery.",1,1,2019-12-10,1,1,0
"So. I purchased this with the best intentions: a little extra security for inside my house. I bought the camera. Installed it. Happy customer. For the price, I couldn’t complain about the quality of the camera either. However, I went back to the reviews to see what others had to say after purchasing, and they claimed that these cameras are wired to automatically turn your camera on when you’ve set it to off: this has not happened to me, but I started thinking long and hard, and after seeing reviews claiming the Chinese are spying on you through the camera, I said forget it. I’m returning it first thing tomorrow.Needless to say, I’m sticking to my Ring camera",2,1,2019-4-22,1,0,0
Holy cow. I use this as a baby monitor. It’s better than our $165 monitor. Clear picture. Can look at it from an app on my phone. Mounted on the wall and can see everything I need to.

"I am using this device in my garage. It has worked very well for me, as I keep the garage door open during the day for access. The device detects motion and sound which is a plus for me.

Their night vision is astonishing, and I am even able to zoom in on my child's chest and can tell if my baby is still breathing - such amazing picture quality!  They are SO EASY to set up - takes like five minutes and even an idiot (like me) figured it out easily.  I think these are a must buy for any camera needs.",5,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0

I have a few of these cameras and they work extremely well.  So easy to set up and the app is super easy to use.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking to put security cameras in.  I have only put them inside but have friends who have them outside for over a year and under a soffit (so out of the elements but outside without a protective cover) and continue to work well.

I bought one of the indoor IP cameras listed for ~$45 on here and it was a hunk of junk. Wouldn’t stay connected to WiFi at all. Returned it and bought this one and it is AMAZING. I cannot believe this camera is less than $30. Setup took 30 seconds and the picture is crystal clear. This camera has a ton of features as well and there is no monthly fee for cloud storage.

After a ton of research i ended up ordering this camera and i was actually shocked at how well it picked up picture, detected sound and motion and how good quality the night vision was! It’s helped give me a peace of mind during my long days at work. It also helps ease my dog’s anxiety because i can talk to her through the camera and listen in on her anytime of the day! Sound and motion detection notifications go straight to your phone through the free mobile app. It’s all around a great camera if you aren’t wanting to break your bank!",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,1
"Many negative reviews speculate that this camera allows people from China to view whatever the camera sees. I see no reason to believe that, but I know that it doesn't matter for my purposes (keeping watch long-distance over my foster kittens and their mom).I do know that this camera took me less than 10 minutes to set up and connect. Re-connection is sometimes necessary but is just as easy (as long as my internet is running correctly). The image is excellent, including night vision.

For $20 a pop, it's worth it! I would be careful about having these cameras inside your home though. Call it a hunch, but I always feel like its on even when it's not.

Awesome. I purchased this to set at my front window to monitor my porch area and it does just that. I love being able to watch the live stream anytime and the option to record with an sd card. My camera is right up against the window and I did have to try different angles at night due to the reflection. I found that it worked better to leave the night vision off at night since I have a porch light on and that helped tremendously with the glare. Hope that helps!,5,1,2019-10-19,1,1,0

I had a very difficult time with set up. You need a certain WiFi to connect. Had to call my internet provider. Concept of this camera great. Price unbelievable. Once set up very early to use. I recommend getting the WiFi thing figured out before trying to set up . Otherwise great product for the price. This will only connect to 2.4gtz not 5.

It's pretty simple but it does require an additional wire (USB A - USB A or a micro USB adapter) and a micro SD card.  Beware that because it's meant to be a security camera, it has a wide lens view and a bit of fish lens effect.  However, since all the normal webcams are either sold out or being price-gouged, for $25, this is a great alternative.",4,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
very impressed at how this little camera functions.  the night vision is amazing and the 2 way audio is clear and crisp. we got this to watch our puppy and it was the best purchase we have made for this type of item.  we raved about it so much that 3 other family members purchased one for their home and we also got another one as a Christmas gift this year for our upstairs.

Call me frugal.I ordered her the Waze Cam for her birthday and I have been amazed with the product ever since. Not only is the picture and sound quality better than our expensive home security system, but the functions it offers are nothing short of amazing.

"I have used countless cameras/baby monitors in my daughters bedroom ever since she was born. In total, we’ve probably spent hundreds on all different brands and models, each one having bad signals, trouble staying connected, always “out of range” (even though we’re one room over), or terrible night vision. I’ve probably purchased a handful that cost between $120-$300 each for them to all end up back in the box collecting dust. That is until I found this one. This camera is perfection! For $20-$25 I am AMAZED at its quality. I’ll admit I was a little skeptical at first considering the price but the night vision is crystal clear, the motion sensor picks up everything, and I never have an issue with the connection. I purchased this with an Alexa show so I could always have access to viewing from bed, without needing my phone and I couldn’t be happier. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality camera for any reason and I will be purchasing more Wyze products for around the house.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,1
"Their app for streaming live footage is just unreliable. I have it on the lowest video quality with sound off and it is slow to connect, and video is choppy. Sometimes it works well,. Maybe it has to do with their network, My internet speeds are exceptional so it's definitely not that. These cameras don't really function well for what they're meant to. Will look for another brand that is more reliable. I guess that is why they are so cheap.",1,1,2020-9-28,1,0,0
"I bought this instead of a baby monitor mainly because of the price and because I could access it on my phone. I am super impressed. The video quality is excellent day and night, the camera could not have been easier to set up, and the app is easy to use. Way better than any of the other (much pricier) baby monitors I've used over the span of 3 kids and 7 years. My only criticism is that the app sometimes takes awhile to load which can be frustrating when you need to check in quickly. Otherwise I'm very happy and am considering buying additional cameras.",5,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0
"I am impressed by this camera. Sure, the $25 price may throw people off and make it seem like it’s cheap. But believe me, this camera is worth every cent. I bought one with a gift card since I had been eyeing this item for a while. I placed it in my room just because. The night vision works, I’m able to talk using the app, it records motion and send notifications. What more could you ask? My only complaint the sound sometimes sounds like there is some interference and the night vision can sometime click on and off continuously.",5,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0
"I had three of the V1 Wyze Cam devices in my house, but wanted the Alexa functionality.  After getting this, they even added Google Home support, and the service is free to use.

Easy set up. I still haven't figured out how to work the camera to start recording automatically when someone comes to the door and to notify me when someone is at the door. Last night the UPS man drop off a package and I didn't know the package was there until I happen to open the door and see it because the UPS man didn't ring the doorbell.,4,1,2019-12-8,1,1,1
"I bought few for our home, so we could watch the dogs, and we loved these camera so much we got another one for out side and one more for the RV. So the one from the out side saved us from a hit and run. We were home the driver tried to run and then tried to say it wasn’t her, but camera doesn’t lie. One negative is that it doesn’t record for enough time, and once it spotted a movement it doesn’t continue recording until the movement stops. That would be the only thing I would change. Quality is great for the price, I did have to reset them few time but it’s because our internet line went down.I think this is a great purchase we are extremely happy.",5,1,2019-6-5,1,0,1
I ordered one Wyze camera to use as a basic security cam for my house while I'm away working remote.  I did read the reviews on the camera and saw allot of concern about privacy. I only use it to monitor my house when I'm away and have no issue with the camera recording me while I am home. The camera was easy to set up and was put in a central location inside my home. I've had it in use for a couple weeks and everything has been great so far. You can't beat the initial $25 spent for ease of use and quality of video.,5,1,2019-6-14,1,0,0
"It's good but too fragile.  I returned one because SD card issue.  I am thinking about return another one because after power outage, it stopped working as it never read QRCode again, meaning never connected again.When using SD card Wyze Cam V2 stopped working.  I tried to troubleshoot with support a bit but did not help so, I gave up. I just had power outage recently.  I submitted support through Wyze website last week and after a week, no one helped me. I consider to return this one as well.  I had used the 2nd one from Nov 2018 to May 2019, during the time of use, I had to reboot the cam from time to time because images colors started to mess up or sometimes, having 2 frames of images overlapping with each other.

I’m probably gonna but more!",5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,1
"At first it was a great deal, buy and add a sim card and I was able to set my recordings up. Now Wyze has a paid service, which sucks because you can only get 12 seconds of recordings.

The camera cannot be uses effectively for remote monitoring.  Otherwise it is a good quality camera.",2,1,2019-9-17,1,1,0
"For what this thing cost, it's quite an impressive little camera.Setup is easy, picture quality is decent.

I’m shocked. Back in my day this technology would be three times more expensive maybe more! The ease of setup was refreshing and perfect! The camera also has a quick wall mount option and requires no tools. I did have to buy a usb extender to allow the one camera to reach further to the wall outlet. Operates off of the 2.4ghz bandwidth. You can still use your phone on the 5ghz to watch too. I appreciate that the lens also is wide angle. I nearly can capture my entire living room and dining area. I bought two more.,5,1,2019-6-16,1,0,0
"Had a break in recently in my neighborhood not too far from my house. We never have issues so this shocked us. I was scrolling and reading reviews on cameras, I ordered two of these little babies and placed them on two of my window sills, one in front, one on the side. Came home from work to find the wife’s car had been broken into, I called the cops, and we used my footage to catch the perps, turned out to be local kids. I was blown away at the quality for such a cheap camera, I am planning to order 3 more for the house. If you’re looking for an alternative to drilling holes for a outdoor camera, I would highly suggest Wyze. Always lock your doors and garages, and get a 64gb or 128gb sd card for your Cams, you’ll thank me later.",5,1,2019-8-12,1,0,0
"Love, love, love, love!!! Well I’ll begin saying I have never had a camera in my home, so I can’t say I compare it to much, yet I have seen cameras in other places and this one is just better all around! Great imaging (I imagine if you have realistic expectations) night vision is creepingly good! If a demon decides to check out my kids, not only will I have a great, clear image to remember him by, but I will be able to clearly hear his threats.. but fear not, the camera has a great feature were you can clearly tell the attacker to please clear the premises without putting yourself in danger! Actually the speaking feature is so good that my kid calls the camera “mama” because he thinks I live in it when I leave!",5,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0
I would love to start out with saying this is a 25$ camera.. past experience has always told me that a 25$ camera is going to be crap.. this just isnt the case with this camera at all.. set up was a bit of a pain as I had to factory reset the device out of the box.. but this company has a youtube channel the gos over all that 10/10 user experience there.. the night vision is actually vary good.. now the 2 way talk acts a little funny as it repeats itself in an endless loop which isnt good... idk why mine is doing that but whatever.. what I want to know is how they are selling somthing like this at such an absurd low cost and it pack this much of a punch in today's market.. ps: you can power these with a battery bank which I'll be trial running tonight and seeing how long it can run on one.. Wyze if you read this review I'd love to see you guys put out a power bank made for this camera.. so I can lose the cords in locations were cords just dont work,5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"Great value for the price. I have 3 up and running. When I first set up the camera, it had a hard time scanning the code, but I finally figured since I used my iPad I had to position it a bit farther away. It was really pretty easy. Once operational, one of the three seemed to be out a lot, but then would work again. My cats trigger the alerts, so I had to set my phone to silent mode at night. And i finally installed micro SD cards on all, but I need to watch some tutorials on YouTube to really see what I can do with them. I like the Facebook weekly updates, too. I’m looking forward to getting the v2 cam, and really can’t wait till they have an outside model! TIP- buy a longer power cord along with your cam unless you have an outlet close to where you want the cam.",5,1,2018-3-8,1,0,0
Wonderful customer service from start to finish with Wyze. I had an issue where notifications were not being sent to my devices. I called customer service and the rep provided a solution. She advised trying to manually install the latest firmware using a micro SD card. Issue was resolved and another rep followed up just to make sure everything was working properly. I can't speak highly enough for the two Representatives that handled my issues. I own a computer sales & service company and we regularly install camera systems for clients. I will definitely be recommending Wyze for not only security solutions but for pet cameras as well. Excellent quality at an affordable price!,5,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0

I wanted to like this camera but it wouldn't stay connected to my internet. The router was only maybe 15 feet away with an unobstructed line of sight. Other wireless devices in the same room work flawlessly.  When it did stay connected it did seem to work well. I ended up returning it. Others on YouTube give it great reviews which influenced my purchase. Sadly it did not work for me. I'll stick with my Yi camera that has been working great.,2,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
There are many times it will not detect motion when motion is detected it only records for 12 seconds if motion vs recording does not continue after 12 seconds there is a cool off period and then another 12 seconds of recording is done image quality is very good night vision very good but this is not enough for me to purchase it again they are other cameras that is much more satisfactory for just about 5 or 10 dollars more for more than 12 seconds of recording you must pay for this feature this is unacceptable there are other Chinese cameras that give you 30 seconds of recording and if there is motion it continuous record until motion is done,1,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0

The video quality is excellent.  I’ve not experienced any disconnections or issues at all.  The 64 gig cards record several days of video and playback is a breeze.

it will only record for 12 seconds - and then needs to cool down for 5 min so if someone walks up in those 5 min it won't record the event.  people have come to the door and knocked or dropped off packages and the camera can't see them.  but it will record a passing car in the window.  very frustrating and the support just tells you to ck the  settings.,1,1,2019-11-21,1,1,0
"I liked the ease of setting up this camera with the app on my iPhone. I didn’t like the picture I was getting by placing this camera in my front window, the many reflections from the lens lighting and the window were very distorting.

"This camera does what I need about 80% of the time. Sometimes it works great, alerts me to events, playback is nice and quick to pull up with the app. Sometimes it will flake out for a week or so until you go reset it, or it will record an event, not tell you about it, and then refuse to pull up the video. It's a mixed bag but honestly for $20 it's better than a feral cat for security. I don't regret the purchase but I also don't entirely trust it. Your mileage may vary.",3,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"Love!  Put inside, facing out a window.  I used two layers of black electrical tape to cover everything on the front except the camera lens to prevent IR lights from reflecting on glass and set it to ""Auto"".  Cleaned glass and used curtain to prevent light from the room to cause glass glare.  Transitions beautifully from day to night.  Thanks for giving peolple without a lot of money a great security option!  Ordered a second camera today.",5,1,2018-5-9,1,3,1
I already have a Wyze Pan camera that I love and use inside the house. I wanted to add a camera to the front window to monitor the front porch and didn't want to spend a lot of money to install a doorbell camera so I bought this one and plopped it on the front window and voila I have a security cam. The shape is perfect and it is very stable on the window. The only drawback is at night the video isn't the best because you're filming through glass but I knew that when I set it up. So I installed a motion light on the porch so when someone approaches the motion light goes on and the Wyze Camera can easily film the person with the light on. Very happy with this.,5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
I love these little cameras. They work great and are super quick to set up. The only issue I have had after the latest firmware update has been with time lapse videos recorded to the SD card. I sent Wyze an email and it took them about a week to respond but have several things for me to try so they are working with me on the issue. I like the company so far and the amount of features they pack into this camera for this price boggles my mind compared to companies like Nest and Ring that charge over $100 or $200 for theirs. I have 2 ring cameras and these little things rival their feature set and the picture quality is about the same if not even better.,5,1,2019-6-2,1,0,0

This is advertised to work with Alexa echo. It does not. You have to have a spot or view. FALSE ADVERTIZEMENT!! I spent 20 min with Wyze to find this out!! I was also told I can go onto Siri and ask her to open my Wyze cameras. It worked yesterday now today tells me I don’t have a Wyze app which I do. So the only way to look at my cameras is to go into the Wyze app manually and pull up my cameras. What a waste of money on three cameras,2,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
Nice little camera.  The motion detection works well.  I like how the clips start before the motion.  Good night vision but high contrast shadows aren't great.  My main problem is a big one.  It only records 12 second clips 5 minutes apart.  I wanted this for inside my garage.  And 12 seconds doesn't even allow for the garage door to open let alone see who is entering.  Instead of 2 weeks of free online clips they should give us a set amount of storage and let us manage the space with an option to buy more space.  Also a deal breaker is the 20 second delay in the live feed.  Fix these issues and I'll get 6 of them for inside my house.,2,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"I love this camera! I tried a video doorbell but I refuse to pay a monthly fee to store and or watch my videos.

This one I'm able to turn it off and see clear as day through the window! It's not AS clear at night but I can still definitely see everything and it still captures any movement. It did stop giving me notifications after a few weeks, but that's ok. It still records whenever there is movement so I can just check if there's anything I need to look into! I'm definitely going to buy more, one for the back porch too. And I love that I can talk through it and hear, I'll talk to my dogs when I'm at work.

It's usually the dogs moving around the house but what if it was an intruder!  It's nice to know whats going on at my house when I'm not there. I showed my co-worker and she was so impressed with the system that she asked me to order one for her so that she can monitor her 7yr old Epileptic son during the night.

Then, once connected, it shuts itself off after a while and then you are again unable to re-establish a connection unless you again recycle power to the camera.

To compensate me for time and other equipment purchased to fix an issue caused by Wyze, they sent me a free Pan cam. Both cams work amazingly well now, and the AI person detection is the real deal. Best cams you can buy, even better than $200 HomeKit enabled cams (after, of course, troubleshooting the crap out of the Wyze cam for a week). I’m assuming the firmware issue is resolved now, but I am scared to attempt another firmware update. The Pan is incredible, however. If you have a lil extra cash, buy the Pan.

I understand you can get rid of the limit with the subscription, but having tested other security cameras, they don’t have those time limits and it makes a big difference.  Especially when this is about security, you don’t want to get a partial video.  Take out that time limit, and I would have bought a lot more for my house.",4,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0

We got this for our dachshund who is at home while we are at work all day. We watch her and talk to her. It was very easy to install the instructions are great. If you are afraid of the streaming being stored you need to cough up more money. Honestly just unplug the camera and make sure it’s off if you don’t want anyone watching or reviewing your footage.

Ok. So I bought this for my grandmothers room. She needs constant monitoring especially at night. Easy to set up. The feed is constantly buffering though. Sometimes it won’t load and I have to exit out and then open the app up. It definitely needs a refresh option. This will do it on its own sometimes. It’s very possible it is my WiFi connection . I have no clue. It also lags. There is a delay on the feed. It’s not exactly real time and I have had an issue with the motion detection alerts. I turned it on and I have not got one alert .

"Ok.  It's $25. Yes, it's low end.  The base is plastic.  It's way too easy to bump and throw it off what you want to record.  BUT - it is easy to set up on the phone.  It connects quickly.  It has good picture quality.  The night vision is very good. Plug in the power,  set it up,  wait for the blue light,  and you are ready.  Move it anywhere in the house, plug it back in, and as soon as the blue light is on,  you can watch it from your phone from anywhere. It's great for the price.  Just don't expect extreme durability. I'm satisfied with it,  for what I needed.",5,1,2017-12-15,1,1,0
"The camera ain't bad for the money. It's no where near as good as my arlo pro 2 cams tho. The wyze image looks a little bit dull, but like I said for the money I'd buy a few more. The app offers alot of options and customizations. I had a heck of a time connecting it to my google wifi. Since the cams require 2.4 ghz. I have found a fix tho. If you use a wifi extender (which is pretty much another router) you can trick google wifi . When you set the extender up choose 2.4 ghz. That way you will always have 2.4 for anything else you need 2.4 for.",4,1,2019-3-8,1,0,0
"Waited and waited for my Wyze V2 Cam ~ I had such high expectations.  Yesterday morning I installed my new Sensi Thermostat and then I got my new Echo Dot up and running and then finally time to set up the Wyze V2 Cam and put it in the cute weatherproof birdhouse.  One, two, three, four and on then on the fifth and final try I gave up.  I spent almost 2-1/2 hours trying to get the cute little cam set up but just never got there.  I was googling and reading everything I thought might help but nothing worked.  After reading all the disappointing comments re: the Wyze app I now believe it's the Android Wyze App and not the product that's the problem. If you too can't get your cam to finalize the set-up it's probably their app.  Good luck to all of you, guess I'll wait for the Wyze Doorbell which is supposed to be out later this year..",1,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0

Spent $100 on them; tried for weeks to get them to work, even had the WiFi company come out to help (which I Paid another $50 for) with connection and confirmed I have the correct type of  WiFi. The cams will not connect to network. I went out and got two more from a different company called EZVIZ, they connected immediately no problems. The Wyze cams never worked for me at all. I can’t return two of them so I lost $50 and plus lost the $50 for WiFi people coming out. Lost out don’t waste your money on this brand of camera.",1,1,2019-9-14,1,0,0

I am switching from nest to wyze and am in the process of grading it’s capability. I have 3 wyze camera’s now and working through some issues. Night vision on the Wyze is no better or worse than the nest cam. You really need outside lights to help the image out. Motion detection is better now with AI and people option but still too sensitive. Sends too many warnings but working through this by making the sense zone smaller. Picture quality is very good! As good as nest a $250 camera. More info later.,4,1,2019-7-14,1,0,0
"These are an amazing innovation especially considering the price. For those that are hobbyists, modding the firmware is well documented and a lot of stuff can be done to add additional featuresAlso, the way Wyze works (without a billed service) provides privacy compared with Ring, Canary, etc. since no credit card or address is required, making it difficult for monetization of your personal information unless you want to volunteer personal information.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"Very stressful setup. Kept getting connection issues. Tried different phones and different networks with no luck. Eventually after a day it magically connected and worked. Had it for 4 days as of this review, and it detects motion fine camera is clear, and infrared at night is great quality. I use it to monitor my puppy at night in his crate. I get notifications, which you can turn off if you don't like them, that tells me when he makes noise (ie. Wakes up). Doesn't detect him moving around in the crate sometimes, but you don't want motion detection to be too senstive with notifications on.",4,1,2019-12-5,1,1,0

Played around with it for 10 minutes and learned how to use the audio, share with a friend so she can see my camera from her phone 15 miles away, and man the night vision is awesome.

Very good picture quality and lots of options on the app such as motion detection and notification. Easy set-up is a plus...my only complaint would be that the cameras tend to have issues with micro SD cards. Standard SD cards tend to fail quickly or are not recognized at all...from the comments I've read, the camera will require a ""high endurance"" SD card. Also, keep in mind, 32gb is the max accepted by the camera...",4,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0
These Wyze cameras are great and inexpensive. Small size and very easy to set up. The App works great on my IPhone or IPad. I have two of the Wyze Cameras around my house and I have integrated them with the new Wyze “Sense”motion sensors and contact sensors for a house security system. All work really well. The only downside is not being able to turn them all off. You want the surveillance when you are away but not so much when you are home. Like ALL camera systems you must be aware that ANY camera system can be hacked.,5,1,2019-5-17,1,0,0
I research and thought this product was the way to go. It was not. It was hard to setup.You need to download their app. Their app did not work. I couldn't even create an acount. Took several days for customer service to get back to me.,1,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0
Everything people say is legit. DON'T buy any other webcam. DON'T spend 4x and more on a webcam that does the same thing as this does for less than 30 bucks. Simple to plug in to set up. Then simple to watch with the app. Motion sensing phone alerts are just as good as an alarm system. I have three. I'm here buying three more. NEED an outdoor weatherproof version. I have one in my yard wrapped in a baggie... if it gets wet and quits? Big deal. It cost 27 bucks,5,1,2018-8-21,1,1,0
This was my third camera from Wyze. This one I ordered would not send notifications or record video during motion. I sent emails back and forth to customer support. They ultimately gave me instructions to do a firmware flash procedure. This worked like a charm. Great customer service from Wyze. I love what you get out of these cameras for the money spent. Unbeatable in my opinion. I have other camera systems but none beat these guys for what you pay for.,5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"For $26,I can’t complain about anything. I’m using one in garage and second one as puppy cam,and these cameras are great for it! I got ring door bell and security cameras on the outside of the house. But there’s no way I would pay money I paid for ring cameras to watch my dogs or to check if garage doors are closed. I’m planning to buy 2 more,to watch my pooches and maybe to stick one on our fish tank. And if somebody in China wants to watch (highly doubt it..) my dogs scratching themselves on the floor or stare at my garage door,I say let them watch. I don’t have these cameras positioned anywhere near bedrooms or bathrooms and I’m always mindful about where they are,before I would parade naked in front of them. Again,for $26,I say get one! Also never had any issues with set up,picture,sound,connection (got strong WiFi extenders throughout the house for all the smart bulbs,plugs,cameras...) or any of that,super simple set up,useful functions and even better when connected to Alexa!",5,1,2019-2-18,1,0,0

You just can’t beat these for the price. They work great indoors or out and at the price if they fail just toss them and get another. Never had to do that but they are priced so well you can set up a nice group of them for a great price and cover everything.

"For the price you simply cannot go wrong.  I had a professional surveillance camera system installed years ago and was spotty at best and costed thousands of dollars.  This is so much more than I expected.  Picture quality is superb, I’m super impressed with the span and or range of such a small camera.  Night vision is also phenomenal and so much better than anticipated.  Setup is super easy and takes no time at all.  Directions are clear and simple.  I only wish that this camera would work facing out of a window at night, as it is not intended for outdoor use.  In my opinion that would make this camera ideal.  But overall I’m super happy I purchased this, I’ve since purchased 3 more plus 1 for a friend.  Highly recommend",5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
I have 4 stars overall because it’s hard for my children to understand what I am saying through the camera as well as the fact that it’s so delayed that they are responding and I can still hear my voice while they are trying to respond so I can’t actually hear what they are saying. Picture quality is awesome and so is the night vision.,4,1,2019-12-11,1,1,0

I spent multiple days and emails talking with Wyze tech support but I got so tired of getting one response (with advice of something I already tried), then wait until the next day to get a response.

"This little camera came very nicely packaged and I had no problems getting it started. I used it inside the house to monitor my pets. At first the picture was clear and sharp but within a few days, the picture began to look washed out. The 2-way audio was also very noisy with shreeking sounds whenever someone talked through it. Then it began to drop connection continuously and  it became very difficult to get the camera connected again. I would have to reset the camera or sign out of the app and sign back in again several times to get it to work. I had the camera within 15 feet of my router and it would not stay connected.

So because of this reason, I decided to monitor what happens at home. It was an awesome buy. The quality of the video is amazing. The sound also its great.

With the blinds open it would catch cars driving by everytime, which yeah that says that’s a lot of notifications coming my way but you can control times and have sd cards added if you don’t like that. You can talk into your phone with the app and what you say will come out of your camera which is cool. My wife and I are both connected so no matter where we both can see what’s going on.

Very simple to set up. It does what you need it to do. The time lapse feature has been hard to use and I suspect it *may* be that this device is really picky regarding the internal memory card used. I wish it would work with an NVR like a Synology Box - that would be a game changer. Also wish there was an all-weather / outside version but in general this is a $25 camera with a nice design that delivers an image that is often better than a $250 POE camera.

Have had this for a couple weeks now. Tried it indoor and pointed out through a window. Indoor worked pretty well but didn't always send me notices of movements. I also wish you had the option of longer clips. Pointed outdoors it often misses important events. It has yet to detect someone pulling infront of my house and parking. It has yet to detect me pulling out of my driveway. But it has sent me clips of no movement and every single car that drives past my house. Misses the mailman everyday.

"It is a camera and it does work, but it's really not very useful for security or home protection. When motion or sound is detected, the recorded event video is only 12 seconds long. Some of that time is before the event occurred. So, if a car stops in front of my house, the recorded event is over before the person reaches my doorstep. I would probably never have any evidence of someone taking a package from my porch. Another problem is that there is some delay after one event before it will trigger the next event.

I may be doing something wrong in the process, but the cameras work well without looping out of the usb on the back. Also, going through recordings can be time consuming if the detection zone and notifications aren't set up right. There is no fast forward or slowmo, just real time and skipping to specific times.

Sound quality is OK and suffers from lag for a real conversation (not really functional in a speaker phone sense, but great for scaring someone in the room).  At for this price, super nice all around.Requires a power cable run from somewhere which can be unsightly depending on location, and the unit is a little distinctive as a camera for covert use if you don't want the monitoring to be noticeable.",5,1,2018-12-9,1,0,0

Motion detection can be a little sensitive but there are options to increase or decrease sensitivity, it just is a little finicky. Would recommend however.",5,1,2019-8-12,1,0,0
"This is an awesome camera for the money for sure. I have it in a window at my front door along with a Nest camera. Since I don't have the part you pay for on Nest, I only get a picture. With this one, I get a 9 second video. Maybe 15-20 seconds would be better and I wish we could choose the length of the video but it really does a great job. It goes off and notifies me at the same time my Nest does. Good quality video. I have not used the sound for it though since it is inside the front door. Great little camera for the money and I highly recommend it.  Guy at the home show I was at saw the video and I told him what it was. He then ordered some for himself.  For the money, it is awesome!",5,1,2018-8-5,1,0,0
"This camera is great, especially for the price. We have one in our nursery and another in our living room. We paired our nursery one with a $34 fire tablet and they work great together (you do have to do some research on how to download the app on the fire tablet). We really like that you do not have to pay a monthly fee for the camera. My parents have a much pricier Nest camera and I think our video quality is just as good, and we have the option to store video on an SD card for free whereas they do not. The night vision works great and has a clear picture. We are considering buying more of these for outdoor security.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"Okay, I read the reviews and decided to give WYZE a try. Especially for the cost! This little camera is great, we can see what we need to see and the first day we used it, I got an alert while at work and it was the UPS guy bringing a package to the door. I have it up in a window looking towards the front. There is a tad bit of window glare from the angle and I have the IR turned off at night since it will reflect, but there is sufficient light so it doesn't really matter to us. I will definitely be purchasing another to have coverage in the back yard too!!! Thank you for this great product!",5,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0
"For someone who is not that tech savvy, this is the easiest set up you could ask for.  Very easy, plug in and record via your mobile phone and Wyze App. Get notifications for motion detection, sounds, people etc and it shows play back for any motion detection. You can also talk through the cam when your not at home ..turn on / off easy for home privacy too.  I originally bought it for home, as I was travelling away, but also purchased so I could check on my dog if going out for a few hours. It works a treat and is very subtle in size.",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"I got this camera to keep an eye on my cat while I’m at work or if I’m away from home for longer periods of time on any given day. I originally purchased this because it came highly recommended and because the affordable price point was also an added bonus. Does the job as it’s intended use, picks up on motion extremely well and the day and night vision work great. I also purchased an SD card separately and I am able to watch playback videos later on if I chose to do so. I get notifications straight to my phone when motion is detected and it shows me 10 seconds of whatever motion was caught on camera. I’m thinking of buying a second camera to use elsewhere in the house. I recommend Wyze if you’re interested in an affordable camera!",5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"Absolutely amazing all around. It has motion detection, person detection, sound detection, carbon dioxide sound alarm detection (if you have the alarm) and smoke alarm sound detection (if You have the alarm). The vision is so clear it’s like HD. I can see my dog clear as day siting on my couch on the camera from my phone. It sends short video clips to my phone. I can also watch live.

"It's small, easy to set up, the app is friendly, it's capable of recording to easily-accessible onboard storage, the mounting solution is fantastic, and it works great as an augment to more serious security solutions. This is a ""secondary"" tier of security in my house. The first tier of security is handled by far more robust cameras with full cloud storage solutions, higher resolution, etc. But at this price point, I cannot recommend anything better.We plan on putting two of them into a Guinea Pig Habitat that I am currently working on so we can check on Little Oliver whenever we want.

"Camera works very well, when it works. During the first couple weeks I was using it, had to constantly unplug it and plug it back in to get it to work. Since I bought it for remote use, that's a bit difficult to do when 300 miles away. I was able to move it closer to my router and it seems to be working consistently even though the view isn't as much as I wanted. It was pretty easy to install. I haven't added an SD card so I'm not sure how the playback function works. Probably can't beat the function for the price.",4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"I have to say that I was very hesitant before I made this purchase because of the price. With other cameras out which I've tried such as the Ring and Nest, they require that you pay a monthly subscription. Seriously?! You want me to pay a monthly subscription after already paying a fortune for your product? So when I found of Wyze doesn't require an extra cost that should be included I decided to give it a go. I am glad I made the plunge. I've had it about a month now and also purchased the memory card, which is a must in my opinion (only $12 extra). The quality is great and while I'm at work or away from home I get notifications when someone passes by my front door. It may seem annoying to some to have so many notifications but you can adjust the settings to your liking. That's what works for me especially when I am expecting a package. I am so pleased with the functionality that I purchased a few more for inside my home!",5,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
"As most of you expect, you usually wouldn’t have high hopes for a $25 security camera. Well this gadget is a game changer. 2 way auto, free (permanent) 14 day cloud storage, just rolls over every 2 weeks, good picture quality and superb night bison. This camera could easily compare to a $200 nest cam. This thing is so amazing. The only downside is that there is no app for pc. But I did manage to find a way around that. You can download an android emulator on your computer (I use one called blue stacks) and it allows you to download android apps and bluestacks turns into an android device app on your pc. This way you can monitor your security camera right from your computer. Other than that gripe, I really don’t have many with this security camera other than I’m going to have to order 4 MORE. It’s so nice to have peace of mind in your own home. If you are on the fence about this, GO FOR IT. You will not be disappointed especially for the price point. I would easily pay $60 for this if it costed that much, for $25 that is highway robbery.  excellent product.",5,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0
"If you're looking just for a straightforward camera with a decent app and more expensive features, this camera is hard to beat. Picture quality is very good, and there's a remarkable number of features packed into its tiny form factor. Setup was very easy and within a minute or two the camera was up and running. My only complaint is there doesn't appear to be an easily accessible IP stream of the camera feed, which binds you to their app more than I'd  like. But if you're just looking to have a camera or two with a decent app, it's a great value.",4,1,2019-1-25,1,0,0
I have two cameras. Neither one will do a firmware upgrade. I'm guessing that's why neither cam will record events or playback event even tho both cams have sd cards inserted. The tech team at wyze sent me links to flash the firmware to the cams myself. And I did exactly as it said and it still would not work. My cams are still not working properly and Im a paying cam plus member. So no I would not recommend this cam. I would pay more for a better system. Don't go cheap. You get what you pay for.,1,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"I'm using this device as an alarm to capture people showing up at the front door. I'm OK to receive notifications in the middle of the night if a fox or a cat is passing by, but in most cases, I was woke up by notifications showing a piece of something flying by. Wyze need to fix their motion detection mechanism.The picture quality looks pretty bad. The HD setting is way worse than 720P. I looks like MPEG2 quality.",2,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
Don't bother with off brand China cameras from T-Mart or GearBest. The Wyze is easy to set up and use and i have not had any issues with it. The only negative or gripe i have is the base not having holes to use screws to mount it to a wall or ceiling. I used the magnet that it came with but vibration causes the camera to shift and have had to get out the ladder and move it back where i want it a few times a month. Overall though it was $20 well spent. I had two different off brand cameras. One broke and the other the generic app did not work well with the camera.,5,1,2019-1-9,1,0,0
"LOVE this camera. I’ve used it for many things, like watching my dog while I’m not home and now I use it as a baby monitor. It works great. Instant feedback from the camera to your phone when there is movement or noise. You can adjust almost every setting to get it how you like. One feature I love is the smoke alarm feature that will notify you if your smoke alarms are going off. Another feature I love is if there is any movement or sound, it will take a 12 second clip and send it to your phone and will also store it there. Definitely love this camera.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0

I followed instructions and plugged in the camera expecting a flashing yellow light indicating the camera has come alive. Unfortunately, it never happened. I tried re-connecting the cable. I tried different electrical outlets. But nothing. I have returned the camera and asked for a replacement. I am willing to give it a second chance primarily because of its price point. I will follow up on this review after I receive the replacement camera.",4,1,2019-1-12,1,0,0
Don’t buy this junk! Don’t be fooled by the hype. If you have 100% WiFi it works fine. But as soon as you place it in a room with less than perfect signal it disconnects.

"I was absolutely amazed by the price of this camera and how amazing the quality is!! It has night vision and the ability to zoom in! I've been basically using it as a baby monitor and security system in my home. It by FAR beats the $200 monitors you find in Target/Walmart.  It's an amazing camera that shows you the entire room from one corner.  PROBLEMS I HAVE: I'm not crazy about the fact that they have to be plugged in, I've had the person in my home unplug them several times and therefore I'm not able to see what's going on.  PROBLEM 2: While I'm at work and trying to connect to the camera, I keep getting error messages that tell me ""cycle the camera"" and cannot see anything all day.  It works great at home though. Also, it records automatically sometimes and saves videos to my gallery that I don't want or need.  Lastly, sometimes it freezes (not often through)",4,1,2019-2-12,1,1,0
"A simple solution to the 12 second alert video that everyone is complaining about is to buy a $10 SD Card.  I bought a 64GB card for $19.99 and it holds roughly a weeks worth of HD video that I can use to go back to the alert time and watch every action that took place(Before and After the alert). The 12 second alert video is to inform you that there is movement detected, NOT to give you evidence for Law Enforcement. With the SD cards you will have that. Before everyone blasts me for recommending that you spend more money, i suggest you consider that everyone is willing to spend $900 on a new phone every year, so why not spend $10 on your home security and peace of mind? The Camera has worked amazing for me and my success with the camera has encouraged my 3 other households in my family and 1 acquaintance to purchase the cameras as well.",5,1,2019-1-23,1,1,0

The picture quality is very good.  The sound quality is acceptable, and the two-way communication feature works pretty well.They could, however, make these things weatherproof so you can use them outdoors.

The instruction that came with V2 dont tell you the setup button is on the bottom of the cameras where you will never see it unless you pull the plate on the bottom down. It took me a long time to find a place in my house where it would connect to the router. I may return it if it only works in a few places.Finding setting after you have installed it is difficult.

Update just got two more! They seem to keep getting better both on hardware and software. Setup was super easy. Both cameras got firmware upgrades on first start up. Again went without a hitch. There is even an option now to down grade the firmware if you do have issues. My v2 units do work with other software programs.I only wish you could adjust the duration of the video when it captures from motion detection. I believe it's automatically 12 seconds.

"Purchased two of the wyze cameras for monitoring the house when away. The cameras arrived quickly, setup was extremely easy. The only complaints I have with the camera itself is that it only comes in white. Need to add mat black option. The software needs some tweaking on the playback screen for installed microSD card. The time line scrolling feature might be good if you have continuous recording on. But if the camera is set to only record events to the SD card it should have the list of events just like viewing from the server events page. On the time line there is no indication where there are events and scrolling through on a mobile device is not that user friendly. Fix this and it would be a 5 star product.",4,1,2019-1-31,1,0,0
"A bit complicated to get going if your not tech savvy, if you move it or turn it off you have to go through the whole process again and it won’t work until after several tries, I like the adjustments for motion and sound but it won’t continue recording on motion for long, maybe I missed an adjustment on that feature, but it works and you get alerts to your email like it says it does",3,1,2019-1-29,1,1,0

"I love this camera, it's great for the price and just to keep an eye on things. It is slow to notify when there's a flagged motion so you wouldn't be able to use it for immediate action but for low security it's soo great. I use it to check on my pet and see who goes in my room. It has a calendar to let you play back motions it detects throughout the day, and each video is labelled with tags like motion and person so you can comb through them quickly. I also like that I can turn it off when it's just me in the room so I don't feel watched. The app is very user friendly and organized, highly recommend for observation, not prevention.",4,1,2020-6-30,1,1,0

"Seriously, for $25 this camera rocks. It will start to get a little janky over time but with a recent software update you can set a daily auto reboot which keeps things running smoothly. The free 2 week cloud event storage (very limited) with face/person detection, even with the low 10 second capture limit, are shockingly useful. Push notifications whenever anyone shows up my front door (or leaves) are fantastic. Motion detection works well enough and the picture quality, while not great, is certainly good enough for the price paid. I would only stress that the camera is $25 and If you are looking for pixel perfect 1080p60 video it's not happening. However, the overall value of what you get is outstanding.",5,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0

"This camera for the price, is a nice little gadget but it lacks some features I believe are necessary to make it successful.  Camera setup is extremely easy.  My setup was to record motion detection to the cloud (free feature) without audio, and no push notifications.  Limits of this free cloud storage are 12 second clips.  Generally more than enough for the average user.  But I discovered that the unit would not record again until 5-8 minutes later.  That leaves a whole amount of time where there is no recording.  I then installed the onboard memory card which gave me true motion detection recording (records until no more motion).  This worked well but the navigation controls in the app were lacking.  Specifically: No 1x, 2x, 3x speed control.  Setting the pointer on the timeline to a non-record segment would result in error instead of taking you to the next available one which is how real recorders work.  I was also unable to discover how to download video from the camera into my phone or tablet.

It takes a 12 second video every time the sensor is tripped and the app sends you a notification right away.

My wife and I wanted to improve our home security with some cameras and had no prior background knowledge on what we would need. After a little research I stumbled upon these cameras and couldn't believe the features that came with it or the high reviews when it was significantly less expensive than any other option I had read about. I expected to pay as much for one camera as we did for the whole system + 3 SD cards + 1 extended power cable. We purchased 3 of them and have had them up for a little over a week now. Setup was a breeze. It literally takes 2 minutes per camera and they are up and running.The Wyze app works really well and the UI is very easy to navigate. It works perfectly on the home wifi the cameras are connected to or on the go over a data connection. About the only thing I would say towards improvement would be to have a web browser option as well. As of now the only way to manage the cameras or review footage is with the smartphone app.,5,1,2019-5-13,1,0,0
They keep on improving the software but the hardware remains the same. if you are placing these inside facing through glass windows the infrared night vision is completely unusable. The infrared spotlight bounces right off the glass and back at the camera. But other than that I am 100% impressed with the entire package. And integrates easy into the app that is available for any smartphone or tablet and works exactly as advertised. I just wish that they had made a desktop app as well as the Android apps.,5,1,2019-5-11,1,0,0

"I purchased this camera with an accompanying sd card. No instructions came with the camera but I had watched a video review & it was pretty basic for my needs so instructions weren't really necessary. I only wanted to record on the card, not install any aps or use it wireless. I plugged it in & could hear a clicking noise but nothing else to indicate it was on. When I went to review my recording, my laptop indicated something was wrong with the card. There were files already on it, one labeled ""Tim"". I was unable to open any of the files and nothing I tried to record was showing up.  I considered retuning the camera but for all I know, someone else has registered that camera or there may be some internal storage. So it's going in the trash. Waste of money.",1,1,2019-8-31,1,0,0
I took the microphones out. Good cameras but wow no privacy with these things. For $20 not bad quality but privacy is out the window,1,1,2020-5-30,1,2,0
"What a great product in such a small box. I was a little reluctant at first because of price, box and many other offering products and then going out of business.After I installed the first one, I loved it so much I winded up buying two more. I didn't have a single issue with this while other product which sells for lot more had plenty of issues. I am even using this in a strange way to monitor other systems which are not so reliable.",5,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0
"I don't think I am that happy with the picture. It gives a hint of what is going on but it curves in on the edges and I don't think, with the wide angle aspect, it would be possible to identify anybody at my front door, even myself. The camera is just a bit over 11 feet from the door, in the only spot it will reach to an outlet without an extension cord laying on the floor. It is cheap enough that I don't feel that bad about getting it, and I will try different placements later on, even outside. Battery powered may be the way to go,but none of them can beat the price.",4,1,2019-3-7,1,0,0
I absolutely love this camera. I bought it initially when my baby was 2 and I felt comfortable letting him play in a room without me. I could watch him and feel safe that I was watching him in real-time and that I could reach him quickly if anything happen. Since then I have moved and we have put it in the garage to watch the house when we are away. I am now waiting on the outdoor version to add to my Arlo cameras.,5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
I had no idea when I purchased this camera that in order for it to work I would have to pay $1.99 Per month after the 2 week free trial. I also purchased a camera card along with it but the camera card will not fit inside this camera.I feel like I wasted my money. I was able to see a picture during the 2 week trial. And it did detect motion and sound but I was never able to see the video..I purchased A Camera card with it but for some reason it does not want to fit in the camera.I tried to place it in my garage and It did not work completely.It notified me that motion and sound was detected but after that when I try to view the video it would not allow on me.I did receive a flash picture and the picture looked clear,2,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
Very nice for the price you pay.Can be viewed from anywhere in the world if the cámara is connected to wifi.Records in real time and quality is 1080p so it’s a very good and sharp imagine.Good a motion tracking and work great at night with its night vision mode.Would definitely recommend as a indoor security cámara when not at home.You can hear and talk through the cámara.If you want to use it outside you’ll have to buy some outdoor case for it.Would really recommend and soon to buy another and also want to try out the pan which spins 360 degrees.,5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"Camera stopped working after less than a week, wouldn't reconnect to the network. I called tech support and they got back to me after about four days (their website says 2-5 business days). Turned out the SD card I was using was a class 4, and while the camera worked at first, once the card filled up it couldn't properly re-write and it crashed the system.Did a factory reset (very easy) and bought a new class 10 SD card (was about $7 for 32GB, so not bad at all). Working fine now. It would have been nice if they had put that note about the SD card class on the instructions, but I still give it a 5-star rating for good customer service.",5,1,2018-12-9,1,0,0
"I have many of these cameras and am very pleased with all but one.  One cannot update it's firmware and after a power off reset will stay offline for hours while other cameras in the same room are fine.  Wyze support unfortunately is of little help.

Just frustrating as offending cameras are not always in an easily accessible space...",3,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"I love almost everything about my Wyze cam! Th e picture quality is fantastic (both day and night,) the motion and sound detection are on point, and I love how it’s so easy to upgrade the software and check in on what’s happening at home via the app on my phone.The ONLY reason I didn’t give 5 stars is due to the fact that it makes a clicking noise at night when adjusting the night vision. This, unfortunately, scared my daughter so much that I had to remove it for her room— which I had it stationed to act as a baby monitor.",4,1,2019-11-19,1,1,0
This camera is good for the picture/video quality. However it is so unstable and drops the connection to the server all the time. I’m always offline even when I’m at home watching Netflix which is also connected to the same server. When the cam tries to connect it makes a loud clicking noise over and over again. The noise drives me crazy.,1,1,2019-6-5,1,1,0
For only $25 I would say this is a pretty good camera. The video is clear and the app is easy to use. Everything is customizable on the app so you can turn on and off notifications and everything else. At night it is not the best. It's ok but looks a little grainy. I'll have to go thru all the settings to see if there is anything I can do to improve that. As of now I have not found anything. During the day it is Crystal clear. Overall a great camera especially for indoor use or daytime use.,4,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
I have now bought 3 of these cameras. Started out with one just to try it out and was very impressed. I might buy a couple more. They are easy to set up and pick up my wifi signal all the way on the other side of the house. Picture is very clear. Haven't tried the night vision yet. Will use these when we are away from the house. Wish they sold covers/hoods for these because the white sticks out like a sore thumb wherever you place them. Believe it or not I couldn't find any on Amazon. Go figure.,5,1,2019-5-19,1,0,0
"So glad I bought this! At night, I pick up my dogs' food bowls. For about a week, I found the bowls empty in the morning. In order to solve the mystery of The Disappearing Dog Food, I bought this camera. Turns out, I had a family of mice. So if you're wondering, the night vision feature works great.Now that the mice are gone, relocated to a field a couple miles away, I turn this on before leaving for work. It's a great camera. Catches just enough footage for me to see what's going on, and gives me a little peace of mind",5,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"LOVE THESE LITTLE CAMERAS!!!  they are tiny but powerful and i love the magnetic.  they snyc to Alexa so so easy. the picture quality is crisp. and the two way radio on it a clear as well.  If i wanted to us this by my front door i could .  It better and cheaper than using the door bell ones. In fact i actually use the Pan cam camera in my window by my front door instead of the cube for security right now because i am in an apt and i didnt want to mess with the door bell. I feel more secure now that i can see who is at the door without opening it and i can monitor if something is left at the door or not.,  LOVE them.",5,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
Very easy to setup and very good image quality and features for the money. Seriously. This is tremendous bang for your buck. With a little ingenuity you could set up an elaborate security camera system for hundreds less than a specialized bundle. Especially with Wyze coming out with motion detectors and door/window sensors you can link to your cameras.,5,1,2019-4-11,1,1,0
"Best product for the money by far.  The product itself is quality, the Company itself may be smaller than their competitors  but they have great engineers and financial backing.  New products coming soon, and no I do get paid to say any of this.  I am an impressed customer.  Good way to save on monitoring fees.  Check them out for yourself.",5,1,2019-8-10,1,1,0
I am over all happy with the camera and will be ordering another. Yes it has a horrible noise when using the speaker in or out but you can still hear. The camera would not connect and I finally gave up. I connected my Samsung smart things home security with hub and then tried to connect my camera again and it connected within a couple seconds. It has awesome picture and video quality. Motion and sound detection. I actually really like the sound section video clips. You can set it to send you notifications. I love it so far! I will be plugging it into my smart plug just Incase I need to reset it when I am away.,5,1,2019-2-2,1,1,1
"Love: Great bang for the buck. I agree with the positive reviews. Easy operation, no nonsense; I can’t add to the happy reviews This camera has earned them!Don’t like: The sound. Nice two way intercom but they can understand me but they sound unintelligible.",4,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
Have owned this camera for about six months and can't say enough good things about this item. Very inexpensive but packs a punch. One of the best investments we have ever made to monitor and secure our home. Picture quality is great. Motion detection is ok; sometimes it picks up bugs and other times it misses a person at the door. Highly recommend!!Follow up Nov 2019: Purchased another one the other day. Still performing well. Sometimes the notifications are delayed.,5,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0
Without getting too technical or over the top on every little tidbit or pro and con this is an excellent camera for the money. It works really well for almost every situation and is priced to allow me to purchase multiples without worrying too much about the expense.  Wyze focuses on a solid licensed Hardware product and then works to improve the software the Wyze camera utilizes. Most other cameras that are available use a version of software that really doesn't work very well. Wyze created their own software and sheavily invested in working to improve it.,5,1,2018-1-14,1,1,0
"The value for this camera is unbeatable in my opinion. At the price point it is exceptional. Picture quality is really very good, however it does skip occasionally, a lost second or two randomly, but for home it's great. The biggest drawback I can say is the audio never seems in sync during playback. It's fine during live streaming but definitely off on playback. Again, I definitely recommend this camera if like myself the minor drawbacks mentioned are not critical to you. They are also well built and have a wide angle view to cover a large area.",5,1,2018-12-30,1,0,0
"I just setup this little camera and I am amazed at the picture. It is REALLY sharp.My plan is to put it in my 90+ yo mothers house to keep an eye on her.

I have to set it up again at her house but the Youtube video made my first setup at my house a breeze!!",5,1,2019-5-5,1,0,0
I rarely write reviews..but the reviews I read are ALL TRUE! This is a very good little camera for the price! This is my first video surveillance cameras and I must admit...I'm shocked at the quality for the price! I'm very satisfied with the performance once I figured out how to get the QR code to be read! LOL! All my fault though. I figured my errors out. I would like to see 1 thing. I would like for you guys to offer this camera in BLACK! Every little video camera these days comes in ONLY white! What if I don't want everybody to know I have a little camera in the corner watching my place when I'm away on personal pleasure or business? That is the only thing that I would suggest and the only thing that makes me not give this little guy 5 stars. I'm considering taping it off and spray painting with a gloss black myself! The quality is very good for your money. You would get more than 25 feet of HD clarity...but for the money...you can't beat this little guy! Kudos to you! Offer the BLACK WYZECAM...PLEASE!,4,1,2018-8-7,1,0,0
"We bought this after someone recently tried to break into our home while away and I am very satisfied with this camera! It was very simple and easy to set up along with the app. My favorite feature with this camera is it's ability to detect movement and people and will send alerts to my phone. My husband leaves for work a couple hours before me so when I wake up in the morning, I will have an alert on my phone saying ""Person detected in the mudroom."" and I can watch the playback. We're also buying two more for the home, one for the front porch and our new baby's nursery.",5,1,2019-8-9,1,0,0
"There are lots of PROs for this little cam.  It is easy to setup.  It is easy to use.My only ""con"" for this guy is that you can't disable audio for the live stream.  That's something I would like, and I see on the Wyze forums that others have suggested that.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,1,0

Light can shine and it picks it up but other movement doesn’t. I have made sure all updates have been completed as well. I purchased because it was cost effective, but I’d rather pay more for a better product. Wanting to add more cameras but will not be going with this brand.",2,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"If you’re looking for a cheap camera for any room in your house, go with Wyze.  Cameras for your home can be expensive, so I tried the Wyze Cam V2 for a few months now to keep an eye on my townhouse when away from college.  So far, it hasn’t given me any problems.  It has functionality for my Alexa devices, as well as IFTTT.  It has great picture/audio quality for the price.  Although, I am not the type of person to be afraid of technology and look at the fine print.  I use technology for everything, and if some Chinese company wants to “watch” me as many of the reviews claim, so be it; I’m not an interesting person to spy on.  I genuinely do not believe that Wyze would be using our information and video feed for malicious purposes, and I will continue to purchase more of these products now that I have seen all they can do!",5,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0

Well known issue of product defect. Some cameras where made without a circuit required to recognize an SD card. Well I landed up with one of them. They did say they would send a replacement.That said all these tech companies seem to think yours and my time isnt worth jack. They make products and tech that isn't ready for prime time then sell it anyways. Then we have to use our time to trouble shoot. email them and generally use our time to test there products. Humans only have so much time on earth. Isn't our lives worth anything to them. I dont think so.,2,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
Have been using these before (got them when they first came out). and they work extremely well. I have used them outside (they are indoor cameras) and they performed great...no issues although it is NOT recommended to do so. They were protected only by being under a porch roof. For he price you could not ask for much more as they have all they have all the bells and whistles I'll ever need. A great product at a great price. Did I mention customer service is  top notch!!! Don't know how they did it but I'm glad they did. A GREAT product at a GREAT price!!!!!,5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"Terrific security camera at a great price. I compare it to my Ring camera and is as good or better. I already have three and as soon as my Ring subscription expire I'm dumping the Rings and replacing them with all Wize cameras. It is so easy to use with so many setting options.  Love the fact that I can save videos to a micro card and to the cloud for free, with the Ring system, you have to have a pay monthly or yearly subscription otherwise the system is basically useless and on top of that, you can't save videos to a memory card.All we need now is a Doorbell Cam and outdoor camera from Wyze (I'm using a third party outdoor camera housing with great results)",5,1,2019-4-23,1,0,0
I haven’t used night vision yet so I can’t speak on that but I use this as a baby monitor and It’s the best $18 I’ve spent on peace of mind.This was suggested from a mom group i’m in on facebook. I wanted a camera to sync with my phone and allow me to put my son down and get chores done around the house/yard. The picture quality is amazing. I can also hear if my son is stirring around AND the motion detection picks it up too. If you search a baby monitor... the cheapest model with crappiest reviews is minimum $70. This is $18 and amazing. HIGHLY recommend.,5,1,2020-7-10,1,1,0
"Wyze makes a great camera and the value is way beyond their competitors. The app itself is decent but I wish there were a few more customization options.For instance, I wish you could customize the notification sounds so a person alert is different than a contact sensor or a text message. I also wish the software didn’t have a cooling off period after a vehicle pulls into my yard. I only have notifications setup for people alerts and if a car pulls up and a motion is detected, I miss the person alert when the person gets out. I also wish you could easily mute notifications for a time. When I’m working in my garage and I know I’m going to be in and out, I don’t want it alerting me every time I come back to cut a piece of wood but I do want the camera recording in case someone decides to wander in a steal my tools. A “mute notifications for an hour” button would help me.",4,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0
"The live view has worked well except once. Updated firmware and it starting working again. The main complaint is the time it takes to reset once it records.

If you have some kind of light outside (I dont), just turn the night vision off to get a clear picture. All in all it is a great product and the app sends me alerts if someone or something moves outside (I have a neighbor who thinks it is fine to trespass)It is an indoor camera but I suppose you could mount it under a porch or in a box. Mine simply is pointing at my back window.",5,1,2018-12-22,1,0,0

"You aren't going to be able to do better at this price point.  The image quality is good, night vision is good, motion detection is great.

This camera is the best thing that ever happened for home security. Despite what they say about outdoors it works 100%. I have used it with and without the bird house looking covers and works flawless. I stay in wi and it has survived 9 degree weather and snow without a hitch. The fact that you can record continuously with an sd card is priceless. I have already stopped two car break ins with these cameras. The only gripe I have is the motion is super sensitive so it activates from leaves falling etc. Also if you dont have your phone on the notifications sometimes dont come through for 5 minutes,5,1,2018-12-29,1,0,0

Don’t buy a doorbell camera — just set this thing up in your front window and enjoy the benefits.  Audio may not be the same if installed indoors, but everything else supersedes the top-selling doorbell brands.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
"I work overnights, so leaving my pups home alone was worrisome. This camera allows me to leave them at home with ease, knowing I can talk to them if necessary. The night vision works well, as does the app itself; though it uses a lot of my phone battery. Set up is easy. Great item for a great price! Though good to note there is somewhat of a timely delay. The plug in cord could be a little longer, as well as maybe have a battery back up, or utilize a battery to charge so it doesn't have to be plugged in the whole time. Would also be nice to include an SD card with original purchase.",5,1,2019-5-18,1,0,0
Ordered two they ha poor directions. So light and small could not be read. Then they did not work. Asked for replacements.  Sent two back and only received one. Told supplier. The temporary hotel where I was staying looked for 4 days. I packed up for a move. Forgot about the issue. Went to set up the new ones in my new home. The one I received does not work. No instructions at all.  Now I can not get the 4th. I use amazon all the time. Not happy.,1,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0

"Only records 12 second clips when it detects motion. Don't be fooled when they say that if you buy an SD card it will record longer clips. You basically have to set the camera to record continuously, then sift thru your footage via a cumbersome and poorly designed app. This thing is every bit JV if you're really looking for a security camera. It's only good for watching your dogs or as a nanny cam. For security, it's garbage.",2,1,2019-11-29,1,1,0
"I wanted a simple cam with free cloud storage for monitoring our basement drain that has backed-up with clear water when it rains heavily. The benefit of it being able to monitor the carbon monoxide and smoke detectors in the basement is also a plus. I've had no real problems with it. For $25 it is a great deal. No complaints. Want to add one to monitor the front door for when I am in the basement. Maybe even the backyard. For roughly $75, being able to basically monitor every major entranceway is pretty amazing. The issue is finding plugs in an old home.",4,1,2018-11-16,1,0,0
"I wouldn’t refer these cameras if you’re looking for a security system. They almost never record video even with a memory card. For example I’ve had mine for about 2 months and have 3 random recorded videos when it’s suppose to record 24/7. Also as far as the motion detection goes I wouldn’t even call it hit or miss, it’s a completely non existent. It will capture shadows or small bugs but unless I’m in front of it for 20 or so minutes it doesn’t set off the motion detection.

Also great for babysitting evening to see if she is in bed on time and sleeps peacefully. Easy to set up, you can access view from wherever you are and it is affordable compare to alternatives. Only comment is that night vision could be better. You need to install camera over the crib and have it plugged to work and see your LO good. if you want to see form bit further away, unfortunately night vision get blurry.

Motion detection is spot-on.  The video Clip that is captured shows the motion and also displays the still picture on the ‘events’.  Software to adjust motion detection is flexible.  Easy to install.  Notification is reliable.  I noticed this company is constantly improving their software and adding features that are useful like person detection when motion is detected.  I have this pan cam as well as their non-pan camera.  Both are great!,5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
I was skeptical about wyze since they were priced so low but this camera works great. It has two way radio and records sound and video. Better than arlo which is price MUCH Higher. This came in our back three season room/summer game room. It records motion outside and at the exit door and even in the driveway passed the door. It picks up sound in the yard outside too. WE LOVE IT! Best $26 dollars ever spent.,5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"A lot of mixed reviews when it came to this camera so I was hesitant to purchase it. However, it’s pretty great for my needs. You do need a micro SD card if you want to record while the camera is on, it won’t otherwise. But that’s not a big deal for me, I only use the camera while I’m out for work for the day. Usually doesn’t need to be recording more than 8-9hours so my 64gb sd card does the trick. The motion detection is pretty 50/50 on whether it wants to work or not that day. But I look past it since I can just view the playback recording if I want. I’ve noticed it’s better at picking up motion detection when the lights are off. Again wasn’t a total deal breaker for me. The picture quality is great, with normal lighting or night vision so I can’t complain. The app is very easy to use and I don’t ever really have any problems connecting to it. Also the setup is quite easy. I’ve probably had the camera for about 3 weeks now, I’ll update if there are any changes.",4,1,2019-9-27,1,0,0
"This camera and app work VERY well especially for the price. The only drawback is the low frame rate, or whatever, causes moving objects to not be as clear as still or slow moving objects. For the price though, it is more than acceptable. The app is what you would expect from a high end US tech company and in my opinion is one of the main selling points here.I use this is a sort of doorbell cam. It survived a Buffalo, NY winter completely uncased. I do have it under a porch roof but otherwise it has been exposed to wind, rain, snow and -10F temps without failing once. I get notifications when anyone pulls in my driveway (during the hours I set) or walks up to my door.",5,1,2019-3-10,1,0,0
"On point with capturing motion. It captures when a fly flies near the lense is our most common false detection but in defense, that is still a motion. Recorded clips are 12 seconds which can be a pain in the ass. Our door has a glass piece on it and when a shadow is seen, recording starts. Takes more than 12 seconds to open door and get their whole body inside. Camera stops after 12 sec and sometimes does not capture face of person entering house. Does not capture a new motion immediately afterwards either. Would love to have a tracking motion to follow a person or videos longer if there is continued motion (like there is still person in camera view, it should not stop recording)",4,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0

"Bought this camera some months ago and finally decided to write a review. To be honest I didn’t expect much for the price. I thought ok cheap camera were at least I can tell if people are in my house. When I pulled out this simple looking cube I thought. Yep. El cheapo  Special. BUT IT SO MUCH MORE! This camera is down right amazing! The camera has perfect video, the motion sensor you can adjust to be super sensitive also the sound sensors. The two audio works perfect and I often talk to my kids with while I’m at work. The night vision is great and best of all.... drum roll.... you don’t pay for a stupid membership it’s free! Also if you get a SD card you can record 24/7. No SD? Well the app saves 12 second clips if it detects sound, motion, or a person. So screw thinking about a 200$ ring you have to pay monthly to use.

"I got this camera so I could keep an eye on my home while out of town. The first time I used it, the unit fell over and faced the floor until a pet sitter righted it. It worked pretty well once it was upright. The second time, it disconnected itself from the network and wouldn’t turn on. I see that’s a common problem on online message boards and the solution is to power cycle the camera- unplug & plug it back in. I got it for when I’m away. If I were home to power cycle it, I wouldn’t need a camera. I’m annoyed that I’m just outside the return window, so now I’m stuck with this.",2,1,2019-4-11,1,0,0

Its just for a quicker look for us after the notification comes in because sometimes my phone/app doesnt open quick enough.The camera also continuously records with the installation of a memory card (up to 32g). hd, sd, and 360p settings will determine how many days you can record also.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"Great little camera that is easy to set up and use. First off, it's simple and is not cluttered with a lot of features I'll never use, Second, it's entirely controlled from the Wyzecam app on my iPhone. The camera itself has only one button: Setup. Not even a power switch! After the one-time setup, you can move it wherever you like without additional adjustment, just plug the USB power cord into a power source (PC or wall plug w/ USB adapter) and you are off to the races. Video quality is quite good, but it can be jerky if the camera is set to HD mode and you have a slow wifi system, so take that into account when you set it up.

"Was recommended this product through a friend as a low-cost alternative to the RING video systems. The Wyze camera barely works, rarely connects, and is unreliable as a security measure. The app you use to control the camera is clunky and unresponsive. The camera itself looks great on the very rare occasion that it connects, but these are not even remotely effective as a RING substitute. They are cheaply priced because they are an under-performing and barely useable product. I attempted to set up so I could monitor my dog in his kennel during the day... this product is useless if it does not reliably connect, but don't assume you will get your money back.

The camera is decent for what you get and what you pay. I have four cameras total (but only three work reliably). I had one replaced because of a failed update and I think another just crapped out on me. There are some instructions online to flash the firmware but don’t know if I’m interested after this last failure. The first issue was resolved eventually with a replacement with a refurbished unit. I’m currently trying to reach tech support and I’m either met with a message that no one is available and an immediate hang up or being on hold for too long. Any hold time approaching 10 minutes is unacceptable.,2,1,2019-1-14,1,0,1
"The camera itself is put together well and I was easy to set up but the quality of the image is far worse than the pictures I have seen online from other Wyze cams. I don't know if I got a defective unit or what but overall image quality is pretty blurry (It looks sharper along the right edge but that is all). I placed a MicroSD card into the camera to see if there is a difference between the file that gets stored there vs what is streamed from the camera but the image on both seems to be identical (both blurry). Also I've noticed the audio quality is absolutely horrible - when watching recorded clips there are lots of distortions, pops, and a general warbleness to the sound so much so that it's near impossible to understand what people are saying in the room the camera is in.I'm going to contact Wyze to see if this is normal or if I received a dud. Besides the video and audio quality issues, which are obviously critical components for a security camera, I'm surprised at the lack of controls and settings available. There are no user configurable options to set things like bit rate, sharpness, brightness, contrast, FPS, etc. Also there is no way to view the camera from a PC - the only way is to use either an iPhone app or Android app - that's it! I have a Wansview K3 1080P camera that I've used at another location and it has a lot of options to configure by just connecting to its built-in web server using a regular web browser. The Wansview also has apps for iPhone, Android, WIndows, and Macs too if you want to use an app. The Wansview isn't perfect though - it's app is not as well designed as the Wyze and there is no free cloud storage either - but in terms of PQ, audio, and streaming settings, it has the Wyze beat.",2,1,2019-1-15,1,0,1

BUT, they offer local storage on a MicroSD card that allows you to continuously record. The problem is that the software is so buggy and the devs put all the processing on the little camera. So when you try to record what has happened in the past, the app is so disfunctional that you cannot capture the clip you want. There is also no web interface either.. So then you might say.. well i'll take the card out of the camera and put it in my computer.. NOPE.. reformat. Completely a waste. The most annoying camera i've ever used. Not worth $25. It is just another one of those cams produced by some Chinese dude's that laugh all the way to bank about how idiots buy it and give it good ratings.",1,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0
Overall the camera is great. I have two setup in my daughter's room. One above her crib and the other across the room so I can see when she goes into her room and just to have an actual view of the room and not just her crib. My only gripe about the camera is after a power failure they do not automatically turn back on. You have to physically unplug them and plug them back up in order for them to turn back on. Not sure why that is the case but for both of my cameras I have to do that if the power ever goes out.,5,1,2019-6-2,1,0,0
I purchased 3 cameras and it took about 15mins to setup all of them. Connected my smartphone to the 2.4Ghz wifi and started the setup. It was pretty straight forward after that.Have been using these cameras for couple of weeks and following are few observations-,4,1,2018-12-30,1,0,0
"It took about an hour to get this camera set up and running. My son contacted the website and chatted with a tech person to walk him through getting the codes required for using. I'm using this for a ""doggie cam"" and, when I check in during my lunch time, I get a black and white picture of my living room and no movement squares. I talk to my dog to see if I can get movement, only one time did I see him move. When I talked to him, no reaction, so I'm not sure if he's hearing me or not. I restart it and try again, one time within 3 days did it show color and my dog. I'll keep working on it, as it does show what it's supposed to, it's probably user error as to why I'm not seeing what I should be.",4,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"Camera quality is superior with excellent picture quality both in ample light and infra-red. I love the value by way of the ease of use coupled with the highly affordable price.

"Bought this to as to an expensive camera, after watching comparison videos on YouTube.  I give it 4 stars because there is a very audible click when it switches to night mode.  So far the features of this camera are far better than getting a ring.  In the community side you can setup rstp and view on a pc.  And other free software can record to a pc.

"I have eight Wyze cameras now 6 of these and 2 Pancams.  7 are outside, 2 fully exposed (with case)  to the rain and snow of Seattle.  It was a record year for rain and was expecting the exposed cameras to have a problem.  One did but it was just earwigs inside the camera; after extracted it worked fine.  For the price compared to others it's cheaper to replace them if you need but haven't so far.  ...I also like how these folks run their business.....",5,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0
"Absolutely worthless.  Bought this for one reason:  to catch the irresponsible owner whose dog is destroying our yard.  It's great at capturing people walking on the sidewalk, but it cannot capture the ongoing problem.  Such a waste of money, and far from being a secure camera to boot.  Time to trash this junk and get a real camera.",1,1,2019-4-29,1,1,0
"Why spend hundreds of dollars when you can purchase the same quality and features for $25? I have three of these cameras and their outdoor wall mount. I have one outside, in my backyard, which has worked flawlessly for four months now. It is currently -15 outside and working like a champ. So not only are they amazing for the price, but they can even withstand Montana weather. These cameras also caught a man jumping our 6ft fence. Without these cameras, I would have never known. Thank you for making this amazing product! We plan on buying three more.",5,1,2019-2-3,1,0,0

"I can not believe these cameras! I bought one to start, with the old saying in my head 'you get what you pay for' expecting them to either be total garbage or at the very most just so so. I am totally blown away by these cameras! I bought 2 more and now just another. The quality is pretty darn good and the sound is pretty descent. A few quirks I wish they would do with an update, is maybe to give an option to record longer intervals once the camera is set off. It only records 12 seconds, which sometimes isn't enough time. And I wish the push notification was a bit quicker. It's generally about 2 minutes behind. Also there is lag time from one recording to the next. If a sound sets it off, and right away there was motion, the motion more than not isn't going to record. I do very much do like the option for the times I want it to start and finish recording. This is truly a great feature especially when you have some indoors. It's nice to be able to set the ones for outside to record all the time and the ones indoors to record from the time I leave till I get home everyday. I also like the fact that I do not need to have sd cards in them (although I will get around to that) if something is recorded I can hit the share button and save that video right to my Google photos.  Even with the few things I have found would make it better for me, that's just my personal preference and in no way prevents me from buying more. I'm up to 4 of them, so they must be doing something right!",5,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0
"Very nice cam, clear picture. I have installed a 128gb micro sd card. In sd mode, I can continuously record up to 3 weeks. In HD, it about 2 weeks.You can view the card on your phone by day and time. You can also format the card form your phone when you through viewing.",5,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"Looking at their main website, they advertise this camera to work with google Nest Hub. However, this feature doesn't appear to be working. It seems to be a common problem according to other people in Wyze forum. Have to give this a 3 star because Nest Hub was going to be my main monitoring screen ...In terms of functionality, the camera is user friendly. Picture is clear, phone app and notifications are working fine. Sound quality is acceptable. I'm happy with the product, just wish that they can fix this Nest Hub integration quickly.",3,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"A nice little camera. Easy to mount with its magnet. Its wide field of view provides a pretty good picture. Its night vision is surprisingly good. Its motion detection is excellent.

"This camera is great, easy to setup and get going. The adjustments and magnetic base are a plus. Just don't expect to have any local storage with the micro sd card. The product line is all defective with that issue. I've got the run around with formatting and followed all the instructions to setup local recording & storage. So I wasted a lot of time(and a little $$) with SD cards then formatting on computer and camera.

"This is a great camera for the price! I purchased one and followed by getting a couple more. The motion detection is a little slow to turn on, but I have been using the camera on close buy objects so this is understandable. Every once in a while I have to cycle off to reset the connection.

There are ways to get around it, like using a certain light bulb on the porch but it's a hassle. Motion detection is sometimes too sensitive so you have to play with it.

"$29.99 for a security camera? I fully expected to try this for a day and return it. Instead this device is going to replace my Canary Flex! A little background - Canary has started to put a lot of the features that made it an attractive option behind a subscription paywall. I mostly use my camera to check in on my dog and cats when away from home - so $9.99 a month for basic monitoring features is not worth it.So enter WyzeCam - is this going to replace your professional home security system? No. A Canary-All-In-One or the full Nest setup is probably a better option for you there. But if you want something to just check in on your home and get some basic alert functions, also GREAT image quality (like way better than my $200 Canary Flex!) and two-way audio (admittedly the sound quality there is pretty bad) - all for $30, then this is well worth a shot.",5,1,2017-11-29,1,7,0

"We got this to keep an eye on a property in Florida (we live in Indiana).  At first look, I was impressed by the picture and sound quality.  I wasn't sold on the need to use their app to monitor the camera, but setup was easy, so no problem there.However - after our last visit, I got home and found that the camera was offline.  The only fix is to cycle the power to the camera.  If I could do that, I wouldn't NEED a camera.  I have other wireless devices in house and they are all working just fine.

I don't think you can find a better bargain for a security camera than the Wyze cam. Great price and all of the features you need. Wyze keeps adding features. I use it to check in on my dog while I'm at work. Integrates with the google assistant and Alexa. Currently only google assistant allows you to turn on the camera by voice. Neither Alexa or google will allow you to turn off the camera with a voice command--hopefully that will be added later.,5,1,2019-8-6,1,0,0

I know some people mentioned privacy issues - I didn’t experience it.

It saddens me that this is my 4th Wyze cam bought and the first one I’ve had an issue with. Just out of the warranty to return. It stops working. I take the casing off and there’s a piece detached. I wondered why it would only work occasionally. As well as I was never able to insert a SD card for some oddly reason. And I can’t return it now. Very disappointed in this last cam I received. :(,1,1,2020-10-1,1,0,1
"I purchased this camera to be able to view my dog in his crate when we are not home. It is a good camera for the price. Setup was very easy and it connected to our WiFi with no issues. Software/application is good but sometimes it is slow to update, so I am not sure if it is a rendering issue or a buffering issue or just a WiFi bottleneck (even though we have a very fast network). I have been using the camera for 3 weeks and no issues whatsoever. It is plugged in so no worries about charging battery. I just wish they did include a zoom in feature in it, instead of zooming in within the app which pixilates the picture. Also, I did not try the voice communication since I don't need it.",4,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
Amazing quality and features for the money. I ended up returning for me to upgrade to the one with pan option.  These cameras are fantastic.

At first I was very happy with this purchase. But within the first week we had problems with the cameras disconnecting. We would have to hold them up to the device and re-power them and use the QR code.This began happening several times a week. That was hard enough to put up with. But when we move the cameras outside and mounted them under the eaves  of the house it is now a super hassle to get a ladder out to do this two or three times a week! I like the product. I like the price. But this problem with not being able to keep a connection is not worth the hassle.,1,1,2018-12-24,1,1,0
"Decent network ready cam - neat  feature is “motion sensing” based on noise. I’ve only seen other cams be off motion, and we’ve setup in nursery so it’s been an awesome feature. Wish there was more settings for picture adjustment but it’s good enough. Surprised in the default motion clip saving “ability” several days worth of many 1-ish minute videos. Others we’ve had expire after 24 hours so I prefer this cam’s ability here. No gyro control — but flexible install options. Would consider buying another if the need arose.",4,1,2019-1-8,1,0,0

In addition the ease of use to add to our BLUE IRIS security system is a breeze just need the IP address and its done!  The alexa show is amazing.  ""Alexa show me living room camera""  and you got a incredible quality picture.  With talk to and from, cant beat it.  Keep up the great work and quality.  I cant believe you can make this fine piece of macninery and sell it for $25.00  It could easily sell for 50-100.00 and I still would consider buying it.",5,1,2019-5-4,1,0,0
Works great. I have 8 cats who after years had decided to not use the litter box. We could not verify who was the culprit so we got this camera and found out within hours. Works great and easy set up. The camera has a great picture also. You can set up to record all day or just certain events that trigger it. You do need an internet connection though to review and receive the data from the camera. Great price and great device.,5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"All the features you would expect in a higher $$ camera in a great package. Easy setup, awesome motion detection, night vision is great, local SD card recording NO STUPID SUBSCRIPTION COSTS.

For less than 30$ you cant go wrong.....I now own 5 of these cameras, 3 cubes and 2 pan and tilt.",5,1,2018-11-27,1,1,0
"I have 3 cameras. 2 are in doors and the other is in the garage.  Through the 100+ heat, this camera continued to function.  A WiFi extender nearby completely stopped working at these temperatures.  Yes, the Wyze cam makes a good connection without the WiFi extender.  An excellent camera.  The 4 stars is for the video replay issues.  Great camera, but the playback interface is not the best.",4,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
You can't beat the price of this camera.  To get this camera with all of its features through another company you would be paying at least $50.  This camera has great motion sensing and gives you all sorts of adjustment to help filter out unwanted motion sensing.  They also threw in free people sensing that was a free firmware upgrade.

"I’ve had two cameras installed at two different locations since December 2017 and they are not very good. The number one issue is connecting to them from the outside. It’s just isnt reliable. Sometimes it works and most of the time the camera doesn’t connect. To contrast I have Ring doorbell on the same network and it always connects. Always. The Wyze just isn’t reliable and if you are looking for something you can count on in an emergency his isn’t for you. Great idea, bad software.",1,1,2018-4-14,1,4,1
"This is the way to go.  EZ setup, connected to my home net work in a snap , and the picture quality is very good. The low cost and not having to pay a subscription for video storage makes this camera the best deal around. The cons are,  it  needs you  for a usb cable to power the camera. and you  need to purchase a water resistant cover to use outside. Over all these are well worth it.",5,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"Haven’t used this for real home security or alerts, but as a monitor for the dog while I am out of the house. It works well with our Echo Show in another room and also very good via the app while away. It is pretty straightforward to set up if you are familiar with smart home products. It definitely increases my peace of mind while away and would make a great baby monitor- definitely a better deal than a specialty item like the Furbo dog camera- and there are no reoccurring fees associated with it!",5,1,2019-12-3,1,1,1

I have cloud camera for use for Amazon key and wanted another camera for outside. Didn't want to spend another $100 on Camara that's only indoor use anyway. Did some research and Wyze camera had amazing reviews both on Amazon and YouTube and decided to give it a shot since only $25. I'm very impressed with it. Easy to install and detection is great.

We have 3 arlo cams and 5 wyze cams to monitor the house inside and out.  We put 3 of the wyze cameras outside to monitor the front, back, and side of our house and it has survived a Vermont winter with no issues.  I would suggest getting a 32GB microsd card for each camera that way it records everything and you dont have to worry so much about missing an event.",5,1,2019-2-24,1,0,0
"I bought this for the purpose of checking who enters my room. I have the same privacy concerns stated on some of the reviews but privacy is a moot point these days once you stream your photos or videos out there so you can access them wirelessly for you to access.  For my own purpose, this camera works for me.  I put my car keys next to it. I place a small desk calendar to block the camera when I arrive from work, then I remove it at the same time I grab my car keys when I leave my room for the day.  This way, I can monitor my room when I'm not there, which is what I bought this for.",5,1,2019-1-4,1,0,0
It was extremely difficult to connect.  Price sounds good but what they don’t tell you is that you need to pay for the card in order to record anything. I had to contact Customer Service when I had to reconnect the phone. Customer Service is awkward and not available by phone. I would have return the product but I was a few days outside the return period. I finally got it to reconnect with the help of the Customer Service via email. It wasn’t horrible but it wasn’t good. Picture quality is good. I don’t have a card to record so I can’t really comment on the motion detection and other features.,2,1,2019-8-28,1,0,0
I love the features on this camera. I can set it to notify me when I am out of the house for sounds and motion. You can even set it to notify you when it hears a smoke alarm or CO2 alarm going off. You can turn the camera on and off remotely from your smart phone and view live what is going on in your house. The 2 way talk feature is great to have. I like the fact that I can view clips in the cloud on my smart phone for up to 2 weeks without any fees. I am in the process of buying another Wyze camera.,5,1,2019-4-2,1,0,0

Super cheap buy and the quality is awesome! Night vision is on auto and that works great. We both have the Wyze app and it streams live right to our phones. She is very particular about her room and her things stuff going missing and siblings not fessing up so she got the camera.

"Everything was great for a while.... Then I have huge issues with not only the cams, but the memory cards that the cams destroy some how. I ended up buying THEIR BRAND SD CARDS and they are now starting to fail just like the others.... There goes $60. Don't bother putting the cameras in the window and expect them to work at night with it's ""night vision"". The IR lights just reflect off the glass and the camera just picked up bright light and nothing else. The night vision will also allow you to see about 5 feet... If that...I've tried to contact them and they just won't respond anymore. They first tried to tell me all this technical mumbo-jumbo, and if your not computer smart, forget it. I responded back with what I didn't understand how to do and they just stopped responding. I've sent several new emails with new issues and still not a single person has responded.

I went to another part of the house and used the microphone to talk thru my camera and yell at my 4 year old son.  He was wandering all over, looking under furniture, and yelling WHAT MAMA.

Next, we're going to use it to watch the hummingbirds. Well worth the money to me.",5,1,2019-9-21,1,0,0
This camera was so easy to use and the HD image is so vivid and clear. You do get a little pixelated imaging with motion but is still much better than I ever expected. Was easy to set up and we can’t stop playing with this cam. I originally got it because I have had some issues with prowlers and wanted to capture footage for law enforcement under our carport and driveway. However we are also having lots of fun talking to the family cat over the two way audio. And we couldn’t be more pleased with the night vision quality.

I must say that I've never been more confident about the security of this property nowadays, after installing this. It has push notifications, so after activating the motion or sound detection, if something moves or a sound is heard (you can adjust sensitivity) you'll be notified by their own app, which is very well designed.",5,1,2019-2-19,1,0,0
"JUNK! They don't register events well at all! Walking back and forth in front of the cameras doesn't register as an event.

It's like they only record events a few minutes apart, everything else in between is ignored. You'd be a MORON if you trusted your home or family's safety to these pieces of garbage. Both cameras are with 10 feet of a very good router, and I have gigabyte internet, so there's no issue with the wifi. Some forums people have said having the SD card in them causes them to act up...

"Cons: Do yourself a favor: reset your WiFi prior to beginning the camera set up process. You will save yourself  so much time and energy.

My only complaint is that screen rotation is very limited, or at least unintuitive.To position the camera to get the shot I wanted, meant I had to view the video in full screen landscape, but rotate the phone to see the portrait picture.",5,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
"The camera has a good video resolution, continuously records videos in MiniSD card in 1 min increments. However, the big drawback is the 5 min long blindness to motion detection between two motion detection events Hardly can be used as a surveillance camera. Intruders can induce false motion and then have about 5 min to break and enter into the house. Instruction is short and incomplete. You have to guess how it works by experimenting. Long response time from the motion detection event to push notification on your smartphone.  The description says 'You don’t have to get a notification every time something Opens or closes. Set Wyze sense to only send you a notification when something is open longer than it should be', however, there are no indications in settings or in instruction how would you do it.",3,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0

Good camera for the money. I would like to recommend. If you are using the outdoor mount. Connecting to 2.4 may be trial and error. I had 85 percent signal but the connection kept dropping. Used wifi analyzer and noticed an issue with the channel I was connecting to. Changed from Auto to the best channel and both worked fine! Usually routers are set up as Auto by default.

I use this to check in on my dogs. It does great live. Not so much with the motion detection. Although it stores for days it misses a lot of the motion. Not just distance but my husband 2 feet from the camera. He walks right in front of it and it records nothing.

The Unbelievable is the delivery time that Amazon delivered this camera so close to Prime Day and the Nice is that this indoor Wyze Cam v2 just replaced a returned indoor Nest camera from another company (because of the subscription costs and only a 3 hour free viewing period (if I remember correctly) and only having 24/7 live viewing) and the Wyze Cam has a two week free subscription period and you can save your videos and photos to a micro sd card and you can have live viewing anytime you want to.  I calculated the costs of owning each camera and since I am retired the Wyze Cam v2 won out.  I do feel that the Wyze Cam has more features and functionality than the Nest cam had and the picture quality is about the same because they are both 1080p.  If I would have known what I know now about both the Nest camera and the Wyze Cam v2 I would have definitely went with the Wyze Cam v2.,5,1,2019-7-14,1,0,0

A few weeks ago my Fiancé and I suspected that an unwelcome relative may have been coming over when we weren’t home and we needed a camera solution that was cheap and fast which lead us to find the Wyze cameras.I was a bit hesitant because I thought “how great could this little thing be for only $25?” but let me just say that this thing is awesome! I get alerts sent to my phone within seconds if I am at work and activity is detected. I’m able to set commands that let my camera know when we are away or home.",5,1,2019-2-17,1,0,0
"We bought this cam to watch our pup while we are not home and it’s great! It connects through an app which you can open at any time and see in real time whilst a happening. The night vision is also really good and the motion detection is great👌🏻. There’s also sound and two way talk which is handy when I wanna say hi. You can’t beat this product for the price, may buy another to put somewhere else! *only downfall is that is must be plugged in at all times in order to work. If your power goes out in the house- it will too. ( I have another cam that stays on for 2 hours when unplugged)",5,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
"WOW! I was looking at Nest camera deals for Black Friday and these popped up on a review. At $30 when I bought them (they're actually $20 on their website I later found out), they do so much! I have internet access, I get notifications on my phone & apple watch, you can speak through the camera if you want, it's excellent. My one for the door is inside the house in my window. They are pretty sensitive so I have them on low but you get used to the notifications.They are very small - they also have a good length in the power cord.",5,1,2017-12-11,1,0,0
I bought this cam to peek in on my dogs while I’m out. It has a pretty wide range that it covers and I’m able to see the whole room. I might consider buying one or two more of these to put in different rooms because you have the ability to link them all to your account and see them all in the app. Set-up was super easy. You can also speak through the camera using your phone and the sound quality is pretty good.,5,1,2020-6-6,1,1,1
"I was going to return but my friend changed my mind. In order to get the video to load I have to turn my wifi off. It's frustrating waiting for the video to load and it sometimes connecting and other times it isn't. The picture, sound and motion detection is all amazing. The only reason I have keeping it is because I would like something when I am out of the house and can check in. It also is a good price",3,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"Love, love love the Wyze cameras.pictures are crystal clear, can zoom in on any part, night vision is perfect. Plug it in, sync it to your internet and you have video of anything you need. I put them indoors but also put one in the window pointing out front.. through window and storm window it delivers a crystal clear picture and sends alert if motion detected. It's nice to be able to check in live or watch something from a week ago.",5,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0

"I have a total a 2 of these cameras and love them! For the price, it has an amazing picture and pretty decent sound. I got an SD card for each so I can replay anything longer than the 72 hours it saves. The only negative thing is if you need to press the, “speak” button, it’s very gurgled and hard to hear. Also, sometimes when you view the playback, the sound doesn’t match up with what your viewing. For the price, I’m okay with all those things. These aren’t high tech cameras. They do the job and their great!",5,1,2019-1-8,1,1,0
I put this camera five stars but only to get everyone’s attention who is considering to buy it. Some people unfortunately don’t read negative reviews so To make a long story short please read carefully all of the low score reviews for this camera. Unless you want to be spied on in your own home- don’t buy. I guess most of the people who scored it high may not be very tech saavy and don’t realize they could very well be watched Do your research on any web cams but ESPECIALLY any one tied to China.,5,1,2019-3-18,1,0,0
"Very easy to set up using the Wyze app.  (Make sure if you have a router that has both 5g and 4g service that you use the 4g network.  Will not work (yet) with the 5g service and the install will fail to finish.)  Great features for the price, with good picture quality.  Once I get the hang of this one, the software that is, I will probably order more for inside and potentially outside use.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"The camera itself is well made and the app is fairly nice, however the app has no option to rotate the camera 90 degrees, I am also not getting any event notifications despite motion being detected on the camera and app. It is not recording to my SD card despite formatting it. This camera is only useful as a glorified live streaming camera. Not being able to record footage makes it useless as a security camera and not notifying me makes it useless unless I'm staring at the live stream.",1,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"My husband & I ordered these security cameras for inside & outside our home. We are extremely pleased! They work perfectly! They are easy to put up.. &  to connect to our cell phones. By simply downloading the Wyze app. I love that I'm able to check on everything at home when I'm not home. I also like that i can now just check on my phone and look at the ""front door camera"" whenever someone happen to just show up unexpectedly. Lol I am able to see who it is first rather than just answering the door to who knows who lol. ALSO these cameras have a two way intercom. They have speakers & it's so we can talk to say the kids as we're checking in on them. And they can talk back. If someone's at our front door waiting to be let in. I can say ""I'll be right there!"" So yes these are GREAT security cameras! Plus the price is amazing & definitely worth it! I highly recommend the Wyze cam! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"This camera is inexpensive, easy to use, very functional.  I'm shocked that I would get something with this quality for that price I paid. I don't usually do these reviews but this product warrants it. We use it to monitor our elderly father at night, connect it to our cell phone and it sits on a wireless charger, we use it on an iPad for a larger display.  It has sound that, so we hear everything, and see everything.  Like a baby monitor, but much less in price. Great app that will control multiple cameras from anywhere using the internet. Just a great product, well worth the money.",5,1,2019-2-1,1,1,0
"I like to try different products and own 5 different security cameras from different companies. I wanted to take the time to share how impressed I have been with this camera above all others. I have had car break-ins in my area and this camera was able to detect every time a person walked near my car and record a clear image of that person, day or night. It can link up with other systems I have in my house like my wifi enable switches for my outside lights and turn them on. I have loved the ease of integrating into a mixed bag of systems and simply work. The price was also fantastic, it is so much more than I had expected. I would recommend this to anyone for indoor or covered outside use.",5,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"I just used this to record 24 hours of driving. Just plug into your car’s USB port/charger and away you go!This never stays connected. The latest update didn’t help. If you buy one, keep the packaging so you can use the great Amazon return policy. At least it was cheap.It hasn't connected since 1/22/18.  It is 1/31/18.",4,1,2018-1-11,1,8,1
"Wow, I was really positively surprised by this little cam! I had no problems connecting it to my home wifi, the app is intuitive and works great. Camera gives you tons of options as far as image quality, sound recording, recording events, setting up modes etc. The night mode is impressive as well, as its IR LEDs really can brighten up an entire room that's pitch black while only giving off a tiny visible red glow from the LEDs. I see no reason to pay 4x the price for a more US recognized brand. If anyone is concerned about Wyze ""spying"" on you somehow... well I doubt they would risk their new reputation to do something like this, but even if, there is absolutely no guarantee that other ip cameras won't do the same.  Completely recommend this cam!",5,1,2019-1-24,1,0,0
"I bought this camera for myself because I have a lot of animals at home. I’ve been searching for a good camera that is affordable and effective. This camera shoots in 1080p which is just what I needed, I can see everything in my room clearly anytime from my phone. The zoom option from the phone works great and it obviously will get graineras you zoom in but the quality is still great fro the price. There is a way to speak from the camera which helps me when I need to ask someone to do something real quick while I’m out of the house. I have other types of cameras that are more expensive that don't do the same things this camera can do which shows that this camera goes above and beyond the small investment. I’m very happy with my purchase and I’m thinking about getting more of these for security just because spending $100+ on cameras that do the same thing as this just isn't worth the time. Overall, a quality camera, good audio and durable (I’ve dropped mine a couple times) and it plugs in so I don't have to worry about replacing batteries which is better for my busy schedule.",5,1,2019-3-6,1,0,0
"I am currently using this inside of my vehicle with a power bank, I park in a side alley and this is more of a ""just in case"" so far I have no issues, I think I need one that has a wider angle of view and maybe slightly better for night time.But overall I would recommend this to anyone who might need a decent security camera on a budget because it is exactly that a decent security camera with a nice look and cheap price point.",4,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0
"I'm a technician for a security company with 15 years of experience. And I buy an unknown brand from time to time to check out. Now the camera, the stand is pretty good but doesn't have 100% full motion Moore like 80% but it does hold steady. Love the magnetic base. For 720 it's ok , I'm used to 1080p. I don't really care for the wide angle lens, but that is what the manufactures  are going to. Not much between SD and HD , so I leave on SD to save space on the micro drive. the app is a little glitchy and won't connect all the time but the camera does seem to record 100_% of the time. The sound sucks, period. Would,I but again, yes, he'll $25 why not,",3,1,2019-1-21,1,0,0
"The entire reason I wanted this was because I didn't need to pay for a separate service monthly and could access this camera from my iPhone, but this cam would not connect to my wifi router so it, therefore, was useless to me.",1,1,2020-7-28,1,1,0
"We recently had an issue with a package being stolen off our porch - seemingly not a big deal, but a huge invasion of privacy as well as a high-value item stolen.Using the footage from the Wyze cam, the police had identified the suspect within 24 hours, which is incredibly fast! The detective handling the case specifically remarked that the video quality from the Wyze was absolutely fantastic, and that most of the footage he receives is pixelated and unusable.",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,1
I've waited to do a review on these until I really knew how they worked. I've had one for a little over a year and another one we just recently got a month or two ago for our babies nursery. So far they've came out to be great cameras and have caught our neighbors doing some pretty interesting stuff on our porch. Overall I would say they are great product we've tried Arlo cameras and ring but they cost so much and charge you just for the services that you should get with the camera basically. But wyze has even allowed us to choose our own price even if it was $0 for the motion detection but we decided to do $2 a month to just help out a little . I'd say these are great cameras for the budget-minded person but I think they're great cameras no matter how much money you have. They could be mounted anywhere and come with the free app.,5,1,2020-10-3,1,0,0
This cam is really cool. I am 61 years old and never heard of this until my daughter told me about it so I got one. Now she can check on me from her house to make sure I’m OK. We have it set up in my bedroom so she can check on me. She also has two of them one in her bedroom and one in her kids bedroom we have it set up so that I can check on her too. And you can talk toEach other on the cams. I love it,5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"Got the cam and couldn't get it to turn on for anything. Eventually I found another USB cable that would fit into the oddly deep oval shape preventing most any other normal micro usb fit. Well as I said, I found another cable that fit and low and behold it powered on. So the brand new usb cable that was provided was dead.I'm glad I was able to save myself a return hassle for an addon item, but it would of been nice to have the usb that came with it because it was a long flat cable.",3,1,2018-12-18,1,0,0
"Update 9/27/2020: Wyze has a new service of CamPlus. I subscribed since it's more than VERY affordable. By doing so I now have the option to only get updates when a person is detected (which is what I really wanted) When you live on a busy street there's no way you could get notifications all day long. It'll continue to capture for longer than it originally would too. I had a micro SD card from my old camera that I used. That's helped too. I'm going to get a new SD card for it though. Very user friendly and should you need support they were very helpful. I still highly recommend this little camera!Very easy to use and set up. The only thing I'm not happy with is the amount of alerts I get. I tried to filter it to only show me people but I still get a ton of notifications of other things. So many that I had to turn it off. Which then there's really no point of having the camera other than if something does happen, hopefully I'll get a pic. Also there's time lapses where it doesn't tape. For example, I've had it tape people coming in my house but not leaving. But for $25 it's a good investment.",4,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
This was my 3rd Wyze Cam purchase. So far all of them are performing extremely well. I'm sure I could find a security cam with better video quality but definitely not at this price.

"Best camera for the money. I did have some serious issues when we moved getting the Camera set up. The first time it was plug and play with no Issue.

"Picture is fine if viewing on your phone but gets grainy quickly with larger screens. It would be easy to pick out a face up close, but if they were very far away it might be difficult.

"For under 30 bucks, it’s a really good camera. it detects motion and send me a notification to my phone and records a 10 sec clip. it also saves video 24/7 if you insert a memory chip. People are complaining about privacy but literally your phone and laptop camera watches you all the time by the government ever since the “patriot act” of 9/11. If you don’t want asian dudes seeing you dance naked or whatever then unplug it when you are there or don’t stand in front of it naked. sometimes walk around naked after smashing my gf and i don’t care if asian hackers see my pleasure rifle.

The first Wyze can I purchased stopped working after a couple of days but the company worked with me to troubleshoot the issue and ended up sending me a replacement and I haven’t had issues with the replacement and I’ve had it for several months.You will need to buy a memory card. You don’t have to buy the wyze brand memory card. If you don’t have a memory card installed you will miss out on events. It records a 12 second clip when it detects motion but it won’t record anything else for 5 minutes. So during those five minutes you could miss things. If you have the memory card you can view a playback of anytime of day. I live in an apartment so I haven’t had to sue the nightvision because the hall lights keep it well illuminated but the photo quality is very good. It does lag some between something happening and getting the notification. (Maybe like 45 sec delay AT MOST.) but I hear the same thing happens with ring doorbells.,5,1,2019-4-23,1,0,0

"It works as advertised.  Only problem is this camera will not work with your Alexa app on your phone.  You cannot view the camera remotely from your Alexa app on your phone.

A but blurry. But nice pic. A bit behind on time lapse and sound. But really nice. Great service and definitely awesome features. One bad thing is that it needs to be plugged in at all time. Which for security purposes and in case of a power outage it wont work. I'm not 100% sure it it records or if it doesnt at least for a short period of time while internet and power comes back on. But it seems I lost connection and no recording is found when trying to see it during a power outage we had.,4,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0

And their companion app is well rounded and handles well. There are no issues setting up the cameras and it typically only took about 1-2 minutes to add new cameras.That said, use at your own risk.

"I've had this camera for a few months and have used it in 2 locations. The intent was self monitoring security for front door deliveries.Negatives: Not intended for high traffic areas. Once it picks up motion, the camera essentially ""sleeps"" for 5 minutes after the motion event. It picks up rain drops, snow flakes, trees blowing so on a day with any weather, all you'll see is just that. The camera also just stops recording the motion events which requires either a reboot of the camera or loging out of the app. But it happens so frequently that it's not manageable.",1,1,2018-3-25,1,1,0

I’ve never seen anything like it for the price point. I am by no means a tech savvy person but I installed it and set it up in about five minutes. I will probably buy a second one.

Bringing it up in the home app isn't supported, displaying it on a hub or Chromecast enabled device just buffers for 2+ minutes. So I basically spent money for 3 of these cameras with no additional benefit from my previous YI ones.  The quality of the picture is great but I already had that.

"I'd give it a higher rating, but one of the three I ordered won't read any Micro SD cards that said Amazon gave me 25% back in exchange for letting me keep is since all the other functions worked fine. I unfortunately need the SD function Currently so I'll be ordering another soon. Wyze is supposed to be adding support for some NVR protocols soon which will mean that the SD Card slot will be obsolete for my needs anyway. In all it's been a great product.",4,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
"This was an impulse purchase after we caught someone looking at our amazon packages on the front porch. There have been some concerns about where servers are hosted and the privacy thereof, but as long as you turn off sound recording and don't use it for indoor surveillance, does it really matter if someone is looking at your front or back porch?",4,1,2018-12-11,1,1,0
"These are an awesome value at $25!  They do everything you want from a security camera, and work flawlessly!  They have everything figured out, even down to the magnetic base.  The Wyze app works phenomenally, when I have been so dissapointed in so many apps, especially security camera apps.  A top notch product, and one of the best values of any product I've ever bought on Amazon.",5,1,2018-9-7,1,1,0
"Considering all you get for the price, this is an amazing product. Great app, optional loop recording on SD card, motion detection, accessory options, and high quality images. Night vision could use a few more infrared lights, but understandable considering camera size. Looking forward to future offerings, like a more securely installed outdoor version. Only grip is no HomeKit support, but as long as IFTTT stays in the picture, I'm a happy camper.",5,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0
"This in my opinion is the best do it yourself indoor security camera you can buy. The picture quality is amazing and it has some really great features like face recognition, cellphone notifications and you can talk through the cell app to the camera to scare people away or say hi to the kids which they think is pretty cool.  You can also have it warm you when your carbon monoxide detector and smoke detectors are going off and I can tell you from personal experience it works. The best part is the price is great and won’t break your wallet.",5,1,2019-1-29,1,0,0
"I got two of these mainly to monitor with Amazon Fire tablets but it doesn't work correctly and Wyze have no plans to make it work with these.

I bought three of these after researching several wireless cameras (some that were 3 times the cost). We have been very pleased with them and will probably be adding more soon. I have also convinced my sister and a couple worker to order several of these cameras for their houses as well. The support forum they have is very active and helpful. They integrate with IFTTT nicely and allow me to control push notifications with all my Google home minis around the house.,5,1,2019-3-22,1,0,0
I absolutely love this camera. Gives me a sense of security when im not home or even when I am home. Great quality picture and super convenient that it goes directly to your phone through the app. The app its self is extremely easy to use. Microphone and speaker work great on the camera. Only thing I havent been able to figure out is the motion detection alarm that it says it has. But will more then likely be ordering more in the very near future when we upgrade to a bigger home.,5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
Have wyze v2 cam.  Sometimes for reasons unknown to me it loses connection to the android app.  I have had to contact their help and have been put through multiple steps to assist them in figuring out the problem.

"I purchased this to place in a window for the same reasons everyone else does. To be nosy haha! The quality of the image is great. Motion detection and sound all work great. I cannot use the nightvision in my current window, or any for that because I have a full screen in every window and there is too much reflection to use it through a screen. However, it works great otherwise through a regular window. I would recommend purchasing the SD card so you can get video playback DVR options.",5,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
I foster cats and kittens and bought this to check on them while at work. It was a good decision! The camera is VERY  easy to set up and install (along with the necessary app). The zoom in feature is great along with the night sight. It is easy to take photos of the happenings being recorded. I liked this so much I bought another stationary camera as well as the panning camera.,5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"One of my kids was using several of these to watch his house, and the various animals on his acreage. After seeing how easy these are to set up and use, I was convinced I should get a few myself. So I bought three. Quite happy with them. Both motion detection and sound detection levels are adjustable, so you can eliminate most false triggers with proper adjustment. The only weakness I’ve seen on the cameras is in the night vision.",5,1,2019-6-29,1,0,0
"Just purchased this camera and it is amazing. Can't believe how great the picture quality is even through a glass window. Onyl problem I would say is the person detection hasn't worked. Motion detection works pretty good but not for people, and it has a delay after it pick up motion it doesn't pick any up again for a While. I haven't put an SD card yet which will probably make that feature better. very satisfied with it and will definitely be buying more soon.",5,1,2019-8-22,1,0,0
"These are truly fantastic cameras. I installed with memory card, which saves 3-4 days of video. Motion and sound detection work well and are adjustable. I have some mounted inside looking out through a window and this works fine in daylight. In darkness it works OK for the one that is mounted snug against the window, but the night vision light reflects off the window if not. They don’t integrate with my other smart home systems, but it’s not a problem for me. I can’t automatically trigger actions, but when I get an alert from any of the systems I can use this to check high quality video from throughout the house. Also, no payments for video storage was a big plus for me. I just hope Nest or one of the other overpriced more recognized brands don’t buy them to eliminate the threat from below. Also, their technical support was excellent the one time I needed it.",5,1,2018-4-8,1,0,0
"I bought this to keep an eye on my daughter who has autism and my mom who suffered a stroke and was living with me. With no monthly fee or intermediary company, this works very Well!

REALLY great deal with crisp pictures.",5,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
Switching to these from my overpriced Xfinity cameras and subscription. The picture quality is 10x better and it is 30x cheaper literally. I bought 3 to cover all angles outside my home. The notification only when it's a person is a great add on since 95% if the movement around my home is cars. My old cameras became annoying alerting me if all movement every 2 mins.,5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
I was able to wire up 4 cameras for less than the cost of 1 outdoor nest. I used a cheap outdoor enclosure for 2 of my cameras. I had to buy 25ft USB extensions but that was not a problem. One other thing I bought was 32GB SD cards for all cams. The installation was a breeze and the app is really smooth. Honestly I couldn't ask for more given the price. I highly recommend you get one and try it out.,5,1,2019-1-5,1,1,1
This seems to be very well made and better than expected. The set up and app are very easy to use. The clarity of video is very good. I had a security camera that was triple the price but not nearly as good of quality as this one. So far so good. It will be interesting to see if it meets my needs and expectations over time; it just arrived today.,5,1,2018-12-19,1,1,0
"We have had Nest, Drop Cam, Foscam and Amazon.  This by far is the best since it is cheaper, recording cost is nothing.  Easy setup, quick response time on my phone.  I got several of this type and one of the one that swivels 360 degrees. The one that is 360 degrees is really quick, no lag on display.  For the money, you can't beat it.

When we first got this camera it worked great but after the first upgrade it no longer connected to our network. I have tried numerous times and it won't work. I would buy more if it did. It also stopped recording motion and just records everything over and over again. The only way to view the files is to look at them on the SD card but it's useless because you would have to know WHEN it happened and then do the math with the incorrect timestamp.,2,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
"This camera stopped working in 5 weeks, (just after the return window closed) and even while It was working It wasn’t working well, It froze and would not be accessible to view weekly (around 5 times) and the only way to get It back online would be to come home and unplug the power and plug back in. This camera might be very cheap but isn’t even worth a dollar. Spend the extra!",1,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
After 4 days of being connected two out of three cameras are working.  Have tried to contact support for the one that died but so far no luck.  When I call  they tell me to contact them via email.  No response from email yet.  Of the two that are still working they have a good picture and work as advertised.  Motion detection capability is not very useful as it sets off all the time but no motion detected on the video.  Probably better as just a monitor camera or time lapse.  We'll see.,3,1,2018-2-16,1,1,0
Poor customer experience. One of my cameras is malfunctioning and I haven’t being able to get any responses from wyze. I have tried everything on their website and keep malfunctioning.Not recommended at all. I’m paying the cheap price I payed at the beginning.,1,1,2018-11-16,1,4,0
"I set this up for my mother in her apartment and it works great.  I knew she didn't want to spend a lot nor pay for a subscription - worried about ""too good to be true"" but it was low risk, so I went for it.  It's not as fancy as our Nest cams, but it works very well with very good picture and sound quality and it records any sound or motion events that I can review for her on my phone.  Set up was very easy and it has worked perfectly for months. Great for piece of mind and well worth it.",5,1,2018-12-16,1,0,0

"Wyze states not to depend this on security, so it is used to just keep on back porch for extra vewing of delivery drivers, raccoons, etc.  I think I like the cams better than the pan, but they are both fairly equal.  And a good product.  Just dont depend on them to catch a thief.  They are not high security devices.  Company is excellent. Great price..  I give them a 4 star",4,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
Installed two of these outside during the summer. Used plastic cases sold here on Amazon. Temperature has been below freezing and aboce 90 F. They work fine. About once a month they need to be rebooted. I use a WIFI controlled plug and set it to cycle the power every few days.Use one camera to get notifications when UPS or FedEx or mailman drops off package. Positioned camera so it notices when person gets on the porch. Video show me enough to see delivery guy walk up my sidewalk.

"Unlike many of the reviews on here I actually bought the camera and I love it so far! This little camera is packed with so many features and good enough video quality to see what’s going on and/or happen for only $20 and people on here are Bitc***g? SMH.If you have ANY electronic devices nowadays, your being spied on already, from social media, search engines to cable companies, cell phone, smart devices companies. Anything connected to the internet is used for some reason or another by companies to advertise and sell you stuff. So you can spend $100 on a cam and get “Spied on” or $20, your choice.

"I got one of these and one of the rotating ones for my house. I have this one under my roof pointing at my front yard. It's worked great every since I got it.

They do a good job of releasing updates for it too, without them being so frequent as to be annoying.",5,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0

I can't believe the clarity, and the sensitivity of the microphone... I couldn't ask for more. Also if Wyze finds out about a bug, they will send you an email, if its a physical bug in the hardware they will send you a replacement, no return necessary. This company really takes care of their customers.",5,1,2019-9-18,1,0,1
"This camera is fantastic.  I read online reviews about the best cheap cameras for watching pets and this was the winner.  I love this camera.  It was very easy to set up.  The app is super user friendly as well.  I really like that there are no hidden fees or monthly payments for some of the advanced features.  All you have to do is order this camera and that's it.  Two way talk, recording, sound, taking photos, zoom, and night vision are all included in the base fee to buy the camera.  The only thing is that if you want to use night vision, you need to have a light source of some sort.  So when my dog is home alone at night, I have to make sure that a light is on so that the camera can see him.  Other than that, the quality is great for the cheap price.  Totally recommend if you need a camera to watch your pets or to monitor your home!",5,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"hard to believe it's really 1080 resolution - I could not make out a license plate at 50' away. No fast forward option on the app, so searching for events that the camera missed is time consuming. Camera misses events sometime also. Not sure what the frame rate is but it's not great because the video is blocky when viewing in slow motion.  All in all, it's OK but after 2 months of use, I'm upgrading to something better.",3,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"We got this as an inexpensive monitor to check in on our toddler. It will only display continuously on our echo show for about 30 minutes, but it works to be able to check in as needed. I am very happy with the result for the price. We added another one in our garage because it opened a couple times without explanation. We were able to find that out neighbors had a remote that was somehow programmed to both garage doors. It was easy enough to clear all remotes and reset the connection. It was nice to be able to get notifications and check in while we were sorting everything out.",5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"This product goes over and above expectation! It’s a true value for money item that will not only give you great satisfaction for its intended use but it’s ease of setting up, ease of use and perfect pricing is what makes it ideal. We are yet to get a micro SD card to save recordings on it but overall so far it’s great for security and monitoring our apartment. We were a bit skeptical about the price, (a bit on the low side for a good security cam) but when the cam arrived it was just perfect and we are very satisfied.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,1,1

"As much as I'd love a 4k outdoor cam that could read plates @ 50', that's a huge jump in price, and the Wyze does everything I could possibly want and more for $25. Got it with the outdoor case, works very well. Integrates with Google Home and Chromecast so I can tell Google to stream it on my 4k TV anytime I want to make sure my car's okay. Free cloud storage is a huge feature, can't overstate how valueable that is. Until I'm ready to spend a few hundred on the next tier up, it's perfect.",5,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0
"I love this Camera and can't wait to order more of them.  You will need a source to power it so an AC outlet and a WiFi connection.  You can only view using the App, but if you are OK with that then this is perfect.  It has motion sensor and you can get alerts to motion.  You dont need the SD card but you may eventually want it to capture past video.  I wasn't clear on what all the optional SD card does but I think it lets you have longer storage.  You dont necessary need it.  The camera comes with a magnetic base and a metal plate that you can stick on or glue on.

I Purchased this after seeing a review of it on youtube. I needed something as a baby monitor and figured this was worth a try. It works great! The only downside is it doesn't charge so you do have to keep it plugged in. The cord is long so it's not too bad of a downside. It's easy to move from one place to another and I've used this to monitor my infant son and my older son too when he has friends over but doesn't want mom sitting in the same room. Would highly recommend.,4,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0
This really the best camera.  I hesitate to say best camera at its price because that would imply a limitation as to how good it is.  I'd put it up against the more expensive cameras any day.

"I love how compact yet useful this little thing is.  It's great. The bottom is magnetic, the camera itself elevates and adjusts to many different angles, it's easy to set up,  the cord is long enough for my use. I am using it as a motion sensor/visual monitor for an elderly person who gets up and roams at night. It works very well. I'm still adjusting the sensitivity levels.

Bought this camera to set up to watch for my Christmas packages being delivered. Started off great the first day. Next day when I went to watch it it was a white screen. You could hear sound but could see nothing. Had to unplug and reset it. And from that day forward For upwards of 2 weeks I had to do that every single morning so it would work. So I just threw it in my junk drawer cuz that to me is what it was. I took it back out today to give it another shot to see if where I had it (in window sill where it was super cold Cuz it’s winter in northern Minnesota) was issue. I put it in my room and it connected right up and had great picture. Sound was working. Movement detection was working (sister put my dogs in my room) then as soon as it started getting dark in my room night vision kicked on and 10 minutes later white screen again. I am very disappointed and feel it’s a waste of money. Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because when picture worked it was super clear and sound worked (muffled) when screen was white so I could hear my dogs if anything happened.,2,1,2019-2-24,1,0,0
Innovative company with new products in the pipeline at reasonable prices.  I have two of these cameras and they have been outside for over a year with no problems.

"An amazing camera & even better price. with this one not moving (like the Wyze cam pan) it still gives you a good amount of camera footage, with great picture quality.

"When it works, it works well. Problem is it often doesn't work.  Eight times out of ten the app cannot connect to the camera.  I've moved it within two feet of the router, and the router's interface shows that it's connected to the camera via the 2.4 channel, but when I try to access it with the Wyze app it coffetn cann't connect -- doesn't get past the 1/3 mark.  If I reboot the camera by disconnecting the power, it reconnects at least for a while.  Totally defeats the primary use of a security camera -- I can't reliably access it or get notifications when I'm away. Nor, obviously, can I reboot it to regain connection.Customer support is useless.  They don't answer emails and when you call the support phone number you get a recording telling you to send in any requests by email.  How frustrating is that?",2,1,2018-1-24,1,3,0

I have one on the front porch as well, which is often triggered by the herd of squirrels that visits my property even though I have the detection setting trimmed as much as possible, but that's mostly because of the angle of the front window I use for that area, and no fault of the camera's sensors. The flexibility in the detection settings is really impressive, and after a couple days off tweaking the settings, I'm comfortable with the notifications I receive (not too many, except for those dratted squirrels, lol).

First camera was easy the set up. Second one was easier. For 25 dollars this camera delivers a lot. Decent picture quality. Good zoom. Speaker and microphone. Night vision. Movement alerts.

"We own two, one for each child. While I have loved these and recommended them to everyone I know, only after a few months our first camera purchased refuses to connect or stay on! What’s worse is that it will lose connection 6 or 7 times a night, so I can’t hear my baby cry. It’s been a handful of times my baby will cry for 30 minutes before I  wake up and realize the app disconnected or the camera stopped working. I thought maybe it was my internet, but the other camera works fine in both rooms. Last night I spent 3 hours.... 3 HOURS.... trying to connect, reconnect, reposition the dang camera so that it would work. I think it’s hit it’s lifespan which sucks because I barely started using it 6 months ago.

Requires a little work to get it up and running but an amazing product in that it basically does everything that an arlo  camera does at a fraction of the cost. Their customer service people won me over with their excellent support. Would not connect to my home Verizon router as it combines 3G with 5 G. They told me to contact my provider and have them split the signal which is kind of a pain to have to do if it can be done at all. It does work off of my cel or iPad if I set up a personal hotspot. I use the camera mostly in the continuous recording mode which does not require WiFi.,4,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0

The frame is a very wide frame - can capture all of a room and outside/surrounding view as well, which includes our hallways and our front door.My only complaint so far is that the motion detection is a little strange - it picks up human faces fine but also picks up our animals, shifting papers, balloons, etc. I have tried to change this in the settings but there is no option I can find so far. This is alright, however, as I have no alarms set at the moment on our app.",5,1,2019-5-8,1,0,0
"I love this camera for it's size, price and features.  Photo quality is great too both day and night.  For what it costs it can do a lot and features are implemented well.  Even the smartphone app is useful.  I used it with 128 GB card which is way over the claimed supported size limit but works anyway and can store several days worth of video.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,1,0
"The electric will flicker here in this city and the camera doesn't always reboot, even when attempted a restart through the ap.  I have to physically unplug it, and replug it in to restart it.  This is not effective if not at home.  Any suggestions would help.  Image is good, but doesn't always pick up motion from a person, just sometimes, even when the specific area is set for it.. It does detect motion outside the preferred area, but does not alert, which is okay but does make video clip of it.  I am using it through a window looking at front door area..  The reboot issue is the mjor concern, especially if adding more cameras that are more difficult to reach have to restart power often.  Would also like an exterior version that is weather resistant, besides using the offered housings by other companies.",3,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0
I have standard ceilings and the cord doesn’t reach all the way to the top so it looks a bit silly midway. I love the price. Very wide angle camera so you can see more- I plug it in only when I leave my house because I heard of a bit of hacking in my research. But just make sure your WiFi password and account with wyze are different you shouldn’t have to worry,3,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"Love this product! I use it as a front door camera and it actually loads fast enough for me to see who is there unlike my ring doorbell cam! My only issue is that for the life of me I cannot figure out how to set the motion detection settings so that wind, bugs, and light don’t set it off and send me a notification! Still playing with that but overall highly pleased with this purchase. You won’t regret it.",5,1,2019-9-19,1,0,0
"Hi, this little camera is great for inside the home. I got it as a gift from my parents due to moving into an apartment. I also have a curious dog who chews on things. I pretty much use it to spy on her in all reality here. The camera is easy to set up, has an adjustable height, and mounting tool (nothing fancy) if you’re into that option.The camera has an auto mode that switches over to the night mode when it’s dark so you don’t have to do it. Even though I received this as a gift, I’d buy more of them. It has a playback option. Isn’t that what you need when something goes wrong?",5,1,2019-2-23,1,0,1
"Would give this a better rating but about a month and a half later and the speaker is out. So we can no longer speak through it due to it being completely muffled. Otherwise we love the cam, was inexpensive, worked great up until this. We could keep an eye on our girls at any time, you can be out and it will catch any signs or movement or noise and immediately notifies you.",3,1,2018-9-5,1,1,0
"The camera works fine when it works which isn’t very often. Error code 0,27,...  most say restart app. If that doesn’t work restart camera, if that doesn’t work reboot router. I have initiated a replacement of the camera found out it is temperature sensitive. Keeps rebooting anything over 80 degrees. Should be good for 104. I'll see what happens.

This last set up (8 cameras) was for an elderly family member so we could check in on them and monitor what's going on in there house. Set up is a breeze.

"I really like this camera more than I expected. The only issue I’ve run into in the last 3-4 months was it continues to go offline. It goes offline even if there is not app update. I have to continuously reset it and sometimes that takes 3+ tries to complete the setup. Also, I noticed it skips time. I was looking for a section of my housekeepers in the kitchen and the video skipped and this camera focuses on the kitchen and living room.",4,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
was hesitant to get any kind of wireless camera since there are bad stories on many people hack in to them.  got it for my living room and set up was a breeze. nothing much to it. motion detection was good features. and you also can set rules to do certain things at certain time. like you can 5pm to 10pm to stop recording when you at home. prize is way cheaper than some of the other brands out there.,5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"I have bought multiple of these. At first, the cameras wouldn't let me connect. The cameras kept lagging and it would take forever to just view the live stream. I had to even turn off the live stream many times in order to get it to work. However, I got a wifi extender and connected all the cameras to it and the cameras stopped lagging. I would recommend this if you have good wifi. Maybe if you are getting a few of these cameras as I did then get a wifi extender.",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
We use this as a baby monitor and overall it works great for what we need.  My only complaint would be that I have to close and reopen the app every time my phone goes to sleep with the app running.  It is somewhat annoying but not a deal breaker for such an inexpensive alternative to a video monitor.,4,1,2018-10-18,1,2,0
"Product arrived with a large scratch and missing paint on the one side.  Interface is okay although you can only get a 12 second clip when there is movement....unless you purchase an upgrade of course.

"I decided to give this camera a try because Nest wanted another subscription when I moved one of my three Nest IQ (199.00) cams to another location in my home.  Well there is NO going back!  Good by Nest!  I still can't believe the quality of these little guys.  I would suggest spending 7 dollars more and getting the SD card.  It just makes the camera much more functional.

"Can't go wrong for the price. The app is a little ""kludgy"" and not exactly intuitive - especially on an iPad where the controls seem to end up spread out at almost every corner of the screen.I like the cloud storage, local SD storage option and the time lapse capabilities.

"Over the last 5 months I've purchased 14 cameras for the 2 properties I own.  Setting up the cameras with the app is quick and easy.  The HD picture quality is excellent, especially for the price of the camera.  The software app to view the cameras is good and I have to say over the last few months the manufacturer has made significant strides at updating and improving the software to make it more intuitive and easier to use.  The only minor negative comment I have is in a one week period of time, I'll have maybe one of fourteen cameras not respond to the software so I have to unplug it for a few seconds from the wall socket, plug it in again, and it starts working again immediately.  Overall, excellent security system for the price.",5,1,2018-5-2,1,1,0

"Great image and sound quality. But has two issues: (1) Keep troubling me with the connection failure. Have to unplug/plug the power cord. But will happen again after a few days. (2) The SD card worked for a while, but from some day, the camera did not recognize the card, even after resetting.",1,1,2018-3-25,1,3,1
I highly recommend these cameras. I had items stolen from my front and back porch on Memorial day when I was not home and decided I should buy a camera incase someone attempted to steal the larger more expensive items I keep on my back porch. It's great getting an alert to my phone whenever there is motion/sound and having the ability to view the camera live. I use this outdoors and keep it under an overhang without a case and it works great! Best $20 i've spent in years. 100% peace of mind.,5,1,2019-9-7,1,0,0

I am constantly getting errors on the app everything from no power to no internet, even though it has power and is connected to the internet according to the light on the back. I will get ""Events"" but when I try to watch what happened, the video never plays back it keeps loading then just shuts down. I have it set to record all day and when I watch the Playback it will show that the video was recorded but it will not play. I have tried multiple routers and even changed the channel that my wifi was on and nothing works. It is extremely frustrating.",1,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0
"Set up and everything was pretty easy. The quality of the videos aren't that great. I hate that it's only a 12 second clip if it detects sound/motion. Yes, it does keep recording 12 second clips but it misses a lot in between when it resets. What's the point of recording 12 seconds if it doesn't record the entire time there is motion. A lot can be missed. Going to send this back.",2,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
Excellent little camera for the price. Easy to mount and use. My only complaint is it has Google Home integration but it does not work very well - they need to do updates. It cannot stream directly to Google Home app all the time and only connects to Chromecast about 10% of the time. The app itself works great. Would recommend IF you don't care about the Google Home integration.,4,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"I own 3.  One of them records onto the SD card, but only ""all the time.""  The others don't record.  No setting, or swapping of memory cards, or firmware rollback, or anything will fix it.

I purchased this a while ago. I just used it for the first time today.  I purchased this because last holiday season a someone decided to steal my packages. I am hoping this camera is a deterrent l.

"Really surprised at the quality of the video, and how the delay is only just a split second. We use this to watch out cat when we leave for work, and its nice to be able to talk to him (if he starts getting into trouble lol). Odd that he can tell when we turn the app on to watch him, because he immediately looks up directly into the camera 🤔Also if you're worried about privacy or being ""spied on"" just unplug the camera when not in use. Really not worried about that tbh.",5,1,2019-5-11,1,0,0
"For some reason the camera linked up once to my phone. After dealing with customer service for over a week without any improvements, I gave up. $25 down the drain.

The picture also easily beats my Ring cameras, at a fraction of the price (although these do not have Ring's functionalities.) Set up truly takes only a few minutes. It's small, easy to adjust with an expanding base and long cord. Finally a camera designed to be easy to use and effective. And the price cannot be beat.",5,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0
Packaging is well designed. The camera can be placed on  a flat surface without extending the stand. I did not have to use the included metal disc and adhesive disc.  Setup and installation - 5 stars.  Motion triggered video recording works well but it appears the video clip is stored on the company's server.  I'd prefer the motion triggered videos can be routed to my own NAS drive via FTP.  Great value for this cam. Mostly likely I will purchase additional cam for my backyard.,5,1,2018-12-20,1,0,0
"Love this little camera - for the price it doesanawezome job, great service, expandable memory & more.  I love the fact that with a micro SD card you can see the events before & after a motion sensor trigger, share them & know what is going on.  I love this more than my Ring & for 1/8 the price!

So I wasn't expecting much from such a cheap wifi camera but I'm very impressed. this works so much better than the wifi NVR cameras that i also have up.

"Super handy for monitoring pets, etc. Wyze app is nice (outside of cyber security issues (CVEs), which they thankfully addressed), and best part is that it has 2-way audio.

"I have them to keep an eye on our small kids in different parts of the house. The only negative would be how difficult it is to search through the playback. You have one shot to pick a time and watch if you try to scroll to a different time, it takes too long to catch up and you end up watching the same footage time while hearing sound from the other time period. Then you need to go back out of the app and back in again. Hopefully, they can fix that in an update. This can be a problem if you want to just see who did what to whom during nap time when you have two kids sharing a room.

Overall this camera is amazing for the price.  I use them indoors to keep an eye on the pets and the quality is great. I have one that faces out back but the camera is inside of the house. The IR doesn’t work when the camera is placed on the inside of glass.  I just turned off the IR and depend on the motion lights for a better picture.  It’s very user friendly and easy to set up. The motion detection is great. I haven’t really seen too much of the night vision to offer an opinion but overall these cameras have served their purpose . For $25 it was well worth it! I did buy Micro sd cards for the cameras but haven’t had a chance to format them for install. You really should give them a try. Oh I also have the blink system for the outdoors and front of the house and honestly this is just as good!,5,1,2019-3-31,1,0,1
"So far so good. Even though this is indoor use only, I was able to point it to the front of my house from the window and it works well.  The image is decently clear.  I noticed with my porch light on, the night vision doesn't work as well.  If I turn off the night vision and leave the porch light on, it looks great.  The set up was very easy, I appreciate that.  The app isn't bad, my only complaint is it crashes on me every now and then, especially if I just have it up and watch it for about 5 minutes.  Besides that, so far it is pretty dependable.  I like the audio options as well as playback.  I added a 32GB MicroSD and it's good to go.",5,1,2018-3-6,1,0,0
"For those people who are wondering how these cameras work outside, they are great.I was pretty worried about the cameras failing during the -52 we had in Chicago but they didn’t fail once. They took the ice storm, the snow storms and the cold air without a problem. I have friends who replaced the nest cams with these and love them. Very impressed and highly recommend.",5,1,2019-1-12,1,1,0
"Best purchase I have ever made ! I needed something to Monitor my home ,Nothing fancy just something that I can use while I am at work and when my son comes home from school . Tried it out the first day ! And omgggggg ! The Quality on this thing for being price so cheaply is amazing! Picks up on every single movement in your home. You’re able to talk to the other person on the other side of that camera as well which is like the coolest thing. You’re able to take pictures etc. you’re able to adjust the settings on your camera advance mode... And the night vision on this little thing is hands-down the greatest!!! I will be purchasing a lot more in the coming days. This little thing gave me a piece of mine!",5,1,2019-10-13,1,0,1
This is a super great camera- great quality pics. But we wanted to install in a local nursing home and it will not allow us to do so because the wi-fi internet is open to everyone and does not require a password.  You cannot get the camera to set up unless you have a password for Wi-Fi for situations such as this. DIdn't work for us as we had hoped.,5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0

"being using the camera in garage for 2 months, always able to connect to it at home or outside, may take a few seconds more sometimes but never too long, motion detection works, saw some reviews about camera spying and recording even when in off mode, i guess that could be true but if you are using it to monitor unauthorized entry to your house and not pointing the camera at living room or bed room area to monitor your life, this product offers good value for its price.",5,1,2019-1-28,1,0,0
"I wasn't sure if this camera would meet what I was looking for, but it surely did.  I have the camera in a small barn that is about about 200 foot away from the wireless router to monitor the inside of the barn.The setup was straight forward and quick.  The image quality is pretty good, considering this is a $25 camera.

Now we know what are happening 24x7 like mail/package deliveries, trash pickups and even trespassings down to the minute and second.PROS : Easy to install.  High quality videos in both day or night.  Updated app is now easier to use and solve video loading issue.  No monthly fees with free 12-sec clips. Continuous or motion activated recording is available on micro SD card.  Playback is smooth.  The alerts are useful and customizable and the setup is easy.  Good viable low-cost alternative to popular Nest or Ring products.",5,1,2019-1-25,1,0,0
"Wyze would show in their marketing that it can be used to film anything happening outside as long as it is inside the house pointing out a window. True, it works that way but there are some major issues.Fist of all it will show the window reflection so you can't really make out much when it starts getting dark. Turning the camera on to night view makes it impossible to see anything.",3,1,2019-2-26,1,0,1

"Out of the box setup is simple. Worked great for a week or so, then wouldn't use or recognize I had a memory card installed, so constant recording didn't work. I have it pointed out my window, and I KNOW there is regular foot traffic going by, but it doesn't catch any of it. From ground level, max of 40 feet away. I moved patio furniture one day, it never recorded the motion. During daylight hours, from about 5 feet away.",1,1,2019-5-17,1,0,0
"The camera is awesome! Very tiny and easy to configure, however the motion sensor it's not that good, it does sense some things but some it does not, I do feel that it sense more light changing that people movement.The app also needs to be a bit easier to handle, it takes to much time to get use to it. The ""events"" it's hard to delete it, you have to do it one by one, I thing it should have an option to selecto all of them, or multiples and delete",5,1,2019-3-27,1,0,0
I’m definitely ordering several more of these cameras for around my house. They are so easy to install. The camera quality is great. I previously purchased it for my sons crib. I get notifications on my phone for movement he has in his crib. I highly recommended this camera.,5,1,2019-12-4,1,1,0

"I have a variety of cameras around the house, but this one is about the cheapest, yet one of the best.

"This product is NOT WIRELESS.  Product sells itself as wireless but product description notes that it must be ""powered up"" in order to work.  The device must be plugged in to be powered up--if it's not plugged in, it will turn off.  The cord used to plug in and power up--made of wires!  Therefore, this product is NOT WIRELESS.

Not sure why others have a bad taste in their mouth about this camera. This camera is pretty killer for $25. I have a handicap pup at home and I purchased this Cam to be able to check on her. I love the picture quality and the ability to speak through the Cam. Setup was super easy. It 1080 quality and pretty freaken awesome. I will be buying more for the other rooms in the house. Definitely would recommend to anyone who is interested in buying one.,5,1,2019-2-20,1,0,0
"Added this wifi camera and was easy to set up. It lost some functionality after a month when the two way sound stopped working.  Current updates didn't help. Since then the app sometimes won't validate your connection when other brands of wifi cams on the same network will connect easily.  One good thing is if you put a memory card in it, the camera will save several days of footage.",2,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"Bought this merely for the price and and the great reviews, but highly disappointed. The motion sensor in this is VERY useful. If there are lightning flashes, dust particles kicking off, AC turning on and off etc.. will trigger the motion sensor. Which defeats the purpose of this. I don't want notifications in the middle of the night when my AC kicks on. It gets two stars just because of the quality of the picture compared to its price.Yes I can disable that setting but whats the point. My recommendation is invest in a better camera.",2,1,2019-6-25,1,1,0
"I wish these were available before I purchased my Arlo Pro 2 setup.  For $20, you cannot really lose.  For outdoor use you can add a secondary market enclosure for pretty cheap.  The audio quality is better than NEST for zero cost after initial purchase (cheaper price as well).  The free cloud recording is a definite plus.  All in all probably the best bang for the buck for home security/monitoring cameras.  Heck, even if they only last a year or two you have only wasted $20. Much better than the $200 for similar cameras.  Highly recommended.",5,1,2018-5-23,1,0,0
"Super easy to install.  Very compact and versatile.  Great picture quality even at SD vs HD setting.  Excellent motion detection - it even detected a small cat!  I used one camera pointed out a front window to the porch to act as a ""doorbell"" camera.  I used one for the back door.  I also used one for the garage door - and the magnetic base made it a 5 second install!Only one thing I would like to see improved -  Less sensitivity to light vs motion for motion detection.  Every time a light goes off or on in a room an event recording is triggered.",5,1,2019-1-17,1,0,0

By the time we manage to get the app to load the feed, it's been so long that it's pointless. They are cheap for a reason!",1,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"We are quite happy with this camera.  We use it as a baby monitor.  Setting up the monitoring is kind of confusing, and I'm still not sure how to achieve certain things.  Integration with our Google Home Hub (or Nest Hub?) is VERY nice, though not 100% reliable and suffers a 20+ second delay.  The magnetic mount made it super simple to attach to a vent in our son;s room.  But considering the alternatives and the value for our money, I still highly recommend this!

The reviews from other consumers and review companies were glowing. The product concept, packaging and value proposition are very appealing.However, i cannot recommend this product to friends at this point since the camera speaker that I received seemed defective - sound only comes out as static. It records fine, but I can’t communicate to it, which to me was the most important use case while people deliver packages or ring our doorbell while we are  not home. It seems that based on other comments I’ve read online other people have the same problem.",2,1,2018-12-8,1,0,0

I've had zero issues with connection or the app so far. Similar products would easily go for +$100 at best buy. So yes, it is definitely worth every single penny.",5,1,2019-4-16,1,0,1
"Great product. Close to excellent/perfect. My only issue is that if you don't have the setting way up and it detects a person, it won't continually record.

"Magnet would not support camera on vertical surface.  But white duct tape does. Suggest  using a 10 foot connection not the 6ft which comes with it.  easy setup. good quality pix. likely will get second cam & daisy chain together.  using on front porch of 100+ year old house; see which cat just came up the steps and who just backed in to the drive.  Very useful, good price. good value.  recommend getting the mini 32 GB memory chip.",5,1,2019-3-26,1,0,0
This camera is great. I brag about it all the time. I was looking for a nest or Logitech to go with my HomeKit but opted to try this out because of the price and reviews. It is awesome. Picture is great. Size is great. Features are great. And I don’t have to pay a subscription to watch old clips or notifications. U can use a SD card and it will record to it so you can watch video up to 16 days continuously (32gb). I’m glad I bought this instead of the others. U can even us a portable battery like u use to charge phone and put it anywhere if you don’t have a wall or usb plug. Can’t say enough good things about it.,5,1,2018-1-12,1,1,0
"Ordered 2 of these.  The quality of the image on live streaming on the app is great.  You can finger zoom into the streaming image on the app, which is pretty darn cool.  VERY easy to install app & set up cameras. Easy to 'share' camera views on 2 phones as well.  The talk button does give somewhat of a delay and sometimes crackles, but I couldnt believe for $25 there was sound OR a talk button to begin with!",5,1,2018-5-30,1,2,0
"Pretty disappointed, day time vision with the v2 is good.  Motion detection is a 5 out of 10 . I walked by the camera 12 feet away it missed me 5 out of 10 times.  NIGHT VISION IS TOTAL GARBAGE.  My 720p ring has WAY BETTER NIGHT VISION then this camera.  Sitting in my window at night it picks up on it's own light and shows nothing but some that looks like spot lights.  I can walk 5 feet away and you cannot see me.",1,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"Great toy to play around with for the price; too bad they dropped their complimentary motion detection shortly after purchasing the product.

"Had an amcrest that drives me crazy (klunky interface, produces videos in a weird format, etc) so was pleasantly surprised in the easy peasy set up of this camera.  Quick and simple, then linking it to Alexa was again totally painless.  Now I just say to Alexa show garage and presto, its on my echo show.  Oh if only all things technical were this easy and painless.",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"Wyze products are incredibly user-friendly, and these cameras are no different. Very easy to install using the app, as well as the easy physical installation indoors.

I highly recommend if you want an affordable camera system without any monthly fees.",5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"In addition to being slow and glitchy the company has updated their terms of service and said that I can't use the 10 cameras under the terms I purchased them under.

"It won't even connect to my WiFi network when other smart devices can. Wyze and this little pig of a camera want desperately to be on the same band as your paramount laptop, computer, and mobile devices. In this way they can sniff traffic and phone home. Don't be fooled by the price. There's a reason why these little cameras are so much cheaper than all the rest. They love nothing more than to spy on you and report back to their parents in China.",1,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0

"love these cameras. bought 2 to keep an eye on my dogs and my garage. easy to setup, good image quality, the only negative is that you can only access them via the app on your phone. it works well, but would be nice to access it on your computer via a webpage.still had to give it 5 stars because it is such a good camera and the price is incredible. plus free 14 day rolling cloud storage. you can get 6-8 of these cameras for what 1 of the similar cameras cost. if they add web access, and maybe Alexa intergration, they would put the other guys to shame.",5,1,2018-3-21,1,0,0
"Pretty amazed with these cameras! Bought some for my aunt, then liked them so much and my other uncle wanted some. Then my in-laws also bought them.Pros: best part is that you can view live from your phone and that they will store 14 days worth of ONLY motion and\or sound detection, it will not store full length videos FYI.",5,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"It would have been a great camera, but it locked up a brand new 32GB micro sd card. The SD card is now “write protected” with no way to turn it off. The camera, my pc, and any other device can’t save or edit files on the card. After a quick web search I found others have had the same issue. Considering the card cost half the price of the camera, I am disappointed.",2,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"I ordered the ""deal of the day"" it was to contain 2 cameras and an SD card, however I only received ONE camera and an SD card! So far the camera is OK, it is not very good at alerting you even though I have the sensitivity on 100, the sound is horrible, don't even bother using the microphone just sounds like a bunch of garbled crap.",1,1,2018-12-14,1,1,0
Not reliable. My two cameras started rebooting constantly after 4 months. They do their job when they work but apparently they dont last. This has become a nightmare at night when they costantly keep making that clicking sound when rebooting. Do not recomend this cameras. Cheap hardware. Will break soon.,2,1,2019-4-6,1,1,0
Great camera for 20 bucks. At 26 it’s decent. They recently did some upgrades to the software but it’s still best used for an indoor camera with motion detection or a garage camera. No motion zone range limit like ring that I can find which makes it hard to use outside facing a public street. Wish it had the ability to stream to network and your preferred cloud storage but you only get sd card and their free storage right now. But it is free 14 day motion event storage I believe.,4,1,2019-1-9,1,0,0
"This wyze camera is very high quality for the price. This is the 3rd one I've bought and it works great. Only downfall is the two way talk isn't the greatest. You can usually hear what you're saying from the camera, but cant understand what the cameras microphone is saying when on the app. You also will need a micro sd card if you want the 24/7 playback. But considering the price and the quality otherwise, I think this is a great deal.",4,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"You can't beat this camera for the money, and it may rival many much more expensive ones. Couple it with a motion-activated floodlight ($15-20- it should trigger an alert when the light comes on) and you should have a budget Ring- normally which sells for around $200. One weak point- they had pixel-comparison software which was ""rented"" to identify humans. The company ended the agreement so Wyze now has to develop their own recognition software. Also  if you want to mount the cam outdoors, you'll need a case- at present they have no outdoor model. My advice: Buy this cam, you won't be disappointed.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"This camera is really nice, and well made. The video looks great, and I especially like the magnet integrated into the base... However, I could not get it to stream to my Google hub Max.

The company is amazing in itself!I had a few issues with the cameras I received but the company is really amazing and notified me of one issue immediately and replaced 2 of my cameras when I found out the other one had the same issue! The product is great! I just had a bad batch but overall the company itself will have your back and help you out! Definitely the camera system I will stick with!  All cameras work perfect now! I wanted to let people know to just check all settings and features to make sure they work properly but they will honor your purchase!,5,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0
"The camera is small, but it sure is a powerhouse. Setup right out of the box took about 15 min including downloading the app. Between the directions contained in the box and the app, setup was easy. The photos attached show my back door with light on and off. The sound on the camera also works flawlessly. Totally impressed with the size, ease of setup, night vision and picture quality. Wyze, you did a great job!",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,1

These cameras work well. I have three of these and two of the pan cameras. I have all of them set on continuous recording using 32gigs sd cards in each camera. I have only had one issue with one camera recognizing the sad card. All you have to do is reformat the sd card it’ll recognize it. The Wyze app is nice and pulls up the cameras live feed quickly.

We use this as a baby cam in our nursery! This camera is way way better than the baby cameras friends have bought for 5X the cost. The one thing I would say is there are four tiny red dots on the face of the camera when in use and if this is in the eyeline of your baby this might be distracting for sleep. We noticed the baby looking straight at the camera so we moved it to a more discreet place.,5,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0
This camera takes too long to view  playback.  You have to scroll timecode with your finger.  Each swipe required more buffering.  The only good thing is that it can record small video clips which don't take long to load.  But these clips are triggered by motion; but this device has a poor motion sensor.  People will walk by and sometimes it won't trigger motion sensor.  There should be an easier way to type in time code to view that particular section.,2,1,2019-1-3,1,0,0
"NOT WIRELESS!!!!!!!!  Sure, wireless Wi-Fi. But the device itself is not wireless. Beyond disappointed! I thought I was purchasing a wireless device. Very disappointed! Also took forever to set up even when it was plugged in.  Kept giving me network errors even though I knew my network was working just fine.  Was working on all my other devices just fine including the device I was trying to set this up on in the first place.",1,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
For the life of me it seems like I either have a dud camera or something is wrong - my motion sense is not working.  I am lucky that it is not the primary reason I bought the camera but it still never alerts me when there is anything detected nor records any events to the SD card.  LIVE view words amazingly well.

Easy to set up, great software interface and works as advertised.  I set mine up showing a view of the main entry way, so it gives me both security and a chance to check on the local weather when I'm away.  And it relays sound both ways too!  With a micro SD you can record or take pictures if you want to.  Just a beautifully engineered product and so cheap you may as well monitor anything - my neighbors check on their chickens!",5,1,2019-3-8,1,0,0
I bought this to test out because my family needed indoor cameras. I have the Ring doorbell and stick up camera man did i waste money. I could have bought 5 of these for the same price image quality is good and I love the microSD card slot. Very easy set up and so far the app is quick to load the images.,5,1,2019-8-20,1,1,0
"Camera is great!! Clear camera which works great for its price. Although it feels creepy like someone is watching me and my family even when the camera is off. About a week ago i heard a some noise coming through from the mic in the camera which scared the crap out of me. It sounded like someone coughed really loud. So it leads me to believe that someone could be watching or spying on me. I now have the camera turned off and pointed to the ceiling when we are home. Whenever I'm not home, that's when I turn it back on. The motion detector and night vision is another great thing about the camera. There is no lag in real time view. I would give this a 5 star but it's strange that other people think they're being watched too. People think that this product is cheap because China uses this to spy on us? Lol funny but not funny. If you dont feel comfortable with people watching you then it's best to use it as an outside camera where you wont have to worry about someone watching you walk in your own home naked lol",4,1,2019-2-16,1,0,0
"****EDIT*** rating change to five stars!!! The issues I was previously having were corrected by both Amazon and Wyze support team was willing to help as well.

I initially thought this was a good camera that had decent daytime video quality but as time went on the camera spends more time off line not working than on. There was an update to make it more mesh network friendly but it still works like trash even with a wifi booster puck in the same room that my Nest Hello doorbell easily connects to.

"Echoing what others report -- for $20, it's a serious value proposition.  Set up was remarkably easy (I used their YouTube installation video for guidance) and it works very nicely.

But I believe those additional functionalities will materialize soon.",4,1,2017-12-16,1,1,0

This camera is a great alternative to ring. Our Wyze sits inside (I believe it can be outside) in the windowsill facing out towards our front door and patio. It’s small and white so it blends in. No one can just rip it off your house and steal it since this device can be inside which means no losing your footage. It does have a magnetic bottom so you can attach it in multiple ways. It always lets me know when someone comes to the front door and the vision is incredibly clear. We got a memory card for ours so it always records when the motion sensor is activated and highly recommend doing that. They are cheap too if you buy off brand. Overall great security camera with all the features we need,5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
This camera is amazing for the price. Records nice can control it through the app easily. The only small issue I have is that when going through the playback when a sd card is inserted is that I can’t just fast forward and watch throughout I have to drag my finger across and miss what I was trying to see and have to go back and forth to find the exact moment.,5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,1

"Such a cute devise and great picture quality, motion detection, etc. But I seem to be having the issue others mentioned of too far from router, perhaps, because it constantly has to reconnect. Also, it's far more difficult to FIND the moments I'm looking for in playback than I had hoped. Doesn't seem to have a fast-forward, frame type of option so I end up scrolling and then just waiting in real time playback for what I hope to see. And by the way, if it IS the router distance, although our router is on the opposite end of the house from where I want this to be, our house is small and it's really only about the equivalent of two rooms away. Easy setup and great potential but not working out well for me.",2,1,2019-4-26,1,0,0
"For the price you cant beat this camera for indoor use. I have other makes of wireless cameras and none of them had the audio recording capability. Not to mention you can talk through the camera.

Even if you silence the motion alerts you will still get a smoke/carbon detector alarm alert. This thing also holds a good size sd card like 128gb I  think. You really wont find a better choice.

I am amazed at the quality of image you get out of this little cube.  Not only does it work well but it is quite attractive and very small.  The software is easy to use with lots of great capability.  You can store images either in the cloud or on a micro SD card.  It even works fairly well through glass as long as you avoid reflections from interior lighting.  A great choice for video security.,5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0

It was super easy to set up and I have had no issues with it once set up. My only complaint is that when you open the app you get a preview image that is a still shot gathered recently when you last accessed the app. Since this is my only camera, it's not too big of a deal to click on that camera to get a live feed (which takes just a few seconds). If you are looking to open the app and see a live feed of multiple cameras at once I wouldn't recommend this camera.",4,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0

It does everything it says and works as well as the more expensive cameras I've bought.  It's not the prettiest, but who cares really if it looks like a box?

It was semi-difficult to connect as apparently it’s not compatible with our main wifi network so make sure to look at that before purchasing, but luckily it connects to our other wifi line just fine.The only issue I have is that the camera has trouble distinguishing between night and day, so it’s almost always in night mode when I log into the app. Not an issue for us, but might be annoying if you’re using it for home security and want the picture to be in color most of the time. We have floor to ceiling windows so it’s definitely not a brightness issue. Otherwise, I love this little camera!! Will be purchasing more.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,1
"DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT! Use an SD card with pre-existing data, it WILL be lost! I used my SD card for my nintendo switch as a temporary one until I could get a dedicated one as I wasn't playing my switch recently. Went to use it again in the switch and all the files were missing. Over all the camera is great, but a warning that the SD card will be wiped would be great. Now I have to redownload and move all my game back over. Very disappointed.",4,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0
"I purchased this after purchasing the Wyze Cam Pan.  This powered on based on the rear LED, but it wouldn't go through set up. I tried reflashing the firmware, this didn't work either.  I gave up and returned it to Amazon. I was not going to try and contact Wyze for support; my attempt at support for my Cam Pan was fruitless, eleven days and counting with no response.  So if you like buying innovative products that may or not work out of the box and you like being your own support relying on customer forums then go for it.  But if you have a major problem with the product don't expect timely support.",1,1,2019-1-22,1,1,0
"This is a great camera.. disregard all the negative reviews. Let's be honest its not a expensive camera so you should put your expectations at a 25 dollar camera and it exceeds that by far. And to go further I also own a few of the 100 dollar cameras from other security companies and they dont offer 2 way talk they dont offer free storage and everyone's version of 1080p is not the same. This cam offers great picture great sound 2 way talking online storage easy set up and motion sensor for 25 dollars. And they offer a better cam for less then 10 dollars more that provides motion tracking and 360 pan. They say you get what you pay for but these cameras offer way more for your buck. So dont let these negative reviews turn you away from a great product I actually own 6, 2 of the 25 dollar cameras and 4 pan cams and I love them",5,1,2018-12-30,1,0,0
"I bought this because of the price and I had a need for a motion detection camera. The motion detection is great!  The sound cuts in and out quite a bit, especially the longer you watch.  And my biggest problem is the night vision is not working. The app is a little confusing. I'm trying to figure out how to stop recording from going on while I'm home.  I do really like it for the price and for what I need it for.",4,1,2019-4-8,1,0,0

The magnet feature is awesome and they provide you with a sticker for the steel plate to mag to, plus all the power connections.",2,1,2019-5-8,1,1,0
"I’ve had great luck with this camera. I did not write it for night vision, because I have it in a lighted area outside. I also don’t have the motion detection notifications turned on.It does function very well. It’s easy to set up. I have more than one of these and I’ve bought them and giving them away as gifts. They are fantastic",5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"It records for12 seconds when motion is detected, but it doesn’t record all the motions! For example, it records a person going to my porch, he can stand there for a minute or so(out of camera view), but when the person leaves there is no 12 seconds to show that! It was motion, but it didn’t record it. So I purchased a card for this, and camera started to load very slow! It have been making clicking noises every 30 seconds or so! So annoying! My internet is good, searched troubleshooting, but couldn’t figure out why this is happening. Looking for a new camera now. This is not worth it!",1,1,2020-10-5,1,0,0
"Great indoor security camera for such a low price (about $30). Recommended by neighbor for outside our condo door in our floor's lobby. Small, easy to setup and install since our neighbor had already figured how to connect to electrical power (used light socket adapter to plug in). WYZE phone app is fairly easy to use.

I had the noise sensor on at first, but it kept recording and there was nothing there, so I turned that off.It was very easy to set up. I love the versatility of it. It has a magnet base and the camera portion twists around to almost any angle. I don't think I have any complaints.",5,1,2019-11-17,1,0,1

Great for watching my kids downstairs doing homework. I can listen to them or tell at them. Sometimes I watch my driveway and watch the neighborhood hooligans throw rocks at eachother and my truck. It's good. Buy one!,5,1,2020-9-5,1,1,0
I decided I needed a camera for the front of my home when some of my packages weren’t arriving when marked delivered. I live right by a club so we get a lot of sketchy people sometimes in the late hours. I needed this with just the purpose to leave it from the inside of my home looking out the window  I am pretty impressed at the service this product has provided given in mind that I felt it was very affordable. I just ordered a 32gb SD Card so that I can playback footage. Even without the SD Card I still get notifications when someone passed in front and it shows me a recording of it but if I needed to review the entire feed I needed the SD Card. But overall this is good quality for a the price you pay. I’m considering getting a second camera ! Also side note: I bought a WiFi extender because my connection was not good (I have a really old router and very basic internet) but knowing this ahead of time I was able to setup a great connection with my extended. So make sure you have good connection whenever you intend to place your camera.,5,1,2019-3-9,1,0,0
"Camera would not stay connected to WiFi, when I would reset the camera it would repeat ready over and over again. Rest my modem did not work. Tried several times final when it did connect said network was unstable I have several cameras around my house they all connected with no problem. I returned it and got my money back. This camera had a lot of good reviews I should have guessed with the 25.00 price and certainly didn’t want to connect to Alexa . And the app is really terrible.",1,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0

"I bought this for my garage and it seems to do what it's supposed to do, but it still notifies the sound detection even after I disabled it.

This actually worked out pretty well for us. Recommend by a friend. I can now watch our pup while my fiancé & I were both at work. We also wanted to ease him out of his crate. So we would leave him out of it & go to the store and be able to watch him. It ended up being a life saver for my anxiety. Great price for what I needed it for & I can talk to him through it too. App is super easy to use on an iPhone or android.,5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"I wish I could have given this a better rating because I like this camera. For the price, it's a good value. However, while it seems to detect motion and sound, it is not reliable for sending a notification to your phone. At times, it will send a  notification immediately, other times it might send the notification in 5 minutes, an hour later or never send a notice. I will probably keep it hooked up but I will buy another, more reliable camera.",4,1,2019-8-17,1,0,0
"Wow, this thing is amazing!  The product was inexpensive and it does exactly what is advertised!  In fact, It does virtually the same thing (audio, streaming video, pictures, motion detector, etc) as those expensive models.  And it's so very easy to use.  I also like that they have several YouTube videos online with tips.  Great product!I'm going to buy another and I've already convinced my family to purchase as well.",5,1,2018-1-13,1,1,0
"Just received today and got set up in our guest room so we could keep tabs on our pup while we are away at times. Image quality is nice, app is user friendly. Audio quality is okay, as compared to the Nest (we have 2 outdoor cams and the audio quality is better). So far so good, would recommend, and for $25 each we will probably buy a couple more!Will come back and edit review if anything changes.",5,1,2018-12-27,1,1,0
Best bang for your buck cameras on the market. No monthly fee for cloud recording. Additional storage via memory card. And they go just about anywhere.If pointing them outdoors thru a window just be aware that you’ll have to turn off night vision otherwise it’ll go into an endless loop of switching on and off when it sees its reflection in the window.,5,1,2019-2-25,1,1,0
"We use the camera for home security, and position it unobtrusively in a front window facing the driveway. The alert zone feature works great, but I haven't yet figured out how to make the time lapse function record and play back. The only negative is that there isn't a Wyze viewing portal on the Web that enables all the controls and functions, but there is a way to set-up the camera to view the live output using RTSP.",5,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"Cam Pan is a little more expensive by Wyze but quality definitely shows. I initially bought this piece because i didn't need to pan around in my spare garage but the night vision on this is terrible.

I had originally used my pan cam on this area and difference in quality is night and day.",3,1,2020-7-2,1,1,0
I have three of these.  However the first batch all lost sound capabilities after a few weeks.  Worked with customer service to troubleshoot and couldn't get the problem fixed so they sent me three new ones.  The new ones are working great!

The reviews on this camera were 50/50 but after purchasing this device I must say it is great so far.. Super picture Quality.. No problem with connection..Someone had said it didn't work with 5g.but it does..All I wanted to do was see my Aquariums when away from home and it more than does the job.. Haven't added SD CARD yet for that feature but I'm sure it will do good there also.. 5 stars so far.. I'm gonna get 2x more do the house.. I love it 👍...,5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0

"Disappointed in these cameras. Setup was very easy and picture quality good. However motion detection and alerting is proving to be unreliable.

Too unreliable to be tasked with that job",3,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
"There's no point in owning this cam, because the stream you view on the app only works about 30% of the time. Then the times it actually works, it tends to freeze after a few seconds of use.I've reset it several times. Doesn't seem to help. My internet connection is pretty good and I use a good router.

So far im pretty disapointed. The reason i bought this camera its because it was supouse to be compatible with alexa echo show. So far its doesnt want to work. it makes a loading to just say the camera isn't responding. :/ im a little annoyed. I read some blogs of people talking that the camera used to work with their echoes but not anymore. I would like a refound if theres is no fix to this yet.,1,1,2019-1-2,1,1,0
2 of the 3 cameras that I am using have been working great.  Saving vudeos and adjusting detection area for motion is pretty easy.  The video is pretty clear and the night vision works well.  The magnetic mounting is really nice.  makes fine adjustment to the position a breeze.  I use command strips instead of the double sided tape on the metal mounting plate for additional poitional adjustment.Unfortunately one of the cameras need to be reset on a very regular basis and often it takes unplugging it and plugging it back in to get it working again.  I will be getting with customer support as soon as I get a chance.,4,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0

I am a single mom of two teens and I don't live in the best area. I like to be able to keep an eye on my house and it's surroundings and this camera does just that. The record time is amazing as is the picture quality. I love the fact that my son can tell me someone is knocking at the door and I can see who it is while I'm at work and even talk to them if I want to.  This is exactly what I was  looking for and so much so I now own two. Def get the add on mini SD card that amazon offers and it will save some cash.,5,1,2019-1-9,1,0,0
Absolutely terrible! With every update these get worse and worse. They are glitchy and don't record major events happening right in front of them. I have had them for a right around a year and I can say with out a doubt these are hot garbage. Update 9.30.2020It just gets worse! Now they require you to pay for basic features at the originally came with. Avoid this brand.,1,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"Great affordable camera. If you don't sign up for their services some useful functionality is gone, but its still generally useful and does the job I need it to without signing up.

Honestly I didn't have much expectations for the price. I previously bought a much more expensive one and it didn't work at all so I decided to try this because the reviews were good. Well its awesome. The app is super easy to use although I wish there were a widget to turn it on and off. The motion detection is a little bit too good. Any light will set it off. I wish the playback offered a timelapse but it's not too terrible. Definitely worth it,5,1,2019-4-11,1,0,0

"Good concept at a shockingly low price but the system has limited uses and you will be making sacrifices to make it work for your situation.  The very limited record time, 12 seconds without adding an SD card and only able to begin recording again after 5 minutes has to be reconsidered by this manufacturer.  You might catch the thief just entering your foyer but after 12 seconds the theif will have free reign to your stuff for 4 to 5 minutes with out any recording.

I would like to see options for longer clips than 12 sec or shorter lags between clips.  The app shows a free trial for that but it doesn't want to work with this camera (or my phone?).

Keeps ruining micro sd cards.  It is very frustrating. I bought 2 of these because I didn't want a camera that required a subscription so I got 2 of these and bought top quality micro sd cards. After a while it said micro sd card was not available. I scanned the forums for micro sd cards that worked with them. bought 5 more micro sd cards. Same problem. such a shame.,1,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"Use for real-time peeking at my kids when they're in the playroom and I'm on Netflix in the other room. Also, I may or may not need to talk to my dog during the day, and because he's ""not a real service animal"" just because I miss him, I can't bring him to work. With this camera, however, I CAN SPEAK TO HIM DURING THE DAY - he can hear me.Truly easy peasy lemon squeezy. Get this camera as a baby monitor, husband monitor, pet monitor, whatever you want to easily watch from afar, no judgment, it's a free country.",5,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
Great product! The features are very useful. The picture quality is very clear. I can even hear and speak through the camera remotely when I am away from home. The features are very similar to my Arlo Camera except my Arlo does not even record sound and I paid $150 for it. It is an amazing camera especially for the price. I will be buying more to add to my home they are great For both indoor and outdoor use!,4,1,2019-6-27,1,0,0
"The first one I rcv'ed refused to record to the SDcard.  I tried multiple SDcards. Did the firmware update, downgrade, etc.  Was with their tech support multiple times.  The cam didn't work as expected.  Amazon did an exchange.  Then 2nd cam - would record to the SDcard.  However the 2nd cam would reboot every so often so it was very unreliable.  Both cams had various things not working. End up returning both for a refund from Amazon.  Also this was the V2 version of the cam",1,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"Pros: Works very well, the app is great, easy to set up and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a low-cost security camera. I like the way it posts a 5-second video clip in the alert and if you want to see more you can go and view on your phone app.The only thing I wish for this is that they make an outdoor version camera were security is needed more and also a way to wifi download the footage onto a hard drive. Currently, it has an SD card that you have to climb up and get it out if you want to save the footage.",5,1,2019-4-13,1,0,0
"It will spy on you. If you make a quick research you will read it everywhere. Honestly a bit disappointing that this product is being sold here.

I'm little bit disappointed. This camera need a very strong internet speed and very low ping to make this camera useful if ur using it outside the USA . I'm using it with a connection of 30MB connection speed and and its 3 feet away from my wifi and its disconnect all the time and you can't make ur job done ..hey wyze you need to start consider  the rest of the world and start making this camera at least operated over wifi only if SD card installed..,3,1,2019-9-6,1,1,0
"We are often taught in life that if something sounds too good to be true, it often is. Well with Wyze, that's not the case. These cameras are packed full of features, extremely reliable, compact, and best of all they are ridiculously cheap! I don't know how they manage to sell these at such a low price, but I am grateful. I have multiple of these mounted outside of my house and they have never failed me. Picture quality is perfect, and the night vision is great. Thank you Wyze.",5,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0
"This is a great camera. It's small, so it's easy to place strategicly, it does great at picking up motion and alerting me on my phone. The picture quality is great, even in SD.

"I'm using mine outside to monitor my front door on a covered patio. (Yes, they did just announce the real outdoor camera.) It works great so far. Although, I get a lot of false notifications on windy days where tree shadows are blowing or sunlight comes and goes behind clouds. The beta person detection seems to work well too. I bought this as an entry into home security and I'm pleased.",4,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"Easy to use and set up. However, in order to get the picture right side up, the camera has to be positioned upside down. So I guess its better mounted on a ceiling or something. Also, it doesn't capture full motion. It'll record someone walking one way, but not when they come back through. And hearing sound comming from the end that's recording is good. But to speak through the camera is no good. Audio is broken up and unclear (or glitchy in my children's words). It is also doesnt always allow viewing remotely. Overall, for the money, it's not a bad purchase. If these issues were fixed I would rate it much higher.",3,1,2018-12-6,1,1,0

"""You get what you pay for"" really stands out here. Except I don't even think this sad little camera is worth the $25 I paid. Delay is a pathetic 25 seconds on SD, didn't even bother testing the HD, and that's on a strong WiFi signal. The speaker on this pathetic device is sounds like it is processed and fed through a dozen tin cans.Easiest return of my life.",1,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0

They 2 day shipped me another one that has worked great. That was awesome customer service . Pics up sound from far away. The motion sensor is able to be customized in an area and lower sensitivity to avoid ""Shadow Motion"" alarms. You cant go wrong with this camera!",5,1,2018-12-20,1,1,0
"I set it up inside, but pointed the camera outside. It has a wide enough angle to get my driveway and front porch. It has a great feature to narrow down the window for motion detection. Since i live on a fairly busy corner, i didnt want to get a notification every time a car drove by.  For the price, this is an amzing little camera. The night vision works great, but since i have it set up to record thru a window, sometimes there is a glare from the night vision. It just took time to find the correct positioning in the window.Do yourself a favor, and spend the extra $13 on the SD card. The sd card allows you much better video quality, and the ability to store days worth of videos.

"These are great, cheap little cameras. I really wish you could record straight to a NAS or at least increase the 12 second cloud storage option.

I do wish the auto record (motion or sound) would last longer than 12 seconds. When I first got it the auto recording time was 7 seconds, so it has improved a bit in that sense.

"Great little camera for the money! I've wanted a security camera in the house, but wanted something I could expand, and didn't want to spend a lot of money or deal with wiring. This fit the bill. The image is surprising quality. I have a much more expensive rig at work, and could never get the quality of images I get from this camera. Cell phone quality, and even night vision is exceptional. You can stick the little thing anywhere you can run the long USB cord to, and move it around as you like. Setup was a breeze, and I've scared my pets more than once by speaking to them through the camera's small speaker. I now have a couple of these, and it's easy to flip between cameras in the app.Cons: The speaker sounds horrible, and while it's gotten better, there's still enough lag that you wouldn't want to use it as an intercom. If you want to tell crooks to get out of your house, it would work great.",5,1,2018-2-22,1,0,0
Absolute best camera avalible for the money. Picture quality and motion tracking is great. The night vision/infrared could be a little better but are still decent quality. The set-up processes was difficult but it could have been caused by my phone (connection set-up timed out several times). The user interface and app are great. You can easily zoom in on objects during the live view without losing much picture quality. The intercom function works well enough. You just need to hold the talk button for a second before you start talking and continue to hold for a second after to insure a complete message. I will be buying several more of these.,4,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0

It probably took me less than 10 minutes, and with the phone app I get notifications every time a person is at the door.

You don’t really need an sd card to record it for you plus you can save the videos too!!

It's ok but nothing special. No matter how I set it up when it detects motion it only records a 12 second clip. Yes it does have a clear picture but it has that rounded fish bowl appearance instead of a nice squared edge. I think it only works with the Alexa Show and not the Alexa Echo because I tried to turn it on with my Alexa Echo Dot and it didn't work. I won't buy another one.

I purchased wyze because I follow the owner and saw him promoting it. I did some research and purchased this one and the planning one and I couldn't be happier. The quality of the video and motion tracking is so good. I was pleasantly surprised with the app and the ease of it. The response time for different actions such as panning in the other model are on point with little delay. I have already recommended it to several coworkers and they have made a purchase as well!,5,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"When something looks too good to be true... I needed it for my office in a small space for limited use. I was able to install it (not without some challenges) but then a month later it stopped working when updates were made to our wi fi network. I spent HOURS trying to reconfigure it, going through numerous posts of other frustrated buyers. The company behind this encourages you to contact their support. I tried several times but to no avail. $25 of junk. Save yourself the trouble and but something better.",1,1,2019-3-6,1,0,0
Hook it up to a power bank and you can hide it better or put it in a place where theres no outlit. Im enjoying the feel of safety. The wife and I have roommstes and we were worried they were stealing money from our bedroom well now we set a trap and wait,5,1,2019-12-6,1,2,0
The camera worked for a little bit and I tried to update the firmware but didn't work so I left it alone. Now the system just reboots all day long and the app can't connect to the device.

"Linking the Wyze account with Alexa was very easy however when telling Alexa to show me the camera it times out. I’ve tried it using a Echo Show 8 and two Echo Show 5. The camera’s wifi signal is 99%.Also, I purchased this camera to monitor my baby at night using my Alexa Show 5, however, it seems like (in the case It did showed me the cam feed) the video monitor would last for only 10 minutes. 10 minutes?",1,1,2019-12-28,1,1,0
"Wyze brand is absolutely amazing! They are worth way more than what we are paying for them. This company is so amazing, they are going to take over the camera industry! These cameras are better than our more expensive camera systems.",5,1,2019-6-8,1,1,0
LOVE! Ok you should know that setting up any tech item is my least favorite thing to do - but THIS!! So simple to set up - literally 5 minutes from box to working with my phone! I just ordered an Alexa to add to it (currently viewing from iPhone) so pray for me on that one. But the camera is perfect - so inexpensive but does everything you need - the night viewing actually works great and the magnetic mount is so simple. My only issue is if I want to relocate it I have already used the sticky piece...but I’m sure I can find a work around.,5,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0
"What a piece of junk! Was able to set up, used for 5 minutes and tried to add another phone so my wife could view. No I can’t get it working on any device. Did factory set and all trouble shooting steps. What a waste of money.",1,1,2020-7-26,1,1,0
Great product but the best part about it is that this camera has no fees to access feed online.  It has some free cloud storage but that is only for 15-second clips which works great but you should get an sd card to look at something beyond that clip.  The clips are great for notifications and knowing where you need to look.I tore the petals off a fake flower and hot glued them to a piece of card stock I cut and taped to the front.  We have had it for months and no one knows it's there.,5,1,2019-8-19,1,1,1
"Works great. My husband and I loved it so much so that we just purchased a second one. It has the option to notify via cell of motion sensor and sound detection. Clear night vision. The camera has a speaker so my husband can talk into his phone, you can hear it come out of the camera. Very good price for what you get. I highly recommend.",5,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"Update: I felt I had to update my review after the January 2020 release of firmware.  The removal of the ability to identify an object as a human versus just a car or moving tree branches severely reduces the value of this camera for outdoor surveillance.  I have this camera inside facing out through a window. I used to be able to get notifications of humans coming to my door, but no more.",3,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

"I purchased one and it set up quickly and easily. The picture quality is decent and the app works well. Liked it so much I purchased a second one.

"Good camera. I bought a second one to look outside at my parking area. Since it's an inside only camera, I build a small cardboard ""cache"" to put it in so that when I open the light in the room, that part of the window can still see outside instead of reflecting the inside of the room. I can't use the infrared vision because that reflects on the window and the cardboard, but it works anyway because I have a street light over my parking and flood lights when anyone walks in the driveway.",5,1,2019-1-5,1,0,1
"Read the one and two star reviews. I won’t bore you with my exasperation, but those low reviews are accurate. Bottom line: If you want to see how your cat spends his busy day, you may be happy with these cameras, at least ‘till they quit. If you are looking for a hardened security system, you’re wasting your time with Wyze. Equally, looking at a sea of lousy reviews but a high four star overall rating calls into question the entire Amazon review system. Amazon Reviews and Wyze cams- both crap.",1,1,2019-4-17,1,0,0
"This is a great, inexpensive way to monitor your house while you’re out! It’s inexpensive but works like a high end unit.

Such a fun, inexpensive little device that is very versatile.",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"Picture quality is fine for the price. The motion detection alarm goes off for changes of light, like cars driving by at night.

Camera did stop functioning outside of my return window.",1,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
Every time i go to look at the app so i can view my cameras the majority of the time i cant. The cameras  have to be power cycled constantly because they keep losing connection.  One of them even says it cant do HD that it has to do 320p.  It says it has a poor connection.  So at least one has a poor wifi antennae.  I have only had these a few days and I've even had to factory reset both of them once because they wouldnt connect even after a power cycle.,1,1,2019-1-14,1,0,0
"Something profoundly appealing to me, when company integration is simple and yet powerful. This little guy would give you perfect images, videos and flexibility. It has many options, and some work better than other.I used it for timelapses. And for that you have to buy any sd card ( 5 dollar ones work just fine).",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"I have 5 or 6 of these cameras and I genuinely could not be happier with them. They have great picture quality, great night vision, and the app is pretty good too. Makes it really easy to outfit the whole home with these guys. You can't get a better camera for the price. Big fan of Wyze and all the other products they make.If you need RTSP, you can pretty easily flash the camera with an alternate firmware (provided by Wyze), though you'll be losing some features if you do. I don't know what those features are because I don't use them but I think it's all stuff that your camera monitoring software can handle on it's own.",5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"Nice small camera, easy to setup. The app is great and does not require a lot of fiddling to use.  I’m a fan and picked one up as a gift for a friend.  The motion and sound alerts work well. My only complaint would be that the switch to night vision mode could be quicker but that’s a minor point considering the amazing price of this camera. Picture clarity is great.",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,1
"Setup was easy, everything worked very well except for the sound from the camera back to the app on my phone (sound from the app to the camera worked fine).  I emailed Wyze tech support in the evening and the very next morning (a Saturday) got an answer from them saying my phone was in a batch that was known to have microphone issues and that they would send me a replacement. By day's end I received confirmation of the replacement order having been created. So they identified the issue and processed a replacement within 24 hours! These guys have their act together. And such a cute, fun little camera.",5,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0

I recently just purchased this item and sat it all up. I can’t say much about long term use.Setting up for the first time is quite easy and fast (at least for me) Instructions came with and helped to set up properly as intended. You download the app and follow instructions inside the app to link it to your WiFi and whatnot. It was a smooth experience. The app works really well. The camera actually has good quality. I was a bit surprised for how cheap it is.,5,1,2019-8-22,1,0,1

This is not the ""get what ya pay for"" i loveee my camera! Only true inconvenience is the plug cord esp being so short...(i have an extension cord a little up the wall to reach..its sitting on top of the curtain rod..in process of remodeling our home & want to paint first) but it just looks kinda ghetto lol. But hey beggars can't be choosers right?! 😝💯👌🏼🙌🏼😍Forgot to mention- I seriously cannot be the only one who waits until that perrrrfect moment & talking through the app & scaring the poop-dookie out of everyone!!Every Momma NEEDS one of these!!NEVER gets old!!😜🤣",5,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
I have two of these one in each of my children’s rooms. The picture quality is perfect! I’ll attach a photo of my daughter sleeping and how well you see her messy room!

This little camera is great! Awesome for the price! Very easy to access on the app when you’re not home.  I do not suggest trying this but I accidentally dropped this in the toilet and put it in the sun to dry out and it works just as fine!! Great product.

"This little camera is amazing. I bought two, one is in the living room and one is inside facing my parking spot and porch outside. I was worried about the camera not working well with the window in the way, but it does an amazing job. Clear view day and night. Also love the fact I get notifications when the cameras detect sound, motion or people. The app is easy enough to use and I am able to check on my living room happenings while at work in real time. I can not recommend this camera enough. Great price and value!!!",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

I have a number of these that are activated when we leave our house.  Easy to setup both the camera and phone app.  Work well.  They are small so video quality is only average and their nigh vision is also only average.  They recently made a change to their motion detection algorithm so it is not as good as it was but they issue regular updates and I bet that gets fixed soon.,5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0

"These cameras are better than my Foscams.  I can (and did) buy four for less than I paid for a previous single cam, and they perform much better.  The ease of set up is amazing (less than 10 minutes).  They also have more capabilities than the more expensive cams.  With totally free cloud storage these cams are even a greater value.  Hopefully the company stays in business because without the company, these cams become blocks of plastic.  With the quality, software (currently being updated frequently) , price and ease of setup, its worth taking a chance on this company.  I plan to buy more in the very near future.",5,1,2019-1-9,1,0,0
My cousin recommended this camera as a baby monitor for my son after I complained about getting up all night to check on him when he’s moving around in his crib. I LOVE THIS! The set up was super easy and took less than 5 minutes. I have it set to notify me of noise and motion between the hours that he is down for bed and I can take a look at him whenever I want. My mom also has access to the camera from her phone so she can look at her grandson whenever she wants to just watch him sleep. For 25 dollars this is an awesome baby monitor.,5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
"I have quite a few cameras most of which claim that they integrate with Alexa and View. This one really does. I can instruct my fire cube to show me this one like I do with the more expensive Amazon Cams and it works (unlike ANNKE).

Set up is a breeze.",4,1,2019-2-15,1,0,0
"Unbelievable, what you get for under $ 30. Good product quality, pretty good software and features that one would find in Homecams costing above $ 150. Good motion sensing and tracking, with ability to define zones. Offers two weeks event storage in the cloud free, yes free!

"This may be HD for the picture, but the video motion can be  little blurry. I really like the SD card capability. I have an 8G in there. I don't care for the fact you MUST use an internet connection via the company's web site. You can't connect to the camera directly. Also, the motion-detect short videos are stored on their website only. The SD stores the full video. Deleting the motion detect from their website is a bit annoying as you can only do 20 at a time even thought the choice says ""all"".I use it as a baby monitor now. I will be connecting via my cell phone's hotspot and using it as backup camera in my truck for when I connect up my trailer. Heard about that and thought it was brilliant.",5,1,2019-3-23,1,0,0

We installed 3 of these to monitor a property. Have been amazed at the picture/video/sound quality. Steady wifi cable is necessary.

Easy to set up and I can see any 3 with a touch of the cell phone screen from anywhere. Cheap subscriptions for under $10 a month for all 3. This company has their act together. I'd give 10 stars if I could.,5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0

I purchased two of these. The quality of the picture is good considering the price. The app makes setup really easy. Unfortunately both of my cameras were defective and do not recognize microSD cards when inserted. Apparently this is a known issue with certain lot numbers based on the Wyze forums. They are supposed to be sending replacements. Fingers crossed.,2,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0
This how much this stuff should cost! Not $199 plus monthly fees. I got this to keep an eye my dog when I’m not home and it does just that.I know there are privacy concerns however I would recommend simply using a quality router and set access settings. I set my settings to monitor traffic and cutoff access during the hours that I’m home. The thought of Chinese intelligence using their resources to watch my dog lick himself brings peace to mind.,5,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"For a $24 wifi camera, this little guy does everything I need it to. The app is super user friendly and I am considering purchasing a few more to have throughout the house. I currently use it as a baby monitor and it's been fantastic. Lets me know when there's motion detected and sound disruptions. I can talk through the camera and listen to what's going on. Awesome features.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
These cameras are a great value.  They do require a strong WiFi signal though.  I have an SD card and store motion events locally to supplement the cloud stored recordings which are only 12 seconds long.  The people recognition works well and minimizes nuisance alerts for motion.  Been using for about a month with almost no issues other than getting a strong WiFi signal to them.,5,1,2019-8-13,1,1,0
"Went on a 2 week trip and wasn't able to have a housesitter during that duration. Bought this and set it up. Super easy to use. This allowed for my sister to keep an eye on my place from her own home through the WYZE app. It makes me feel safe knowing that I can keep an eye out on my place. Detects motion and sound very well. Captured even an outdoor shadow (gardener outside cleaning) through my living room window. Can't beat the price. Picture quality could be better, but it gets the job done.",5,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0
Great customer service!!! The camera I bought did not work properly. I could not get any sound. I communicated via email w the company. They responded very quickly and ended up calling me. They sent me a new camera to replace the defective one. No additional charges to me.  I have been using it for a month to monitor my 18 month old granddaughter when she sleeps. Crystal clear picture. The only thing is the sound detection is delayed by 60 seconds. But motion and sound detectors are amazing sensitive. I am alerted if she moves or makes a sound. Truly an awesome find. I highly recommend.,5,1,2019-5-26,1,0,0
Excellent security cameras with discount price. It can detect motion more than 75 ft away and picture is good. The latest firmware has a lot of improving. I original bought two cameras and later added 4 more cameras since they are so good for a fraction of price comparing to Arlo. I have Arlo cameras both wireless and wire versions. The quality is not much different. There is big different in price.,5,1,2019-4-29,1,0,0
"These cameras are easy to set up and mostly work pretty well.  Unfortunately the ""alert"" feature isn't very usable.  It gets easily distracted on a partly cloudy day, and generates lots of unnecessary alerts when the sun goes behind a cloud.

"We bought two ""Wyze Cam 1080p HD Indoor"" cameras. We have been using them for several months without any major issues. New features are frequently added. Nothing else comes close to providing the same value at that price-point.It is a US company with american programmers, but the hardware is Chinese and is identical to that used for cameras sold by a different companies inside and outside of China. This is important because you can put more trust into the privacy protection.",5,1,2019-1-2,1,0,0

"Buyers beware! If you’re not real tech savvy, you could run into some real problems. After installing the camera, I realized it would only work on WIFI, not on my cell network. After chatting with three different Wyze reps, I learned I was going to have to open some ports on my home router. This was not an easy task and after over 4hrs of research and still chatting with Wyze (who by the way never did tell me HOW to do this) , I could not accomplish this task and decided to return the camera. FYI, during my research, I found numerous other customers who had encountered the same dilemma.",1,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
This is the first security camera I've had and i am thoroughly pleased with it.  I plan to purchase 2 more to complete my security needs. It was very easy to set up I picked this up and had it connected to my wi-fi up & running within a half hour.  It has a wide range of view.  Wyze Cam records events and keeps them on their cloud file for 2 weeks.  For the price with my minimal needs it's perfect!,5,1,2019-9-7,1,0,1
"We have two set up in our house, thinking of adding a third. These are great for keeping an eye on your home. They do not record full time, only 12 second clips if the motion and/or sound detection is activated. You have the option to select certain times to turn sound/motion detection on. Like if you leave for work at 8am and come home at 5:30pm, you can choose those times. I keep mine on motion detection alerts all day and night. I turned notifications off on my phone settings so it doesn’t blow my phone up all day, but saves all the 12 second clips.",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"I bought this camera for someone else because of a security issue they were having. I made sure that the sensitivity settings for both sound and motion were all the way up, and notifications were on and the correct contact information was in the app. It has happened several times where persons walked right by the camera at maybe 15 feet and no notifications were received. I also had the individual share the feed with me so I can monitor as well. Again, no notifications when there was sound or motion near the camera. Without that feature working, this camera is essentially worthless. I'm very disappointed with the purchase.",1,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"I bought this camera and the house for it, so I can use it outside. Forget it, I have it sitting right next to my router and it is dropping the internet connection. when it did work, it was fine (this is 10% of the time).

We use this for our babies nursery and it is wonderful!! Amazing price and best nursery camera. The night vision works great and I love being able to look back through the camera to see how well she slept. I can check on her without having to go in her room and wake her.

"I bought 4 of those cameras 3 months ago and have been very happy with them. They have all the functionalities that I need for indoor use and the quality meets most of my expectations. The price is unbeatable.The only complain I have is the event recording schedule is not flexible enough. Ideally, I would like to be able to have schedule like 12am-8am and 9 am-5:30pm, but it only allows me to schedule from 12am-5:30pm without gap in the middle.",5,1,2019-5-9,1,0,0

"Love the product. As a new consumer to smart technology I could be happier with the price point, and features this Wyze camera has to offer. Compared to others on the market it’s affordable, with much upside and is more than just a starter product, so don’t be wary of price. Quality is great, and features available leave nothing to be desired and the company is on the rise! I’ve also purchased the Wyze Pan Cam, and would recommend that product as #1, but this camera is a close second",5,1,2019-6-10,1,0,0
A coworker recommended this to me after I mentioned I'd be getting a puppy soon.  I love this thing?  I can peep in on my sweet baby anytime during the day or night.

Items such as this give you more trouble that they are worth",1,1,2019-4-15,1,1,0
I can’t think of a single complaint regarding this camera. This was bought as a replacement for a more expensive camera which clearly was lacking all that this budget friendly camera offers.

I will definitely be sticking with Wyze camera family when I expand.,5,1,2019-11-14,1,0,1
"It’s a decent camera.  But the fact that it only records for 12 seconds then goes to sleep for 5 minutes (or whatever), renders it totally useless.  Yes, I could pay a monthly fee for this, but I don’t want to have to do that.  I know this is a cheap camera, but that 12 second limit means that it’s not worth the money.  Just useless.",2,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0

We also use it if we’re doing yard work or playing with the dogs outside. We plan on using it for when he transitions into his own room to keep eyes on him at all times. It’s also detected a few times when we didn’t shut our bedroom door quite good enough and our dog decides she needs the binky more than he does, lol.",5,1,2019-5-19,1,1,1
"Overall great camera for the price.  Only thing missing is being able to access your camera from a computer.  When they develop a desktop app I will buy more of their products.

Can't beat this for the price. Have had the Arlo cameras and this is just as good for a fraction of the price even though it has to be wired. Gave 4 stars because of the QR code nonsense you have to do in the setup process. Be sure to turn the brightness all the way up on your phone. The camera wouldn't read the QR code on my phone until I did.,4,1,2018-12-1,1,1,0

One feature I’d like to see added is an irregular shape function to the motion detection setting. The stock rectangle/square makes it hard to go around a bush.

Everything seemed to run smoothly and I was able to setup an account, connect the camera to the account, and view live feed through the Wyze Iphone app. At home however, I plugged in the camera and opened the Wyze app on my phone only to be told ""no network detected"". My WiFi is running fine, I combed through the manuals on the Wyze support website to verify everything was done correctly and I am using compatible software/firmware/devices but it is still not working. I tried a different camera app but the camera won't read a new QR code, leaving me unable to access the camera at all. I'm sure the camera works fine but the app for this is so terrible, rendering the camera unusable. Think twice before purchasing this, spend a few more dollars and get something with a more reliable, user friendly app.",2,1,2019-5-24,1,0,0
"Hopefully you have your camera right next to your router (or expanded WiFi) or else you’ll never maintain a connection while connects to 2G. Picture quality was great when it actually worked, but 95% of my time with the product has been spent complaining about it not connecting. During the set up process, you better have steady hands and steady patience. I tried reconnecting mine and have spent the past 15 minutes in several different angles trying to get the code to be read. If you want to be frustrated beyond belief and disappointed that if it was actually working, it would be great- this is the camera for you.",2,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"Easy set up.  Great picture both color and night.  The record motion only catches beginning and cuts off after a few seconds.  Unless I missed it, there is no setting to change how long it records.",5,1,2019-8-18,1,1,0
"Overall, based off of features, build, price, etc, I give it a 5 star.  But this is NOT a 5 star camera.  This is NOT Ring quality software.  It has issues, it bugs every now and then, and live feeds tends to digimosh.  But all the issues I have are strictly on the web/app end.  It occassionally disconnects, which can be an issue.  As of now I haven't been able to get the app to recognize that my camera has an SD card.  But, unless you are looking for top quality and willing to spend big money, I'd recomend this for people who even have money to blow on big names.  The issues can be overlooked, and I'm sure will be fixed in the future.",5,1,2019-3-11,1,0,0
"For $20 I do not think that you can find a better quality video camera. I recently had a package stolen off my front porch so I decided that one of these cameras was a good investment. So far I am impressed with the notifications for motion, the quality is all right, and the night vision works great as long as it is not right in front of the glass. I hope my cameras are actually saving things to the cloud though because that is the main reason that I got them.Anyways, if they had a 4k version for double the price i would buy it.",3,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
"Best value for wired power: not batteries,  but wifi data. wow wow. Great HD quality, mobile app, night vision, motion sensor, listen and talk, what what for this low price.

I purchased 3 of these for home security. They work just as good as cameras that cose 3 to 4 times as much. Granted that the picture quality on an expensive camera will be better but the quality here is good enough for the price.You control the camera via an app that alerts you of and motion detection among other things.,4,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
Disappointed. Videos I have seen on this product show it not having to be plugged in. False advertising. It has to stay plugged in to operate. I was looking for something to use that didn't need plugged in constantly as it is used to monitor kids getting up at night and they kept unplugging the Yi camera I had.,3,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
"I got this for my puppy whom we had to leave at home for short times during our commute overlaps.  It's such a great product!  The set up was super easy, the app works great, and the night vision and clarity is fantastic!  The motion detection and alerts work great, too!  We plan to get a few more when we're in a bigger home.",5,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0
Arrived 3 days earlier than expected. I was looking for a camera to view my front yard but I didnt want the hassle of mounting a camera outside. This camera gets the job done. I have mine mounted to the inside of my window and picture quality is just fine. You have to be sure to turn off IR at night. I plan on buying one for the backyard.  Would recommend.,5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,1
"I would not recommend this camera. Picture quality is good and the night vision isn’t bad, but setting up the camera and its motion sensing abilities are awful. It was difficult and not very straightforward to set up the camera to alert me when it sees a person. What’s worse is that most of the time it doesn’t even work. I get notifications all hours of the day for cars driving by, but when I KNOW people have been outside (trash pickup, myself coming and going) it never got a clip of it. It’s a great cheap camera that’s probably better for monitoring an indoor pet or even as a baby monitor. I set it in the window by my front door and it’s terrible for that purpose.tl;dr doesn’t sense people walking by, does sense every single car that drives by.",2,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"Completely unexpected when compared to other similar products. The clarity is absolutely amazing, the individual features such as night vision, motion detection, person recognition, and overall ease of use has made me a lover of this system for my home AND my family. Easy to set up, easy to use, and ultimately the Go-To for a simple and great Home monitoring and home security system!!!!!",5,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
"Very very very disappointed with this camera. I was looking for something simple and easy to put for my dogs when I’m at work, but this product is the most painful device ever. First of all every single time I unplug the device I have to set it up again. It is so inconvenient because the whole set up process is also an absolute hit or miss case. I’m very disappointed in this product and even though the picture quality and everything is good, I do not recommend this product.",1,1,2019-12-29,1,1,0
"I love this cam, I bought it to monitor my pup, and I kid you not this is better than the ring system I have at home.

"Love these cameras, easy to set up and works well for been so cheap. I have 5 and only one came with a defective power cord that I had to tape to the camera for it to work.

Guess we’ll have to take our chances...",4,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0
"I decided to buy this camera instead of a baby monitor, this being the cheaper option. I like it better than most baby monitors because I can access live feed or footage from any of my devices instead of an assigned screen. I have had it for well over a year with little to no issues.

"If you have chrome cast you can mirror your phone onto your TV and see a lovely HD clear display of your wyze camera.

Im still on my first week of having this cam and will update if i feel like its needed in the future.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"Unit worked right out of the box and several months later it is working just fine. The accompanying app on iOS has been just what I needed to notify me on demand.

"I love this little thing!!! It's a lot smaller in person than it is even in the videos I've watched about it on Youtube. I didn't think that was possible. Set up is extremely easy. You can manage everything from one application and they are constantly updating the app and adding features. I will say that it does take disconnect some times but I think that may be due to my internet connection. This thing has so many features for such a cheap price. For those that are looking at the price and thinking it's too good to be true, trust me I've been there and this device does not disappoint.",4,1,2018-1-3,1,1,0
"Can’t believe the price is so low. I would have guessed something like this would be at least 100 dollars. Motion detection, Infrared recording, sound recording, remote viewing, motion triggering with adjustable sensitivity, cloud storage or MicroSD (or both), adjustable definition so you can record days with just 32 gigs... Just know that you can’t use night mode through double pane glass, but that’s true with any IR camera.",5,1,2018-11-6,1,0,0

Pros:  Awesome little video camera. We use it to keep an eye on our pets food while we are on trips. Use SD card to increase storage.  Home Depot now sells them.Cons:  Once the subscription runs out you lose the motion detector notification but that’s no big deal unless it is used for home security.,5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"2 stars because I could get the live stream to work perfectly and it has great video quality. However, I couldn't get the motion detection to record nor the playback feature to work at all. Tried all the hoopla with the sandisk sd card(s), factory reset, uninstall application, ect. I love tech and can usually troubleshoot my way out of problems. Not this. Tried it all. Eventually, In the end I couldn't even get the cam to connect with the app at all. Oh well.",2,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"Love this camera! I bought two, and I'm very happy!! I would give it a 5 star rating if the cloud video clip length were a little longer, or could be extended. (It's limited to a relatively short clip length for the free cloud storage - which is fine considering it's free cloud storage!! - but I ordered their 32GB SD flash card so that will make up for this limitation.)I don't blame them for not including onboard storage in order to keep the cost down however.",4,1,2018-12-25,1,0,0

"I've used other wifi cameras before WYZE started selling their models and always thought they were overpriced and have limited features. Since I purchased my 1st WYZE Cam a few years ago I've purchased 5 more and I couldn't be more pleased!!! Fantastic prices and features you don't find on any other cameras that can cost 5 times as much!!! When you find a company that ""GETS IT"" you stay with them!!!!

"They are cheap and fun, the software and hardware need further developing. I have a good solid 90 seconds of a man stealing my mower, from 2 different cameras. The quality is not high enough to zoom in and distinguish his face. The software really needs to have an option to only record when it seems a face or human. I have hours and hours of cars driving by, shadows coming and going with the sun/clouds, and lots and lots of bugs.",3,1,2019-4-12,1,0,1
Wow this project was worth every penny. Great product for 25$!! I have a camera that is 40$ Wansview camera and this one is better quality.Set up took like 5 minutes SUPER Easy . (My husband usually connects these kinds of things but I did it no problem).,5,1,2020-3-26,1,0,0
would give 0 stars but I can't.  12/29 there is verification of a leak of unprotected user data by wyze.  Having server security this lax does not bode well for a home security camera company.,1,1,2019-12-30,1,1,0
"These are neat little cameras but are not ready to be used as a home security system. Basic monitoring is great, but the motion sensors will only fire on e every 5 minutes and constantly miss thinga. On top of that playback via the app is buggy and often crashes, creating a timelapse only works for future recordings which I see zero point in, and you cannot capture clips after the fact even if using local sd storage. With some updates to the software these could be fantastic, but as they are now 3 stars at best.",3,1,2018-2-14,1,0,0
"This is a great little stationary camera. I've mounted mine in a carport, well out of weather's potential harm along with one of their pan tilt cameras. Picture quality is great. I only wish Wyze had a PC monitoring app and it wasn't solely tied to my phone. There are a couple of Android emulators which will run on a PC which allow for running of phone apps, but slow and unstable in my estimation. I ordered this and the  Wyze Cam as a pair along with a RING Video Doorbell. I can tell you the Wyze solution is far superior in picture quality and ease of use/monitoring. Oh, and the cloud based feature is free unlike the Ring ecosystem. Try these first and then decide of the Ring costs are worth it.",5,1,2019-7-27,1,0,0
"Price doesnt justify the quality. these things are excellent.  Good 2 way sound quality.  3 separate video quality settings, 360P, SD and HD.  I have the lowest quality setting selected for saving bandwidth and they are crystal clear.  2 of these were paired with a Amazon Echo Spot.  the Wyze app works great, minimal buffering.  Must use Wyze app to use 2 way,  currently doesnt support 2 way on Echo Spot.  @ $25 a pop, ill be buying more.",5,1,2018-12-9,1,0,0
"This camera is amazing as a baby monitor. The only problem is that the app/sound does not stay on when you change to another screen on your phone, so I'd suggest using an old phone/tablet to keep the app open.Just make sure the phone/tablet isn't too old or the app won't be compatible. We learned this the hard way.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
These are great cameras for the money! My daughter son in law told me about them (they have 1) and I thought I would try them out so I bought 3 of them and bought 2 of the little birdhouse covers so I could use 2 of them outside.so far they are working great and I'm getting ready to buy 2 more.,5,1,2019-1-10,1,0,0
"At this price this is definitely a worth purchase. Yes, you have a fair point if you are worried about data security and your video being broadcast over the internet. My solution, don't set it up in common areas - I have it focused it at the baby crib, empty garage or the backyard.Works great as a baby monitor - live feeds are sent to your phone. Also connects to Alexa and you can direct the feed to a TV using voice commands. Very cool and very useful. I have a $180 Nest Cam and it can't do this.",5,1,2019-2-28,1,0,0
I  bought 4 and 1 pan camera. Good video quality. You have options for SD or HD quality. Two way talk is a plus and with some and carbon monoxide detection /alert also notifying you on your phone. You can zoom in and out on tour phone and control your pan. My only concern is the security of the cloud storage. You can use microSD for loop recording.  Great product.,5,1,2019-2-2,1,1,0
This camera really is as easy to install as the other reviews say! I thought something would go wrong (because it always does) but it was so simple and fast!We are amazed at how well it works too. After you download the app you name the camera and that's it. You can view a live feed from the app anytime you have wifi & you can even zoom in.

"Headline says it all pretty much.  The App is buggy as all get out, constantly freezes and needs restarted.  The actual hardware works pretty well for how much it costs, but eventually will degrade if they see any sort of sun as the IR filters will start to break down; this is a known and well documented issue.",2,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"I love this camera! Helps me keep track of my cats while also providing security.  I cannot wait until outdoor versions arrive.The initial setup was easy. When the setup asks to scan the qr code, make sure to use the camera to scAn the code.  I was using my phone at first, lol",5,1,2019-1-1,1,1,0
This product shows that a great camera can be a fair price & be good quality. The footage is great and it has SOUND detection too which is great. You can use it as an additional baby camera and it records footage. You can save it for a whole month I think as long as you have an SD card. And that is free. The camera itself it's small and light and portable of needed. Really easy to use.,5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,1
It works pretty well for the price but motion detection is already messing up on day 3 of use. It's acting crazy with the little green box bouncing around even though there is nothing moving. Other than that it works. Night vision isn't horrible either for the price. I love the app though.Update I'm still impressed with the camera and it seems to be working well. And the motion detection is working again. For the price it's worth it.,4,1,2019-3-24,1,0,0
Had read about these cameras in some of the blogs i follow.  Bought these after my mother passed and had to go back and forth between two houses.  These work great and alert me to motion and or sound if I set it up for that.  For the price these work great and do what I need them to do.  When I am at one location I have the cameras setup on the doors of the  house that I want to keep secure.,5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"We set this up to use in our daughters room as a baby monitor now we have WiFi. It’s very easy to operate on the app, and the picture quality is awesome. I love that we can be at peace at night mowing we get an alert if she moved or makes a sound, we can open the app and check in from anywhere. I like to check on our dogs while we’re out in town and it’s great for that. It can be moved anywhere in the house just by plugging into the wall. I high recommend for anyone looking for an affordable option for a baby monitor without having to spend hundreds of dollars.",5,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0
"Set up was a bit annoying initially,  but after a few tries, it worked. It failed to update to the latest firmware.

"This was the first camera I have bought in several years. I strictly wanted to use it for watching over my room when I was out of town. The camera does everything it says it so does for the price. If you want a camera that works, but doesn’t have all of the additional add ons that bring up the price... than this is a good buy. If I could improve one thing, it would be the magnet that comes with the camera. I attempted to place my camera on the side of a wall but the magnet wasn’t super strong so it kept slipping out of alignment. Aside from that, definitely worth the budget price.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

It may not be the fanciest security camera, but easily worth the price! Would definitely recommend",5,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0
"In general this camera works okay, but it often just stops working randomly. Sometimes it clicks and switches from color to night vision.

I have 3 different high end cameras so my bar going into this was already high. This camera is good if you’re on a budget. 1080 quality is fairly grainy. The unit is Made of very cheap plastic. The mounting piece for the wall is an over sized washer that does a poor job at clinging onto the magnet that is attached to the camera box.,3,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
Waste of money. I turn down sensitivity on the camera and microphone all the way to zero and it still sends an alert every time there’s a flicker of light or the wind blows.This is not a smart appliance. Doesn’t know the difference between a car headlight traveling across the room and an intruder.,1,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
It was alot smaller than I was expecting so I took a photo to show how small it really is.  It works great though and can put up anywhere.  You can put a micro SD card right into it.  It also has the option for a subscription to push a button and share the video with a security team who will contact the authorities and do everything for you.  This gives a lot of peace of mind who you're a single mother living alone with children.,5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,1
"I loved it, worked great until it didn't. Worked with tech support on how to get it going again and nothing worked. Haven't heard back since my last email three days ago. I am guessing there is no warranty. I figure it is dead. Mine was in the garage in MN - maybe that was a factor. My sister has one up in her chicken coop in MD since the fall and it still works. I put one in my parents garage last fall - they live an hour south of me in Iowa and it still works. So for $25 there is a 66% chance of it working even in subzero temperatures.",3,1,2019-2-8,1,1,0

"If you want a small camera to observe an area without being detected - such as trying to detect someone sneaking around your property or house - this is not the camera for you.  It is pretty small.  But it has four obnoxious lights for the night vision and clicks loudly.  Not covert at all.  More like, ""hey, look at me.  Pretend I am not recording you..."".  Duh!",3,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
"I bought 3 of these camera after reading all the reviews and they are all I needed. Perfect size, movable mount, a convenient magnetic base with a metal piece to attach it easily on any wall. You only need an app and you have the cameras working in minutes. Now I have control of the 3 rooms were I have the cameras and can talk with my kids, record events and I even activated a smoke and CO alarm (I wasn't looking fot that but it's a nice option). Everything for $25. Definitely will be buying more of these in the future.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"Love this little cam, I’ve got several now including the Pan. Works great and is very inexpensive. Not to mention the company is constantly adding new features and welcoming suggestions from the community. The only downside is motion is very sensitive as well as the nightvision. I often don’t get a clear image at night. But other than that fantastic device.",5,1,2019-6-4,1,0,0
"Great value for the price. Very easy to setup and run. More than acceptable image quality, with good night vision and motion detection capaabilities. I am using this to monitor my 3D printers while I am out of the room. There is nothing ""private"" or personal taking place in my maker space, so I decidedly ignore the very real issue of PRC/PLA intercepts of the video stream. Again, for my specific intended purpose, this is a great piece of tech at a very good price.",4,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"I bought two of these. I normally dont write reviews either. However, after buying two and installing them, I bought a few more. These cameras are great. Installation was a slight problem. However my issue was that it was connecting to my network/wifi. After I turned the wifi off on my phone, it connected right away. Not sure why that caused the problem. Easy to use. Highly recommended, especially because the cameras are also cheap.",5,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"LOVE these cameras! I own both Foscam and Tenvis cameras also, and Wyze beats them hands down for the price and picture quality!! I find the picture quality on Wyze Pan camera is slightly superior over the Wyze Cube, but both are equally an amazing value. The added FREE seven day cloud storage just gives these little gems that much edge over the competition. The are easy to set up and the app works perfect! I'm so expressed with this company that I now own 4 of their cameras and their new Wyze sense, and getting ready to purchase more!",5,1,2019-5-19,1,0,0
The camera and idea are great. However once you start setting it up the QR code is a pain. It doesn’t scan. I tried over and over numerous times. It just didn’t work. I wish I tried to set these up sooner because I’d return them. So disappointed. I do like the size style and idea of them but nothing I did to get these to set up would work.,2,1,2020-7-9,1,1,0
"I've had other ""budget"" security cameras and this one has been the best of them all. Just the fact that I never have to pay for a monthly subscription and all of my videos are stored on an SD card makes this camera much better than the competition. I put this in the window (since it cannot go outside) and it can capture faces even across the road. I would 100% recommend this camera for anyone looking for an affordable security system.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"Awesome little cam! Subscription is pretty cheap so you can get continued motion detection, highly recommend that. They are still working on person detection, and it does need alot of work still.

"I’m using this a baby monitor and it’s awesome. It’s nice to have the motion detector for when my baby gets older and rolls over so I can be notified Incase she needs to be flipped back to her back. Some baby monitors are hundreds of dollars so this really gave me peace of mind!  It does lag like 1 second but not a big deal or surprise. Easy to set up, definitely getting more for other parts of my house.",5,1,2019-8-10,1,0,1
"I bought two of these cameras, one for home and one for my office. After using them for several months, I will soon be buying several more. I especially like the continuous sound and motion detection. And there are absolutely no fees. Alert events are also available for review for up to 15 days. The only thing is, they are extremely sensitive to motion, and I haven’t taken the time to adjust the sensitivity. I even get alerts when insects fly by the cameras, or heavy clouds move across the sky on my camera looking out. Wow!",5,1,2019-6-16,1,0,0
"Provides one glue pad for the mounting magnet, assuming that you'll mount this once and not move it. Using this for a puppy litter, so I need to move it as the litter grows and it's been a challenge getting the camera to stay without using the glue pad. The weight of the wire can move the camera, so tape that to something with painter's tape. Other than that, the camera is perfect and super-easy to use.Note to manufacturer: it would be nice to be able to turn the microphone off at the source.",4,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"Received notifications on my iphone of events. Was unable to view the event most of the time.  Every time I opened the ap to connect to the camera, settings had changed.  No motion detection.  Worked with Wyze tech support for two days, problems were never solved.",1,1,2020-8-27,1,2,0
I use this as a baby monitor. I have the voice monitor next to it at night since the sound is delayed and skips out sometimes on the camera. But it has great night vision. As for security use the quality can get very pixelated or fuzzy with detail. Especially with zooming in so you may not be able to identify a trespasser.,3,1,2019-1-24,1,1,0
I love this camera for 1. Price is outrageously cheap for a great product! 2. Motion detection is on point! 3. Picture quality is great as well!Only thing I have a problem with which to me is not a big deal but night vision does kinda suck if you have it looking out a window at night you have to keep a front porch light on or a light period because when you turn on the night vision(light) it reflects off the window and you can’t see what it is videoing.,5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"For the price, this is an incredible home camera. Is it as good as the $150 cameras? No. But you shouldn’t expect it to be. At this price point, this camera does so much more than I expected it to. The picture quality is pretty good. The sound quality is decent. I love the free cloud storage feature and the fact that I can access it anytime from my phone.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
Very easy camera to use. Pretty good picture for the price. Can be used  in a window to watch a door at night if you completely tape over the uv lights on the front of the camera. But you have to leave  an outside light on . PS if you have a VPN on your phone you have to turn it off to view remotely,5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
"Each camera is about $25 bucks. Same for the memory card. Set up for 1 of 3 cams were a snap. Cam 2, not so easy, but it eventually worked. Looked all over the site for customer support and its only by email with a 3-5 day response time. I then went on YouTube and found a customer support number. Got it fixed. However, Cam 3... they'll need to replace it. Entire process to include ""support treasure hunt"" took about 2.5 hours. If they would have set up like the Cam 1, all 3 would have taken about 15 min's. DISAPPOINTING.",1,1,2019-3-8,1,1,0
"Enabling RTSP requires a special firmware downloaded from Wyze. It works fine for a little bit but then the RTSP feed just completely dies seemingly at random.

"This is an update for a Wyze products purchased through Amazon. Originally five cameras including one pan camera, for lightbulbs, and three plugs. I’ll have failed.

"I bought 7 of these, plus the 32 gig sd cards and outdoor mountable covers for each one. I got all of them up and running and then went on vacation for three weeks. Within about three days all cameras are not working and there is a ""power cycle code"" reading on all of them. There is no way to remotely power cycle them unless you are physically there to do it. They did me absolutely no good while on vacation. I wrote to WYZE last week and they have yet to respond. I have been reading all kinds of posts/reviews about this same issue. It is a real problem. I will be returning these when I get home from my vacation. So dissappointed in these cameras.",1,1,2019-2-27,1,0,0
"The camera is ok (audio... not too good).The app, and associated software, is horrible. notifications continue to get turned on & off without any intervention (NO ONE ELSE HAS ACCESS).

"Wyze executed an update without giving an option to temporarily defer. Caused all cameras to go offline. Contacted support, was told someone needed to be there to restart all 5 cameras. I was on a 2 month RV vacation and 3000 miles away. So much for security ! Told nothing they could do, useless! Also I would like the event notifications to have an individual sound and not my email alert which I usually ignore. Don’t waste your money!!",1,1,2020-9-20,1,1,0
I have 2 installed inside where I would be wasting my wireless Arlo cameras. Inexpensive and easy to setup. If you are worried about chinese spies unplug it.

So affordable and dirt cheap! Thanks so much amazon!(:",5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
"I love these little cameras! I say ""these"" because I initially bought one, but loved it so much I followed up with two more! They're so inexpensive I'm going to load up on more of them. Just do yourself a big favor though.  If you're wishing to record on an SD card, do not use Windows to format it. Use the official program downloaded from SDcard dot org. This will save you a lot of headaches I can assure you.  I like the app for these too. Everything you need, right where you want it.",5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
"The price is great. I purchased 2 cameras and 2 32gb cards.  I have a problem where the IR does not work at night.  Now, let me be very clear, I am not pointing the cameras through glass, I am not pointing the cameras outside where there are car headlights passing by.  These cameras are pointing inside .  Now I did notice in researching these problems that there were indications from the company back in early 2018 that they were working on a priority fix, well it is now early 2019. I have a question , is the fix a firmware fix or a hardware fix???  If it's a hardware fix then these cameras should not have been sold.  These cameras cannot detect anything when the room(s) are totally dark or a very tiny speck of light in the background. There appears to be a lot of frustrated people with these issues.  Yes , these cameras are sold at a very low price but the company keeps indicating fixes are coming and they are NOT!!!",2,1,2019-2-19,1,0,0
My go-to camera for security - monitoring dogs while at work. This camera has all the functions of the expensive ones I’ve bought in the past. It works- it’s HD - and the app is simple to use. For those of you with dogs who potentially like to get into certain things while you’re away - Being able to speak through the camera via your phone when you get a notification of “A lot of Motion” has made life more amusing and easy to keep things from being torn up. I have a larger than normal front living room and just one of these can capture the entire room. Worth it - and will save you a lot of money!,5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
"This is a great little camera! It's reasonably priced, comes with a good app, and doesn't cost you per month to use! You can also insert a microSD card for constant recording. It says you can only use a 32GB card, but I'm using a 128GB card without issue. Video is 1080p and decent quality, and night vision is effective.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0

"Works really good, good quality, good motion detection and sends alert within seconds.  Only issue i see is, interval between two notification is too large 5-10 mins.  In this case, one needs to fetch the recorded video from local storage for the notification time to see the entire happening.  I wish there was a configuration where we can set the alert video length to 1 min (instead of default 12 seconds).",4,1,2018-12-12,1,0,0
I just went by the reviews. It's a good camera with good picture and motion detection. The only thing I didn't realize was it needed an SD card to record all the time. Easy fix. For the money it's a great buy. I added to my existing cameras. Now I have 5. I will probably buy another one for the other side of the house.,4,1,2019-6-2,1,1,0
We use this camera so my daughter can check in  on me and her daughter while she is at work.  It’s a safety thing.  It was easy to set up and as far as I am concerned the picture is great.

"I've bought 4 or 5 of these cameras and already two have quit. One after 3 uses, and the other after 2 uses. I plug them in before long trips so that I can keep an eye on my cats.

"The camera itself is great - good picture quality, very easy setup.However, its motion detection is not very smart. Even on the low setting, I will get an alert if a cloud passes over and the lighting in the house changes. This makes it not very useful for actually detecting something happening in real time, as there are too many false positives to leave alert notifications on.",4,1,2018-4-12,1,1,0
"Great little camera. I use it as a beardie cam. I didn't have any expectations for the price point but I am really impressed with the little camera.

Was not sure how to access cloud library as it wasn’t found anywhere until after updating camera firmware, then events started recording and cloud access was self evident. Also, night vision doesn’t work well through low e windows, must install in external housing for this to work well due to IR lights on camera.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0

"I have purchased a lot of camera's made in china for 35 dollars, and the apps for them are terrible. Dozens of apps and noneof them reliably connect. This camera always connects. And it integrates with alexa very easily. I'v only tried the motion sensing a few times, and it seems a little quirky. I will give it a good test when i'm gone for a week. I would deffinately recommend this for an indoor camera. I'm buying two more..",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"The product worked great for the first year with regular and reliable motion detections, recording and notifications. However, after about a year, no more motion detection, even after setting it at 100% sensitivity, and thus no recording notification. It’s pretty useless after about a year. It works more like a dummy camera now.",1,1,2020-7-5,1,1,0
Works well every time. Great picture quality. Night vision(IR) isn't good in darkness but if there is enough ambient light(street lights or outdoor light fixture)the picture quality at night is good.

"Love these cameras, I have 4 now. One to monitor my 3d printer, front yard backyard, and garage. I like the new feature of person detection, cuts down on getting notifications from shadows, wind ect.

The cameras didn’t work for me and require a a specific WiFi capability so not good for portability in my opinion. Also there made out of plastic or some material very similar and when you extend the camera it just feels like it has weak support.

"Exceptional picture quality.  Using as a baby camera.  Sound is a bit out of tone, but acceptable.  A lot of plastic, but for this price it's a real value.

These cameras are unbelievable and have a great picture quality. Zoom is a decent feature too. App is lacking somewhat as far as setting to the event recording time which is only a few seconds.

Another review for that.,5,1,2019-5-31,1,0,0
For a cheap no subscription security camera it has great picture/video quality. It's easy to set up and the app is easy to maneuver. The push notifications keep you posted about any noise or motion detections as they happen. The only complaint I have is the new set up for the scheduled times for the camera to be on. There's no option for the days anymore so it'll send motion detection notifications on the weekend when I'm home moving around.,5,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0

We received this camera yesterday to keep an eye on our pets while we are gone and so far so good. The set up is really easy and camera range for being such a small camera is pretty broad. The only thing that everyone should make sure they know is that this has to be plugged in order to work. The cord is a decent length but not long enough to get up to really hight corners and the cord itself can be a bit of an eyesore. The sound is a little wonky and sounds a little ocean like but you can still hear everything just fine. Other than that we have zero complaints so far.

I never thought a $20 camera would be so amazing!! I am 100% satisfied!!

The only thing I don’t like it that there isn’t any advanced security options to ensure the camera doesn’t get hacked.I have a Petcube Play camera for my cats that costs $150 - this Wyze camera does all of the same things, except it doesn’t have an interactive laser pointer.

It also comes with a magnet plate so you can mount it to a wall (base of camera is magnetized). 4/5 stars because the image can be grainy at times.

The camera takes pictures and records video in HD which is great because they are very clear.My only reason for not giving this 5 stars is because of the security issue. When a car arrives their license is obscured and peoples faces are not clear.

Fortunately I didn't experience any break-ins, but I was able to see how Wyze Cam would record my coming and going as it detected the motion as I left and returned. And would send me an audible notification. I'm very happy with it.",5,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0
"So I purchased this camera to protect the hallway of my apartment building from package thieves! Well unfortunately, the motion AND person detection sucks. It missed two package thieves, it misses the drivers dropping off the packages, the packages just appear on the sound events when a car that is too loud drives by. If you want sound detection, this camera is for you. Motion/Person detection? I'd give it one star, but I feel like that is left for truly bad products.",2,1,2019-8-16,1,1,0
"Generally easy setup and for viewing real time works alright. Great price obviously. However, corners were cut because viewing the playback (arguably the most important part of security cameras) it fails 100% of the time. When you scroll back to the playback it may play 30 seconds or so, then will proceed to re-authenticate the device you never stopped using and updates to a live stream view. Don’t even consider trying to save videos Because once it authenticates the video fails to save. If you have the money, spend it on an arlo, it will be much better. If price remains a big concern then stick with this but, be aware of these potential problems.",2,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"I bought two of these for my house, then I liked them so much I bought 2 more. I have one to watch my youngest at nap. Another 2 for their playroom and another on a window to see them outside. Super easy to install, less than 5 minutes. It’s nice talking thru the cameras to my kids too. I can do outside work on my yard and see if my daughter is still asleep for nap. My husband is gone working out of town a lot, but has same app to see all the cameras too. Highly recommend these.",5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"This thing would be great, if it could ever connect. When I’m on the same WiFi, the live streaming works great. When I’m on different WiFi or cellular data, 9 times out of 10 it can’t connect, and when it does, it freezes, errors, and tells me that the connection is weak. The only reason that it’s not 1 Star is that it does work well detecting and recording motion, and sending the alert, it does link with IFTTT, and that it’s $20.",2,1,2019-1-19,1,0,0
"This is the best option in the market as of now. Excellent camera quality, good cloud storage and very small. Was able to even capture an amazon package theft using this camera and report it.

"The ads say it will work with Alexa on a Kindle.  Well it doesn't.  I call Wyze tech support and she said:  ""The Wyze app works on Android and Apple smartphones and tablets. The Wyze app requires Android 5.0+ and iOS 9.0+. The Wyze app is not compatible with Windows phones/tablets or Kindle Fire tablets.""  So why is it advertised that is will?  I'm not a tech person.  I don't even own a cell phone.  I'm out the $26.  Not happy.",1,1,2019-5-21,1,1,0
"Add a sd card and it will record everything, for a week or so. After the card is full it just starts to overlap. So if something happens, and you catch it within the week,  it's on the sd card.

"I've tried several home security cameras. For price and quality, these are pretty solid. Pulling up a recorded video takes a minute to load but just be patient. I see a lot of people talking about the fact that they might record when they're off and they're worried about their privacy etc. As far as I know just about everything these days can be hacked so you should probably worry about anything that's connected to the internet.  Also, if you got something to hide, don't put a damn camera on it. If somebody wants to watch the average boring life all day, so be it.",5,1,2019-3-2,1,0,0
"I am now a proud owner of 3 wyze came!! They are super high tech for being so cheap. And they are alexa compatible which is a MUST. I am, however, a little saddened as the HD is certainly not HD and the cameras tend to stop working after some time, requiring me to restart them. Still love them though, and they make great baby cans!",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"For $25 I am extremely pleased. The audio is a little fuzzy and the picture is a little gritty, but overall, I can see what I want to see and I can hear what I want to hear. Notifications work great and you can zone in on certain spaces that are more important to you (ex front door). Overall, great buy!",5,1,2018-8-6,1,1,0
Love these little cameras.  I now own three of these and will probably get a couple more.  Easy to install.  Uses your home WIFI so there are no contracts or services needed from a vendor.

"This camera is terrible! Every time I try to log on remotely, there is an issue. If I do receive a video feed, it don’t last long. I used this camera as a scare tactic more than anything until I purchased a new camera that actually worked. Bad call as I passed the return date and now stuck with this piece of junk. I ran a speed test at the location of the camera and was receiving almost 500mbps. Don’t waste your money",1,1,2019-4-13,1,0,0
"So I have about 2 weeks of usage and just cant complain for the price I am able to view live feed and get notifications when I'm miles away the quality is surprisingly great no complaints even in night mode looks good I spray painted mine wize cam black and much more discreet. Outdoor use magnets are very handy, the only complaint is it seems to lose connection and sometimes doesn't notafy me when motion is detected,motion detection is 7/10 I could live with it but not super reliable besides that I would rather buy one more cam then a overpriced ring cam",4,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0
"It is perfect, if the software works.Set up recording when there is motion and it will record 12 seconds. Sounds cool, then if you want to see the playback at that time, IT IS JUST BROKEN. It will not load and just stuck there, scroll left or right and it will load several kbs and then stay at 0.0k. Fix this and it will be a 5 start. This makes this product unusable because you can not see anything other than the 12 seconds.",4,1,2019-2-21,1,0,0
"Our only complaint - and it may be that we're doing something wrong - is that the person notification does not work.  It did for the first few days, but no longer.  In order to see who approached our front, we have to go the the event selection and look for a person.  Still, for the small price, it's a good deal.  Very easy to install.",4,1,2019-8-28,1,0,0

She has some separation anxiety, so its nice  that i can talk to her and i even caught her in the act of ripping up a puppy pad lol never happened again after i told her not  to (she is an easy pup u only gotta tell her once).

"Doubted this product due to the low price and I couldn’t be happier with what I got. The only bad thing is that I didn’t buy more at once. The installation takes less than 5 minutes, the app is user-friendly and couldn’t be easier to use. I would HIGHLY recommend this camera for everyone and for several uses! Whether you’re trying to monitor your kids at home, security purposes or simply trying to stay alert, get this Wyze cam!",5,1,2019-2-6,1,0,1

"I love this little camera, we purchased it for our enclosed porch when the neighbors to the right and left of us had break ins within a week (in our normally very quiet neighborhood) it’s super small but has great quality and easily hooks right up to your phone through an ap. I just placed the camera among little trinkets on our shelf to try and be more discreet. The only reason I’m giving it a 4 and not a 5 is because the cord itcomes with is very short and until purchasing a longer one limits where you can place the camera.",4,1,2019-6-17,1,0,1
"For the price this is definitely 5 stars. The video is clear and the app is easy to use. Set up was super simple too. I only have 2 comments. 1. I wish there was an “off” button. I use it for security, but don’t want it recording me when I’m home so unplugging it is a minor annoyance. 2. The motion detection is very sensitive even on the lowest settings. My notifications are blowing up for things like sunlight coming through the window. But! It is a great little camera and I would recommend it to anyone.",5,1,2018-3-16,1,0,0
Cameras and hardware are very very good for the amount of money they ask for them. Took 2 minutes tops to set up. Perfect for what I need. I actually bought some of their outlet products to test for a very good deal. I'll keep you posted. Thanks but would definitely recommend for purchase of your looking for something not too expensive but you know it's reliable.,5,1,2019-9-29,1,0,0

It would be good I suppose except the app freezes continuously and it seems impossible to find the play back time.  It also would be helpful to have a slow motion feature or fast forward feature but no you get to guess where anything may or may not be.

Have owned really high end security cams for many years. The 1080P on these is amazing. Motion alert zones and their adjustment are spot on. Push messages immediate. Feature rich. Holds wifi connection. Power cord a bit short for every application - longer cords available. Remember NOT to use nite vision if looking out a windowpane. Ambient light outside will have to do. Bang for the buck.,5,1,2018-12-28,1,0,0
"I use Samsung smart cameras for a continued security monitoring. Most of them are behind the windows looking out with IR off. I gave wyzecam a try in the same application. The results not even close, it failed miserably due to low light sensitivity. I guess they a cheap for a reason.",2,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0
"These cameras can't be beat for the price. With the SD card, I get a few days' worth of video and the notifications are great. The sound - both parts of the 2 way - is okay, but it does the job. The night viewing mode is great, but it doesn't work well if you have it in a window because of the glare. All in all, I've had no issues with these cameras and will buy more in the future! They'll be even better once they have Google Home support!",5,1,2019-2-23,1,0,0
"Ok, lets see, Material quality = plastic but I like how flexible and multi-angled, Picture Quality = 5 star for relatively close, not that clear at a distance, I don't know why but there is a lot of pixelization until the subject stops moving, never had this with any of my other brands of cams. They  seem to get quite warm, I don't know if I would put them in any kind of closure or any thing on top of them. For the price, they are a good buy the software woks very well, and support 32 GB Micro SD",5,1,2018-8-17,1,0,0
"This camera is TRASH. I understand it is a very inexpensive option for a wifi camera so I didn't have very high expectations. But I did hope that it would at minimum function as described. When you can get it to connect and stream, it actually looks very decent. The picture is pretty clear. The night vision is decent but not great. When operating it will detect every single car that passes by, the wind blowing the trees, birds flying, and even the rain. But it does NOT detect people walking by, people coming thru the gate, or the dog that has been pooping in my yard. The most irritating and problematic issue is that it just doesn't connect 9 out of 10 times and the one time that it does it doesnt last long, maybe 5 minutes. The majority of the time it says to power cycle it. Sometimes after doing that it will work for a short while again and then disconnect once again. Other times you will have to power cycle it multiple times to get it to connect. Waste of money and time messing with it. Try any other option, an app on an old phone works better.",1,1,2019-4-9,1,0,1
"Great can for the price. I was able to capture the image of an intruder who was breaking into the apartment washer/dryer coin boxes.That said, transitioning from live view to stored images and back is flaky. Doesn't always work.",4,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
So Far I love this thing.  Took about 5 minutes to set it up and place it where I wanted it.  I am testing this thing and plan to buy a few more if I like how it works.  Within 5 minutes of setting it up I caught my dog sneaking onto the new couch. She is much more sneaky than I thought.  Very happy that I researched before buying one of those cameras that are $100 or more.  I can get several of these for the price of one of those.  I haven't got my alerts working perfectly yet but I really think I am going to like this camera.,5,1,2018-1-18,1,1,0
Motion for my application did not work as it seems to be all over the place. I placed one in my garage to make sure my door is actually closed when I’m away. And one in a window overlooking my driveway and one in my front room window to see the front door. Picture is great far better than I thought a 23 dollar camera would be and the night vision is good. I can see everything in my garage like it’s daylight. Not a fan that it has a microphone in it but if you get creative you can make sure it’s disabled other than just using the settings in the app. For the money it’s great,5,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"This little device is amazing! I was skeptical when I saw the price, but I could not be more pleased. It is very small and can be placed darn near anywhere. The sound is decent, but this could just be because my home internet is so slow. The video quality is crystal clear and the viewing angle is very wide which easily allows a whole room to be seen. The only thing I don’t like is that 1) it has to be connected to a power cord, and 2) the supplied power cord seems short to me. That’s a minor gripe, though. I would highly recommend this camera, especially for the price!",5,1,2018-10-24,1,1,1
WOW! I assumed this would be a piece of crap but it’s JUST AS GOOD as the $300 Nest Cam I got for my first baby. I cannot believe it was $25. Very happy with this purchase! I’m also going to recommend it to expecting moms I know so they don’t waste money on the expensive ones!,5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"It does not detect people, it only picks up cars. I have it set to detect and record motion made by people. I also specified the area I want it to detect motion and it fails to do that as well and records outside of it. Quality is good but I am not too happy with how the camera works. Even when it detects a car, it records the very end of the motion.",3,1,2020-7-8,1,1,0

This is a great product! We currently use it as a baby monitor and as an extra security camera when we leave town. We will definitely be buying more.

Done that a few times!,5,1,2019-5-12,1,0,0
"Absolutely amazing quality for the price. Everything works perfectly and the video is better than I imagined. I have pet hermit crabs in an aquarium in the corner of my room and with night vision I can see them moving, and they are the furthest thing from the camera.

"I struggled to get these cameras to work.  I had to download software in order to download and use other software to be able to communicate with them.  As it is, I have to leave the cameras free-running while recording video.  Also, the video clips are only 1 minute in length .  This means you will need additional video editing software that can merge 50 clips per hour of recording time - across different folders - to create a sequence that you can actually use to review your surveillance.  Further, there's no apparent way to set and maintain an accurate date / time stamp.  If you have to use any footage in court, be prepared to do a lot of explaining.",2,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
These are great cameras. I can’t recommend them enough. Picture quality is fantastic. Sound is very good too. We have four of them. We use them to monitor my father in his nursing home.

I purchased this camera for my daughters wedding which she had chosen on the registry. Its been a nightmare. The camera will not connect to her devices. The instructions are in Chinese only. We live in the United States. They sent an email to return to a certain address but no return code number was given. We have sent an email back asking for this number.

After 3weeks I can access camera using mobile data. Only when I'm at home on wifi network I can access live view. I can only access motion detection using mobile data. Luckily for me I have a wired hikvision system that I haven't decommissioned. I also bought 4 extra of these wyze camera's as I was impressed with picture quality and easy installation.

Apps is easy to use and the setup was just as easy. If I had more rooms I need cameras in I would buy more!The only reason I gave it 4/5 is because of Amazon the price is 19.99 on Wyze.com and 24.99 on Amazon which I didn't like it was higher here. The product is 5/5!",4,1,2019-8-15,1,1,0

I got this camera to see if it can replace my outdoor blink cameras which work great for motion detection.  I set it up in an enclosure to use outside. The motion detection goes off at a slightest dust or a drop of rain. No matter what sensitivity I set it to. This make it useless if you want to use it as a motion detector.

"Simple, fast, cheap and reliable. They are a little harder to connect using Orbi mesh but can still be down.  Have 7 and will buy more.I bought these 4-5 days ago. They had over 13000 reviews. Now they’re back down to 11300. Is Amazon deleting bad reviews?  What’s up with the deletions?",4,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0

"With the virus and my mom in a assisted living facility and the fact I cant go inside right now, this gives me a peace of mind like nothing else can. Its SO TINY yet the picture is perfect!!! We have used it about 3 months now and not once has it failed! I am able to share it with another relative so they can check on her too.I would recommend this 100%.",5,1,2020-7-5,1,1,0
I have this camera in the basement which is where the Xbox lives.  When it’s bedtime I can go in the Wyze camera see my kids and tell them to get to bed.  Makes my life so much easier and helps me enforce bed times.Very happy with the solution,5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
I cannot download the app to use the camera. I've done everything it recommended to download. I sent email to company and have had no response.Update...I finally got the app download and it's working great. I can even share it to husband's email and he can view camera on his phone with the app.,4,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"It didn't take long to set up the camera and App. It's a great system for the price.  Until recently this type of camera system was very costly and required professional installation. The images are HD quality and with 4 little cameras, I can effectively monitor the perimeter of my home.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
Price is great for what it is. Picture quality is good.  Audio is good enough. Haven’t tested the alarm features but since no one else really offers them it’s a nice extra. Setup is super easy.Ability to connect over 5mhz routers would be nice.,3,1,2018-4-16,1,0,0
"The camera just simply doesn’t work like it’s meant to. It will not connect once it’s set up, AT ALL! I have to completely delete and re-link the camera to my app in order to make it connect... for 10 seconds. Once those 10 seconds of connection pass, it gives me the loading sign of death before the app force closes.I will reopen the app and the camera will not connect at all. It tells me to either 1) Exit the app and retry 2) Power cycle the camera 3) Reboot my router.",1,1,2018-12-12,1,2,0
"Wyze Cam. At this stage in their manufacturing life, they are doing it all right. Great products at under market pricing, good tech support, good synergy.As long as they stay with “what brought them,” they can have it all!",5,1,2019-2-28,1,1,0
"Have property where there is no internet available.  Was able to set this up by turning on my phone's hot spot and opening the Wyze app.  Set it to record events to a 32gb SD card and it has worked flawlessly without internet access.  Purchased an outdoor mounting solution for it, put it under an eave, and it has been fine all summer.  Winter might be a different story, but for how little I spent on the camera, I'm not worried about it.",5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"Love this camera, use as a nursery monitor in my toddler’s room. My only complaint is that if you want to take it out of your house (like to grandma’s house or on a vacation), it’s a pain to disconnect from your home WiFi to that of someone else’s for a brief period. Because of this, it stays at home and I bring a non-WiFi baby monitor when traveling. However, it’s an incredible value for the product and I found it easy to set up and use.",5,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"although the video quality is good, the sd card port is defective out of the box. it only records a 12sec. clip if you dont have an sd card installed. it doesn't record all movement. it records like every 5 minutes of detection. i just found out that there's a bad production of this units. i guess this is one of them. it's cheap and you get what you paid for... i dont recommend this security camera.. as long as they havent fix the sd card port issue..",1,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
"Darn tootin! if this ain't the best $27 security camera I ever bought. Sure, it may be the only $27 security camera I bought it is has out surpassed and over come all expectations and stipulations. The sticky mounting pad is my favorite part. Like magic, you can stick it to the bottom of this camera and stick the camera to any worldly surface you can think of. Talk about moving out of the dark ages and into a space age of wonder. I might buy 6 more just to film my every movement so I can finally get down to the bottom of that feeling I experience through out the day, like I am being watched. Maybe I can catch the creature, spirit or person causing such troubles upon my soul .",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
I use this product as a baby monitor at the grandparents house when we are visiting. I bought one for each set of grandparents. I’m honestly SUPER impressed with the quality and the ease of use for its price! I will definitely be purchasing more home security products from them in the future.Only complaint: Occasionally the camera catches “motion” and it’s just a shadow or the sun coming through the window in the room we use but it’s not enough for me to even call it a “con.”,5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"You sure can't beat the price for this camera and I think you get more out of the camera for 25 dollars!

I have bought 2 so far, and plan to buy a couple more",5,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"It is very versatile, inexpensive and easy to handle. 100% recommended. The quality of the video is very good, I have not had any problem with the signal, or with the video. The app where the recordings are seen works very well for me. I have two and I could buy many more!",5,1,2020-3-15,1,0,0
We got this to put in the garage and honestly we haven’t had any connectivity issues at all with our garage being on the lower level and the router being on the next level up.The app works great along with our echo pulling up the picture. No complaints at all and I’ll probably be getting another one of these in the near future,5,1,2019-6-9,1,0,0
"This camera is amazing! I can’t say enough good things about it. I have 3 of these around my house and can check in and see what’s happing from anywhere. It took me less than 5 minutes to download the app and set the camera up, it’s so easy!! If you add the sd card it continuously records and when the card is full it deletes off the back end, holds approx 4 days of recording. The alerts are amazing and allows you to adjust the sensitivity is detection, you can also set up zones to detect motion so you don’t get an alert every time the tree blows around. The only thing I wish was different is the length of the cord, needs to be a little longer.",5,1,2019-9-4,1,0,0
It is hard to connect the camera to WiFi.  I had to try more than 10 times. I rebooted the camera a lot. Finally I had to forget my phone WiFi and reconnect WiFi then camera was able to detect. I never had an issue with Yi camera. I have three Yi cameras. I think Wyze engineer need to fix firmware bugs. But I like Wyze camera design and ease of mounting. Also like free 14 days cloud backup.,3,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"I never expected that this cheap camera would be easy to use, accessible to any device and clear on night vision. Just that sometimes it has its flaws on stopping in the middle of viewing. Also, it has delay when microphone is used. My only concern is that, once the Wyze app has been installed, anyone can view you with your email and password access. I wonder if it got hacked. That’s scary now!",5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
I bought these on my friends recommendation and I am very happy with them. I wanted to keep an eye on my dog during the day while I was at work and this allows me to talk to him and watch him. Easy setup and intuitive app that allows me to make all the changes I desired.Images are from a standard quality stream.,5,1,2019-12-24,1,0,1
"I ended up buying 4 of these after the 1st one worked so well to monitor my sump pump while I am away.  Figure if image goes out, I know power is out and it is time to react with generator.  The 1st picture shown is in a dark utility room in the basement and the night vision is on(sump hole is clearly visible as well as the temperature guage-this picture is virtually identical at night). The other 3 cameras view garages, street, etc and are setup to record on movement detection(adjustable sensitivity).  I can view events and live stream from anywhere so easily with a well designed app on my android.  Takes about 5 minutes to setup each camera..super easy.. you can mount them almost anywhere between the magnet on the camera and the 3m stick pad included.  There are tons of features in the app, too many to list.  The camera description does not do it justice as to what its capable of and all the settings you can change.  Anyways, I recommend this and I never do these recommendation on Amazon, I just really like these, for the price you cannot beat it.",5,1,2019-2-28,1,0,1

"I love these cameras, whereas not the finest on the market but theyre worlds above what you would expect for the price. My only complaints are the app doesnt have a way of going into a security mode where you can see all of your screens active at one time.(multiple cameras). Also the other downside is the APP does not have a version for MAC or PC, it would be a lot better if it did.",5,1,2018-12-3,1,0,0
Ok so I order this small fun looking camera and had high hopes as the packaging was impressive and the camera appears to be made of good quality materials. My excitement was short lived as could not get past the setup stage. I have tried multiple setups using 2.4 and 5 wifi signals. Finally go to their website and find tons of issues with iOS 13. I allowed location services (which is necessary while installing however you can remove after connection). Connected to the 2.4 signal with various devices using the same passcode and all connect fine except this damn camera. I'll update this review if 1)It begins working or 2)I throw it way!!!,1,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"Really great little camera for the price. Motion and sound tracking are VERY sensitive. You can adjust the sensitivity, though I didn't notice a difference when doing so. That said I'd rather have it be too sensitive than not enough. Overall I have recommended it to others and will probably end up buying more of them.",5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"Amazing that this was 20 dollars. I have 3 Nestcams and I HATE them. Total ripoff for the cloud storage, and they CONSTANTLY drop their wifi signal.

"Image quality is very good. Much better than the DLink. I does not have a web interface and relies on servers. As some have reported, it goes through servers that it should not be going through.

This device will not stay connected you must unplug the power and replug the power end to reset it at least once a day.so if I'm working the app for my phone if I'm away from home it always says please recycle power which means physically unplugging and plugging it back in which doesn't do you any good remotely. When it is working it seems pretty decent but you cannot get it to stay connected.,1,1,2019-5-1,1,1,0
"I installed the separate memory card and went through the very easy setup.  It worked really nice for 3 days.  Now it forgot the memory card and night vision is gone.

I've had Nest cameras since before Nest bought the company.  Thee are a whole lot better with better software.  And just look at that price.  I could buy 10 of these for one Nest.

"This thing is great! Picture quality is great (for a webcam at least) and it can record onto SD card for additional footage storage, and best of all is the free cloud storage of footage.

"I don't have a lot of experience with up cameras but this was affordable enough for my to try. We have devastatingly slow internet and it still functions well enough. Night vision works, but not through our window. No subscription fees. Use the right speed sd card (V30 or better). App is pretty intuitive.",5,1,2019-9-8,1,0,0
"This cam works great now, at first it was driving me crazy with sound recordings, but i found out you can shut off sound detection. first go to live feed, click settings icon, then click event recording, that takes you to detects toggles, just toggle off sound. No more sound detection's,  this can be done for video detection's also.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,1
I have set this up at a hummingbird feeder and use motion detection to capture them coming to feed.This camera has good quality in both video and stills. I have it running on a 10k size USB battery. This lasts about 20 hours per charge. As the camera is not weatherproof I bring it at night and charge the battery. Using Tinycam pro software I am able to broadcast it on the web with no difficulties at all. You can't beat this thing.,5,1,2019-4-2,1,0,0
"The speaker is very week so you cant hear anything unless you speak into the camera as well as when you talk from your phone to the camera it sounds really bad. The visual quality is pretty good, I wouldn't say 1080 it looked like 720. And it doesn't turn,  plus it has to be connected to the internet modem for it to turn on and work on my phone. Idk if that's a glitch but I returned it.",2,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
The cameras are very easy to set up and they work great. The picture quality is good for daytime or night time. I bought three cameras and set them up in about 15 minutes. you need the SD card in order to have constant surveillance. One of my cameras died completely after about three weeks. I am waiting for a replacement from the manufacture. Customer service was helpful and said they would send a replacement.  So hopefully they will last a long time. Time will tell.,4,1,2019-1-6,1,0,0

"For the price, these little security cameras can't be beat during the day.  Unless lights are left on, very little detection at nite.  I have a street light so it helps detect on a couple cameras.During daylight, the picture is better than my ring doorbell & alot less hassle.",5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
The second day after set up we lost connection with the camera and could not view from our devices. We rebooted it and have no had a problem since.

I cannot comprehend why anyone would buy ring or blink over this.  I use this as my ring doorbell equivalent. My front door is partially glass and I just point the camera at it.  The motion detection alerts me that someone is there before they even ring the bell. Better yet I get free cloud storage for my videos.  I own everything Wyze makes and couldn’t be more pleased by their products.,5,1,2019-6-5,1,0,0

"I have a Swann system for my business but needed one more camera.  Since my other system has all channels full and I needed one more camera I thought I would try this one since it is wireless.  I ordered a few others and ended up sending them all back because lack of playback, poor quality.  Once I loaded the app, it took about 30 seconds to set this camera up.  I have set up Blink and Swan systems and this was by far the easiest.  I the picture quality is great, the playback is exactly what I needed as well.  I would highly recommend.",5,1,2019-3-18,1,0,0

This really makes it a 3 star for me, but everything else is so good I couldn't bring myself to give 3 stars.Seriously, allow users to view via the web site or something.  It's a friction point in what is otherwise a good user experience.",4,1,2019-2-1,1,0,0
"This product is outstanding for the price and so far durability. The only issue I had was a SIM card went bad and it caused an error code and stopped the camera from working.

We ordered these cameras on a whim and we got a BIG surprise! These are better cameras than Arlo or Nest and cost a fraction of the price! WE have both. They detect both motion and sound up to 100 yards away for us! The night vision is awesome. The only complaint we have is the cord could be a little longer. WE are anxiously waiting for them to come out with a doorbell camera.,5,1,2019-1-3,1,0,0
"This camera is a great inexpensive camera to start with security. Make sure to get a microSD card to expand the onboard storage. One thing to not is the night vision is not that great if it's behind glass like a window due to the infrared light that will reflect on the glass, so keep that in mind. Other than that I was really blown away by the quality of such an inexpensive camera!",5,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
This camera is astonishing and did not expect it to be like that quality. Since I have used many cameras but this is the right camera to use it as home to monitor kids or anything you would like. I have ordered 3 more cameras and must try it out. you won't regret it.,5,1,2020-8-30,1,1,0
Honestly I’ve have the ring doorbell for a while and I wanted something more reliable so I purchased the Wyze Camera and the quality of the camera is amazing as well as the app. There is about a 1sec lag on the video but I have the ring to make up for that 1sec. I recommend this camera and I’ll be adding more to my home.,5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
I bought this for my driveway as my previous one was defective.  It was very easy to set up and install.  I especially  love the picture quality.  I considered buying  other brands but their prices was more than quadrupled what I pay for this unit.  I now have a total of 4 protecting  my home and I couldn't be happier.  Thanks Wyze for making a consumer friendly product.,5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"These little cams are the best. There is NO Subscription cost for this security camera! We use them to monitor our house.

They are the BEST!",5,1,2019-1-18,1,1,0
I am super happy I bought this little camera! At the price it is a very good  indoor camera. It does have to be plugged in but that doesn't bother me because I don't have it running all the time.

"I get it. They are cheap... but the sound quality is bad, if it disconnects from the WiFi “which they do often” they are very annoying to reconnect. Also, it only records 12 second clips.

The audio is OK, passable... but for this price, you're getting a camera 3x-4x the value of what you're paying. The base is magnetic, which is awesome for mounting it in places without drilling holes, and they have a microSD slot for long recording (automatically overwrites as it gets full).",5,1,2018-12-11,1,0,0
I am really impressed with this camera. With the price and the quality this company is really on to something. I have tried other low cost cameras and you really get what you pay for. Not here the camera and the app are first class that can complete with the major leagues. I have the nest system which is the best but it should be and some because of their price and their charges. Not here ..less than $30 and free cloud storage. It is really great to see a company to produce something that has the customer in mind. Without having their profits their #1 goal.,5,1,2018-12-31,1,0,0
"The cameras are sensitive to movement , sometimes overly so. The recent improvement of people detection is a great improvement.

I replaced a Nest Cam with one of these and it works great.  You will not regret this purchase.  The camera configures very easily and very important these days the company updates the firmware as new exploits are found.  The updates do not require that you fetch the camera back which I would need a ladder to get to it.,5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
I purchased one of these after a recommendation by a friend and so far this is a great camera for the price!  I also have several Nest cameras  which start at around $200.  The picture quality is about the same and for the cost I can get 7 for the price on one nest camera.  I also have to pay for cloud storage with Nest.

It also can apparently detect gas and send you warnings. Overall I'm very impressed, and I love it.",5,1,2018-1-4,1,1,0
I was hesitant to order our first camera because it was so inexpensive. The set up was so quick and easy and the camera is worth way more than the price!

I used the plate and sticker to stick to the wall which lasted a few weeks but then fell, so I ended up having to nail it to the wall to hold.

The product developers have a new ""AI"" algo which they developed in association with some Arab professor at UW and installed on the product but that seems to have made the product catch even less images of human or animal approaches.

Setup was quick and easy, and the camera was up and running within a few minutes. The app experience is simple, not alot of fluff, just straight to the point.

Great camera. Picture is always clear wether it’s day or night. It has a wide lens so it casts a long rang to see. One camera covers almost everywhere. Love that its weather proof so I have been able to use it safely outside even in the rain. Motion sensing can be a little too sensitive but it’s better safe than sorry. I wish it was a rotating camera but it’s a great buy for this price.,5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0

This little camera is amazing. I gave the night vision 3 stars because I have the camera inside facing to see outside and when the night vision lights turn on it flares against the window and you  cannot see much of anything.

"Was looking for a low cost solution and this was it!  The ""person"" notification works incredibly.  Was getting false alarms with the ""motion"" alert but Wyze Cam just recently updated the firmware to recognize persons.  IT WORKS PHENOMENALLY!  Get this camera if you need a low cost solution and want something that works.  I looked for over 3 years and finally found this.  Can't say enough about it.  Have it mounted under an eve outdoors and in a silicone case and it works fine!",5,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0
"I am on my second one of these units...had problems with first one and was able to get a replacement since the issues were evident soon after receiving. The second one didn't start having issues until after the return window closed, so now have a unit that works so intermittently it is not a reliable surveillence device. This is unfortunate because I liked it's simple design. I don't know if others who own this are also experiencing problems too or that i just have the unfortunate luck to get two bad ones in a row. Statistical odds suggest the latter option unlikely, so I would say you should look at another product. If it is the latter, than i would hope Wyze or Amazon would contact me to resolve. Multiple reboots, firmware upgrades, etc. do not fix anything.",1,1,2019-3-10,1,0,0
I like the image quality. The app makes it easy to remote in and see. For the money for video you can’t beat this little camera. The only recommendation would to enhance the voice option.  We use it to keep a eye on our fur babies when we are out of the house but when you talk through the camera it comes out garbled. Other then that I am happy with the purchase and would buy another.,3,1,2019-6-14,1,0,0
"I had a Amazon Cloud Cam. this is a second Cloud Cam(Wyze) I purchased with lower cost. it detect movement, but when it does it  record the first 10 seconds or so, then stop - i.e. not record the whole event. the night vision video quality also not as good as I want it to be. cannot see objects clearly 3 meters or further.",2,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0
"For this price this camera is amazing! $25 for HD, night vision and 2way talking? You really can’t beat it. I had another camera in my cart that was $75, but hesitated because some of the reviews were concerning, and I’m so glad I kept searching. We use it to watch our puppy during the day. He’s not alone much, but it makes us feel better when he is, plus we can see if he’s barking when we’re not there. The only thing that I initially  disappointed me was that it has a cord, but it’s not the end of the world. Everything else makes up for it. I seriously couldn’t recommend this enough!",5,1,2019-9-26,1,0,1
"Much better than Blink Mini.I am using mine with a separate, dedicated IR light through a window. I have the option to use night mode while also disabling the IR, which Blink Mini can't do.

Sets up in a couple of minutes, which after spending hours/days/weeks of frustration trying to get my Amcrest cams working reliably, is massively appreciated. Takes a beating - I accidentally dropped one of mine several times on a concrete floor while figuring out where to put it, and it still works.Can't wait for a battery powered external version. I have a Blink XT outside away from a power source which is pretty nice but over 3x the price of these.",5,1,2019-9-4,1,0,0
So I have only had this camera for a day but so far am REALLY impressed. The set up was a breeze and the picture and sound quality match that of my $120 D-Link camera (truthfully I like the lens angle of the Waze better).

These things pack a good value in a small package.  It didn't take me long to set up after downloading the app and having the camera scan the QR code on your phone to sync them is a really neat idea.  You can hide these anywhere with the magnet or the provided magnet and sticky pad.The alerts and playbacks are really good.  You can set the sensitivity to whatever you want.  I like these a lot!,5,1,2018-12-14,1,0,0

This little camera is truly a great option to expensive cameras with great picture quality and night vision as well as free 12s video storage.The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is stability ( it does require reset /restart from time to time and also did not respond well after the updates requiring invasive and intensive troubleshooting). This is a small inconvenience for having a great camera at a low cost. I recommended and I would buy it again when needed.,4,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0

I’ve tried contacting customer support but they want you to navigate on their app. Kicker, if you click off their chat to do as they ask on the app you get disconnected.

Of course it's not made to be outdoors, but it has worked just fine in the Florida wet/humid weather as long as it's covered. I will be buying more of these and can't wait until the doorbell option comes to Amazon. Instead of buying such expensive cameras like Ring, consider this camera, it was a cheaper greater option for me to spy on my cats when I'm out of town.",5,1,2020-10-5,1,0,1
"Great product for a inexpensive price. I was shocked how clear and easy it is to work and put anywhere. It’s extremely sensitive. For example whenever the sun was setting(blinds closed) it would pick up the motion from the sun rays. I would rather it be too sensitive, than the other. Must have a home WiFi to work. The app is very easy to use. No additional money is is needed if you don’t want upgrades.",5,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
These cameras are the best I’ve tried so far. Largely because the app doesn’t crash and become completely unreliable as other ones I’ve tried. We have three of these in the house and use them to check in on our three small children while they sleep. I know other people use them for outdoor and we are thinking of getting another one for that purpose as well.  In general yes I do recommend.,5,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0
"These cameras are great. I bought 2 to give them a shot at in the front and backyard, now I want more. They are very high quality and infinitely adjustable. The magnet in the base is such a great idea. We have metal flashing above our doors and windows so I can just stick them up with no modifications. I'll pull one down and put it in other places temporarily. I used it the other day to watch our furnace as it was acting up. Motion detection works well, but it will grab snow or rain so setting up detection area is essential. I can't believe how good they are for the price though.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,1

I really wish they would be indoor/outdoor as my new blink outdoor cameras are not cutting it at the moment and are 5 times the price of a wyze! For 20 something bucks you're going to want to buy more than one! Good job wyze!",5,1,2019-6-2,1,0,1

For the price I couldn’t ask for a better camera. I purchased the single camera so I could keep an eye on our dogs and cats when we are not home. It allows my dog to have more freedom out of his cage and gives me peace of mind to be able to check on him at any given time.

I have had this cam for just a few months and there are static lines when viewing the camera. Never have we dropped it and it has stayed in the same place ever since we first set it up... I tried turning on/off but the static is still there.

Love this little camera. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the sound quality when you talk though the ap to the room the camera is in is very poor. But that was the feature I was least concerned with. Can’t beat the quality for the price you pay. Most pet cameras are 200$ and up. So this is quite a bargain.

"Really great camera. Similar quality as ring but at a fraction of the price! Not quite sure how weather resistant it is but it has lasted outdoors for a month now. If you get crafty with it, you can hide it virtually anywhere. The app also makes managing your device really simple.",5,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"Cannot be used out of the box to view thru a window, the glass reflects the infrared light back into the lens. Picks up a lot of insects at night. Picks up a lot of movement of plants blown by the breeze. Detects changes in lighting, sunrise, sunset, kitchen lights reflecting on patio, things like that. Be prepared to cut back sensitivity, turn off the sound detection, and also block a portion of the lens if you have trees/shrubs in view.The fact that it works exceptionally well at a reasonable price overrides the negatives.",4,1,2019-1-2,1,0,0
"While not the highest level and function of a high end camera, way better than the average home security cam. The price vs quality earns all 5 stars. Works very well, easy interface on phone. Plan to buy more plus the out door version.  Don't miss the fun off having one.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
Garbage.  Used once and it broke. Didnt find out til after return deadline.  So disappointing.  My techy sons looked it over since i was not confident that i was doing it correctly and they even determined it was malfunctioning. The one time it did work it was nice and clear.  Very disappointed.,1,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0
I love this camera. I love the customer support. The instructions are a little vague and difficult to find but once you got it it is great!  You do have to turn off night vision if you want it to see through a window which I figured out only by luck.,5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0

I currently have four (4) of their cameras on my home network.  After several time consuming troubleshooting routines customer service now thinks that it’s my network... they want me to call my ISP and ignores the fact that I have four (4) other cameras on the existing network.

It is like if it were covered or if its volume had been set to the very minimum.  I contacted support and followed all the suggested steps with no success. I'm still waiting for their follow-up.",3,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0

These things are stupid cheap and awesome. So easy to setup and they just work. I am using Samsung high endurance SD cards with these and they work great with pretty quick playback. I hope to see a future update with a little bit more customization with the motion zones. but for now i am more than happy with the insane value of these things.,5,1,2018-12-22,1,0,0
Product required information that I felt uncomfortable relinquishing for it to work. I kindly declined and stuffed this damn thing as far as I could into the box and returned. I got an average infrared hunting camera instead. It doesn't ask me if I've brushed my teeth today.: (,1,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0

Definitely a 5 star review.  Extremely fast shipping. Set up was 10 min with iPhone 7.  Very impressed with quality of pic and sound .  Wide angle view seems to be good in multiple lighting conditions.  Writing this review only after a couple days so can not comment on reliability.  Live streaming is great and free .  Of course streaming depends on your internet.  Buying another .,5,1,2018-8-17,1,0,0

Love these cameras. The price is unbeatable. At the price point it give you the confidence to experiment with different setups and not be too worried about damaging or losing a $100+ cam. The support is excellent and the app and features continually get better. I can't stop buying them!,5,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0
We've only had the camera up for a few days but I am very impressed with it. Picture quality  is really good for such an inexpensive camera. It catches sound and motion very well. Extremely easy to set up and super simple system to use. You gotta love the free cloud. For the price and how happy we are we will be buying a few more.,5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
I’m really impressed with this product for the price. Very convenient that I can control it from my I Phone when I am away from home. It’s very sensitive to movement.,5,1,2019-7-9,1,1,0
"Great little camera. Easy to set up. Would work well as a ""baby"" sitter. My babies are all grown and gone. Good range. Works only on your phone but can work on multiple phones. I bought the enclosures and will place them outside but in a sheltered area. I have ordered more.",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"Absolute junk. Setup was sick and easy but that was it. It never connected whether on wifi or not. Once it actually connected it then disconnected right away and couldn't reconnect.

"Camera works excellent. I have three of the v2 for my store. Picture quality could be little better for 1080p.  Overall 5* .Hint: for future buyer, you need to get sandisc microSD as it mentions, off brands won't work for recording.",5,1,2020-9-26,1,1,0
I have had many security cameras over my years. Wow This one is perfect! So easy to set up with Alexa.  The price is great. Its nice and small. The picture is crystal clear. There is also sound and night time vision. IFY- If your wifi goes down  so does the picture but once your wifi comes up the picture comes is up again.,5,1,2019-2-8,1,0,0
Perfect indoor camera for the price. This is what you want to start out with if you are a first time buyer. I can customize the sensitivity of motion and sound detection. I can also customize notifications so when the camera picks up motion/sound I get an alert (I have it set so motion detection alerts from 10pm to 6am). I have not tried this outdoors. Night vision quality is very clear.,5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
At first this camera recorded everything from every motion to every sound... in December it’ll be a year since I’ve had it.. and recently I’ve noticed that my camera doesn’t record everything anymore... I would go back to check my events and it will be missing time frames for example.. I checked it before I wrote this review and this is what it recorded 12am-3am then 10am-2pm so it literally didn’t record 6 hours of footage... and I’m very disappointed by that.. my point of this whole camera was to catch everything when I’m away from home or anything... so I don’t know.. and it’s not a storage thing..,2,1,2020-8-30,1,0,1
"If you  are technical/gadget knowledgeable,  this could very well be a great product, but for a non technical/ gadget person like me, it is far to complicated.  I could not  figure out how to get it to work correctly.  There is no user manual that i can find, and no telephone support,  and it takes several days to get a response from an e-mail.They do have a user form, where i got some help,  but for me that doesn't really qualify as support.",2,1,2019-3-14,1,0,0
"Good and cheap. Perfect little camera for monitoring a room. There’s a delay on when motion is detected and you get a notification so I would not trust this to be the solution to preventing a robbery, but it does a good job recording what it can see and backing it up. You’re then able to download the video that you would need from the internet. Very solid camera.",4,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
Just ordered July 12th and of course it stops working after the return window. Hoping Wyze will still stand behind its product and send a replacement or offer a refund.,1,1,2019-9-19,1,1,0
The camera is really cool and very user friendly especially with pairing with cellular phone. The big takeaways though.. the sound is very bad trying to speak thru it either close or far is very muffled and lags big time. And pairing with amazons echo show is a bust.. I can not access the camera at all so that was a bit of a let down especially since it’s advertise to do so... but for the price it’s a good camera/security etc.,4,1,2019-1-7,1,0,0

"I used this for my kid's sleep training. It worked perfectly, just as well as the cameras that over $100. It has all the functions I needed. The only issue is that when you watch playback, the video and audio doesn't match. But that's not a big deal for me. I also take one with me on travel when my baby is with me.

Fantastic and better than the last brand I purchased at the same price point because they haven’t started charging for their app services like the other company has which is ideal on a budget. Better picture quality than the competing cameras at this price as well.,5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
This camera is great because you can put an sd card it in a can play back the previous days activities. The night vision is amazing compared to other cameras and for the price this one is hands down a better option. I purchased one to see how I liked it and ended up getting 4 for throughout the home. I previously had a really expensive baby monitor that kept going out and losing connection which is why I started looking for other options. Being able to peek in on your kiddos or home while away is also such a great feature and puts my mind at ease anytime I am out.,5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
An excellent camera for when you’re away. I have it set high in my living room and I can see the entire room plus most of the kitchen. When people come to check on my house it’s very easy to see them. The night vision and low light vision works very well. Very easy to install. The software works well.,5,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
I bought this as a cheaper alternative to alot of other cameras and we love it! The picture quality is pretty good and incoming sound is good also! When you talk through your phone to the camera it's a little weird sounding but I dont use that feature much.

I've tried the Yi Home camera as a comparison and this is by far the best 'budget' home camera ecosystem. Great app which is simple to use and the camera is great quality in both build and image. I mostly use this for pace of mind while I am out of the house and to watch my dog. There is no need to spend more than $20-30 on a camera for my needs!,5,1,2019-4-29,1,0,0
Great quality product for the price. Wyze customer service seemed to be local and very pleasant to work with. Clear video and love the options to record to my phones gallery and still have it saved on my SD card. I like that you can also speak through it and I use it to keep an eye on my dog. He’s a good boy but some times a little too curious. The look on his face is priceless when I nag at him through the camera from my phone while I’m at work.,5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0

"Not only the camera is reasonable, it also does come with basic cloud storage free for life for 3 day events. Most cheap camera's sell the camera only to later make you pay for the cloud service.  The Wyze app is pretty simple to setup, adding multiple cameras is also very easy, all the menu, settings and options are simple to understand and most importantly integrates with google home. Just go for I have had one for over a year and still working perfect. Also you can add a microSD card for local storage.

Love this camera! I use it as a pet camera when I’m gone long days or over nights. Night vision and 2 way sound is fun! I do notice the camera itself runs pretty warm so I’m cautious about what surfaces I leave it on. I keep it turned off for that reason and only turn it on when I want to check in.,5,1,2019-12-4,1,1,0

Horrible product. I bought 5 and had them for 4 months. The Camera stops working if its not restarted frequently. The video is out of sync with the audio on the SD cards. The motion and sound detection notifications take a long time to get to your app. The motion and sound detection does not integrate with Alexa routines. I'm glad I didn't sell my old wifi cams.,1,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"This is a solid built camera, small but powerful. Setup is very easy.However, it seems like it only captures a certain amount of time when motion is detected.

I cannot claim personal experience with other cameras of this type but I just cannot think of anything else one could ask at this price level.

You seriously couldn't get a better camera for the price of the Wyze Cam.

Has sound while watching it, has a audible alert set off by sound or motion and records for almost as long as the DVR mentioned above with a 32 gig mini SD card! I can zoom in an incredible amount without losing much resolution at all.I just had a small malfunction in one of the Wyze Cams and the support for that was same day response and a replacement is on its way with no big problem for me.

Both of my Wyze Cam V2 did not recognize the Wyze 32Gb sd card.  Cameras appears to work fine except the can't read the sd cards.  I have since found online there appears to be this recurring issue.  I have contacted Wyze customer support online waiting on their response.  Received the items today.,1,1,2019-7-15,1,0,0
Great little camera!! Being magnetic makes it easy to put anywhere you want it to be. Plus the way you can move twist and turn it is very convenient. You will need a SD card to have it store any playback. Works great if you want a baby monitor and want real time footage on your phone.,5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"This is a great little camera.  Decent video quality, ability to communicate through it remotely, and very simple to setup.I would call this one of those ""best bang for the buck"" products.  It isn't the greatest thing ever but for the price you can't beat it.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0

"Awesome camera for an add on to Xmas gift. Great day and night picture and sound quality. However, motion detection is wayyyyy off. We are constantly getting notifications all day long of motion when no one is home. We review and there was nothing. We had to change the time to detect motion to only when our so. Is in bed. (We use it as a baby monitor).",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
The quality you get for the price is unheard-of. Even at night the clarity is stellar. I'm also impressed with how easy the app is and the motion detection. Took a month before my wife knew it was there lol she also loves it and wants more. If you insist!,5,1,2018-11-1,1,1,0

I have some Ring cameras outside and a simplisafe camera downstairs but wanted one upstairs to keep an eye on our cats and didn't want to spend a bunch. This is definitely worth the money and I would say better than my other ones that all cost $200 each. I wish I had gotten this first. It sends notifications for motion but it records everything so I can watch something that may not have sent a notification for (which my expensive ones don't)  And the cloud storage is free unlike most,5,1,2019-1-17,1,0,0
For the price you can’t beat these little cameras. For the price that have great quality compared to other cameras in the hundreds of dollars. They are not the best built quality and have horrible sound and forget trying to talk to someone which comes out almost like static.

"Great security camera. Motion detection is great. Need to improve; how to use the camera functions. The videos recorded to SD card needs a better layout, similar to the cloud layout.

We bought this camera so we can keep an eye on our backyard while on vacation but it was slow and it wouldn't stay connected to our internet.  We had to turn everything that was connected to out internet off just to get a picture of the back yard but it would still buffer the image.  We returned this item.,1,1,2019-3-15,1,0,0
Can't buy a better camera for the money. It's worked flawlessly from day one. I don't use these so much for a camera as a motion sensor to automate lights.

"Ordered this camera and did not get to use it until just recently due to a move. The camera is great with a bunch of fantastic features.

I just bought this camera and previously bought the Wyze Pan as well. I was a little skeptical about purchase after reading some of the reviews . Once I received this camera and installed it . I can honestly say I am a fan of this product . For the price point and ease of installation there is no comparison . Both of cameras work seamlessly together . I can monitor everything via my phone . My main reason for purchase is that I have a young daughter who travels home from school alone sometimes and I wanted to insure she is safe when she arrives. This does the trick.,5,1,2019-3-28,1,0,0

I didn't like the way this worked at all and was slow to track movement. The picture was grainy and the quality seemed flimsy. Would not order again.

"I've had this product for over a year now, and it still works phenomenally. The picture is crystal clear in daytime or night. I recommend to keep out of direct sunlight to avoid a glare a video playback.ALSO, this camera must be used with a private internet connection. A hotspot will work, but the video playback lags and is not using the full potential of the camera.

Frame rate 15 fps default and 10 with night vision. I use the cam for a baby monitor  just to look in on a toddler new to sleeping with a blanket. Picture quality is great so long as it's a steady image. But quicker movments are completely  lost to the lens. IR rang on night vision is great and clear. Motion detection  and sound detection work good and require trial amd error setting up the sensitivity. But totally recommend this for indoor use of any kind,5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0

"My favorite amazon purchase EVER! After failing to figure out the set up process of not one, but two different cameras, this was such a breath of fresh air! Set up process took less than 5 minutes! Camera came with a magnet with a sticker on one side so you can set this camera up on any surface. The base is even magnetic so you can literally put it anywhere! Picture quality is great! Didn’t think about this before I purchased, but it does have to stay plugged in to the wall. Not a big deal for me and where I set it up, but it’s good to know. Now I can check in on my pups any time-day or night! Love love love this camera! Need one for every room in the house!!",5,1,2019-6-12,1,0,0
I can say that this was a big shock of a purchase for the amount of money I paid. For it being so cheap I had low expectations and this camera blew it out of the park!

This camera works as a monitor but terrible for home security. The motion detection alert only records 12 seconds and half of that is before the motion starts.

Was recommended this camera by my coworker who is very tech savvy. Took me a while to figure out how to set up the features but really happy with it overall! My camera is plugged into an outlet next to the front door and the wire is slim enough to fit through the door crack and allow me to set it up outside. Picks up motion and noise very well so I can see if someone's outside my door immediately. Just bought a second one for the inside of my apartment too. Perfect for apartments where maintenance comes in frequently and gives me a peace of mind.

This is a great camera for the price. I have been using this camera for about 6 months now and it is awesome! Outstanding really. Set up is easy and I am not a techy person. Anyone can set this up in about 10 minutes. App is full of features and simple to use. I really want to purchase the 360 version next. If you are thinking about getting this do it!,5,1,2019-6-23,1,0,0
"For it’s price I’m very satisfied for the job it does. The camera comes with just what you need, nothing more, nothing less.Picture quality is good everything is clear and visible. It’s not 4K but it’ll do fine. Setup is a breeze and the App is great.",5,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
Have to constantly force stop the app in order for it to connect sometimes as many as 7 times in a row before I can view the Room. I have the proper SD card in it yet it will not do time lapse recording which makes it useless.,1,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0

I put this in the children's playroom/schoolroom! This has been so helpful to check in on them without knowing. I also can use it when I am not home and talk very clear with them through it! Adding an SD card will let me record movement!,5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0

Awesome!  I can't believe this is so affordable.  We use this for our puppy (who has magically escaped his crate) to keep an eye on him when we are gone. The video is so clear and being able to hear him and talk back to him when he is crying has really helped calm him down when he is alone.If and when I find use for more I will definitely purchase more...and recommend to my friends and family!,5,1,2018-2-19,1,0,0
"This camera will NOT send motion or sound detection notifications. I now see some people have had the same problems and I wish I would have read that before buying this camera.

I find the cameras work good for first couple weeks then half the time they stop  Recording . When I try and go back to review things picked up on the camera the material is not longer there to view.

"I worked with Wyze support for days trying to troubleshoot as to why I never received an event recording or notification.  I tried all of their suggestions, went through the user forums and nothing ever worked.  Their best suggestion was to turn off detection for a ""person"" and then move in front of the camera and see if that worked.  It didn't.  It seems like you have to get lucky with a camera that works and have your app settings set in the most perfect way, and then it MIGHT work.  Why the camera and the app aren't set to the best settings from the beginning are beyond me.",2,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
This is the camera all other cameras wish they could be.  We now have 4 cameras plus 2 door sensors and 1 motion sensor.  Everything for less than $125!!!  Set up is incredibly fast and simple.  Wish they had come out with this product years ago.  Get Wyze!!,5,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0
"The BEST $20 I’ve ever spent!! These cameras have absolutely amazing quality, and very easy to use. Before finding these I have another camera system that I spent $300 for 3 cameras. It’s a good system but my Wyze cameras are so much more user friendly, and picture is just as good! You can speak through them and have yet to have a problem with communicating through them. If you are in the market for a camera BUY THIS ONE!! I purchased 2 of them on Black Friday $20 each. So wish I would have gotten more. Getting ready to order 3 more now!",5,1,2019-3-15,1,0,0
Great price. Good picture quality. I bought two. One of them had issues. I would set the camera to detect motion and every couple of days I would go into the app to check the settings and motion detection would be turned off. I would turn it back on and within a couple of days it would be off again. Not good having a camera that doesn't detect motion.  I ended up returning the camera and got it replaced with a new unit. I will update this review after I run the new camera for a while.,3,1,2019-1-24,1,0,0
"Very easy to set up, had for several months, own 3 now.  Will buy another.  Many  more settings than one would expect for the price.  I point them out windows and turn off night light and set timer to not forward notiafter dark.  You can set the area on the screen you want watched for movement. Literally everything ring can do but not an outside (unprotected) camera.  Great value.",5,1,2019-2-4,1,0,0
I cannot begin to tell you how fabulous this camera is!!!! Beyond my expectations. For the price it’s just unreal. Just as good or better than the expensive ones. Great picture quality. Always get my alerts. I love it!!! And it was super easy to set up!!!!,5,1,2019-9-2,1,0,0

"I have six of these cameras and two of them keep corrupting the SD cards that allow you to record video locally. This means I cannot record video on two of these cameras. This also means these SD cards are wasted (as they will not restore). I searched the web and there are lots of people who have experienced the same problem.

Read reviews and thought it was going to be great although with the price I thought it was too good to be true! Unfortunately I was correct.

It's the best cheap camera money can buy. It's simple and gets the job done. Nothing fancy or advanced features. We use it to keep an eye on our baby at night to make sure he's sleeping and can keep track how many times baby cries or stirs in his sleep by looking at playback with motion and sound notificstions. It won't wake you up because it's just a phone notification alert. We use dedicated simple baby monitor to wake us up if crying isn't loud enough to reach our bedroom. App is super simple and isn't buggy. I'll keep buying more around the house!,5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0

Motion capture could use some work and there should be an option to capture longer videos.  Most of the time the motion that triggers the cam is gone out of frame by the time it records it. That is with me adjusting sensitivity and motion zones. It’s still 5 stars because I can view what’s saved in the sd card through the app. Overall, great cam. Can’t wait for the outdoor rated models!",5,1,2019-7-4,1,0,0
This device lags a lot and I have seen that night vision and motion sensing is not really good. I see there is too much lag in video monitoring frames forget about recording. Cheap product. Amazon camera works much better. I have 3 of them but this one is low profile camera.,2,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0

"So far it has been pretty nice in testing. Need to give it some more time, but seems like a pretty well made product for the price. Only reason 4 stars is the night vision was detecting a lot of false motion triggering alerts, otherwise it's been very good.",4,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0

Small footprint and lightweight enough to be attached to window. Picture quality is good. Can make out people well but not HD quality. (The more expensive Wyze can can do that). Also annoy swivel so have to position it just right but angle is wide enough to get great views,5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"This camera works very well and has great features for the price. It’s too big to go unnoticed, but that isn’t a priority for my use.

Otherwise, this does the job at minimal expense.",4,1,2019-4-28,1,0,0
So i got this about a month ago and have to say I'm really happy I got this the picture 📷 quality is good the video 📹 quality is good the fact that it has a build in speaker and microphone 🎤 is awesome and setting it up is a breeze the app is great the only thing I don't like about the app i have 3 cameras and I can't see all of them together in one frame i have to click on each one to view the other then that great product highly recommend this product will be buying other stuff as well.,5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
Good product. Software service should include various options like continuous capture and set own interval limited between two consecutive captures. It is default to around 5 minutes before it detect next motion. And within the 5 minutes it only captured 10s -30s video. So it may miss out the main clipping that would be useful in case it’s video ever become needed. But for the price and night vision it is great product and concept,3,1,2019-4-1,1,0,0
"The camera is pretty good during the day with clear video and timely alerts (compared to a Yi cam). But the night time image quality kills it. I have it set up inside a window facing out, so can't use the infrared (same as my Yi cam). The Yi cam beats the Wyze at night hands down.Bottom line is if it doesn't work at night it's useless to me, because the shenanigans I've caught on camera (with the Yi) have been at night.",1,1,2018-12-7,1,1,0

Got new cards and the the cameras would disconnect even after stepping down to 360.  More on-line “chat” without fixing the problem.

I have had hawks, foxes, and coyotes kill and attempt to kill my birds, and the fact that I have to come home every day wondering whether I will find a few if not all of them dead is never a fun feeling. This puts my mind at ease. I can't praise them enough. They are a life saver to me when it comes to protecting my flock and I'm sure within the next month or 2 I'll be buying more.

Put in the garage when I had workers working on the entry room because of what I had stored in the garage.  This product recognizes changes in pixels not really motion.  There were a few times where it cuts out before the person leaves the room. but overall you cannot beat the price for what this product offers.,4,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0
This security camera has excellent night vision and the picture quality is phenomenal but I can't  get it to work most of the time.  The only time I can get the camera to work is when I am home which does me no good.,1,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0

I needed something quick to put up and keep watch on my Amazon packages. It's doing a great job of that. The person detection is especially cool. It helps keep the notifications down by only letting you know when a person has walked by.,4,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
Complete junk. Will not stay connected. A serious lag in detection and notifications. I have business class wifi and this thing wont stay connected 15 feet away for longer than a minute or two at a time. Dont waste your time or money,1,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"This is a great little camera. Setup is pretty easy, I wish there were a wifi WPS option instead of typing my wifi password, but that is not a big deal.  The video quality is very good.  I also have a Logi camera that was much more expensive, but I like the Wyze cam better.",5,1,2018-4-28,1,1,0

This is a pretty good camera for the money. The night vision is bad but we don’t have a lot of lighting outside our house. However it’s great for the daytime or for using in the house. You can see everything on the app on your phone. I would recommend this product.,4,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
I like the small size and maneuverability of the stand. I set mine in a window sill with very little room and it works like a charm. I record locally to a 64 GB MicroSD card which took me forever to figure out how to format properly to FAT32. Wyze app playback is hit or miss and hard to control.,5,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0

Camera is nice. The app can be a little spotty. They seem to be having some sort of issue with its motion capture ai software developer.Make sure to get an sd card. It will record video until the card is full at which point it replace old footage with new.,4,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"The application for setup is the worst. I even had others attempt and failed. Today's technology allows the camera to focus on the barcode. This application has you guessing the lineup without allowing the customer a visible and viable outlet. Also does not allow for a manual input. In the end, I place it back in the box. The plan was to test it and buy several others. This is no longer an option.",1,1,2018-12-4,1,0,0

It can zoom in right on the crib and I spoke in a low tone to see if my sister could hear everything in the room from far away. Sound is perfect! I turned on the detection features and got a notification when it saw me move from my bedroom in a crack through the nursery’s door. I am so happy I did a little research and decided on this camera. Once baby no longer needs a baby monitor we will be moving it to be a security camera for one of our doors. So many excellent uses and the best part is no monthly fees!

They have a few glitches from time to time but for the price they can't be beat. I use my old iPad mini 2 as a viewer for 4 of these cameras and my iPhone while I am out to watch the front door of my house and my dogs while I am at work and they work great. Highly recomend,5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
This has to be one of the best and easiest camera to set up. Very good price for this camera after comparing  others. Best part was not having to pay for any cloud services to use it. Totally free no monthly fee after camera purchase (l did add a 32GB micro SD card for video storage. Make sure to get one high quality that can handle continuous video over lapping if you're leaving the camera on continuous). I'm not using it on the Motion Detection setting so I'm not able to review that function.,5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"When you actually want this camera on, it's a pretty neat product. Good sounds and video.THAT SAID, it routinely turns itself on! I've contacted Wyze and they had me unplug/replug and then do a factory reset -- NEITHER WORKS and the camera KEEPS TURNING ITSELF BACK ON AFTER I TURN IT OFF. I've now taken to having a towel over it when I'm home because I don't trust that it's actually off.",1,1,2019-4-19,1,1,0
"Great little camera, does what those that cost much more do. The only issue I'm having is that the switch from night vision recording to full color sometimes sticks. It never fails to record though. Easy setup.",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
"I have a very smart house (12 dots, 15 lights, some smart plugs and switches, roomba, Ring doorbell, etc).  These little cameras are a great addition...especially at this price.  Easy to install, easy to configure, great video.",5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0

Love this camera for what I paid for it. Like getting notifications on my phone when someone is in my yard or my porch. I can always see what’s going on at home while I’m working. Great day time picture but not a good picture at night.,5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
Was a good camera up till the point my mom heard someone talk through it.,1,1,2019-12-12,1,1,0
Nice little camera.  Great picture and the features in the app are nice.  Requires aftermarket fixture to mount outside.  2.4ghz and 5ghz compatible.  Works with any micro sd card but performs best with a 32gb.  I plan to by a few more.,5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
Mine wouldn't pair with my phone and technical support was worthless except to identify that the unit was defective.  I seems to me that the QA gets worse and worse on this cheap junk we're getting out of China.,1,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"Good camera for the price. If the SD gives you any trouble it may be defective, I had to return one of these to get a replacement capable of writing data to the card. It would see the card but wouldn’t detect motion or write data. Also only use a 32 GB card to avoid problems.",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"The simplicity of the app and quality of the picture is quite good. My only criticism would be that the audio quality is just OK, but not a deal breaker since my main concern is seeing what's going on. It is super easy to set up and doesn't require any upkeep. Highly recommend.",4,1,2019-4-29,1,0,0

"These worked great until our WiFi connection went out for 5 seconds *once*. Then they could never connect to the repaired network again, even after a hard wipe. A quick look at their support forums shows that this problem is hugely common. Their solution was a very intense, hardware related and external component-required wipe of SD cards. For a $30 camera I am not going to buy $50 worth of outboard gear to fix them. My emails to tech support were completely ignored.",1,1,2019-8-16,1,0,0
"It fails to detect people about half the time.  It occasionally fails to detect motion.  The app is decent.  Overall, really great affordable alternative to the crazy expensive premium devices with their monthly fees.",4,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
I put one of these in the nursery and it's great for keeping an eye on the little one but a soothing way to talk to your infant it is not. The audio sounds like a broken drive thru speaker at a fast food restaurant. We ended up leave the old baby monitor in the room to listen and talk and we use this for video. If only the audio could be half as good as the camera this would be perfect.,4,1,2019-2-7,1,0,0
"Great, great camera. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles that the higher end ones have but at its very best its simplicity is its strong point. I added the Mini SD card and the play back is decent. The initial HD quality is really good and set up was so simple.  Motion and Sound detection is spot on. The speaker is weak but I don't think most people would use the two way option, its too small and not clear. The microphone is crazy good, I was a good amount away from the camera and it picked me up in another room like I was right next to it o_O. So affordable, I bought it after friend showed me theirs on their phone, 1 min later it was ordered.",5,1,2018-3-15,1,1,0

"This little camera was the best inexpensive camera I could've purchased. I purchased this camera for my nursery, and it has been great.

Mind you, I've only had the camera 2 days, but so far, I have no complaints.",5,1,2019-4-1,1,0,0

"I purchased several of these to guard the perimeter of my property. Free storage of motion for several days is a nice incentive (other camera services charge for this). Night shot mode works OK, if camera is close to the action. Bugs set it off motion detection at night.

I bought two of these at different times. Works great 24/7. Night vision is very impressive for $25. I bought sd cards separately to record playback. Don't fall for the motion detection capability - it's only a 14 day free trial.,5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0

It took me 5 minutes to operate everything.  It also has a weather proof housing unit for this to go in for 11 dollars to put outside.  This unit has everything...notifications on movement,sound,and much more.  Buy this product before the price goes way up.  Because it will eventually...it’s worth way more than 25 bucks!!!",5,1,2018-12-11,1,0,0

All it takes is for one other person in my apartment to be using the 2g network and the camera immediately disconnects and refuses to fix itself.

The cameras present a very good solution to security and personal remote viewing. The price is super and the build quality good. The memory card is a bit of a problem. Sometimes not recognized.

"Bought this unit after a few co-workers had recommended. Was just looking for something to monitor the front door of the house. This unit is very small and takes up very little space. There is a little pull out leg that helps elevate the camera to get a better viewing angle. Easy out of the box setup. Plug into power, Open the Wyze app and press the Setup button on camera.

Little did I know this camera has all the bells and whistles of a more expensive camera!  When I check the room I can hear if someone is in it. I can also talk via the speaker! That’s a feature I didn’t need but think it’s great!  Overall I’m surprised at the quality of the camera and it’s offerings, as I only paid $25 for it. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to spy on their pet.",5,1,2019-5-10,1,0,0

"Loved this thing ever since I got it. MUST have WIFI. WIFI is spotty where Im at, so it really renders the camera useless. You need to have a stable, normal WIFI connection to use this.

I did not think that the picture quality would be as good as it is for how inexpensive this was. I bought this so that I can keep an eye out on my new dog and so that I could get notifications anytime the dog moved around or made noises. I like that there is a microphone option that that I can talk to my dog if I need to. I am extremely satisfied with this product and am happy with the price I got it for.,5,1,2019-7-8,1,0,1

Which is nice sound is an added bonus. Highly recommend for a pet cam",5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,1
"This is a great little camera, especially for the price.  The picture is good, the functions, so far, are easy to use. I haven't tried to use all the settings, notifications, etc. yet. The only negative thing I can say is the sound quality isn't great, speaking through it or listening to it. And sometimes it seems to lag a little but that's probably our slow internet speed. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.",5,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0

I Bought this to use as a baby monitor and it does the job perfectly. This is far more affordable than other video baby monitors.I love that I can watch it from my phone and also that it has two way audio.There does seem to be a few seconds lag on the audio but that doesn’t bother me.The picture is clear and the sound is actually lower than it would be if you were standing in the room.I would definitely buy this camera again.I added three pictures one is during the day with the curtains closed and it’s still really clear with a little light.Then two at night one with the night vision turned on it and one with out so you could see how much of a difference there is.,5,1,2019-2-26,1,0,1

UPDATED REVIEW in 2020. My wonderful camera just stopped working from nowhere and it is impossible to connect again even after trying all the troubleshooting available from the Wyze team support and they told me sorry they couldn’t help anymore after I tried everything they suggested and still no solution.Review from 2018: I just wanted a camera for baby’s room and it is perfect for that. Super easy to set up.,1,1,2018-5-6,1,0,1
I bought this cam due to its reviews and mainly because of its product write up.  It states it’s an indoor WIRELESS smart home camera in its description.  I was disappointed to find out that it needs to be plugged in to work.,2,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
First the cameras are great for the price. Easy to set up and get running. I have set up clinton electronics and vivotek cameras ect. I currently have a vivotek IP cam that was 900 dollars  its a claimed 5MP full HD. These little WYZE cameras have just as good or better picture for 25 bucks.  If  you want a simple indoor camera solution you cant go wrong for the money. Just need an outdoor version to come out.,5,1,2018-12-25,1,0,0
Nice camera for now but i think i need Geo-fencing. I have been using these for a month and they are good in all aspects except that i want them to know that i am home and let it work with Google home.,4,1,2017-12-15,1,2,0

Read some bad reviews about the motion detection, I would have to say they’re pretty on point. No issues so far with motion detection. Picture quality actually blew me away. These are our first security cameras so we really didn’t know what to expect. I will definitely buy more. Setup was easy as hell and connecting to Alexa was cake as well.",5,1,2018-12-26,1,0,0

Better to spend around $100 and get a quality surveillance product.",1,1,2018-12-19,1,1,0
"Small and easy to hide, can be attached almost anywhere, and easy setup. Only thing you'll need is an SD memory card and possibly a longer power cord depending on where it is that your wanting to put it. The one that it comes with is fairly long itself.

"I was skeptical of the price but after getting it, testing it and installing it and having it for about a month it works great. I have only had a minor issue with firmware updates which is small because I had to run them twice but other than that it's been fantastic.

Left it out last week in Chicago when it was -50 below with wind chills and not once did it fail or give off false alarms. Worked like a charm. The pan and tilt one is also excellent and the price is crazy $30.,5,1,2019-2-5,1,0,1
"We've been using it for a while now. It's pretty good at detecting motion. It saves the event, and notifies me & my partner. I can then save the file to my icloud drive. It overwrites the previous days'-worth of event files with the current days events. I haven't installed an SD card, yet.It is set up inside our house, so it is looking through a window and a screen. The images/picture quality are distorted because of that, particularly at night when there are a lot of reflections.",5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
"Bought 4 of these. Returned one after trying to set it up the first time. Now approximately 35 days or so after getting them, one has dropped connection and no matter what I try it will not reconnect. Basically dead. Another that I have an SD card in has begun recording intermittently with every card I have tried.I liked the way these are supposed to work. Just a shame they won’t do so for very long.

"For $20 this is all you need in a camera. The app is user friendly, setup was a bit difficult, I believe it was because a firmware update was needed. Since we bought it,  o problem at all.

This is a great little camera for the money. I wish I could record more than 12 seconds on the clips but I will get an SD card and just watch longer sections if I need to.

"I just had this for one day and I am already beyond impressed wih this camera. It has all the qualities and features of a $100 camera. The only minor feature request that I can think of is this: The motion or sound alert can be customized based on time of the day only, and not day of the week. It means I have to manually turn it on and off during the week and on weekends. I wish it was possible to automatically turn it off on for some days of the week and on for others.",5,1,2018-5-5,1,0,0

Hard to beat this camera for features and performance at this price point. I also have the Arlo Pro camera and probably would purchase the Wyze again before buying another Arlo. For the price of one Arlo Pro system you can purchase 10 of this cameras and you would have a hard time stating that one was better than the other for picture quality or feature-set. Have been using it for about a month now and am very pleased. Planning on purchasing one or two more to complete coverage of property both inside and out.,5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"initially thought this was going to be a great camera. Set up was pretty simple. At home, images came right up on my phone. Needed, like most folks, to be able to view while away. The Wyze app kept asking me for password. Then kept saying it was incorrect. So created new PW, and same thing....it won't allow login from offsite. So if you want to watch yourself at home where the cameras are, great! Otherwise, it is a waste. And I really hate seeing other comments re/being 'spied on' or secretly watched by some weirdos who have nothing else to do!",1,1,2019-7-14,1,0,0
I liked the wyze cam as it is affordable compared to other security cameras and the quality of audio and video are good. It does detect motion well. Since it records about 12 seconds video in cloud and skips for another 2-3 minutes after each detection so it misses some video footage without  external memory.  But overall a good buy.,4,1,2019-3-7,1,0,0

Works great and was easy to set up. Provides a reasonable field of vision and the picture quality is VERY good considering the low price. I use the app on my iPhone to keep an eye on my dogs when I leave them alone for a while. Picture is easily detailed enough and the motion capture picks up any movement.,5,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0
I live this camera! The subject needs to be within 20 feet to trigger the motion detection but other than that it's amazing and the monthly service gives me twice the cloud storage at half the cost of my last security camera.,5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0

"It's a good camera, but the app is horrible and it's the only way you can use the camera.  You get 14 days of free storage of clips, but no option to buy more storage.  The app rarely connects with the camera if not on the same wifi.  When you back out of one camera to go to another one the entire app closes and you have to reopen it.It's a 20 dollar camera, for that price it's ok, and if they fix the crappy app it would be pretty good",2,1,2019-1-1,1,0,0
For the price these cameras are pretty decent.  My complaint is you need to use their app to view the video.  By default they don't stream using a standard other programs can read.

We use this as a baby cam. The night vision and motion alerts work amazingly well.

"The picture quality is great.  The audio is not worth even mentioning.  I mounted it outside in an outdoor enclosure.  So far weather hasn't been a problem.  I like the ability to adjust the detection zone.  A problem with the detection is that it picks up shadows from trees and sends me alerts multiple times through the day.

For the price you can’t beat it! It was easy to connect and tied in with Alexa I am using it to monitor a digital read out on a freeze dryer. It works great. I liked it so much I just ordered 3 more and one Wyze Pan!,4,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
Wyze is a new company with an interesting vision and business model.  They all about community and building up a trusted user base.  I've had my cameras for a couple of months now and could not be more happy with them.  I'm going to be stocking up these.  So will everyone else as folks catch on.  Buy one!! or two or TEN!!  You won't be disappointed.,5,1,2019-2-1,1,0,0

"Love this camera! I used it to monitor pets, keep an eye on the window we needed to replace. I even used it to time lapse watch myself clean my whole house!! I love that i can move it around if i need, and the sound and clarity are awesome. I’ve recommended this camera to all my friends.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"I highly recommend these cameras.  I've bought several for both my business and my home.  The features on this camera are great, especially for the low price.  Extremely easy to install and setup, just remember that your wifi connection needs to be 2g, they aren't compatible with 5g.  I've become a big fan on the manufacturer.  Wyze seems more like a family than a corporation, sending out monthly email newsletters and always letting you know when there are updates...",5,1,2019-1-10,1,0,0
"I loved how this was only $25. The app worked perfectly, and I've mainly used this to make super cool time-lapses. You need to have your own SD card, but that's ok. I had one lying around. The night time mode is surprisingly high quality as well. You can also very easily share the video feed with other people.",5,1,2018-12-27,1,0,0

Can’t beat this camera for the price.  I tried a few outdoor cameras with no luck. I wanted a camera to watch exactly what this camera covers.  Not too bad of a picture at night as well. Can’t use the night IR lights because of the window but the picture is still ok. I am glad I made this purchase.,5,1,2019-8-17,1,0,1
"I used this to monitor a rental property when it was closed because of covid. Did the job nicely. Impressive motion detection, even at a distance - I had it aimed out the window into the driveway. I think they will eventually hit me up for fees for online access of motion detection but so far it has been free.",5,1,2020-6-13,1,1,0
"This was recommended to us by  friend and we could not be happier. It has great easy-to-use app that is free. The set up of the camera was quick and simple.

The app comes with tons of features such as on/off infrared, custom motion detection zones and sensitivity. I highly recommend this product. You wont regret it.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"I bough this to use as a Pigeon Cam for a pigeon nest outside my apartment window, I installed it inside. VERY easy to hook up. Perfect app for viewing and tracking motion!  I even was able to hook it up to a youtube account to live stream 24/7  good night quality, definitely would purchase again!",5,1,2019-8-12,1,0,1
"I got it to record motion events to microSD without WiFi, but after pulling out the memory card to view footage, it no longer works without WiFi, I put the card back into WyzeCam, pressed Reset button on WyzeCam, everything works w/ WiFi, I set it to record Events Only and unplugged WiFi like the 1st time, but now it no longer records to microSD without WiFi. Very Frustrated and pissed off about this product, don't buy it, spend a little more to get decent quality because this WyzeCam is a piece of crap.",1,1,2019-6-17,1,0,0
"Just wow. For $25 this is a steal. The app is free, there's no continuing costs. I have the camera set up to detect motion overnight and always wake up with some notifications, usually from passing cars or lightening, but I'm very glad I've got this now. Also great for checking up on the dog!",5,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0
"I know the quality is good because a friend has one, I quickly ran home and ordered one without reading the reviews.

"I installed mine in an area that I can record the outside movement of the house and at the same time protected against the rain.

it's great when it works but often the camera will not connect.  i have a couple different cameras from different companies and the waze continually has connectivity issues and one of the cams is in the same room as the router.  i may replace these cams with one of the others that works.  Also the mic and speaker are very weak compared to my other cams.,3,1,2018-4-22,1,0,0

I have loved that this camera is so small and portable. Works great for monitoring my baby.. I have taken it on trip and it’s been perfect.

"This is the best camera, I've seen in terms of features vs cost. it can store locally 24/7 to a micro SD camera (about 3 days with a 32Gb one), web storage of event triggered clips (although would be nicer if it was longer than 15secs). Can share video feed with others. Best value camera to date.",5,1,2018-12-3,1,0,0

This camera is the best for the value def recommend to anyone.  Easy to use and great night vision.  Microphone is great and it’s awesome to be able to view it from my iPhone wherever I am.  We are using in my son right now and it’s great.  No need to buy the $200 baby monitor.,5,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0

I cant get it to work. I think its a bad designs for the set up process because in order to set up up to your phone you have to use your front facing camara to scan a QR Code but you dont get any picture of what the phone is seeing so your doing it blind. Keep in mind the QR Code is about half a inch and mine is smudged which is probably another reason that its not working. Im going to try more later (after over an hour of me and help by others to set it up) once im not so furstrated. But as of now i really do not recommend this.,1,1,2019-3-26,1,0,0
"I bought one and loved it so much, I bought a 2nd one! Very easy to set up. Video quality is great! One in my living room and one in the window. I can't wait until you make an outside version!

"Love this! Bought it as a cheaper baby monitor and it works great. You can change to movement and volume levels to when it alerts you which means his sound machine won't set it off. You can turn it so many different directions that it's easy to find a good angle, and the wire is nice and long too. I love how simple it was to install and use the app. Took me less than 10 minutes :) way better than paying double or triple for a real baby monitor.",5,1,2019-1-19,1,0,0
"For the price, this is an amazing value. Feature rich and easy set up stand out. Only problem was the power supply was no good from the get go, however since it uses a fairly universal ac/dc adapter, I am able to use any of multiple cell adapters, so no big deal. (hence, the four stars) I will buy more.",4,1,2018-12-18,1,0,0
"So this is pretty crazy, that I can buy a $24 camera with night vision, recording, motion detector and remote viewing capability. Works without a hitch. The picture quality is good, not great, but definitely acceptable. I can check my studio from anywhere in the world. Don't even hesitate. I've since bought another four for work, home and outside.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
A security camera of this quality for $25 is an insanely good deal! I plan on buying a few more for the other entrances of the house. The video quality is great and the motion detection is awesome! The app is also excellently designed so its easy and simple to use. This is an absolutely great product and 10/10 would recommend to a friend!Small Suggestion: Make a version that takes a type of battery so it is completely wireless.,5,1,2019-6-1,1,0,0
"This was really close to a 5 star for me. For the money, it's probably the best value on the market, hands down. I bought one to test it, and am planning out how many more I need for my house. The app is quick and responsive, but not flawless. The 2 way audio is a huge bonus, especially at this price range.Looking forward to an outdoor version being put out.",4,1,2018-12-12,1,0,0
I’m enjoying this camera especially at the price point. My only problem is I have it placed in front of a window and when I turn on the night vision the reflection from the camera makes the image really hard to see. At night I have to leave night vision off which it’s hard to see outside because of the darkness. I can still make out someone’s shape but I haven’t been able to figure out s resolve. Eventually I’ll probably use the camera for indoors which seems more suited! I would recommend ppl to purchase the camera.,4,1,2019-1-1,1,0,0

We finally have a low cost high quality network home camera with most of the features you would expect from solutions three times the price with monthly fees. It felt like opening an Apple product. Very nicely packaged with attention to detail with everything they start you with. Had to spend an extra $12 each on some SD cards but I’m not complaining. The app feels pretty good for a version 1.x release. I’m hoping they allow live streaming from multiple cameras at once in a future release.  I have them in the kids room on one of those next gen mesh WiFi networks. Just bought more of these  to put throughout  the house. The magnetic pop up stand is very cleaver. I would like a true PTZ feature but that may be to much to ask at this price rang.,5,1,2017-11-17,1,6,1
"Love these cameras, aside from the fact that they need to be plugged in directly to a power source. Can't beat the price...quality is great day and night, very easy setup. I have all my exits covered 24/7 with no issues.",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
So impressed with this camera! I have Arlos for outside and I bought this for an indoor camera and it is so comparable to the expensive arlos! Only thing I would say is you cannot understand if someone is talking to u through the camera I would assume it’s the low quality speaker but that doesn’t bother me because I never use that feature. Picture quality is amazing and I recommend this camera to everyone!,5,1,2019-8-14,1,0,0

I previously used an expensive camera.  So many issues with it and was never able to set up remote viewing.This was extremely simple to set up.  The clarity on the image during the day is good and I have it in SD mode.  I haven’t used it in night mode yet.  I put in a 32gig class 10 micro SD card (the largest gig size you can use).

Its worth it to get an SD card in it for the continuous recording and playback feature.  Great picture quality for the price. Setup was quick and easy and the motion detection is great.

I have it sitting in my living area just to keep an eye on everything, since I work nights and have a pet chinchilla at home it gives me ease know that he and my home are safe.

Update after using Wyze for a year now...Just go ahead and get a Ring camera. In the end they come out to nearly the same price after you buy a wyze camera $20 with the accessories +$20 all of which the Ring does in one camera for $50 and the Ring won't disappoint you as much.,5,1,2019-8-28,1,0,0
Does a wonderful job. Didn’t try out motion. Use it to keep an eye on my dog when I’m not home so it’s been working great for it. Especially since I can use the mic if he is being a little butthead.,5,1,2019-7-18,1,1,0
For the price it's an okay camera. The problem I have with it is that it says it's compatible with Alexa Show. It is sort of it does not give an announcement when it detects a motion on Alexa like Ring or Vue doorbell and there is a 10s delay with video lagging on Alexa show.,3,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
"The picture quality of Wyze is great at this price. What I hate is It make “click” sound every time when it senses different level of light. Also, it has four dots of red light in the dark environment to keep its night vision clear. And it only last for four months then the system went down! Really bothering when you are monitoring something!!!",1,1,2020-5-26,1,1,0
"I use this for my bedroom to watch my dogs and it’s absolutely perfect, the video quality is amazing, you’re able to zoom in and out, speak through and hear inside the room, I’m able to turn on motion detection to see if anyone is letting them out, the night vision looks really good, installation and guide was easy to follow and no issues with connection or connectivity.

My toddler having to transition to sleeping in her own room since she has a new baby sister was something that was nerve racking to both me and her. I decided to buy this to check on her make sure she’s okay and In bed It was super easy setting it up and I can use my app to speak to her through the camera so if I see her trying to get up and play with her toys when she’s supposed to be sleeping at 2 am I use my app and say back to bed sweetheart and she’ll climb back to bed and sleep It’s the greatest!,5,1,2019-7-13,1,0,0
"I have multiple of these cameras and may purchase more. It's everything you're looking and perhaps more. The only they can probably do more is make an outdoor camera.

I spend 95% of my time dealing with connectivity issues with this camera.No other device on my network performs this poorly.

First of all you cannot beat the price for such a great little camera. Integration with Alexa and Google works perfect. Even though this camera is listed for indoors it can be used outside with other accessories that you can find here on Amazon. I use the cameras to setup routines and keep an eye on my equipment. I would definitely recommend these cameras to anyone looking for an inexpensive camera that does what it is intended to do.,5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"Very simple to set up and use. Picture is fine for the price. Biggest problem that will prevent me from buying additional cameras is that you the recording time can’t be extended. When motion triggers the camera to record, it records for 15 seconds and no more regardless of activity. My garage camera starts recording when the door begins to open, it starts recording. By the time the door is open and someone walks in, it stops recording.",3,1,2019-9-19,1,0,0

it only captures the first few seconds of motion unless you let them milk you with their monthly subscription.

After I came back I found the cam still plugged, and it  is really hot, luckily the cam didn't burn out.  but it didn't work anymore. So the quality of the camera is doubtful.",1,1,2019-8-22,1,0,0
I was going to give this 5 stars because wow can watch my mom ( disabled) from work and make sure all is good. Just a peek here and there. Then suddenly one just stopped working. :(  The unit gets hot and so does the wall plug.,3,1,2019-7-11,1,0,0
What more can I say then we love this camera so far! This by far is the best camera I have owned for my home. The ease of use is wonderful along with the picture quality. Very clear picture during day and night. Motion detection is easy to change along with the alerts.,5,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0

Also won’t connect on the app at all...... keeps saying (sa-len-née-hee, best I could write it out.) so if they get this to me ASAP and it works as the first I will change the review.Update: 1/31 sent me replacement and it too took a few extra mins to set up but now works great!",4,1,2018-1-28,1,1,0

Great camera! My family purchased 2 of the wyze cameras to keep an eye on things while we’re out of town. I am not tech savvy and barely know how to work a computer but these were super simple to install/setup. At the most 10min per camera and that included finding the right spot to place the cameras. Only negative I would say is I don’t think the camera works when unplugged from the wall. It may work once the battery is fully charged and I just don’t know it yet but overall great cameras for an even greater price.,5,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0

"This camera does almost everything I was hoping for.  The picture quality is good for the price paid and the build is consistent with the price-point. Daytime use is great. At night though, I was hoping I could use it to monitor my yard from inside the house. The night vision lights, however, are reflected by the window making the video useless. If I had read more reviews, I would have known this. I probably would have purchased it anyway because it's such a good value.",4,1,2018-1-1,1,1,0

"I really wanted tomkike this product. Unfortunately, it has not lived up to my expectations. It was initially difficult to connect to the internet. When I finally got it connected I found I really needed a micro SD card to record. Even with the card inserted it doesn't record. I played back the last 12 hours during which time I came and went several times and it never shows this. Perhaps I have nit set something correctly. This would be possible because the instructions are non existent. I'm fairly tech literate but have given up and am returning this product.",1,1,2019-4-27,1,0,0

"Initially skeptical due to the low cost of these cameras, the reviews I read were positive, so I decided to give it a try. TOTALLY IMPRESSED!  Set up was very easy.

One of the best values on wireless cameras. I had my reservations about the quality and reliabilty since it was so affordable but since getting my first one I have since ordered 3 more. The Pan and tilt camera is really good with its tracking system. It will lock in on a moving target and follow it around the room recording every movement.

Purchased for a simple security camera for my home.  For the price you won't beat it!  Easy set-up and with two-way audio it makes communicating with my kids even easier.  Plan to add the motion sensors and Wyze Bulbs too.,5,1,2019-6-17,1,0,0
"I tried this camera out because the other cameras that I have are garbage. This by far, blows the other cameras I’ve had, out of the water. The picture quality is amazing in both regular and night vision. It was extremely easy to set up. And one of the best things about it is the app. It’s user friendly, and easy to navigate through. I’m definitely going to purchase a few more for the rest of my house to replace the ones I have by another company.",5,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0

My Arlo was a bit disappointing as i can see a few seconds of delay everytime the apps starts up eventhough there's good wifi connections.

If your looking for 4k video this ain't it but if you just want to see what's happening around your home it will work just fine. In my opinion you get more than you pay for with decent motion detection and sound activation. Easy to setup.,4,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0

"Perfect! Using as a baby monitor paired with a fire tablet 7, all for less than $100. Camera has continuous live stream perfect for a baby monitor. I tried the Ring indoor cam before I bought the Wyze Cam and never it connected properly. It also does not have continuous live stream, only 10 min of live stream so it would not work for what I needed. The Wyze Cam was less than half the price and does everything the other cams do.",5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0

These cameras are amazing. I supplement my “closed” Reolink system with these. The two systems are not compatible but I place the cheep Wyze cameras in public areas.. like my child’s bus stop. Hopefully they will make them Onif compatable someday. I don’t particularly like “broadcasting” video via internet. I use an android tv box and “tinycam” to display cameras.,5,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
"I have one for my backyard and another in the house to keep an eye on my cats throughout the day and absolutely LOVE them. The picture quality is phenomenal and the 14 day cloud recording is a good bonus (12 second motion clips store for up to 2 week). My only issue is that the cameras can't yet differentiate between human/actual motion and things like a leaf blowing, or snow falling, so a bug can fart and it sets off the motion detection.",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0

"We loved this at first - easy set up, great quality video. Then, after just a couple of months, it suddenly stopped connecting. We tried fixing it ourselves, no dice, and then contacted customer service, who has been comically unhelpful. First they gave us a laundry list of trouble-shooting to do's before they'd even consider our claim, and then, when none of those steps worked, they just stop responding to our emails. At this point we may as well just throw the camera is in the trash. I guess it's really true that you get what you pay for.",1,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0
This camera is awesome for the money. The 12 second clips that record to the cloud are nice but the sd card recording is what is so great about this camera. You can have it record continuously and review a moment in time or have it just record on motion events which can save months worth of footage on a 32 gb card.  Awesome quality.,5,1,2018-5-4,1,1,0

I love this little camera. I have several of them installed in my house and they work great! Easy to setup! I have one at my front door and another at my back door and they alert me whenever anyone comes near and records it too. Love it!,5,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"This thing is pretty amazing! Congrats to the dev team!  the app is SO easy to use, the camera has a great wide shot best to put in corner to see whole room, very easy to setup, not sure about the night vision yet because I just got it and couldnt wait to review!

This camera works great especially for the price. We had issues getting it to send us notifications at first but we got it to work! Image is super clear during the day but is hard to see without light at night. With a light the night vision works great.,5,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
"At the beginning this camera worked so well. So I decided to buy an additional 5 cameras. What a deceptive purchase. After running them for 3 weeks, one by one they started failing. From connection issues (using the fastest speeds from Verizon) to SD cards burn out. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.... I've learned my lesson the hard way.",1,1,2018-5-31,1,0,0

"Camera arrived today and setup was extremely easy! I’m honestly surprised at the video quality - especially because it’s 1080p for about $25! We’re using this camera as a petcam, so we’re not too picky; just needed something to check up on our dog throughout the day while we’re both away at work.The speaker, playback, and picture settings work well. No complaints so far! Will update once we’ve used this for a while.",5,1,2019-8-27,1,0,1

"Way better than the wyze Pam pan, we wanted to upgrade but looked like we will probably be coming back to these little cameras as night time vision seems way better, doesn’t move but is easily hidden and looks better as is smaller in size, does what is intended. Night vision is ok, not clear but can see movement and can easily detect person or animal in the room. Handy to check up on family members and can communicate with them which isn’t clear But gets there attention.",4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0

Great product. Consistently sends alerts for motion and sound in the house. I use to check in on pets and security around the house. Wyze provides excellent customer support and keeps in touch with their customers as well. Extremely easy to set up. The app is intuitive and easy to use as well. Purchased 3 of these and will be buying some of the 360 Cameras for more coverage. Highly recommend.,5,1,2019-3-17,1,0,0

"It's almost perfect. Everything in this camera is good except for one important thing which is delay in notifying; if the cam detects someone or a motion, I get the alarm or the notification 1 minute later on my phone although I have a 50mp internet and I tried this on 2 devices, so they need to fix this coz it's very important to everyone using it.",4,1,2019-7-28,1,1,0
I bought one to see how good it was ! I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and ease to set up. I put one camera at my mom’s house to check on her during the day and was completely satisfied with the results. I could check to see my mother was awake and had taken her medicine for the day and was in good spirits for the day and found that my anxiety level went down by seeing her healthy and happy going about her day.

"Good inexpensive basic camera. Picture quality is good, but not very feature rich, smart home-wise. Storage is free 14 days from recording via Amazon cloud, which is nice. Camera feed is reachable only trough their iOS or Android app, but No Alexa or smart integration at this time, so you can't set it to record when you leave or have IFTTT integration. I think that's one of the only drawbacks I can see.",4,1,2019-7-8,1,0,0

I would get this product again for live surveillance but it doesn't work well for person detection on my front porch. It worked occasionally when I first got it and then nothing. My numerous emails to tech support weren't helpful. I was hoping for a less expensive (mostly the cost of installation) Ring but it hasn't worked out.,3,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
Great product for the price.  Can't  beat the quality or convenience for the prices.  I wish they would hurry up and make outdoor versions.  These are great to use on their own or to supplement an existing system.  I put one in my garage to keep an eye on things when working outside with the doors open,5,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"Unreliable. We bought this camera for our baby’s room but it disconnects multiple times per day/night. In order to restore the connection I have to go in her room and risk waking her up to unplug the camera and plug it back in. The price is great and the camera is great when it’s working, but unfortunately that isn’t very often.

This little guy works great for what I need it for. I had some trouble connecting it to my WiFi but ended up being my fault cuz I entered my password wrong. The camera can only connect to 2.4G. It can’t connect to 5G. The camera is pretty clear and love the magnetic base.,5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0

The price of course. I have this camera on a enclosed porch. It has never missed a beat and has all the features. The image is crystal clear and has decent color.

Over all pretty worthless. Will only record for a few seconds. There is no way to change this unless you subscribe to a way over priced service.

For the price you will not find a better value. Stream quality and ease of use are pretty good. The one down side is that you have to use the wyze service. Though it's free it has gone down a few times leaving the cameras dead and unuseable.,5,1,2019-1-18,1,0,0

The ability to record 24/7 on MicroSD paired with Free Cloud BackUp of recording clips ( for quite a few days, maybe 7) from when it captures motion or hears sound, not to mention the low cost, is outstanding.

Honestly amazing for $25. Took me 5 minutes to hook up after I downloaded the app. I also bought a 32G SD card on amazon for $5 so I can re wind a couple of days of live fee. I think the SD card is a must. The voice is delayed a few seconds but it’s fine. This camera simply plugs into any outlet and hooks up to WiFi. So far so good.

Worked great for about 6 weeks and then noticable degraded camera quality crept in. Now at about 2 months the live and recorded video is pixelated and unusable.

I was eyeing for the yi cam but when I saw this cam I've waited for a month until it becomes available again and a few weeks more before it arrived. For $25, it really is too good to be true. The video is clear only when nothing is moving. It's blurry when the subject is moving which makes it useless. The alert detection is a hit and miss. Sometimes it will send you an alert, sometimes not. And if ever it did, the video is about several seconds delayed like the subject was almost already out of the frame before it starts recording. Tried all 3 motion detection sensitivity nothing works perfectly. The firmware is updated to the latest version. Also remote access is very hard to connect. I'm glad I bought only one to try it first.",1,1,2018-2-21,1,4,0

When the night vision kicked on the reflection of the camera is the only thing that was visible. I know others have had better luck through a window at night. This isn't a deal killer for us since he only put it in the window to test it out. He plans on putting in the basement, so that won't be an issue.The app is easy enough to use and setup was simple and straight forward. Setting the motion tracking area takes some tweaking.

Absolutely recommend this to everyone.,5,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0

The microphone projects louder than expected (which can be a benefit). Definitely get a memory card/chip with it. It's worth it!,5,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0
I initially started the return process because my Wi-Fi signal wasn't strong enough.  I bought an extender and it works great now.  Much better than the one that cost 5 times as much.Will be buying more.,5,1,2019-4-22,1,0,0
This little camera has some of the best picture and sound qualities you could ask for without actually being there. I use it as a monitor to check on  my Grandfather while I’m at work and he’s at home with the care taker.,5,1,2020-1-11,1,1,0
"Great camera, easy to set up, and an incredible picture. Not much or I can say here that others have not already said. Highly recommended.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"This is the best product for this purpose. It connected easily to my wifi. The app is excellent and it detects sound and motion perfectly. About the app recording without permission, well I have to say that theres a on and off button on the app so use it and stop complaining if you dont know how to use tech.",5,1,2019-4-4,1,0,1
This camera has all the bells and whistles. I cant believe everything this camera can do for the price. The App is incredibly easy to setup and use. This even has free cloud storage and is compatible with Alexa.,5,1,2019-5-9,1,0,0
Love the quality of the day and night picture!!! So clear!! We use it with our echo show and it’s great!! Just make sure you have the latest upgrade on the software for the camera in order for it to connect to Alexa properly!,5,1,2019-2-2,1,0,0
"I like this camera a lot. It gives me peace of mind while I’m at work. I love that I can talk through it and zoom in. The picture quality isn’t the greatest when you zoom, but overall it’s awesome for the price. Thank you!",5,1,2019-9-8,1,0,0
"Smart camera? Pretty dumb actually. You have to flash the firmware, which you cant do from the usb and buy an extra USB male to USB male to get it to work. The micro usb is only for power. What a joke.",1,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
I’ve never had cameras in my house before so having any camera was pretty awesome and for the value with these cameras the picture quality is great even at night,4,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0
"Great product, I just wish they would make a mount that you could put a bunch of batteries in that you could plug into the wire port in the back so you could mount the camera high on a wall with no wire. It seems like a security issue to be able to disconnect the camera just by yanking on the wire. It's strange that there isn't already a solution for this. That's my only problem with it, I would buy ten more if there was a battery powered option. Until then I will just have one. No other area I would like a camera is anywhere remotely close to a power outlet.",4,1,2019-1-1,1,0,0
"For the price, you just can't go wrong with this. Setup is easy, picture is amazing app features are great. This has got to get some sort of ""product of the year"" type of award.If you're thinking about getting one, DO IT!!",5,1,2018-12-19,1,0,0
"This is the first wifi camera that I've been impressed it, the nice features include: SD Cart slot, easy to set up with the app, and nice views.",5,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
Love this little thing! I bought this to replace my the camera in my sons room. This one was soooo easy to setup. I did have to restart my router but after that I had no problems at all.,5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
The night vision needs a little work in the early morning hours (2am-7am) can’t see anything in the dark. But other then that love it.,5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
Amazing camera at such a low price. 14 days free online storage is a huge bonus.You would be a fool not to have at least 1.,5,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0
Love these cameras. Very affordable and does exactly what my more expensive camera does. I currently am using six of these cameras. Can you view the cameras through my phone or tablet with a great quality and play back.,5,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0

The perfect innovation for everyone. This camera very professionally looking and give you excellent picture and sound quality. It was seameanly just too easy to get it up and running. A great buy for your money.,5,1,2019-2-18,1,0,0
For $25 you can't beat it. This camera is awesome. I have zero complaints. Would recommend and plan on getting more for garage area and front and back of house. The night vision is great and super clear. The motion detection is almost 100% accurate. There are some instances where it will detect light coming on as motion and record that light and not catch the actual motion. Otherwise 5 out of 5.,5,1,2019-6-29,1,0,0
"For the price this cam is perfect. It’s easy to set up, the picture quality is decent and the motion sensor is great. The only thing I wish was different is that when you speak through the app to whomever is on the other end of the camera, the voice was also recorded. Other than that I love it. Will be ordering 2 more.",4,1,2019-8-31,1,0,0

We use to keep an eye on our young daughters.  These are extremely easy to setup and have great display.  No cost for cloud unless you actually want to keep recordings.  For checking up on things this works great.  Cheap and easy.,5,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
For the price this is the best out there. I am shocked how clear everything is also the wide range of the camera is perfect. I bought the SD card with it which I also highly recommend for anyone considering purchasing this camera.,5,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"I have not tried this camera without the SD card but I know with it, it works great and does exactly what I need it to. Picture quality is absolutely amazing. Great product overall for a decent price.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"Hello, I bought this item months ago and I thought I had returned it, but I found it and it has yet to connect and I can no longer return the item. So I spent good money on a product that doesn't work.",1,1,2019-4-28,1,0,0
This is an incredible camera for the money!!  I’m now using 3 V2’s and 2 Pan cameras from Wyze. I’m very very happy this the camera and there are more coming my way in the future for sure!,5,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
