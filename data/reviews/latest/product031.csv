"A lot of people use copier paper in their ink jet printer and then wonder why their printer jams and breaks down early. I have learned the hard way that to get grief-free, long-life from my ink-jet printers, it is best to use ink-jet paper. The higher quality results are noticable, there is less dust given off that collects in the mechanism of the printer, and the printer lasts longer.But more importantly, when I hand someone a document that I printed on this paper, it is not unusual to hear ""Oh, you use good paper."" That makes me feel good.",5,1,2018-5-12,1,1,0
"This is a very reasonably priced general-purpose white printer paper.  It is 'ultra white,"" and the paper works extremely well with especially HP printers, but probably any printers in terms of clean and accurate feeds and precision results.  Print quality is very crisp and clean; even photographs reproduce well on this paper.  The price is excellent for this level of quality, and a paper of this type should always be used with better inkjet or laser printers made by HP and other manufacturers.",5,1,2018-10-24,1,8,1
"This is a great product. Bright white, nice weight.  My suggestion:  do not order it with other items.  When I did do so (twice), the shipping box was not sufficiently packaged to prevent damage from the heavy ream of paper to other items in the box, nor to itself, as it apparently flew around the inside of the shipping box during the shipping process.  If you want the product, and hope for a positive outcome, my suggestion: order it solo.  I won't order it from Amazon with other items again.  As an aside, Amazon was great with providing me a refund.",5,1,2018-10-18,1,7,0
"CAUTION""  I received two broken & open on two paper package sides""""""  one package had slight bent corners when I today just opened for use and one paper package was sealed in a re-wrapped plastic bag thus knowing shipping broken loose package.  This is the one with 1/2 bent folds in one corner at least 200 sheets. MY ISSUE IS THAT I NEED IT TODAY AND NOW.... SO I WILL KEEP.  See pictures of what was in sealed box just opened today.",2,1,2018-2-27,1,5,1
"The product came messed up, the box used for shipping was WAY to big, not enough packing to hold it in place and got shaken, as it was for a specific project with a timeline, I used what i could, the rest got trashed, not usable.. The product was as expected, that of it that survived. It works and the print is good. The paper is fine, but I will buy locally next time.",3,1,2018-1-18,1,5,0
"I thought this paper would be at least servicable judged on reviews, however it is very thin and lackluster.  I am a real estate broker and need to print reports for my customers and this paper produces reports that are poor quality, with ink bleeding through to the back and edges that curl up.  It's just plain flimsy.  It's actually the worst paper I have ever worked with, and I certainly expected better from the HP brand!  I'm assuming this paper was made decently in the past, however what they are now delivering must have suffered a severe drop in quality.",2,1,2020-5-15,1,2,0
"This is by far the worst printer paper I've ever used. It absolutely will not print in my Epson NX420 without jamming. I'm throwing away the ream of paper rather than risk breaking my printer with paper jam after paper jam. When I try printing with a sheet from another brand, I have no problem at all. As soon as I try using this again, I'm back to constant jamming. This was a lesson learned the hard way.",1,1,2019-10-9,1,1,0
It came in a box and was protected well throughout the transition. It arrived before 8pm. I am happy I have paper now loaded into my printer. Now I don't have to worry! The paper quality is good and I can definitely tell it is really white. When it prints the ink doesn't bleed onto the back of the printing paper. I think this paper handles it well.,5,1,2017-9-14,1,2,0
"I have found that this paper is the most consistent for every-day inkjet printer usage on the two HP ENVY Photo units in the household.  It is used mostly for black-and-white and pages such as emails and with highlight colors like the grocery shopping list from the grocery web site.  It works well with images from screen captures and on-line sites, even white on saturated black backgrounds when I can't avoid them.  I rarely need to switch to photo quality paper and high-quality print settings.Although HP provides on-line ordering, I have found order-management and fulfillment by Amazon Prime to be easier and also a cost-benefit, along with elimination of inessential travel.  This July 20, 2020 order was a re-order of a 2018-11-23 order of the same product.  There is no problem keeping a supply for such an extended time, consuming on ream at a time.",5,1,2020-9-1,1,2,0
Its paper. ... Came with the wrap all torn up but the paper was not crinkled up or folded so üëç Will be buying more in the future. Costs the same as what I could get at office depot but it's a little higher quality so that's good. And I don't have to deal with sh*tty office depot workers who act like it's their business what I do and what I need whatever I'm buying for. ü§î Ridiculous people who act like they are better than you and you the customer answer to them. Really weird. I'm so put off by brick n mortar shopping. Amazon is the best. üëçI will add though my printer stopped loading paper correctly and it kept jamming so I had to buy a new printer. Coincidence? ü§î The new printer had no problems loading this paper. ... You decide.,5,1,2019-11-26,1,3,0
"Where do I even begin? Before my purchase of this paper I was lost. I was swimming in a world of sub-par paper. Flyers, assignments, bills, essays: all written on paper that was not up to par.Then I saw this case.",5,1,2020-5-30,1,3,0
"I got this paper to print an important document that needed to be three hole punched, but half the three holes didn't line up even when the tops of the paper did. It kept getting jammed in my printer. So what I ended up doing was using my normal paper and three hole punching it, as the ""prepunched"" three holes looked unkempt and would break as soon you put them in a binder.  Only one out three copies I printed the holes lined up properly. Needless to say I will be using my usual paper and three hole punching it myself so it looks more professional.",1,1,2019-4-19,1,5,0
"I can't fault the product.  It is fine.  Unfortunately, don't try to buy only one.  The product was shipped in one of those flimsy plastic mail envelopes.  I doubt it even got outside of the gates before the paper wrapping around the ream split open.  Let's face it, everything get jostled around during shipping, so expecting something to not get tossed is not realistic.  In the end, I had a package full of bent, dinged, ripped and unacceptable paper.  I was able to salvage a surprisingly large amount, but 1/4 to 1/3 was still just not usable.  It should have been shipped in a box.",5,1,2020-7-11,1,1,0
"What more do you want to know? Square, white, blank... you know... how paper usually should be. But, it's cheaper than the other brands on amazon, came in a timely manner, and crinkle free! So sure, buy it! Buy this paper! Don't think about it. Just buy it! So far, it's cruelty free. Hasn't cut me yet, but I'll update my review if anything changes after more use...",5,1,2020-3-12,1,2,0
When I removed the typing paper from the box the package was torn into.  Clearly a return product because you can tell it was cut across the top and down the side. Paper was falling out.  No idea if I have the correct amount of sheets.  I realize this is just paper but very disappointed there is no quality check before shipping.,1,1,2020-2-9,1,3,0
"When it arrives, the package broke and some of the paper got damaged a little bit. The paper inside is kind of as expected, but I think I should have used another brand or type of paper.About this paper: Thin, somehow transparent, white but not with too much brightness. It has everything that the paper needs to be, but just doesn't make me too happy after I printed things out by my Epson Ecotank ET series printer.",3,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"I bought this in Feb, to keep my paper inventory stocked. I just had to print the same thing over 5 times and each time it came out of printer s mudged. This is not happening with the paper I had before, so it has to be the paper quality. It does not adhere!  I have to do letters to professionals and it is completely frustrating that now I am literally out of paper because I cannot use this whole ream. And I can't return it because it was bought in Feb and wrapping is tossed. Don't buy this...don't risk it!",1,1,2020-5-20,1,1,0
"I was running out of paper so ordered a package with other essential items to consolidate shipments.  Have not used it as yet so cannot rate brightness, quality or value.  Until state governments completely lift corona virus restrictions  it is best to limit purchases to just essential items.  Feeling sad today when I was checking Jeff Bezos CEO of Amazon and owner of Washington Post bias.  All other google search results had positive headlines regarding Dexamethasone a steroid that reduces COVID-19 deaths... Then there was Washington Post with the headline ""Live updates: FDA yanks emergency authorization for drug touted by Trump as covid-19 treatment""  Think I will switch online shopping to Walmart and Target to protest of Washington Post bias!!!!",3,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"For the price I paid I'm amazed at how much paper I got, WAY more than I would have got in-store somewhere. I'm pretty sure I'm going to be good on printer paper for a year or more. The print quality is nice, paper itself is extremely clean and blank.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"No one could have prepared me for the awe-inspiring grace that this ream of paper brought to my house.

This paper out performs other paper by a ratio of 1 to 1. Paper is compatible with ink and graphite/lead pencil. Paper makes decent paper airplanes. One can even read things from the paper after writing and printing modifications to the paper‚Äôs very classy complete eggshell white design. The invisible pattern works great I can‚Äôt even see it. Can roll phatty boom batty check and Chong class spliffs. Paper may be used to mail information thoughts pictures coloring and stickers to other people.

"The paper is slightly thinner than your good quality printer paper, kinda transparent... but I‚Äôm not going to give it a horrible review because the price for the amount was good and I can still use it for printing and other purposes.

Paper quality is good. It prints up nicely in my HP desktop printer. No streaking or smearing after printing. We ordered two of these so we'd have a back up. Great price too....cheaper then target! Will re-order when we run out again.,5,1,2017-9-23,1,3,0
"I was nearly out of paper, so I ordered this out of all of the choice because the price is's reasonable and for a good brand, HP Office 2020. I'm happy with my purchase and will likely order again as needed. I recommend this seller and seller's product.",5,1,2020-3-24,1,0,0

"I used to buy this in store but the price went up and then it disappeared. I had to switch to a basic brand at Best Buy which was comparable. All of my paper is for filing legal pleadings and there's been no complaints. You don't want it to be too bright because it'll really strain your eyes trying to read all the text. There's not a lot to say about paper. Remember, when it comes to pleadings, weight is enforced by court rules which is something to keep in mind.",5,1,2017-6-11,1,2,0
"Actually the printer paper deserves 5 stars , but how the product looks after shipping and when the package is opened , sorry ,only 1 star because that is what a printer paper deserves which has bent edges and can't be used .It still can be used to light up the grill , a smoker or a campfire , so don't worry too much . I knew that it is a gamble , but I won't buy in the future definitely not by mail .",1,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0
What can I say?  It is good paper.  I am most happy that I did not have to go to an office supply store or Walmart just for a ream of paper.  It was so nice to just order a quality ream of paper and have it on my doorstep so quickly.  Thank you,5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"this paper jams easily in my hp printer. It is kept flat in a cabinet and I like in a very low humidity environment.When it doesn't jam, I  do like the way even graphics look on the paper. The brighter white makes everything pop on the page.",3,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0

I should write a review!""This is plain old paper- nothing fancy or sleek- but it is all you need in this day and age.  If you want high quality paper, it is usually to take a resume to an interview or job fair or because you have a sales proposal or something else to provide a customer.  The rest of what we print is usually just for editing ""off screen"" before we submit something electronically. For this type of printing the paper (and the VALUE) cannot be beat.",5,1,2012-1-6,1,0,0

"Well, it's paper. Lol.  Nothing for me to carry on about or criticize really.  Good price and good paper.

This works equally well in my BIJ 2600 and CLP 5550 printers.  Standardizing on tray 2 as 11x17 and tray 1 as 8.5x11 helps with the new (7-2010) win7 printer driver.",5,1,2010-7-22,1,5,0
"This paper is a little thinner and ""toothier"" than the heavier, smoother 24-pound Xerox paper I usually buy, which could explain why it jammed in my laser printer. It was a real bear getting it unwrapped from around the paper rollers and free up the printer so I could finish printing! :\ However, it is a nice bright white color and the laser printer toner-ink seems to adhere to its surface just fine.

"I have nothing bad to say about the paper.  HP paper is an excellent paper for general printing and copying using an ink jet printer.  The issue we had was with the delivery.  Not sure who did the handling but by the time the box arrived it was ""bent"" and several of the paper reams were torn open.  Fortunately the paper itself was not damaged (surprised by that).  I think the damage was due to the HP box being bound in a plastic strip that was used to carry the box from place to place.  Absolutely no ""care"" was taken to handle the package.",3,1,2020-5-10,1,0,0
"I was so excited to use this because I have an HP printer. I was a little disappointed when I started using it. First impression was it is a little bit thin than what I expected. I was looking for quality paper to print all my notes and projects for school. The ink on it is alright, you can read it clearly. I am not sure if thats my HP printer that does that. What I hate the most, is that it jams my printer. Some paper gets stuck and sometimes when I print, i get a double paper- you know when one blank paper sticks with the one printing. overall, i mean it does its job but i didnt expect these little circumstances for a high end brand paper.pros - its the cheapest one available.",3,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
This can be a difficult size of paper to find.  I was having to go to local office stores to buy it.  I started buying it on Amazon and have been very happy.  It is cheaper than the office stores and the quality of the paper is good.  The ink shows up well and the brightness of the paper is just right.,5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
This paper was changed my life. I don‚Äôt know what I would have done without the paper. I have never had paper before that was as good as this paper. It was just so papery and the perfect size. I could write on it or print on it. I could fold it and use of it for origami or paper airplanes. I could color pictures on it. I could cut it up in strips. It is simply perfect!,5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
I searched in the market for the balance between quality and price and couldn't find better than this deal.

The box arrived in a sturdy Official HP Box.  While the box was a bit worn upon arrival, the paper arrived in great usable shape.The first few top sheets were a little bent on one corner, but not badly and it really looks like they'll be okay once run through the printer (still have some old paper I'm using up, so will post my printing experiences with it later).",5,1,2011-7-7,1,1,0

Turns out that shipping 26 lbs of paper in a thin cardboard box is somewhat problamatic. Ours arrived with the top busted off and the box taped back together by the shipping company. I assume this happened because the box was being handled individually and tossed from station to station by the shipping personnel and equipment. 26lbs of paper has a lot of momentum and that is a pretty thin cardboard box. So the top split open and spilled the contents. That box was meant to be shipped on a pallet not individually.  The top 10-15% of paper was all dishuffled and wrinkled. We kept the box as I didn't want to hassle with returning it but I think I'll go back to picking up a case at the local Office[Depot/Max].The cost is about the same and I will get the paper intact.,2,1,2009-1-8,1,5,0

"For the price, this is good quality paper for day to day printing. The box has easy side-access that is very convenient and well-designed. I like that I don't have to keep opening up paper-wrapped reams. What you have to watch is the delivery. I have ordered this box a number of times, and sometimes the delivery service has been less than kind to the box. Admittedly, it is a heavy item. But that doesn't mean they can toss the box around. My advice -- When the box arrives, give it a quick visual inspection. Particularly for dents and cuts in the box. Make sure they don't damage the paper inside. The paper is what I expected and is the same as what you would get in any store that sell's HP Paper of this thickness and brightness. I use this thickness of paper heavily and for just about everything except resumes. I've bought paper of this thickness and brightness before for drafts of artwork. Business letter's are fine with this too unless you are planning to use some kind of stamp embossing. This is such a smart idea. It gives me just as much paper without the bulk. I like this paper but the packaging was really bad. Read all the bad reviews for this product because most of them are true. For how much money I spent on this, I expected better.... I'm still giving this 5 stars because most of the paper is still good.",5,1,2016-2-17,1,1,0

Hp loves to overprice even the plain old paper and it's just not worth it. The only reason I tried this paper is to see if it would make my ink last longer. I was thinking the exact same off brand of paper was absorbing more ink than the hp brand would but even on the draft setting in quality on the printer settings. It didn't make a difference in ink useage.,3,1,2015-11-9,1,4,0

I've ordered hundreds of items from Amazon over the years and have come to depend on their packaging to protect my items -- I've been very satisfied until I ordered this HP Office paper Quickpack. They just slapped a label and an invoice on the book and shipped it.

"I ordered paper for our company, using all HP Printers; from a Laserjet P2015d to a OfficeJet Pro 8500 and a few in between. I print 150 pages first thing every morning and the first thing I noticed was my Laserjet started acting strange. I kept getting an error light coming up and would have to restart the printer, it would print 2 pages, and the same error. 150 pages now takes about 20 minutes to print! Very annoying! Well after looking up the error online I found it was the error that was saying the printer was having a hard time getting paper! WHY? HP Paper + HP Printer should be no problem I would think. Anyway so I almost bought another printer, called up the admin to ask about getting one and was told they were having problems too, with the paper I had recently given them. Turns out I had given a ream of paper to them because I had one extra ream laying around! He said their printers (same as mine) kept getting errors and would pick up 2 sheets at times also. He suggested I try different paper in the printer before getting a new printer!Not sure exactly why the paper does this but I am never buying this paper again except maybe to use in the bathroom!",1,0,2012-4-1,1,0,0

Not have to grab random handfuls and HOPE it's 500, not, say 487 or 525.

The carton is now shipping nested in a larger, thicker brown cardboard box, so shipping problems described by other reviewers are a thing of the past (at least those caused by shipping the paper without proper protection).

Definitely value for money. Brightness of 92 but still pretty bright. Paper quality is good. Not so very high grade but great for general prints.

Given our current work from home situation, I really need to this page today and can't afford to return and wait another 2 business days for a replacement.I just don't understand why someone would need blank paper so desperately?",2,1,2020-3-19,0,1,1

"I bought this particular package of paper because it is the cheapest one you can get that isn't an add-on item. It works fine, but better deals are available, especially if you buy a box of reams instead of a single ream like I did, but I just don't need that much printer paper.",4,1,2019-7-1,0,6,0
The paper is fine but my package look like it was used or some one had opened it before. One end was open when it arrived and had a sticker on it trying to hold it closed that did not seem to be original to the packaging.It seems some other reviewers had this same issue. It looks like amazon might be selling returned paper without closely inspecting it.,2,1,2019-8-23,0,5,0
Seriously Amazon??? Crunched up and opened is not how one expects to receive an $18 package of paper. Not impressed.,1,1,2020-6-25,0,5,1
"This paper is nice. Very white and great for print or making notes. It is thin enough to not to make my printer jam, but also it is thick enough to enable me print both sides. The only issue, which was my mistake, is its length. Unfortunately I had not noticed it is not A4/letter size which is what my printer accepts. But I might buy more of these in the in the future, albeit the right size!",5,1,2017-12-27,0,7,0
"I ordered 2 packages of this 3-hole paper. In both packages, about 1 page in 5 had holes that did not align with the other pages. Having to flip through 1000 pages of blank paper to manually remove about 200 pages that are defective is not my idea of fun, efficient, or cost effective.",1,1,2018-9-20,0,9,1
"The quality of this paper is excellent and I would recommend using it for things like printing resumes but for everyday use (especially when printing drafts and information documents), the quality and thickness is wasted. That wouldn't be so bad if the paper was not at the price point it currently is. I am used to buying draft/multi-purpose printing paper at the $4-6 price range so I found this paper too expensive for what I needed it for.  I am not suggesting that this paper was not worth the cost paid--it was a good price, all things considered.I would purchase this product again should I need it for quality print jobs. During Covid, I was especially thankful that I could get this item delivered.",4,1,2020-9-11,0,0,0

In compare to market other photocopy paper it is so cheaper. But the paper is too thiner. While you print double side. You can see words feom back side is visible because of thinness of paper. Which makes little bit bad.,3,1,2020-10-6,0,0,0
