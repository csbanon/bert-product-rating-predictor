"The earbuds worked seamlessly and well out of the box.  I use them while hiking the hills with my dogs and when working at my desk - I can still hear outside noises when needed for safety, but can listen to music without disturbing others.  The earbuds are comfortable even during exercise, and they fit securely.Using the earbuds as a headset with my cell phone is easy as well.  I do have to experiment with how they handle the Google assistant.",5,1,2018-12-17,1,2,0
Excelentes Audífonos.  Se cargan fácilmente con el estuche de los mismos y este se carga inhalambricamente.  Adiós cables!!  Se enciende automáticamente y se conectan al teléfono de inmediato con solo sacarlos del estuche.Se escucha perfecto y me escuchan excelente al conversar por teléfono.  Totalmente recomendados!,5,1,2019-3-16,1,2,1
"Edit: these will not stay connected to each other.These headphones felt more expensive than they are. The volume is great. It would be better if double click skipped to the next song. They work great if you stay inside and sit still on the couch, unmoving. The minute I step outside with these, they constantly drop connection with each other and cut in and out. These headphones seem to work perfectly with my Chromebook but kinda wonky with my iphone. They are good for $30-40 headphones if you sit still in your house.",1,1,2019-2-20,1,2,0
"I bought these based on the reviews. The reviews were awesome. But, I really felt like the reviews were too good to be true. So I figured for $30 what would I really be losing if they didn't work out. I have say the positive reviews are right on the money. These earbuds come with several sets of earpieces to ensure you get the proper fit. They are small and discrete and tuck nicely into the ear and they stay in while running and working out and sweating. I use them not only to listen to music and watch Netflix on my phone but also for hands free talking in my car and they work great.  The charging carrier has a built in charger bank that keeps the earbuds charged after being unplugged from a power source.  I bought mine on a Prime lightning deal and got them even cheaper than the regular price. Talk about a bargain. So they get 5 stars. A definite buy for anyone looking for awesome, wireless earbuds on the cheap. I have had mine since Christmas and they are working great.",5,1,2019-4-17,1,2,1
"I'd give these ""TOZO T10"" earbuds 4.7 stars if I could.(I didn't get paid for this review, and I didn't get the earbuds for free.)",5,1,2019-4-27,1,2,0
"These are good for around the office and in the kitchen... I have smaller ears and they fit fine with the smallest tips. When properly in, the sound quality is great. When walking however, these cut in and out... sometimes just the left... sometimes both.... giving a chopping distraction that is annoying. So if you are working out in the gym or in a generally stationary environment, these are great... but if you are going to be walking/jogging.... the choppy in and out can be a serious downside. **update** choppy connections seem to be getting worse - returning for refund. :-(**addition update** customer service reached out offering to send another product, apparently I may have received just a defective product. Super excited and hopeful that that's the case. Either way, awesome customer service. Will update again. ::fingers crossed::",2,1,2019-2-14,1,2,0
"I have had my earbuds for about 4 months now. I am a highly technical person, and I love music, but do not think I would classify myself as an audiophile. I now have 3 different sets of TWS earbuds, and out of the 3, these are my favorites. One thing I did that makes a difference, at least for me, is I replaced the included tips with memory foam ones that I have used on a number of different earbuds over the past few years.Pros:",5,1,2019-5-9,1,2,0
EDIT: pleased with customer service! They reached out and offered to send us another complementary set of earbuds. We were pleasantly surprised to receive a new set and they worked perfectly!!!! Yay! Thank you Tozo for going above and beyond to make this right :)————,5,1,2019-4-16,1,2,0
"I'm one of the very, very few people who cannot use the apple air pods. No matter how hard I try, they fall out of my ear in less than a minute. I thought I would try a different brand, and when I put these in my ear, they fell out within seconds. I was about to give up, pack up the box, and send it back, but I decided to check out the instruction manual in case i was doing something wrong. I’m so happy I did. Turns out there were 4 sizes of plastic ear caps included with the earbuds. On my third try, the second smallest ones, I felt how i imagine Cinderella felt when she tried on the glass slipper. They were perfect and no matter how much I jumped up and down or shook my head, they stayed in place!The quality of sound is impeccable, nice highs and lows, with a decent amount of bass. Once I found the right match, the fit was extremely comfortable.",4,1,2018-12-14,1,6,1
"The sound quality of the TOZO T10 TWS Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds is the best I have ever experienced and because of the tightly fit of the ear caps, the outside noises are mostly reduced into muffled sound which makes the music coming out of the earpieces crystal clear and seemingly coming from all directions. This pair of masterpiece also boasts of its deep bass which makes you feel more like in a theater enjoying live band!The most crucial thing is to choose the right size ear caps that fit your just right. Fortunately, TOZO T10 TWS Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds come with four sets of ear caps making the fitting easier and more precise.",5,1,2019-4-8,1,1,1
"While this doesn't touch the $300+ Jabras for sound quality and range, these are really amazing. The range is just as advertised, though when you approach the 30 ft mark, it cuts out. Occasionally, I find that if the phone is in my back pocket, this also can cause cut out. At the cost of a low end product, these headphones have high mid-tier worth. The bass is clear, it takes serious bass to distort them. They can sound a little tinny at times if the input is mostly treble. I've dropped them so many times and never experienced any issues. I also wear them in the shower from time to time and they are still going strong.UPDATE: Just a few short days after posting this review, the case stopped accepting a charge. I contacted TOZO and they've not only sent me a replacement case, but also an extra bonus as well, just for the inconvenience. Highly recommend!",5,1,2019-4-3,1,2,0
"I really wanted to like these earbuds, and at first I did. But I’ve tried various different sizes of the rubber tips it comes with and I still can’t get them to stay in when doing a workout that requires a lot of jumping and/or moving around, and I’m constantly adjusting them to make sure they’re firmly in place. I’m switching back to my other ones which, although not “true” wireless, at least the ear tips have a small hook that keep them in my ears. Maybe it just the way my ears are shaped but these weren’t for me.UPDATE:",5,1,2019-3-19,1,2,0
"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.",5,1,2018-12-6,1,2,1
"Every Christmas I usually have enough personal money to make an impulse purchase, usually in Electronics. This year, I wanted to upgrade the $20 pair of totally wireless sound (TWS) earbuds I had. They were good, but needed better sound to make them perfect.With a budget of about $100, I started off looking for something good from a known manufacturer (like Samsung, Jabra, etc.) There was just nothing out there in my price range. I couldn't see myself paying that kind of money from a brand I didn't know, so I started looking for a cheaper model. For around $50 I found 3-4 that looked good and reviews were good enough. I liked Anker's other Bluetooth earphones, so the Soundcore Liberty Lites were considered. With the good reviews and previous good ownership of Monoprice products the Monoprice IPX4s were looking good, too.",5,1,2019-1-22,1,1,0
"Connected these to my fire stick, which is why I purchased it so I can watch tv while my husband is sleeping. The volume on the ToZo was extremely loud. I wasn’t able to adjust it not even with the tv or fire stick remote. The volume can only be controlled when connected to your phone or tablet. I bought this on Prime Day thinking I was getting a good deal and Paid $49.99 with $3 off but found out other purchase this for around $25/$30. Two stars because they work find when connected to a phone or table but that’s not what I purchased them for.UPDATE REVIEW...",5,1,2019-7-19,1,1,0
"I absolutely love these earbuds!  I was looking at Samsung's offering since I just upgraded to a Note 9.  However,  the Tozo earbuds had much better reviews and are $100 cheaper.In the box:",5,1,2019-3-11,1,8,1
"These earbuds are amazing quality for an amazing price. They have great sound quality and are very comfortable. My ears are small so it is difficult to find comfortable earbuds, but these are great and have 4 different sizes for all ears.",5,1,2018-11-29,1,8,1
"I researched Bluetooth earbuds for several weeks.  There are so many options and so many claims.  Reading the reviews and questions on this product, I decided to give them a try.  They had EVERYTHING that I wanted in wireless earbuds.  I wanted great sound, a charging case that could be charged with USB as well as being charged on a wireless charger, the option of using just one earbud (left or right) for phone calls, great usage time, quick charge time and good range.  Also, as with any purchase I make, I look for Seller feedback when there is a problem or defect.  These earbuds check everything on my list.  I have put them through the gambit and they met or exceeded my expectations.  They easily connect to my iPhone XR.  They effortlessly connect to each other for really good stereo sound.  They have a range of 30-35 feet in my home.  You can use the Left or Right earbud by itself.  They have a very good length of charge.  Although I don't listen to music all day long (so I can't comment on the length of time they will stay charged for a whole day of music), but I have listened to a couple of hours and used for phone calls all day long and didn't need to recharge them.  They are extremely comfortable.  I have gone to bed and discovered that I still had one in my ear.  The only problem I have had with them is that I have extremely small ear canals.  I had to purchase a set of XS ear tips (SpinFit CP100-SS 3.8mm here on Amazon).  This is no slight to these earbuds though, most people will be completely satisfied with the multiple sizes provided with the earbuds.  I would and have recommended this product to everyone.",5,1,2019-8-6,1,6,0
I'm quite happy with my new TOZO T10 so far.  The sound quality is great and the bass is good which was my biggest concern when searching for the best ones on Amazon. I'm glad a lot of reviewers mentioned about the bass quality.  It's good but not as good as my corded Scosche earyphones that i've been enjoying for years.  Then again without having the cord is wonderful and an excellent trade off.  Longer will I have to struggle with the cord getting caught on the workout machines at the gym.  Just only had it for 2 days and so far so good.  Not sure about the battery life yet so i've given it 4 stars but may renew my review later.  This being my first time with a wireless earbuds I have to say i'm pretty pleased with everything so far. I would recommend this as it is a reasonable price for what it is.,5,1,2019-9-2,1,6,0
Waterptoof! Great. Sound is loud and crisp. I like for my music to remove any extra sound and these do a great job and the case is a charger you can't beat that,5,1,2018-12-4,1,1,0
"Product works well. Easily paired and so very convenient to use. I love the ability to use the right earbud while leaving the other in the case. Allows me to have a conversation while being able to listen to music. I've owned so many earbuds but this is the best for using while my head was in a pillow which helped me recuperate while being sick. Even with all of these features, the best was the customer support and follow up from the company. It's been a long time since I've had a company that I actually felt cared about my experience. Will buy many products from them in the future.",5,1,2018-11-25,1,1,0
This ear phones keep cutting out.,1,1,2019-1-7,1,2,0
"I received these yesterday and love that they came almost fully charged. I connected them right away (I was excited for new headphones, haha.)  I've listened to a few other branded headphones and they were sub par at best. These actually have a full sound. The fit of the ear buds is important, but I immediately switched to the small ear bud size knowing that's what I need. I was definitely not disappointed. These have such full sound. They have full bass and highs without being tinny. The sound is very clear and not muddy. I have daith piercings in both ears and due to these I have a hard time finding ear buds that are comfortable for long wear. These have been great. I've been wearing them all morning. I love that they cancel the noise of the room around me. I can't hear anything when music is going and everything is so much quieter if there is no music going. I love that if I leave the left ear bud in the charging case that it automatically switches the right bud to full sound instead of stereo. (I have quite a few songs that have sound for only left and right ear that pan accordingly but when only one ear bud is synced you don't lose those pieces. I work where I need to use just one ear bud sometimes and so this is an important feature for me. These have great range around the house. I can leave my phone in one room and be in a different room and still have clear sound. I've had problems with other brands and my phone being in my back pocket and cutting out but that's not an issue with these. I have only made one call so far  but the person on the other side said it was clear and easy to hear me. Its easier for me to hear the other person with these than with the iPhone speaker.I will update once I've had these a little longer.",5,1,2019-1-31,1,1,0
"The device itself, as headphones works great. The build quality is nice with a soft rubber finish. Being able to wireless-charge the buds with the case is a convenient feature. These fit me well and remain in place. These are also good at isolating you from outside noise.A major annoyance: I don't think you can use these in mono mode. The right bud will beep every 10 seconds or so if used alone. I think if you pull out the left bud, let it connect and replace it back in the case, the right bud will beep for 20 seconds (once per 10s interval) and then it seems to stop. An annoyance, but still a 5-star product at this point.",1,1,2019-3-5,1,1,0
"These have amazing sound and good battery life, but the most important feature of bluetooth headphones is staying connected.  When my phone is stationary on a counter and I'm walking around a room I experience no problems whatsoever.  But when my phone is in my pocket the earbuds disconnect consistently making them unusable.  Really wish this wasn't an issue because I love everything else about these.  Sending them back :(update:  Tozo sent me a second pair of these for free saying that they had fixed the connection issue.  Unfortunately it hadn't been fixed.  I'll reiterate the fact that these sound great and are really nice quality build along w/ the charging box.  It's also possible that it could be my phone (iPhone SE) but I found that if the phone is in my pocket the earbuds won't stay connected.  My wife used them at the gym and with her phone (also an iPhone SE) in a stationary position on the treadmill that she had no connection issues.  I changed my rating to a 3 star bc of tozo's customer service, I wish I could give it a 5 star but the connection issues are still there for me.",3,1,2019-1-9,1,1,0
"These are great IPX8 (waterproof) earbuds and case! Since I lost my first set, while on vacation, I purchased a second set of TOZO-10 earbuds.

"I am a non-paid reviewer, but was asked to review the product.4.5 stars rounded up.",5,1,2019-4-10,1,2,1
"I have only owned these earphones for one day (purchased them for $27 on a Lightning Deal), so this ""review"" is really just my first impressions.  I'll update this review if any issues come up that make me reconsider my feelings on IEMs.  I am not a hardcore audiophile, but I do appreciate quality headphones and earphones.  I'll talk first about my intial impression of the build quality, set up and bluetooth performance and sound quality.The build quality on these Tozo T2 is pretty darn good.  The case is well made and very solidly assembled.  I have no doubt it can handle a good drop from your pocket onto concrete.  I also don't doubt Tozo's claim that the case has an IPX8 rating (and I usually take those types of claims from chinese manufacturers with huge grains of salt).  The micro USB port on the case is covered by a rubber seal and the case shuts firmly and is held in place by three heavy earth magnets.  The same type of magnets are also used to hold the earbuds in the case when they are charging.  They aren't going to rattle loose or pop out unless you want them to come out.  The earbuds are also really well made.  They have a very solid feel and the plastic doesn't feel cheap at all.  Because of these are TWB earphones, they are not the lightest I have used though and, overall, they feel heavier than typical wired bluetooth IEMs.  This isn't really a big deal, since I had no issue using them through my workout at the gym this morning, including HIIT session on the treadmill and an intense weight training session.  I also tested the Tozo's claims of IPX8 water resistance rating by giving them a wash in the sink and using them in the shower.  The held up just fine and it was nice to be able to listen to my tunes during a shower!!!  This capability makes these earphones perfect for the beach or pool, where you wouldn't risk more expensive and/or delicate earphones.",5,1,2019-2-8,1,2,0
"First of all, I have spent approx. 2 hrs over the past 2 weeks looking for some wireless earbuds that were reasonably priced, and actually had real reviews.  Each time I would give up out of frustration of all the fraud in the reviews on these products..  For some reason, everytime I though I found a good set up earbuds I would look into approx. 10 reviews to see if the count and star rating was real. some of the other products actually had reviews that were for a completely different product... weird trick.  But consistently I would find a high number of fake reviews.. clearly fake.. note they typically have one review.. OR if they do have multiple reviews you will see they did them all within a couple days for cheap items.  This was the only product with a high review sample size and I couldn't find any evidence in my sampling of fake reviews.  So don't believe me, actually go in and look at a bunch of reviews for this product and see for yourself.  All I would find was reviewers with high review count, many years.. So hard to fake.  I had one other set of earbuds that looked huge, had tinny sound.  SO after my long search and finding these... I am so happy.  I just received them 2 hours ago, so excited had to do a review.  I got the white ones, Sound is excellent, bass is just right, I wouldn't say too much, or too little.. just right.- But yes it does have bass so my songs actually sound like I wanted them to.  Comes with different size earbuds sleeves... I though smaller would be better … but actually found the slightly larger sleeves were best fit, they won't fall out.  Super happy with these, search is over.  One other point is these don't look dorky big in my ears, like the previous ones I tried.  I don't know if noise cancellation is working or not.. hard to tell.. I couldn't hear the TV in the room practically at all so maybe it is working.. OR its just the earbud is blocking my ear canal.. either way sounds great.  Distance is great too, I have walked 50ft away and into my garage.. only there did it start to go choppy, but was going through firedoor and wall.  Plus says there waterproof on box.. I like that for when I exercise..  Great product you will be happy..  I'm glad this seller didn't go dishonest with the reviews like all the other earbuds.  I wish amazon would do sampling of reviews by dishonest dealers and cut them out!, rather them leave me to waste my time figuring it out.7-1-19 One update on my review.  I talked about noise cancellation.  I went and used them for working out.  Found there is really no noise cancellation.  I could still hear the music and noise around when working out, but not bad.. BUT I still love the product.  In fairness I looked again and the manufacturer didn't say there is active noise cancellation, They only mentioned something to the equalivant of noise blocking.. I.E. since there is plugs in your ear canal.  So Still very happy with my purchase.  IF you are looking for active noise cancelling.. these don't have that.  BUT still the Best earbuds I could find on Amazon for a good low price.",5,1,2019-6-29,1,2,0
"My previous set of bluetooth headphones had lost their ability to hold a charge, so I looked at buying new ones. I was only looking for something which would have decent sound quality and reasonable isolation, and something which would have better battery life. These were on sale, so I decided to give them a try.Not only do these fit incredibly comfortably, but the sound quality is very good. There's a tiny amount of background hiss (as is typical for actively powered headphones) but it's low enough that it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of the music, and it does serve a purpose in letting me know they're turned on.",5,1,2019-1-26,1,5,0
"I got the khaki, I couldn't find any pics of this color but the white would be covered in makeup so I gave it a go! I love them! The case could be called rose gold in spots but the actual earbud is khaki, I might say flesh colored (well MY flesh color lol) they work so great, perfect bass and treble. I have tried so many earbuds as of late and have been so unimpressed. I use them for audible quite a bit but I am still not settling for buds that music sounds like it's coming from a tin can😝 these checked every box for me!! And waterproof?!?! Wow. In the product info manual it actual shows you how to swim with them. As in the signal from phone will not likely go through water if you are 10m or more below surface. This is likely only a feature I would use in the shower or tub... or maybe at the pond while the kids are in shallow😉 I'm gonna also just add that I dont get into this kinda talk much but the directions with use of the terms ""slave and master"" to describe the right being the PRIMARY bud... come on... just say right is primary while left is secondary and will follow the rights lead... just fix it.... but I know the manual has to stretch across many language borders and maybe this doesnt sound so offensive in the language it was written. We Americans could do without the reference. we have to be careful not to be blase about such a serious topic. okay!! Done with that!!! Promise! Lol buy the ear buds also go ahead and grab the wireless charging plate frOm TOZO also! Works great for buds and my phone!!!",5,1,2020-1-16,1,8,1
"Just an FYI, I returned these because the sound quality wasn't great and I had connectivity issues with it. However, it is worth noting that shortly after ordering, I started receiving emails asking me to review the product and I would receive a free charging disc at no cost to me.I responded that I hadn't had the product long enough to warrant a true review and asked it a review was necessary to receive the product... no reply was given.",2,1,2019-3-21,1,1,0
DO NOT WASTE your money.  Went to use for first time and the one ear bud died with in a couple min despite charging both for over 12 hours so I assumed it was just a defective pair and sent it back to get a replacement.  When I received the replacement I knew something was off when the plastic box wrapping wasn’t even on the box.  But I charged and thought well I will give it a go.  Surprise surprise this time both earbuds died within a couple min.  This product is crap don’t even bother wasting your time or money,1,1,2019-2-21,1,1,0
"I misplaced my Samsung wireless earbuds and went on Amazon looking for a replacement.  Usually, I don't believe the ratings or hype, but I decided to give these a try because I really can't live without wireless earbuds.  This is a real rating so listen carefully....THESE EARBUDS ARE SIMPLY THE BEST PERIOD!!!  I paired these up with my Samsung phone in seconds, without reading even the quick start guide.  I did glance at the packaging and I noticed that they said WATERPROOF.  Again, I didn't believe it because for sub $50 you don't usually get everything as advertised.  Seeing that Sony, Bose (who I love) and Samsung are selling the same type earbuds with less advertised features for hundreds of dollars more.Well, I decided to wear these in the shower - since I purchased the Amazon extended warranty I figured if anything goes wrong I am covered.  Well I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!!  They performed flawlessly - hence my long review!!",5,1,2019-8-8,1,2,0
"I recommend these airbuds, because they are inexpensive and well worth the price. They are extremely easy to pair, not difficult or too techy to understand how to work them. When I wear them at the gym the outside sounds do not bother me, you can hear the music. I use them when I clean my home, when I vacuum I can't even hear the machine. You can change the size of the rubber bud so you shouldn't have a problem fitting your ears. So far this was worth the cost instead of paying $200 for higher AirPods. Great Job!",5,1,2019-4-27,1,2,1
"On February 16, I received two pairs of headphones, one pair for me and one for my wife. After almost a month of use, I can affirm that the product is wonderful, that the sound is to our liking, for which we are happy with the purchase.El 16 de febrero recibi dos pares de audifonos, un par par a mi y otro para mi esposa.

"I keep searching for Bluetooth ear buds that work for me.  I look for battery life, simple designs, ease of use, performance and durability.I unboxed the set, plugged the charger into my AC adapter.  The charging cradle has a battery life indicator.  Once the user removes the earbuds from the cradle, they appear on the iPhone Bluetooth options immediately.  They connect seamless to my phone.",5,1,2019-4-8,1,2,0
"These are the best Bluetooth headphones I've ever purchased. The battery life is amazing. The case is amazing, it's constantly charged. The fit is amazing. Now regarding the actual fit there was a trick that I did to make them fit perfectly. If anyone is use to work earplugs you know that the recommended way to apply them us to pull (the top of) your ear back and I sent the plugs in. Now, same applies to these headphones. Pull your ear back and insert each headphone in while twisting it clockwise. Once you let go of your ear the plastic piece will form to your war canal and create a perfect fit. Once I did this trick the fit was amazing, the sound was incredible the bass is 10x better. Totally recommend!!",5,1,2019-2-23,1,2,1
"I just got these today and I have to say that I'm impressed. The sound quality is very good for the price range. You can hear all the highs, mids, and feel the beat of the bass in your ear. Voices sound clear and undistorted. From out of the box and paired to my iPhone XS it took less than a minute. The battery only lasts 3 hours for music and 5 hours for talk so if that's important to you then you might want to consider other options. However with that being said the case can recharge the headphones up to 4 times before having to be recharged itself. The manual claims a 20-minute quick charge will get you 1 hour of life. They fit snugly in my ear without any discomfort and stay there just fine. There are different sized cushions for differently sized ear canals. Both the case and the headphones are waterproof. I've seen some people complain about these not working underwater. The manual clearly states with visuals that these will not work underwater as Bluetooth signal bounces off the surface of the water. If you were to ask me I'd say go ahead and buy them. Even if they aren't your main pair of true wireless earbuds then they'd make an excellent backup pair.",5,1,2019-3-6,1,2,0
"Color me impressed! I first fell in love with wireless earbuds with taotronics. However i wanted to use them to sleep with and they do not fit comfortably laying on them. They also shorted out in the shower which scared me since they are supposed to be water proof. Enter TOZO T10. I took a chance since the profile seemed smaller and it  paid off! First thing i did was try them in the shower no problem at all! Washed my hair and everything lol. I'm a side sleeper and am able to fall asleep comfortably listening to my audio books. Big thing for people is sound quality i must say these SURPASSED my expectations! I can't even listen past half volume, deep bass, clear sounds and no crackles super impressed! The magnets in the charger are very strong no issues of them falling out and the case is sturdier and battery life longer than my taotronics set. I haven't used those since i got these! Only weird thing i noticed is if you put your hand up close to the non master side the volume fades on that side it's quirky but not annoying lol.

"This is the 4th pair of bluetooth earphones I've purchased in about the last 6 weeks.  One was returned, the other two were ""meh"" and I'll keep them for backups or something, but these are definitely keepers.  Based on the pictures I thought they'd probably be heavy and/or would fall out, but they paired very easily (to my desktop PC with a 4.2 bluetooth dongle), sound great, and really are very light.  I can barely feel them, and they don't fall out.  Personally, I like sitting with just one in my ear so I can still hear if the kids want something or the SO has a question (and when I'm walking the dogs so I can hear traffic) and these are fine in that respect.  I can use one and leave the other in the charging case and they don't disconnect.  I'm perfectly happy with my purchase.",5,1,2019-3-29,1,2,0
"This is my second pair of TOZO ear buds. I had the T-8 before, and this is a definite step up. I only replaced the T8 because I lost one. TOZO earbuds work seamlessly with my iPhone. Syncing is never a problem. I like that you pick them up out of the charger and they automatically turn on and pair. These earbuds have a great sound with deeper base than anything I’ve heard except my noise-canceling OTE headphones. They are sturdy and well built but not bulky in my ear. I am often asked about them and my answer is always the same: a much cheaper option than AirPods but a high quality too.",5,1,2019-2-15,1,2,0
"I have been trying many different brands of ear buds with little satisfaction. I received these and the minute I turned them on, I was hooked. I love the many different sizes of ear caps. I have very small ears and the smallest size fits perfectly. The sounds is also fantastic, I have a very loud, obnoxious co-worker and when I'm wearing the ear buds, it's like she isn't even there. I love that they are wireless and begin to pair with my phone as soon as I take them out of the base. Also the confirmation that both sides have been connected leaves out any doubt. Phone calls are easy to answer and very clear. The carrying case is very durable and the small size makes it easy to slip into a bag or pocket for on-the-go. The shipping box and packaging are also very impressive. Also, they were charged when I received them so I could use them right away. I have to say again how pleased I am with the different sized ear caps.. Probably my favorite feature. They don't fall out of my hears and I don't have to shove them in & hurt my ear.",5,1,2019-2-18,1,2,0
"Ok this is an update about this product, as i statetd nothing is change about sound...however they did not stays in my ears due the small canal i try every size of silicone and foam, espacially when im chuwing something in my mouth they fall off easally , so it is not the device it just me so decide to return them.First the sound qualilty is awesome for the price nice base, trible...they sound much better and louder then Jabra active at $180, call quality i am not sure yet, ill update on that, for the fitting i have small ear canal so staying still working on it , but the main thing is the sound is very rich and if you want to customize that get the poweramp app for android you want regret it.",5,1,2019-2-23,1,2,0
"The last time I bought a wireless headphone is last year with a Bose Quiet Comfort II. Owning another two wireless headphones from Taoelectronics in addition to the Bose, I do not have much expectation for this pair of tiny earbuds, but I was blown out of the water when first putting them on. The sound quality is vibrant and deep, and very comfortable, does not feel heavy at all.I read many reviews before buying that mentioned about the lack of bass, which I found the complete opposite as these earbuds are kickin' hard, in which I have to turn down the volume. Technology has advanced so much in the past few years, and these earbuds surpass my Taoelectronics headphones (Vava Moov 25) in 2014 by a mile.",5,1,2019-2-19,1,2,0
The headphones came in the mail and after getting them to full charge I went through the process of the setup. Bluetooth worked perfectly for both earbuds. Its important to select the Tozo-R after your device picks up the signal. Sound quality is absolutley perfect with a deep sound (not tinny) and they are plenty loud enough to block out noise around you. They fit and are secure in my ear. Very comfortable. They seem built well enough to be durable however time will tell if they last.,5,1,2018-12-20,1,2,0

"I searched all of Amazon for the best Truly Wireless earbuds. I debated several but settled on the TOZO T10s because the size of the speaker driver. I figured if it is bigger than most than sound should be produced better. Anyway, I got them yesterday and all I can say is WoW! The sound is simply what sold me. I want a headset to be loud, have bass and clear highs, these definitely deliver what I was looking for in earbuds. I am using the original silicone tips it came with but I will be swapping it out some comply foam tips I have for another headset. Just to give you an idea these actually sound better than my Jaybirds X3. I have yet to test them out in water and test the battery life but from a sound point of view I love them!",5,1,2018-12-29,1,2,0
"I bought these to use while swimming laps after reading some positive reviews. After making a successful pairing with my iPhone, I jumped in the pool to get started with my workout. As soon as I took my first stroke both ear buds went dead. Then the right one came back to life and would only work when I took breaths and wasn’t in the water. I put the left ear bud on the deck and continued swimming with the right. After working intermittently throughout my workout it eventually completely shut down and hasn’t turned on since despite getting charged back up. Very disappointing so still on the lookout for a true pair of waterproof ear buds.",1,1,2019-3-9,1,1,0
"First of all, you've got to remember these are not $250 Apple earpods.  I've given them 5 stars because I am completely satisfied with my purchase.  If you're an audio engineer, you should probably check out the reviews from other, more sophisticated users, especially where the audio fidelity is concerned.I love the way these pair with my iphone.  I don't have to do anything, I just remove the right earbud from the case, it turns itself on, and pairs with the phone.  Take out the left earbud and it pairs with the right one.  I don't have to touch the phone or press any buttons.  It's completely automatic.",5,1,2020-3-5,1,7,0
"Let me start by saying these are terrific!  The build quality is solid, packaging and presentation are nicely done and the sound is truly surprisingly very good with much better bass than something this small normally has.  I'm very pleased with these.  I had a pair of Phaiser's wrap around Bluetooth earbuds and they were far more finicky and not durable.  So came here looking for a replacement and wanted something that could handle sweat and found the behind the wrap annoying.  So gave this shot and wow, these blow the Phaiser earbuds away.  The charging storage case is a great touch and a useful place to store these after a work out.  The only warning I'd make is these are tiny and dark, so if you drop one of them, which I did, they're not easy to find.  The unit comes with several sized ear cups,  the standard size turned out to be a bit too big for my ears, they include two sizes smaller and one size larger.  The smallest size works best for me.  So try them for fit before going on a run,  and change if needed.  I went with the standard size out and one fell out, when I began to sweat.  Wasn't easy to find in the early morning light, but did and no harm or issue with it.  I changed the cups when I got home and now the fit is more secure.  I'd buy these again in heart beat.  Love the freedom of this style of wireless headbuds.",5,1,2019-2-3,1,1,0

I purchased this product after reading through all the great reviews and great expectations. What I experienced with this product has been a mix bag.It pairs easily when removed from the charging case with the first device and with the left channel. The sound quality for music and movies from my iPad are pretty decent.,1,1,2019-4-23,1,8,0
I bought these ear buds mostly to use while at work so I wanted them to be wireless and a bit discrete too. These earbuds are great for me. I was worried about buying earbuds off amazon cause of all the scammers out there but these have impressed me quite a bit. They are pretty small with a decent connection range and great sound quality. I was wondering how well they would stay in cause I would be moving around a lot and I also have pretty small ears but they stay great they come with different size buds which was great. And it also has a somewhat portable charger. It has a case that can hold about a four hour charge so u can charge ur buds while on the go if they die out on yay. Overall a great purchase for me I’ve recommended them to a few of my coworkers.,5,1,2019-2-2,1,9,1
"Excited to have these little ear buds. I was excited to try them out so much that even though I had to be somewhere, I paired them before I drove off in my car. As soon as I was out of my driveway, I made a call to test sound on the other end. I did not get these earbuds to use in the car and don’t know if that’s a suggested use or not. This was me being anxious to try them. The other party could hear me well and couldn’t tell that I wasn’t actually on my phone. What I noticed was how much noise was cancelled out. I never thought my car had very much road noise being as new as it is but while I had the earbuds in, it was almost eerily quiet. I could lightly hear the bumps of road cracks and the party on the phone said they could barely hear it as well, so I felt we were hearing at the level.The buds seated well in my ear and felt comfortable for the amount of time I had them in.  They are not bulky at all. In fact, looking straight, one would be challenged to know I have them on. (see photo)",5,1,2020-2-22,1,5,1
"I'll be completely honest: I did not expect anything amazing from these earbuds. In fact, I was entirely prepared to receive them, use them for a day, and send them back due to poor quality.I was happily mistaken.",5,1,2019-1-27,1,2,1
"Initially I was having trouble getting the earbuds to fit properly; they were sticking out where they should have been more flush with my ear opening…  After a few attempts I finally got them in right, (see bottom row of image) but it was a challenge at first; helped to stand in front of a mirror. Once you get it right it makes sense and is a snap to fit. It was my first set of Bluetooth earbuds so it was on a steep learning curve to figure it all out at once.Trying all the different sized tips (included) was useful, finally settled on the medium sized ones with good results. I found that learning to put the buds in, in front of a mirror at first was helpful, as was licking the tips for lubrication made the task easier. It takes a simple rotation of the bud to the back that locks the bud in the right position. Once you get it right and see how it fits, it gets easier.",5,1,2019-6-22,1,2,1
"So I had a pair of Bose Wireless Sport Earbuds that I dearly loved and cost me about $200.00.  Unfortunately (and this is I swear, a true story), my dog ate one of them... I nearly cried.  Now understand that I work out at a minimum of 3 times a week - usually 4, and I sweat like the Beast.  I cannot wear (nor stand) the Apple earbuds and was desperate to get another pair ASAP.  Yeah, well I was having a hard time swallowing (pardon the pun) another $200 expenditure on a replacement set of Bose buds... Enter the TOZO. I saw that these got a high rating here on Amazon and figured at a 1/4 of the price of the Bose, I'd give them a try.  Man!  Am I glad I did.Any of the other good reviews on here pretty much sum up how I feel about them.  They're about 1/2 the size of my Bose (see image), stay in place while running and doing cardio, pairing is a breeze and reliable,  and the battery time is excellent. The bass is solid and the highs are clear.",5,1,2019-8-29,1,2,1
"This is my first set or truly wireless earbuds, but I made sure to read up on features and see reviews before purchasing.  My biggest hesitation before buying was that I was worried that the sound quality couldn’t possibly be as good as my trusty wired earbuds.  But, after reading many of the reviews on many other types, this one came back with a lot of good comments about sound quality, so I gave in and ordered them in white.Now i have only had these for a day or two, but I am happy to report that the sound quality is actually As-Good as my wired ones, which themselves were great.  Not only that, the bass quality was right on point as well.  Huge plus.",5,1,2019-7-10,1,2,0
"FINAL UPDATE (#2):  I am updating this review after getting to examine a 3rd pair of earbuds and finding that they were completely trouble free.  I have kept all previous reviews below for completeness sake.  Quick version:  I got a bad pair, but I was quickly sent a replacement, and have used a 3rd pair.  The 2nd and 3rd pair worked flawlessly (the first pair were clearly not the “normal” quality) so I feel compelled to update my review based on this.  I also discovered that if you have a wireless charger (like one you use with your phone), you can rest the charging case on that wireless charging pad and they charge!  That’s so convenient.  I am also finding them to be very comfortable and I enjoy the sound.  Great for the gym!UPDATE 1:  TOZO contacted me by email and sent me a new pair of earbuds.  These earbuds indeed work fine and don't have any issues at all.  I think TOZO understands the importance of reviews and very much wants people to give them good reviews.  I would say they are even a bit aggressive about their customer service. They were always incredibly polite and professional, but they wanted to be sure I got the second pair to try.  I can appreciate their hard work in trying to make sure that I walked away with good things to say about the product.  I have now given this 4 stars because the final product works great, but the fact that I got one that seems to be way too susceptible to interference won't allow me to give it 5 stars in good conscience.",5,1,2019-6-5,1,2,0
"I purchased these to listen to music or audio books on my walking commutes. They have never died on me, and my walk is 80 minutes - which is more than I can say for the last BT earbuds I had. I like the earbud receptacle/battery charger case. I not really impressed with the noise cancellation, but that's not a big deal for me (I've read that NC is primarily designed to cancel jet engine noise, and doesn't handle a wide variety of random frequencies well - what I experience walking home with traffic). These also stay in my ear better than the last set I had, which would fall out when I ran (it not fun trying to find the little buggers). They sound fine to me, but I'm not an audiophile and have some high frequency hearing, so I'm not a good judge of audio quality. I would purchase these again.",5,1,2019-6-27,1,2,0
"I've been using ""wireless"" earbuds for the last few years, and although they're more convenient than wired ones the fact that they still are connected to each other with a wire pretty much still makes them a bit ""in the way."" I loved the idea of the AirPods being truly wireless and having a secure storage case that charges the earbuds but I didn't like the design of the earbuds themselves or the shape Apple uses as I prefer in-ear ones. Paired with a high price tag and average sound quality I looked on here to see what true wireless earbuds were available and the Tozo T10s stood out the most. They have the in-ear style earbud, compact charging case, and are very affordable. There are many different wireless earbuds to choose from but I really like the small design of the earbuds themselves, not too long, and don't come with any wing tips that take a bit longer to line up in your ear. Also the charging case is the perfect size, not being too tall or wide, and unlike the majority of other charging cases it can be charged wirelessly and is IPX8 waterproof. The sound quality of the earbuds is very good for my needs of connecting them to my Apple TV and iPad to watch TV shows, YouTube, and music. They usually last between 3-4 hours of listening out of the case which is great and when you do put them back in the case they charge back up very quickly and you can get several recharges out of the carrying case itself before it needs recharged, which also is very fast to charge up. The best method to have the earbuds pair to each other quickly and then to your device is to remove the Right one first, and very quickly (half a second after) remove the Left. That way the right starts searching and as soon as the left one comes on it picks it up and then immediately pairs to whatever device you're using. The only two things I don't like is since the right bud pairs to the left it counts as a connected device and then you can only connect to one other device (for example an iPhone.) It seems even bluetooth 5.0 still can only connect to 2 devices at the same time but since the left earbud counts as a connected device that really only leaves you one. So if they're paired to my Apple TV (which never shuts off) then if I want to connect them to my iPad they'll auto connect to the Apple TV if they were last used on it so I have to manually disconnect them and then they'll pair to the iPad. The buds both have a clickable button but it only does Play/Pause or answers a call, and if you long press it redials the last number you called. I rarely make calls on my iPhone and even if I do I'm not going to use the earbuds with it, I only use them for music and video, so I would prefer that the button functioned as media controls. One button can control several playback features (for example, I press is play/pause, 2 presses is skip forward, and 3 presses is skip back, and since both earbuds have a button one long press on the right could be volume up and one long press on the left is volume down.) Although it's not a big deal, I think those features could make these earbuds truly perfect and hopefully they can release a newer model with those features as I'd gladly buy another pair.",5,1,2019-7-2,1,2,1
I like everything about this product.  The design and diversity,5,1,2019-2-26,1,2,1
Great product.  These bluetooth headphones are a perfect mix of things that I want.  Waterproof and truly wireless.  Use one or both and while they are labeled right and left put them in whichever ear you want as they are the same shape.  Wireless charging is quiet convenient as I already wirelessly charge my phone and can now just use the same pad to charge the case which charges the headphones.  So far I am very much enjoying them and look forward to much more use!,5,1,2018-12-10,1,2,0
"I've gone through several wireless ear buds in my day, and this one really works well. The sound quality is good (not for audiophiles, but for your average music listener). The design is sleek and can easily fit in my pocket; the case and the buds also look pretty good, though I would say it looks a wee bit bulky; I personally prefer the white. I haven't had any concerns of these buds falling out of my ear with the standard fit it came with (there are other fits supported as well) while biking and some gentle walking; very minimal re-adjustment is ever needed maybe every hour or so. The price point makes this particularly attractive. I've also had very little issue with the battery life, being able to listen for several hours without any threat of the buds dying. The nice thing is the charging case, so you can re-charge on the go up to 4 full charges! That's awesome. The fact that the charging case works with wireless charging is just extra icing on the cake here.",5,1,2019-7-2,1,1,1
"I bought a pair of these earlier this year and gave a 1 star review. This was mainly because the left earbud would constantly disconnect. The manufacturer told me I just got a defective pair, and that they would send a new pair if I was willing to delete my review. This seemed fair enough, and they quickly sent out a new pair once the review was deleted.Unfortunately, the new pair has the same issues as before, and I would recommend not buying these. The sound quality isn’t bad, but the non stop cutting out of the left earbud is a dealbreaker when it comes to wireless earbuds. I appreciate that they were willing to make this right, but 2 pairs of bad earbuds don’t help anyone. I highly recommend spending more on a better brand.",1,1,2019-9-17,1,1,0
"I really wanted to like these ear buds. The sound quality is decent and they're pretty comfortable, unfortunately it's all for nothing.  Bluetooth connection is incredibly poor on the left ear bud and cuts out constantly rendering them unusable. I have read other reviews with people that have had a similar issue and don't want to risk an exchange just to get another defective pair; I will be returning these for a refund.",1,1,2019-3-20,1,7,0
"I've only had these for a couple days, but I put my stuff through the wringer. I carry the mail in Ohio and I use these to listen to J. Vernon McGee's Thru the Bible while I walk. I have already had them out in the pouring rain and they worked perfectly. I'm no audiophile, but I hate tinny sounding cheap headphones. I'm extremely picky, and that's why I sent back a set of the mpow BT earbuds, and another that I can't remember the name of. Both sounded very cheap. These have deep bass, and are very loud. I deliver mail on a busy 4 lane and have absolutely no problem hearing the sermons.I am always moving and have never had one work its way loose. No need for adjustments at all. I put one in, and it stays where I put it. THE BATTERY IS BETTER THAN ADVERTISED. I only use one earbud at a time for safety reasons, so I use one until it starts telling me the batter is almost dead, and then I switch out. When you switch to the other one, you have to open the blue tooth menu on your phone and have it forget the one you are disconnecting and then repair the other one. Takes about 10 seconds literally. I'm just happy that you can use either one independently of the other one. The last pair I tried advertised that you could, but the right bud was the only one that actually connected to the phone. These TORO's are awesome. Work better than I expected to, and I will definitely shop with them again.",5,1,2019-2-8,1,7,0

"I've had these for about 6 months now and I love these.No more annoying wires dangling around my neck.  And no wires needed to charge this.  The case itself charges wirelessly, and the earbuds charge in the case.  This means I don't have to worry about finding a charger that fits.  No need for lightning connector, USB C, Micro USB, etc.  This charges on any wireless base there is.",5,1,2019-6-18,1,2,0
"I bought two of these, one for my self and one for my husband. My husband charged and set up his set right away. He got a phone call from his boss while wearing them and my husband said the clarity of their voices was excellent, his boss said he could hear my husband very well. We both wore them to the gym and for me the sound was amazing! My husband has not had anything to wear to the gym like this and he was thrilled! He got to listen to his favorite music and workout. When I used these to listen to my music I found the pairing to my phone easy. Pairing to my ipod was a bit more complicated probably because I made it more complicated. They played my music beautifully and the sound was very good. The battery life is something we're waiting to see about since we just got these on Monday and just really used them yesterday at the gym. So far this has been a great purchase. I hope that sometime you can make a longer play time, longer than 3.5 hours with all of the great things there are with these earbuds. We are very happy with our choice!",5,1,2019-9-18,1,1,0
"I have to say that I have a pair of Bosè QC-35 as my primary headphones. But in summer they get steamy, and for travelling they are rather big, so I started to look for some more portable and smaller headphones. I didn't want to pay $150 for some Apple AirPods, so I did a research and found this TOZO.  And I love them. I've had them for a couple of weeks, and I'm still on the ""you're-the-love-of-my-life"" phase; so, I will try to be as objective as possible.[Sound Quality]",5,1,2019-7-2,1,1,1
"I needed a new pair of earbuds for work and my wife surprised me with these. At first I was a little skeptical because I've never heard of the brand, but I gave these a chance and I was pleasantly surprised with the sound and build quality. I've owned many of the high dollar brands before and these sound, look and feel way more expensive than they are. For the price you can't go wrong. They are waterproof (I use them in the shower), come with their own wireless charging case, the cancel out noise very well and they sound AWESOME! I was a little worried they wouldn't be loud enough, but they are plenty loud. They are as loud as your phone or other device will allow. For these features and quality you should expect to spend many more times the asking price, but TOZO is doing us all a favor and are offering these at a great deal.I did have an issue with my set though when they first came in... At first they worked awesome but out of nowhere the right earbud just stopped working and nothing I tried would resolve the issue. Fortunately these come with a warranty (which is another thing you won't find at this low price point) so I contacted customer service and they helped resolve my issue straight away. Customer service was helpful, polite and FAST to act on my issues and everything has been sorted out to my satisfaction.",5,1,2019-9-1,1,1,0
I bought these headphones for my wife. She has a busy job that she needs to be talking on the phone and decided on these as they look super convenient with the charging cable usb.She loved them.

"I was highly impressed at the sound quality of these earbuds! Great noise cancellation, great bass, and all around great sound! The bluetooth range is highly impressive as well. I am most impressed by the battery life, at 4 to 5 hours of listen time and approximately an hour for a full charge. The battery pack can charge the earbuds 3 to 4 times before it needs to charged too, which is much better than I anticipated.I also need to add what wonderful customer service I recieved from the company! I accidentally put one headphone in the washer with my jeans, for about 5 minutes, and the headphone broke. The company was more than happy to issue me a replacement pair, no hassle and no run around! I highly recommend these earbuds and this company. Five stars isnt enough!",5,1,2019-8-28,1,1,0
I really like how comfortable these ear buds are and so light weight. The sound quality is really good also. And the fact that they are waterproof is awesome due to the fact that I work out in the rain at times. Great product.,5,1,2018-12-10,1,2,1
"I’m really pleased with these earbuds. They are well made and sound great. I was even surprised by the charging box and how the earbuds snap into their dock with magnets. Although they came fitted with silicone earcaps that were too big for my ears, they also come with other sizes so I was able to easily change them out. They feel snug and comfortable now. I also like that they are waterproof - I’ve worn them in the shower and can’t wait to wear them this summer in the pool.I debated on putting 4 or 5 stars (would give a 4.5 if I could), and the that’s only because the charging box doesn’t seem to hold a charge as long as I would expect. The earbuds themselves last for most of the day of continuous play, but when they’re in the box they’re constantly charging and that drains the battery on the box. But in the big scheme of things that’s not a major problem, especially if you carry a backup battery around like I do for my phone.",5,1,2019-3-21,1,1,1
Great Value. Got on Amazon to just find some quality ear plugs for swimming.  Stumbled across these and for the negligible price difference decided to go with these. They fit great I am a big guy but have small ear canals so having the different adapters was really nice. I had to use the smallest. They are comfortable and have no problem staying in when working out or even swimming.  While they are water resistant they are not 100% water proof in that you can't just drop them in the pool or wash them under running water. As long as they are in your ear they are waterproof providing they have a good seal in your ears and your not diving beyond 3 feet. Sound is good. I'm no HIFI expert but the sound is good with high highs and good bass response as well. Range is great. Note when swimming that when you go under the water the sound will break up or cut out all together due to the signal being blocked by the water. This is not the fault of the earbuds themselves.,5,1,2019-4-27,1,1,1
"Ok I have been looking for weeks on Amazon for a good pair of affordable True Wireless Earbuds and originally had purchased the Sandoo Earbuds. When the Sandoo earbuds came in I was so excited, but that excited lasted about half a day because the ear buds would cut in and out if you even thought of touching them and they sounded terrible as well. The Sandoo earbuds were $10 less than the Tozo Earbuds, but they were recommended by Amazon so I decided why not buy them to have one more shot at finding a good pair of true wireless earbuds before I gave up. The Tozo earbuds showed up at my house and I couldn't wait to open them up to see if they actually worked as advertised and omg WOW WOW WOW!!! They most certainly do what they promised and sound amazing. From the packaging to the actual product itself I am literally amazed. I mean only Apple has a system like that where the packaging is just as nice as the product and Tozo you are knocking things out of the park. How do Apple Earpods cost so much when the Tozo earbuds sounds just brilliant. The bass is awesome, the mods are awesome and the highs are awesome and not to mention I use these while working out in my garden and then come inside and jump right into the shower with the ear buds still on never missing a beat.

"Right off the bat people said they couldn't hear me - no matter how loud I turned up the volume, they couldn't hear me and/or couldn't understand me. Then the left earpiece just went out. I turned my phone on and off, just in case it was the phone. Still couldn't hear out of the left ear piece. The instructions say to choose the ear cap size that fits your ear. What??? There's only one ear cap in the box! According to the instructions they have S, M, L & XL, but the different sizes aren't included in my box. So there I am working out and pop! The right ear bud bounces out of my ear. Basically they're not what is advertised. Do not purchase.",1,1,2019-4-2,1,5,0
"I purchased these headphones on a flash sale, so I got them at a reduced price. I figured, even if I don't like them, they weren't that much. I haven’t had them very long, but I’ve been surprisingly pleased with them.So far, I’ve used them mainly at my office to watch Netflix during my lunch break. I have on a couple occasions used them for a few hours without any problems with the batteries running out. I really like that the carrying case holds a reserve charge to recharge the headphones when put back in.",5,1,2019-2-15,1,7,1
"Wow, I gotta say, the seller is committed to happy customers!I submitted the review below, and the seller reached out, asking what they could do to make me happy.  They offered to send me a different pair, so I took them up on it.  Again, to be clear, the sound in the original pair was impressive, especially for the price-point, but I was disappointed in the top volume.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,5,0
"These sounds great, but they wouldn't stay in my ears during a mild walk, let alone working out. I tried all 4 ear bud sizes and none of them held it in my ear, because they are just too heavy and bulky.Very disappointed. Update the seller reached out to me and has offered  to replace with a newer version.",4,1,2019-1-4,1,5,0
"UPDATE 03-05-2020:  updated to 1 star.  Charging case stopped taking a charge after a little over 3 months. As you can't charge the ear buds any other way they are deadUPDATE 03-14-2020:  These were just past the Amazon return window so there was no recourse there.  Tried contacting the seller on my order with no success (note the seller shown on the listing has changed 3 times since I ordered in Nov) so I could not leave seller feedback.  I was only contacted after leaving the 1 star review and then only to offer a $20 gift card to remove the bad review.  This on a $50 purchase.  I only wanted a replacement item, but they would not do this.  I tried to meet them half way for proper compensation for my purchase and annoyance ($70).  They seemed to agree then backed out looking for full deletion of the review or a 5 star rating. NOT HAPPENING!  These sellers seem to be directly tied to the manufacturer and they will not stand behind their product and actively try to cheat the system.  My original review is at the bottom.  Here is the email thread of them trying to buy the rating.  Sorry its long, but you'll see the kind of people you are ordering from. It calls into question EVERY good review.",1,1,2020-2-4,1,3,0
"I have been so jealous of all my friends with the AirPods, but I’m one of those strange Alien-hiding-among-you types who cannot keep the regular Apple cordes headset earbuds in my ears to save my life.I have been doing a LOT of research and I was going to plunk down $300.00 for the Sennheiser True Wireless earphones, but after doing some digging (yes, I saw ALL of the YouTube videos with people freaking out about the sound quality of the Sennheisers) I realized the charging case for the Sennheisers isn’t wireless charging capable — it doesn’t sit on an induction-charging Qi pad like these (the TOZO T10’s do and that’s a big deal to me. ESPECIALLY in a product called “True Wireless” .",5,1,2019-9-22,1,4,1
**Update 5/10/19**The exact same issue is happening with the replacement earbud set. Right ear stays connected to the phone and has no issues what so ever. The Left earbud drops signal every 1-2 seconds. No amount of resetting fixes the issue. Very disappointed.🙁,2,1,2019-5-6,1,2,0
"I bought these to use with my iPhone 7 Plus. Right out of the box they are impressive. The charging pod is solid, and I like that it's magnetic. Position the earbuds near where they go and they magically pop right into their place. The USB cable is only around 10 inches (25 cm) which is a little inconvenient, but I have half a dozen other USB cords to use. The earbuds must have had some charge because I only plugged in the pod for a few minutes and they were ready to test them out. Be careful to read the instructions about pairing these. It's pretty easy, but you should only pair the RIGHT (not left) earbud to your device. The left earbud pairs to the right one automatically after you remove them from the pod. At first I mistakenly paired both the right and left to my device, and the result is there was no sound through the earbuds. To rectify this I had to go into my phone Bluetooth settings and forget both devices. Then I started fresh and everything worked fine. The sound quality is pretty good. I would like a bit more bass, but I'm spoiled by mostly using larger headphones. At first I was a bit dismayed, because there seemed to be an excessive high frequency response, making hiss and noise much more noticeable. I then remembered I could use the EQ feature on Apple Music to tailor the sound better, and now I'm satisfied. The color is a nice deep blue. The ""R"" and ""L"" imprinted on the buds does not stand out as much as it seems on the picture, which is a very slight disappointment. I purposely picked this color because I wanted to see this better with my old eyes to tell right from left. I mainly bought these to listen to music on dry land. I have not tested the mic or water resistance so I cannot speak to those. The package includes both earbuds, battery equipped charging pod, 10 inch USB to mini USB cable, lanyard, 4 pairs of earpieces for sizing (including the ones already on the buds), instruction booklet, quick-start guide, and warranty card. As some have stated already, you do not need a wireless charging pad to charge these. You charge the pod with a cable and the pod charges the earbuds. So far as I can tell the battery in the charging pod is not removable.",4,1,2020-2-8,1,3,0
"Very disappointed by these. Tried all the different sizes of earpieces, but these buds kept falling out of my ears with only slight head movement. If you have small ears, maybe these will be ok for you. Otherwise they are a waste of time and money. I also was unable to find the buds on the Bluetooth on my android phone, though they showed up on my iphone. Finally, the English in the instructions is awful.",1,1,2019-3-20,1,3,0
"My previous wireless earbuds Trexab were about 4 years old and battery was only good for a few hours. They were comfortable had good sound, but a thin cable that went around the neck. If wanting to listen in one ear only, the ear piece not being used would drag down, and become a hassle. Time to replace, looked at wireless ear buds and knew I didn't want to shell out hundreds on a good product. I found these and the reviews were god. Decided to give them a try, the sound is quality, the multiple size ear pads make for a perfect fit. The charging case seems sturdy enough and when you put the buds in to charge, there is a strong magnet that pulls them down securely in the right position. My only suggestion is to include a longer charging cord, it's only about 10 inches long. However I have a plethora of charging cords that I can use that are long enough to overcome. Worth the money, i highly recommend.",5,1,2020-2-29,1,2,1
"I've only used these a couple times so far. I have the smallest ear pieces on and it still barely fits properly. I feel that if I actually run, instead if cleaning the house or taking a shower, that I will constantly have to adjust to make sure I don't lose one. My music sounds great but my friends say on phone calls, they can barely hear me or that I sound far away. It picks up all the background noises better than my voice. I'll give them a few more days before I complain or send them back. Probably wont make a difference.",3,1,2019-1-12,1,3,0
"Extremely disappointed. They paired nicely, had a good fit and sounded great for almost 10 seconds! Then the left ear bus kept going out every few seconds. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting several times and there was no change. Even tried with another device and same disapointment. Sadly I will have to return them. I was really hoping for some nice wireless ear buds.",1,1,2019-3-21,1,3,0
"Received my Tozo T10s a few days ago.  I wasn't familiar with the manufacturer so I was a little hesitant to order at first, but given the great reviews and great price I decided to give them a try - worst case I could return them.Well, I can say with certainty that I will be KEEPING these earbuds!",5,1,2019-11-23,1,2,0
"For sure I thought, “With 12k reviews, it should be GOOD”!  I wasn’t going to sit around and read through every single one of them.  Most reviews were 4 stars.Ordered a pair about 3-4 months ago.  Pairing it was straight forward and easy, no issues.  Once paired, noticed the left and right kept disconnecting from each other.  At first I thought it could’ve been due to having little to no reception or a bad connection.  So I uninstalled it and reinstalled, same thing.  I checked and verified that the case had charge, I didn’t charge it as the 3 blue LED indicators was lit up to show battery level (¾ way charged).  I thought maybe I needed to charge it (being a china product) so I let it sit plugged in for an hour.  Listened to it after fully charged and …. you guessed it.  Same thing.",1,1,2019-10-8,1,2,0
"UPDATE: After contacting the support team I was given instruction to reset the earbuds, and this seems to have nearly if not entirely fixed the issue  (it's still too soon to speak definitively but I can say that my limited tests show them to be functioning more reliably, though not without occasional issue). In case this is helpful to others, I am including the instructions for reset.There are 3 steps for the reset steps:",1,1,2019-11-30,1,2,0
"I have never owned bluetooth earbuds and was hesitant to buy these ones from TOZO- what if the sound quality wasn’t all that good? What if the connection was bad? What if the earbuds didn’t fit my small ears?Let me tell you, these earbuds are everything and more you could possibly need from bluetooth earbuds. At first I found them uncomfortable to wear, the smallest size earbuds were still too big. I reached out to TOZO and they had an amazing and fast customer service team that helped send me an even smaller earbud size for free! After registering my product for the 1-year free warranty, TOZO actually reached out to me to send me (you guessed it) another free item but this time it being the wireless charging pad and I quote “to ensure I was completely satisfied” I already was but now I'm just over the moon at this point- guys, this company not only has really good quality earbuds for a steal of a price, but also amazing customer service; so if something doesn’t seem to be working for y’all, contact them, don’t just get frustrated and return it, this company is like no other.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,5,1
"Received product the following day after ordering, received as a gift and very impressed with the quality of the product. The earbuds are small and lightweight.It is very easy to set up and comes with a simple instruction card. The case is lightweight and I like that it has a place to attach a lanyard. Charging the case with the buds inside and I can test them out this weekend!Weekend Test: worked perfect for a roadtrip and a chore day. Works with one ear bud at a time or both. The ear pieces have a prerecorded notifications to let you know when the ear pieces connected, disconnected, has an issue or low battery. You have the option to connect one or both through Bluetooth. The sound is clear and crisp with little static and background noise when no audio is playing. The buds do have sufficient bass. I used on the lowest volume setting and the ear pieces blocked out all background noise. Was great to use one bud while driving for calls or upbeat music while others were sleeping in the car. The buds lasted me the entire weekend without charging from the cable. So buds and case has plenty of battery life.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,2,0
"These are my first wireless earbuds. In my case, I will primarily be using them to listen to spoken voice podcasts, therefore sound quality may not be as critical for me as for those who want to use them for music. I can also get by with a minimum set of touch functions to pause and play podcasts and answer/disconnect phone calls.Pairing with my iPhone went very smoothly. I'm pleased that there are several sets of different pads as I plan to purchase another pair for my spouse should these work as well as I think they will.",4,1,2019-9-22,1,6,0
"Absolute crap. Crapped out after two days of work. Stupid me got rid of the box, so I can't return it. The left and right ear buds keep alternating connecting and disconnecting,  it's annoying as hell. And as soon as I place my phone in my pocket, the signal gets choppy. This was an absolute waste of money.",1,1,2019-4-6,1,2,0
I was pretty hyped up to try these but I was quickly disappointed.  Headphones work great when I'm looking directly at my phone but when the phone goes into my pocket.... sound cuts out intermittently.Updated Review:,4,1,2018-12-22,1,7,0
"They are great for the price. Very stable connection between the two pieces and the phone or whatever you pair it to.Sound is good... I wouldn't say it is great as i find is no way to increase/decrease the volume and unfortunately  no firmware updates, which you wouldn't expect for the price either.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,2,0
So this product lasts until just past the return window. Convenient. They worked perfectly fine for a month. Then over the last week have not held a charge and there is zero way to contact about this. The support is only for setting up. But they simple pretty peices of plastic and wires now. No matter how long I charge them plugged in or on the base. They work for 10 mins and then blink low and turn off almost instantly. Would be nice if I could get a replacement or just a refund so I can try a different brand. This. Sucks.,1,1,2019-4-2,1,2,0
"These are of an okay quality. The sound quality is just good, albeit a little grainy with heavy music. Batty life is also very short, only around 3-4 hours of active listening. This may seem sufficient but for a commuter, it's a nuisance having to recharge so frequently. They also don't fit comfortably in the ear, and are prone to slipping out (not suitable to the  gym). I've tried multiple sizes for the rubber and the earphones still fall out, sometimes in the middle of the street. The left earbud also chips out at random times, even when I'm being sedentary. That being said, these are not terrible earphones. The small size makes them very portable. If you want average sound quality and don't care about connectivity or battery life, these may be right for you. I will be returning as I don't believe they are worth the price.Update 3/21: The company reached out to me and offered a replacement that's a different model from the one shown here. I am increasing my review from 3  to 4 stars, in compliment of the customer service received.",4,1,2019-1-24,1,2,0

"I got these earlier today, but from what I can tell, they are the best bang for your buck. The noise 100% cancels out when you have music on, even when it is on the lowest volume! The sound quality is very good, although there is a veryyy faint buzzing sound when you aren't listening to anything, it isn't noticable when you have music playing. I already love these so much, plus they are only $40!",5,1,2020-2-17,1,3,1
"I'll start off with the good. The sound quality and base for the price of these is great. The costumer service from this company is also amazing, however the product has some major problems. It took 3 tries for the company to send me a pair that worked. I'm happy with them now that I have it, but the quality of product can't be that good if they came in broke. Altogether it was a good purchase for the price, but only if you get a working pair.",3,1,2019-1-3,1,2,0
"1st.. pairing is infinitely simple. Just pick the buds out of the case, and they immediately turn on, pair with each other - if you're quick, you'll hear a clear voice indicating left, right pairing success - and when you pair to your device, it's just as simple. Be sure to look for 'Tozo T10 -R', because the Right bud is the master, and the left bud will slave from it. You'll never see the -L bud in your pairing lists.Right now, I'm using them on my laptop for music.. my tablet + Roku app which allows me to listen to television privately thru the Tozo, and of course, my phone for calls + music.",5,1,2019-8-26,1,4,0
"I knew going into this that I was not spending $150 or $200 for earbuds but having used the Apple AirPods I have to say that this has amazing sound for music and audiobooks/radio streaming.  Amazon HD tracks sound wonderful with great highs and respectable base.  Volume is louder than would ever be needed.  The seal blocks out a HUGE amount of sound and while they don't have ANR they almost feel like they do.  In fact, they are so sound-isolating that I found myself taking one out from time to time to be able to better hear the world around me.They paired instantly out of the box on my Note 10 and stayed synced.  There are super stable in the ears and I don't see them falling out short of really trying hard to make that happen.  The single button on both the R and L pods work as they should.",5,1,2019-10-22,1,4,0
"I just wanna say flat out these are some quality Earbuds for the price you pay for. Before I had previous Earbuds that were cheaper, but not as good as these. My previous ones were made out of a glossy finish which sucked when it came to sweat and earwax. They would always fall out my ear no matter what! Until I took the time and came across these now I know why so many people are buying these!-They have a matte type finish which is good against grease/earwax",5,1,2020-3-9,1,2,0
"First off my fault for not looking at the battery life.  But barely 5 hrs and I didnt even play anything for some of that time.Then same issues as the other 1 star people.

"We've been undergoing renovations so the private office life has been disrupted and I'm now in a shared office space which means that unfortunately those who had no respect and complain about everything showcase that to a much larger extent. While these are not noise cancelling, with one in, I'm able to tune out the quieter conversations and as it gets louder, I can put in the other one and hear very little over the music even on a lower volume. I'm quite impressed with how comfortable these are, usually I can't stand anything in my ears but these are light enough that they aren't a bother and barely noticeable. I do recommend testing out at least two of the sizes for the rubber pieces to make sure that they fit.My husband has the T6 style, but I wanted the T10 because of office calls. They aren't Bose quality but I'm able to have conversations with minimal static. Overall we're both very happy with our TOZO purchases. Mine are slightly larger but it's barely noticeable. We both agree that my case is better for charging, but his case is more compact and easier to carry in shorts at the gym. Mine would be better tossed in a bag rather than a pocket just because it's larger, almost the size of my computer mouse.",5,1,2020-1-17,1,1,1
"Great product for great price. I was worried about the fit, and it possibly falling out my ear.  But it fits perfectly! Very comfortable, and easy to use. I love the ease of automatic connecting and disconnecting as I remove it or put it back in the charging case. I've only had it 1 day,  but I used it at work, and in the shower.  Im not sure if it's possible,  but when using only 1 earbud,  its seems like it has to be the Right earbud,.. but maybe I have a mess with it more.Overall,  I highly recommend this product!",5,1,2018-12-12,1,8,0
"First thing I noticed was the look and feel of these earbuds give off a quality built product.The earbuds automatically turn on when removed from the case. After inserting them into my ear and rotating them into place, they felt very secure. Both earbuds proceed to tell you that they connect to each other as a pair and once syncd via Bluetooth to your phone, will say Device Connected. When you put the earbuds back in the case they automatically disconnect from your device and turn off to be charged.",5,1,2019-1-28,1,7,1
"I really wanted to love these. The sound quality is excellent, they are super comfortable, and I loved the idea of being able to wirelessly charge them. However, they just don't hold up to use. The left earbud CONTINUOUSLY cuts in and out, especially when I am moving, which basically defeats the entire purpose of using them. It's so distracting. I've unpaired and repaired them several times, and even restarted my phone, all to no avail, I've only worn them three times and the problem just keeps getting worse. I was so happy with them at first that I threw away all the packaging and can't even return them. Very disappointing, especially for the price. :( Maybe you'll have better luck.[update 2/12/19] The seller reached out to me and offered to send me a new pair, which was wonderful, and I added one more star for their customer service (although they did send me way too many emails bugging me about updating my review).

"This was the first product that I really wanted to go out of the way to review the moment I turned them on. However, I wanted to give them some time to make sure that I would still be satisfied with them a few weeks down the line and all I can say is that I have never been more happier with a purchase. I really enjoy these.The moment I tried them, I was immediately impressed with the sound quality as it was multiple times better than the wired earphones that came with my Samsung Galaxy s9. With my previous earphones, I would still manage to have a hard time hearing the majority of audio even at maximum volume.",5,1,2019-2-15,1,8,1
"The sound quality is great. They stay in ear well when working out. The biggest down fall is that the left and right bud do not stay streaming at the same time. Audio on the left channel drops in and out when music is playing for the slightest reason. Head movement, phone movement, standinging still... it’s very annoying if your trying to get into a groove to have one ear bud just stop working for zero reason. For that reason alone I give it a 2 star because that is over all terrible quality for headphones.—-update—-",2,1,2019-3-16,1,6,0
"I hated these. I started a return no more than 2 minutes after popping them in. They lack in volume. I had the volume all the way up and it was woefully insufficient.

"Waste of money. I was REALLY trying to avoid  paying a ton of money for some earbuds but unfortunately I learned the hard way. These earbuds are absolutely garbage. Sure the sound is fine but what difference does that make if they don’t stay in long enough to hear anything? I don’t know how they have such high ratings, but these do not stay in your ears at ALL. I’ve tried all 3 ear piece sizes and no success. Even darn near jamming this things into my ear a few seconds later they’re falling out and need re-adjusting. Not worth anything now, but so bad I wouldn’t even give these away. This is literally money in the trash as this is where these buds ended up. Spend your money on better quality.",1,1,2020-1-1,1,1,0
"The left earbud cuts in and out repeatedly (every few minutes). The earbuds lose contact with the device. This problem exists on an iPad Pro 11 inch (latest model) and on my laptop. I should have listened to the other reviews. I plan on returning these to Amazon. Very disappointed because they do sound reasonably well.P.S. Tozo support contacted me wanting me to do a product reset (on a brand new item?) and to watch a series of videos for instructions on how to use these earbuds. Odd for something that is purported to be automatic pairing. BTW, I did the reset as instructed and it failed.",1,1,2019-5-5,1,1,0
"I really wanted these to be the ones that worked since they didn't have a cord, but they were not at all good. I thought maybe changing the earbud tips they provide would make a difference but they don't. They just dangle in my ear, about to fall out and the sound sounds as though the earbud isn't in all the way. Then when I push the earbud in further, it is a larger part of the earbud that finally makes contact with my ear enough to hold it in. I just don't think that the part that holds the earbud in my ear is the part that is suppose to. So after having the earbuds in my ear where I think they should be so they don't fall out, I can't have them in longer than 30 to 45 minutes because they hurt my ear.Then the button on the earbud is not as easy to push as it should be so when you need to push it, you do so pretty hard which hurts your ear even more.",2,1,2019-3-27,1,1,0
these are great one of my only complaints is that you can only pair the right ear Bud so if the right here but dies you can't use the left ear Bud they do not pair independently which is absolutely a horrible idea.  They sound good they feel good in the ear noise cancelling isn't too bad and I do appreciate the hard pressed button on the side instead of some models that have a touch so I can take them out to listen to somebody without having to shut off my music.,4,1,2020-5-31,1,1,0

I’ve had these for a month. Here are honest pros and cons.PROS:,3,1,2019-7-12,1,1,1
"These are horrible. I've been using them for a month but my issues started 2 weeks in. First off, I needed earphones that would allow me to have a conversation on the phone without having surrounding noise be an issue. These do not so this. At all. Anyone on the phone can hear everything going on around me. So that was strike one.Secondly, these earphones do not automatically pair together or to my phone, together. They pair individually and I therefore have to manually connect them to my phone every time I use them, and then also manually have to select to hear from both of them, every time.",1,1,2020-2-5,1,2,0
"First of all, I LOVE music, and I expect great performances from all of my equipment.  Which includes my phone, my TV, my speakers, and my headphones.I received my TOZO headphones today. So I wanted to put them through the test.",5,1,2020-2-9,1,3,0
"I don't write reviews of every product that I order.  But these earbuds are truly great. I previously purchased the earlier model, TOZO T8 earbuds. They had really good sound, but the bluetooth connection was ""iffy"".  These new earbuds DO NOT have that problem at all. Now, I don't wear them swimming or in the shower (how long are your showers?), so I can't vouch for the waterproof quality. But I bought the new model earbuds because of the sound quality, comfort and convenience of the T8 model.  I can tell you that these earbuds, in my opinion, are even better for true sound and great range. They're comfortable and conveient to carry along in your pocket, purse, etc.  The battery in the recharge/storage case lasts FOREVER-- or at least it seems to.  And the recharge/storage case has nice blue LEDs to indicate how much charge is left in the case's battery-- this is really a very nice convenience.  Based on my pair of the TOZO T10 earbuds, I think you will really enjoy them, too.  So stop hesitating.  ORDER THEM!",5,1,2019-1-30,1,2,0
"UPDATE: Lowering from 3 to 1 starI received an email from TOZO staring that they would replace my order with an upgraded item due to the original 3 star review.

"****Update 1/24/20 (a year later)**** for the price, these are still great, but after a year of moderate use (maybe 30-60 minutes 5 days a week) my right earbud has ceased putting out any sound. It still connects to the left bud and my phone, but there's just no sound. I've run through TOZO's reset protocol a number of times to no avail. I'm pretty sure whatever warranty I had is expired, however, for 40 bucks I am very happy with the use I got out of these. Unfortunately, this is a prime example of the Commander Vimes' ""Boots Theory of Socioeconomic Unfairness."" I'll end up spending more on inexpensive earbuds that don't last than I would if I could spring for a set of expensive ones that do. Such is life. Not changing my star rating since I got a full year out of them. Should I expect more from budget buds?Original Review:",4,1,2019-1-30,1,2,1
"Ok, what I don't really like is that the connection is shotty because it only stretches 10 meters(and I wouldn't even say that...)They are good ear phones I just haven't found a way to change volume and/or song without manually without phones. But I may also be spoiled by Ifrogz wireless headphones. I really wanted to try the true wireless headphones without paying 160 for them, but I don't have experience with other headphones like this...",1,1,2019-3-14,1,2,0
"I love the feel and look of it, ordered a white one. The case feels sturdy and has a strong snap once it's closed, it's about the length of my plam, approximately 3 inches long.The sound quality is nice however I did hear a bit static here and there but not very noticable. The first time I used it to watch a video, there was no delay then I used it a second time to watch a video, I noticed a very faint delay but maybe it was because I had been using the earphones for quite a while and draining the battery, I'm not sure but will update later. I will say that these earbuds connect very fast! I was very impressed at the connection of it. I did use it for calling and the sound is crisp and clear. The person on the other line did hear me well and there were minimal to no background noise from my end of the call.",4,1,2019-9-4,1,5,1
"AMAZING...... especially for the price!I own BOSE Bluetooth earbuds retail $200+ and they don’t come close to the sound quality of these. Also not as water resistant, nor do they have Base like these little ones. They fit better than any ear buds I have ever owned. I literally can’t find anything about them I don’t like? The wireless charging, robust case with strong magnetic hold and the cases power level lights ALL far surpass the much more expensive Bose that I own. Now I am a HUGE Bose fan. I own many products by Bose and the earbuds I own are great quality and sound. However, to my surprise, these are superior. You may be thinking why even buy them if I like my Bose so much? I originally planned on giving these to my mother in her stocking. She is very particular about her, well anything, and not very savvy with electronics. I wanted to see if she would like them or could even figure out how to use them so I opened them and tested them out. WOW... that’s all I can say......! Oh and a guarantee too.... worth every penny!",5,1,2019-12-17,1,2,0
"So I want to preface this with a statement saying that this company, Tozo, attempts to bribe people to leave good reviews, so keep that in mind with all those 5 star reviews. Now for my actual review. It sounds good, Takes way too long to get a full charge when a full charge only lasts like 2.5 to 3 hours. You know those old RC cars where you charge them as much as you can use them? Yeah that's what these reminded me of.  Waterproof seems to work fine though. They are comfortable in my ears at least.  Won't work without both being connected to each other and if one is on the charger they both disconnect. One will not work independently unless the other is in your pocket, which is not independent functionality, so dont listen to those questions that are answered that say they work independently.  The low battery warning is about 10 seconds before they die, and interrupts whatever you are listening to with s voice telling you.  Should just be a low beeping in the background, maybe on a future product?  Also, true independent functionality, with the water proofing and a full charge in about 15 to 20 minutes, I'd pay a little over 100 bucks for if you guys had it.  I tested these and the link between the two can be spotty, seems to be rare but it happens. One loses signal from the other and you hear the beeps as it tries to reconnect and then they work again. With that, I have maintained a connection between the two from about 50 ft away, more and they disconnect.  I do really enjoy the design, and their charge pad, nice quality charge pad and gorgeous but I'll go write that over there too.  The case has a very strong and satisfying snap as it closes that is nerd asmr.",1,1,2019-6-11,1,1,0
"I liked them at first but the battery life is terrible. They don’t always completely turn off and on and will randomly turn back on in their case and waste battery life. I can get very few hours of battery with it. They also don’t have the best Bluetooth connectivity with my devices and I have to manually connect them in my settings every time I use them (minor issue, but annoying). The sound quality and noise cancellation is great, but because of the poor battery life I rarely reach for these- the barely last through 40-60 minute max workouts. I use my Bluetooth headphones instead.Update: I lost one of the earbuds on a trip. I was upset that I lost of half of what I paid for, but the product was useless anyway. I’m looking forward to finding a pair that actually charges consistently.",1,1,2020-2-24,1,1,0
"I've been searching for a true pair of wireless headphones and ordered these. I run long distances and was tired of the cord with other options.There are many positives with these headphones. They sound good (for what they are), sync easily and have a good long charge.",4,1,2019-1-9,1,1,0
"Firstly, the hardware for these earbuds are really great. I love the fact that the button is a clicky push button instead of the capacitive buttons you see on many of these headphones. Good battery life though I haven't tested extensively. The case a a little large to be comfortable in a front pocket but not terrible. Not too heavy, pretty comfortable in the ear and really good sound.The issue with these is that a couple small things ruin the overall experience for me. Firstly, I use 1 earbud at a time a lot, probably more than I use both together. When you first put a single earbud in your ear it connects then searches for the other earbud to connect. The problem with this is that, whoever wrote the firmware for these, decided it would be a good idea to have the earbud beep every time it runs the search for the other earbud. So, every 7 seconds or so for about a minute after you put it into your ear, it beeps at you and there is nothing you can do but wait for it to time out. For someone who puts the buds in and out of his ears many times throughout the day this got old and unacceptable real fast.",3,1,2019-4-10,1,1,0
"I received my headset a few days ago.  I liked the sound, the weight and comfort of the headset but people couldn't hear me. So, I called Amazon customer service and they told me to keep the defective headset and sent me another one which I received today.  The previous set was defective.  The replacement set works great and operates seamlessly for listening to music and making or receiving calls.  I have them on listening to music while working at home and when a call comes in, I click the button on either side and I'm on the phone.  I highly recommend this set.  Don't give up on this set.  Apparently the manufacturer does not have a good quality testing program based on the reviews.  I'm glad I stuck with this set and didn't return them.UPDATE of my review:  I received the replacement headsets yesterday and still have the same issue. Returned to Amazon for full refund.  They only asked for one set back.  The set that I still have will make a good Bluetooth headphone.  I will buy a cheap headset this time since my Plantronics that cost as much as this one switches back and fort to the phone in the middle of the call. I give this thing a one star review for having wasted my time.",1,1,2019-6-14,1,1,0
"1st off let me say these are my 5th or 6th try at getting great sound out of ear buds.  I was thinking that it just wasn't doable.  Ordered these earlier today and they showed up early evening, wow and wow.  Went with white as I am tired of losing things in airplanes and gyms.  Nice change.So, sound quality:  WOW.  I listen to a lot of Latin: Prince Royce, Romeo Santos, Aventura.... things with lots and lots of harmonies and mid range percussion, bongos and crazy things.  To FINALLY get buds that bring out that myriad of sound is an answer to a prayer.  Clear, crisp highs, clean drums and mid ranges, clear voice.  The base is just right, very present but not overwhelming.  Listening to Daddy Yankee Dura, holy crapioly,  amazing percussion....  I feel like breaking into Zumba!!!",5,1,2019-8-25,1,4,0
"I bought these because I like to listen to audiobooks while working. I only keep one earbud in, in case if a colleague drops by to discuss something with me - its easier to hear them when they first approach me that way.Because I get up from my desk a lot, the wireless feature of these was important. Previously with my wired earbuds I'd always have to pause my audibook, take the ear bud out, go to my destination, come back, put it in, un-pause... this gets annoying when you're repeating this multiple times each hour. With the wireless earbud I can leave it in - in most cases don't even have to pause my audiobook since I don't typically travel too far from my desk - I can be listening to my audiobook while waiting at the printer, etc.",4,1,2020-2-18,1,1,0
"This product is very frustrating.  It works wonderful when on. The 2 problems are the case/charger is always charging even when unplugged there is always lights on. So it charges through the reserve and the drains itself. The second problem is that there are extremely bright lights flashing from the ear buds every 5 seconds. They are SO distracting everytime they flash, that you can't even enjoy a tv show in bed without the lasers flashing all over your pillows or walls, or in my case. My wife trying to sleep next to me.",1,1,2020-3-3,1,1,1
"I like these headphones. But the battery life isn't quite what i would need. It seems like that are constantly sucking battery even when i'm not using them. I have to keep them plugged in and can't go far from my charger. Which sort of defeats the purpose of being wireless. However, if you have a short ride or only use them in small increments then you'll love them. They are light weight and comfortable on your ears and the sound quality is decent for an off brand. Overall a good pair of headphones.UPDATE: the customer service at TOZO is amazing. They read my review and reached out to replace my headphones. They may have been defective. Highly recommend this company.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,5,0
"Pro-Sound. For the earbud under $50 and compared with higher end earbuds, this is good enough for every day use. Well.. being really exact not every day use and it'll be explained in cons.",3,1,2019-2-13,1,5,0
"I love that these stay in your ears , they have great sound , easy to use , very sleek ! I also love the wireless charging , just put them in the case and they charge , it’s a great way to store them and keep them charged! Ok I love them !!!!! Great Price too!!",5,1,2020-3-1,1,2,1
"I needed a set of ear buds that were truly wireless and didn’t require a lot of hassle. I also didn’t want to drop a load of money on air pods and after comparing different brands, I decided to give these a chance! They are absolutely perfect!! The case it small enough to fit in my wristlet that I wear to the gym, the case holds a lot of charge and I’ve actually only had to charge it one time since they came in. It also doesn’t take a lot of time to charge. I really liked that they are water proof too, but I haven’t did anything to really prove that feature just yet and I don’t plan too honestly. It was super easy to connect them to my phone and to each other which took a lot of worry off of me because, I’m always afraid I won’t figure stuff like that out.  The sound quality really surprised me and had a lot of bass! It was really nice to have a bunch of different sized buds to choose from because, the original ones were just a tad too big for my ears. I would totally buy these again and I’m actually thinking of purchasing a pair for my boyfriend since he’s in the same situation I am. One more thing I appreciated was the string that the case hangs on. I can put them on the mirror in my car or on the handles of the tread mill or around my neck Incase I don’t wear my wristlet. I love them!",5,1,2020-3-14,1,8,1
"I’ve been wanting some excellent wireless headphones for a while now. I tried the Apple AirPods but they just about drove me crazy. They would fall out of my ears all the time and did not give any noise cancellation. (I know that the newest ones now do that, but I’m not willing to pay 180+).My husband has the Jabra wireless earbuds that his work paid for. He’s really liked them and I did consider them for a bit. However, I really wanted white earbuds and their golden color just wasn’t close enough.",5,1,2019-12-3,1,4,0
"Very hard to keep in your ears. Dont stay connected to blue tooth well while working out. Didnt come with diff inserts for ears def not one size fits all. Other then that they seem decent.

"When I bought these, I only used them for music and they seemed fine.  As I was unfamiliar with a variety of earbuds, I did not know that these are actually very limited compared to other ones.  Many competitive products like the $59 TaoTronics SoundLiberty 77 Earbuds are also waterproof but provide controls to change volume, track, play/pause, and even use Google Assistant/Siri directly from the earbuds.  That alone makes these earbuds very limited and and not a very good value, but I had a much bigger problem with these.The audio for calls would only pick up voice at about half volume or lower.  If I get really loud, only then can the person on the other end of the call understand me.  Since getting these, I've purchased several other earbuds for different purposes and when tested with my phone or my spouse's phone, they all work perfect for calls except the TOZO earbuds.  The issue is not with my devices or setup, it is specifically the TOZO ear buds.  I contacted support and after 2 weeks they responded asking if I would accept a 20% refund asking if I could please not return these.  At the end of the day, why would I want a slightly lower priced pair of earbuds that still do not work?",1,1,2019-11-4,1,1,0
Update 2: one side doesn’t charge anymore after less than a year use. Dropping stars for durability.UPDATE: I was thoroughly happy that this earbud made it thru the 2 hr half marathon. I made sure it was fully charged and never tested it for this long. I got nervous at mile 12 when one side start to fade in and out. Not sure if it was the sweat or what but I notice that more often now even after a short run... for that losing a star.,3,1,2019-3-7,1,1,0
"I am definitely a fan.  Sound quality impressed me with deep base. Love the fit. Was sceptical about them holding in place but they do, even during jogging (never tried sprints). Magnetic holder for earbuds and cool feature of a lanyard. Case is very well built and is the charger for the earbuds. There is a feature for a wireless charging pad but I do not have one so I cannot say how well it works. The battery life is good. I have used it for 2 hours at a time and each time it dropped 1/2 the battery life so I would assume around 4 hours of constant sound. I have made phone calls and was told the sound is clear. It will not connect to a PS4. Have not tested water resistance but have worked up a good sweat at the gym wearing them with no issues. I have the blue but I wish it came in green. I liked these so much I also purchased another set for my wife (khaki) and she loves it as well. Price is well worth it.(Update)",5,1,2020-2-4,1,1,1
"I purchased both the BEBEN 5H wireless ear buds and the TOZO T10 wireless ear buds, for use with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Android phone. Prior to these purchases, I have been using Anker bluetooth (wired-to-each-other) ear buds; the Anker buds have served me well for a couple of years, but I was looking for truly wireless for a couple of reasons (I won't waste your time with those reasons--I suspect if you read them you wouldn't care).I checked out reviews and ratings for several brands, and settles on these two:",3,1,2019-9-7,1,9,1

"UPDATE 2 -----I received the replacement headphones quickly thanks to their prompt service. For whatever reason I still have the same issue where the left earbud loses connectivity. It's really awful in some situations, other times, it is fine. It seems to occur more outside. I've tried everything to get it to work correctly. Turning off powersaver on my phone, etc. etc. Great service but the product just needs to be improved so that it works all the time.",1,1,2019-7-5,1,9,0
"I already have an excellent pair of earbuds, what I was looking for was a pair of EarPods that I could swim with. Based on the reviews, I thought I had found such a pair with the Tozo T10. Unfortunately, the moment my head went under the water, these  earbuds lost connectivity with my Apple Watch and ceased to work. Presently the left earbud doesn’t work at all. This is all from a brief moment of submersion. These earbuds sound very good, but you can find equally good sounding buds for less money. If someone knows of a pair of earbuds that can actually be used to swim with, I would love to know about those. I can say without hesitation, that these are not the earbuds I was looking for",1,1,2019-5-20,1,1,1
"Update: I've inquired more than once about getting the extra small eat tips, but while a customer service rep answered other questions, they failed to respond to the issue about extra small ear tips. Since the earbuds keep falling out, with the left earbud falling out more frequenty, as well as causing ear pain using the small ear tip, I guess I have no recourse except to return them. It's also cringe worthy that the seller is bribe me to better my review.Original review:",1,1,2019-10-29,1,9,0
"UPDATE AT 30 DAYS: I’m really not a big review writer, but these headphones are definitely worth the price! The noise cancelling aspect is great. I sat on a 3 hour flight with a screaming baby, with the head phones in, no screaming! Wonderful! I now have the wireless charger and it works perfect too, and charges my iPhone. All in all, 30 days in, totally worth the $30.Good wireless headphones for the price. Worth the buy.

"Admittedly, for the first 3 minutes of owning this product, I was pleased. I do not like the look (or price) of airpods, so I was on the hunt for more affordable and aesthetically pleasing wireless headphones/earbuds. The reviews for this product were very good, so I went ahead and purchased them. To make a long story less long, I was trying to read more about how the two earbuds communicated to one another, so of course I picked up the instruction manual. It detailed how I should connect the left earbud, ""the slave"", to the right earbud, ""the master"". I have no idea how this sort of racially-triggering product description was put out there for public consumption. Referring to pieces of plastic as slave and master is also just unnecessary - they could have simply been called right and left earbuds. I had no choice but to return these despite the 3 minutes of excitement I felt upon first trying them out.",1,1,2019-4-4,1,1,0
"I was playing my iTunes music when I got a phone call. When the call ended, I got a small display asking if I wanted to go back to : speaker, iPhone, or TOZO T-10 earbuds. I selected the earbuds. Immediately, a strange item popped up saying I had just purchased an album, ""Media Legends,"" for over $50! I hadn't done any such thing! There was also a ""link"" leading somewhere (of course I didn't touch that). Within a day or two, an Amazon purchase I'd made using a debit card was declined. Then another. Seems my card had been hacked via these ear buds. My card provider told me they'd (thankfully) refused all the new charges which amounted to probably over $5,000! So BEWARE these earbuds, or you may be spending lots of time trying to straighten out your credit card mess!",1,1,2020-6-22,1,8,0
"I love these earbuds!!! The quality of sound is great. There is good bass and music sounds clear and rich. I have no trouble hearing or being heard on phone calls. The battery lasts as long as I've ever needed them to but the case holds a charge as well so can even be charged on the go without plugging in. They charge wirelessly on a pad or using the charging cord included. It is a standard micro usb. At less than half the cost for Samsung galaxy earbuds, I am very happy with this purchase and definitely recommend them as an alternative to more expensive or name brand buds. The only downfall is that you cannot control volume or skip tracks with the buds. You can start/stop music and answer/hang up calls with the buds though. All in all, I'm very happy with these!UPDATE: After about a week of use, I decided that not being able to control the volume directly from the buds was a deal breaker. I hate having to grab my phone to adjust it when I'm walking around the house doing things. Also, I use a device to connect them to the TV and they are too loud to use and adjusting the tv volume does nothing. The newer model, T6, has these controls but is not available in gray and case is more like airpods. I want these with volume control! Ugh! I truly love these but need volume control on them. I have not decided on a replacement yet. Again, I still recommend these if volume control and track skip control from them is not an issue for you. It was for me.",5,1,2020-1-17,1,1,0
"Update:Tozo teqched out to me and offered to send a new version of the BT Buds. I immediately opened the package, switched to the smaller size tip and inserted them into my ears.

Once paired I was about blown off my couch by the crystal-clear sounds and excellent bass.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,6,0
"This is for BOTH the T10 and T6 TOZO EarBuds:  Purchased two of the T10 earbuds for myself and son (in Khaki and Blue). Loved them, no problems at all.  The push button can be a little tricky since you are pushing into the ear to use those functions (mute, forward, back, etc), but you get the hang of it and learn how to grip the bud to click it rather than push it ""into"" the ear.  I like that you can pop the bud out while the music is still playing and pop back in, as opposed to the T6 which is touch sensitive and you only need to tap lightly.  But again, you learn not to paw the bud and you grip by the side instead.  The T6 does save stress on the ear because it requires so little effort to tap.  If you have large hands and get frustrated easily, you may opt for the Push of the T10 over the Tap of the T6 so you are not always hitting pause or forward, etc.I lost one T10 bud, and found the newer T6 in Pink so I opted for those this time, simply because I love pink.  Turns out, the T6 buds will charge in the older (larger) T10 case! But not the other way around.  Sound quality is better on the T6.  HOWEVER you won't know what you are missing with the T10 if you don't own both.  So honestly I wouldn't use sound as a qualifier for purchase and really look at the cases, the tap vs push feature and the colors (my humble opinion).  The T10 case is bulkier, but has a see thru lid, which I like and a loop to hook it to something for carrying.  The T6 is slimmer and can slid into your pocket or purse easier.  Removing the buds from either case is easy, however, easier from the larger T10 case.  The T6 does require a little more pinching to get them out. Again, not a make or break deal.  These buds, whichever you choose will not fall out when running or exercising, they are snug. Pop them in give a little wiggle turn and you are set!  Can't speak yet to the water proof feature.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,5,1
"I loved everything about it, the sound quality, how clear it sounded, and how easy it was to use.But these stupid things seem to only pair with phones.  I've tested it with multiple phones and I've never had an issue with anything with bluetooth pairing to my PC before including my older and cheaper bluetooth earbuds.  I really wanted to be happy about this product except for the 1 thing keeping me from enjoying them and that's using them on a computer.  I've checked and my motherboard supports blueooth 5.0 at least and it should be able to pick up these earbuds but for some reason it's like they were built to only be used with mobile devices.  I wouldn't recommend unless you were fine with just using them on  your phone and I'd avoid any other of their wireless headphones to be honest.",1,1,2020-2-10,1,7,1
"I initially purchased these Bluetooth for the sole purpose of using them for calls. They initially worked great during the first two weeks. The setup was so easy that a child could do it. However, after the two week period when I removed them from the case and placed the right side in I would hear that it connected and then disconnected. I deleted the Bluetooth  from my phone and did a set up numerous times and the problem still existed. Needless to say, I gave up and sent them back! I really did not want to spend $250 on EarPods but I guess I will have to....May 21, 2020: I was contacted by the vendor who sent me the T6 model for free. This was done with the intent of me updating and/ or deleting my previous review. I also believe that all reviews of a product should be honest so that it can save future customers the stress and aggravation I went thru. Well I tried them out and I am sticking to my original review. Except now I can add that the T6 model was difficult to disconnect a call. I had to disconnect a call from my phone. Also, I later went back and looked at my Bluetooth connection and there was some strange connection that was not added by me. I always keep my Bluetooth off on my phone when not in use, so had to do with T6.",1,1,2020-3-5,1,6,0
"Fairly impressive for ~$40 after discount until the R earbud quit syncing after one month.  The audio interruptions while you're moving that other users reported was my only real complaint before that.  Tried every troubleshooting recommendation including resetting them multiple times but still only able to get the L to pair to my phone's Bluetooth.  Took a video of them going haywire in the charging case the other day too which was interesting.  No response from customer support and past the point I can return them which is frustrating.  Ended up buying Monster Bluetooth Earbuds 5.0 (audio brand I've had great luck with historically) which were ~$100 but definitely worth the extra money so far - superior touch controls, sound quality, ear ergonomics, connectivity range from source device, no intermittent breaks in audio when moving, and most importantly no pairing/connectivity issues between the two earbuds so far!UPDATE: Tozo did reach out to me several weeks later and offered a replacement pair of T6 earbuds or a $40 Amazon gift card.  Not sure if I had a defective pair but customer service and overall experience was good in the end.",4,1,2020-4-5,1,6,0
"These earbuds sound pretty good, but unfortunately they constantly discharge when not in use. I will charge them completely, and then go to use them a day later, and they're totally dead. I can tell by the lights on the charger, that they're constantly being charged. I tried turning off the bluetooth on my phone, and even ""forgetting"" the earbuds on my phone, in the hopes this would solve the problem. Unfortunately, it didn't. So, basically, you have to charge these earbuds every time you use them. If you don't use them for a day or so, even if you fully charged them, they will be completely dead when you go to use them.I bought two pairs of these earbuds, and they both do this, so I don't think this is a defect with an isolated pair, but a flaw in the design of the product.",1,1,2020-4-9,1,6,0
"If you only want these for there waterproof then go ahead. Microphone is terrible making it rather frustrating to talk to someone. If both earbuds aren't connected you get an annoying tone every 8 seconds or so. Earbuds lose connection between themselves quite often.

"For the price I would say 5 stars, but it does have its disadvantages compared to other same priced earbuds I also gave 4 stars too. Its comparing apples to oranges as I like things about both the top earbuds in this piece bracket. So I will compare them both and let you decide what is for you. The TOZO T10 vs  OFUSHO F16The Ofushu seems a bit heavier and slightly better quality. Its battery case has a huge battery compared to the Tozo. The Ofushu also has 8 hour play time compared to 3 hours on the Tazo. The Tazo is ipx8 if that is important to you compared to ipx7. So why do I prefer the Tazo over the Ofusho.",4,1,2020-2-25,1,5,1
"I bought these earbuds for running, although I admit I was curious about the swimming functionality they advertised.  I paired these with a Pixel 2xl, which I have used with other BT headsets.  Here are my thoughts after using this a few months:1 - Fit - Several ear bud sizes come in the box so if you're lucky one of them will fit.  I found a pair that worked fairly well and had a decent seal, but my daughter (who admittedly is only 12 and has small ears) couldn't get any to fit.  Good for me since I know she won't be borrowing these, but also sad as I had to strike these off my gift option list.",4,1,2020-2-18,1,8,0
I just got these today so I can’t make a comment on battery life just yet.First the good things - easy to pair. Sound is good and clear. Noise cancellation is good. I put them in and can’t hear the tv at all. Packaging is easy to open.,4,1,2020-1-16,1,5,1
"I just received this product yesterday so the battery, noise canceling, and sound quality I haven’t yet had a good chance to test; however, I’m surprised at how I like the way it looks and feels. The case is about the size of a portable computer mouse or about a little less than 1/3rd the size of a regular computer mouse. There is a power button on each device with the L and R to signify which ear to put it in. It feels like the case magnetically shuts and comes with a lanyard. The earplugs are slightly bulky but I like them world’s better than the way the iPhone earplugs look (just plain ridiculous having something hanging out of your ears).Having said that, today I will give it the first field test as I need noise canceling earphones/plugs (whatever) to help me concentrate.",5,1,2020-1-16,1,9,0
"Hey guys! I purchased these earbuds with two things in mind: noise cancellation and needed great quality for meditations/binaural beat sessions.Product itself: very nice packaging, great look. I ordered the khaki color and it’s ok but with them in it looks like I’m wearing huge hearing aids.",3,1,2020-7-15,1,2,0
"I bought this as gift to my sister. It had so many positive reviews. But I was disappointed- the ear piece is very bulky, stands out of earlobe, falls off easy. Its case is too big in comparison to Apple. Don't trust the illustration - it's not what it is in reality. Don't believe in reviews anymore",1,1,2019-12-26,1,8,0
"This is the first time I am using wireless Airbuds of any sort so I read alot of reviews on many different brands and I chose this. Firstly I chose this because I was satisfied with the reviews that I have read. Although i have never heard of the brand it did sound quite impressive to me. Also, being on a budget I wanted to get something valuable for my money. I only started using these about a week now and i must say, i was worried about if they would hurt my ear, to be honest I barely feel them, I even fell asleep with them once or twice because they feel so non-existent in my ear. They come with different sizes of the actual 'earplug' so you have to try which one is suitable for your ear.  The sound is wonderful, it's very detailed, you hear every instrument crystal clear through these babies. I have used earphones in the past and because of background noise the person you're speaking to automatically know that you're connected to a device, but with these,  the person on the other end does not hear that background interference AT ALL.  The noise cancellation is great, kinda scary, makes you feel like only you in the world matters. It's a great product. I cannot wait to use it at the gym.  I have not used it in water as yet to give a review of that but I was in a little rain and that has not affected the functions at all. I will greatly recommend this to anyone.",5,1,2019-10-20,1,9,0
"My wife has been using wireless earbuds for a year or so, but I'd been sticking with my wireless over-the-ear full size headphones because I believed they did a better job of isolating or cancelling external sounds. Plus, because they were bigger, they'd produce deeper base than buds, right? I tried her two different brands of buds a couple of times, but wasn't satisfied with the sound of one pair, and the second pair, well, they sounded good but they lost connectivity so often they were essentially useless.I did some review-surfing on Amazon and found these highly rated Tozos, so I decided I'd give them a shot.",5,1,2019-9-28,1,1,0
"I am so disappointed. When I first got these headphones I could not help but rave about them to friends and family, but less than 2 months later and they are practically useless. The headphones stopped pairing with each other and no amount of troubleshooting has allowed me to get the left bud to connect to the right or vice versa. I can listen to one headphone at a time which, to me, is useless. What is the point of noise cancelling headphones when you can only use one.I should've read the other one star reviews instead of seeing the large quantity of positive reviews and assuming there would be no issues.",1,1,2019-11-13,1,5,0
"I'm almost 70 and had my hearing tested recently and know my hearing doesn't extend much beyond 8 kHz.  I used to work as a recording studio engineer so I am aware of what is good audio quality and what is bad.  Even with my loss of HF hearing as I get older, these dang things are still waaaayyy too heavy in the treble to my taste.  I can only imagine what they must sound like to a younger person.  That's too bad as they seem to be a very well built high quality product.  What were the design engineers thinking?  I'm returning these for a refund.",1,1,2019-12-17,1,6,0
"I bought these along with a cheaper set of bluetooth ear buds at the same time.  Of the two I prefer the cheaper set.On the plus side, the sound quality on these is pretty good, they have reasonable volume, and the range is acceptable. I tried them in the shower once and they seemed to be fine afterward, so the water resistance thing seems to be legit.",2,1,2019-5-6,1,6,0

"Reviso mi reseña tras haberlos usado durante 10 meses. El sonido es bueno y el encaje en el oído no genera dificualtades, si bien pueden soltarse al hacer ejercicio. Más allá de esto, empezaron a darme problemas de carga y alcance a los 10 u 11 meses de haberlos comprado, hasta finalmente no tomar carga prácticamente. Contacté al equipo de soporte de Tozo en más de una oportunidad, estando dentro del plazo de garantía, y ni siquiera responden a mis correos. En este momento la garantía ya expiró así que me he quedado con dos trozos de plástico totalmente inútil, desperdiciando mi dinero, mi tiempo y mi paciencia.Consejo: no compren estos auriculares si esperan que tengan una duración decente o si esperan confiar en el servicio de soporte o garantía.",1,1,2019-6-6,1,1,0
Sound kept dropping out in the left earbud.  Not sure whether it was a bad Bluetooth connection or a short in the earbud. Battery life was right at the 3 hour life as advertised. I am sure this would have gotten worse over time.  I returned the product after using two times.07/24/19 update: Vendor contacted me and offered to send me a new set of earbuds free of charge to test and review. I am revising my original one star rating to three stars for good customer service. Hopefully the new earbuds will deserve a much higher rating.,1,1,2019-6-22,1,6,0
"I really hate these and I wish I hadn't missed my return window. I've switched out the rubber ear pieces, but they still do not stay in my ear when jogging. If I put my phone on my left arm, they disconnect and reconnect constantly so I eventually figured out that my phone has to be on the right side at all times, even when I'm using them at home. I spend more time fighting these than actually working out. I can't go as far from them as I can with my other Bluetooth devices and that's annoying. What's also is annoying is all the talking that they do. If I'm on the phone and decide I want to switch to these, the right one has to talk, then the left one, then they talk again when connected to my phone. Just say it once so I can continue my conversation.I also hate that the only thing I can do on them is pause music. My headset let me skip songs while working out and adjust the volume. Haven't seen a function on here for either of those. I bought these because my headset kept getting caught on my hair but honestly that headache was better than this one. They sound good, look cute and work on my wireless charger so two stars I guess.",3,1,2020-4-5,1,5,0
"AMAZON, why would you put this as your choice if the search is ""Earbuds for swimming""????The moment you get in the water, the music stops playing... you have to keep your head above the water for the music to play which is impossible if you are lap swimming.... definitely one of the worst products i have ever bought! Used to have some amazing headphones for swimming but after 7 years of use they stopped working... thought i would give this a try and they are TERRIBLE!! do not buy them if you are thinking about going swimming with them. And please Amazon fix your algorithm for when a person searchs ""Earbuds for swimming""",1,1,2020-1-31,1,8,0
"I bought these, mostly, for doing yard work and being outside. I keep my Galaxy S9+ in my pocket and listen to music. These would constantly lose connection and make it sound like the music was skipping, although I know it wasn't. I couldn't even wear them. I have some Bose Bluetooth headphones that have a wire between them and the never dropped. This is the second pair of $50-$60 ones that I bought and I would not recommend them. I spent $80 and bought the Soundcore Liberty Airs and they seem ok. Haven't mowed the lawn with them yet but they got great reviews on CNET.",1,1,2019-6-25,1,8,0
UPDATEpurchased these earbuds in December 2019 and they are useless the batteries in the case don't hold a charge for more than a day or so when not being used. I will fully charge case and buds throw them in my work bag and 2 days later with no use go to use them and all are dead not a reliable product.,1,1,2019-12-22,1,6,0
"These are my first ""true wireless"" earbuds, so I don't have anything to compare them to. But I have been happy with these. Sound is pretty great. A lot fuller than other similarly priced earbuds I've had in the past. The bass hits a bit heavy for me, but I think most people will like that.I was worried about the fit as I've had trouble in the past. But the standard size ear piece fits perfectly for me. Stays in while working out. Doesn't slip at all. There are 4 sizes to choose from, so you should be good there.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,9,0
"The sound quality and volume of these headphones was good as well as the comfort. However, the Bluetooth strength and battery are awful. I had my phone in my pocket at work and was walking around like the hunch back of Notre Dame trying to avoid it going in and out. Additionally, the battery only lasted like 2 hours. Unless you're a midget or planning on wearing your phone on your arm or something and don't care that it'll last less than 2 hours then spend the extra money on a better pair",2,1,2019-5-28,1,6,0
"I got these so I could use them at work (warehouse job), I only use one of the two earbuds, with the volume at the lowest setting my phone can do (so i am not pumping the volume at all), essentially just background music, so I can still hear what's going on around me or listen to others talking.However even with the volume at near silent levels, these earbuds suffer from piss poor battery life, I literally can only get about 1 to 2 hours of playback before the music stops and i hear ""disconnected"" and the earbud goes dead and wont turn back on. On top of this, over that time, they constantly suffer from random brief spontaneous short cut-outs every 10 minutes or so, even though my phone is in my pocket and on me always (so not a distance or line of sight issue), it doesn't stop the music or whatever, however the audio cuts out for a second or two then resumes, and I am not streaming music, rather playing music off my phone's storage (so isn't an internet connection issue).",1,1,2020-5-26,1,2,0
"If you are like me, and using  these in such a way that you don't have access to the audio source to change volume, or the audio source doesn't have a volume control (i.e. Optical Audio connection from a TV to a bluetooth transmitter),  these are not for you.  My primary use of these headphones was to connect them to a bluetooth transmitter that is connected via optical audio to my TV.  These bluetooth device is just taking raw audio from the TV at full volume.  The TV remote doesn't modify outgoing audio, the bluetooth transmitter has no volume control, and these headphones have no volume control.  This results in an ear-splitting experience.  That said, these are a decent headphone if connected to a mobile phone or PC, and you can access those devices to adjust the volume while you are wearing them.  To the manufacturer, why make something that is wireless and intended to be used while not attached to the audio source, and not include a volume control?  This makes no sense.",2,1,2019-12-6,1,3,0
"I originally bought these wireless buds to use with my Samsung Note 9 (I wouldn't pay more than $60) for wireless buds, because I'll lose them, and the sound quality isn't going to get much better, until we're comparing these and $150 midrange closed-ear wired headphones.Sound Quality:",4,1,2019-3-15,1,5,1
I paid a few bucks extra for blue and the material on the box says blue but I don't see any blue on this. It means that me and the wife keep reaching for each others. This is a me problem.1. They are loud like 50% volume is painful for me but I'm pretty protective of my hearing.,4,1,2020-5-24,1,2,1
"I got these as they were advertised for working out and I needed some for biking. There are a lot of things to like about these for the price - they sound fantastic, they have a few sizing options and they stay in my ear when I sweat. The biggest issue I have with them is that the only controls are pause, play, and accidentally call your mom. I don't think many buying these are wanting to use them for phone calls, and if so they could pull out their phone; Tozo should've given us a skip button instead. I use a long playlist on shuffle when I'm biking and I keep my cell in my backpack, so it is a huge hassle to stop and pull it out just to skip a song I'm not feeling. For that reason these get three stars from me and I'll likely replace them soon.",3,1,2019-10-31,1,4,0
"Everyone else on this page must have gotten entirely different earphones than me. first mine came in a different packaging than the one in the pictures it was white for some reason. The charging doesn’t work my earphones never charge completely the case is charged but the earphones always remain red which is complicated because they have just sat on my desk for a week and now they have no charge, WITHOUT ANYONE YSUNG THEM! And finally they don’t even connect fast at all they connect to each other first which is already slower than normal but then it takes a little less than a minute for them to connect. If anyone wants to tell me why this is happening, or better yet send me a new pair because these ones are useless please contact me.",1,1,2019-5-2,1,9,0
"After trying multiple true wireless headsets in the $30-40 range, I finally came across the Tozo T10s. These are now my daily drivers.Let me tell you the bad first, and it is only 1 thing. You can't skip songs forward or back, which is really strange to me as that is a common feature on even the cheapest of the cheap headsets. But this does not stop me from loving these. See below.",4,1,2019-11-24,1,4,0
Connectivity issues all the time sound quality was extremely cheap the volume wasn't very loud there was like time when you're watching a YouTube video battery life was not good the color white is not good because it gets dirty easily and does not wash off almost like it absorbs the dirt or oil or whatever permanently after putting them in your ear you have to move them just perfect otherwise the sound cuz we're because it blocks your ear canal. I just bought a pair of Jabra Elite active 65t pair of earbuds they're $189 but every penny is well worth it you will hear things you never thought you would the point is you get what you pay for and these earbuds I am giving a rating on as for consumers who don't either have high standards or don't know what they're missing or can't afford anything better either go big or go home the best or nothing especially when it comes to you such a small microscopic piece of technology that you are putting in your ear sometimes you really just can't skimp out on just some words of advice,1,1,2019-10-14,1,5,0
"This is the 3rd Tozo product I have ordered.  I ordered the T6 for my sister at Christmas and the T10 for a friend. I finally got around to ordering myself a pair. I just received my earbuds in the mail and could hardly wait to try them.  I purchased the khaki colored ones cause I have an iPhone Xs in gold. The box and earbuds are true to color. I was surprised because the charger cord that came with it is the same khaki color.  Pairing kinda confused me so if you have difficulty, try this: the earbuds come separately out of the charging case. Place the earbuds in the charging case, then hook the charging case up to the charger cord and use a device to give it power for charging. I let mine sit for a minute. Then, take the earbuds out of the charging case (leave the case on the charger) and place them in your ears.  They will sync together and become pair-able ready. Then go to your bluetooth settings and look for Tozo......... That's it. You only have to click one to power on or off, not both. The sound quality is excellent! Honestly for the price, you can't beat these. I am super pleased!",5,1,2020-2-6,1,4,0
"PROS: These earbuds (air buds?) have surprisingly great bass and sound quality overall, and does a good job at (passively) blocking out external sounds. When it's in my ears snugly (using the extra provided silicone adapters), I don't feel like it's going to fall out. I use it for running and they actually stay in my ears better than my previous bluetooth earbuds that wrap around the auricle. The case able to be charged wirelessly is also a nice touch, which is especially nice considering the flap that covers the microUSB charging port is ridiculously difficult to open.NEUTRAL: Personally, I am not a big fan of the buttons, they require too much pressure to actuate. When I want to pause a song, I have to press so hard on them that it feels like I'm jamming it further into my ear canal. Either that or pinch it with two fingers but that moves the ear buds around and I'd have to readjust them, and so on. I would recommend going for touch-sensitive ones.",2,1,2020-7-26,1,2,0
"Hi, I was walking outdoor in a mall with music on, then my left earbud unfortunately suddenly started to cut the sound and go mute, it seems like a quality issue in product, the product is a few days old, in a full charge and freshly new, but this issue happened and i troubleshooted it in every way possible but it didnt work out.overall, the built material is great, sound quality is fantastic for value. charge seems to holdup to what it say, wireless charging functions well. Sound isolation is average if you try to change to a bigger size bud maybe it will isolate more noise. You must check what suits your ear.",1,1,2019-12-27,1,4,0
"It is obvious why these bids have 35,000 reviews!  I was shocked to see that many yet I kept trying other brands. I own many True Wireless buds and these are among the best I have listened too.  He as the popularity. Once I started them the biggest first impression was the bass.  I listen to audio books so normally don’t notice. However, I honestly have never heard such base.  Companies like Tozo may be Chinese but they sure are keeping the Japanese and American companies on their toes. The American and Japanese brands found in big box stores generally cost $50-$100 more due to the marketing and overhead yet the saavy Amazon shopper who can tell the quality brands like Tozo apart from super generic and sketchy brands, can often find but far more advanced the  90% of the industry. IPX8 offered in these buts. Are you kidding me?  Nothing at Best Buy can handle more then a glancing bead of sweat!  These are the real deal!",5,1,2020-2-16,1,9,1
Base is great! Pretty clear. Similar to a Bose quality sound. Only problem is no matter how I charge it as soon as I take it out it keeps beeping like it’s low in battery when I’m on the phone every few seconds. After a few days it keeps connecting and disconnecting while on the phone. When it comes to important calls it gets really annoying because you won’t hear what the other person is saying. I haven’t read the manual to pin point the problem but in a few days if it gets even worst I’ll return it. Maybe it’s just a faulty one. I’ll still give it another try because the sound quality is pretty darn good!(UPDATE) ok so this is quality review: had it for a few weeks now. After 2 days it started having problems. Kept beeping like it’s low in battery but I’ve left it charging for 2 days! A few days after it started cutting in and out. Disconnecting and connecting randomly. At the beginning or a few times in the conversation. Gets annoying and especially for important calls you won’t hear what they’re saying. I thought it’ll get better in time but it seems to be getting worst. So sad. Sound quality is great but sadly it’s not working properly so I’ll have to return it. I rate it a 1 Star after this experience. If you can’t use it sound quality doesn’t matter.,1,1,2019-10-27,1,5,0
I love these because they stay in your ears! Noise cancellation is excellent too. In fact when I’m driving I have to remove one in case of sirens and what not. For the price they’re worth every Penny. We’ve had them over a month and they’ve been awesome for driving especially because the Bluetooth in my car broke and I wasn’t able to take calls while driving. This fixed the problem instantly!,5,1,2020-2-2,1,3,1
"I ordered this on a whim while walking home from the grocery store with my wife, who had on her own ear buds.  I also was interested in getting some buds/headphones that would be lighter and less obtrusive in the gym.Products used prior to this:  Beats style wireless headphones, wired ear buds, sampled air-pods.",4,1,2020-7-31,1,2,0
"Forget controlling the volume of anything, including when in a call....let alone skip a song in a playlist. There are NO controls over anything but answering and rejecting a call and pausing whatever you are listening to. This soo sucks. The packaging is beautiful, the battery box is really nice with a nice magnetic lid so, in a nutshell, it looks good and smells good on the outside but rotten to the core as far as functionality is concerned on the inside.[UPDATE} Reduced to 1 star because regardless of the little rubber tips I try to use, they will NOT stay in my ears. I will be asking for a refund.",1,1,2020-2-6,1,6,0

"UPDATE 3 like others have said left ear cuts out frequentlyUPDATE 2. So i still haven't figured out completely, because sometimes it does not beep at all when you try and use one, but i found that the beeping does stop after a minute or so.  UPDATE. so i haven't figured it out yet, but sometimes it does allow me to use just one without the constant beeping , so im not sure what im doing but there seems to be a way of using just one.  wish instructions were clear on this matter. ORIGINAL POST so the description does not say, but reviews said that you can use just one, and i would think this would be a pretty basic expectation, but if you just put one in, it continuously beeps trying to connect to the other, or am i just doing something wrong.  let me know and ill change the review",1,1,2019-4-27,1,6,0
"I used these for one day. The booklet in the box said they had a 10m range, which is much greater than other ear buds I've had, so I was really looking forward it.

They have a newer version (for a higher cost) but I would suggest looking for a different brand instead.***Update***",1,1,2019-11-5,1,4,0
UPDATE: Bought in November. It's February now. My bluetooth earpieces won't connect with each other. I'm nineteen and pretty tech savy. I've tried the simple fixes that used to work (disconnecting and reconnecting). I've tried factory resetting but the manual methods don't even work. I've fully charged them. I left them alone for a few days. I've done everything I could possibly think of and these earbuds won't even try to connect to each other.

"TLDR: Too much bass and/or weak treble, and design shortcomings take away a star, but overall a good set of earphones.The sound quality of these earphones are decent, but the low-end either overcomes the high-end, or the earphones just don't produce the high-end well. The overall sound is a little muddy due to this, but if you like bass you probably won't be disappointed.",4,1,2019-2-27,1,5,0
Left would not stay synced with right.  Very disappointed.  I have $30 ear buds that stay synced well with each other and they are also completely binaural.  Makes me think that these are not truly BT 5.0 in both earbuds like they should be.,2,1,2019-4-24,1,9,0
I bought these buds because they were advertised you can swim with them. (see image)  That means swimming with your head above water.  THEY DON'T WORK!  The blue tooth range is less than 5 feet on land so forget about using them in the water.  Not even standing in the pool worked.I tried to return the item and the seller keeps sending me emails on how to use them  INSTEAD OF REFUNDING MY MONEY OR SENDING A PAIR THAT WORKS.  Even their instructions shows you can use them in the pool BUT YOU CANT.  THESE ARE GARBAGE AND THE SELLER IS TOO.,1,1,2020-6-16,1,4,1
Me gusta tienen buena calidad. Nada más falta el detalle de usar el control de volumen ya que todo lo haces desde el celular pero la calidad del sonido es buena.

"Standard for all my reviews: When reviewing products, I always remain objective and honest about the product or service. I always review with information that I feel others would like to know about the product as I always assume what I'm writing will influence for or against the purchase. I always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality, value and application. Most importantly, I will always end the review with an answer as to whether I'd purchase the product again which I believe is the most critical question pertaining to the item. To manufacturers: Want me to review your items, just let me know!These are exactly what I was looking for.  I did a lot of research and wanted to make sure that the earbuds I purchased could be used independently (one at a time) and also had multiple sized umbrellas for my ears.  I've had multiple surgeries on my left hear and the ear canal is much bigger than on my right, not to mention I'm mostly deaf in the left ear.  With both earbuds in I can hear just fine but usually just use my right one.  The wireless charging case is awesome and they are magnetically drawn into the each respective holder to charge.  They seem to hold their charge for a long time and the charging case is said to hold enough power to fully recharge three times.  I haven't seen it run out yet but haven't used them so often where that would be much of an issue.",5,1,2019-10-16,1,7,0
"These earbuds sound really good, and convey your voice well also without a lot of background noise from what I am told. However, a month later and the buds barely hold a charge for more than 1 hour despite the 4 hour timeframe stated in the description. I use the right more than the left and the right no longer holds a charge well, but the left still does outlast the right when taken out of the charger both at the same time.",4,1,2020-3-10,1,5,0
"In mono when I only use the right it works pretty well. The problem occurs when I want to use stereo. Every single time I try going stereo, the signal will just cut out of the left on and off. It’s horrible. On top of that, even when it’s not strobing, the signal sort of pans back and forth between the two earbuds in the oddest way.The frequency response isn’t the worst. If you like your headphones bass heavy, this is good. The battery life is incredible and the build quality actually isn’t bad as far as material goes.",2,1,2019-2-27,1,7,0
I suffer from tinnitus and after riding my motorcycle on the highway for any great distance my tinnitus goes into overdrive after the ride and makes life miserable. I recently purchased these to use while riding my motorcycle on the highway. Went on my first road trip today.The Pros: There are 4 included rubber earpieces included (the medium size is attached by default). Real easy to pair the ear buds with your phone or iPod. The sound on these is incredible! I didn't have to crank the volume for good quality sound while riding.,4,1,2019-10-1,1,3,0
"Unimpressed with the very low battery life (or ability to charge via the “charging case”. Not sure if I’m doing something wrong or not.I keep the case/ battery always plugged in, use the earbuds at night for about 2-3 hours—— then place the earbuds back into the fully charged case. I expect they are both charging at that point...each bud placed carefully in its magnetized spot...and the case plugged in with blinking charge lights.",2,1,2020-2-8,1,3,0
"These earbuds are terrific. They're easy to use, the sound is WAY better than I expected (ESPECIALLY for the money), and the waterproof wireless charging case is pretty much functionally perfect. Bonus: the case is EXTREMELY satisfying to open & close, and to remove the earbuds from & place them back in. The magnetic snaps are nice and strong, but not too resistant when you want to open it and remove the earbuds. You can really feel that the connection is strong enough to protect the electronics if you dropped the case in water.The magnets make such a pleasing click when they connect that it's strangely fun to simply open up the case, take out the earbuds, put them back in again and close it up.  Made me feel like Eeyore with his birthday balloon.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,1,0
"Great product, and great price point. I researched several wireless earbuds, and quickly realized I could spend a lot of money if I wanted to. Ordered these with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. They stayed put in my ears on my run, and the charging/carrying case is nice. I was not concerned about sound quality, but they sound good to me, so bonus on that. My priority was comfort and ease of use during fitness...win, win.UPDATE: R earbud randomly stopped working in Sept 2020, so I emailed the company. They got back to me right away, and even though it was outside the 1-year warranty, they kindly sent me a brand new product! Excellent customer service, and great they they stand behind their product!! Highly recommend. PS...have used these earbuds almost daily, and have been very happy!",5,1,2019-8-7,1,2,1
"I usually use my headphones while jogging and had been using a bluetooth pair that were wired to eachother for quite some time.  They sounded great but the jogging action would cause the cable to rub off my clothes which would be conducted straight to my ears.  So I decided to jump on the bandwagon and get this pair of wirefree headphones.Pros:  The sound is excellent.  The trebles are clear, the bass is rich without being overpowering or murky.  I have had very few problems with signal drops (if I put one earpiece in my rear pocket when talking to someone then the signal may drop out).  Also these seem to stay put in my ears with no problems whatsoever.",3,1,2019-5-2,1,4,0
"I purchased these about 3 months ago and have only used them a handful of times. These earbuds stopped working in the middle of a work meeting which was pretty unfortunate. After playing around with Bluetooth settings for a bit I was able to get the right one working again but the left one is dead in the water.These, unfortunately, did not last long nor were they reliable in a professional setting.",1,1,2020-6-2,1,5,0
"I purchased these to listen to books while I walk on my treadmill. I put them in last night and it was wonderful to block out the rest of the world (my 2 kids fighting and my husband watching youtube.) The sound was fine, it was clear without any crackling but it doesn't seem to be a full 5.0 experience. I have a hard time with earbuds fitting but these were comfortable and seemed stable. I didn't perform any high impact activities so I can't say whether or not they would fall out. They did seem a bit big but I have never owned bluetooth earbuds before. They were very easy to pair (although reading the R & L for charging and wearing is HARD!) The distance worked well for me, also haven't tested too far since I just got these yesterday. The packaging is nice and will work well for a gift. Overall I am happy with this purchase and excited to use these.",5,1,2019-12-13,1,8,1
"""Amazon's Choice"": gives me the impression these are just overstock items that have reached the end of their life.Feels VERY VERY deceptive for them to be labelled as anyone who would recommend these over the other competitors who offer much better quality and over-all value.",1,1,2019-8-24,1,4,0
These have been great! Battery life far exceeds my last Bluetooth pair (that were still wired to a controller).Sound quality has been great. I use these at home during cleaning marathons and will use them for walks when it's nicer out.,5,1,2020-2-22,1,9,0
"For the first 3 months I had these they were great, easily paired with my phone and Chromebook, used them to listen to music at work, take calls, listen to podcasts while walking my dog, and even listen to the news in the shower without bothering my wife.  I also used them when using power tools to protect my hearing.  Over the past few weeks the left earbud would intermittently not charge and I would remove it and replace it several times in the charging case, until yesterday when the left earbud stopped charging entirely.  Don't buy... spend more for better quality",1,1,2019-6-5,1,6,0
"They take wayyyyy too long to auto-connect to my phone. I mean it takes at least 3 minutes! Additionally, the left earbud often intermittently disconnects from the right so the sound in your ear is in and out which is frustrating. I noticed it when I had alerts coming in and ok, fine. But the sound is also interrupted for no discernible reason. Also, it often happens that the left earbud will play music at a different speed than the right earbud. it often plays the music at a faster speed. That is super disorienting.  They fit my ear well and the sound is good, but i can't use them! Don't waste your money. Another pair I bought had similar issues. Maybe the tech isn't good enough yet? Maybe these are too cheap? IDK",1,1,2019-10-1,1,4,0
"I went looking for earbuds to replace my ""over the head"" headphones. After reading the reviews I felt these were my best option for quality and price. I really liked these until half way through my first day of using them. Unfortunately I can't make it through a full work day without them going dead and requiring charging. At that point I have to stop and switch to my over the head ones while they sit and charge. Have been annoyed to come in after a weekend and have them dead and cannot use them. Frustrating.Also, although I can easily connect these to my laptop to listen to music like my other headphones they perform poorly. I can listen to music for a few minutes before the music begins speeding up and slowing down and it become unlistenable. That does not happen when connected to my phone but I do not want to use them connected to my phone as these were to be used via my MacBook Pro.",1,1,2020-6-8,1,3,0
"I bought a wireless earbuds one and half year ago, I really like it but the sound quality still couldn’t compare with the traditional wire headphone. This product provides an amazing sound quality, much faster connecting to my smartphone and the price is much worth with the sound and material quality. I ordered grey color and love it!",5,1,2019-12-7,1,2,1
"I'll start of with cons and leave with pros because I DO like these. Ok, God forbid you walk 5 steps away from your phone or they'll cut out!  Also, they lose signal when I'm using my iPhone for work while I'm using my personal Galaxy for my music.  It gets interfered with easily with that and likely a microwave in Utah.  Also, when I squat it cuts out. I can't go a day without any of these things happening.  Very annoying when it does happen but when all that isn't going on they sound awesome.  You get maybe a few hours and when they get low it's really annoying because she reminds you every 20 seconds that the power is low. Other good things are what people are commonly complaining about an that's the touch controls that you can't touch, you have to press.  I think that's a much better idea because now when I really need to control something I just press.  Touching can be done inadvertantly and happens a lot so I don't listen to those cry babies.  The sound and bass are perfect!  So full and deep.  The calls sound decent.  The charging case is heavy so you know it's made well and it's a good charger.  I'd give these a 3.5 but I can't.  Oh well. Would I order these again if they broke?  Likely.  Price is good and quality is decent enough but the sound is what saves these.  A lot of others in this price range sound lousy.  That's all folks!  Cheers!",3,1,2020-7-29,1,2,0
"I really wanted these to work well. I particularly liked the wireless charging feature of the case - it is very convenient just to drop it on my charging plate. I have no complaints about sound quality, but I typically listen to audiobooks and not music, so I might not be as demanding as others.Unfortunately, these earbuds have a few serious flaws.",2,1,2019-4-6,1,4,0
"Over priced earbuds are only worth it on sale. First off if the connection issues. If my phone is in my pocket and connected to the ear buds at a distance of about 90cm (32in) it will cut in and out. If I use the earbuds on my PC the connection is improved (I can walk more then 10 feet) BUT the earbuds will pause on their own (right then left) causing a skipping in the sound once every 30 mins.The battery life is a joke. I only got about 2 hours per charge, the case has a VERY Small battery and one charge of the earbuds drains half the case. I just noticed that these earbuds will auto-drain the case battery by randomly powering ON in the case, even on flat, still ground. I fully charged the case and buds two days ago, I haven't used them once. Today the case is nearly empty.",2,1,2020-6-17,1,3,0
"Such a common experience these days shopping online compared to in-store.  I received the product and immediately noticed the right-side earpiece would not charge.  At first, I chalked it up to being fully charged compared to the left-side.  I waited until the left-side was fully charged and began using it.  However, after 1 hour of use, I received the voice in the earpiece, ""Battery low"".  That was quick.  So I added them back to the charger.  However, I noticed only the left earpiece would light up orange in charge-mode.  Of course, I checked for debris and dust and tried again for the right-side to charge.  Nothing.  I then swapped the ear pieces into each other's charging spot and the left earpiece would still charge on the right charge socket while the right earpiece remained unlit.  Nothing visually showing me a defect.  The unit will not charge.  And yes...the portable charger was fully charged and also tested while plugged in.  Nothing.  A shame though.  For the price, it was promising.  I give this one star because I am getting tired of these online vendors selling inferior, non-inspected, products, online through Amazon.",1,1,2020-5-8,1,2,0
"I bought these only a year ago and already need to replace them. I am happy with a lot of aspects of the product, but unfortunately I have been having issues with the battery for months. The description says the earbuds can play music for four hours and that the charging case holds an extra 14 hours. I can't confirm that. I have been using the earbuds for about an hour once a week (gym day). After fully charging the case, I would get only two gym visits out of the earbuds before both the earbuds and the case were out of juice. That means that I only got two hours of play time out of these before the battery was completely empty. It seems that the earbuds and the case just lose their charge when they are not being in use; if I let them sit around unused for two weeks, they will lose their charge, even if I don't use them at all. Is that normal? It's pretty annoying. But anyways, even if this is somehow normal, a few days ago, the right earbud just completely stopped charging. I checked the contacts and they aren't dirty or broken, so I assume that something is broken either inside the right earbud or inside the charger case. I was hoping I would get more use out of these than just a year. I did not even use the earbuds that much, and I never used them in the rain or otherwise exposed them to anything that would be a danger to electronics. Disappointed in the durability.Other than that, I liked these earbuds okay. They do not stay in my ears very well, but that is the case for virtually all earbuds I have ever had–must be something with my ears, rather than with the earbuds. They always connected to my phone well, the sound quality was very good, as was the volume and the noise cancellation. So it's really not a bad product other than that it already stopped working and that the case would not hold a charge long enough for my purposes.",3,1,2020-2-13,1,2,0
"Less than a week after receiving these earbuds, the left earbud stopped working. The behavior of the LED light does not mention anything in the instruction manual: it flashes purple non-stop until the battery presumably dies, at which point I can't turn it on. Even after leaving them in a fully charged case for 12 hours, I am unable to turn on the left earbud, let alone have it connect to the right one. Overall, I am very disappointed with this product. The only option they give you is to reset the device: too bad I can't do that if the device won't even turn on!Also, the earbuds fall out all the time and do not stay in the ears. I had to purchase memory foam earbud tips to make the earbuds stay in longer. If you are buying this product, expect to buy your own earbud tips!",1,1,2019-10-23,1,5,0
"I bought these for myself so I can go for a power walk, go to the store, or pittle around the house while I listen to music or books without wires to slow me down. God gave me teeny tiny ears so the Apple earbuds never work for me. I wanted something that would be low visibility as to not shout to the world “I have earbuds in my ear, leave me alone!”.  So I went with the gold pair, thinking they would blend nicely with my medium tan skin and blonde hair. That was a mistake.The gold pair is not as gold as they look in the photo. The only way I know how to describe them is “pantyhose tan”. The only gold  part is the top outer surface where they are labeled R and L. Every other surface is this flesh color, and when I put them in, instead of blending in, it looks like I have major keloids coming out of my ears. Not the look I was going for. Now I wish I had just gone with black, so I can shout to the world, “These are just my earbuds, not huge keloids!”",4,1,2020-1-9,1,3,0
"Updated 3 months after purchase: Buds started to drop Bluetooth connection. When I contacted them for support, they offered to send me a new pair. Great service!Sound quality is pretty excellent, both playing music and for phone calls. Sound quality is the best I've found in several cheap earbuds. Bluetooth connectivity is pretty good. I wish the batteries lasted a little longer but if I put them in the charger for a few minutes they charge quickly.",5,1,2020-7-3,1,2,0

"UPDATE: After 7 weeks and using them 2-3 times a week they no longer charge. They don't charge on the wireless pad or connected to a cord and I have tried 2 wireless pads and 5 different cords. Not sure if this is an isolated incident or not but I am waiting to hear back from Amazon and/or Tozo on how they are going to fix them.  Dead headphones arent very useful.I needed something small and something that would sound good while I worked (painting and general house repairs) and while I am at my computer working. These seem to work well for both tasks. I just got them and haven't had a ton of time using them but the sound quality, which is the biggest thing for me, is amazing. The charging time and battery life are still being discovered but I used them for about two hours yesterday and never had an issue. Noise cancellation is pretty good, moisture wicking was sort of average. I didn't want to drop $150 on airpods or the Samsung model so for $50 these were worth every penny!",1,1,2019-9-16,1,3,0
"I’m sorry I can’t sit by and see these be the most highly rated after suffering with these for so long. I began my search for a new pair of earbuds just now and encountered this problematic pair as the top result. I bought these in December of 2018 and essentially gave up on them.Firstly battery, the battery life is less than 3 hours, on top of that they don’t charge properly on the ports, either it doesn’t charge one earbud at all despite it being in properly, or it will leave one with drastically less charge than the other despite leaving them there until “fully charged”. What makes this annoying is that now you must sit through having the device beep at an obscenely loud volume and yell in your ear that it’s low battery every 5 seconds until it shuts off, that’s totally unnecessary.",1,1,2020-6-28,1,2,0
"I bought a pair of wireless ear buds from Amazon about 6 months ago. They were good and I liked them but I gave them to my wife when she started her new job and found she could listen to music at work. So I went to order the exact same pair but they were out of stock. After searching I found these and since the reviews were mostly positive I ordered them. To my surprise they actually sound better than my original pair that I gave away. They were about the same price so I was expecting the quality to be similar. These sound great and the batter life is about 4hrs which is acceptable for me because I never use them for more than a couple hrs. I have only 2 complaints and they're both minor. First, my original pair had skip functions for music so u can skip tracks without pulling your phone out. This pair doesn't have any phone control other than play music, pause, answer calls, and redial last number. Play and pause is expected but no volume control or track skip. Minor complaint. My second minor gripe is the size of the charging case is bigger than my original pair. Slightly too big for pockets although they make up for it by including a strap for wearing the charging case around your neck like a necklace. Not the most ideal way to carry but its better than trying to pocket such a hefty little case. I would recommend these to anyone looking for good sounding earbuds on a budget",4,1,2020-5-4,1,2,0

"Not very pleased with these, and am thinking about seeing about a refund if it isn't too late. The sound is okay, when they work properly. Synching is easy, once they work properly.Had a hard time getting them to synch, and when I did they were fine. For a couple days. After that, they had to be synched again. I only have them synched to one device, so I see no reason why I would have to keep doing it over and over. They sit right next to it every day, and are never more than five feet apart. But yet every couple days I have to synch them together again. Frustrating to say the least.",2,1,2019-8-8,1,3,0
"I like everything about these earbuds (for the price), except for one thing:  they do not turn off automatically when placed in the charging case.  This causes a few problems, but the biggest is that they keep reconnecting to my phone...even when the phone is already connected to another bluetooth device.  This usually happens in my car.  I'll be listening to a podcast from my iPhone through the car speakers via Bluetooth, then the sound will cut out.  I'll check the phone and find that the earbuds, which are in the charging case and which I haven't touched, have reconnected to the phone.  I've tried turning the earbuds off (pressing one for three seconds) and switching Bluetooth connection in the phone/app.  But then at some random time the buds will reconnect.The problem also occurs when I use the phone (by itself, without ear buds) or even when I try to send an Animoji.  I'll get no sound from the phone and see that it's bluetooth connected to my earbuds, which are sitting in the case....sometimes untouched for hours.",2,1,2020-2-11,1,2,0
I never leave the house without these on my person. Hands down the best quality wireless earbuds that produce amazing sound and are also waterproof. I take baths with them on and submerge my head under water and they still work. I also own Apple AirPods and prefer these earbuds over Apple product. The only complaint I have is that they aren’t great for using for talking on the phone. People complain that they can’t hear me when I use them. They’re best suited for using for music and watching movies or videos on your phone or tablet. I’ve also used them for noise cancellation and they work great.I rarely ever have to charge them bc the case provides an internal battery which keeps them charged for days.,5,1,2019-11-21,1,2,1
"At lowest volume still too loud. When I try to lower the volume, the sound goes completely off. There’s loud and louder, no soft quiet listening. I’m disappointed as I wanted wireless and quiet while listening to music during rest. Sound is crisp and clear with nice bass tones. I do like the sound during the day, but as I’ve already mentioned, they are too loud to be able to rest with music at the lowest volume setting. Plus, if you are wearing the ear buds while connecting to bluetooth, the volume will max out and sound blast your ears -that’s not mentioned at all in the instructions and I find that a bit dangerous for the inner ear hearing. If you wear glasses while wearing these, the blue flashing light reflected is rather irksome. Would have given 4 stars if they could be turned down; 5 if the there wasn’t a constant flashing light.",2,1,2019-10-9,1,3,0
"I love how small these are!This is the first time that I’m using Bluetooth earbuds that don’t have a wire or collar hanging around your neck.

"Long story short: I got these as a present, my dog took them, I ordered a replacement. So this review is about the ""gift"" pair my dog ran off with. If you want a good story continue reading. This item is awesome and does exactly what it is described to.So, I got a pair of these given to me for Christmas. They sound great. However, my dog likes to steal things and take them outside. When I took the ear buds out of my ears to charge I set down the charging case to put my earbuds back in, I looked away for a few seconds, went to pick it back up to put the buds in and it was GONE. I tore the house apart for days, looked as best as I could in the long grass outside but it was nowhere to be found. This was the first week of February. Yesterday March 9th 2020 my husband came in the house holding a muddy and soaking wet mess of the case. It was found submerged in a puddle of mud and water next to the fence, it had been there for the last month and a half, i just couldn't see them. I wiped the outside off, opened the case and cleaned it out. The moment I set the buds on there it lit up to charge them!!!! I did a full charge and they are just as good as they were from day 1. Just a few bite marks on the case lol. The ""dog at my homework"" situation is pretty funny. In all seriousness though, I will order more for gifts etc. Thank you tozo for a product that does what is is described...in this case WATERPROOF!!",5,1,2020-3-9,1,2,0
I was excited to receive these however was extremely disappointed once I received them. Shipping was really fast. Pairing was easy enough although I had to reset them per the instructions because only the right one was pairing up. The push button controls simply do not work with the exception of the volume up only function. I had great expectations from this product based on the reviews so I purchased two sets and have not tried out the second pair yet but will most likely return both of them. I have reached out to company during the extended warranty registration process and hopefully they will respond to me. Perhaps I received a bad set. I will update my review after trying out the second set I purchased and hopefully the company will make things right otherwise I cannot endorse this product.,1,1,2020-6-10,1,3,0
"These are overall great headphones for my needs.  They clearly state when you turn them off and on and when they are paired.  The lights are helpful, also, to know when they are on and when they are charging.  The charging box has lights to tell you the battery level left in it. They stay in my ears for running.  I frequently run with only one because they are so noise cancelling, I can’t hear traffic, other people, birds, etc.  You need to turn both of them on first before taking one out, otherwise it beeps at you to let you know that you are missing one.  That one needs to stay within range also or again, it will beep at you.  Connects flawlessly to my Apple Watch.  My one complaint is that the range is only about 2 feet.  That is fine for running/connecting to my watch, but doesn’t work so well (at all) when I’m on the treadmill and want to connect to my TV across the room.  Also, if I put my watch hand behind my back when running-even for a second-it starts to lose connection.  That is a pretty short range!  Overall happy with them and they stay in way better than AirPods.",4,1,2019-5-8,1,3,0
"Bought these about 4 months ago, wanted to wait to leave a review until after I had enough time to give them a good eval. They were great in the beginning. Excellent sound quality/bass and comfortable to wear. Only used them a few times a week and now they are completely useless as the left earbud refuses to reset/resync with the right. I've looked up all the other complaints/workarounds for resetting and they continue to not work or have any effect. The right earbud will reset fine per the instructions but the left still refuses to and now I cannot use them at all. Extremely disappointed, but when considering the price as a comparison to Apple's new EarPods I suppose it really comes down to you get what you pay for. I was hoping they'd at least last more than a year...my mistake for going with the cheaper option.",1,1,2020-2-8,1,3,0
"I’ll first say that the sound quality is good and they connect with Bluetooth very easily. That being said, the battery life is absolutely terrible! The longest I’ve gotten to use them is 3 hours and the shortest is 5 minutes. I charged the box they are stored in and when it indicated it had a full charge I took them out to listen to something on my iPhone and 5 minutes later it told me the battery was low 3 times and they shut down. I feel terrible because I bought a second one when I got mine and sent it to my son for Xmas. I also have Soundpeats earbuds and they last 7 hours consistently. I’ll stick to using only those and wish I wouldn’t have wasted my money on the Tozo T10.",1,1,2020-1-25,1,3,0
"UPDATE #3: 4 stars. Tozo contacted me and offered a $40 Amazon gift card or a set of T6 earbuds. I wanted to give theyn another shot, so I requested the T6s, and I gotta say, those are pretty awesome. Bettery life, sound quality, and comfort are better. They're also waterproof and have touch sensitive controls instead of physical buttons. For just a few bucks more, the T6 series is far better than the T10. I'm happy that Tozo is willing to work with their customers, too. Not a bad company. Go with the T6 series, though, for sure.UPDATE #2: 1 star. Bad pair of headphones. Now the left one won't even connect unless the right one is connected. As soon as I put the right one back in the case, the left one disconnects and never reconnects. Definitely retuning them and just getting better headphones.",4,1,2020-3-30,1,2,0
"These are so bad. I wanted to return them- but honestly forgot till the time ran out- which is on me- not them- they’re pretty laced about the return policy. But yeah- I like the people - hate the product. But, maybe I just got a bad pair. Since they’re so chill- maybe worth trying it.And also, one stopped working after two weeks. They fall out a lot. They look gross in your ear- like bulky. Sound was actually pretty good tbh- but short lived.",1,1,2020-6-14,1,3,0
"I’ve been waiting for a new company to finish crowdfunding some sweet wireless earbuds, but I got too impatient. I picked these because price and product seemed very similar to multiple products getting great reviews. They aren’t very expensive so I was mainly worried I’d get what I paid for. I’m cautious spending too much on pirated tech since it’s usually inferior. These earbuds are very adequate but are far from being great. They pair first to each other, then they pair to my device. A pleasant voice tells me what’s happening, but to hear it you have to get them in your ears fast. The startup happens when you remove the buds from the charging/storage case. The pairing occurs when I’m putting them in my ears and getting the fit as comfortable as I can. I have a small head with similar ear canals. I’m using the small flanges that fit the ear well, but doesn’t provide a lot of surface to counter balance the weight of the bud. With the battery and tech, they have some weight to them. I went on a 1 1/2 mile walk on a dirt road wearing these. I adjusted each side about three times to shift the weight, find comfort, and once to stop it from rubbing the same spot. They may get more comfortable once I figure out their sweet spot. They do a great job blocking external noises because of the fit. I didn’t hear whistling wind from my brisk walk. The sound is adequate but not high quality. The range just flat out sucks with these. I had a pair of shorts with a cell phone pocket by the right knee pit. I’m not tall so it’s not too far from my ears. I would get no noise from one ear, the other, or both just walking. When I moved the phone to my front hip pocket I was able to get a good connection. I had to do nothing more than move the phone from one spot to the other, the earbuds did all the rest to get me listening again. If I did not have to tether the phone so close to the buds I would like them better. I’m hoping technology improves quickly so that our bodies don’t interfere with the signals, but until it’s affordable and effective, I’ll use these.",4,1,2019-2-23,1,2,0
I had previously purchased another set from another brand to compare sound quality with this set. Here is the good and bad.The Good: Build quality is good. Headsets connect automatically. Case is very nice. Charging lights are bright enough to see through case. Sound quality is phenomenal. Blows away the other set I purchased to compare this one to. Very impressive Base. Did not expect it.,2,1,2019-12-4,1,2,0
"I wanted to truly like these buds but I can't.The good: I've designed truly high end audio equipment for a living and was initially pleasantly surprised. It comes in a nice box, are kept in a nice case that keeps them safe and charged. The sound is actually quite decent for a cheap set of buds. It is a bit bass heavy for me but some people like that sort of thing and, with some additional EQ software, whatever you listen to can be made sound the way you like it. It seems to have decent range and stage, as much as one can speak of that with ear buds.",1,1,2020-3-29,1,1,0
"Probably the best $50 I have spent in a very long time. I have an affinity for quality headphones (Bose QC, audio technica) and I find myself reaching out for these over my over-the-ear phones because of convenience and comfort. Sound quality is incredible for what they are, I just love how crisp the bass is. I use these for running and mountain biking, and they stay in my ears even in the fastest of downhill runs. After coming home, I leave them in while showering.I've shown them off to curious coworkers and friends, and all of them wound up buying a pair! If these broke today, I'd buy another set in a heartbeat. But I'm not worried about that, even after a couple of drops they have shown no signs of stopping.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,2,0
So this is my third pair of these. I lose them a lot. So I bought 2 and brought one to work. Long story short...- These are a cheap knockoff of what I originally bought. I was wondering why this was 10 bucks cheaper,4,1,2020-7-10,1,1,0
"Update: 5/10/2020- This company has EXCELLENT customer service. Upon reading my review, i was contacted by a company rep concerned with my satisfaction with my purchase. They feared i may have a defective product and promptly sent me replacement earbuds of their most current model. I have tried them out and love them. Sound quality is excellent and they have a sleeker profile and lightweight feel. Due to the current pandemic, I’ve been unable to test them in the same environment that caused my previous issue (outside in a crowded city with people everywhere), but i anticipate it being a non issue. At any rate, you can’t beat the customer service. So it gets five stars regardless. But seriously, the sound quality is really good (better than the standard Apple earbuds)!Original Post: I got these to replace my Apple ear buds that died on me. I wear ear buds EVERYDAY for my commute and wanted something that would be durable and provide high quality sound. The sound on these is great! My only issue is they lose connection whenever I’m outside. I live in a large city (Chicago) and when walking from the train to my office, my connection goes in and out - due to what I can only believe is interference from other Bluetooth signals. I never had this issue with my Apple ear buds. I have an iPhone, so I’m not sure if that’s why this is happening. Again, it only happens when I’m outdoors. On the train or in a building, however, they work fine. I wish I didn’t have this issue, otherwise I would give 5 stars",5,1,2020-4-18,1,1,0
"UPDATED REVIEW (AFTER USING FOR ABOUT AN HOUR): NOPE! I spoke way too soon when I rated these! They suck! Sound constantly cuts in and out like it's getting waves of Bluetooth. They literally worked about 15 minutes then started dropping connection. Tried on another device, same issue! Is it really that complicated to make a decent pair of waterproof Bluetooth earbuds that don't cost hundreds? Apparently not! As for the high rating on Amazon, it's got to be paid reviews! There is no way that many people got these to work! NO WAY! Oh, and their website...yeah, doesn't exist! Time to try someone else. Sending these back ASAP!Original review (a few minutes out of the box): These sound great, especially the bass. Much more than expected from such a small speaker. They fit comfortably in my ears and feel very secure. Setup is super simple. Had them paired with my phone within a couple of minutes of opening the box. I can't speak for the battery life or waterproof ability as of yet but my initial impression is very positive. Will update with any issues.",1,1,2020-7-16,1,1,0
"For such a highly rated product I am thoroughly disappointed with the dual earbud sync quality. The problem appears to be that when using both earbuds, in reality, only the right earbud is connected and the left earbud is either piggy-backing off of a signal from the right earbud or tapping into the same signal sent to the right earbud or something else entirely (I'm not a Bluetooth technology engineer). Regardless of how these are operating the issue is that left earbud goes silent for 1-3secs whenever you move your arms or your head in a way that may interfere with the signal (meanwhile the right earbud remains well connected). This makes it a terrible earbud set for working out as you will invariably be flailing your arms or moving your head in some way to exercise. I find that I can't even do common desk work tasks as any movement from my head will cause the left earbud to go silent.  Most earbuds I have purchased do not suffer from the same issue (and fun fact, they all have the same silly female voice to announce initial connectivity/pairing).The small redeeming factor is that these appear to be a better construction and material quality than most off-brand earbuds. They are also quite loud, I find I do not need more than 10-30% volume delivery from my phone compared to most other earbud devices I use needing 80-100%.",1,1,2020-4-2,1,1,0
"Earlier I'd given the T10's a 3 out of 5 stars because the ear bud didn't stay synchronized and they don't stay in the ear. The vendor was not happy with my review and offered multiple options to get me to take the review down. They offered a gift card, and a newer set of upgraded earbuds, the T06 stating that the T10 I had may have been defective. They practically begged me to take the poor review down because their goal is 100% satisfaction and 100% positive reviews.I opted to try the new T06 and advised them that I'd give a fair review and may considered removing the negative review IF the replacement upgraded ones were good. Here is my update:",2,1,2020-6-25,1,1,0
"I got this for running - specifically, running (or walking) for long periods of time.  It takes me forever to complete a half-marathon, so I want something that will give me at least 4 hours of battery life (warm-ups, post race, etc.).  I used this for several shorter runs - all about 4-6 miles.  Good sound - had one bud pop out once, but caught it on the fly and popped it back in.  Last Saturday, I went for a 10 mile walk (not run) which took me through the woods.  Unfortunately, after exactly 2 hours and 36 minutes, I got a warning that the battery was low.  Three warnings and it cut off.  (Yes, I had fully charged it the day before.)  So, I'll still be looking for something better.  If you only need a continuous charge of a couple of hours, this should work.",2,1,2020-2-25,1,2,0
"These bluetooth earbuds are a very good product -- for the price point, I'd say excellent.  I found a handy workaround for my one significant complaint: you can listen for an hour or so, and then you have to charge for a while (from the case's big battery to the earbud's small battery) before you can keep listening.  I found this annoying for when outdoors doing yard work for several hours.  My workaround is to buy TWO PAIRS.  I set aside the left earbud from each pair, and I use only the right earbud from each pair.  I keep them together in one little case.  When my first ""R"" earbud's battery drains, I put it into the case and I switch to the second ""R"" earbud.  I can ping-pong back and forth this way for 4 or 5 hours.  (If I were willing to carry both cases in my pocket, I could use two whole pairs, but I prefer to carry around only one case.)If I could change one feature of this earbud, I would allow allow one to use ""L"" only in the same way as one can use ""R"" only.  Then my ping-pong trick would work without buying a second pair.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,1,0
"PAIRS Fast, Great signal reach,  Great sound - For the price hard to beat, much better than some of the more expensive wireless earbuds. I owned a pair of Tozo 6 's which impressed me a lot. Over the weekend some how I lost one of the units - fell out of my pocket.  I was so bummed because these were really wonderful for my everyday use - they performed and sounded so well. I searched to no avail - hoping a discovery at the lost and found counters of places I had visited.  I ordered the 10's and  ... they sound even better than the 6's and still had great battery life and signal reach.  This is a very great product & brand. AND you can afford them!",5,1,2020-6-1,1,2,0
"I am lowering my rating to 1 star. Why? The company continues try to bribe me to raise my rating by emailing to my PRIVATE Amazon email address: Here is their email text, which includes a $40 Amazon gift certificate:""This is Jamie from TOZO. After checking, we know that you are not 100% satisfied with the earbuds, what you received maybe a defective item.",1,1,2020-5-7,1,1,0
"These were cheaper MSRP than the ones I returned, same price with sale.  Sound is better, fit is better, battery life is better. CONS: uses buttons instead of touch, but that is actually a pro because it is more reliable. No volume or skip, but again, for this price, I need something that works and is reliable. Throw in the wireless charging and waterproof, and I'm hoping these are the wonder budget headphones (100th attempt) I've been looking for... we'll see.And we saw. Cuts out a lot in the left ear. Way too much to truly enjoy on a 1 mile run, let alone a 30 miler. Bummer, doesn't happen just sitting, only when running.... :( To return or not to return. That is the question.",1,1,2020-5-23,1,1,0
"very very disappointed. The reviews indicated a lot of positive ls here but everything about these disappointed.Waterproof is not true. Only splash resistant. Since they fall out so easily, a splash would do them in.",1,1,2020-6-21,1,1,0
"Update: Tozo Customer contacted me for a replacement. Highly recommend and appreciate the customer support.I've had these for a little over a year. I liked them so much in the beginning that I purchased 3 other pairs for family members. They have been my daily earbuds I use. They worked well and the sound quality was adequate. Voice calls were horrible because people can not hear you well but I didn't purchase these for voice calls. Now, a couple months after the 1 year mark, the batteries in the earbuds have degraded down to 30 minutes or less. Just in case anyone was wondering, the warranty on these are 1 year. It is not stated on the product listing and only says lifetime support in the warranty section. I contacted Tozo and they said the warranty is 1 year so I was out of luck. Luckily, I purchased the square trade warranty on these and will receive a check for 95% of my original price I paid. I would have expected the battery life to be better on these but you get what you pay for. I will try the Tozo T6 next, of course with the additional warranty again.",5,1,2020-3-26,1,2,0
"I got a pair of these and left a bad review because the sound quality on the high end of the spectrum was crunchy and harsh. That's still true, but the seller reached out to me via email and offered to send me a pair of their next tier earbuds, the T6s for free without even having to return the first pair. If you're looking for a pair of budget wireless earbuds, I'd recommend the T6s (only $10 more). They have much better sound quality, are waterproof with a wireless charging case, and have more controls via touch instead of physical buttons. You can pause, volume up/down (although this is a little slow because you have to touch and hold and it takes a few seconds), accept and reject calls, etc. The bass is also very good if you switch to the correct rubbers (for lack of a better term) - I would recommend a little bigger than you think, so they fit more snugly in your ears, and it really brings the bass up. The bluetooth connection is still a bit annoying in that you can't connect to them while they're connected to another device but I can get forgive that for the other features.TOZO T6:",4,1,2020-6-10,1,3,0
"Previously I've tried the Bose SoundSport (my wife's), and I decided to try the Tozo T10. I ended up returning them in favor of the Sony WF-1000XM3.The Tozo ones just didn't have good enough sound for me to tolerate, even though they were really comfortable and fit well in my ear.",4,1,2020-2-5,1,2,0
"Second review of this item. After returning (and refund) the first pair for being defective, I was contacted by the company to try and make it right. They offered an additional credit to use on Amazon or a new pair of the Tozo T10. I had really wanted to give them a fair chance so I chose to have a new pair sent and give them a new review. This effort on the company's part to stand by their products and reach out to customers to make sure they are satisfied is a great testiment to the confidence in the products and their exemplary customer service.The Tozo T10 Bluetooth 5.0 wireless earbuds come in a sturdy charging and on the go carrying case. The earbuds are light weight and comfortable. I chose this particular pair of earbuds because they have a higher waterproof rating. I sweat perfusely when I workout and especially when I run. The Tozo T10 seem to hold up well with out any problems. The battery life is good and there were no problems with that and they synced up very easily and importantly, kept the sync. The Tozo T10 has good crisp sound quality from the lower bass sound to the higher end trebles. The only thing I had any issue with was the sound volume wasn't loud enough. I like to emerse myself in my music when I workout and if your in an outside city or busy gym environment your going to hear a lot of surrounding noise. I tried using other ear cap sizes but it didn't change anything except for the comfort. Others had great reviews of the noise cancellation but for me it was average....3 stars.",4,1,2020-5-29,1,2,0
"Got the TOZO T10 yesterday, very excited about it. Unfortunately my first impression is that it does not stay in the ear, easily fall off, spent a couple hours trying different ear caps and watched youtube videos, no luck. Will have to return it. Sound quality seemed good though but there was no point trying it all out. Unfortunate.",1,1,2019-1-21,1,9,0
"For work, I am a dish washer at a restaurant, which means not a lot of time to mess around with earphones or the dishes will pile up. Luckily these earphones pair with my iPhone very quickly as soon as I take them out of the case they say “connected” and connect automatically. Washing dishes can be very chaotic, and music helps me to focus. These earphones are great because they are water resistant, and they have no wires so the wires don’t tug and pull out my earphones as I move around. Secondly, the earphones are great because they stay in my ear. Once I took out the little plugs for them, they stay in my ear as I move around. I look down a lot to scrub dishes, and so it is important the earphones stay in my ear, and they do without the plugs. Lastly, the sounds is good and the battery lasts my long grueling 8 hour shifts. What more could you ask for? Rock on!",5,1,2020-3-3,1,2,0
"I must have the weirdest ear canal size on the planet.Usually none of the extra earbud covers fit both ears snuggly, no matter the size. But for these, the default covers that came on the earbuds fit perfectly!  They also give you other sizes if you need them.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
"I got these so I could wear them under ear-muff style hearing protection.  My basis for comparison is a similarly priced pair that is similar in style to the Apple product, so I don't know if that's the cause of some of the differences I'm seeing.Range: the range is horrible for BlueTooth 5.0.  That may be due to the form factor; there just isn't much room for an antenna.  I can't get more than 10 feet from them without issues, and if any object is in between my phone and the earbuds it's hopeless.  My other pair easily does 75 feet or so, and a wall isn't an issue.  I have to keep my phone in my pocket to use these.",2,1,2020-1-1,1,2,0
"EDIT -- After I submitted the original review from below, I got an email from TOZO asking me about the product. They determined that I was probably sent a defective product on accident. They profusely apologized about the incident. They even offered to replace my headphones free of charge for a pair that was more expensive than the ones I originally bought. I appreciate that TOZO took the time out to contact me and try to make it right. Thank you.I almost never write reviews for things I buy from amazon. But I am so annoyed with these headphones that I have to let people know about my experience. So at first, I loved these headphones, they have good bass and even at half volume, it was loud enough for me. But the Bluetooth on these is absolute trash. If you plan on staying still and using these headphones, you will have no problem. But if you are like me and plan on doing things with these headphones (walking, bending down, basically any movement) these are NOT the headphones for you. Every time I move a certain way, the headphones will go like it lost the signal to my phone. It doesn't last long and gets the signal back almost immediately. But it's beyond frustrating when every few seconds the sound dips out and comes back in. I was shoveling for maybe 10 minutes and the sound dipped at least 30 times even though my phone was in my coat pocket, as close to the headphones as they could be. Besides that Bluetooth issue, the charging case is another issue. Even when the headphones are fully charged, they continually pull power from the case. So my case dies every other day or so, even if I haven't used the headphones, my case will still die because its constantly charging, even when its fully charged. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.",4,1,2020-3-26,1,3,0
"These earbuds are a decent set for a reasonable price. They are easy to sync, easy to use, comfortable, and the battery life is fine for my purposes. They're fine for listening to music or podcasts, but the audio does not quite sync with video, with the sound being a half-second or so behind the video. I have other wireless audio accessories that do not have this issue.UPDATE: After my initial three-star review I was contacted by TOZO, who offered me either an Amazon gift card for the value of the purchase or the newer version (T6) as a replacement. I opted for the replacement. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived in just three days. I'm quite pleased with the communication and service I've gotten from the seller, and I've left positive feedback for them. I won't change the star rating because my original review describes my issues with the product.",3,1,2020-3-30,1,2,0
"I am very pleased with my purchase! The earbuds were ready to use right out of the box. The packaging was very professional looking. The instructions were easy to follow. The only thing that I didn't like was the terminology used in the instructions. It referred to the right earbuds as MASTER and the left earbuds as SLAVE. It made me really uncomfortable at first and I considered sending them back. I decided to keep them because I think that it was not meant to be offensive, even though it is. Instead, I will just address it in my review. I gave this review 5 stars because the product is 5 star quality, so far. The customer service has been 5 star quality as well. I recommend these earbuds BUT I also recommend the company considering removing the power designations in the future.Update: After a few months, one of the earbuds stopped working. I had registered the product so I emailed the company like the instructions said. I never heard back from them. The review has been updated to reflect the purchase with 6 months of buying it.",1,1,2019-7-29,1,2,0

The Tozo T10s were just what I needed! Great battery life, good sound quality, and ergonomic design!

"Terrible product. I’ve ordered about 4 of the earbud type devices, returned them all, and wish now I’d stuck w/ the first pair I got. Ironically I waited too late to return these but that’s on me.Don’t know if they’re used or just bad but they don’t want to pair w/ my phone in a timely manner and then, when they finally do, only one. The right one does most of the time but the left one doesn’t. They always and I mean ALWAYS pair individually. The poor directions provided don’t help much either. Even after pairing the volume on left one must be adjusted every single pairing while the right one is always fine. The fit is difficult as well. I never have a problem with fitting anything into my ear other than my elbow but I’ve tried all of the supplied nipples and none fit comfortably, repeat, none fit comfortably. They’re OK if you ever do get them both to sync but only OK., not great, not worth the hassle. I will say this tho, the skin tone color is nicer than the white or black one usually sees. If I could I’d give these half a star just because of the syncing/pairing issues. It’s a drag, man. Too much effort every single time negates any enjoyment or ease of movement they potentially provide.",1,1,2020-2-19,1,2,0
I I liked it at first when I was using it daily but then I found out that they died on their own yes I am turning them off and while they're sitting in the case off they die recharge from the case and then died again draining the case so over a week's time not only they die but the case dies also not connected to any device or anything complete trash I will say I guess it's okay if you use it daily but if you let it sit it will die there's no way around it so for that I give it one star I would return it if I could and the only reason I found this out it's because covid-19 closed the gyms.,1,1,2020-4-14,1,3,0
"**I added a star because the vendor is truly concerned about their customers, and I've gotten more comfortable with these earbuds, and have found that I enjoy them even more. Other than their weight/size maybe not being ideal for all ears, these are probably the best reasonably priced earbuds I've found.These earbuds are well made and the charging box has plenty of oomph to keep things going throughout a long day. The ear buds have excellent battery life and good range, and certainly more than 30ft, in my experience. But I suppose that would vary depending on the environment. They are a bit on the heavy side but can lock reasonably well in the ear. Sound is also very powerful, but this is also an issue with my setup. The problem is that my iPhone7S can't reduce the volume to a point that I'm always happy with; some music is good but others I'd like to turn-down the volume and the lowest setting just isn't low enough for my taste -- If you like loud music these are definitely good though. Sound quality is good too, but maybe just a bit heavy on the bass. Again a personal preference. Sound cancelling is good, but because I can't find a volume that's always comfortable, I end-up not seating them as securely in my ears so I do lose some of that benefit, plus they're more likely to fall out then. Can't really blame the construction or function for this, because I'm not really using them properly. The more major issue, for music, is that I like to be able to do more than pause songs, I like to be able to skip songs and change volume from the ear buds, and that's not supported; you can only pause on them, so you have to keep your device available to perform those functions. Lastly, both earbuds pair with themselves very reliably, but I manually have to select them under Bluetooth devices to connect them to my iPhone7S. They always go into pairing mode but don't auto-connect like my other earbuds. Overall, they're high quality earbuds with a few operational issues, but they have the most powerful sound of any that I've used to date.",5,1,2019-8-29,1,2,0
"The product has good sound Quality and relatively good bass for the price point. The charging has never been an issue for me and I have worked  out walked around campus (college) with these on. I will say I was sent a slightly alarming email that seemed like spam with highlighted words, and a lot of pressuring language to give a 5 star review in exchange for a wireless charger. I still would like the charger but I also know that a reputable company would not create false positive reviews in exchange for a free wireless charger so I expect to see mine in the mail regardless of me not giving them a 5 star review.

Nothing I have done has worked to get the left earbud (the slave earbud) to connect to the right again.

"I purchased the TOZO T10 bluetooth earbuds to use for going on walks or exercising.  I found pretty quickly that if my phone (OnePlus 6) is in my pocket or if it's just not within a foot or so of the earbuds, the sound will cut out every couple of seconds.  They don't fully disconnect, but the sound keeps dropping out, and it bounces between being in stereo and mono.  I have 2 other pairs of earbuds that work perfectly fine on this phone, so I know it's not the phone having issues.  The only way I could keep the sound from going out was to hold the phone at about shoulder height while I was walking, which I can't do with all exercises.In addition, the charging case seems to lose its charge quickly.  I charged the case and earbuds for the afternoon when I first got them, and I've only used them for about 2 hours total, and yet the case has gone from 4 lights to 1 light in that time.  I thought perhaps that the earbuds were draining the battery because I had to manually make sure the earbuds were off before charging them, but if I leave them on and put them into the case, and then pull them out again a few seconds later, I hear them saying ""Power on"".  So it sounds like they power off on their own, but I'm not sure why the case will barely charge them once.",2,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0
"I really enjoy these earbuds. I had purchased the Bose Soundsport Free earbuds and I ended up returning them because they had hurt my ears. I purchased these TOZO T10 earbuds and they are a game changer. They have really good sound quality and an extreme amount of bass. I absolutely love bass, I had three subwoofers in my previous vehicle, and I still had to turn the bass down with an equalizer on my phone. They are wicked ""bassy"". I washed my truck with them in and got water on them and theyre fine. I wouldn't go submerging them, but getting water/sweat on them is no big deal. They work great.I do wish that the sound went a little louder, and the bass wasnt as intense. I think the bass overcompensates the sound. If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that are truly wireless, and have great bass, these are the ones for you. They aren't that big either, a big plus to be able to fit the charging case in my pocket. I'm also a fan on the wireless charging. They will work with any wireless charger",5,1,2019-8-17,1,2,1
"(Updated below)I’d love to have noise canceling ear buds, but can’t wait for the new Bose model which was scheduled to come out this year.  So I figured $40 is worth a shot. It took several attempts to find the correct sizing of the ear insert.  Still, though I twist the buds so part of my ear is holding it in, I still lose one now and then. Fortunately, I haven’t had any problem finding it.  The marking specifying R or L, is almost impossible to read, so I find myself putting them in randomly, then when they start up, they announced themselves as “right channel“or “left channel”. I have solved this problem by putting a tiny piece of scotch tape on one of them, so I can feel which is which.  The battery life is good, but if you are wearing these for extended listening, you will be disappointed. When the battery gets down to 20 to 30%, it starts announcing low battery every minute or two, which is annoying enough to force me to stop using them and putting them into the charging case.  Would be nice if it wouldn’t do that so often.  No volume control on the buds, but it does allow you to answer or hang up the phone calls with a tap.  Not disappointed.",3,1,2020-7-25,1,1,0
"UPDATE 2: I've been using the newest version of these that I was sent for 3 days. The sound quality is pretty good. They fit really well in my ear and have several different ear jelly sizes to make sure you get a good fit. The charging case is very small which makes it easy to keep in my purse or the pocket of my leggings when I'm working out. I already own the TOZO wireless charging pad, so I used that to charge my earbud case and it got a little hot, so I had to let the earbuds cool down before using. I used them in the shower because they're okay for showering, sweat, being in the rain. The seal on them was pretty good, so no water leaked past them into my ear, and they didn't fall out at all either. They are touch controls though which is a downside for me as I'm constantly accidentally touching it and pausing my music. This happened a lot in the shower as I was washing my hair, and even my hair was pausing my music because it got so heavy when wet that it would touch the earphone and pause it. I did probably scare my roommate by singing so loud with them in, but no shame no shame! BONUS, if you wear them in the shower while brushing your teeth, it sounds like a helicopter hovering and getting ready to take off for some bada** mission. I thoroughly enjoyed that... probably had way too much fun with it as a 26 year old, but I guess I'm still a kid at heart.Overall, I do like these headphones. I'll get used to the touch sensitivity soon. It's Coronavirus season right now so I shouldn't be putting my hands near my face so much anyways. Maybe that'll train me so I stop accidentally hitting pause.. :)  These have really great noise cancelling, sound quality, good base, good volume, easy to use touch controls (pause, fast forward, volume, etc) when you remember what to do. I like that they tell you what function you've just done (a cute lil' British lady says ""Volume up, volume down, forward, reverse, power off, etc"" when you use the touch controls. Again, I'm using a different version now (The T6 earbuds). The T10 were awesome sound quality, but I had a defective charging box I think. I loved them other than that. T10 or T6, both are decent and will be a good pair of buds. I would recommend you buy them based off of if you want light-touch control or a button to press, otherwise they're pretty comparable.",4,1,2020-3-6,1,1,0
"I don't understand almost 40,000 reviews that rate this product at a 4.5. These earbuds are utterly useless unless you are in a quiet room doing absolutely nothing including breathing. I like to talk with people while I am walking outside and even if a Tesla went by (meaning pretty much noiseless to my ears), the person on the other end was not only blasted with the magnified sound but they couldn't hear me talk. If I was in my home office, clients would comment on how loud my typing was. If my window was open, people would comment on my neighbors talking, which I could barely hear myself. I was trying to avoid spending 5x the money on Apple earbuds but I guess you get what you pay for.",1,1,2020-6-18,1,2,0
"***6/22 right earbud is broken, 4 months in, no water usage. Plastic wrap bubbled while working labor on a hot day and then they died, no clue except maybe reaction to sunscreen? In any case, worthless in only 4 months.I got these after seeing that my new Galaxy Buds have crap bass. Decided to give these a try and they look pretty. Fit is great, sound quality is awesome, and the portable charger makes regular usage a breeze.",1,1,2020-2-12,1,2,0
"I had high hopes for these earbuds for swimming laps. They are advertised as waterproof and good for swimming. The problem is, you are not supposed to submerge them, which is hard when swimming laps. It is not until you open the instruction manual does this image show up, so I couldn't tell until I got them. Some reviews even said they were good for swimming, which kind of baffles me. Anyhow. Sound was fine and they seemed decent, just not for doing what I bought them for. Will be returning.",2,1,2019-5-13,1,5,1
"I ordered these after doing much research, and I thought that for the price, they would be adequate. Boy was I surprised! Adequate is not.a fair description of these incredible earbuds. The sound quality on these is much better than the upgraded Apple wired earbuds I’ve been using with my iPhones (and I thought that sound was pretty good). As others have stated, the bass is clear, deep and rich. The highs are sparkling, and midrange is excellent. I’ve heard subtleties in the music I’ve only ever heard with my Sony MDRV6 over-the-Ear headphones.They were simple to pair (pair the right earbud to your device. the left and right pair themselves automatically). I paired them to two different devices. When I paired it to the second iPhone, the left earbud announced “paired to second device”, which is a nice confirmation.",5,1,2019-12-13,1,1,0
"These buds are easy to connect, they stay connected and should I go out of range as soon as I’m back in range the phone will connect quickly.  The sound is the best I‘ve had, so clear.  People don’t seem to know I’m using a Bluetooth anymore.  Love that I can wear one at a time.  So I charge the case and swap the buds as they start to die.  The connection is again quick on the ear bud swap.  Negative is they are quite large BUT they last at least 6 hrs (hence the large size for the larger battery).  Back to the good: They fit well and you have to do a lot to dislodge them, they just don’t fall out.",5,1,2019-11-25,1,2,1
"DON'T BUY THIS FOR KINDLE 2018!  The bluetooth does not 'grab on' for kindle (you have to manually configure it every time--which is a real pain.)  In contrast, I own both the Amazon Dot & an Alterola IE600P both of which once initially configured will grab onto the bluetooth without having to delve into the admittedly poorly configured Amazon Kindle setup.2nd--Voiceview on Amazon Kindle has an annoying 'click' each time a page is turned--which those of us that regularly use voiceview learn to ignore.  The problem with the TOZO T10 is that it apparently interprets the Amazon page turn click as an incoming call and therefore mutes the first few words of a book every time the kindle turns a page--making the TOZO T10 almost unusable with Kindle 2018 generation (Feb 2019 software build).",3,1,2019-2-11,1,2,0
"Update 3/12/20:  The case and left earbud have technical issues.  I keep them in the case, and it can be fully charged.  Next thing I know when I need to use the charging case it’s down from 4 to 1 light indicator, even though I haven’t used the earbuds at all.The left earbud randomly connects to my iPhone constantly.  While it is plugged into the charging case.  Very annoying.",2,1,2020-1-2,1,1,0
"I really wanted them to work, but I had to return them. I liked the sound and ease of use, etc but about the second time I used them the one for the right ear wouldn't turn on. Thinking that maybe I didn't have them in the case well I recharged them again with the same result.Updated 8/27/2020: - I have to hand to the support at tozo for seeing I wasn't pleased and making it right. I received the updated version TOZO T6 and so far they have worked perfectly. So much so I got my wife a pair for her birthday (I'll review them later). I don't want to go into all the differences between the T6 and T10 (yes the T6 are the updated ones) but I did want to point out a few things. First the earbuds are touch not push so there is nothing to wear out, think phone screen type thing. Secondly, the case is now slimmer so it fits in the pocket better if you want to carry the case with you. Pairing is automatic and the battery life seems that it might be better also.",4,1,2020-8-21,1,1,0
"I've had these since late November 2019, and I definitely used them 5-6 days of every week. Let's get one thing out of the way, I like bass. These most definitely keep up with my desires in this realm. If I had to complain about these headphones, it would be the battery life of the earbuds.. It's not so bad, really, and maybe it's only to support the wonderful bass these buds provide..After owning and using these for several months with the standard size earpiece, I decided to try some of the other ones. Long story short, I managed to lose all but the largest earbud tips, and it wouldn't stay in my ear for very long at a time.. I purchased some universal earbud tips by Jlabs to replace the lost ones that actually fit properly.. The combination of these two products is a wonder that needs to be told. It's just fantastic that the foamy earbud tips add a certain noise cancellation to such great bass.",5,1,2019-12-1,1,1,0
"After submitting my initial review. The company has reached out to me to send a replacement pair. Kudos to Tozo for monitoring reviews and attempting to make their customers happy. I will update if need be.Simply put, I tried these out briefly upon arrival and they had great sound and stayed in my ears well. I thought, great, they will do. Well, not having really put them to the test, I put them on the charger in my building to use for when I am mowing, weed eating, doing outside work, etc. The pair I previously replaced were a set of muff style cupped Bluetooth headphones which were great but when working, they trapped a lot of heat so I wanted something less concealing. As of yesterday, I started mowing and doing some yardwork. It was the real first test for my new headphones. Soon after starting, I noticed they disconnected but I thought maybe it was my phone switching from my house wifi to my mobile data. So, I reconnect and disable my wifi to insure I do not get any more distractions. Well, it happens a few more times and maybe 3.5 hours into working, the headphones start saying, ""battery low, please charge"". So, for the next 30 minutes, I keep getting these annoying messages while working and they finally die at around 4 hours. Then, since I am working and not close to my garage, I am monitoring these small earbuds to insure I don't lose them as sound is usually the indicator they are still with you and in tact. Of course, it is past the return window on Amazon at this point so now I have a set of earbuds not good for anything more than a few hours. I would not recommend these earbuds. Now, if the manufacturer is concerned about this review and feels I have received a faulty pair and want to send a replacement pair that work as advertised, I will edit my review.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,1,0
"I bought these as a replacment for my blue tooth my dog ate. At first I wasn't expecting much. But then after recieving them I was blown away by the quality! The packaging was the first thing I noticed, then once I opened them the build quality was amazing for what I thought would be a budget set of ear buds. Every detail was more then expexted the charging case was solid and well crafted. The ear buds were spot on with the pictures. The call quality has been amazing regardless of if I use one or both earbuds, and the same goes for the quality of sound while listening to music regardless of the source. Battery life is also impressive for such a small bud. And the fact that TOZO also throws in a year warranty is fantastic. I'd recoomend this to anyone looking for a great set of ear buds for single or dual ear usage.",5,1,2019-4-9,1,3,1
Worked great for three weeks then the earbuds stopped pairing with each other. Because of this I can only use one side at a time. Tried multiple times to reset them using the little instructions I could find online but they refuse to talk to each other. Seems to be a common problem with no solution. If I don;t get a response from the company soon I will be returning them.,1,1,2020-1-24,1,4,0

"Wow - color me impressed. I was not expecting sound quality this good, and bass this powerful, out of a generic pair of Bluetooth earbuds. I read the reviews though, and they seemed legit - trust me, they are. I was thinking this was going to be another piece of generic Chinese technology with some random brand name slapped on it - with a package insert promising free products or an Amazon credit in exchange for a good review (I've received products like that in the past). Thankfully, this is NOT one of those products. There is no incentive to leave a good review, so the good reviews are actually genuine.The only thing that was slightly disappointing at first was the quality of the bass - but that was quickly remedied (as others recommended) by swapping out the silicone caps on the earbuds with another size from the included sets, to get a better seal in your ear. It went from tinny to almost too powerful - I had to jack the equalizer on my phone back down to the normal range so my fillings weren't rattling. Now, with the proper-sized silicone caps, it sounds great.",5,1,2019-10-8,1,1,0
"When I first purchased these headphones they worked great. After the first month of daily use the headphones would not hold a charge. The connection with my cell phone would disconnect regularly. The battery life went from lasting all day to only lasting 2-4 hours. The last straw was the right ear bud completely stopped working.Make things worse when I purchased these headphones, I also purchased the extended warranty thinking that it would cover any issues. That was a waste. After spending over half an hour with then, I was advised that the extended warranty only kicks in after t the manufactures warranty is expired.",1,1,2019-8-21,1,4,0
"Update (11/3/19): Tozo customer service reached out to me and offered to replace the T10 earbuds with the newer T6. Their customer was very helpful and was great at communicating throughout the process from their initial contact. I have adjusted my review from 2 to 4 stars based on their customer service.  I will review the T6 once I have some time to break them in.  I stand by my initial 2 star review of the product itself, and hope the T6 is a higher quality product.For $50 these have a good sound, fit in ear well and when they work properly they're a fantastic value.  However there are issues that make me regret this purchase.  First, the battery in the charging case drains within 2 weeks, EVEN IF, the case is fully charged.  I use these mostly when I mow my lawn.  When I finish mowing I put them in the fully charged case and put them back on the shelf for next week.  I have been charging them every other use, so I'm depending on the case to provide at MAXIMUM two full charges to the earbuds between charging the case.  It seemed to work at first, but after several months of use, the earbuds are dead when I go to use them.  So now after every use I'm required to put them in the case, then plug the case in until the case is fully charged.  This cannot be by design as it makes the case essentially useless other than as storage.  Second, the left earbud disconnects at random several times during my roughly 1 hour of use.  Third and finally, when I go to use them I take out the right earbud first, as instructed, then I'll take out the left earbud AFTER the right earbud connected to my bluetooth source.  This fails to connect both earbuds 25% of the time, and I have to set both earbuds back in the case and try to start all over again.  Ultimately this comes down to ""You get what you pay for.""  I regret this purchase and should have spent the extra money on a higher quality set of wireless earbuds. 2/5 stars.",4,1,2019-10-17,1,1,0
"I got these today, opened the package and charged them fully. I paired them with Bluetooth on my new (3 days ago) iPhone. They sound pretty good so I put my phone in my shirt pocket and headed out for a walk. Immediately the left ear bud started to cut out. Then both started to cut out. Throughout my 60 minute walk they cut in and out the whole time.I might as well have bought a pair of corded headphones with a short in the cord.",1,1,2019-10-15,1,3,0
"I was hoping these would be at least as decent as my JBL or Apple headphones - but, wow was I underestimating these. Never heard of this brand (TOZO), and I'm always skeptical of overly positive reviews, but I literally can't find one thing wrong with these. While you can't control anything physically on the ear pieces, they do have built in mics for bluetooth, handsfree talking, and you can control the volume and sound FX when connected to your phone or device. What's most impressive is the bass these little things produce. I feel like I have a subwoofer in my head. They fit super snug, and cancel ambient sound better than any headphones I've owned. I truly hope these hold up. A+++++++UPDATE REVIEW 7/31/19:",2,1,2019-7-18,1,2,0
"These are absolutely amazing!  I reviewed many different earbuds and decided on these-I'm so glad I did!  I needed something I could work out with.  I was on the treadmill watching a movie on my iPhone, and the sound of the movie made me feel as if I were right there in the middle of the movie running for my life because the sound was outstanding.  The bass is perfect and the sound is better than any I have used.  They provide very clear, clean, and crisp sounds. I would highly recommend these to anyone.  I love the case and the charging station.  They fit snug in my ears and came charged and ready to use.  They paired with my phone very easily.  The noise cancellation was also great!  I can't say enough good about these! I love them so much that I might be ordering some for my husband as well.",5,1,2019-12-1,1,7,0
"Overall, it's a good product.  One thing that I do not like is the fact that I cannot easily skip songs or answer a call (I'm comparing to my previous LG headset).  The sound is really good, better than my LG model.  The pods are larger than I had expected and they stick out of my ear's quite a bit.  The microphone has some issues that I do not like.  Maybe it's because of the noise cancelling aspect, but it seems like I have to nearly yell to talk on the phone.  I found this quite uncomfortable especially in public area's.  Again, I'm comparing to my LG set, maybe that's how these ear buds are in general.  The privacy aspect and requirement of increased voice to make/answer a call is the main reason for my star rating.",3,1,2019-2-27,1,4,0
"Updated 06/06/2018:I originally thought the earbuds  were kind of garbage at first to be honest, but I didn't really give the product a chance. I received a replacement pair from the company, as I though their might have been something defective about them. Boy, I'm glad that happened. The sound quality is surprisingly good for these, and the value is fantastic. I've paid more than double for those other ""name brand"" headphones like Beats, and they didn't have anywhere near the quality these do. There's great separation on instruments, and I've heard vocals and elements I never did with other earbuds.",5,1,2020-3-6,1,1,0
"I've had these just under a year, and use them at least once a day to work out in the morning, and sometimes randomly beyond this morning use. They have worked great, the sound is good, it's amazing to be cordless!!! Changed my world. I do wish the battery lasted a bit longer but it's still good for 2-4 hours of straight use before dying. Unfortunately, a few weeks ago they started acting up and eventually just stopped connecting properly so they were useless. They come with a one year warranty that you have to register for thank God I did. I had some trouble getting a response to my initial claim emails because their email was incorrect for warranty claims, but once I just emailed the really info email on their site I got an immediate response, with some trouble shooting tips. Once I tried these and it did not fix the problem they immediately replaced my ear buds with a new pair. They arrived in two days. Overall I love this product. Not sure the life expectancy but every day use for a year was decent and their great customer service really made up for any issues. Would recommend!!!",5,1,2020-8-1,1,1,0
"After weeks of exhaustive research and swimming through literally hundreds of product reviews, I finally narrowed it down to two brands of earbuds I was in the market for. So in order to make and accurate and informed decision I ordered this pair and the Earfun Free set - both received outstanding reviews here on Amazon, and elsewhere across the net. Rather than go into the pros and cons of each brand (which has been done dozens of times already here), I will only suffice to state why I now decided to keep the Tozo T10's.Biggest deciding factor, sound quality, plain and simple. There is no comparison hands down! The Tozo earbuds have stellar sound, whereas the Earfun buds are extremely ""shallow"". These sport a solid rich bass, great volume, very good highs, and a substantial mid-range. This holds true for every genre of music I auditioned them with. The build quality is excellent, and so far the battery life seems to be on par with all other brands. The biggest disappointment (and its a big one) with these is their sad lack of controls. They are clearly designed with phone calls in mind - these are the only controls you have, aside from pausing a music track. I do not use mine for phone calls except once in a blue moon. ANY set of wireless earbuds should, at a very minimum, offer volume control. But, after running both sets through their paces, the Tozo T10's won by a landslide for their solid build quality and very impressive sound. For you techies out there, the difference between an 8 mm. driver (Tozo) and a 6 mm. driver (Earfun) makes all the difference in the world. For the price, the Tozo T10's are an excellent choice if fantastic sound is your main priority. As was mine.",4,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0
"EDIT: I've received multiple harassing emails from this seller/company regarding negative reviews, offering to give me another pair or to pay me $60, so long as I remove the negative comment.This is utterly dishonest.

"Have had them since August & they're slamming!  The sound is amazing, I can hear the tambourine in songs previously I'd only heard on my Bose system.The bass great but doesn't drown out other high & mid ranges which is important to me for quality music playback.  They pared easily together automatically when taken from the case..Four tip sizes included was 1 reason I kept them, I needed the extra small, still the buds are very noise cancelling, I have to take them out or turn the volume down if landline rings or doorbell while I'm using them, I certainly won't hear either!They arrived without flaws, packaged better than I could package a gift, btw they make a great gift considering price value & quality..

To give you an idea, I can hear electrical currents and air seperating when a door opens. These muffle out everything around me and people talking sound like blurbs. If your hearing is normal, then you shouldn't hear anything. If your hearing is below average, consider an alternative since the bass can drown out the treble.",4,1,2020-2-6,1,1,0
"I've only had these a few days and will still need to test the battery life and water resistance but initial impressions are good. First thing I loved is that the buttons are actual buttons that click when you press them. I hate poking at a hard plastic surface and hoping the touch controls respond. Second thing is that these headphones are Loud, which is great if you got a quiet podcast or just want rock out, but be careful if you have sensitive ears. The sound quality is pretty great too, more bass than I expected. Each earbud connects to a device individually so you can use one at a time if you want to, working while listening to a book or podcast.The only negative I can say is that they are a little big and don't nestle as neatly into the ear, but a bigger device could be a sign of a bigger battery with a longer life. But they still sit comfortably and securely, so barely an issue.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0

"I bought these to replace popdesign ipx7 wireless earphones that would just stop working every few weeks/months, they replaced them 3 times but enough is enopugh, time to move on. I bought these based on reviews and price. So far they seem pretty decent but it simply did not occur to me that there would be no controls for skipping songs, which is very annoying. I tossed all the packaging before discovering this and just cant be bothered to send them back and get the newer model which does have song controls. So buyer beware, a feature I assumed was fundamental and ubiquitous actually isn't. I know that's on me but if I had realized these did not have song controls I would not had made this purchase.Update: and after using these for a few hours I am getting constant pairing issues. Tried rebooting phone, closing apps, but still, earphones lose connection, song disappears then comes back in one earphone at a time, and sometimes this happens over and over again. I am going to be requesting a refund, simply unacceptable. The popdesigns worked fine in this regard, just kept breaking, but these tozo earphones cant seem to maintain connectivity fundamental to their function. Maybe I should go back to wired headphones.",1,1,2020-1-26,1,1,0
"I bought a first pair and lost them right away. So I then bought another pair because of the reviews that I had read. I use them to connect with my MacBook Pro. When first connecting them, they were fine and worked when I needed audio or sound. But since the first few times, they don't connect to my computer or any application (i.e. Zoom, Facetime, Skype, etc.) without a great deal of hassle. I'm a savvy (and heavy) computer and electronics user and I know how to adjust the settings so they work - I've connected other bluetooth earbuds and all of them work fine. But not these.Once they are connected, they aren't reliable. They'll drop in the middle of a conversation and I have to go back and manually disconnect and reconnect them several times and cross my fingers that it works.

"I love that these are waterproof; they have transformed my shower time! :) I like that they come with different sized adapters for the earbud part to make sure they fit. I have a couple of complaints, the first being that it seems to have a relatively short battery life (seems to range from 2-3 hours, less than some other bluetooth headphones I use). My second issue with them is that I like to use only one earbud at a time (like at work or when I need to keep one ear open, lol), but if you don't have both earbuds powered on at the same time, it will beep looking for its partner. It would be nice to keep one charged while I use the other one, but I guess that is more a personal preference than a design flaw.",4,1,2019-7-11,1,3,0
"i do not know why so many people give this product a good rating. They have to be used together or they will make a god awful ear piercing beep as they constantly search for the other earbud. it is such a shrill loud beep it is damaging to your ears. this also happens when pairing... They are a middle of the road earbud in terms of quality. If you want sound cancellation you need to jam them in harder. Also there is no option to turn the case off it always charges, so you can't prolong battery life by following proper charge cycles, you either risk misplacing them or you constantly charge them, pick your poison. The operational battery life is ok for how small they are, still i found it too short. the worst part is they don't last! I bought these in may of 2019, it is now november and the right earbud is dead, which means i can't use the left earbud at all. I am an occasional user, i used them to exercise a few times a week for 1-3 hours at a time, or to do gardening and house chores, so i by no means stressed them too much in that time. Also, You must have the right earbud to use the left earbud, it would be much better to have a solo sync option...

"Sound quality amazing. Easy to pair with Samsung S8. Call quality excellent and they said it sounded fine. No idea about longevity but my white TOZO T10 is way past my expectations so far. Charged it on a charging pad...perfect! Battery life has been good for me.Now that I have used them for a few days I am more impressed than I was initially. Take them out of the charging case and they link almost instantly and then to my S8 very fast. I have listened to music from my phone, my iPod, and a tablet. The sound quality for me is awesome. Let me say this when I put music on a device I put on the highest quality possible. Yes it takes up more storage to do that but since I can tell the difference it’s worth it. MP3 just doesn’t get it for me and I wonder if some of the reviews on sound quality have to do with poor source data. You have to be listening to lossless or the equivalent to make any comment about sound quality.",5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
"I am IMPRESSED at the quality of these headphones. Don’t let the price point lead you astray -these are exceptional. Over the last year I have tried 5 variously priced sets and these are freaking tops. One pair (Bose wireless set) was VERY bulky (and expensive) and had known connection issues so I returned them after trying two sets (other pair didn’t play and connect correctly in left ear). These in comparison are SLEEK, I’m not worried they’re going to get caught on something with how well they sit into my ear (see pic). Another thing to touch on is the way the magnets snap in -the JBL wireless set I was using required having the left bud placed verrrry carefully to even connect to the charge points. It often left that bud uncharged (if I moved the case elsewhere/did nothing at all) and became so frustrating I decided to keep searching for a new pair, even though I had tried so many others. I had lost a bit of hope but felt excited with the number of reviews on this set. The buds SNAP into the case to charge. I bet over time the magnet will relax a little, but I’m not even worried with how secure they are in the individual slots to begin with! (The case itself has three strong magnets to hold the case closed securely too, no worrying about earbuds falling out of charging case and getting lost in bags, these are super secure.) Not to mention the sound quality for this price is RIDICULOUS. Sincerely could compare to the Bose wireless set, but they function, connect seamlessly, and have great bass, I don’t even have to have them up very high when running outside. No more hearing the wind when I run, too (I live in a very windy part of USA). The voices on the startup/connection are different than I’m used to but doesn’t bother me even a little. Literally one critique that is so minuscule it could be considered insignificant: I wish the strap it comes with was nicer, thinner, and smaller. Overall, excellent buds, will recommend to anyone.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,1
"I bought these for my wife for working out, first off she has a rough time getting them to stay in her ears with any of the sizes, although they fit in mine just fine. They would not pair with her iphone 8 plus whatsoever. She could get it to connect but music wouldn't play. I tried it with my note 9 and I can get it to work sometimes but it takes forever to pair properly. Half the time it will pair one ear and wait 5 minutes to pair the other.In regards to battery life its ok...  says three hours on the link but lasted about 2 gym sessions of 45 minutes each before I needed to charge them.",1,1,2020-1-13,1,1,0

Tozo does not stand behind its product a simple replacement would have been nice but  they made me reorder.  There ear buds were faulty.You say you can’t post my last review on your site so I will go to social media and post about it.,1,1,2020-7-21,1,4,0
"I do prefer these headphones over the very pricey AirPods. I feel they fit much better in the ear and are smaller, plus you don’t have something just hanging down from your ear. My only complaint is that the headphones still connect with the phone even when it is in its container. If you do not manually turn the headphones off before putting it back in the case it will monopolize the sound. For instance, if the headphones are still on and you put it in the case and make a phone call, as soon as the call connects the headphones pull the call towards it, so I’ll sit there talking into the phone wondering why I’m not hearing anything only to realize it’s connected to the headphones. AirPods on the other hand, once in the case is automatically disconnected. As far as sound quality, price  and style, these are far superior, but there are little things that need to be fine tuned.",3,1,2020-3-19,1,1,0
"Update: I've been using these for about a month now. Bought two pairs and my wife has bow stopped using them because they fall out of her ear.  Battery life is not what they said it is.  Especially true if you are in the heat.  I got two hours out of them before having to recharge. Below is my original review and still true.I have plenty of other headphones to compare to include wireless dre beats, wireless jaybirds and base, but don't have experience with off brands.  I purchased two of these for my wife and I to mainly be a comm asset when participating in online meetings.",2,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"I'm a bit of an audiophile as I am into music production.These headphones are not good. First of all, they feel like they're going to fall off. The earbud is way too slippery/0 grip to stay in your ears and does not fit naturally or snug.",1,1,2020-7-2,1,2,0
Got my T10’s over the weekend.  Decided to see just how good the waterproof/sweat proof claim of these would be. Hopped on my bicycle and went for a three hour ride. I’m a big guy so I “sweat” these didn’t even once pause or skip. Wore them over six hours before one finally gave up. Oh and I only charged them once.  Sound quality is really good maybe not T12 level but still excellent.  Case is good and can tell the battery level easy enough but again the T12’s with the led case charge and earbud charge come out the winner.  If your looking for a good quality earbud I do recommend these.  If you want all the bells and whistles go get yourself a pair of the Tozo T12’s.,5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,1
"After only 3-1/2 months, with limited use (maybe 20 times over the past couple months), the battery no longer charges.  The little charging box is fully charged, my earpods blink off red almost immediately to blue almost immediately.  However, they are dead.  Cannot even be discovered by my phone.I would not buy them again.",1,1,2020-5-4,1,3,0
"Sound quality is comparable to cheap wired earbuds.  But this is true wireless, so you are paying for the bluetooth and rechargeable battery.Bluetooth range is minimally satisfactory, I have to use them and the phone in the same room with nothing blocking in between.  But if you will just put them in the pocket while jogging or working out, it will be fine.",2,1,2020-3-25,1,1,0
"I was super excited to get these in. My husband raves about his, but I didn't want to spend over $100 for something I will basically use when i'm grocery shopping without my kiddos. I was able to make phone calls this morning while sitting at my desk & had no issues, but when I went out shopping & made a call, My friend told me that my voice was going in & out. Not choppy but the volume was fading. My phone was right next to me, so I don't think it was a distance issue. I will try them again with another call to see if I need to return them.Sound quality for listening to music is great. I do notice that when i start Spotify, the volume is ear drum shattering HIGH. I can not figure out if there is a way to keep this from happening, but the first time it did it, i nearly jumped out my skin. I did notice that when my security cameras & ring doorbell notifications go off, the volume on my music will stay lower for a few minutes. It's not a reason to return, but something to keep in mind if you go to turn up the volume, you may end up with some really loud tunes happening all of the sudden! I really want to love these though. The fit is great, i switched to the smallest option for the gel buds part, i have tiny ear canals, they aren't bulky at all , actually pretty comfortable. I had them on for a few hours today & the battery didn't die, so that is a huge plus for me!",4,1,2019-12-2,1,1,0
"I go through a LOT of headphones/earbuds as I’m always looking for the perfect pair.These wireless earbuds get a 4-star rating because of the sound quality and waterproof rating.  For me, the sound is superb, rivaling my Bose Quiet Comfort headphones.  I will say though, they have a heavy base, that I love, but is not for everyone.",4,1,2019-7-21,1,1,0
I'm still on the fence of whether or not I will return these.Pros:,2,1,2019-6-28,1,2,0
"Great sound, deep bass and does a good job blocking outside noise. Call quality is great also. The ear tips are well made: they feel premium. But they feel bulky and stick out in my ear. The buttons are quite harder to press compared to others I’ve used. Battery life per charge is ok but I’ve seen and used longer ones. But these are not the dealbreakers or the reason I intend to return them: they constantly kept disconnecting and reconnecting, especially during phone calls and that was very frustrating. I’m disappointed in that regard. Otherwise, these would have been some great pair of earbuds to have.UPDATE:",5,1,2019-10-20,1,1,0
"Sound Quality is awesome, but ear buds keep falling out.",4,1,2019-2-1,1,8,0
"I was looking for an upgrade in buds, so came here for reviews for buds in the $50 range.Most reviewers pointed out how great the sound is, and this is very true. The bass is rich, but not boomy, and the mid-ranges and highs come through beautifully. I was really shocked at how good the sound quality is, compared to the cheaper buds I was replacing. The sound is stellar for music. I use the buds for music, youtube vids, and podcasts, so I'm a heavy earbud user. I use the buds at the gym, or just doing daily tasks, like food shopping. Again, the sound quality is excellent.",3,1,2020-1-4,1,1,0
I took a fair amount of time with this headset because of the various reviews. I initially compared it to my LG HBS810 ($99) which I've used for years. That was a mistake.You need to judge these on their own merits/demerits.  The design of the LG is too different from this set to make a reasonable comparison except in the areas of sound quality and fit.,5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,1
I am shocked that these wireless earbuds don't have volume controls.  I don't know why they would be good for anyone.I use earbuds when I listen to audible books while walking.  Sometimes there is lots of traffic noise and sometimes there is not.  I need to be able to change the volume often and I don't want to have to take my backpack off and dig for my phone every time.  I need the volume control on the earbuds somewhere.,3,1,2020-5-16,1,1,0
"Ahem.  Read the title again.  Need more?  Check out the reviews!  Have you ever seen anything that high before?!  Makes perfect sense because this is truly the best with no substitute.  I'll sum up the basics and make it short.  Crystal clear sound and the BASS sounds like you're wearing expensive headphones!  Deep punchy bass for rap is out of this world.  This can compete easily with Beats X and at it's cheap price, the best bargain online.  Period.  Here is probably the most crucial things.  TWO ACTUALLY.  When buying this, go for the newer colors.  My first black pair (initial release) often has music cut off at gym and not consistent.  Would constantly break in and out and quite frustrating.  So I eventually got a 2nd pair but this time, I went for the NEW Khaki color with rose gold trimming.  BIG improvement!  Also, if you want DOUBLE the bass, you need to separately purchase the COMPLY COMFORT PLUS 400!!!  $20 bucks for 3 pairs of memory foam earphone tips and it amplifies the bass to the next level.  Bass so strong that it might hurt the ears so don't go too loud.  Here is the link.  Your welcome!  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AQU2V38/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1All this PLUS great customer service!  Thank you Hannah!",5,1,2019-11-27,1,1,0
"These little earbuds are great- price, value, ease of operation- 10 stars! They connected immediately- the sound is fab, they are comfortable and the little case to charge/store them in is compact and handy. I just stumbled on them on Amazon and after reading reviews, I’m sold. I ordered the white because they’d arrive the fastest and with all of the zoom meetings and conference calls I’m on while Staying Home Staying Healthy- (WA) they’re are worth every penny!! Did I mention they are Super lightweight And comfortable? They come with 3 sets/sizes of ear adapters- they’ll fit anyone!UPDATE: After almost 2 months of daily use, (I don't have an hour range as they've only gone dead once and I'm sure  it is because I forgot to charge them. They last all day out of the the charger box. Not continuous but heavy all day use.) these are every bit as good if not better than I thought. I LOVE these ear buds!",5,1,2020-3-31,1,1,0
I purchased these to use during video conferences and possibly working out. For some reason the right side ear bud will NOT stay in my ear for longer than 10 seconds. I have tried every one of the size adjustments that came with them and even tried others I had from other products. Nothing worked!Also the ear buds are kind of bulky and lots of movement will cause them to fall out of my ears.,1,1,2020-6-1,1,1,0
"Need to wear the earbuds properly and snug in your ear to hear the bass. If the bass is not thumping simply means you are not wearing them properly! They need to be really snug in both your ears. Try different rubber caps to ensure perfect fit.Overall sound quality is good but cant compete with the bass from Jabra Move. The only reason i buy this is because of the IPX8 rating. So no problem to run in the rain and while swimming! Bare in mind, these buds are really small and comfortable to wear. Sometime i forgot wearing them.",2,1,2020-1-22,1,1,1
"BAD:1) L or R will loose connection temporarily [but long enough to be incredibly irritating] if I put the phone down and walk, or put the phone in my back pocket.  My cheap partly wireless earbuds do similar, but to a MUCH lesser degree.  My cheap wireless headphones can somehow keep a connection with the phone in the house, and me out doing yardwork.  2) you need the case... otherwise if you turn them off manually, they don't turn back on when you take them out of the case.  3) i've needed to reset (hold down power simultaneously on both until both have red+blue at same time, ~10s) several times, which means repairing.  3) case is bulky... should be large and slim but it's thick, so can't just slide it in a pocket.",3,1,2020-4-11,1,1,0
"I thought this headset had pretty good sound, but on first use they cut out every time I moved my head left or right. Dissatisfied I returned them for a refund. I later received an email from Tozo customer service offering a T6 or a giftcard to change my review. Thinking of giving them another chance. I requested to try an NC9 headset.  They offered one supposedly for free, but I would order and pay for it and get a credit to PayPal which I don't use. But all for a ""5 star"" review.  Which I decided is not worth an honest review of a defective product.",1,1,2020-8-2,1,2,0
"I own a pair of the Tozo T8's, had them for a few years and wanted to upgrade to something with more volume and better sound quality. I purchased the T10.  The build quality was impressive. The charging station, and earbuds in general were larger than the T8's, maybe something to do with the waterproof nature of them, maybe bigger drivers than the T8.  They did protrude from my ears much more than the T8, which I did not like. The sound quality was excellent. Very loud, good bass, good overall equalization, nice and balanced for such a small device.  The battery life was good.  I was VERY disappointed in the poor Bluetooth connection. The sound CONSTANTLY breaks up (doesn't disconnect entirely), to the point where I had to keep my phone always within 2 feet from where I was.  I couldn't even put my phone in my pocket or move my head from side to side.  Just constant , unnerving interruption..  killed my workouts!  I reset them as per the website instruction, I forgot device and re-connected, I shut bluetooth on and off numerous times. Nothing stopped the interruptions .  I have 3 other headsets and none of them do this. My T8s are better, my Jambuds (which hurt my ears) stay relatively breakup free within a decent range, my Vmoda Crossfades I can walk away 15 feet without an issue.. I literally had to hold the phone 1 foot in front of my face to get a decent constant connection with the T10.. even then it would sputter.  Sent them back, which stinks because I liked  the sound just fine.",2,1,2019-10-25,1,1,0
"I bought these because the headphone jack on my laptop is getting a little touchy, and I thought it would be neat to have totally wireless earbuds. These are that, and they have a great fit. Battery is decent for these class of headphones, and the charger is nice. Pairing was easy, and I like that it can pair two devices.Unfortunately, that's where my good experience ended. The audio lag on these with both computers I tested these on was absolutely awful--about .5-1 second. It was completely unusable for anything other than music due to this lag.",1,1,2019-5-6,1,4,0
"first of all - i paid $50 for these. now they are listed for $30 which is probably more accurate.I just didn't have good success with these. they rarely connect quickly, im always fumbling and having to forget the device and reconnect. when they do work there is often an echo. When im out cutting the grass they are abysmal because there is some kind of interference with my lawn equipment (never had an issue with any other bluetooth ear buds). if the holder isnt always plugged in it'll drain pretty quickly. right and left are never communicating well with themselves so one is regularly off or trying to connect and beeping. just overall this hasn't suited my needs. I'll switch back to my old set.",1,1,2019-11-8,1,1,0
"I will start this review with the positives.-I have been using these ear buds for just over a month now. The sound is actually pretty damn good. I was surprised by this. The low end gives a nice bass sound but not too much that kills the high end. It's a perfect balance! So the sound was definitely good. And after changing the ear bud tips, I was able to find a comfortable one that fits in my ears and will stay most of the time.",3,1,2019-10-2,1,1,0
"I have been using wireless headphones at the gym (and for running) for years. However, this is the first time I have had completely cordless headphones... and I am SO happy with the switch. I was concerned with the headphones falling out, but with multiple ear bud sizes included with this set, I was able to get the perfect fit. I'm an audio/video guru of sorts... and the audio is really solid. You may get a little better sound quality from higher end headphones, but these have a great, full sound... good lows. They connect and work like they are supposed to, and they block out most the sound around you. Leaving just a little tiny bit of room for some ambient noise... which is to be desired so we can remain spatially aware when the volume isn't up really high. These are not made for making phone calls (the mic is technically at your ear), but will work just fine if you get a call in the middle of something and don't want to switch to your phone.I am not a big fan of charging my headphones every couple days, so the protective case acting as a charger is pretty awesome. They clip into their little bays magnetically, which is super satisfying... and the charger lets you know how much juice it still has with some small LED indicators.",5,1,2019-7-24,1,1,1
"First time taking them for a walk, get 10min from home and they kept cutting on and off every 2sec - 3sec. Threw them in the nearest dumpster. This was after going though two sets of true wireless headphones prior to this so this would have been the third set in a row within the span of three or four weeks I think.After owning 3 pairs of 'true' wireless earbuds I'm going to go back to the LG HBS neckband style and get a new pair.",1,1,2020-3-4,1,1,0
"I've bought and tried 3 different allbeit similar styles all about the same price on here give or take 5-10$. These are my favorite.The case is slightly larger and made of a higher quality plastic that others and feels good in your hand, as in you aren't going to drop it handling it.",5,1,2019-7-23,1,1,0
"For the price, there is a lot to like here!  The sound is plenty good for everyday listening at the gym or around town, although I suspect ""real"" audiophiles will want something more accurate.  But for my uses, the sound is great.  Fit in my ears is good, although I do notice slightly louder sound in one ear, and I think I need to try different size buds to get a better fit (the louder sound stays in the same ear even if I switch L & R, so it's not a problem with the T10 - the problem is with my ears!).  I like the compact case and the wireless charging is a nice bonus.  Battery life of the earbuds seems pretty close to the claimed 3.5 hours.Just a few things that keep me from giving a full 5 stars.  One is that I would have preferred USB-C charging, just to reduce the different types of cables I have to keep track of.  Second is that these take maybe 30 seconds or so to pair with my phone (Pixel 3) when I take them out of the case.  Not a deal breaker for me, but just long enough to be annoying.  Next, I do get a slight audio lag when watching videos, which I have read is not uncommon with most of the true wireless buds like these, where the phone only connects to the R bud, as opposed to both L & R like some of the higher end earbuds.  Lastly is, if I leave the buds (fully charged) in the case and the case isn't plugged in, the *case* battery is drained after about 3 days.  So I can't count on the case being fully charged if I am heading out the door for a work trip or something like that.  Maybe the buds are constantly trickle charging from the case?  The case does charge back up fairly quickly, but it's still an annoyance.",4,1,2019-8-1,1,1,0
"This is my second time writing a review for this product. I'll make it short - the earbuds play scratchy, awful sound for pretty much everything. I listen to rap, death metal, plenty of classical music and the sound quality is the same - scratchy and bad. The Bluetooth lags, as well, and the battery life is subpar. I've had a pair of Phillips wired wireless earbuds for YEARS that perform much better than these.With that being said, I was emailed by the company saying that if I took down my first review then I would get a full refund. I received one odd email from the company and no such refund ever since. This review is going to stay up regardless.",1,1,2020-5-14,1,2,0
"I wear earbuds on my commute and my last pair kicked it (can't do stereo music through just one side!) and I'd spent enough time ripping my earbuds out of my ears by accident that I decided to switch to wireless. These seemed a good price and had good reviews. They come with the case, the charger cord (plugs into the case), and several different sizes of earpiece caps. It's also very easy to register for the manufacture's warranty.Charging: The earbuds kind of snap into the case, so it's no fuss to get them aligned on the charger (a battle I've had to fight with other electronics). Another thing I really liked is that you charge up the case, and then it can charge the earbuds four times (per the box, haven't gotten to test that out yet), so I can put the earbuds in the case once I'm at work and they'll be charged back up for the ride home without have to leave them in the case and the case plugged in. I don't particularly know about the battery life because I haven't really tested it out.",4,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"I got these last week. I like mostly everything about them so far, especially for the price. They were on sale, plus Amazon points, so it was $20 for me. However, my biggest complaint is that IT WILL NOT pair one of the earbuds. It very annoying. Sometimes I will use just one earbud, but then I want to use the other, and it will say cannot connect. I've reset them, but still, cannot pair. I've had this before, but after sometime it worked. But really, who has enough time and energy to spend 1 hour to make it work? Really.Update: few days later - it paired and has been paired for a fee days now, when I take it out of the charging box.",4,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
Good value. I bought these when I lost my Airpods. They sound so good I was in no hurry to get the airpods as a matter of fact I just got the airpods for an early Christmas present and I have no need to open them. ( may try to trade up to the AirPod pros. In the future)I gave stored these in the shower at the gym and I was concerned that they were toast wet toast. But after a little gurgling on the sound once I allowed them to dry out they worked again.,5,1,2019-11-27,1,2,0
"I have always used the standard chorded earbuds, as I have always been picky about earbud comfortability/sound quality. My go-to have been the chorded Skull Candy ear buds, but after these broke (as they always do every couple of months), I decided I'd invest in a better 'bud.After sifting through Amazon, I concluded that TOZO were the best headphones I could buy on Amazon for the most affordable price, and purchased the TOZO 5.0 Wireless earbuds via Prime. After arriving, I was impressed by the design--the sleek case, the comfort and weight of the earbuds, and the way they ""snapped"" back into the case because of the magnetic force. And on top of that, I know I didn't have to worry about these earbuds getting ruined by water. After listening to some tunes, I was impressed by the sound quality, specifically the base. I've used the Apple Airpods and Airpods Pro, and the sound quality of the TOZO earbuds is quite competitive. No, it is not as good nor better, but I would say the TOZO earbuds were about 9/10 of the sound quality for 2/10 of the price of the Apple earbuds! Otherwise, I would say both the case design and earbud design are more appealing than the Apple earbuds.",5,1,2020-4-21,1,2,0

"I got these for when I'm out in the pastures working - I didn't want the hassle of having a cord dangling.  (I kinda wish I had that cord now - see below).Good: The earbuds are light, and with the additional sizes of earcaps provided, you should be able to get the correct size for your ear canal.  The pairing with a phone is very quick and easy, and each earbud announces when it has connected.  Sound quality is pretty good, and well worth the price. Noise cancellation is good due to the in-ear sealing.  Battery life is pretty good - I got three to three and a half hours of continuous use before it announced battery charge was low and to recharge.",4,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"Sound quality is pretty darn good, nothing like a great overear set but better than most earbuds.Fit design is perfect for me. This is the second pair I've had from Tozo & they haven't changed the physical aspects of their earbuds.",2,1,2020-8-13,1,0,1
"OK, so this is the second pair of earbuds I bought this week as the first ones, (not Tozo), had nice sound but volume had to be maxed out and still didn't get there.These T10 buds however, nearly blew my ears off as my phone volume was still up on max as they paired.

Sound - These earbuds were tested watching movies and listening to various genre of music.

"These are not usable headphones, it will cut out on the left ear if you press your phone into your left hip.  I suspect the Bluetooth reception may have trouble reaching the 'master' right side earphone through the human body.  I also see it cutting when I've held the phone with my right hand (to stay on side of the master receiver), and turned my head left or right, similarly cutting out reception when my phone orbits my head.  Not sure why, but imo definitely should happen and not even a possible limitation to Bluetooth itself.  Bass also sucks, out of the box, the treble is predominant (tinny).On a live test run, I hiked about 90 minutes over 4.5 miles.  Rather than focus on positives (all things which should ""normally be expected), here are the additional negatives that convince me to return the product:",2,1,2019-6-22,1,1,0
UPDATE:Customer service is AMAZING. They reached out to me and immediately fixed my problem. I needed new sizes to fit into my ear and not only did they send them for free but then even paid for the shipping. I absolutely recommend this company and their products. based off their integrity alone.,5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"UPDATE: I have used these a few times at the gym now. I have discovered that you just can’t move the phone while you’re listening or they skip. As long as your bluetooth device is in one spot they work fine, but as soon as you start moving around, they skip frequently. It’s almost like they keep swapping phase, not really cutting out entirely. Vocals tend to be louder in one ear and then it “skips” and suddenly it’s opposite.First impressions after one hour of constant use:",3,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"They sound good for their price, and seem to have about a 3 hour battery life. A few things to note:- The left channel will cut out randomly if you're moving quickly in populated environments. This is more noticeable if you're in a city. I suspect it's just sensitivity to 2.4ghz noise, and less common if you have some electromagnetic shielding (like if you're in a car or plane). Unfortunately even a jog around the neighborhood will cause this issue. Due to frequency of signal loss, these are unusable for stereo audio while cycling or skating outside.",4,1,2020-7-22,1,1,0
"I got these for two purposes - 1) I wanted to listen to music and podcasts while I blow dry my hair and 2) I wanted to wear them for short runs.  The sound quality on these is ok, they stay in my ear ok, but the second I try to do any activity with them, they start to have problems.  One headphone will cut in and out occasionally, but the bigger issue is that they get out of sync, so there's an echo on what I'm listening to.  Sometimes this can be solved by powering down and back on again, but that's really annoying to do multiple times on a run.  Also, even when I only use these to blow dry my hair (~ 20 minutes), I find that I the battery case is pretty much dead at the start of day 3.  Pass on these and look for something better.Side note, the seller offered me a wireless charger in exchange for a 5 star review and I hate it when sellers do that.",1,1,2020-4-20,1,1,0
"I've had these for 2 days now and I must say, the sound quality is superb. The call quality is superb transmitting and receiving. I have been told that I sound as if I'm speaking directly through the phone. The fit is surprisingly comfortable and I am using the large insert. I was using the medium inset but I found the right ear becoming dislodged often. I love how quickly they pair to each other and to the phone. The convenience of the wireless charging is another great feature I must say..... rocks! I place the holder in my car's wireless charger and instantly start charging. I had the right ear unit fall onto the ground and what a relief to see how durable the buds are. Barely a tiny nick and the unit works great. A++ on durability as well.I was concerned about the talk time on them but since they charge back up to full so quickly it is pointless. I read they are 4 hr talk time on one charge so if you can recharge them 3 to 4 times, you've got 12 to 16 hours of talk time. PLENTY!!! You'll never be out of charge basically.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Since posting my original middling review on Amazon, the company’s customer service proactively reached out to me with concerns that the earbuds I received may have been a defective item.  I must say that floored me because I had previously stated in my review that I had no intention of returning the earbuds... and I am still within window to return them as I write this updated review.Tozo’s customer service offered to either give me a gift card for the purchase price I paid or to give me an upgraded set of Tozo earbuds.  Not really interested in the cash, I took them up on the offer of the upgraded earbuds.  I received the Tozo T6 earbuds and could not be happier.  A quick note on the differences for folks who may be comparing these two:",5,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0
"The pair I got CONSTANTLY dropped the left earbud every 5-10 seconds.  This drove me crazy while I mowed my lawn and, after much testing, I think I figured out what the problem was - my friggin' arm! Every time my arm blocked the connection between my Galaxy S9 and the earbud (an overall distance of maybe 2 feet), it would cut out for 1 to 2 seconds.  It got really annoying really fast.  A cheaper pair I had given to my wife NEVER had this problem.  Remaining thoughts:Pros:",2,1,2019-5-5,1,3,0
"I bought these to use at work for listening to music and calling into meetings. I have very small ears, and unfortunately these just would not comfortably fit nor stay in my ears no matter which size tip I used or how I oriented them. The other thing I did not like about them was that when the battery gets low, they repeatedly beep a piercing beep and say “low battery!” every 10 seconds or so until you rip them out of your ears. The battery didn’t last a full work day, so this got annoying pretty quickly. I tested them for about a week before returning them.I did like the case style and being able to charge them easily inside the case. I’m sure these will work well enough for most people.",2,1,2020-3-12,1,2,1
"Well I can say I did a bit of research regarding earbuds.  I needed a set of earbuds that would fit an active lifestyle in hot out door environments and pool time. Majority of the use would be doing long runs and lots of sweat and sun.  I also didn't want to have to spend all my petty cash on one product. Well these seemed to be the earbuds for me. I have to say,  with only one day of use I was impressed with the easy connection and sound quality. I went on a short 2.5 mile run. By mile 1,  the earbuds took turns falling out of my ears. I was not happy having to stop and pick up an earbud and continue running.  My run became a constant check and finger poking to keep the earbuds in place.it could be that I have shallow depth ear canals. If you have deep set ear holes and some what on the large size, this may the the buds for you.  I am sorry to say that I just cant use them for the one thing i needed them for. Listen to music while running. I  think my brother (non runner and couch potato) will love these. Happy Birthday bro. You just got some earbuds. I am back to the long boring process of looking for another pair of earbuds that will stay in my ears while running .",4,1,2019-5-15,1,1,0
"Had a member of a Facebook Droid group talk about these Bluetooth earbuds and so I ordered a set. Was not prepared for how good they preformed. I'm no audiophile but I know great sounding buds when I hear them and these are amazing. They needed to be charged out the box but it took less than an hour to get them juiced up. Once charged, I took them out the case and they paired immediately with each other and paired with my Moto G Stylus within seconds. The sound quality was awesome not to mention they can get REALLY loud. I will definitely enjoy using these daily. They fit my ears really well with no pain (I'm using the smallest bud ear set) and I can not hear any outside sounds once turned on. I would definitely buy again and I highly recommend.",5,1,2020-5-14,1,1,1
"UPDATE: 9/10/19SO BUMMED!! Love the features, the look and sound quality is great EXCEPT the left earbud, which only connects to the master right earbud, cuts out constantly!

"At this point in my life, I don't get excited about too many things. But I was so impressed by these that I've been recommending them to everyone.At first, I was very reluctant to switch from wired headphones since I have a few pairs that I like and have been keeping my iPhone 6s on life support so that I still had a headphone jack. But running and working out would just be so much more enjoyable without the dangling wires, so I bit the bullet and got a different pair of wireless earbuds. These had occasional connection problems when getting jostled around (running and working out) so I went to return them but misplaced one and missed the return window before I found another. I decided to purchase this pair as a replacement since they are waterproof - a nice feature to have.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"I purchased these earbuds after some previous (slightly cheaper) earbuds weren't working.  These didn't work either, but the problem was with with my phone after a recent update.  I got them working.  I kept these even though I liked the others better, because it was not the manufacturer's fault.I have a problem with wired earbuds always falling out of my ears -- but these wireless ones stay in no problem.  I have yet to have one fall out.",4,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"Update** I've now tried half a dozen other wireless earbuds, but I've decided to keep these. Not because they're perfect, but because, despite it's flaws, its sound and overall quality is better than all the others I've tried in the $30-40 range. After 3 or so weeks of using these, I still love the amazingly clear sound and thumping bass sound. The only thing that annoys me is that, I use my ipod to listen to music (while exercising outdoors) and these earbuds will cut out if I suddenly turn my head, or when I place the ipod in my back pocket, or move them anywhere off the bluetooth's straight line of connection that they need to stay within to avoid cut offs....oh, they also cut off when I covered my ears or wiped sweat off my face (covering my ears briefly). However, if you don't do anything to disrupt the bluetooth's straight signal path, they work and sound absolutely great. Unfortunately, the other wireless earbuds I'd tried and returned cut out even when I was just walking forward without disrupting the signal's path in any way. Just ordered the T6s for fun....will be arriving in a few minutes.Lets just say I've tried better known Samsung and Apple Airpods and I returned them both almost immediately. Their sounds were so shallow and tinny....just awful...and decided to stick with my corded earphones...till now. Yes, I love good sound when it comes to my music, but finding the ideal wireless earphones is such a chore...usually ending up in disappointment and frustration. Then I stumbled across this set, out of curiosity from reading the very positive reviews, I decided to try them out..without too high of an expectation in this price range. Wow! I was really..and I mean REALLY amazed, blown away, and very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sound and ease of setting it up with my ipod. The sound was so amazing....wonderful depth, base, treble, clarity.....and all for under 40?! Seriously?!......blows the Samsungs and airpods out of the water for sure. Now so glad I bought these and will use them for my workouts, walks around the park, and leisurely listening.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"*Update* My earbuds have worked well until fairly recently, when they stopped charging wirelessly, and the left earbuds has started cutting out while sitting at my desk. I have contacted support and they have been friendly and very helpful. They have offered to replace the earbuds at no charge for me, and I a so far satisfied with my experience with them.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",5,1,2019-10-9,1,1,1
"Let me start by saying that this is my first pair of in-ear headphones in a long time.  I did voiceover for awhile, so I have a pretty good pair of over-the-ear cans left over from those days, and while no expert, I believe that I have some idea of what good sound quality should sound like.  These?  These, they decidedly aren't bad.  While a little underwhelming on the bass end (I don't listen to a lot of hip-hop or electronica, so it's not a deal breaker for me, you're mileage may vary), the mids and highs are crisp and distinct.  There is a rich, nuanced quality to the sound, and vocals are delivered with surprising clarity.  On this front the TOZO T10s have exceeded my expectations.But that alone wouldn't get me to a 5-star review.  No, credit for the 5th star goes to the ease with which these paired to each other and to my phone.  These came late evening, so when I opened the box I just plugged in the charging case (it supports wireless charging, but I don't yet have a pad), and tossed the buds back into their respective spots (buds and case are both marked).  Buds gave a satisfyingly solid magnetic 'click' as they dropped into place.",5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"Before ordering these TOZO earbuds I read tons of reviews. To make sure I got a good sense of the product I read all different kinds of reviews. But the reviews that have been left were right. These are great TWS earbuds.Sound: The mids are clear, the highs are prominent without being tinny. The bass is strong and does not drown out the mids and highs like some very popular brands. The sound stage has depth and is full and rich.",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"Update: I dropped one of my earbuds and it stopped charging so I replaced with the white set. I didn't notice a difference in the product description but the white set has a touch interface rather than a button, which is quite sensitive but I'm getting the hang of it. The battery life is about half again as long as the black set with the button, and with comparable audio quality. I'm happy with my purchase and increasing my rating to 5 stars.I purchased these earbuds  to replace an older pair with nearly identical specs from a different manufacturer. These earbuds immediately impressed with excellent sound quality and noise cancelling. I work in a warehouse with a decibel level just below the point at which OSHA requires the wearing of earplugs, so that was really important for me. This far outstrips my old earbuds, of which one still works acceptably in quieter environments. At work, I can't clearly hear my audiobooks at max volume on the old one; new earbuds,  still in the ""safe"" volume on my phone, I can hear with crystal clarity.",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0

"I work from home and use my Jabra Evolve 75 headset for most phone calls and web conferences (Webex, Zoom, etc.) so these are my benchmark to compare the Tozo T10s.I purchased the Tozo T10s 1) because I'm generally not a fan of ear buds and gave my expensive Galaxy buds that came with my GS10+ (VZW) to my daughter, and 2) because the cord for my older bluetooth ear buds (TaoTronics TT-BH06) was always getting in the way and stuck to my neck if put it behind my ears.",4,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"Sound quality was impressive, however... Wireless earbuds have a long way to go before they can ever compete with wired earbuds. As an engineer, I respect the effort this company made. It is extremely difficult to design wireless earbuds that can ever compete with wired earbuds. These earbuds along with others are going to regularly fall out of your ears and you will spend at least 45 minutes a day looking for them. It is currently impossible to give any type of wireless earbuds a long battery life due to the battery size restrictions. The design of the charge ports was flawed. They very quickly become problematic. Within a few days the earbud charge connectors can become covered in a tiny amount of dust and stop working properly. I think this company got a B+ for effort. The quality looks nice but I'd recommend sticking to some good quality wired earbuds. The annoyance alone of have to stop what your listening to just to charge them is going to get rather irritating after a while. I wouldn't be surprised if these are better then some of the Apple over priced earbuds. They are neat, but not practical at all.",2,1,2019-12-28,1,1,0
So i wanted a pair of wireless earbuds to keep the cables away from my neck area especially when i work outside. So far these are going to work. The sound is good for the price. Battery life is good and knowing i have the cradle to charge them back up is beneficial. The issues I have come across is the reason why my overall rating is low. I only had one in and the other in the charger. Wondered why my one wasn't working. They both need to be off the cradle. Not a huge issue but some what of an issue. The other was again only having one in and the other on my night stand. Walked downstairs and then the music started to cut out. I had my phone with me so wasn't sure the reason. When I went back upstairs to the other earbud the music started to play again. This is a bigger deal because i tend to only have one in unless i am working out. Again maybe for the price of these i shouldn't expect more but not sure if there is something that is out there that would close some of these gaps.,3,1,2020-1-31,1,1,0
"I use my headphones on a daily basis at the gym-- I had been using a pair of BOSE headphones for the past 6 years, and they recently stopped working. I decided to try the TOZO earbuds based on a recommendation from a friend and I am so pleased!I truly believe there is no better option when you consider cost and quality of sound. Most surprisingly, the bass in these earbuds was much better than my BOSE headphones! I've also had the opportunity to test the water resistance features, I went on a run in the middle of a storm and the headphones still work now 2 months after that sudden soak.",5,1,2020-3-10,1,1,0
"This is my first pair of bluetooth earbuds, so the only thing I can compare them to is my previous wired ones. These sound better than any of my previous earbuds. The bass is very solid without being muddy. There's good balance in the midrange and treble. The volume goes as loud as I would ever want. The sound isolation (they aren't noise  cancelling) is almost as good as my pair of wired earbuds that are specifically designed for noisy environments. It's not problem listening to music while mowing the lawn with these. Pairing with my iPhone SE was a no-brainer, just take them out of the case, wait until they hook up with each other, then tell the phone to connect. One other undocumented feature I like is the ability to use the right earbud alone. If you leave the left one in the case the right one will hook up in mono mode and you can listen with one ear while using the other ear to hear what's going on around you. The right earbud is the master that connects to the phone and the left one connects to the right one. I've not found a way to use the left earbud by itself. I'm very happy with the quality and features, particularly at this price. In the box was an offer for a 1 year warranty if you register online.Edit-turns out there is a way to use the left earbud by itself. You have to pair it up separately from the right one. It shows up in the Bluetooth menu with an “L” following the name. Once paired, you can pull the left earbud from the case leaving the right one in the case and it will hook up and played by itself.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0

I am very impressed with these especially for the price. I bought these to replace another bluetooth pair of similar cost. After only a month or so I was having constant problems getting them to sync and connect appropriately.First impression straight out of the box is these feel like a much higher quality product. I was also thrilled to immediately notice a QR code link to an 18 month extended warranty.

"I waited about a month before I wrote a review on these headphones. I wanted to try them in the gym for several weeks first. Bottom line, as expected, they fall out. The sound is great and they’re good headphones for driving or even working out if you’re not doing too much movement. But for running, they fall out almost immediately.",1,1,2019-7-29,1,4,0
"In the times I've had these headphones my experience with them has been almost nothing but positive. The pair I ordered did originally break, but after contacting support I was able to quickly get a replacement. Support was extremely helpful, and I love these earbuds. The sound quality on them is amazing, and they cancel noise extremely well. For the price the sound quality and comfort levels are top-notch. The range on the earbuds is a pretty good distance, as you can move a decent amount from what they are connected to before encountering stutter or disconnection. They are also IPv8 waterproof which is a nice to have feature. The few issues I do have with earbuds are as follows. The battery life on the earbuds alone isn't super great, but it's usually enough to get through a full day of mid range usage before running out. This however is somewhat solved through the carrying case, as it holds a large charge for a long time, and the earbuds charge fast. The case is a bit large, but it's a decent trade off for the battery life and charge it supplies. I do wish the earbuds had some more button capabilities, as the only options it provides is to play or pause what you are listening too, or to answer a phone call. However, I do feel that these don't bring down the experience of them by a noticeable amount. They are much cheaper than many name-brand wireless earbuds, but provide an excellent listening experience. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for wireless earbuds.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"Got these because a family member recommended them and they're great!Overall, I'm probably most impressed with mic quality during phone calls.

"I have used different brands of ear buds. The overall quality on some have been just OK, but all have had the same issue for me: they do not come with a wide selection of ear rubber cups and, after using the largest one included, the ear buds would fall after a few minutes of walking.These ear buds come with many size rubber cups, and I found one that fits perfect!

"These headphones have some good feature: simple set up, quick connecting bluetooth, loud volume, multiple ear fitting options (4 options for a more customized fit), and two optional charging methods (wireless or traditional plug - which it comes with). As someone who has typically used apple headphones, for me personally the sound quality was okay. The average 4-hour battery life was okay as well. There were two deal breakers for me. (1) I could not use the left and right ear plug independently, as the left has to connect to the right to connect to a device. I primarily use these at work, and need to leave one ear 'open' so alternating between the two seemed ideal as to prolong the battery life. Despite some reviews claiming that they can connect independently, I did not find this to be the case. (2) There is no button/way to move to the next song. I was thinking this was relatively standard, however, this is not possible with this set. Overall, this set is okay; however, I did end up returning these. I was initially drawn in by the sheer number of reviews. But, I feel as though there are some alternate options at this price point that are a bit more 'well-rounded' such as the ENACFIRE E60.",3,1,2020-6-28,1,1,0
"These stylish earbuds have 8mm speakers, crisp sound, decent base. Tozo has individual microphones per each ear piece. variety of ear piece sizes (small, medium , large). 3.5 hours playtime. Waterproof. They also come in 5 colors which I wasn't aware of when I made my purchase ( I would may have opted for the blue, white or khaki) All these features for $32.99 with promo 20% coupon price beats the overpriced apple airpods $129 for what I need it for (talking and listening to music). I'm not going to be running for 3.5 hours. I generally don't run in the rain but it's good to know if I did in light rain the tozo can handle it. Good crisp sound with a decent bass make listening to music a pleasure. The compact charging case has a sleek cool design and charges pretty quickly and lasts a while per charge. It also comes with a lanyard to carry around your neck if  you want to for wearable charging on the go. I'd definitely recommend these if you are looking for budget friendly wireless earbuds at an affordable price.  I also purchased the wireless charging pad which works with these also at a great price. I'm a new customer of TOZO but am very excited to explore their other products as they have a line of audio products which are stylish and affordable. Go TOZO!",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
"After doing comparison shopping regarding different brands, price points, and reviews, I decided to give this set of ear buds a shot. I didn't see the need to spend $100 or more, and based on the majority of reviews I figured now was the time to invest. I was not disappointed. I've only used them for a couple of days, but I'm impressed with the sound quality. I watched some tv shows and movies on my phone with them, and the sound couldn't be better. The bass is amazing. The set-up was very easy to connect to my phone (my Amazon 7 tablet doesn't recognize them, tough), and the whole process from the opening of the box to using them to make a call took a couple of minutes.

And, with the provided differently-sized ear adapters, you can fit these right into your ears in a way that seals off the outside and gives you an immersive audio experience.One issue I had at the beginning - which many other people have noted - was the two ears getting out of sync or sometimes the left ear dropping out.

"The copy of the Tozo earbuds I received initially worked fairly well  upon receipt with the big caveat of pairing and connectivity issues. Namely, after the original pairing between phone and earbuds, the buds would only connect to the phone if manually selected in bluetooth settings in iOS 12 despite the fact that they are supposed to automatically reconnect to the previously paired device (as almost all BT headphones do). I went through numerous troubleshooting steps including re-pairing with the phone, as well as pairing with other phones and devices. In all cases, the earbuds would pair but not automatically connect for subsequent uses. I contacted Tozo support and they walked me through more troubleshooting, with no change. As a result, Tozo sent me another unit while giving me the option to return the originals (but at my own expense for shipping, which is why I chose not to). Here's where it gets strange. After receiving the new unit, I followed the same pairing steps and got the exact same results until the last time when I forgot to remove the first unit from the BT devices list before pairing the second unit. In other words, both Tozo sets were paired to the same device at the same time. When I realized the mistake, I deleted the first unit leaving only the new unit, and continued testing. From this point on the connection behavior changed; instead of NEVER connecting automatically, now the earbuds would connect automatically after about 15-20 seconds. This is a rather long time considering A) every other BT listening device I own connects in 1-5 seconds (all of them!), and B) the Tozo earbuds turn off after about 30 seconds if no device is connected. Stranger still, after the dual pairing the original unit started to behave in this same way. I was baffled enough by these events to begin to question both my intelligence and my sanity - but then I remember how many times I paired and re-paired with at least 3 separate devices and carefully  and patiently observed the results. Take it with a grain of salt if you must, but SOMETHING happened that caused the earbuds to start behaving differently.Having said all of this for the sake of completeness, I can actually comment on the typical device characteristics.",4,1,2019-8-21,1,1,0
"I love these headphones! I actually bought them because I wanted bluetooth earbuds and needed a placeholder until I could order the AirPods Pro (the original AirPods seemed uncomfortable). But after having these for a few weeks, I liked them so much that I cancelled my AirPods order!

I always wear them at the gym. They’re super comfortable, never fall out of my ears, and the sound quality is great!

"How come this has 30k+ reviews and 4.3* in general? And who gave 5s to this product? 5 means one of the best, and TOZO T10 is just not. There are a couple of problems not related to sound or connectivity, but to inconvenience when using them every day.1. Physical buttons",2,1,2020-1-24,1,1,1
"Very pleased with this purchase. The case acts as a stand alone charger. Different bud sizes offer good fits for all sizes of ears. Each earbud will pair to your device independently or together as Left and Right (Just pair the Right one first). Battery life is around 4 hours continuous stream. I've seen better, but for the price of this unit 4 hours is way above par. I usually listen to talk radio all day so I just use one bud at a time. When the battery is about to run out you will get 4 notifications about a minute apart to charge the unit shuts off. Pop the dead one in the case and use the other one for 4 more hours. Full charge takes about 1 hour unplugged and 30 minutes plugged into charger. Range is about 15 yards LoS but drastically drops as soon as anything obstructs LoS, which is common for bluetooth. Others say that the call quality on their side is good. Overall very please with my purchase.",5,1,2020-5-31,1,2,0
OMG Overpriced Name Fruit brands need to stop the madness. These airbuds are fantastic. AND a great price.!! I paired it with everything I use. Easy Peasy. I can hear the little beeps my phone makes typing this review and its crystal clear. I can't wait to drown out my noisy coworkers tomorrow and jam to my tunes. I love these airbuds and i love the color my son doesn't like the color but who cares its my first bday gift of the month. NOW all I need is a wireless charger thingy too. If anything funky happens I will re review but They look and feel like quality. Im a pretty honest cookie I believe in consumer power and these little buds are giving me great vibes. Happy Birthday to me!!!Update! !!Used at work listened to law and society text book and was at my own personal club. Loved it. Cute too.,5,1,2020-3-2,1,1,0
"I waited for a month before writing a review. Overall, very, very good. Battery life is plenty long. Unlike the another brand of white pods, these don’t fall out of my ear. The plug type pod gives really good passive noise reduction enabling you to hear your music even in noisy environments (including airplanes). As others have noted, from time to time the left pod will lose connection, albeit only very briefly and then it restores on its own.I’m definitely not an audiophile, so I have no comment about the quality of the sound.",4,1,2019-3-20,1,3,0
"I was hopeful that these earbuds would give me the wireless sound experience for a lower price, but it’s been six months since I purchased and I use them less and less every day.

"I bought these based on very high reviews and ratings and am very surprised. The headphones are nice and do work, there are however major design flaws.1. The earpods do a great job by toning down phone notifications when I'm listening to podcasts and music. However, if the music/podcast stop and the earpods are still in my ears, the phone notifications are deafening and super painful. I have to rush to take out the earbuds in between whatever I'm listening, otherwise I'm risking a major ear damage.",2,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0
"I originally got these headphones for sailing because they're small and waterproof. I have since used them a lot and have decided that I would not take these out on the boat because I know I would lose them immediately.Sound quality is good and battery life is acceptable. I rarely have them run out of juice because when you store them in the case, they charge. You can get about six hours out of a fully charged set/case. And all the charging involved is very quick. The case has wireless charging which I can state is compatible with a samsung wireless puck charger. I have only used that to charge it and have had no problems. The batteries charge very quickly, the case takes about 30 minutes to charge fully.",4,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I loved these headphones, they are incredibly easy to use and the sound quality is great. However, if I play them for more than 30 minutes, they go in and out of working. This is super frustrating when I'm trying to meditate or dealing with an anxiety attack when I'm trying to focus on music or ASMR. Im wondering if this is just my pair or a common thing. When I went to contact customer support, the email address on their website is invalid. So I have no way of contacting customer support to get help. The support on their website is just the manual that came with the headphones, and no troubleshooting or chat or anything.Update: Amazon was kind enough to issue me a replacement pair however, they ended up doing the same thing but worse. The replacement pair even has problems connecting to the charging port. It works for about 30 minutes or less on YouTube but with my other streaming apps it works for about 5 minutes before the sound keeps cutting out really badly. I don't know what is going on, there are so many rave reviews but I've had nothing but problems with both pairs I've gotten and tozo is no help.",2,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"I was looking for an inexpensive pair of Bluetooth earbuds to use while running and watching videos on my phone before bed. I did no research, defaulting to the tried-and-true method of finding the product in my price range with the most/best reviews. This has served well in the past, but alas, this time was a massive miss:Really, the only PRO I would bring to attention to is price, but that seems irrelevant now that I realize the ""Bluetooth Earbud Market"" is completely flooded with brands selling $50 models.",2,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"I bought these not expecting much because of the low price tag. I’ve bought many other headphones and earphones surpassing these in price. I don’t consider myself an audiophile, but I enjoy good sound and with a bunch of headphones and earphones in the bag I’ve been exposed to many different cans.These fit snug, I had trouble at work keeping in some other earbuds, they wouldn’t insulate well and was just a treble fest. These stay in and even if your ear gets sweaty they still stay in. The magnetic case is really handy, those earbuds will not fall out of the case and the hole for keychain access makes it that much better.",5,1,2019-10-19,1,1,0
"I bought this earbud along with a few others to test and this one had the best sound quality out of the bunch. All of them were in the same price range. The earbuds sound good for the price and they're fairly comfortable. I don't have a problem wearing them for an hour or so.That said, they don't seem to fit my ear all that well, or at least securely. It could be my ears though. For most earbuds, I have to use the smallest surrounds, as I have small ear holes, but for this earbud, I have to use the largest one or they will fall out really easily. When I put these earbuds in, I do the twisting action to keep them pressed against the back inner part of my ear but they will eventually slip out. I wish they were more secure, but I think it's my ear.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"Follow Up:  While my initial review stands when using the product inside, it does not work as well outside.  It appears that the connection link between the right and left earbuds is not stable and the left earbud continues to go in and out which makes the listening experience very poor.  Very disappointed with this finding and changing my initial rating from 5 star to 2  star as my main usage is outside when walking my dog at the park.  Item was returned.I was impressed with the Tozo T10 quality. Great features and pairing them to my LG Smart Phone was very easy.  The bluetooth connection was very strong.  The sound clarity of the highs and bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds.  I used my T10s for a little over three hours and they are easy to recharge with the charge case.  These are the best earbuds on the market for the price and service provided.",2,1,2019-11-22,1,1,0
"After struggling repeatedly with the Tozo T6, I “upgraded” to these T10 earbuds with hopeful wishes. I just took them out of their box for the first time, and they paired up instantly with my iPhone XR, just like the T6. The sound seems equally as rich as the T6, and these have high volume, just as the T6 had performed initially.The T6 buds lost their volume after a month of amazing sound, and my disappointment was deep when I could barely hear anything despite numerous calls with tech support.",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"This is the first set of BT earbuds I have owned. I bought them so I could listen to my music while working in the garden. My Pixel 2 does not have any place to plug in wired earbuds. For the price point, I was expecting lesser sound quality and no noise cancellation. I have not used these for calls, and it was not my main reason for buying them. The sound blew me away. My tastes are pretty eclectic, so the first thing I was listening to was Smetana, Vivaldi, Mozart, and the like. The sound quality was amazing for any that were newer, digital recordings. The material recorded from old tapes or records reflected that media. When Nelly, Kenny Rogers, NSYNC, and Larkin' Poe were playing, the sound was phenomenal. I also listen to movie soundtracks and, again, awesome based on the original media.The 4 stars are due to the same issue that many people have talked about, i.e. one or both earbuds losing connection when outdoors, the left more usually than the right. Yes, it also reduces the sound when a call or a notification comes in. I noticed that the phone in my back pocket seemed to drop the music more than a front pocket or laying on a bench no more than 10 feet away. One other thing, I do not listen to my music particularly loud, but for those who do these earbuds have no problem being loud. I have mine turned down to about 25% and the quality is still good.",4,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0
"Received wireless ear buds for Christmas, I like them but they were one size fits all almost had to hold them in place to keep them in the and not water proof. Started researching wireless ear buds on the internet. Did a search for best earbuds 2020. A list of the best ear buds for 2020 popped up with the first one being rated 10.0 out of 10.0 was the Tozo T10. Price was listed at $49.00, checked out the remaining 9 in the list and found the remaining 9 were listed any where from $149.00 -$200.00 plus. Read the reviews started with the low reviews and worked my way up. Seemed that the low reviews were from people that did not both much with reading the very short manuel, I was impressed with the manufactures reaction to those posts and the action they claimed to have taken. In addition as I moved up the star ratings I came across reviews that had been added to always adding stars not taking stars away, generally because of the responsiveness of the company addressing issues individuals had with their ear buds.Now I assure you I am not jogging, running or doing anything to test the bouncing around of the buds in the ear. I put them in walked around shock my head and had no issue with the fit. I have not tried the additional cushions, more than likely I will just to say I have but I am happy with the fit with the cushion that was already mounted.",5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0

I actually prefer the way these fit and really like the smaller charging case.  They seem to last a while between charges.  The smaller charging box makes it easier to take these in your pocket or purse. I recommend both but would order the T6 again. I WILL UPDATE IF THEY DO NOT LAST.  Appreciate this companies customer service.UPDATED 3/2020 The company reached out to me via email this week after reading my 1st review.

I did not expect them to sound this good, I had also considered a pair of much more expensive earbuds, I am glad I did not spend $100 more on a pair that surely won’t sound $100 better!The connection was super easy, fast, and reliable. No issues at all. The only thing I would like to improve would be to be able to adjust the volume on them, but then again, it might be an issue if I am using them while resting my head on them, so it’s ok.",1,1,2020-3-27,1,1,1
"There are pros and cons to these ear buds. The reviews made them sound so good, but they are average at best.The fit is pretty good - you have three size options. They stay in decently, but not always. I've had to pick one up while jogging maybe every third time. And I've learned to not do anything to jar them loose. They are pretty comfortable.",3,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"I have owned this pair of wireless earbuds for almost a year.  Just as with my previous Tozo T8, the sound is very good for wireless earbuds.  I'm no audiophile, but they have a very full and vibrant sound.  I also like the wireless charging, very convenient.  Battery life is as advertised, pairing is easy, no drop-outs.  Fit is better than average, but this is so subjective anyway.For me, the cons outweigh the pros:  It is a minor annoyance that you cannot control functions such as skipping forward or back or adjust volume as this is common on most other earbuds in this price range.  But the biggest problem I have with my earbuds, and this may just be a defect in my pair, but they do not charge in the case UNLESS the case is connected to power.  And it isn't a problem with adjusting the metal connectors.  It also seems that unless the case is being charged, the earbuds stay on, even in the case.  I find that my phone or tablet is still connected to them even in the case, so perhaps this is a defect in my pair, but just a warning in case others have the same experience.  With the plethora of earbuds on the market, I would not buy these again.",2,1,2019-12-22,1,1,0

"Wireless headphones are a very personal choice. I went through half a dozen before I settled on Tozo T10. As with any headphones, especially the ones in this price range, there are going to be negatives, and it will depend how much you weigh each of their characteristics as to how you end up liking or disliking them.Here are the reasons I like them in order of importance (to me) :",4,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
"I usually use my MPOW Jaws headphones, but they aren't safe to use in the pool. So, I bought these earbuds -- and I *love* them!  I love that I can put the earbud back in the case to charge. I love that I can set the case down on my wireless charger and the whole thing just charges. (It *also* has a port on the back of the case, if you don't have a wireless charger.)In comparison to my MPOW Jaws, the battery life of these buds isn't as spectacular -- but I expected that. I still would like to see them last a *little* longer. I knocked 2 stars off battery life because of the incredibly annoying audio that tells me to charge it -- every 20 seconds or so! Why give me a warning when it renders the device useless because of the warnings? (It makes more sounds when calls connect and disconnect, too.) I haven't stopped to see what my phone thinks the bud's battery level is, when I get the warning. (My Jaws start warning me at 30% battery remaining -- which is quite ridiculous!)",4,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
"I've been a corded-headphone holdout.

Well, I take that back- I've never seen a wireless option that did much for me AT A PRICE I thought was reasonable. Then I found these and with the coupon I think they were like $35, so for that much it was worth trying.Short version: They are surprisingly good. Even packaging is on point, which at this price you could forgive if it wasn't. The storage/charging case is very well made and the fact that it's both USB and wireless capable is pretty awesome. The earbuds snap into the case smartly via a small magnet, apparently. They pair with themselves easily and also easily with an iPhone 8.",5,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0
I just received my earbuds this morning and I jumped right into trying them on. Okay so  I followed the instructions as they are listed on how to turn the earbuds on and go to phone with bluetooth.  So make sure to turn earbuds on and them bluetooth on your phone to connect. The R earbud is the main one. They are comfortable in my ear and I didnt have to change the gel silicone ear pieces which is good but just find what works for your ears.  The only I would say is for the designers these earbuds is not to be racist about R- means Master and L means slave. Why would you even think that's correct to write in your mannuel when you have African Americans purchasing your product. Thank God we dont live in those times anymore but it still exist with some people but God!!. I'm black and was like really... so please make sure if you want to move forward with any products you make to be mindful of the terminology and history of this country when putting things in your design. It's very offputting and disturbing.  The product is good other than that so far. I will have to see what happens in a week or two. GOD bless,5,1,2020-5-1,1,1,0
"I have had these for 3-4 months. I bought them to replace a different brand of bluetooth earbuds that were less expensive but died in less than a year. I was searching for a pair that would be more robust, and chose these because of positive reviews. But functionally, these have fallen short for me. First, and most annoying, is that I cannot just use one bud at a time. Both must be off of the charger and running down battery, even when I want to keep one ear open to hear the world around me. That wasn't clear in the product description or reviews I read. Also, the range on the Bluetooth is much smaller than that of my previous pair - maybe 10 feet. Once I'm paired to my phone, if I leave the room, I lose my signal. That means I pretty much need to have my phone on me, which isn't better than wired earbuds. This was not a problem with the other brand. The sound is also a let down. I often get a delay between the two buds, so there is an echo effect. The only way to stop it is to replace the buds on their charger and reconnect. The battery life on the pair I received has certainly run down much more quickly than on the cheaper pair. I might get 3 hours without a recharge and the charger base itself needs more frequent charging. Finally, I did not find the buds comfortable - they are cumbersome and a bit heavy - and they emit an oddly bright flashing blue light. Wish I had sent them back right away instead of trying to get used to them. I'm on the hunt for a better pair now.",2,1,2020-1-16,1,1,0
"A well made, easy to use earbud pair.While I'm no audiophile and didn't expect Sennheiser over the ear sound quality in an earbud, I found the sound to be bright and clear with pronounced highs, but the sound was watery with almost no bass.  Would be worth five stars if the sound had a bit more depth and bass response.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"After using it extensively for over a month I can say that this unit is a great starter set for anyone trying out their first BT In-ear set.  Works right out of the box, no Issues pairing with a range a devices.  Given that similar sets are much more expensive and equally easy to loose, one should moderate expectations.Sound quality and noise cancellation are acceptable and though not music aficionado great.  The phone calls were clear sounding and the other end could hear clearly.  I tried it for late night movie watching and listening to podcasts while running satisfactorily.  The big con is limited battery life in continuous use sometime just a couple of hours on full charge.  They are also OK fit for my ears and I have had to look for them under furniture or retraced my steps back to a room to find the missing one (all too easy for this genre of devices). Luckily in each case I was able to find the missing piece.",4,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
Ordered these for my husband for his bday and he’s super picky with sensitive ears so I was willing to buy him expensive ones but these had such great reviews I had to give them a chance! So definitely a great  buy!! Now we hated the look and way the Apple ear pods hung down on your ear so we weren’t gonna try them but we needed quality ones which is huge for us! The moment he used them he was so happy and grateful one for comfort and two for sound. He speaks on the phone a lot and he needed these ASAP we had a bunch of the neck Bluetooth earphones but they kept breaking on us so we gave this a try. Now my husband does love them and now so do I! He also bought me a pair and I’m not a huge earphones person but I love these the quality is amazing but I did accidentally loose one and it turned up in my shorts and I was bummed but I was even more terrified when I found them after I washed clothes!!! Scary story turned greatthey still worked just as great even after a wash and dry session!!! These are so amazing in quality and price I’m begging you guys to give it a try lol!!

But I think some people are just trying to justify their purchases.  In reality they are just not loud enough for me, so I will be returning them.That being said, the sound quality is good overall.

"I’ll admit I’m fairly new to these models of Bluetooth earbuds. I’ve owned a number of models that had wires stemming from neckband or around the back of your head connections. As far as sound quality they’re not too bad. I’m assuming there are much better out there. My main issues (unresolved ) are connectivity. Typically not difficult to get to connect to a device but keeping the connection is more challenging. They seem to have good range as I’ve walked at least 20’ from my phone however they tend to cut out side to side randomly with the phone right in front of me. I road cycle and having the phone in my back jersey pocket has always been ideal. Connection however seems to be impossible for these buds from the small of my back to my ears. Very frustrating. I sent one pair back right away and Amazon was solid in sending out a replacement. Sadly, I’m beyond the point where I can return these or I certainly would. I can’t recommend these",2,1,2019-10-8,1,1,0
"Edit: I wish I'd returned these. I tried to make these more comfortable with tiny tips and ear hooks and use these but the case has never held a charge. To add insult to injury the right side won't even charge.

Also, the sound quality is amazing and has really good bass. Super easy to pair and use too.As for the surprise...! I'm not sure if my pair are part of a set that are crossing over to newer technology because my earbuds have touch control for volume and music play! Mine are the khaki. With that said, I ordered a black pair of these for my husband at the same time I ordered mine...and although everything about his and mine are the same in every way but color (model number, etc) his don't have the touch control!

Even when I'm up and moving around, the earbuds stay connected and they also stay firmly in my ears. They haven't fallen out even once.I haven't risked testing the waterproof claims, but they appear to be well made and look as if they would stand up to sweat and any rain you might encounter while wearing them. The instructions that come with them say you can wear them while swimming, just not diving, but I never use my earbuds in that kind of situation, so I don't feel like doing that just to try out the waterproof claim.",4,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"I was excited to get my first set of completely wireless earbuds. These came very nicely packaged - high end and professional - I’d say they remind me of iPhone packaging...was kind of impressed with it frankly. They were very easy to pair. At first, only the left one had blinking light. I read the instructions and it said the right one is the master so I thought it was broken. But I pressed the on/off button on the right earbud a few times and then the light came on and paired without any problems. The case is very nice, a little heavier than I expected but I hadn’t realized the case was a charger so it makes sense. Small and easy to carry around and it comes with a string should you choose to attach it to the case for transport.The earbuds came almost fully charged, and the case came half charged (2 out of 4 lights). So far I’ve been able to use the earbuds for a couple of hours without recharging. Haven’t tried longer than that. They fit well in my ears with the attached buds; haven’t tried the other sizes that came with it. I like how they are not visible when I have my hair down. I love the mobility and not having to worry about getting tangled up in the wires.",4,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"Love these! I bought these looking for something I can use specifically for showers. And this works perfect! It’s loud, a lot louder than I expected actually.

I’ve been using them for a little while and have no complaints. Well, the battery life definitely could be better. I’d say listening to them on high volume for 3hrs would kill the battery. But like I said I use for showering so I’m happy with these!Edit: also, if it’s not clear, the box the earphones come in is a charger that needs to be charged sometimes, that battery life is pretty good. I just set my earphones back in there when I’m done and when I want them again i pick them up and put them right in my ears and it immediately pairs (I keep my Bluetooth on all the time) and I like that a lot, super convenient.",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
Update 3: after my review and 1 star rating the company contacted me to offer a new updated pair of headphones. This was weeks after the bad review. They could have just left me hanging but they went above and beyond to make it right. I still wouldn’t recommend this pair but the new version is sleeker has super fast charging and has good sound quality. The sound is a little echoey but it is surround and the quality is good. Also there are more ear pads for a better fit and an 18 month warranty.Update 2: The sound quality is now horrible. I cannot hear what I'm trying to listen to. These only lasted a few months. Do yourself a favor and buy a decent pair. These are cheap and will probably die way too early.  I cannot return them and so they are in the trash.,5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"Been using for a few weeks now. I love how it stays put in my ear using the smallest ear cover because I always have trouble with this in other ear buds. Also, they are super comfortable which is another huge problem for me in other buds. The sound quality is great for price point. They are easy to use (& pair).However, here are some cons for me:",4,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0

I've never bought a pair of wireless bluetooth earbuds because I was concerned about them falling out if I was active.I decided to give-in and get some because I was tired of always being tangled up by chords or tied to my device and carrying it around.,5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"After a few days of using them, I must say I'm quite happy with the sound quality, the noise cancellation, and the battery life. They're easy to pair up to my phone and are quite comfortable to wear. The only downside was that there's not volume or playback control (i.e. skip ahead, back, etc). HOWEVER...that's something I didn't bother looking for when searching for these, so that's my bad. If you don't mind not having that sort of control, then these are a great buy! And I was surprised to find out that the case charges on a wireless pad. So if you have one, BONUS PERK! I give these 5/5 overall despite the only con I could find...and that's only because I didn't bother to read the description more. No fault of the product itself! I've decided to return these, though, and swap them out for the T6 model which DO have the functions I desire. Can't wait to get them! I'm sure I'll be just as impressed!",5,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
"I've been hunting for a pair of bluetooth earbuds for a long time. Personally, I can't justify $250 for some plastic that I may lose while on a run.I got married during the quarantine, and I realized my husband (aka my new forever roommate) probably doesn't want to listen to my audiobooks and podcasts. So, I set out to find a good, affordable pair here on Amazon.",5,1,2020-6-2,1,1,0
"UPDATED REVIEW -  I began having a problem with the right earbud not being able to work for more than about 40-minutes (max). I contacted the company TOZO and they worked with me to try and couple of different things to correct the issue - to no avail. They then sent me a replacement for the earbud and a great little usb direct charger for the earbuds. The right earbud works great. I was in the yard yesterday with the earbuds in, paired with my iPhone - I was out there for almost 4-hours working and had music (GREAT SOUND) the entire time. I don't know how long they would've lasted, but I put them back on the charger..... I'll try and complete discharge cycle to see how long they'll last, but right now - it's 4-hours of music with earbuds that stayed in my ears the entire half-day of yard work in the hot & humid Florida sun!! GREAT CUSTOMER SUPPORT. The Replacement earbud only took two days to get to me. GREAT JOB TOZO!!!Sound quality is OUTSTANDING!!! Passive noise cancellation is OUTSTANDING!! There are 5 sets of earphones - you can find the perfect set match for a great fit - which drops external noise - which also leads to fantastic bass response.",5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"I am new to the wireless headphone trend, as for most of my life (through Walkmans, Discmans, Portable MiniDisc, and MP3 players) I've always used corded headphones. I finally bought a set of budget Bluetooth earbuds that were absolutely horrible - no bass below 250Hz, and worst of all, MONO output. ""1990s dollar-store corded earbud"" sound quality. Gross! But at least the dollar-store earbuds were stereo!!!So back to my search for a set of Bluetooth earbuds with better sound and STEREO output. Being that I only would use them for a brief time period a few days a week, I didn't want to spend a ton of money. I decided to give these earbuds a chance... And I'm glad I did.",4,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
What's not to like?  The sound is great for both music and phone calls.  They have features I didn't realize they had when I bought them - a microphone for phone calls and no one I have talked to on them has complained about hearing me - you can answer phone calls and hang up by the push of a button on the side of the ear piece.  Who knew?  They paired with my iPhone X immediately and do so automatically when I take them out of their case.  Flawlessly.  Every time.  The case is a battery in and of itself.  Set the case on a wireless charger and the case battery charges and charges the ear buds at the same time. I haven't used the charging cord yet.  Not sure about battery life because I haven't had the battery go dead on me.  And I've had the ear buds out of their case for a full day and the battery wasn't an issue.  I would buy them again.,5,1,2019-11-10,1,1,0
"First off, these sound absolutely amazing with my Samsung Galaxy S9 phone when using an easy to do custom sound profile and a specific free Bass Equalizer app that I always run in the background set to vocal boost with a little bit of custom bass boost and virtualization increase.And boy do these things have utterly rich sound and based bass, without any tinny sounds or crackle to be heard. The drivers in these things are tuned to perfection.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0

"I had the T6 for about two months before I lost them. I replaced them with the T10 because they appeared newer and ""better"". However I have found them to be worse, but only mildly.The case for the T10 is less convenient and less ergonomically shaped. The T10 also has a button rather than a haptic touch sensor built into the earbud to stop sound or answer phone calls. The haptic touch was better, the only exception  being the shower. When in the shower, the water tended to activate the touch feedback and stop the sound on the T6, but not on the T10.",3,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0

"I just received my order a few days ago and for the most part so far so good. I had a easy time pairin earbuds to my devices. The only thing I did not like is that when I pair it to my Amazon fire stick I can't control the volume. It just stays on a set volume and depending on what you are watching It can be quite loud. Changing the volume didn't work with fire stick tv remote, regular tv remote didn't work also ,and the ear buds don't have a way to control the volume.👎 But when I use it with my kindle, computer or my phone I can control the volume from my devices. Volume on phone computer and kindle work when paired with the earbuds😁",4,1,2020-7-16,1,1,0
"Amazing!!! Must buy! Okay so, I purchased one set and had issues with connectivity after resetting  Reached out to the company who wanted to replace them but I mentioned I didn't like the fact it didn't have volume controls, the touch controls were strictly for phone calls. I was not used to that so I immediately and accidentally kept dialing the last number I called out of touch habit. This company sent me TWOOOO new pairs. The original one to replace and the newer model with the seek controls I requested. The bass is surprisingly loud and great. Came fully charged. These headphones last four hours on one charge and 14 with the box to fast charge. The most important thing to me was having earbuds that fit properly and these came with four different sets so the smallest ones keep these in my ears without falling out. These are water resistant so don't listen to the people who are trying to use these swimming....they're wild lol great buy one of the best purchases ive made in a while. Fantastic customer service on top of that. I can't say enough about the company or product. New customer for life. Thank you so much",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0

"I have not yet used my battery up from the initial charge I did after receiving- so its hard to give that a review other than to say I have played it multiple days hours at a time without needing to recharge. But what I can tell you, is the ease it took to set my note 10plus up with these, and they sound amazing. I have adaptive sound on due to my hearing loss- but I can get lost in the music, it is very immersive- I have some bose earphones and they sound as nice if not more bass driven then the bose.the stick-in-ear portion of the ear but is very easy on my ears so far.

"Got these to wear under my Shoei Neotec II helmet.I just received them and am testing them while wearing my helmet and sitting on the couch.

The replaceable rubber ear molds are nice, I'm currently using the biggest size to keep it snug in my ear while I put on the helmet. They are a little bit of a PITA to switch out, but not impossible.",4,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
"Let me start with reviews on this page, I read a bunch of reviews and it felt like this is the product I was looking for.I have sweaty ears.

"UPDATE: I’ve been using them the last few weeks to get a good feel for them. Unfortunately, I’m not super impressed. Which is a HUGE bummer. I love the charging case and the color, and they honestly fit well. But I discovered that the sounds quality isn’t that great, it doesn’t go up very loud and I like to jam out when I’m working out or cleaning. I also discovered that when you only wear one of the headphones you cannot turn the volume up/down with each one, the left turn it down and the right turns it up. So that’s a pain. ALSO, the “noise cancelling” only really works for myself to hear other people talking to me, it definitely doesn’t help the person I may be talking to on the phone from hearing everything that’s going on around me. So, I will be returning these and finding another option.Day they arrived - Already love them. I’ve been using the same beat up headphones for years and really wanted something truly wireless with great sound quality that was also easy to use. True test will be to see how long the battery holds up and if these headphone last for a good while. They’re so nice!",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,1
"Update:After a couple weeks of use, I can now write a more precise review of these earbuds.  The battery life of the case is way shorter than the advertised and will dischard even when not charging the earbuds.  The company promises an extended warranty plus a gift to anyone who fills out a web form and writes a review (probably the cause for so many reviews in Amazon). However, after filling out the form twice, I never got confirmation about a warranty extension or any word about the gift (a wireless charger). It is now clear to me that these promises are just a bait to people write a positive review. I am now knocking down three stars of my original review.",2,1,2020-1-26,1,2,0
"I have been using wired earbuds for years.  I finally got tired of the wires getting in the way at the gym.  I am an Andriod user and considered the Samsung ear pods but even at the $100 price point they seemed like an unnecessary luxury.  When I read other reviews for the TOZO T-10s I decided to give them a try.I've had them for only 1 day, but so far they work as advertised and I am totally satisfied with my purchase.  Buid quality is superb with good materials and quality assembly.  The battery case is magnetic both in holding the ear buds in place and the lid closure.  Nice.  Sound quality is pretty good, if a bit flat.  I downloaded an equalizer app from the Play Store and that helped me tailor the sound to my liking.  The pods are certainly plenty loud too.",5,1,2020-3-15,1,1,0
"I love these earbuds. I had this model before, but lost one. I tried a newer model, the T6, but returned it for this model again. The touch control features were too sensitive & I kept adjusting things accidentally.I have tried other earbuds, but these are the best. The sound is great. It's clear & has great bass, overall sound quality excellent. The fit is great. They have multiple ear tip sizes, like other buds. They are very secure & I never worry they will fall out or have to keep adjusting them like others. I use these for sports, so need a secure fit. The fit is unique. You put them in, then turn them to the rear & they are instantly secure. If you don't twist them, they might fall out. They do provide good sound cancellation & good sound quality while talking on the phone. I also love that they are waterproof.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"I bought this back in January so I've had a good four months of using this at this point. The battery life is still great. I can watch two movies with this on without the battery beeping on me - so I'm guessing around 3 or 4 hours of use per charge? The charging case is great to keep at hand. The earbuds are comfortable to keep on for the whole time and don't fall off for me. The noise reduction feature is still good and sound quality is generally great (see more below). The one feature I really wish it would have is the ""skip songs via click"" function or something.But that all aside, there are two problems that started a couple of weeks ago:",2,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0

"First of all I am not a techie so I really wasn't sure what to look for and became so confused.  Next step was to make a spreadsheet and compare features and that was how I began to understand (a little) what the features mean to me.  I started out buying them for my husband so I chose the TOZO 10 in black.  The earbuds come with a charging case, micro USB & a little cord or lanyard for the case I assume.  My husband did not like the feeling of the bud in his ear so I thought I would try them.  They paired so quick with my Samsung Android just like the directions said. Now I'm in love with them.  I have not used them for a phone call, I may come back and do that but I have used them everyday while streaming a tv show I can walk through the house and not be tied to a tv - I just want to listen to the show.  I have gone outside on the lanai and out into the garage and have had no problem. The case is small it is 3 5/16 inches long and has a little loop build in so you can attach it to an lanyard or keychain.  I am so completely happy with this purchase.  I will enjoy using them in the pool when I exercise out there.  We have a waterfall feature and I have to play tv (streaming through the phone) loud but not anymore.  I am so completely happy with this purchase.  I am over 70 but I'm feeling like a kid with a new toy.  The sound is excellent, I usually wear the right bud so I can hear other things around me like a pot boiling on the stove and even with one the sound is wonderful I won't be without these wireless waterproof earbuds they have given me new freedom.",5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,1
"Purchased a pair of these earbuds in August, and returned the first pair within 2-3 weeks as they seemed to constantly disconnect. The disconnect was both the Bluetooth link between phone and earbuds, and between the earbuds themselves (right is master, left is slave). The left ear would drop with almost any motion, to the point that turning my head had a pretty decent chance to make the left earbud cut out. Replaced as defective through Amazon, and the replacement pair seemed to work better for about a month, though it still cut out intermittently.The current pair has been in use daily, and it's back to the constant disconnects. Following the earbud manual and ""resyncing"" the earbuds to each other and my phone only solves the issue for a few minutes, then its back to the left ear flaking out. If I wasn't using these at a desk where my head is relatively still, these would have been replaced a while ago. Can't even walk around without them losing one of the connections (to each other, or between earbuds and phone).",2,1,2020-2-13,1,1,0

"So initially, I liked these earbuds.  The first thing I noticed was good quality sound and you had to press on the earbud to end a call (another one I had you just barely touched it, so I was constantly hanging up due to that). People did complain about sounds around me, so noise cancelling....not so much. Every once in a while static that progressively got worse as they got older.  A few days ago the right one completely stopped working.  After 3 months, I would expect more.  Very disappointed.

"i bought this earplug to use with my VR. But i found a few serious problems that make it impossible to meet my needs. First of all the buttons on these ear pieces lack critical functions, such as raise up/drop down sound levels. When i use my phone for VR, i don't have access to the phone buttons to adjust sound volume. Also it lacks next/previous functions when playing music. One extra annoying issue is pressing right ear button once will redial last phone no. which is a huge piss-off. i accidentally dialed the number i hated just because i pressed once trying to stop the music. These earplugs also are not comfortable to my ears. i have tried all sizes that come with it, none will fit comfortably for like 10 minutes. i took off the rubber part and found the stems are too long compared to another model i have. Other than those, it seems to be a OK item. But if you care about what i have mentioned, you might as well look for another product.",2,1,2019-7-11,1,1,0

I've tried different sizes of the ear piece and still no resolve. I even tried the ear piece from my old wired earpiece which fit perfectly and it still fell out. I think because of the weight of this earpiece and that fact that it doesn't have the shape to grab into your inner ear makes it fall out. I've tried twisting it into my ear, dropping my jaw to open up my ear more but it doesn't work. unfortunately i am passed the return date so i can no longer return this.

"I ordered these because of a good discount and the positive reviews.  Nothing to lose - price is low and Amazon covers everything with their amazing service.  I've been searching for the best combination of sound quality along with something that will STAY IN MY EARS when working out!  I have 2 pair of the original AirPods and they sound pretty good, but without my ""AhaStyle Silicone Hooks Covers"" they won't stay in.  I have a set of the Bose Soundsport with the wire that connects the two - they sound great and stay in my ears and the tether adds security - had them 4 years, BUT they don't work for phone calls.  I never complained to Bose.  Bought a pair of AirPods Pro and loved the noise cancellation and sound quality, but none of the 3 sizes gave me a secure fit.  Back to the store they went.  So I've looked at all the options and can't bring myself to spend $200+ in hopes of a good fit when I can use the AirPods with a cover or the Bose...but I still wanted truly wireless earbuds that will sound good and stay in my ears.  So for $35 I figured give these a shot.  So far, so good.  They sound good and so far, they stay in my ears.  We'll see how they hold up.  Looking back this review looks more like an Apple and Bose review, but my goal was to share what my reference points are so far.

"Update: After posting this review, I was contacted by the seller to amend the situation. They offered to send me a new set, with no expectation of return on the defective set. I agreed to update my review only after receiving the new pair and testing them in the same manner that the original pair was found to be defective (During strenuous activity and while doing yard work). To my surprise, they sent me their upgraded and NEWER set, the Tozo T6. I am pleasantly surprised by them. They are much smaller, more discreet, and have a better battery life than the Older and Clunkier T10's. They also do not suffer the same errors I was receiving with the T10's (Glitchy connection, intermittent cut-out, and choppy playback while doing heavy movement). I believe the issue to lie in the T10's ""Noise Cancelling"" functionality, if it helps your engineers Tozo... All in all, a spring of the extra $10 makes the T6 much more worthwhile, and I am now a happy customer.Not happy with this purchase. The sound quality sounds great, noise cancellation seems ok, but battery life leaves something to be desired.  The biggest issue for me, however, is the cutting in and out that happens constantly, with my Samsung Galaxy S8+ in my pocket 2.5 feet away from the damned things. Constant clipping, jumping, etc, even when standing still. Forget about it if you're moving, it would probably be enough to cause a seizure. Waste of 50 bucks",4,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0
"Not as good as I had hoped based on previous reviews.  They sometimes do not connect or when they do there is a lot of static.

Sometimes I try to restart and it works, other times it remains.Tried with other phones with same result. They fit OK (another reason I purchased as other earbuds don't fit well).  If these were a bit higher quality in sound and functioning for phone calls I would be extremely pleased.  Current product needs improvement.

"These are small, which I like.  The sound is great and I'm glad that I can sweat and not have to worry about them. You cannot swim in them, which seems a no-brainer as they would probably fall out anyway.  I especially like that I can use just one, since I have a hearing aid in the other ear.  The battery case is small and seems to be well built.  I can easily slip it into my pocket or purse.  I have small ear canals and have to use the smallest earcaps, but they seem to be pretty secure in my ear.  They came with a partial charge so I was able to use them immediately and try them out.  My only complaint is that I have trouble controlling volume and power, but I'm not used to anything like this, so I am learning.  I think part of the problem there was that I tried the left one first (my weak ear) and didn't hear the ""primary"" vocal indication.  The next time, I took the right one out of the case first and that became the ""primary"" earbud.  That made it a bit easier to control.  These are so much better than ear buds with a cord.  I've not tried them when talking on the  phone yet.  Sorry.",4,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0

My husband and I purchased the same exact ear buds but he seemed to receive a more updated pair.I have to literally, jam the ear bud up into my ear in order to push the buttons hard enough to work them. While my husbands pair is touch, and you barely have to at that, mine have an actual button to push that you can hear clicking. I'm really not happy about that. The only other difference between the two are the color. I'm also a bit disappointed in the volume however, I understand why they do not get louder.",4,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0

"Update: I’m updating this review for Tozo’s spectacular customer service. They reached out to me to attempt to rectify the situation. Ultimately, resulting in my money back. Although the headphones didn’t work out for me, it’s better to take a chance with a company that cares about your satisfaction over the dollar.I brought these headphones because I wanted to a pair of swim proof earbuds. They are definitely waterproof but they are 100% against working with each other. I paired them together out the box immediately and one day they just unpaired. Despite how many times I reset them they will not pair together. I even let the charging case and the individual buds die out before I tried again. Again, to no avail. I've noticed this is a problem for lots of other people. Lastly, these earbuds do not fit in my ears. Even using the smallest ear piece they will sky rocket out of my ear (I had to stop taking them outside because of this). Now I have two single earbuds that do not work together or stay in my ears.

But also, I was just thinking you overpay for the brand name of so many products like that and I was on a budget. Soo.... (read below)My budget range was anywhere from $50-$100, depending on the quality and if it was worth it. These earbuds were just under $50, and I am so glad I bought these to be honest. I ride a motorcycle with them in my ears for music, and they stay in the ears really well while you're moving. The noise cancellation is great. I don't have them so loud that I can't hear traffic of course, but I can still get a super nice bass and sound out of them even while riding a motorcycle, if that tells you anything.",5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"I previously had another pair of wireless earbuds, but none of the provided caps fit my ear canal (I've always had trouble finding earbuds that weren't uncomfortable after 5 minutes of use). They were OK, but lost sync and skipped frequently, even though the phone was strapped to my arm, enough to warrant looking for a different solution.I gave the T10 a whril after a friend recommended them. They've been a great step up. The sound is better, the shape of them fits my wonky ears a lot better and more comfortably, and I haven't had any issues with the Bluetooth crapping out on me mid-song.",5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
I've only been using for a few hours so jury is out on any time-dependent performance items... but here are some initial impressions:Pairing:  Pairing (to ipod) was remarkably simple.  Literally took a few seconds following instructions right at top of package (per the instructions be sure to select  TOZO-T10-R not -L on the device since both will appear).  I've never had such a simple bluetooth experience.,5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
Very Impressed!I’m an audiophile who purchased these for my wife because she didn’t want wired over her neck or hooks on her ears.,5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"The earbuds are wireless charged through the included charging case. The charging case can also be wireless charged through an external, sold separately, wireless charging pad. My favorite feature is when I remove the earbuds from the case they automatically connect to each other and to my phone. The one downside is that battery life is about 2 hours. I have had bluetooth earbuds last 4+ hours. Then again, it's probably not good for your ears to listen to music that long. For the price, these are really good wireless earbuds!I haven't tested the waterproof/sweatproof feature thoroughly. In the past, most of my earbuds have failed due to sweat entering the earbuds. I wouldn't be surprised if these fail in the long run, but that's ok since they have good customer support and will refund/replace your purchase. You have to be within the warranty year limit though.",2,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"I really want to give these a higher rating, but I just can’t.... As other reviewers have mentioned, the connection cuts out if I’m not within about 10-12 inches of my device, which really defeats the purpose of the ear buds. So really, I have to hold my phone near my head while I’m using the buds. And don’t even get me started on when I turn my head slightly. The comfort is excellent, though (especially compared to the earphones that come with the cell phones), and I like that the product came with a few different sized cushions for my ears. It’s nice for when I want to wear them while laying down. The sound quality is also very good. Just wish it worked better so I didn’t also have to lug around my phone or device in order to use them. I haven’t tested them out with water at all, so I can’t rate them on that factor. Overall, I can’t flat out give a strong  recommendation on these, but for what it is, I have been able to “make it work”, though not to my full satisfaction.",3,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"I originally bought these to connect to a bluetooth transmitter.  The volume was too loud, so without volume controls on the earbuds, this was a problem.  Also, the volume controls on the transmitter did not work on them.  So I had to buy another set (that has volume controls) and use this on a Windows tablet, where I can control the volume. But, say I'm watching videos on Youtube, the first one sounds fine, but as soon as I start another video I get TONS of noise.  I have to turn bluetoon off and on to resolve.Revised: After reviewing this, kudos to the seller, who replaced these with a T6, which is a much better unit.  I hooked those up to the tablet; they work flawlessly, sound great and have volume controls on the earbuds.  The T10s are not connected to a notebook, and they work, but the noise problem slightly remains: when they've been inactive for a bit, if I start a new video, there's a split second of noise but then normal sound continues, so it depends on the device.  Both tablet and notebook are Windows 10, so you might have luck with another type of device, but I'd recommend going with the T6 instead.",2,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"These are an upgrade from my other wire-connected wireless headphones. The sound quality is better and the range seems to be better as well. With my old ones, for some reason they could work with me being in another room, but it would stutter when my phone was in my left pants pocket. I have noticed an occasional mus c sk p on th se he d h nes, but it may have been my connection switching from wireless to phone data. More testing is needed on this front which may change my rating later.The other things I will mention are they battery life seems to be shorter than my past wire-connected headphones, but charging them quickly with the case is nice so it's not that big of a deal. Also, there are no volume controls nor controls to skip a song track; there is only the option to play/pause and redial/answer/hang up a phone call. This was my fault for not noticing the lack of these features in the description (I looked at several brands and must've got confused) so this does not affect my rating.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"Update 2: TOZO has contacted me several times since sending me the new set of T6 earbuds as a replacement. They want me to remove or change this review. I've explained several times that doing so would violate Amazon's review guidelines. However, I again today received yet another request, so in making sure that you the reader knows that while if you receive a broken or defective set TOZO will step up, they also want to buy good reviews.Update: After seeing this review, Tozo contacted me to address my displeasure. They have offered to send me the upgraded version of the earbuds, or refund my money. I am taking them up on the offer of the upgrade. For what these cost I kind of expected some technical issues, but want to be sure that my review also shows that they didn't and want to make the customer happy. So while the product review will stay the same, I will give the effort by them a huge plus.",3,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
"These earbuds provide all of  the features that I was looking for at an excellent price.  I enjoy a nice deep bass without losing the highs and mids and that's exactly what these buds deliver. They also push out plenty of volume.They are light, comfortable and fit securely in my ears. I have tried many others that either won't stay in my ears or are uncomfortable. The Tozo T10 buds provide just the right fit and include 3 sets of silicone tips so you're sure to find a comfortable fit.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,1,0
"1/22/19 these no longer hold a charge just sitting in my purse. I’ve only used them maybe 15 times max since I bought them, usually they just sit in my purse. The last 5 times (3 times in the last week and a half) I’ve gone to use them the battery in the case and earbuds have been dead. Every time I’ve charged the battery to full and I go to use them the next time and the battery is dead again. Maybe I just have a faulty battery but I don’t think I would suggest buying them.November 2019: So far they’re great! They actually stay in my tiny ears. I’ve never been able to use apple earbuds because they’re too big and hard painful plastic. These stay in very well. They slip out a little bit with sweat, but I think that’s pretty unavoidable. I used them all day yesterday and the battery was still charged, and the sound quality was very good.",2,1,2019-10-15,1,1,0
"Update:  Apparently the only time I get a response from the company is when I teview the product.  They sent me an email with instructions to reset them and they still don’t work well.  I would like a refund but at the very least, I won’t be buying this brand again and hopefully nobody else will, either.  My left side still blips in and out and the closest people to me are at least 20 ft away so I don’t think it’s other wireless interference.  Plus, my phone is quite literally only a foot away from my head on the top of the treadmill. Don’t buy this brand.Original review:",1,1,2019-12-9,1,1,0
"I did a lot of research and went through probably 30 printed and video reviews and settled on these.  I can say that the reviews were right.  These are awesome.  Crystal clear sound quality, great base and no distortion at full volume.  Music, talk radio, calls, all great clarity.  Battery life is as described, 4 hours plus.  Earpieces are durable and you get many sizes for custom fit.  Charging box is very durable and features strong magnetic closure and water proof USB port.  Also supports wireless charging which also works well.  I was really on the fence of whether to spend another $40-$50 for Raycon buds, but glad I saved the extra $ as these satisfy all of my demands in quality and sound.",5,1,2020-4-10,1,1,0
"I am not entirely sure how long these things are meant to last, usually a pair of wired headphones can last me anywhere from 2-3 years depending how quickly I wear them down or lose them but these things were not exactly cheap, they are going at a solid 50.00$ dollars plus whatever tax is added in there, that's almost five times the amount I pay for a pair of headphones on any normal day and last for about 1/5 as much.I got these 6 months ago and they are already starting to show quite a bit of problems, there battery does not hold, they have constant issues connecting and what's more they have a frequent issue where they do not connect properly to my phone anymore.",2,1,2019-12-11,1,1,0
I was hoping these head phones would be great replacement for what I have but they are not left ear bud goes in and out and before anyone says any thing this happens with the phone a foot away from me on a table even in my hands but when it is not cutting In and out they sound amazing I just wished it the left worked and wouldn’t cut out at all,3,1,2018-12-17,1,6,0
"I have only had these for three days but I am impressed. They arrived quickly, ahead of the scheduled. I purchased them specifically for my Kindle. They paired easily and quickly. With both on there was no outside interference. I switched to one ear and the sound was great. I listened for about an hour and then put them in to charge. When I checked an hour later they were fully charged. I decided to use them with my iPhone. Again they paired immediately. I have thr Kindle app on my phone and they worked great with my Audible app. I decided I would pair them with my iPad. Again success.I have purchases a second set for my wife. I have been using them constantly. I always kept my iPad on silent but now I can listen without bothering my wife. I have recommended them to my friends and I am learning how to use them individually to extend my listening time. They charge quickly and the battery life is great.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"I know there are so many options out there for these kinds of earbuds, so I don't know how good others are, but I just wanted to leave my review for these ones. They connect quickly, they have deep bass and good sound, long-range of connection (you can leave your phone in your backpack while you work out and still get a signal. I accidentally left in my jean pocket and one of the earbuds was washed and dried and it's still working great.",5,1,2020-10-4,1,2,0
"I have had these earbuds for a few months now and feel like a review is now valid. At first, I LOVED them. They were reliable, held a charge, worked like they should and the sound quality was great.Now that I have had them for about 6 months, I am already looking at buying another pair and throwing these away. The issue I have is that the battery life is trash. And they will show fully charged and then 10 minutes into using them, they are dead. The other issue, and it's a pretty big deal, is that they loose connectivity ALL THE TIME. No exaggeration. I have been using them a lot now that I am working remotely but i'll connect them to my devices to use for conference calls and without fail, they will disconnect from whatever device I am using within ten minutes. It doesn't matter if it's my laptop, my iPhone or my Pixel phone that I am using. I have tried everything I know to do to make this not happen but I think it's just the earbuds. I am disappointed that I spent the money on these and only got 6 months out of them but then again, I should have spent a few bucks more to get a better quality product in the first place.",2,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
"I am one who must be listening to something while I work -- music, old TV shows, whatever. It is ""white noise"" for me as I concentrate on the job at hand.  These earbuds have freed me away from my tablet as I can walk a fair distance away from the tablet and still pick up the signal.  (15' maybe?)They fit in my ear, and stay, even when I sweat.  However, there is one major flaw I hope they will work on -- the left earbud cannot work without the right earbud!  I listen ALL DAY.  The batteries last between 4-5 hours, if I am remembering correctly.  Great, I thought; I'll use the right earbud and when it dies I'll use the left earbud.  IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.  To use the left earbud only, the right earbud must be laying on top of the recharge case, so it is draining its battery the whole time the left earbud is being used.  (My husband is handicapped so I need to keep one ear open to hear him talking to me.) This set is practically perfect, but I do wish they were not rigged to work only out of the charger.",4,1,2019-5-2,1,1,0
Update: now one earbud is stuck under the stove fitting after it yet again fell out of my ear. I will have to dismantle the woodwork to go fetch it. *If* I can retrieve it. I’m giving them to my son and stopping this reign of terror. I just wanted some earbuds. Was that too much to ask?****,3,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"At first I was weary if these would fit my ears, but the 4 different sizes make for a great customized fit. I have used these in the gym and on runs and they stay in your ear. Ear size does matter as it may be hard to fit everyones ears, but the medium size fit my ears perfectly. The sound quality is good, but not Bose or Beats level good, which is expected as they are a 5th the price ($32.99). The sound quality is good enough for me and has a good amount of bass as well. The battery level is definitely at or above the 3 hour level. I really don't know the limit, because around 3 hours is the max time I have used them for, but I did not get a low battery warning at the point. The case does seem to fully charge the ear buds at about 3 times on a full charge. I have had no problems with pairing them to my phine and everytime I pull them out the case they sync up with eachother and them to my phone no problem. The only downside I name with the earbuds is that there is no volume control or song skip function on the earbuds, and the button is a little firm to press. Other than that they are great for the price you pay, plus they are IPX68 rated too. All in all, these were a great purchase in my book.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
I bought the T10 earbuds to watch TV and stream movies late at night so I wouldn't disturb others in the room.  When I change the stations on the TV some stations start off where the voices are distorted with a crackling sound for a few seconds then sounds okay. This is really irritating. Then I discovered that there is no volume control on the earbuds.  I cannot control the volume from the TV for the earbuds.  The description on the webpage for the Tozo T10 does NOT mention that there are no volume controls on the earbuds.  Buyer beware....this earbud is not made for watching TV shows.  I'm going to look for a better earbud from another manufacturer.,1,1,2020-7-15,1,1,0
"I decided to move up to bluetooth ear buds because I was tired of cord tangling & gave Tozo a try. When these came in the mail I tried them out & was disappointed as the sound & bass were weak at first but then I saw these have bigger sized ear pads, switched to the ones that fit my ear the best & the difference was nite & day.  Immediately after I found the correct orientation to wear these on my ear I found these had strong bass with good mids/highs for ear buds, I love these buds now.  Very comfortable to wear, use these to bike ride with no problems. I would say these are comparable to my Skullcandy Ink'd wired buds bass & sound wise but with better noise cancellation than the Skullcandy so I can enjoy my music more without hearing much outside noise. These are good enough for my purposes & would buy again",4,1,2020-3-6,1,1,0
"It’s a mixed bag of stuff. Visually appealing. The connection protocol is odd. The buttons are a push to click, which kinda pushes the buds further into the ear. The rich bass isn’t uniform across all selection where you expect bass and I guess it’s too much trouble or cost to get a proper translation for some of the instructions, and I’ve had the buds to intermittently desync from my phone and or each other, and it will not sync to my tablet. Odd stuff. I was afforded the chance to review the t6..the improved model over the t10. Briefly, it does address concerns I had over the previous model. The bass is improved, the controls are touch/tap sensitive as opposed to a hard button click and it syncs to my tablet. The buds have removable earbuds to ensure a good fit. The sound isolation is much like Sony buds I’ve used in the past. It seals out most sound for listening quality, but does not afford easy listening if someone starts talking and does well for calls, albeit with a slight muffled effect...not detrimental, just there. Overall, aside from Sony, these buds provide a good listening experience at a fraction of the cost of iPods. They’re supposed to be waterproof,(I hadn’t tested that yet). If your interested, I’d skip right past the t10 and go for the t6. Did I mention they give you a warranty extension for free(18 months)",2,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"I have mixed feelings about these earbuds. I bought them 2.5 months ago. I was really happy with them at first. They charge easily, utilizing a wireless charger and come with a portable charging case. The sound quality is decent, but in no way are they noise canceling. I bought them for the fact that they are noise canceling, as I have very loud flatmates and these days I work from home most of the time. If you are walking or jogging they also fall out of your ears very easily.About three weeks ago the right earbud stopped syncing with the left earbud on my phone. And shortly after that, the battery in the right earbud died completely. I contacted Amazon tech and they went through some troubleshooting tutorials with me. None of them worked. I then contacted the manufacturer and they followed with the same troubleshooting techniques. The customer service was very patient, and helpful. They stand by their product. Never the less, the issue was not resolved. They have stated that they are sending a new pair, free of charge to replace the old ones that I have. Unfortunately, they are coming from China. The last three items I have ordered from China never arrived or arrived four months later. So this does not really help the fact that I need them now.",3,1,2020-8-18,1,0,1
"The sound from these, when fitted with the proper ear gels is very isolating and emphasizes the low end. This is preferred, imo, overall to headphones that are too flat in sound. When outdoors and commuting bass does not get lost and the outside world does not intrude uneccesarily. Top marks for sound quality!Othewise, the ergonomics on these are questionable. The left and right earpieces are exactly the same shape. This means instead of ""tucking in"" next to your ears when they are inserted, they stick out. For me, this seems like a cost-cutting measure. This makes them more likely to fall out because they don't rest on your ear cartilage as much and, for what it's worth, look more nerdy.",4,1,2019-4-6,1,1,0
"Great earbuds when they work. I bought 3 sets. One for me, my wife and my brother. Thankfully mine are still working but my wife’s ran into the dreaded problem of the left earbud refusing to do a factory reset or pair with the other earbud. Tried everything in their manual as well as all the troubleshooting suggestions on the product page by other users and after 2 hours of screwing these I just want to throw them away because my return period just expired. For spending so much money I expected to get a longer use out of them or at least have a failure for a different reason than just pairing problems. I’d suggest moving on and getting a different set unless you feel lucky.  Hoping my other set lasts longer....",1,1,2020-2-1,1,2,0
"I like these so much that I've bought 2 pairs. Great sound and really easy to use. Tip: follow directions...put in ear upside down and rotate clockwise up. Trust me this works! I was getting pretty annoyed when they kept falling out...on my second pair I saw the directions on a sheet right on top and it's amazing how different they feel and sound when you put them in right! Also try all the included tips. For me I like the largest ones and here I thought I had dainty ears! 😂 I walk and listen to books. I've found these to be easy to use and transfer to calls when necessary. Truly you just pick them up out of the case and they pair with your device. There's a button on the earpiece that allows you to accept phone calls easily. One last bonus...when you get the ""battery low"" message, you just put them in their case to charge which means you can charge on the go. I honestly didn't expect to get all these features at this price point,  which makes them a steal. I recommend buying at least one pair now!",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
GREAT. LITTLE EARBUDS! 👍🏼😊. I had tried another brand that looked like the Apple earbuds but they hurt my ears because they were very hard plastic and didn’t fit my ears comfortably.  I tried every way I knew to make those work and fit but was never satisfied.  As luck would have it they QUIT!!  I hadn’t had them very long so I’m glad they quit within a time frame that I could send them back.  Now I was on another quest to find the perfect earbuds.  I read tons of reviews and was impressed with what I read with these earbuds.  The thing that truly sold me to try them was the fact that the earpiece was soft and 3 sizes!!!  Amazing!!!  I decided to give them a try and have been very pleased so far.  I needed the smallest earpiece for a PERFECT fit!  Now for the sound quality.  It is also perfect in my opinion.  It connected very easily to my ipad and now it automatically connects each time I use them.  The case is a nice size and holds a good charge.  Haven’t tested how long the charge lasts but happy so far.  I decided to buy the extended warranty to insure my little earbuds.  I have received correspondence from the company wanting to know how I liked their product.  I give their customer service a big round of applause  👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 In a day when customer service is almost a thing of the past.  I highly recommend these little earbuds.  I know you will enjoy them!!,5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
Update...When using both earbuds in stereo audio goes in and out of both buds... the left earbud loses audio extremely frequently to the point where that is what I'm focusing on instead of the music and zoning out working.,3,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0

"UPDATE: 8/26/2020 - While the headphones allow me to listen to music and take calls while I am walking in the morning, I have been dissappointed that I have never been able to use the wireless charging function.  I have tried several different charging ""plates"" over the past year, including one from TOZO, but the case will not charge except with the usb cord.  While I have tolerated this over the past year, I do feel the need to make sure others know of this discrepency. The initial review was based on the earbuds themselves.  For a basic music listener, they seem fine, but I will admit over the past year that they do disconnect from my phone, but then reconnect.  The battery life has been okay.  I can get about a 3.5 hours out of a charge. They buds are a little bulky, but not horrible.  I did use my own size earbud tips as the ones that came with it were all too large.These are incredible! I bought these headphones to replace a different brand of earbuds that stopped functioning.  The earbuds arrived quickly and in a great carrying case. They pair with each other quickly and then quickly pair with my phone.  The sound quality is incredibly clear with a rich sound.  The base is very strong.  The noise blocking feature is an added bonus, I hear very little environmental noise while outside.  These will be great for my next flight.  Customer service has been superb, checking to make sure I am satisfied with my purchase, unusual in today’s world.  I would recommend these to anyone looking to buy a good quality affordable pair of earbuds.",2,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
"Initial impression of these is very good. They came very well packaged and were easy to setup, didn't even utilize the instructions as it was ""so easy a caveman could do it."" Sound was clear and plenty loud enough. I called my brother as soon as I got them (while connected to them to test the microphone) and he said I sounded loud and clear; very happy with that because I mostly bought them to talk on the phone while driving. So far I couldn't be happier with them. I opted for these over the touch sensitive ones and am glad I did. I didn't realize it until I received them but the ""face"" of these presses/clicks in and can be used to pause, answer, skip, and end calls/music, nice feature to have although I'd still be completely satisfied if they didn't have this feature. Can't be beat for the price!Edit 9/3/2020:",3,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
I bought these earbuds after a construction project was started next to my home where I also now work.  I was looking for something that I could move around in & to help cancel out the noise. These are great for both purposes. I was really impressed by how easy it was to pair these to my the blue tooth on my phone or computer. You literally just take them out of the case & they are good to go.  They stay connected no matter where I am in the house as well with no drops or loss of signal at all so far & the sound quality is pretty decent.  I deducted one star bc the touch controls are a little wonky.  Its easy to tap either earbud once to pause or resume what is playing but using the multiple taps that are supposed to do other things is hit or miss.  I.e trying to change the volume may result in a disconnect or a skip forward or backward..etc..  Not a deal breaker for what I use them for but something that could be improved.,4,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
I bought a pair of raycon earbuds for more than double the price. The ray cons do have a lower profile meaning they don't stick out at the ear as much. I also feel like they would be less likely to come out if I were working out.However the case for the raycons doesn't charge the earbuds and they do not have as good a range as these do.,5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"The unfortunate problem I encountered with these earbuds was that they would constantly lose connection with whatever I had them paired with. Even if it were just my phone in my pocket, my music or podcast would intermittently stop. This would happen pretty frequently, too, making for a rather annoying experience. The sound quality was actually pretty good, but again, the bluetooth capabilities were not great. The battery seemed to drain rather fast, too. These should be more accurately priced around $20 in my opinion.EDIT* - I have been contacted by TOZO and they are offering to replace the earbuds at no expense to me. The customer service has been very accommodating, and if the new earbuds arrive in working condition I will gladly give them 5 stars.",3,1,2019-9-7,1,2,0

These previous models had fairly low sound quality but I used them mainly to workout or have a mic to talk on the phone.The algorithm brought me here, I had no intention of looking for or buying bluetooth earbuds. I have small ears and perform exercises with a lot of up and down motions like running, group classes, etc, so I assumed these would fall out.

"Initial Reaction is very positive for the price. I was not really expecting much for $30 something wireless headphones but it feels quality. Both the case has decent magnets that the headphones and the case cover get closed properly which I personally find oddly satisfying. The case may be rather large compared to airpods but I have large pockets so I do not have much of a problem with it. As for the fit, I have strange ear shapes but I can use the smallest rubber part to make it stay in my ears. You can do a fair amount of things without them falling out, but possibly do to my strange ears they tend to fall out when i bend over too far. However, they stay when I shake my head so they should be good for moderate exercise or work activities. The battery in the headphones lasts about 3-4 hours on my first test. Kind of low in my opinion but not unexpected. You can tell its dying because these are the type that keep cutting out when low battery. The sound quality is much better than I was honestly expecting, I can feel the base on some songs for sure. Honestly surprised with the overall quality for the price.",5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"Update 5/13/20 The buds work very good and deliver great bass, the best bass of any earbuds I’ve tried. Unfortunately I have found that when I go to press the air buds, either to push in to my ear a little tighter or to pause and unpause, the sound cuts out a little in one ear. If I just touch the basing of one bud, the sound disappears in one of the buds for just a second. The sound also has started cutting out depending on which way my head is turned while wearing them. I decided that the cutting out was not worth the extremely good bass and returned them.So far so good! I bought these due to some other wireless earbuds losing their charge and not living up to their reported use time. So far I find the sound quality on these to be greater than those previous ones. These appear to have some really strong bass as well! Surprising to hear in such small buds. As long as the battery life holds out over the next year I am goin to be beyond satisfied. The case is very nice as well, feels very solid, with a hinged too that snaps shut very securely. Well worth the purchase!",5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
I waited 3 months to write this review. I really wanted to like these. When they got delivered they looked great. Charging case felt sturdy and well constructed. Between the sleek look and the great price the seemed too good to be true.....unfortunately they are. The large size of the electronics compared to the earbud create a counter balance issue that makes keeping these in your ears while seated near impossible. You can forget about moving around in these. The Bluetooth connection is also terrible. If you sit still it’s great but turn your head left to right with your phone in your pocket and it drops out. Even taking a walk it’s basically unusable. I was looking for a good pair of headphones on a budget but I’ve learned why wireless earbuds are so expensive. You definitely get what you pay for. Buyer beware.,2,1,2020-2-5,1,1,0
"First attempt: purchased the color called “khaki” bc in the photo it looked like it was more of a rose gold. Nope. It’s like the Suntan colored pantyhose my grandmother wore. Returned without even attempting to use.Second attempt: ordered in black. Those looked better so I tried to put them to use. Pairing with my iPhone 11pro was more difficult than expected but really only took a few minutes. (Odd that it attempts to pair both headphones separately but the directions explicitly tell you to pair R only!?) But then I realized that you can only play/pause audio with the controls, can’t advance or go back. I use this feature ALL the time and I can’t let that go. Shame on me, it’s right there in the Q&A, I just didn’t see it. Worse still, if you do accidentally double tap in an attempt to advance (like most earbuds) it will callback your most recent call. I accidentally ended up ringing my neighbor and I can see myself doing that time and again. I’ll keep these and gift them to my daughter for Christmas. She’s never had a pair and wouldn’t be accustomed to skipping tracks by double-tap, so she wouldn’t know what she’s missing. If not for her, these would be going back.",2,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"The issue was I only had them a couple of days and the audio seem to get worse.  I also noticed the voice call audio was not great.  I did notice a review where they had great customer service, well the emails are not valid so don't expect a warranty replacement either.  All in all I think you may find a diamond in the rough with these they are not too bad.  I just see the quality of the manufacturing is off, some get good ones and some do not.  I am not taking a chance again although worth the price of experiment.  Also they do call out a 18 month warranty, that's fine when you can't contact them because the emails are invalid.",2,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0
"Edit: After a few months of ownership, these ear buds turn off on their own. It's actually very frustrating. The sound quality is still great when they work. However, I would not buy these again.Original Review: As of late, I've been using some other Bluetooth headphones whose earpieces are connected by a wire. The sound quality was fine, but the cord connected the ear pieces kept getting in my way whenever I needed to do anything other than breathe. So, I started looking for some truly wireless earbuds and found these. I checked the reviews and saw they were predominantly positive, so figured I could give them a try.",2,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
These headphones were great while they lasted. I had them for 4 months and were charging great but the one time I charge them in the car they never worked right again. The charging lights wouldn’t light up indicating it was charging so I tried to power on by clicking the button that worked but the battery never fully charges again. I’ll use the earbuds for not even a minute and then the battery dies. Also the earbuds started getting hot while “charging” in the case. Also I’ll wear these walking or cutting the grass and when I go to twist my body the buds will cut out. Will be buying a different brand this time.,3,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
"If you are using for listening to music/podcasts on Android, these are fantastic. I can't imagine the sound being any better. They fit snug in your ear, yet stand out enough for visibility of others, without looking like a drip of ""you know what"" coming from your ear (apple pods).Tip on Android: Start your preferred source of music then > Open GooglePlay Music > Click settings > click Equalizer > click Equalizer again > pick your sound profile. (I found that jazz has the most bass for rock/pop/hip hop music)",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"These are by-far the best sounding truly wireless ear buds I have used! The most important key here is to try out and determine which ear tips fit you the best - in some cases you may find that one ear needs a different size than the other for proper fit - luckily the manufacturer includes 4 different sized sets of tips!  Once properly fitted, I found the sound from these to be awesome! Great bass, clear highs and midrange, and a surprisingly wide sound-stage presence, given the low price!Battery life is realistically about 3 hours before recharge, which is perfectly fine for ear buds in this price range. The recharge carrying case holds enough power for several recharges, so with the ear buds and case you can go all day! I had no problems pairing with my Samsung Galaxy S10+ phone. I’ve successfully used them without interruption or static when the phone was left in another room on the opposite side of my house.",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"My 4-year old ruined my phone's built in speakers by dumping bubbles onto it.  But, all in all, the phone sill works great, which put me in the market for some wireless earbuds.  I didn't want to spend much as I never owned a set before and I wanted to make sure they'd work for me.  These came highly rated, so I decided to give them a try.  First impressions:  I was impressed with the overall build quality of the charging case and buds.  They were not difficult to pair and the sound quality was decent enough for phone calls and listening to podcasts while pretending to work.  Well, that lasted about 1 week until all of a sudden the right bud's ""system on"" audible notification voice became high-pitched and the unit refused to connect.  Thank goodness they connect independently.  I still have one that connects and I plan to use it until it fails, then buy a different set from a different brand.  Pros: cheap, can use independently, good entry-level bud for testing. Cons: unreliable, cuts in and out unless your phone is in the same side pocket as your ear, you have to press hard on the bud to activate functions like answer call and redial number.  This is painful for my ear.  Lesson learned:",2,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"I bought this product after becoming intrigued at the prospect of completely wireless earbuds, with a case that was capable of charging. I spend a lot of time on my phone, between listening to audio and making and answering phone calls while working from home. The addition of the waterproof factor was also something that was really interesting to me, since I do run and get caught in the rain sometimes.While I'm still impressed with the audio quality and waterproof factor, I did run into a few annoyances once trying these out, which make be dealbreakers for other buyers. While you can start and stop audio or calls using the buttons on the units, you cannot control volume at all, unless you do so on your phone. I also found that call quality was TERRIBLE, and those I was talking to on the phone often couldn't understand me. The earbuds were also often slow to connect to Bluetooth - I even had to place them back in the case and remove them again to ""restart"" the pairing process a time or two. Battery life was shorter than some of my other bluetooth earbud units, but still long enough for a good run and a few hours of around-the-house listening.",4,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0

"Sure its fantastic to have a Truly wireless set of headphones at 50 bucks.  However I am at a loss how it has this crazy of a review base.  I got them fitting right,  sure they have some bass for what seems like a bigger than most driver.  Its not ultra clear,  noise cancellation is buggy at best,  and there is an audible hum at high volumes.I'm impressed cheap headphones sound this good last day of 2019 but I'm not mind blown by the quality here.  I'd put them on par with the 30 dollar wired pixel buds that came with my Pixel 3 XL.",2,1,2019-12-31,1,1,0
"Sound quality was fine and pairing was as easy as it is with any BT 5.0 earbuds, however it uses the right ear bud as the master. My left earbud kept going dropping despite my best efforts.Earbuds felt fine for the time I had it and they give you a lot of options for rubber tips. However the mic and thus the voice quality isn't good. It's clear but it's super quiet. Tried them on 4 different phones just in case and they all sounded the same. Clear voice but super low volume.",2,1,2019-12-29,1,1,0
"How disappointing!With over 14k reviews and 4.5 Star rating, it was based on those reviews and that rating that I purchased these earbuds. So unless I got a lemon those reviews are either misleading or expectations of a product are very low.",2,1,2019-10-31,1,0,1
"First let me say I paid for these, this is an honest review after having them a week. Now down to business...My bf has a different brand that is popular here and they are pretty decent. I decided to get these over the very expensive “fruit” brand. We wanted to see which ones were better. I think I won with these. I’ve been really impressed with them.",4,1,2019-7-5,1,0,1
"They fit great, the battery life was good and they sounded fine... But the signal would drop constantly. I'm pretty sure that most of the issue was caused by interference from other Bluetooth devices within about 10 feet. For example, I'd have terrible connectivity problems if I had my Fitbit Charge 2 on my wrist. It would get worse if I raised my hand above chest level and got it more than about 18 inches from the headphones. I'd get pretty good connections if I was alone in my house, but forget about walking around outside or in an office setting. I live in San Francisco, and the streets are crowded with tons of people - and I noticed that if anyone with iPhone Bluetooth ear buds got within about 10-feet of me, I'd lose first the left ear, then the right. It would clear up about 3 seconds later after I'd passed the 20-foot mark away from the other Bluetooth user. This left me feeling certain that the problem was with interference from other Bluetooth devices. For the way I intended to use these earphones, that just wouldn't cut it. I've returned them after two weeks of trying to make them work and I'll be replacing them with something else.",2,1,2019-3-21,1,1,0
"So far so good. I haven't had these for too long but the case and the earbuds are high quality. They're made of hard plastics and they feel durable. The included accessories are nice, including ear pieces and USB cable. The multiple ear pieces ensure a perfect and comfortable fit. The initial pairing was super easy. The sound quality is great. I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile, but I feel I have a bit of a picky ear when it comes to sound quality. I think these sound great for ear buds and especially for this price range. I haven't been able to test the battery life well enough yet so can't speak much to that. I have had one maybe two problems. My MacBook Pro has a hard time staying connected via BlueTooth. Every several minutes I'll quickly and briefly loose my connection, and it connects right back up. It's fairly consistent. Also, the mic doesn't work on my MacBook Pro. When I try to select my Tozos under Sound Preferences my computer freezes a bit and my Tozos disconnect. I didn't remove any stars for these issues yet because I haven't contacted support yet. I'll come back and update based on my experience. I don't get the same disconnect and reconnect issue on my iPhone so it's possible the issue is on my MacBook.",4,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"I've owned both the Tozo T6 and T10 Bluetooth headphones. I went with the T10 because I lost one of the buds to the T6 earbuds. Compared to the T6, the sound quality on the T10 is stellar. Much louder, much bolder. I also appreciate the earbuds having a push-click remote function. The T6 headphones have a ""fingerprint"" remote feature which made it very sensitive to touch. Just a slight ear scratch could pause music or activate Siri with the T6.I don't like how the remote-function doesn't allow you to skip ahead or reverse tracks. It only allows you to redial your last phone call. I next to never use my phone so it's too much of an awkward surprise to see who I may be calling instead of skipping to the next track. The battery life of the T10 also takes a little longer to charge  versus the T6.",3,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"I bought these to replace a more expensive pair of bluetooth headphones that recently died and was cautiously optimistic about these based on the reviews I read but somewhat skeptical because of the price (about $34 including tax with a coupon). I've just used these for the first time and will update my review if any major issues arise as I use these more.First off, these come in a nice charging case that stays closed thanks to a few magnets on the lid and the earbuds are held in place inside the case with another set of magnets. The earbuds turned on as soon as I took them out of the case and paired to my phone without any issues. I didn't have any issues with the bluetooth connection with my phone in my front pocket.  I was a little worried about the earbuds falling out while running but the rubber earpieces that were already installed on them fit perfectly and held them securely in place. They also come with two other sizes so I would assume that most people would be able to find a size that works for them. The battery lasted my entire run with no issues and when I put the earbuds back into the case the turned off and began to recharge. The case also has blue LED indicators to show how much battery power is left in the main battery, nice feature.",5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"I mainly use these earbuds for listening to music.  They are terrific.I tried them to make phone call, but the person on the end was complaining poor quality.",3,1,2019-9-1,1,1,0
"I've had these earbuds for more than 3 months now, and even this week when I used them I had to rave about them to my husband! For a very affordable price, these are really great earbuds, and I rave about them for several reasons: 1) They fit my ears! Other earbuds either fall out of my ears after 2 seconds or when I move my head, or feel very uncomfortable after a few minutes. Not so with these. They come with 4 sizes of flexible cups, and the S size work perfectly for me. I can wear them when I go walking for more than half an hour and when I get back I don't even feel the need to take them out, I just keep listening. 2) Great sound quality for great price. I'm not saying these are audiophile quality earbuds, but I listen to music or audio books or stream shows, and all sound great, with good balance and bass. 3) Fast and easy pairing. I never had any problems pairing a device, and they find the connection within seconds. 4) Good battery and clever charging case. Battery seems to last a good long time. I love that the storage case is the charging case.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"These things are cheap for real wireless earbuds, and I think that's a big part of their selling point. I use them when I walk or exercise as they don't fall out of your ear during movement. For this purpose they are fantastic, especially at this price point. I can't complain about the sound because they're much better than my previous set of wireless earbuds and only cost a bit more.Unfortunately, there are some issues with it beyond the sound quality. The battery life is a bit low. They promise around 4 hours, but really you'll probably get 2 or 3. That's not horrible as most people will probably use them for exercise anyway. A bigger problem for me is the lack of functionality within the headphones. My prior set had the ability to pause/play, skip, and increase the volume. The only thing these do is allow you pick up a phone call which kind of sucks. They could have included all of these features with the single button. I rarely get phone calls, and I don't ever accept them with headphones, so that's something I don't find useful at all.",4,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"I wanted these to wear in the pool while working out to a fitness album stored on my phone. I can leave my phone in my bag and do my workout without disturbing other swimmers. Because of the water resistance rating, I am not worried if water splashes on my ears. (To be clear: I do not swim in these. I am working out in chest-deep water). They pair immediately with my Android phone. I switched out the earbuds for one of the smaller sizes for a more comfortable fit. When I get home, I pop the entire case on my wireless charger. They also paired easily with my desktop computer. For the price, very pleased.",5,1,2020-9-4,1,1,0
"I am giving this product four stars, not five, because they are physically not the most comfortable pair I've tried. In my opinion, the ""stem"" is a bit too long, so it isn't snug and I have to ""screw"" it into my ear. After a few times, you get used to it, but it's still not the most comfortable fit. However, the quality of sound is excellent, even of the microphone (which is very hard to find within this price range). And the connection is good and stable. I've done phone calls and Zoom conferences with these headphones, and I have gone jogging with them. They work great everywhere. I've been caught in the rain with them and they still work as well as ever. But again, for me the quality of the microphone was one of the key factors because I do a lot of phone calls and virtual meetings. Everyone says they hear me very well.I am not a fan of controls on these: you can answer the phone call and you can pause a music track, but the volume has to be adjusted on the main device. However, it's still good for the price.",4,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"I don't write many reviews!  I do read a lot of them and I am very careful with my purchases.  I am a bit of a techy and I want to the best of the  best when spending my money. I currently have the Sennheiser Momentum earbuds and these are the best I have heard and I have sampled dozens before purchasing them.  I have been EXTREMELY happy with them even still months after the purchase.  The kind of happy when I am in the gym and song with a great bass line hits you and I start smiling because bass is shaking your entire ear drum.....yeah they are THAT good!  Well I listen to them soo much that I worried that i would wear them out too soon.  Yeah your thinking, so just go get another pair right?, not with that price tag!  So I started looking for a budget earbud that could give me a great sound without all the bells and whistles so I can alternate between the two. I read all the reviews here on Amazon and came across quite a few of them. Some sounded like crap, but stayed in my ears good, some sounded ok, but would slide out of my ears, and then...I found them....TOZO. Not only do they sound good, they are small, and they stay in my ears, and they are LOUD, and they have great BASS, and they have great TREBLE and they have great SEPARATION.  I was even able to make them sound even better by adding Comply foam tips 200 series to them to make them more isolated for bass, and they will stay in your ears better under hard sweaty workouts.  DISCLAIMER...these are a bare basic earbuds...these don't have passthrough , you can not even control volume from the earbud, but I don't need that as I can do that all from i-watch or i-phone. Give them a try!",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"An excellent combination of sound, wearability and affordability. Comes with different sized rubber ear buds so you can find the best fit. I don't have much experience with wireless earbuds so I have the battery a 4 out of 5 but, honestly: when they do run out it's after a solid 4 to 5 hours of very loud use (for me) and then after about 30 minutes in their charging case they register as 100 percent again.The case also holds a recharge for quite some time. I have left mine unplugged for a week with occasional use and have yet for the case to run down past 2 of the 4 dots showing it's charged.",5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0

"I've read enough reviews to be able to give you a solid review of the product and the expectations for this product.  While the unit is very well build and a solid overall product, the resounding issue seems to be the hit/miss of the Left ear bud.  I did discover that the ear pieces can fallout without the proper size in your ear (I will chalk that up to the user since the company provides alternate sizes so you can find the best one for you).  The product in my case lasted 3 plus hours (which is better than expected).  The drawback comes back to the Left ear bud not connecting well (and to recap what others were saying, the phone would be within a foot or so from the ear buds).  If you happen to get a good pair that doesn't buffer, then your in luck.  If yours buffer (likely the culprit is the left ear piece), then decide it the price is worth keeping it vs returning it.",2,1,2019-3-14,1,2,0
"I saw these on sale and said what the heck. Got a pair for me and a pair for my girlfriend who has been hounding me to get apple pods. When she saw these and got jealous I whipped out the pair I got her and she snatched em. We were both amazed by how nice the presentation of the packaging is, the materials, and most importantly the sound. Heaps of low end. She jumped up and down to see if they would pop out. They didnt. Even if they did they come with different size plugs. I love that you can charge them from the carry case suppposedly up to 4 times. I listened to these all night and they went strong the whole time. The case is magnetized so that it snaps shut and so are the buds themselves. They pop right in and charge. Pairing was a breeze. The case door is opaque so you can see the chargu g status. I notice on the white set, it wasnt as clear to see the status as on the black...at least in a lit room. I saved myself about 150 bucks since she is happy enough with these. She pretty much ignored me the whole night listening to her music with these on. As far as that goes, it blocks out a good amount of sound. I flushed the toilet with these on and I had to open lid to see if it really flushed because I heard zero noise so do t drive with these on listening to music.

"E: Tozo requested I amend this review. Their customer service has been good, so my rating goes from 3 to 4 stars for the time being.This was the 6th or 7th pair of wireless earbuds under $100 ive tried, and these (to me at least), had the best sound. I was SOO happy with them. After a week and a half though, I started getting the sound cutting out constantly in the left earbud. I returned that pair, thinking that Id just gotten unlucky. Replacement pair came...same thing. Not working RIGHT out of the box.  And on that pair, the sound didnt feel quite as crisp as the first pair. Im trying ONE more time. Honestly with the features and stuff, the sound quality...these would be my highest rated earbuds under $50. Unfortunately, that doesnt matter much if it wont produce sound. Im not sure if its just a cheap parts lottery where some have this issue. I did everything i could think of to troubleshoot this. Left it charging for a day. Deleted the bluetooth profile and reconnected. Moved away from sources of interference. Moved the phone closer to my head (which kinda defeats the purpose but still). Anyway....

"I have had these headphones for almost a year now and they are the longest pair of headphones I have had till this date. I purchased these headphones October 2019. What I dislike the most of these headphones are the battery life. They only last for about 3-4 hours long when I have seen their competitors have longer battery life. Otherwise, they would be perfect headphones, when I put these headphones on I cannot hear a single word from anyone clearly. I have worn these headphones in the shower regularly with no damage, but what really made me right this review is what happened today. I was amazed about what happened. When my mom discovered my headphones bouncing in my dryer due to the noise it was causing. Unbeknownst to me, I had left my headphones in my pockets! Therefore, my headphones had endured a 45 minute wash and 30 minutes of dry time. I was disappointed in the lack of my carelessness(normal I always check my work pants for items), I thought ""AFTER ALLLL THIS TIME, NOW I GOTTA BY A NEW PAIR..."". TURNS OUT, I DONT! I was able to turn them on like no damage had been done and the sound quality was stillllllll the same. FOR THE LACK OF BETTER WORDS, I WAS THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED!

This device is a nice quality product. It has very good sound quality. It works great for music and for phone calls. It does have a built in mic for the phone call and the caller states that it has a good quality sound on their end. The only complaint I have with this product is that even after trying all the different sized earbuds they tend to fall out. It may be just the shape of my ears although I have other earbuds that are not uncomfortable. I cant get them in far enough to get the full benefit of the bass sounds.  The battery life is not so great but the charging station is a battery so that you can recharge them without always plugging them in. I wish they would have fit my ears better. I would suggest anyone to buy these. If they fit... you will love them. PS: Sometimes you will have to press the LEFT ear bud to get it to sync with the right one. Takes a bit to understand how they work but it's worth the effort.,4,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"I use these for listening to podcasts on my phone, and I am not impressed. (1) The battery only lasts about 2-3 hours (and my phone is in my pocket or next to me, so they don't have to reach very far! (2) The speech clarity is not great. I'm not an audio expert, but my impression is that they've done something to emphasize bass for music which hurts speech quality -- almost echoey? (3) I now realize that I should have checked for this in advanced, but I was surprised and disappointed that the only control is the on/off button, so to do volume adjustment or replay I have to pull out and unlock my phone. I've never seen connected BT buds with this limitation. (4) the left and right buds are indistinguishable unless you have enough light to read dark grey against black L/R, or can remember that the right bud has the tiny light slightly left of center and the left bud has it slightly right of center. (5) I knew this from reviews before I bought, but now regret not being able to use either bud independently (you can use right alone, but not left).UPDATE: Raising from 2 to 3 stars, because it has the best (most consistent, quickest) bluetooth connectivity of any BT earbuds I've ever used. Also the charging station is very convenient (although its micro-USB charging jack is recessed in a too-small orifice so that cables with sturdy plugs can't fit in, which is unfortunate.)",3,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"This is an update to my prior review. I contacted the people in charge of these ear buds and got a hold of Sophie, she was great in making sure I was happy with their product, there customer service is fantastic and they will be sending out a new ear bud to replace the malfunctioning one. I am surprised and how fast they got back to me and the care they have for their customers and how much faith they have in their product. I look forward to doing a full (updated) review when I get the replacement earbud.I just received my ear buds yesterday and set them up only to have the left ear bud cut out and not work. The right side sounds great but the left side crackles and cuts in and out. I tried to repair them but the same thing happens. I was super excited to get these only to have this happen. I wish I could review the sound but being only have it the item works I can't give a full review, though the right side sounds really good. It seems like the noise cancelation would work well but I can't really review that either and I don't know about the battery life. I will probably send it back if I don't hear back from the seller...I'll give it another day or two to see if they get back to me, I'm not sure their email work though.

"Holy smokes! I just got home from work, saw these got delivered, and told one of my 7 kids to grab them for me while I headed directly outside to continue working on my new deck outside. I was linked and listening to music in less than 2 minutes! It took more time to get them out of the box than to link them to my phone and disappear into a musical masterpiece of noise cancellation! With 7 kids 11 and under (we have a healthy marriage) all wanting to talk to me when I get home every day, noise cancellation is probably most important for me. Not only do I now just see mouths moving with no noise. I have a superior sound quality that makes me feel like I am sitting in front of the speakers at a concert! The bass is so subtle, yet penetrating. These buds have made me much more thankful that I am alive during a period where noise cancellation of children is available without tiptoeing at jail time! Thank you Tozo for making my life more complete, and possibly saving some children from being given up for adoption! Disclaimer: I am posting this on my wife’s Amazon account, and for all the snowflakes....I would never harm my children in any way or give them up for adoption! They are a great tax right off, and make my stimulus check larger!-Dusty",5,1,2020-5-15,1,1,0
"**Update**I ended up not returning the headphones & over time, my experience of them got better. They dont cut in & out anymore (Yay!) & I finally get it: The Right headphone is the dominant or lead of the two. They fall out of my ear about 10 minutes into my run. When this happens, I dry them off & push them back in. This can loosen up in my love about 2x each in a 30 minute run.",4,1,2019-9-8,1,1,0
"I’ve had these earbuds for about three weeks now, and I must say, for what I paid for them, they are terrible! The “sound quality” that’s so highly bragged about, just isn’t there for me. I’ve tried every combination of earbud covers they come with, and they still sound like $5 dollar store earbuds, with  a very tinny, weak tone. I’ve changed my equalizer on my iPhone a dozen, or more times and still can’t fix it. Just a small nitpick on them, and I would have said this even if I had liked them, they look absolutely stupid in your ears! Not low profile, whatsoever. If you lie down with them in your ears, you will have trouble laying on your side, as they protrude around half an inch out of your ears. Now for the real reason for the negative review; THE BATTERY LIFE! The battery life on these earbuds is god-awful! They claim 4 hours on a full charge (if I remember correctly, I didn’t check the listing before writing this) and when you unbox them, the features list on the box claims “a 3 hour battery life”. (Again, I did not check before writing this, however actual product claims hour less than listing here) Instant lie right there, folks. I have seen a MAXIMUM 2 hour life with mine on a full charge and that’s on volume click 4... Not impressive at all. And the “fast charging” feature, is not that quick. 45 minutes to get a full charge. For example, my old $12 Walmart earphones had a max life of 6 hours on a 90 minute charge! What. The. Heck. Problem is, they are very fragile pieces of junk, that crap out from on drop of water. That’s why these aren’t only one star. The water-resistance is really good, so far, and the 4 charge case is really nice, as well.Bottom line; is if you asked me how much I’d say these are worth, let me use them for two days,then said name the price, I’d tell you $20. Fifty dollars for these is absolutely ridiculous. They are nice, in a couple of ways, but definitely not worth fifty bucks. There’s plenty of WAY better options on here, for that price.",2,1,2019-8-27,1,2,0
"For $40, I did not expect these earbuds to be top of the line. I did, however, expect them to work properly.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt for a few weeks; silly me because now the return window is closed. Here is a short list of problems:-Constant popping noises",4,1,2019-3-5,1,4,1
"Tl;dr: T10 buds work fine, however I find the T6 a better version than the T10.I purchased the Tozo T6 headphones a while back after seeing them on a lightning deal (I also purchased their wireless charger at the time). I give both 5 stars all the way around. Unfortunately I lost one of my T6 earbuds during a shopping trip. I still used the single for a while but I wanted to replace them.",3,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"Works well when everything is just right. Set-up before each use can be fiddly(or not). I have to open up Bluetooth connections & select R earpiece, before removing them from case. Sometimes the connection goes from on to pairing mode to nothing & have to replace buds in case & start again.  Turning on & off by holding down clicker on bud requires enough pressure that I can't hear the on/off cues(this partly because the bud must be rotated once in ear canal & click spot is not tactile). Not reliable to stay in place when moving around, so I only use inside which suits my needs. At least you don't have to worry when it fall in the sink. Like the sound quality.  I use them to listen to podcasts as I fall asleep & the buds allow comfort in sidelying. However, the alert notification is loud enough to wake me @ 4 hours-which kind of defeats my purpose in using them.  Would be happy to just have a ding warning or let the charge expire.",4,1,2019-12-8,1,1,0
"I've had these a few months now and wanted to share my experience. It's easy to review right away (something they kept pestering me to do with initial impressions that don't line up with longer term usage. I've generally been happy with them, but there are a few things that have annoyed me about them.I bought these to replace the cheap wired earbuds I've used for years to mainly use to listen to audiobooks while riding my bike, doing chores and running errands. I haven't really listened to a lot of music with them so I can't speak too well to how they sound as the requirements for audiobooks are pretty different. But they've been pretty good for my audiobooks.",4,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"They are great for what I bought them for, listening to audiobook in the shower.  I use this before, during, and after my shower.  They work great for that.  Now the negative.  When you take them out of your ear, that does not disconnect them from playing audio.  Some times I pick up the earbuds, and they are still playing. Why don't they turn off when taken out of your ear.  You have to turn them on and off manually.  I'm not sure why they don't disconnect/turnoff when you put them in the charger, but they don't.  I believe the T12's did, but they were waterproof but would flake when water touched the control panels on the earbuds.  The T10's also have some weird connecting thing... one connects to the phone and the other one syncs with the connected earbud.  It seems to work better connect the left earbud than the right (that might be reversed). All these combine to lower my star rating and keeps me using my Apple AirPods most of the time.",3,1,2020-9-29,1,0,0
I did really like these bc I did not want to spend 150.00 on apple pods. I did have to give them to my fiancé though bc unfortunately they do fall out of my ears. I do have pretty small ears (I guess) I usually always have this problem even after I adjusted them with the smallest rubber fitting they send with the ear phones they still do fall out. I have tried to adjust them while wearing and I only get maybe a good 10-15 minutes of walking before they start to fall out again. Another thing I wish is that you can talk on the phone with them. I thought you could so when I tried answering a call they didn’t work so that was a bummer (not a necessity) but that woulda been cool. I bought my fiancé wireless ear phones last year so we swapped. Like I said I did like them I just wish they were a bit smaller to fit in my ears. I even read some reviewed and a review where a guy had smaller ears and he said with the rubber adjustment fitting they worked for him so I figured I would give it a shot.,3,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"Sound quality is not bad. Good for listening and great that they are so tiny and simple. I really like this about them. The charging case is convenient and I like that they turn on automatically when removed from the charging case. Also good is by pressing the earbud itself you can pause your audio file.When you pause and then un-pause, it takes a half-second for the sound to reach full volume again. So if you're studying a lecture or podcast this way you'll miss little bits of it if you are pausing and un-pausing often.",3,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0

"I was Initially very disappointed with the battery life on these.  The description claims much more than what mine actually get.  I fully charged them and then at about 2 hours I get the a low battery indicator.  I reproduced this phenomena every single time that I fully charged them.  It’s a shame because everything else about the earbuds is solid.  Maybe I got a lemon, but for this price range I would steer you towards a different product.Update: the manufacturer has reached out to me and believes that the unit I received is defective.  They are shipping me a new one.  I will further update the review once I have tested the new set.  I would say that their customer is very timely and professional.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
So far so good! The sound quality is pretty dang good! It came packaged well and they feel pretty nice. I bought a different wireless earbud and ended up returning them because they stopped working after two weeks of little use. I came back to this one and I like how sturdy the earbuds sit in the case. They definitely won’t budge like the other earbuds I had purchased. I’m loving them so far!Update:,4,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"Listen we bought 2 of these for our girls for Christmas. I normal hate earbuds, they hurt my ears. These are great they have several sizes for the earbuds, I wear them jogging!!! They are amazing, absolutely no discomfort. They are also waterproof and I know it from first hand experience....Well, I ran a pair with in the charging container through the washing machine, and I dried them (it was on a low setting thankfully), and the damn things came out and still worked!!!! 7 months  later both pairs are still working great. I just bought my very own set because I am in love, and my daughter is done sharing with me. I wear them to do the lawn, jogging, and in the house. We now have 3 working pairs, we are super hard on just about everything. These keep up, and they don’t look worn, or dirty. I keep mine in my purse so that no one snatches mine. I can’t say enough good things about them and the price is perfect for our budget too. In my honest opinion if you make this purchase you won’t be disappointed.",5,1,2020-6-18,1,0,1
"This was my first pair of true wireless earbuds, as I had assumed that good sound quality for would probably only come at a premium price when compared to wired IEMs.  I was pleasantly surprised by the overall sound quality, and the ease of pairing and the intuitive controls were a big plus.  There is PLENTY of bass when you get the right tips fitted... at first I was concerned that the bass would overwhelm the other frequencies, but after adjusting the equalizer settings on my iPhone, they felt more balanced.  Battery life is OK, though not quit what the product description would suggest, and the nice charging case mitigates that problem to some degree.  At about the 4 month mark, the left earbud would no longer hold a charge, but when I contacted the vendor, they immediately offered to replace it...GREAT SERVICE!!Overall, I'm very satisfied with the earbuds and the customer service, and highly recommend this item and the Tozo brand in general!",5,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
I thought I would try out some wireless earbuds at work to minimize distracting co-workers. I work in a very noisy office.  I didn't want to spend an upwards of $100 or more just to find out that earbuds weren't the answer to drown out my co-workers. I was pleasantly surprised when these arrived. I love that the case is also a wireless charger. I did put the smaller ear tips on these and I can wear them comfortably for 8 hours a day listening to podcasts or music with ZERO outside distractions. I'm glad that I didn't buy a more expensive item that virtually does the same thing as these. The audio quality is great and they aren't noise canceling and the earbuds themselves do not have volume control but that's ok. They were easy to pair to my phone and also computer (with a USB bluetooth adapter).  *TIP* let the right earbud pair with your device before removing the left from the case. The right earbud is the primary and the left is the slave and will connect to the right. Once I figured that out it was smooth sailing.,5,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0
"I've had these for about a month now -- so while I can't speak to longevity, I'm loving them so far. Compared to other wireless buds/phones I've owned they: 1.) pair much more easily and reliably -- just remove them from the case and they power up and find my iPhone; and 2.) have amazing sound quality.I have small ears, so I had to use the smallest insert. I won't say they fit like a glove -- I think only a custom mold like pro musicians get would do that -- but they are reasonably comfortable and have only slipped out once, during a very vigorous workout. I've used them during normal workouts and bike rides with no slip-out issues.",4,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"The sound cancellation is actually a benefit I didn't count on and is pretty good!  What's superior here is sound and ease of use.  I actually want to keep taking these out to use for everyday use when I bought them JUST for workout.I've also bought a previous pair that died with sweat and was completely cumbersome.  The reason was the button for interaction was touch and if my hair, sweat touched it... songs paused, changed, etc.  These buds actually have a physical touch you have to do and i LIKE that.",2,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
The sound quality is perfectly fine unfortunately for me these just hurt really bad.. i have tiny ears and can only use certain types - I thought these would be ok but I can even last 10 minutes without needing to adjust them and keep turning them different ways to make the pain go into a different part.. all for when I finally take them out to just have my ears throbbing.For anybody other than me these would probably be great but I can’t use them ☹️,4,1,2019-12-10,1,1,0
"I picked these up as a way to avoid bugging my housemates when listening to music and podcasts in the shower, and they work really well for that purpose! These are supposed to be waterproof, and thus far, this is proving to be true, although I should mention that I don't keep my head under the water the entire time I'm in. The charger/case is small and fits easily in my purse, and I like that it came with a little cord should I choose to wear the case instead. They also block sound fairly well and the sound quality itself is comparable with other headphones I use and enjoy. The case also seems to charge quite efficiently, and as long as I turn the buds off before replacing them, I don't have to charge the case very often - I only charge it maybe once every 1.5-2 weeks or so, and that's with daily use.My only real complaints with the headphones are that 1) I can't seem to select buds that *perfectly* fit and stay in my ears, 2) it took me a couple days to realize that I should be actively shutting the buds off before putting them back in their case/charger,  3) they seem to want to shift a bit if I'm moving my jaw too much, and 4) the Bluetooth connection can be a touch finicky. The first issue is relatively minor, the second is on me because I should have read the manual more carefully (though it was a pain to put them in there and realize a couple days later that they were dead and so was the case), the third is on me because my jaw pops and moves more than it probably should. The connection issue is a bit of a pain, but is manageable; it took me some time to recognize how to best help the connection along by ensuring that my phone is thoughtfully placed in my pocket, or to make sure I'm not blocking the right-side bud too much. If you hold that bud in your hand (like clench it in your fist), the connection will cut out. If I lay down and have the right side of my head resting on my arm, the connection will cut out. However, I can also wander all around my decently-sized apartment without too much issue in terms of connection, regardless of whether my phone is on me, so this isn't a particularly major problem.",4,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"First of all, I feel like it's insane you can get $50 Bluetooth headphones like these. So the value is amazing. They don't always automatically pair (I have to select them on my phone) and Bluetooth audio sometimes skips a handful of times an hour but that's fine, I chalk that up to Bluetooth in general. (And if I put my phone in my front jacket pocket instead of my side pocket, it never skips -- that's radio waves for ya.)BUT the fact that I can only pause/play music by tapping the button, and can't change volume or skip... UGH. It's really annoying. I'm the type of person who keeps a big playlist of everything, and when a song comes on skips it half the time because it's not my mood... and this is while biking/running... so to really enjoy these I'm forced to create more separate ""mood"" playlists, which I guess is fine, but I'd rather not.",4,1,2019-6-5,1,0,0
T10--Great sound,4,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0
"I bought the Tozo T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds with Wireless Charging Case to replace my Samsung Galaxy Buds, because I gave those to my teenage son.  To be honest, my expectations weren't too high because of the extremely reasonable low price point of these wireless earbuds.  Now that I have been using them for a few weeks I must say that I am very pleasantly surprised by these earbuds!  I love that I can charge them either via the micro USB port on the charging case, or via a Qi charger.  I have charged them both ways, and they charge great.  They also have four blue LEDs that communicate clearly how charged the case is (1 LED = not very charged; 4 LEDs = fully charged).  The earbuds themselves fit me just fine with the standard size ear gel that comes fitted to the earbuds.  But in case you have different-sized ears, they come with three other sizes of ear gels.  It also comes with a charging cable, to charge via micro USB.  I like that htey are water resistant, though I haven't challenged that feature yet.  I'm just glad to know that I don't need to worry about them getting a little bit wet.  The sound quality if very good, and they seem to cancel noise quite well.  All things considered I am extremely pleased with the value of these earbuds, and would recommend them to potential buyers.",5,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
"I was so tired of navigating around the cord for my earbuds. I was tired of forgetting the “dongle” to connect them to my phone, when I went to the gym. After too many nights not getting to use my earbuds at the gym, I searched for Bluetooth ones while on the treadmill. These appeared, and are highly rated. I can see why! They are pretty great! I’m no audio file. I enjoy music, I like it loud and upbeat while I workout, and I DON’T want to fuss with, or work around a cord. I'm so glad I took a chance on these! I did have to put the smaller rubber things on for them to fit comfortably in my ears. If my workout is really vigorous I do have to adjust them periodically, but it’s all fine by me to have charged earbuds, with NO CHORD, and great sound, when I’m working out. If you’re looking for earbuds that hold a great charge. Have a recharging case (like that fruit company) and do what they’re intended to do... give these a try! I’ve even used them a couple times to answer a quick call (shhh... don’t tell my gym!) and they sound and work fine. The ac and massive fans were blowing while I was underneath and my son could hear me fine. These are FAR less $$$ than that fruit company and worth a try. I’m glad I bought them!",4,1,2019-11-21,1,0,0
"Overall, these are great headphones, you get about an four hours play time, sound is great, they fit well, and they stay in even during workouts. My only complaint is connection is weird a lot. Like at the gym, my phone will be on the floor next to me while bench pressing and the volume sometimes goes up and down or out completely, I have to constantly move my phone around even though it is in arms reach to get them to work. I have used them at my desk in my office with no problem. They also are very easy to pair which is a nice feature.",4,1,2020-9-30,1,1,0

"The headphones have pretty good sound quality and have a good fit but there's a lot of little things that add up to make it a not great product. The case is pretty bulky making it not fit in a pants pocket very well, the earbuds often connect to my phone while they are in the case supposed to be off and charging because they are not firmly secured on the charging port which is annoying, the earbuds themselves look bulky and earplug-like compared to other brands when worn, there is no way to skip to the next song using the button (two clicks redials the previous phone call which is dumb), and the case battery drains in a couple days even if I don't use the headphones. Lastly but most importantly, the left earbud keeps cutting in an out every 10 seconds or so. All of this adds up to make the headphones sub par.",2,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
"I wanted to float on my raft in the pool to exercise my lower body. I put my phone that plays books on tape in a water proof bag and keep it no more then 2 feet from my head. The ear phones cut in and out, which is annoying. So I charged them for four days and tried them again today and they still cut in and out. SO NOT WORTH THE MONEY because it does not play well. I don't know if they will work if they get a little wet, because I kept my ears out of the water. I just wanted to enjoy my books while floating and it is just annoying to listen to skip like I was listening to my old 33's on the home stereo.",2,1,2019-6-11,1,2,0
"I bought the Earfun Free wireless buds originally. They have great balanced sound with no harshness. However they are very uncomfortable for me or my daughter to use. They just hurt the ear canal with little use. So I took a shot at these to replace them to use to listen to podcasts while at work. I work in a noisy lab, and these block out a lot of the sound. A charge lasts a long time just listening to podcasts, I can't say for music with bass. I haven't run out of juice listening to a 4 hour podcast. The real downside is the sound. They have a harsh metallic resonance that hurts in the 8khz and 16khz range. Also it has a boost in the 250hz range that makes voices sound overly thick and boomy. It's not a deal breaker, you can download an EQ app and turn those frequencies down and get a better sound signature. Particularly the 8khz range is the problem, I had to turn it all the way down to get rid of the worst of the harshness. It's not a deal breaker for the price and comfort. I recommend foam tips, I didn't like the included tips.",4,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"The battery life is horrible. I'm getting an average of 4.5 hrs of ear bud usages. I'm a person who only uses 1 ear bud at a time. Making this not a big deal, since I can just swap it with the other one. After 2-3 swaps the case would go from full charge to 25%. I'm assuming 25%, b/c it has 4 lights that indicates it's battery life and it'll drop to the last light. So, it could be less the 25% for all I know. Again, this is just charging one ear bud at a time, so if I was to have use 2 ear buds then charge them both at the same time, I would only get barely 2 charges from them before needing to charge the case. That or I got a defective one and the case battery is bad?",3,1,2020-8-19,1,1,0
"To start with the good - These ear buds came packaged very nicely. They seemed to pair up quickly. I've had them back in the case several times today and every time I take them out of the case, they pair up with each other and my phone almost immediately. The fit and finish of the case seems very nice. I like the magnetic dock for the buds and the lid of the case. The sound is reasonably good. More than adequate for listening to podcasts.So what's my problem with these things? They just won't stay in my ear and it doesn't seem to help to change to a different size of rubber / silicone tip. No matter what size tip I use, they just aren't angled to properly go into my ear canal and as a result, the main body of the unit does not get into the main part of my ear (auricle) where they are supposed to rest. They just hang precariously there until they eventually fall out. I'm a guy, 5'10"" 180 lbs, with what I thought were regular sized ears.",2,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"I was searching for water resistant blue tooth headphones that I can use when sitting in a hot tub or the side of the pool, without being worried if it fell but I got more than what I wanted. They DO NOT recommend underwater use but if you are doing laps without diving underwater, it can be used for that. I did not expect that as of course this is still an electronic device and any such device is still not recommended to be put under water.  But if you want to jog or run while its raining, have at it. Build quality is  good, they are lightweight, sound is great especially if you have both headphones on.Not a fan of how it talks to you when you hang up or dialing for a call. But its bluetooth 5.0 so its a more stable connection and it connects fast. I even notice its finished connecting even before I put them in my ear.",4,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"T10 earbuds are the fourth pair of earbuds from TOZO I have used.  The T10 model appears to be an older/earlier model.  I have purchased and used the T6, T12, NC9, and now T10.  In comparison, the T10 model is the largest and heaviest of the charging cases.  Easy to remove earbuds from charging case.  T10 is the largest pair of ear buds.  The charging case is powered by the micro-USB which is nice if that is what most of your other electronics use.  The newer models of T12 and NC9 use the Type-C charging adapter.  The earbuds for T10 are of good quality material, connectivity via blue tooth is quick, range of blue tooth is adequate to leave the room, battery life is approximately 2 hours for each earbud on full charge.For the price of $30, these are a good solution and alternative to other higher price name brands.  TOZO also backs up their products with a good warranty if these are damaged or no longer function properly.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
"OK, just got these last night and I have to say I am impressed. Very easy to pair, I like the available ear cup sizes included (I wear an XL and it came with them) and the sound is quite good. Now the things I don't like. No volume control and no way to skip to the next track, you have to do this all from your phone. Not a huge deal as you do have a pause feature but it would be nice not to have to pull out the phone whenever I want to increase/decrease the volume or change the track. These are not Active Noise Cancelling earbuds but they do have Noise Isolation due to the ear cups. I really like ANC but for $40 I was not expecting that, and the isolation is pretty good. As for battery life, Amazon states 4 hours playtime but in the manual it states 3 hours. In reality I get right about 4 hours as stated. Recharging from the case takes about an hour for a full charge. Not to bad. The simple fact is that they fit my ears and sound very good which outweighs most of the negatives.",4,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0

"UPDATE: July 2020: over time of prolonged use, I made direct connection of migraine type headaches... The horrible pain radiated down through my neck jaws, one or both sides, without fail. I began wearing only one at a time since I used more for phone calls than music etc. I cont developing this headaches radiating through my jaw. Reminded me o vicious TMJ flare-up. If sensitive to radiation such as myself, there's a great app that reads and monitors 24/7 with notifications of origin etc. I wanted to share this asap just as a consideration when purchasing TOZO earbuds....Great choice for the outdoors... I frequently choose not to stay connected to my phone while I'm working outside. If I chose to do so, I lost my earpiece(s) or they fizzled out due to watering or being sweaty in the summer heat. I now remain in touch with my calls and not fumbling with gloves or mud and dirt on my hands. The sound is great and charging is brilliant.

Had trouble with one ear bud and Tozo replace the whole set in 2 days with very pleasant customer service.",3,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"I was excited to get these but once I used them for the first time, I knew they were going back. They sound very good and I had no problems connecting through Bluetooth. The major problem is they are limited in function. There is NO function to skip to the next song or previous song. There is no function to increase or decrease volume. It came with two sets of instructions: a booklet that essentially confirmed the functionality flaws I mentioned and a ""starting guide"" that had different capabilities listed that did NOT work.One other bug that others mentioned: The left earbud would drop out occasionally.",1,1,2020-6-18,1,1,1
"I just received these yesterday.  The case is light and compact.  Pairing the ear buds to my iPhone happened almost instantly.  They feel comfortable and secure, so far. It's very easy to pause what I'm listening to, as well.  I did notice that the sound would cut in and out, if I walk from my living room to the front guest room (my house isn't huge), so that was a little disappointing.  I use Sony blue tooth ear buds that has much better bass.  So, the jury is still out. I use mine, primarily, to listen to audio books so I can walk around and do my household chores, or listen to a book while walking my dog. I think they'll do fine.  I have a feeling, though, that I'll have to keep my phone in my pocket so the range won't cut out on me. I will update in a few days, after I've used them more. That's when I'll know how the battery life is.UPDATE: I've had more time to use these ear buds and I've grown to like them a lot. They do fit, snugly, so I don't worry about losing them.  These are super easy to pair. When I lift them out of the charging case, all can hear that the buds are pairing. I go to the Bluetooth in my iPhone and choose the Tozo name and it's paired!  I do have to keep the phone in my pocket, though, if I'm walking around the house-- or I lose the signal.  For the price, I'm happy!",5,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0
"This is a decent set of earbuds for the price.  Good value compared to the $200 sets.  I like the sound quality,  the price, and the fit.  Now on to the dealbreaker. I usually only wear the right earbud while I'm working because I need to hear what's going on around me.  With my last pair of bluetooth earbuds, they were connected together with a wire. I ran it through the top button on my shirt and the left earbud went into my left shirt pocket. With this truly wireless pair,  I can't leave the left one just rolling around in a pocket unconnected to anything.  It will eventually fall out somewhere and disappear.  What I've tried to do is just pick up and use the right one and leave the left one in the case.  The right one beeps at me every 2 -3 seconds until I connect the left one.  If I put it back in the case,  the beeping starts... if I walk out of range of the left,  the beeping starts.  Nothing I do short of connecting the left and leaving it rolling around in a pocket on my person stops this beeping. It makes this pair unusable for me and it's very frustrating.  This can't be such a rare scenario that no one would think of a way around it.  One idea would be to have a way to shut off the beeping with a button push or by leaving the left one off altogether.  This pair will probably get passed on to someone else who doesn't mind having both in all the time.  Other than the flaw with this particular scenario,  they are a good pair.",3,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0

I am pretty pleased with these $20 earbuds. I have had them since February and I have used them a lot for everyday activities to picking up calls while I am driving and exercising. I would buy these again. Here are some pros and cons for you to consider before purchasing.Pros:,4,1,2020-9-28,1,0,0

"These earbuds is what I've been looking for. I have an iPhone and checked theirs and they were way out of my price range. The quality and comfort of these is amazing. I love that as soon as I pick up the right earbud it automatically pairs with the left and with my phone. I used it the other night on a long distance call and was on for about an hour, I was on the next night for about a half hour and listened to my book for about another hour and still have plenty of charges left.This comes in several colors and wish I had gotten the white to match my hair... lol. This comes with 4 ear ""caps"" to fit comfortably in your ears. It doesn't have a volume control but to me that's not a problem. When you tap the right side it disconnects your phone call, or stops your book if you listen to books online. If you hold it down for about 5 seconds it turns the power off but  I've found there is no need for that because when you place them in the case it starts to charge. Also each side is magnetic. Terrific  product at a great price.In fact I've told several friends and they are contemplating buying a pair. Thank you",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,1
"The first night I used these they would fall out frequently even when I was just sitting down or washing dishes. I tried different sizes and it didn't help. When I tried to get the warranty it had me fill out a review so it seemed like I couldn't get the warranty without the review. Then, they ask for the headline of my review and stated that I would receive a free gift but not to mention it to anyone (A.K.A. on my review). It is sketchy and I don't think the overall rating is accurate. I returned these so now I am writing an honest review.On the other hand, the white looked very nice and I liked that you could see how full the battery pack was with the four white lights.",1,1,2020-2-10,1,1,0
"I've probably have gone through near 10 style earbuds in the last 15 years ranging from wired, bluetooth to truly wireless bluetooth, but these are by far the best in every column. Whether it be the price, battery life, noise cancelling, sound quality, pairing, staying connected and I can keep going on!They were simple to pair, charge and stay connected. I've had very few drops in connection, it might be interference from someone else being in proximity with their own bluetooth device(s). I'm enjoying the fact that while at the gym, I can block out all the noise around me without blowing out my ears at 100% max, be able to walk freely around the weight room without hardly any interference whether by equipment or other gym goers technology. I'm not audiophile, but it sounds really good, bass doesn't sound blown out. Battery life is spectacular, an hour of continuous use only consumes 20% of battery life and doesn't take long to fully charge as well, I don't think I've seen it drop below 80% after a gym session. Being waterproof, I don't have to fear washing my face after the sauna with them on.",5,1,2019-7-30,1,0,0
"I thought these we're in amazing purchase for the price that they are! They have a long battery life! I can wear them in the shower without having to worry about them breaking! When the battery finally does go low it does not take too long to get a full charge again! I would recommend buying these if you're like me and have never bought wireless headphones before, I saw all the good reviews and I'm grateful that I looked at all the reviews before purchasing because that always helps me to purchase something is the reviews! Like I said I definitely recommend purchasing these I got them in Black. I believe they have five colors to choose from in all. And they do not feel heavy in my ears and they fit well! I think the only thing I do not like is that it's kind of hard to press the button to answer phone calls at Etc.. But other than that I find these to be very good and I've had no problems with them! My husband actually wants a pair now he he!",5,1,2019-10-8,1,1,0
"I bought these along with the black pair of similarly priced boltunes ear buds with the plan to return the one I liked the least.  long story short, I am keeping both as they are both a five star product. the sound quality I give the slight edge to the tozos, although both can be extremely loud and the bass is decent in both, sound cancelation seemed equal, battery is the same for both, awesome! I usually have one pod in at moderate volume which lasts nearly six hours, the claim to hold a charge for 3 hours per use with both buds in at moderate volume. the case has four charges, so essentially 12 hours of solid use!!! that is great. range I give the edge to the boltunes as they can tolerate being a bit further away from your source (phone). the boltunes also have the edge in aesthetics as well being the typical style of ear bud while the tozos are a bit ""Frankenstein-ish"" lol. I have the boltunes in my ear now and my wife has the franken tozos, cant go wrong with either!!!!",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"I purchased these for my work-from-home audio meetings. It took a bit of research to figure out how to get the left side to work, but now it's a simple thing to pop them in and hear in both ears. The sound quality is good, while I am by my phone, but if I walk about 10 feet away, they start crackling. I don't remember how long the range is supposed to be, so this may be a practical distance for any wireless earbuds. I'm not sure.",4,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"The headphones are great when they are working properly: good, clear sound quality, good noise cancellation.Connectivity was very inconsistent. Sometimes I would have the headphones working clearly when my phone was at the other end of the house (I didn't even notice because there were so few cut-outs). At other times, the headphones would cut out constantly when my phone was in my pocket while I was going for a walk. So, very inconsistent, but I bought them for working out, so I would usually keep my phone nearby when I was doing exercises and this worked for my purposes.",2,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
I've been using these for almost a week and they're my first pair of wireless earbuds. I use them mainly for working out or running and didn't have any issues with them falling out. Once I put them on and changed out the ear piece to the smallest size they fit perfectly and comfortably. Out of the box they had a little bit of a charge but fully charging them in the case didn't take very long and I like how you can see how much power they have while charging or when taking them out of the case.The sound quality is awesome with a good amount of bass and I can't hear anything when I have them on. Pairing them to my phone with Bluetooth was easy and took less than a minute. They feel well made and of high quality and they're at a good price point. I don't have anything to compare them to other than a similar pair my brother owns that he got for $80.,5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"I bought these for lap swimming.  They lived for about 5 laps - then the left one died, likely due to water damage as they were fully changed.  When they worked they cut out every time my head was underwater - thus I only heard sound when I was breathing to the right.The sound quality was great - nice deep bass.  They connected really easily and quickly.  They would be great for sports, just not for real swimming.  I am returning.",2,1,2019-9-15,1,1,0
"These are great headphones.  What I've noticed is that while in their charge case, not being used, if the battery level of the case falls below a level that will charge the buds, they will connect to your paired BT device without being removed from the case.  You wouldn't notice this unless your were looking at your phone to see the headphone symbol appear in the status bar.  You might notice if you were listening to an audio source but if you didn't, the headphone batteries would drain to zero.  So you must be mindful of the case charge level as well as the bud charge to get the most out of these.  I will say that TOZO the company has been great when I've not been completely satisfied with one of their products and replaced it or refunded my purchase price at my option.  I love the wireless charge case, I don't like how these buds will connect without being removed from the case.",4,1,2019-6-26,1,1,0

"I haven't been using these long yet so I'll have to update this review later.So far these earbuds are excellent, they were super easy to pair with my phone. Unlike the previous ones I tried (different brand) the volume has a much wider range. I can listen at a much lower volume instead of being near the too loud setting. The music I'm listening to sounds great as well. The earbuds also fit really well in my ear and are comfortable. Unlike other earbuds there are more sizes included if the ones already on the earbuds don't fit well in your ears.",5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
I bought these to replace a set that was over $150 that broke. My main use is to listen to music while weightlifting. These don't sound as good as the ones that broke but they are nothing to complain about... Especially at the price. They are extremely comfortable and light. You can hardly feel them and once in place they cancel the surrounding nose fairly well. I also really like the case and being able to simply place it on a charging pad. That's a great feature. During my usage of 3-4 times a week for about 2 hours at a time I can usually get a week out of them before needing a charge.I have also used them to talk on the phone a few times and simply placed one in my ear. I could hear them and they me. Worked fine even in my old soft top Jeep. So again at this price I would but then again and will probably be buying the wife a set at some point. Her high dollar ones are still working....for now.,5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"My son and I both recently received a pair each of the Waterproof T10 Wireless earbuds and LOVE them!I purchased the first pair for him to have more flexibility while Coronavirus Homeschooling, so he was not literally tied to the computer during virtual classroom time if he had to get up and get something, etc. He was absolutely thrilled with them! So much so, that he wears them around the house and on car rides to listen to music or YouTube videos.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"First off, these are really well built for the price. They feel sturdy, not cheap. Even the case feels good.Second, they fit comfortably in my ear. I've been wearing bulky wireless headphones because I've never been able to find earbuds that would actually stay in my ear. I'm fairly active and previous earbuds would just keep falling out. But my headphones get crazy hot when I'm active. I was skeptical at first, but these earbuds are great! Follow the instructions (a simple twist in the ear) that come with them otherwise they won't fit right. I've been out but riding my bike, mowing my yard, and chasing my dog and these have remained firmly in my ears. I'm extremely impressed.",5,1,2019-5-20,1,0,1

"These are really nice Earbuds.  Everything they say is true.  A free 1 year warranty.  The product build is exceptional, as is the packaging in which they are shipped.  And they connected to my I-phone so quickly it was actually a non event. So, it was a very difficult decision when I decided to return them.I originally purchased and compared two sets of earbuds and this set of earbuds was superior to the other in all categories except one.  The sound.  And it was extremely close even in that category but, in the final analysis, I realized the quality of sound was the most important feature so I eliminated all others from my decision and the OFUSHO earbuds were the winner by a very small margin.  They are also a little less expensive but, again, I did not include that in my final decision.  If, like me, the sound quality of your earbuds is paramount, assuming all other features are acceptable, then choose the OFUSHO.  But, I really believe most people would prefer the exceptional features and quality build of these ear buds.  The quality of sound difference is truly marginal but enough for me to make my decision and the longer battery life is just a perk.",4,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0

"I've now had these for a few months, and overall I'm happy with the purchase...They can occasionally be a little fiddly when it comes to pairing - you absolutely have to remove the left earbud from the case before the right, if you don't the two buds won't connect to each other.  This can be sorted by dropped both back into the case and trying again. Along the same lines, I've found that they prefer to connect to my iPhone 6 more than my iPhone Pro (one is a work phone and the other is personal).  It doesn't matter which device they connected to last - if they can see the iPhone 6 that's what they connect to first.  Shutting the bluetooth off on the iPhone 6 solves the problem but it can be annoying.",4,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"These sound okay - they're definitely loud enough. I don't want to split hairs, 'cause these are fairly cheap at ~$50 - but... for me they're overly bass-heavy. Background though: I'm used to some (wired) earbuds that are audiophile quality reference headphones (MEE Audio Pinnacle P1's) - so if you're a bass-head & usually go for Beats by Dre or something like that - you'll probably have no issue with these earbuds.Love the case & that it's wireless charging.

"Pros: I love that it’s small and portable. It fits right in your pocket. I love that the carrying case acts as a charging station. I love that the case is sturdy and appears to be well-made. It closes nice and tight so I doubt you’ll have to worry about it opening spontaneously. The sound quality is good enough for me. You can use one earbud at a time or both. It pairs very easily to my iPhone. They also offer different sized ear pieces to fit any ear size. And I just realized you can charge it on a charging plate. I own one but have yet to try it. But I like to have that option. I can just drop it on the plate and pick it up when I need it. No need to fumble with the short charging wire.Cons: I wish the battery was longer. It advertises 4 hours but I don’t think it lasts that long. Maybe half that with continuous play/use. Thats why I just use one earbud at a time and alternate them. While one charges, one is in use. The sound also cuts out if you’re too far from the source or if the battery starts to run out. It also advertises that it’s noise-cancelling. This isn’t true. Maybe if you blast the volume to the point of deafness, you can drown out the noise around you, but I’d like to keep my sense of hearing.",3,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0

"Larger than some others but they fit OK in my ears. Sound is pretty good - a lot of high end and some bass (could do with more). The biggest issue for me is that when they get wet they turn off - they respond to each splash of water as if you touch it with your finger - so one splash and it turns off, two quick splashes and it skips to another song on your play list (forward or backward depending which ear bud is splashed) and so on. So even though they are rated as IPX8 for being waterproof, they are not useful if you want to swim with them or us them in the shower",3,1,2020-7-6,1,1,0
"This is my first pair of ear buds. After looking around a LOT and comparing prices and looking at reviews, I decided on this set. I like music with some bass. These have delivered that. Much more than I would have thought considering the size. These things rock! The stereo sound is perfect. I didn't give 5 stars for noise cancellation because, quite frankly, I'll need to test this feature a bit more. So far it is really good. Fitting these in the ears was kind of tricky until I watched the video that TOZO has for proper fit. After that and getting the right fit from the ear caps, these things rock! I may have said that once...That being said, they seem to lose power when not used within a day or so. This is not right.I'm amazed at the sound quality of these tiny things. They do not have the touch feature of other ear buds, but to be honest, I'd just as soon not have that feature. It's no problem to me to press the button on these. It's not uncomfortable to do so.",3,1,2019-12-6,1,0,1
I bought these earbuds about a year ago. I have an iPhone 11. No problems with syncing to Bluetooth. Sound quality is very good but I would not say excellent. Noise cancellation probably depends more on which plug used. It comes with a variety of different earplugs to fit the size of your ears. None of the earplugs fit perfectly and if I’m working out sometimes the whole earbud falls out of my ear which can be irritating. But the reason I give us a five star rating is because the battery life is excellent sometimes I put these in in the middle of the night and they ran all the way through my sleep cycle eight hours or more and still have plenty of years left in them for a work out in the morning. They charge inside the case so you don’t have to constantly keep plugging them in. For the price I would say these are a perfect purchase for the average user and much better than the air buds provided through Apple.,5,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0

"**Update**I really like the product and the concept. I got real bad news.. it stopped working for me :(. Amazon and Tozo have great customer service which is why I cannot give it one star because they are really trying to take care of me. However, I returned my first earbuds when the left earbud stopped responding. I sweat alot, and while I was working out lots of sweat came into my ears and the the left bud stopped responding. I contacted support and researched how I can fix this. They were helpful in trying to reset it, but no response from the earbud. I tried to recharge it in the case, and still no response. Tozo and Amazon then sent me a replacement and I sent back the non-responding pair of earbuds. Fast forward 2.5 weeks later and my left earbud of the replacement died again. Same situation, same attempt to resurrect. I really want to love this product with its nifty wireless recharging feature, decent sound, and comfort for my ears, but the earbud is not working. I am torn if I should get a 3rd replacement or just give up with my head down.

"I have been using various ""wireless"" earbuds for the past 2-years, primarily for use in the gym and subways. Since my gym sessions last between 2-3 hours each day, I can get pretty sweaty and need wireless buds that will not get affected by the moisture; they also need to be comfortable and stay in place while running and doing various exercises. I have been using the TOZO T10s for a couple of weeks now and they have been absolutely amazing! I use the largest of the three bud sizes and they fit perfectly and never feel as though they will fall out - even when running for an hour. The sound quality is great for wireless earbuds; they have great base and range, and sound good playing whichever genre of music I select (rap, hip-hop, rock, metal, etc.). The case is also very durable and charges the earbuds when not in use (just don't forget to charge the case!). The earbuds pair almost immediately when taken out of the case - to each other and to my phone.Since I have only been using them for a couple of weeks, I will update my review after a couple of months to see how they have held up with a few hours of daily use. Lastly, while not apart of this product specifically, TOZO has offered to send me a wireless charging pad for free to be used with the earbuds (and any other wireless charging devices I have). I will update my review to include the wireless charging pad and charging capabilities/speed of the case.",5,1,2019-4-24,1,0,0

"I must have super-narrow ear canals, because I've gone through dozens of earbuds to find a good fit. I prefer the in-ear style, but most earbuds don't seal well, constantly fall out or need adjusting, etc. These TOZO ones are great because they come with different tip sizes (make sure you test with different sizes first-thing to find a good seal! It makes a big difference in noise cancellation.) They're also pretty lightweight, which means they don't pull out from gravity when I'm doing yoga in weird positions.Also...these are 100% worth the investment if you have a pet who loves to chew! One of my cats LOVES chewing up my headphone cables, which is obviously not a problem with the wireless style. I'm glad I spent $40 on these rather than go through cheap pair after cheap pair.

Every time Pressed the button It felt like the cushion was driving into my ear in a not pleasant way. The controls had a lot of vocal notifications but they were not too loud. but hearing Connected and such over my podcast was a little annoying. That being said at least I knew what was going on. That is not always the case with a Bluetooth headphone.  The one downfall I had was that it seemed like one of them was a master and the other was a slave. When I put the master away the other one would go quiet until it figured out what to do. I even tried pairing them separately and that did not seem to help. Maybe I paired them wrong, I'm not sure. they were going back regardless so I did not spend too much time with trying to figure it out. Thank you for reading! I hope this helps",4,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"We (I originally purchased these for my husband) received the product in a very timely fashion. Once I understood the instructions on pairing, everything else was a breeze. The sound quality is excellent. The product came with three choices (sizes) of earbud covers. One I choose the correct pair they were a perfect fit. The range is great and there was no fading in and out. Also came with a warranty which is a very good thing. All in all the product is great for the price.***UPDATE***UPDATE***UPDATE***UPDATE***",5,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"I was so excited to get these earbuds until I used them. I listen to audio books at work and wanted a better pair of bluetooth earbuds. I thought these would be it but I was so WRONG!!  While the sound quality is really good as well as the noice cancelling, they are not comfortable to wear for any extended length of time. I had the smalled earpiece and after an hour they started to become painful to wear. I am returning these and sticking with my less expensive earbuds!",1,1,2019-12-12,1,2,0
"update: I've had these for maybe a week now. I still love them, they work really well. However, I've noticed that when you move certain ways, audio cuts out. Like, when I bend over, my audio will cut and come back. I'm not sure if it's just mine and they're defective, or if this happens to all. Additionally, the mic hardly works, and every time I connect to my laptop, the headphones shut off with ""link loss"" and then dont connect again.I'm very happy with these headphones. Shipping took longer than expected, but they're wonderful. They come with many sizes of ear cuffs which is nice. I got the pink beige ones, and the color is really nice. they fit comfortably in my ears even with piercings. The charging case has a hook for keychain/pants which is awesome. The sound quality is great. They're easy to connect. They cancel out sound really well. The only odd thing is the absolutely terrifying robot voice when you press the buttons lol. They're honestly great, though.",3,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
"Owned these for several months, pretty happy with them. Battery life is reasonable, considering the size. The charging case is great, holds charge for a long time and recharges the earbuds multiple times before needing to be recharged itself. They fit my ears just fine, and stay in place without issue.One minor complaint is the length of time it takes for them to automatically connect when you turn them on. It's like 20-30s sometimes. Meanwhile, I have other bluetooth audio devices that connect almost instantly upon turning them on. Worth noting that these will connect instantly when you open your phone's BT settings and actually TELL it to connect to them - so it's not like they're just slow to connect, across the board - they just take their sweet time doing the auto-connect-to-the-last-device routine. Not a dealbreaker though, just a minor annoyance.",5,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
"When I first got these earbuds they worked fine.  I used them when running and riding my bike.  But then for some reason, out of nowhere, it became impossible to connect both earbuds by bluetooth.  I see this is a problem that other buyers have experienced as well.  I went online and found instructions on how to fix this problem and followed those instructions several times but the procedure still did not fix it.  It's too late for me to send them back so I am stuck with them.  In the first week that they worked, the volume was good and the mic was good.  I asked people that I was speaking to on the phone how they heard me and everyone responded that they were able to hear me good and clear.I tried using my PC, iPhone, and Samsung tablet and neither worked.  They were only able to connect to either the left or right earbud but not both simultaneously.",2,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
"These are a little more expensive, and were my first Bluetooth ear buds. Great sound quality, good depth on the bass, etc. They stay in the ear well, as long as they're properly rotated (as I found out the first time I was at the gym with them in!). My main problems with these are that I constantly had connection issues. They would magically shut off, and also magically unpair themselves, so it was a constant battle to get both of them to stay connected. The final straw was one day going to use them, and the right ear bud was completely dead; I haven't even owned these a year. Couldn't turn it on, couldn't charge, nothing. So, that's a good chunk of money out the window. :( I would definitely recommend these but because of the persistent connection dropping/unpairing issues, and the one ear bud dying grossly prematurely, I'd have to say spend your money elsewhere, or caveat emptor with these!",3,1,2019-11-23,1,2,0
I like the way the ear buds fit and feel.  They connect quickly and easily when removed from the case.  They fit snugly in my ears and don't seem like they will fall out when I sweat or move too much.There are 2 annoying things that make me question returning them and prevent me from giving 5 stars.,4,1,2019-2-19,1,1,0
"Brief : Pretty good overall but not for outdoor activities, for the quiet places.It was my first earbuds and I bought this for my workouts such as running, jogging and walk with my dog. But I realized that I failed at the first try. But I got some more experiments with same playlist to keep it. Here’s my results.",2,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"I purchased these after trying a similar set in the same price range. The sound on these is quite good, and the positioning in the ears can further isolate the ambient noice. They have proven to be waterproof, and secure when placed firmly in the ears. The charging case can charge the ear buds at least three times. I had to remove one star because the range is a bit limited, and the battery life on each charge is pretty low, at about 3 hours of playback. However, at this price point, the sound is comparable to ear buds at three times the cost, so the battery and range issues can be somewhat forgiven.",4,1,2020-3-6,1,1,0
"Wireless headphones are absolutely a step up from regular wired ones. It’s great to be working around the house or at my desk and not have to fuddle around with wires or have to keep my media device within arm’s reach.That being said, I don’t think outside of that these headphones are anything amazing. They go into your ears and play sounds. I don’t think the sound quality is any better than any other cheap pair of headphones I have ever owned, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. They get the job done. Same with noise cancellation, nothing special but it gets the job done.",4,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"So I recently bought these TWS Earbuds because my previous pair (different brand) were going the way of all man-made products, (they were dying).

"Overall these have proved great. I put them through the ringer today, dripping wet with sweat and running, and riding horses. Noise cancellation is great, better than I ever expected. Battery life isn't as long as competing products, which is really the only pitfall for me. The charging time makes up for that though and quickly gets them up and running again. Sound quality is very good, especially considering the price.In addition, I find myself as one of the ""lucky"" people who find keeping earbuds in place almost impossible. I had given up a while ago on finding something that didn't go up and around the outside of my ear. Due to reviews, I had to give these a shot. So excited because they stay! 4 different size ear pieces make it so you can find your perfect fit, and I was overjoyed.",5,1,2020-7-19,1,1,0
"I'm glad I didn't write a review immediately after I got these, because I would have given a 5 star rating given the price.The good... I love that the case has wireless charging and that works great. The earbuds lock in nicely as well. Overall, I think the construction is excellent given the price point. They hold a pretty decent charge too, and charge quickly when putting in them back in the case. The fact that they have Bluetooth 5.0 when some brand name competitors over $100 are still working with 4.2 is nice as well. This way they work great using them one at a time, or both in stereo. I used these in my office to listen to podcasts while I work, so they work great to charge one while listening on the other and then swap when the battery got low. Like I said, the battery strength was great, so I usually only had to swap once and it got me through the day!",1,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"I received the Tozo T10 today and I have to say so far the headphones are pretty great for the price. The headphones came ready to go immediately and I had them connected to my phone within seconds.I went ahead and queued up several genres of music and YouTube videos to see how they fare in terms of sound quality, noise cancellation and battery life.",5,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
"Sound is a great, I don't have any complains with the sound, super happy with it. The problem is the battery. The description of the products says ""4 hours' playtime from a single charge and 14 extra hours in the compact charging case"" I would say that the playtime is around 3.5h which is pretty close, but there's no way that the charging case will provide 14 extra hours, with just one charge there is just like 20% remaining battery in the charging case. Probably my charging case is defective, I will not return them because I use them just at work, so I can charge the case constantly.  But for everything else I prefer the Lasuney T30V, the battery on the Lasuney is way better, allowing me to charge the earplugs at least 4 or 5 times with the case. I expected more for the Tozo battery case with the ""14 extra hours"" description.",4,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
CAN IT BE WORTH KEEPING?----------------------------------------,3,1,2019-6-13,1,0,1
I purchased 2 pairs of these and while I love the design and the charging case I do have one pair that was extremely difficult to pair and was very susceptible to interference which lead to it cutting in and out all the time.  These were both paired with the same devices and used in the same situation just to make sure to eliminate any variables.  It was so annoying that they are going to be returned.  Also I found TOZO's customer service to be less than stellar.  I contacted them directly and they told me to pay to ship it back to them and they would replace it......while appreciated I am not sure why I should have to pay to return them.  Anyway the ones that work are good and in line with the many other reviews posted but just be weary that there is the possibility of receiving a dud.**Update** Tozo reached out to me and asked if they could send out a pair of their T6 earbuds for me to try and these solved my issues.  These performed much better when there was an environment with a heavy amount of bluetooth usage.  If you are going to use these for a place like the gym the try the T6s otherwise the T10  I still have has been working well.  Tozo also had no reason to reach out to me other than they wanted me to be satisfied so I give them a thumbs up now for customer service.,4,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"Just like everybody else has been saying, my earbuds wouldn’t connect to each other right out of the packaging, even after resetting them.  Really disappointed.

I bought this earphones due to the high reviews that I saw after damaging a different pair of earbuds. I have had these for less than two months and they are complete garbage.The charge doesn’t last very long. The battery pack loses battery even after your earbuds are completely charged. The Bluetooth connection range is poor. If I move a small distance away the earphones will disconnect AND to top it all off. I cannot for the life of me get the two earbuds to pair to one another. I have tried everything. I’ve read other reviews with similar issues and no real solution has been found. Only my left earbuds will connect and once connected the right one becomes useless. I am so unhappy with this product and I hope others will not fall for the high star ratings. There are much better earbuds (TANYA) around the same price and WAY BETTER. Save your money.,1,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"Easy to set up and battery life good but I just received my last pair and they were different. This is my 4th pair and all of the others Bluetooth link was ""tozo-t10"" and you could use left or right only without problems. This pair Bluetooth link is ""tozo-t10-r""  and you have to use the right one always otherwise it will disconnect. It also list in instructions that the right earbud is the ""master"" and the left one ""slave"". (These are completely different instructions than my previous pairs.) They shouldn't be sold as if the same product because to me that is a major difference. I don't wear both at the same time and my preferred one is the left earbud so this pair is a waste to me. I know some will say just swap right to the left ear but there are set features for each earbud. The left you can rewind.",1,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
"These are my first wireless earbuds.  I held off for a long time because I worried about them falling out, but after reading the reviews on these, I went for it, and I'm glad I did!  These things seat in solidly, and stay in place.  And while I don't actually work out with them, I think they'd be fine for that.I'm rather surprised at the sound quality.  It's better than I expected.  And the fit was perfect without even having to change the size.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0

"I really wanted to like these. I had issues pairing these, keeping the connection, and issues with the buds reconnecting after pairing. I would pull them out of the case and they would simply beep at me, it would take upwards of a minute to pair to the phone and I had to go into my bluetooth settings to reconnect a known device. No reason for this. The sound was decent, bass was decent but it seems that the vacuum seal when they twisted into my ears caused instant headaches from the pressure. Didn't even know this was a thing as my other in ear headphones do not cause this problem. But some research on Google confirmed I'm not the only one to have this problem. Earbuds also do not work independently of each other. There are questions and answers on here that are mixed about this but I can confirm they do not work this way.",2,1,2019-4-30,1,1,0
"OH MY WORD THESE ARE AMAZING!!!! I’ve never even wanted wireless headphones. I always thought they were dumb, but at the gym, it’s so hard to lift weights with the headphone cord so I decided to buy these thinking they won’t be great but at least I won’t have to deal with the cord...the feel of the box and the earbuds are fantastic and feel very high quality. I love that they charge in their case without the case being plugged in.  Maybe I live under a rock, but I had to jump on immediately to give a review. I was already loving them and then I played them and holy heck!!!! On the lowest volume on my iPhone, they were plenty loud and noise cancelling!! On a medium volume, it was like I was in a rock concert. I can’t even tell you how excited I am to go to the gym tmrw!!!!!! I’ll update the review if they don’t work well with exercise. I’m a big runner so I’m praying they stay in on my run tmrw. I will be so thrilled!!!! I’ll update again. MUST BUY!!",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"I love these buds, I take them everywhere. I’m glad it included the strap to be able to carry it with me as I’m a very forgetful and distractible person so it helps with not losing the case. I have definitely more than once been close to losing the individual buds but I’ve ended up using the range to help me center where in a room it fell. Very nifty and convenient. I love being able to shower with them and go on a jog without annoying wires flying around. The noise cancellation is my favorite feature as I have trouble sleeping lately and these help me drown out the outside noises. Definitely would recommend or purchase for the perfect gift for anyone who listens to anything from their devices. I recently picked up dancing with myself and no matter to much I shake my head or jumó around, they stay put in my little, tiny ears. Great purchase! Would definitely buy again.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,1
Was expecting decent sound based on the reviews but didn't really care just wanted something for working out/swimming that would work.

I love the magnetic slots in the case and these earbuds are great because you can use just one if you are on a phone call or need to keep an ear open.Sound quality is above average... the best of any off-brand pair I've purchased.

"Got these great earbuds for my 15 year old Daughter as a Birthday gift. She wanted wireless earbuds, as she likes to run daily with these in her ears. Some pros and cons: they really STAY in place-no falling out while running or moving around. They are also extremely comfortable, and do not make your ears sore. The two main cons, (after asking my teen) were that the sound quality isn't as good as her wired earbuds, but not so bad that she won't use them. It's not terrible, and she can live with it. Her biggest complaint was the battery life-you get about two full hours before they have to be recharged (since my daughter listens to a lot of music for long lengths of time, it's probably understandable). Because of this, having a wireless charger for these would really be beneficial, especially if you travel frequently, or wear them for extended periods of time, like my daughter does. Overall, I'd recommend these, as they are nice, comfortably fitting earbuds, and for a great price. Much better than spending over $100 on Airpods.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"I really like this headset with the noise cancelling, sound quality and wireless charging of the case. However, the individual Bluetooth synching of each bud is poorly executed. It requires individual synching with each use. Often times when you get one bud synched and working, by the time the second one connects the first one disconnects from my phone and then immediately disconnects the second one. This is an every morning routine and i have to put it back in the case to reset for a few seconds before trying again. It typically works the second time - but it is very annoying and a pain to do each time.The one I had before (older model that did not do individual synching) had zero issues and worked flawlessly for 2 years.",1,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0

Oh my goodness!  I am blown away by these headphones and the price.  The sound quality on these is superb.  For those of you who are bass heads like me buy these without any doubts.  I listen mainly to dubstep and the bass on this blows your mind.  They are also so clear.  Overall great earbuds.  Not much in the way of noise cancelleation but hey you're paying $40 bucks.  You want ANC get the Sonys over the ear headphones.  Call quality is ok not the best but ok.

The person didn’t try it on so that was the extent of it.I got mine 30 min ago. Unboxed it and it had all the components and it was packed as I had watched and it does have a quality product feel about it.

"....however that whole ""stay connected"" thing is a bit hit-and-miss. While walking around, the connection drops every 30 seconds or so. There's just a half-second of silence multiple times a minute. It's incredibly annoying. When sitting at a desk, it seems to be more stable, but at that point I'd just wear wired earbuds and not worry about the battery life.My other gripe is that there aren't proper functions on the buds themselves. A single press is play/pause, naturally, but double-tapping the only button is a Redial button, rather than a skip button like other single-button controls. Holding the button turns off the earbud. I don't get it, but since I don't have a wire to work around, whipping out my phone to change the music doesn't bother me so much.",3,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"As of now, these things are useless. I will charge the case until it is full (all 4 solid lights), and then stick them in my backpack until I need them. Two days later, the case and buds are dead. Rinse and repeat, always the same thing. If you fully charge them, and then use them, they seem to hold a charge for a bit. But, left unused in a backpack, turned off, connected to nothing, they apparently drain insanely fast.A couple of months later, the issue has not improved. I looked into everything I could to stop them from draining while idle. Nothing helps. I charge them fully, leave them alone, and a week later, the case and buds are dead, without having even used them. Either the product itself is faulty, or I got bad ones.",1,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
2nd Update: the seller sent me a second pair that are far better than the original ones I got. I only hear an occasional bit of static or dropout in signal.  These earbuds seem to be a lot louder and have better Bass. For these reasons I'm upgrading my review the four stars especially because the seller is very concerned about making sure the customers are satisfied.***UPDATE: The sellers are clearly bribing customers for good reviews by sending you an email offering a free charger in return for a good review. I've used the earbuds a few times now and the static just keeps coming back. All I have to do is put my hand near my face and I get static and lose connection in one ear.

"I truly wanted these to be the answer to my personal office music situation. First the good... These are very reasonably priced. The sound produced is better than expected for the price paid. The concept of a case that recharges it's earbuds multiple times without having to re-plug these into a recharging USB port is great. The recharging time is very fast when compared to the amount of time that you receive playing music. Now the bad... I had hoped to be able to plug the case into a wall outlet rather than a USB port for charging purposes. Not a deal breaker but it would have been nice. Next, the instructions that I received do not list all options; for example, how to turn off the earbuds. Not a deal breaker as I eventually figured this out on my own. Finally... these are extremely uncomfortable regardless which set of earcaps I used (S, M, L or XL). I had to use the small sized earcaps as none of the other sizes would stay in my ears. With the small earcaps, I was able to get them to stay as long as I sat at my desk and didn't make any sudden movements, but after about an hour, these earbuds became very uncomfortable. I need something that I can wear for 8 hours without discomfort. This was my deal breaker.",3,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0

Until this issue is fixed I would steer clear unless you will use these often enough that you will plug the case in frequently as in its current form the case is useless.Sound quality is between good and decent but one bud seems to have issues.",2,1,2020-1-13,1,1,0
"Overall, great wireless eat buds. Sound was good with some bass but the high treble sounds muted. They fit snug in my ear and didn't fall out walking about.

"First off, the sound quality on these earphones is surprisingly good. The bass especially. I didn't expect that from wireless Bluetooth headphones at this price range. Unfortunately, they were a bit big for my ears, so I wrote an unfavorable review. Unexpectedly, I was contacted by Tozo out of the blue who apologized for the negative experience I had and offered to refund me or send me an upgraded version of the earphones. This caught me completely off guard. How often have YOU been contacted by a company to address an issue you had? A company that stands behind their product (a Chinese company, I assume, which makes it even MORE surprising) definitely has my respect.Phenomenal customer service. 5 stars. If I decide to buy another pair of affordable earphones in the near future, I will definitely consider Tozo, and you probably should too.

I'm mesmerized, with just the press of the right side of the Tozo T10 earbud I can answer calls (call quality is awesome), pause my music and resume and for me, this is priceless.  I love the easiness to pair with my phone and the wireless charge box aspect, it really sets it apart from other brands, The case the earbuds stay in is genius!

So I was a little skeptical about making a purchase  for ear buds like these only because I know my self and it's only a matter of time I misplace one taking them out on the fly or one falls out do to my clumsy nature with that I would rate myself 3 stars .  But back on track here.I've only used them for about 5 days and am quite the  sound snob when it comes to listening to music.  Ive had a pair of blue tooth headphones before but they were true wireless the bud style was similar but a tiny core wrapped around your neck . So for starters,5,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
"These headphones are so nice, I literally bought a pair, lost one of the buds, bought another pair, lost the buds to that one, and then finally I bought the 3rd pair which I hope I never lose any part of it. This d**n company has swindled me for 150 dollars and I'd gladly buy another pair to put that number at a solid 200 dollars.First of all, these headphones are proof you don't need to pay 100 plus dollars for AirPods.

I will wear them for an hour hike and put them back in the charge box and then won’t use them again for a week or two and when I open the box, the box and the headphones are completely dead. I don’t know if I have a faulty pair or what, but I have to plus these in every single time I’m done using them, even if I only used them for an hour or two.",3,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"First off, these earbuds are amazing! I did my research and bought a pair for my daughter in law for her birthday. She loves them! They're super comfortable to wear and sound great! So a few months later, I bought two more as Christmas gifts. Both sets of earbuds worked flawlessly; however, 1 of the cases would not charge. I sent off a support request via email, and Becky got back with me promptly, offering to send me a replacement case. The replacement case arrived and, low and behold; it would also not charge. So I informed Becky of our dilemma, and she apologized for the issue and promptly sent out a whole new set (earbuds and case) which have arrived & work great! Mind you, our last interaction happened right at the tail end of the extended Chinese New Year, and during a nationwide health crisis due to the coronavirus. That's unbelievable customer service! Thank you so much, Becky! I will be ordering more products from TOZO in the future!",5,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"Great sound and volume but the headphones keep cutting out on the left side. It’s very annoying!I don’t know if this is common or I’ve got a busted pair. If I cover the right side with my hand it kills the signal. I’ve noticed if I move my head in certain ways, like drinking a beverage, they cut out. They even cut out if I tilt my head sometimes.",1,1,2019-9-12,1,3,0
"I use these while working out.  They work nicely and were easy to pair with my phone. The sound quality is pretty good, it doesn't block out everything but I can hear well even over the canned music in the gym. I love the case, it keeps them secure in my gym bag while also charging them for the next use.  I have always had trouble with earbuds; due to allergies, my ear canals are often irritated and sometimes swollen.  I have had a little trouble keeping them in my ear for this reason.  Although, the more I use them, the better they seem to fit.  I worked out yesterday and they did not fall out but I don't run either, only walking and weight lifting. I think I would have more difficulty during more strenuous exercise like running or aerobics. Because I only use them when working out, I tend to forget I have them until then so I haven't taken the time to try the different sizes of earpieces, that may make a difference. I will try to update this review when I do so.",4,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"I haven't had these for long but they have done what I've wanted so far. I bought them for when I kickbox because my headphones slide off my head. These stay tight in my ear. They sound nice and connect well with my phone. The charger is cool and the have a sleek look. I've already dropped one on hardwood and it did not damage. Very good quality so far.Update: my pair started malfunctioning. When they were powered off and in the charging case they began turning on by themselves and connecting to my phone. I would try to watch a video on my phone and wonder why the sound wasn't working. Then I saw that my phone had connected to the ear buds that were put away in the case. So I would get up and turn the ear buds off and believed that I had only forgotten to turn them off when I first put them away. But that wasn't true. Somehow the ear buds kept turning on and reconnecting to my phone. The problem became an inconvenience, but I contacted customer support. Since I had registered for the extended warranty, Tozo is sending me a new pair.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
The sound quality is not the best I have heard but is definitely very good with good bass and range of sounds. Noise cancelling is pretty good. Can barely hear somebody talking to me with the earbuds in. This is my first set of truly wireless earbuds. I really like the freedom but they do not stay in my ear as good as I had hoped. I followed the directions and are using the biggest rubber piece. I usually use these for running. They will stay in my ear pretty well but have to reset them in my ear every few minutes. I did have one Fallout the other day because I did not catch it early enough. That would discourage me from using these for mountain biking or snowboarding. I am quite a sweater and my ears get pretty wet so not all may have this problem. My biggest problem with these is the connectivity. I can set my phone down and walk across the gym with very good connectivity but when I put the phone against my body like a pocket they have a hard time staying connected. The first set I got were really bad. I called for tech support and they had me try a couple Placebo type fixes that did not seem to work. I returned them for another set and the second set seem to work much better but still have issues if I have my phone in my pocket. I usually run with a waste belt that holds my phone and this seems to work much better.,4,1,2019-6-26,1,0,0
"So the only negative thing I have to say about these is that they do tend to slip out often. Mostly when im eating lunch at work, they just start falling out and I have to catch them and put them back in. While im at my workstation I can feel them slipping out from time to time.Now the positive - These little things sound amazing! I listened to a few movies now with these while I was working and they made me feel like I was actually at the theaters with how great it sounded! I got a couple coworkers who like to sing (badly) while they work and these definitely blocked them out very well. As for the battery life, I work 12hr shifts and these have lasted the entire day without an issue.",4,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"Horrible sound quality, couldn’t hear the caller at full volume inside my very quiet apartment. Music sound quality is just as bad and there is no base, contrary to the description.Completely ridiculous return process! The return instructions are longer than the items description.

"I've always used regular earbuds with my phone to listen to podcasts or music while I mow the lawn. The Pixel 3 came with no headphone jack, and the USB earbuds that came with it rest in your ear , rather than actually sticking in the ear and 'sealing'. In addition, the USB headphones don't work with the belt case I have for it, so I needed to consider other options.  I was a bit wary of these, my concerns being if they would be loud enough and 'seal' against the ear hole well enough to cover the noise of the mower, and secondly whether they would stay put. Ultimately I was very pleased, and honestly surprised how well they stayed once you got them right (not REAL easy, but I'm glad it's POSSIBLE to take the time and get them seated perfectly).  In addition, while I wouldn't mind if they were able to go a hair higher, I don't know that I'll ever actually need it any higher, I just like a little headroom. But both music and podcast were plenty loud and full, and came through clearly over the mower noise that did get past the seal.The case is great too, charges on my 'Pixel Stand' (wireless charger) and for those who like me didn't find it clear from the description, it DOES have a USB charging port in the case and includes a USB cable. It ALSO allows wireless charging while in the case, which is a nice touch for the price. They're $50 headphones any day of the week, even without the wireless charging, so including that is great, and will become even more handy as wireless chargers become ubiquitous.",5,1,2019-4-23,1,0,0
I love my wireless T10’s. I was worried that the low price meant I had to sacrifice something in the quality. I was wrong!! These headphones are amazing!! They are comfortable to wear. I have small ears and most earbuds hurt when I use them. I was able to adjust the tozo t10’s to the smallest size and I can wear them for several hours at a time. The sound quality is amazing. I use them at work and while exercising and have no problems keeping them in. I am able to answer the phone while listening to music. I love that they are completely wireless. There are no cords hanging on my desk while working. Definitely a great pair of headphones and totally worth buying!!,5,1,2019-7-9,1,1,1
"I contacted customer service about this and after attempting to do an easy ""reset"" of the earbuds, they still didn't work. The company sent me a new pair.  Like I said below, they are super easy to pair and work.  I link them both with my Ipad and Iphone and connectivity is automatic.  Sound is great.  I am now a very happy customer.They were great at first.  Pairing was super easy, with one or two buds, great sound and charging...but now , after about 3 months I am getting a high pitched chirping sound every so often.  Totally random, No rhyme or reason to it, happens when paired to my IPhone or IPad, low battery or full.  They are driving me crazy!  AND I can't find a way to contact the seller to ask them if they will replace.  I paid $ 38 for these and am not happy!  In the trash they go.",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"***Update: Returned original pair for replacement. Second pair do not have the issue of left bud losing connection...but the pair will cut out on occasion. There seems to be a Bluetooth connection issue with TOZO.There is an issue with my left pod not staying connected. Initially, right then left will connect but then the left pod cuts out constantly.  I thought it was a WiFi/streaming issue.  Then I thought it was only happening when I was moving around.  I am sitting perfectly still at the moment and the left bud is cutting in and out.  I cannot recommend these buds at this time.",3,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
"I hate talking on the phone without an earpiece—I have going back to landlines which blessedly began to feature a plug for wired earpieces, which I immediately took advantage of using. When I recently upgraded to iPhone 11, decided to go wireless.Between top-notch ratings and one of the best sellers, plus an exceptional price, I figured it should do the job. And it largely has.",4,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"Like many others have said, these have a lot of problems, but that can be expected at this price point. I didn't intend to use these for calls, but any device in this space should have call quality as a primary feature.Frequent disconnects from paired device well within Bluetooth range if not in direct line of sight (very spotty if my phone is in my back pocket, for instance).",2,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"UPDATE: Since I had a serious problem with my initial pair of these earbuds, the manufacturer quickly sent me a replacement set that did not have the battery problem of my first set. In the interim, I acquired a different set of similar earbuds from a different manufacturer. As a result, I have what I didn't have the first time I wrote about these: a basis for comparison. My overall experience is that although I don't own a perfect set of waterproof Bluetooth earbuds, this one is much more reliable.THE GOOD",4,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0
"The pros so far: the charging case works great, and I like that the earbuds turn on or off when you pull them out or put them back into the case.  They also paired with my phone and my computer right away.  And the sound is nice and clear when I'm listening to my regular list of podcasts.  Good vocal resonance, and sharp, static-free sound.My uncertainties so far: First, I know they're waterproof, but I've tried every earplug adapter that shipped with the earbuds, and none provide that tight fit I was expecting that would provide a watertight seal for, say, swimming.  Even after twisting them into position, I'm not convinced they won't fall out.  But for now I'm only wearing them on land, and they're staying in place when I'm just walking around.  Second, I have a pair of over-ear Sony noise cancelling headphones, and they really do block out most of the ambient sound.  These TOZO earbuds don't even remotely approach the Sony's noise cancellation, but they also cost less than 1/3 as much, plus they're not over-ear.  So I'm thinking they may be a nice solution for those times when I merely want to reduce but not eliminate ambient sound.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"I needed waterproof buds, as the primary time these are used is during physical exertion.First time in use, the buds were working well...except, the left bud, apparently worked too far loose, and plopped into a bucket of water.  I retrieved it immediately and turned the system ""off""...waited for it to dry, and, tried again.  It worked, but after some time (less than a day's typical use) the left earbud began to intermittently lose connectivity (bluetooth).  Put up with this for a few days, then contacted TOZO Customer Service.  They responded asking that I do a manual reset.  After the 'reset', they worked well for a number of hours...but, by the following day, were back into 'intermittent-signal-loss' mode.  I tried 'reset'ting again, then again and then, once more...to no avail.  Contacted Customer Service again - was informed that TOZO was interested in my 5-Star satisfaction...but wanted me to write a review 'first'...",5,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"The earbuds turned out to be a too tinny to even listen to a TV with. I wasn't expecting excellent sound from a $35 pair of earbuds. I was expecting good sound from a product tens of thousands of reviewers rated at five stars. Based on their primary purpose and not taking into account their selling price, the earbuds I received deserve a 2 star rating. If I take into account the price I paid, they deserve 3 stars. Leaves me to wonder why those other reviewers rated them so high. I don't think they were making a sound decision.I decided to send them back immediately after listening to them.",2,1,2020-8-19,1,1,0
"I picked up a pair of these wireless earbuds as my 2nd dip into the crowded pool of wireless earbuds.  I previously used another brands wireless earphones, the kind with the cable between the two earbuds, and then bluetooth to the phone.  They worked great for almost 2 years, and only recently started to not hold a charge anymore.  I think i paid $20 for them on a Lightning deal, so i call that a win.  So when it came time to buy a replacement, i started doing some research online.  I landed on another brands earbuds, one could say maybe a more well known brand.  I bought them direct from the brands site.  When i received them all seemed great, good fit and finish, but when i started using them in the gym they kept dropping connection from the left and right earbud.  I followed all the instructions from there help forums and all that, no luck.  So after many resets, re pairs, and firmware updates i gave up and sent them back.  As soon as i did that i did some more digging and came across these TOZO earbuds.  First off, i had no idea who TOZO was, as there seems to be a million companies making similar earbuds, with all sorts of claims.  But, i was in need of some earbuds, and the price was good, and the reviews looked solid.  So i ordered them up, knowing if they did not work, i could just return them via Amazon.  Well, to my surprise, they work amazing.  They worked right out of the box, super easy pairing, build quality seems great for the price.  Sound quality is actually really good.  I can not really comment on battery life, but they have not needed to be charged in over a weeks of daily use, but that is also the case charging them.  These little guys are a great value, you are not paying for a name and marketing.  Give them a shot, i am pretty sure you will like them, and if you don't, return them and find one that does .",5,1,2019-2-26,1,0,0
"I’m very pleased with these. And because I had a hard time confirming this before purchase: YES these work with an iPhone 5c and an iPhone 5s.I love that they turn on automatically when you take them out of the case. The info booklet could be better. Once you take the right one out, you need to take the left one out soon enough for them to connect together. (I waited too long and then they connected to my computer as separate devices.)",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"They're nice looking. Very small and portable. Upon receiving I looked in the little box the cord was in and unfortunately the ear caps that were also supposed to be in there were not. The ones that came on it don't really seal well for me. I'm hoping changing the ear caps will fix this because I also felt like the big piece that's supposed to cradle in your ear is too big for mine. Emailed customer service and they are mailing me ear caps so we'll see on that.My biggest issue with these is that I had gotten them for work, even figuring 6.5 hours of play time like I read other people stating they got would be adequate. I charged them all day in the case on a wireless charging pad, case showed four blue lights, but 3.5 (!) hours into my shift and the right headphone was beeping and quietly saying ""low battery"" under my music. Ten minutes later they shut themselves off. I'd charge them in the case intermittently for 15-20 minutes at a time and they'd last for at least as long playing music again, but I was just so shocked when I got a low battery alert before my first break",1,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
"This is the second set of Tozo earbuds I have purchased.  I have one set for my personal cell phone and the second set for my company cell.  The personal cell phone set is used for working out and outdoor activities, which includes exercising in the rain.  The earbuds work great and the rain and sweat have not negatively impacted the earbuds in any way.  For my company phone, I use the earbuds for hours at a time on conference calls, the BlueTooth connection has remained constant.  Where my peers are dropping in an out of the calls my earbuds have provided great clarity on the mic and the speakers (earbuds) have provided great sound quality.

Barely heard the box fan with out having to adjust the ear bud volume. My son came and asked me a question..couldn’t hear him, again the volume was not blaring.",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"I got these to replace MPow Flame earbuds.  Sound quality is great - I'm really pleased given the price point - deep, full sound with excellent bass for podcasts and rock/pop.  Battery life is around 4 hours...but even when I listen for long periods of time, I usually take short brakes,and by placing the buds back in the case they charge quickly without having to plug the case in, which is very convenient and helps extend battery life.  Workouts and sweat proofing - I sweat a lot.  I've historically used buds with ear hooks so that they stay in place during workouts, but the cord was always annoying as it tended to pull on one of the buds.  After several weeks, these have been great against resisting sweat.  The only thing that I would improve upon would be to include the large foam ear tips (see photo) with the earbuds.  For my ears, even with the largest of the rubber tips, the earbuds tended to fall out when my ears were sweaty, which is similar to my experience with other earbuds.  Once I swapped to the foam tips, I got a better seal that no longer falls out when at maximum sweat.  If you are looking for earbuds for running/workouts, these are the way to go!",5,1,2019-9-17,1,0,1
"I'm kinda blown away that these earbuds are so good for such a low price. Especially since all the big names are charging $200-$250 for a pair of wireless earbuds. They connect almost instantly. The sound is great. They do somewhat cancel noise even though they aren't noise canceling. They come with a charging cord (no charging brick), a battery case, and four pairs of earbud cups for the ends of the buds. The ones it comes fitted with from the factory were adequate but I ended up putting the next size larger on. Haven't had any real problems with them. Maybe they cut out for a second once or twice since I bought them. Who knows what kinda interference there might have been from other electronics nearby. They regularly give me 4-5 hours of play time before they have to go back in the charging case for a bit. The box they come in looks high quality and they are packaged nicely if that's your thing.",5,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0
"These are great earbuds.  In fact these are the 3rd set i have ordered, but the first set i have used.  I have given 2 as gifts and they love them. The audio quality is amazing.  They are also extremely easy to setup.  For cellphone or audio playback these are ideal.  They come with extra sizes for the ear to ensure they fit your ear.  My ear canals are small, but their small adapters were a perfect fit and they stay snug in my ear.  The only issue i got these to watch tv.  I purchased a bluetooth converter for the tv and they synced right up.  However, since the earbuds do not have volume controls built into them, the audio was too loud from the tv.  By design and as a preference, the tv remote only controls the volume of the tv.  this allows you to mute the tv but still be able to listen to the audio independently on your speakers.  So i ended up giving these to my wife and I purchased the T6 model.  They are exactly the same as these with a smaller case and volume controls built into the earbuds.  Both versions have a great case that allow you to recharge the earbuds and also the case itself can be recharged via wireless chargers.  For the price, both versions the T10s and the T6s, are great earbuds.  thanks!",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
After the 3rd pair I received I finally received 1 that works.I purchased a set and the right bud did not work at all. The 2nd pair Amazon sent me had good sound quality but I would receive interference and it would on get every other word in the song.,5,1,2019-5-28,1,2,0
"I'm immensely pleased with this purchase. I've had trouble in the past finding earbuds that were comfortable in my ears (especially anything Apple-made). These earbuds are comfortable and snug, and it includes different-sized heads to ensure you find a right fit.Given the price compared to the features included in this product, I was worried there would be obvious sacrifices in audio quality. Nope! I'm no audiophile, but the sound is crisp. I've previously bought cheaper wireless headphones on Amazon in the $20 range, and there's a world of difference between these high-quality speakers and some of the cheaper options out there.",5,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
Edit: Batteries in the earbuds may be defective or are just not that great. Earbud batteries do not hold a charge very well and often died during a workout. Contacted seller twice and never received a response. Returning to Amazon for a refund.Wow! I was impressed with how well these sounded when I popped them in. Great bass in these small buds. They are easy to pair with multiple devices and you can power them off by pressing the outer button on the right side.,2,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"These ear buds sound good if you can get them deep enough into your ears, which gets uncomfortable to me within an hour or so. My biggest complaint is that once you step outside the left ear bud drops signal constantly. I assume without walls to bounce off of the Bluetooth pairing is just not powerful enough to make it through my thick skull? Will be returning and trying another brand.",2,1,2019-2-22,1,6,0
"Had to use the smallest ear bud and even then I think I need smaller somehow, start hurting after about an hour of use wether it's reading/walking or lifting weights. They connected right away to my phone, no problem.Came charged already which was nice.",4,1,2020-7-10,1,0,1
"Great look and packaging. I really love the look! The case is absolutely sleek and good looking! The sound is excellent. Very crisp and clear. I mostly listen to audio books. I have hearing loss so I need headphones that are very crisp in order to understand everything without full blast volume and these are excellent. I've only had them one day and the battery life has been great today. They are very easy to pair and use. They work perfectly on my phone and on my tablet. The buttons work great for taking calls, hanging up, and redialing.Didn't get five stars because as I said before I've had them one day and they fell out many times. Two times one of the other fell all the way to the floor. I've never had this issue with other ear wear. I tried all the silicone plug sizes but no luck.  I don't like that it has no volume control on the actual ear buds.",4,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"Battery life is 2-3 hours, which is what I expected. Occasionally, if the music is stopped, it'll disconnect and say so but reconnect right away; I don't know why it does that, but it never happens when the audio is actually going, which is good obviously. As a headset for phone calls, I've had no complaints of sound quality or volume from the one I'm speaking to; the mic is on the right earpiece, just be aware of that. The case is a battery, too, and it charges well enough.I haven't used it to work out or run long distances with, but with sporadic running and the daily commute/walking, I fidget with placement a few times, no more than regular headphones I've used before. I think it comes with other-sized earpieces, but I used the ones that were pre-attached. These protrude from the ears so that changing t-shirts with these on can dislodge them.",5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"Great Quality.  Great Battery Life.  Great Sound. . . . .But.  They fall out ALL THE TIME.  If they could fix this the product would be perfect.  Takes me roughly hour and a half to mow the lawn.  They fall out roughly 8-10 times during that time just walking.  If you plan any activity at all other than just sitting at your desk they will come out constantly.  That said, when I do use them at the office they stay in fine as long as I am just doing desk work and don't get up and walk around.  Very Irritating though when I am mowing and have to look through the lawn for them when they fall completely out.",3,1,2020-8-2,1,2,0
"Overall these headphones are great. They pair without fail to my phone every time I pull them out. The earbuds stay in your ear very well unless you get absolutely drenched in rain or sweat. Only then might they slide around a little, but I've never had them fall out on a run or during a workout. I'm no audiophile, so I won't comment on sound quality, and I mainly desired convenience with this purchase. They fulfill that purpose very well.My only complaint is that the right and left earbuds can lose their sync very easily sometimes. With my phone in my pocket (therefore being only a few feet away from the headphones), just a turn of the head can cause the left earbud to stop playing. This doesn't happen every time you turn your head, but it has happened often enough that I've been able to turn my head back and forth to test this multiple times. The audio may only quit for a second or two, and turning your head back always fixes it, but it's a slightly annoying problem.",4,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"I generally don't do many reviews, but reviews helped me decide on these.

"Overall the TOZO T10 bluetooth ear buds work great. After researching and comparing which wirelesss ear buds to buy, I decided with these primarily for the sound quality and comfort. The audio quality surpassed my expectations as I thought most bluetooth headphones audio aren't the best. Battery life of the earbuds is typical but they charge real fast like other reviewers stated on here. Bluetooth 5.0 works great and at work I am able to walk 30 ft away from the phone with cubical walls up. Some issues I experienced is the poor microphone quality. It does not isolate the surrounding noises which makes it impossible for the other person to understand what I am saying which to me was a big important feature to me. Otherwise these headphones are great for listening to music.",4,1,2019-5-26,1,1,0
"I've had these headphones for about two months now and at first they were great. The sound quality is fine if you're going to the gym or like a lot of bass but don't expect Sennheiser or Bose quality here. Having fully wireless earbuds is convenient and considering the Bose wireless earbuds cost much more these are definitely a good buy. My only problem is that they disconnect constantly on my S10+ when I have my watch paired to my phone as well. My other issue is that if you're like me and work in an office, you like to keep one earphone out in case of a phonecall or something and you go to put the left earbud in, it doesn't automatically turn on. You need to put the right one back in the case for a second, pull it out and then both will work. I'm not sure how other fully wireless earbuds work in this regards but having to do this is a nuisance.  Overall these aren't bad for the price you pay and for a simple pair you can wear to the gym and not have to worry about having $200+ in your ears.UPDATE: issue seems to be with my samsung watch interfering and customer service confirmed they can only connect to one device at a time so changing my review from 3-4 stars",1,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"(4/10/2020) Maybe it's my ears, but the right bud just won't stay in. It slips out as soon as I start running. The worst part is that the music cuts out often. It's as if the ear buds keep pausing and then resuming music by themselves.They're fine ear buds for the price. If gyms were open, I think they'd be ideal for use indoors.",1,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"I wanted these to be awesome and they just weren’t. First, the case goes through battery like crazy. I only get about 3 earbud charges out of it. It might not sound that bad, but I’m usually only listening to the buds for 20 mins at a time. I have used them until the buds battery was going out, but that was only an hour. (Several test runs, they only last about an hour off charger) They also fit weird in the ear. It’s a nice light bud, but you basically have to corkscrew it into your ear to get just the right fit. If it slightly moves, you lose the noise cancellation and it begins to slip out of the ear. They are more of a square fit, so it just doesn’t feel comfortable in the ear. Unless I’m wrong and the only person without square ears. And I HATE that I can’t change the music. It almost seems more geared toward using it as solely phone calls.",2,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
"Perfect 👌 exactly what I wanted, super fast delivery 👍 ordered on Thursday afternoon and received em by Saturday afternoon 😁.

The Earbuds are touch and the charging carrier are both water proof which is a big plus where I live. Washington rains all the time, So I'll be putting that Waterproof to the test 🤞.. It comes with all the things you need, a few sets of different size ear buds, a charger cord and a lanyard to take on the go.  The charger case came with the headphones fully charged and the case as well. Easy to follow instructions and a warranty as you'll see when you open it. Nice solid  quality product and great price 👌. So far so good, will update later to tell how they are after more use.  Would definitely buy again and recommend them!",5,1,2020-7-4,1,0,1
I bought these to replace a pair of generic air-pods that hurt my ears and were not very comfortable.These ear buds are a huge improvement. They are comfortable. They come with multiple different size ear pieces. The sound quality is great. I've used them for phone calls and Facetime and no complaints about being heard. You can use just the right alone if needed.,3,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
"Soooo.... Below this rant is the original review for my first pair... Since then, the company replaced these because they were not holding a charge.  Well after my replacements charger case wouldn't hold a charge for long the ""Upgraded"" me to the T6's.  Lets just say ""Waterproof"" is a huge understatement!!  The T6's volume goes on the fritz as soon as the water hits the earbud, eventually turning off entirely.  I can't even review the T6's because they were replacement for my initial purchase of the T10s.  I decided to give them another chance and bought another pair of T10's.  Well they failed to live u to the ""Water proof"" claim as well!  After using them in the shower(not submerging) a handful of times, they started to randomly turn off until they dried out.  I tried calling customer support with no luck getting a person.  Hopefully this can be corrected but we will see.ORIGINAL POST------>  Don't let the cheap price fool you, these are great quality!  If you do have an issue, they are quick to respond and correct the problem to your satisfaction.",1,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"These are amazing! I had the last version of these (the T8) and loved them as well, but these are more comfortable and sound a little bit better (the others sounded excellent). Multiple sizes of cushions, and when you select the correct size they STAY in place, no worries of them falling out. LOTS of bass, very clear and awesome sound. I would absolutely recommend these! Havent tested battery life to the limits, but I fell asleep with them in and they were still playing when I woke up at least two hours later. The case on the T10 is MUCH better quality than the T8 (the previous version). I assume they will charge the headphones a ton before needing to plug them in just based on the size of the case. I have owned JLab, JBL (2 versions), Sony and a couple of other major name brands and these are superior. OH and the ""ok Google/hey google"" function actually works great as well! The microphone for calling is OK, but it IS far from your mouth and with that in mind it is great. I only got these because TOZO customer service gave me half off for warranty purposes from my T8 version I loved (charging issue). They swapped out the charging case (fast shipping too!) to see if that would solve my problem, but it didnt, and they offered replacement or half off the new headset. Excellent FAST customer service. I had low expectations with an ""off brand"" headset, but I'm a customer for as long as they keep producing quality headphones.",5,1,2019-4-12,1,0,1
"Update: was contacted by the seller and offered a new set. I can’t speak to the quality of the new set but the customer service is excellent. Will update again on the new set. Old one was possibly defective.Got the new set in the mail today. They sent me the T6 headset. After a quick charge I pairs them which was effortless. And made a phone call. Quality was acceptable on both ends. After a quick swap of earpieces they stay in my ear securely. The sound is better than the last ones but still lacks the low end, not surprising considering the size. Overall sound quality is good. Not a super high end set but a good buy. Tozo has great customer service.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"So I got a pair of these for using at work. I do remodel/construction so I move around a lot and it can get noisy. I was using wired ear buds running the wire inside my shirt to my phone in my back pocket.. of coarse they always ended up failing at the jack where you have bend the wire just right to get them to work. Plus it isn't always practical to have a phone in your back pocket getting sweaty, dirty, crawling through an attic etc.. and you can't put your phone aside for a couple minutes and still use your wired ear buds. So I ended up buying these on a lightning deal from Amazon. As an aside, they arrived the very next day which always amazes me about Amazon. Anyways, I opened the charging case and took them out and they connected in seconds, no connect buttons to push no hesitation, just bam there they were. So I  brought them to work the next day for their first real test and by the end of the day I wanted another pair of these. I listen to am talk radio all day practically. My first show starts at 9 a.m. and ends at 12 next is 12 to 3 and then 3 to 6. Yes they have 3 hour battery time but that's actually better in my opinion for me all day at work. The thing is I turn them on at 9 exactly and 3 hours and literally 9 minutes later I got my first warning that the batteries needed to be charged. Exactly what they promised. The reason I think this is better is because for this price compared to most other bluetooth earbuds I can buy two sets of these and then when one gets low on battery I put them in the charger and pop in the ones that are already charged and I never have any down time while I recharge. Most of the wireless earbuds I looked at have a 4 to 6 hour battery time which doesn't last a whole day at work so I would have to stop listening while they charged and usually they cost more than two pairs of these oh, so that's why I believe having two sets with 3 hour battery life is better than one with five or six hours worth. Like I said I listen mostly to talk radio and as for the sound quality it's great but seems a little bass-heavy heavy and the base is kind of thick rather than clear bass. But I haven't given them a chance yet really with music so I can't make a fair judgement on that. Also they do not have active noise-cancelling they act more like earplugs to handle noise. I think they did a good job of blocking noise and that regard I had them on while a saw was running and still heard clearly. So like I said I just bought a second pair and I look forward to another review after having them for a week and I can better tell how the microphone phone calls and music work out. But I can already say for sure I'm happy with this purchase and I think they're a great deal and serve my needs perfectly.",5,1,2020-7-24,1,1,0
"I’ve tried a handful is these $30-$50 Bluetooth headphones, and these are without a doubt the best. Easy set up and pair well, fast charging and a fairly long battery life. Plus, they stay put in my ears through working out and gardening! I’m fair skinned and the fleshy colored ones blend right in with my ears. I’ve now bought two pairs - one my training puppy got ahold of, and the other accidentally fell out of my sports bra in the garden (took it out to talk to neighbors, put in bra because I am a woman and I pretend I don’t sweat in between my boobs then at some point I leaned over and bloop. I searched and searched, even pumped up some heavy metal and wandered around outside in the dark with my phone connected to it thinking I might hear it. No dice.)So now I need a third. And tbh, I’ll break down and buy it, because they’re just that good. Clearly....I can’t speak to their longevity, but I say buy ‘em nonetheless.",5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"Can I give these 10 stars?I became an audiophile in the 70's when I purchased a very expensive component sound system. Since then I've had many speakers, headphones and earbuds from lots of manufactures. I ordered these on a whim after reading the reviews. When I played Al Stewarts Year of the Cat from my I Phone, I was blown away with the presence, clarity and as we used to say, the total lack of harmonic and inter-modulary distortion. I then tried one of the most beautiful and difficult pieces of music ever recorded: the London Phase 4 recording of Leopold Stokowski's Scheherazade (the Cala remastered version). Again, the clarity and silkiness of the violins, especially at the end when the concertmaster hits those incredible highs, was pure joy. I hope the manufacturer doesn't read this because they would be a bargain at many times the price.",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
Update to note the company is sending me a new unit. Will update if problems continue.My first bluetooth headset. The fit and finish is great and they're durable. The concept and pairing is simple and straight forward. Generally speaking they function as advertised at a good price.,5,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
"I’m always on the phone taking care of business during the week and am used to putting my phone on speaker, which is fine at home, but not so great when driving because I have to talk so loud for the other party to hear me; I have Bluetooth capability in my vehicle, however, I get a lot of complaints that I cut out. In public I hold the phone and this is inconvenient because it leaves me one hand to work with when shopping or writing, and I am a big multitasker. I have a Bluetooth piece and it’s just too bulky, so it’s sitting in a drawer. So, after many months of these TOZO Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds sitting on my Amazon List, I FINALLY did it; I ordered them, and WOW, I now ask myself why did I wait so long? I absolutely love them. No one has complained at all about how I sound, they actually say I sound clear, they do not hear any background noise, even when I’m driving. I like that I can use one at a time if I choose to, this way I can still have one free ear at all times, not to mention, if one needs charging, the other can be used. I love that I can keep them in the charging case and set them on a wireless charger for charging. Having them in a charging case is an added bonus as well so I don’t have to worry about losing them and it’s a pretty nice solid case. So far no complaints except that I wish I had listened to my friends and purchased these sooner.",5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"I bought these for my daughter and she wanted something with better sound quality so now they are mine. For me they work great and sound perfect to me. The battery lasts a long time too. I love that it came with several different sizes to ensure a perfect fit. These are the first earbuds I've had that aren't too big and don't hurt my ears.  These are very good earbuds for the price. If you want really amazing sound quality I would suggest one of the pricier options because it seems that you get what you pay for with earbuds. The only other thing I would like is the capability to change the sound settings, like the bass and treble, etc. With these you can only turn them on and off and turn the volume up and down. Overall, for the price these are very good headphones that are definitely worth the price.",4,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"I had bought another pair from a different manufacturer so I knew going in that these might not fit my very small ear canals. I had already planned to use them indoors while sitting and viewing media on the computer if they didn't fit. I had read another review from someone with the same problem who said these fit him. But no, they fall out within minutes for me. Tried all size buds. Eventually the bud works its way out and the top part is too heavy to stay in without that anchor. I did get the right side to stay in better by cutting one lengthwise slit in the smallest bud cover. It does not seem to affect the sound.The sound is really good. It feels immersive to me when I am watching movies or playing music. I am however, not an audiophile.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"I didn't want to spend a lot for wireless earbuds because I didn't know how I would like them.  This product had tons of great reviews and the price was right so I snapped them up, and boy am I glad I did.The sound quality is very good.  Better than most of my wired ones or my LG Tones.  Definitely better than the old standard Apple wired earbuds that came with iPhones and iPads.  The bass is heavy and the noise cancellation is pretty solid.  Not 100% like some of the pricey headsets, but again, better than most.  My step-son has Raycons that are almost 3 times the price and about the same quality.",5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"I purchased this product to replace my wireless earphone from Plantronics. I used for a while, but it really didn't fit my ear perfectly. Since it didn't fit perfectly, the sound was not good and was able to ear all noises from outside. At last, my cat chewed on the earphone and I had to say bye to my Plantronics. I searched a lot for a replacement and I decided to go with earbuds because my cat can't chew on it.This product provides better sound quality (it has enough bass if you are bass lover), good noise canceling (not like the high-end noise-canceling headphones, but it works great!), and the wireless charging case is a huge bonus.",5,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0
I didn't expect these to be life changing considering the price but I've spent $30 on better quality earbuds.Pro - the sound quality is really good. The volume is so much higher with these than other earbuds of comparable price.,3,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"I'm not a music buff, nor have I ever used ear buds of a higher quality before - so please understand my review is based mostly on listening to books while running (not music).My order arrived very timely.

"TL;DR: noise-canceling works, definitely waterproof (but don't wear them under water because bluetooth), price is a good deal (better than Air Pods), be aware that they are so small people might not realize you're wearing them and will try to talk to you, and don't wear them when you need to be audibly aware of your surroundings (walking in public, riding public transportation, driving).I bought these because of the price. I searched for the best-rated bluetooth headphones on Amazon.com and found these. I could not bring myself to pay $150 for Air Pods. I just can't. These are typical noise-canceling headphones, which I actually don't like, but they work very well. They come with different sizes of rubber earpieces, so you can find one that fits you best. I took the smallest ones and still couldn't hear anything with them in - anything besides the headphones. I was a little confused by the instructional pamphlet about how to connect the headphones, and that the Right one will connect to your device and then the Left one connects to the right one... blah blah. This is not actually how it played out in real life when I took them out of the box. No matter, as they were set up in a few minutes. I paired my phone with the Right one and then the Left one caught up. It will still show up in your list of devices, but it won't connect. Don't worry, like I did, that this means something is wrong. You can't connect to the Left one.",4,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
"REVIEW UPDATE .Spoke  too soon . After having them for almost two months , the left ear bud just completely stopped charging . Now feeling like I wasted money and am genuinely upset because I was so in love with them ....",1,1,2020-1-31,1,1,0
"I like these ear buds a lot.  I haven't had many sets, but these are way better than the very cheap, and understandably, don't sound as amazing as the really expensive brands.  However, they work fine for me.  I generally use them at work or when listening to music/pod casts.  I like that I can use just one, though if you do, you must always use the one labeled Right side.  This is not a big issue though, if I need to, I just wear it in the left ear.  The case holds 4 charges so that is nice.  My only complaints are that the blue color I ordered, isn't so much blue as a blue tinted gray.  It's still pretty and color doesn't affect function, so it's fine.  Also, I have a tendency to take it out and let it lay when someone is talking to me, so I'm forever afraid I'm going to lose one.  (I'm used to the LG neck band style).",4,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"Overall these are good headphones. When you are close to your paired device and have no obstructions between yourself and the paired device, the sound is clear and good. When you leave your paired device somewhere and start walking around, that's when issues occur.I bought them specifically for wearing while I do the dishes. I set up my tablet next to the sink and turn on Hulu while I do the dishes each night. When I'm standing at the sink, the sound is great. However, when I walk around the kitchen and put dishes away or walk to our table to pick up dishes, the sound will cut out if there are certain objects (usually metallic) that break the line of sight to the tablet. The headphones are still paired to my tablet, but the sound is lost.",4,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
"these are absolutely fantastic. I was a bit skeptic at first, buying a pair of truly wireless earbuds without a solid name brand.. boy was i wrong! the sound quality is great right off the bat, and then when making the adjustments in controls in my phone it gets better! Im a big movie watcher thru my phone during cardio sessions in the gym, i'll watch a whole movie sometimes. these work flawlessly! there is no lag either! and the sweat resistant is perfect! the case is cool too, hats how they charge, and the case even charges! so if im at the gym and the buds die, i can plug them into the case for a quick charge! The case seems well built, the magnet that keeps the top closed is strong! and the top is like a smokey clear, so you can see the LED's inside! The only downfall i guess is that you rely on the case to charge the buds, so maybe consider getting second case. These also come with a great 1 year warranty! WOW! simply awesome.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,1
"I understand the physics behind this. The right earbud connects to the device, and the left earbud connects to the right. But Bluetooth uses 2.4 GHz, which does not transmit through water. What is my head made of? Mostly water. So turning my head, or moving, or really much of anything, causes the left bud to drop out. Constantly. Plenty of other manufacturers have figured this out, but not this one.Audio sounds fine, build quality seems good, and I really like that the case is water resistant. But none of it matters when the left audio channel constantly cuts out.",5,1,2019-7-4,1,0,0
"Upon initially opening the product, I was really impressed with the quality of these ear buds. The case feels sturdy, as do the ear buds, and they were so simple to set up! The sound quality's great! As someone who listens to wildly varying music, it was nice to put my music on shuffle and remain pleased with the sound. I've tried bluetooth headphones in the past, and they always seemed to really lack in the bass department, or sounded like you were in an empty room listening to your neighbors play music. Not these! The sound quality has really exceeded my expectations. Every song that played sounded crisp. Even bass heavy songs sounded bomb! Another perk to these is the volume of the ear buds. Is your hearing a little worse for wear from years of listening to music on the highest volume possible in your headphones? These things have got you covered. The sound quality is great for the price, and not to mention the ear buds have a snug fit, that prevents them from slipping. Overall, these little buds are pretty stellar, and I'd highly recommend them!",5,1,2020-6-26,1,1,0
"These little headphones are MONSTERS. I've had them for roughly six months now. The battery life is amazing. I charge them maybe every other week and use them every day for at least 1-2 hours.

I bought these to replace a halfway decent bluetooth headset I used for running that crapped out on me after a solid 18 months of use.  I am pretty sweaty so I figured I'd give the wireless earbud style a shot and see what it was like given the IPX8 waterproofing certification.  The price is... compelling.  50 USD for a pair of wireless earbuds is hard to ignore.So... how are they?  Decent.,3,1,2019-7-27,1,0,0
"I think  Apple airbuds are overpriced, but bought some BF airbuds for my daughter for Christmas.  Got looking around a at the other true wireless bluetooth earbuds and decided to try these based on reviews on the web and the price.Definitely louder than the airbuds and better noise isolation.  Fullness sometimes would soften on me, then I looked closer at the instructions to rotate them slightly to better keep them firm in my ear.  Can't complain on the sound now at all.  Pretty good low and high range.",5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"I have went through several different brands searching for a set that is affordable and it works. My friend had a set of these for awhile, so I was hopeful. I bought these for work and only use them during downtime. I need to option to be able to take my earbud quickly when we get busy and put it on my desk so, I can come back to it later. I should have known this product was defective when I got them and the charging case was the only pair I have ever had that was always dead. Today I plugged them in to charge and the lights would not come on or anything. After trying several different cord or outlets in my home and getting no where I asked for my husband’s help. He plugged them in his computer and one of them blinked. I charged them for one hour and noticed when I grabbed them they were hot. Thinking it was just them being charged for two long I put one in (which was a dumb idea). It burnt the inside of my ear because the plastic around where the charging case connected to the ear bud was meltedand caused the ear bud to also melted. I do not have a burn from this because of burn cream but it still hurt. Products do have defects and that’s fine. To not have a default longer return/replacement on these is just bad business. I hope this company goes on a does better than this, but they will do so without my support. Some of need music to get through the day right now and it sucks that this happened.",1,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
Update- The company offered to send me a new set and they sent the T6 version this time. This set had a unique earpiece that fits much better than the T10. I use them every day at work!

I am an iPhone user so at first i considered AirPods - but who wants to spend close to $200 for earbuds that aren’t even noise cancelling?Anyways, I found these based on the good reviews and decided to try them. I am very impressed and would recommend these to anyone. They are truly noise cancelling and waterproof. they synced up to my phone so quick.

"These headphones are great in concept.  They are completely wireless, pairing to each other and the device.  They have a storage container that serves as storage and the charging station (and has a small internal battery so you can charge the headphones while away from home) which is handy and eliminates the need to charge them independently or with a cord.  They have a pretty good range and sound quality.However, about a week after receiving my headphones the left one stopped working.  I'm not sure if the charging stopped or if there was some other issue.  It won't charge in either the right or left slot of the docking station so it's definitely the headphone itself that is defective.  I still use the right headphone when I'm working out or on my commute, but given the price I would definitely look for another product.",2,1,2019-2-26,1,2,0
"I've just received these and after a charge, the sound quality is great when listening to music from my phone. The bass quality is really good. They charged and paired quickly and easily.  I have to admit, I was disappointed that there were no instructions in the manual about how to increase/decrease volume from the buds themselves. Im still working it out, but if you hold the right side button down for less time than the power (a couple seconds) it will increase the vokume. Likewise, on the left side should decrease the volume. I think pushing the button once will pause the music. I don't think there's a way to skip or reverse songs. I haven't been able to test the phone speaker quality.

"My T10 earbuds arrived today - relatively quickly despite the pandemic. So thank you Tozo! I was worried about the fit - They fit perfectly using the smallest sized ear caps, and they fit securely in my ear. And now for the sound. I purchased Apple wireless earbuds for my mother for her 82nd birthday. She loves them. After trying out both the Apple and Tozo pairs of earbuds, I could not hear any difference. It’s a great feeling when I factor in the Apple price tag. Also, I never liked the  look of the Apple earbuds - they look a little silly to me. I love the look and feel of the Tozo earbuds - the rose gold tone blends in well and does not call attention to itself.The Tozo earbuds arrived nearly fully charged, and only took 10 minutes more to reach a full charge in the Charging Case. They paired like magic with my iPhone, and the signal remained strong 30 feet away! After I have them a month or more I’ll come back and update this  review. Finally, I am delighted the T10 earbuds come with the 1.5 year warranty - this was a nice surprise.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"I just received these yesterday. The sound quality is excellent as well as the ease of use. They pair right away and it is very easy to control your phone, Ereader etc. when using them. I did try to use one instead of both but when i put the left earbud back in the case, it would always disconnect? I am not sure if i am doing something wrong or not? I also could not turn down the volume by the earbuds. Again not sure if i am just not understanding how to properly use them. I love how they also will charge wirelessly. That is a super plus. All in all these are great earbuds. I also liked how they come with extra sized ear pieces. I needed the small and they worked great. I have not tried exercising in them yet so not sure how well they stay in? Will update after using them a while. I would highly recommend these. So far they have exceeded my expectations and i am very pleased with them. They actually sound better than using my iPhone to talk through. Very happy so far.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0

"I was skeptical about this product, but it has exceeded my expectations in every way. Sound quality is marvelous but they must be positioned properly in the ear to get the best quality, particularly in the bass. You can charge the case while listeneing to the earbuds, then put them in the case where they will be charged. I've not tryed the charging pad (purchasing one today). The important thing to remember is to use the earcaps which fit and place them in your ear solidly and carefully using a twist. I had problems with one falling out until I got this down. No problem now. One of the most satisfying experiences I've had with electronics such as this.OK...6 months of hard use and I'm still highly impressed. The only flaw is in the fact that it is possible for the earbud to come out and since there is no wire connecting the two, it fall to whatever lies below. I purchased memory foam eartips which make the fit much more secure but I still occasionally have one drop out. The flip side of this weakness is no wire to get tangled or caught on surrounding objects.",5,1,2019-6-1,1,0,0
Well pretty disappointed in these earphones. The sound quality is great they have some amazing bass for how small they are but they are so awkward on the head when you wear them. The instructions tells you to wear them one way and when I do that they look absolutely ridiculous on me so I splin them upside down so they don't stick out as far but they still stick out pretty far. Just know they will stick out a good bit from your ears. I didn't realize they would do this or I would spent more money and got a better and smaller pair. I haven't fully tested the battery but I fully charged it last night and just today the few times I've used it the indicator on the case says there's no charge left. Lol my biggest complaint about these things which really I can't complain because I didn't read to know this wasn't on these but the button on the earphones only pauses and plays your music. You can't skip forward or back to a different song from the headphones themselves. You have to use your phone which I think is so stupid. And these things have over 40k reviews on here? That blows me away... Definitely won't buy another pair of these. The sound good but other then then that they don't have much going for them. I'd recommend getting a different brand that is smaller and bits better to the ear and has the option to change the music from the earphones themselves.,3,1,2020-3-16,1,0,0
"First off I have to say I own a pair of Bose earbuds that I paid $300 for. That being said I WISH i would have found these first. Now I’m only gonna talk about the sound quality considering I’ve owned them for about 2 hours. First off when I first turned them on I was blown away, volume only half way up and was loud (good loud), so going loud enough is not a worry. Next I tried about 10 different kinds of songs and all sounded amazing! Crisp clear highs, bass was great and mids were on point. That being said, if I would have paid $100 I’d still be overly joyed! If you buy these you won’t be disappointed.... p.s ANYONE that are having battery issues got a defective pair (which happens with electronics, believe me I fix them for a living). They should return them for a different set, cause mine are absolutely amazing.",5,1,2019-4-3,1,1,0
"Innitial impressions were pretty good. Nice premium feeling carrying/charging case, high quality audio output, relatively premium looking earpieces themselves, nice waterproof capabilities. However, after a day of heavy usage ive noticed a few major flaws in these earbuds.Subpar battery life. This things battery lasts about 2 to 3 hours before needing to be charged again, which isnt great but isnt horrible either. However, this problem is compounded by the fact that only the right earbud can be used by itself, so once the right earbud dies, your stuck not being able to listen to music for about 30 minutes until it finishes charging. An issue that could have easily been avoided by simply making both earbuds able to be directly connected to your phone via bluetooth.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,1,0
"I purchased these three earbuds and compared them. TOZO (ranked #5 in “Earbuds), 4.4 stars from 8300 reviews, took 1st place with ease. The sound..AMAZING. Deep rich base and clear highs. All pair very easily with my iPhone X and functions are all fine. Sound is where OTOZO steals the show. The other two couldn’t compare, not even close and most surprising...look at the comaparison.",5,1,2019-8-16,1,0,0
"( Revised after multiple attempts by company to bribe me by revising my review.)Actual product appears quite good. Sound cancellation works great. Comes with a good variety of earpieces. Why the low rating? They offer a ‘free’ gift and extended warrenty in return for a 5 star rating.  My rule is I don’t sell my rating.  I give an honest evaluation so others benefit from my experience. Any company that try’s to buy a good eval from purchasers doesn’t believe their product can stand on its own merits. Oh and they make it a point to say ‘ don’t mention the ‘free gift’ in the evaluation. Make of that what you will.Revised after several attempts by company to convince me to change my review thru bribery.

"I originally thought this product was fantastic - a cordless set of ear buds you can use in the shower/pool?? HOWEVER, within a month or so of using the ear buds, the left bud has totally died on me - I can't turn it on, charge it, anything!I received a second set of ear buds from Tozo, and the SAME EXACT THING happened after a few uses - the left ear bud is now completely useless!",1,1,2019-6-27,1,2,0
"I really liked the idea of a base that will keep you charged on the go.  Well, either the headphones constantly draw energy, or the base itself loses its charge.  Bought these to take on a summer trip. I would use one at a time for a couple of hours a day or so. You can pair either unit to phone, which is great.  After using each unit for maybe 3hrs(?) the base would be dead.  So I tried just fully charging the base and not using them headphones for a few days.  The base battery was dead by day 4. The individual earbuds only turn on when you pull them from the base, so they shouldn't need constant charging.  Over all the sound is good. Had I not been out of town for 5 weeks, I might have tried to return/exchange to find out if it was only my unit that did this.",3,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0

"I run a business in which I work hard, fast, and needed a way to use music to zone while moving a lot with yanking a cord every two minutes. I was worried about the more expensive wireless earbuds in case my level of activity would be too much for that expense. These proved to be perfect. The sound is great, however slightly lacking in migrating mid-to-high levels (minor detail, not a deal-breaker at all). The bass is perfect for a d&b-head like me, and they stay put. They come with 4 different sized pairs of earbud attachments and I found my ears are happy with the second-to-smallest (I'm female). I have tried them in the shower and it was fine until I started to shampoo and the soap dripped to lubricate the set and they started to slip a little but didn't fall out; not a product problem - function and reliability were not at all affected.It's important to find the correct-sized earbud adapter (included) and install them correctly - get the ends moist to help slide them on. Install into the ears correctly, too: Put them in with the base pointed down and out toward your face, then twist them up and back so the base now fits into your ear flange and pointed back and up. That'll seal the earbud into your ear.",5,1,2019-2-23,1,0,0
"I have always had ""wireless"" earbuds that run out of juice before I finish my workout. These are different. After finding the right size cushion, these earbuds are comfy and block out all noise. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't talk to the quality of sound, but I think my music sounds fantastic. I didn't think the waterproof option would be helpful, but I wear them in the shower all the time now. Caution - spontaneous dancing in the shower is possible! Charging - I probably charge these every few days. Amazing how long they hold a charge. I usually wear them for a few hours at a time. The longest was 4 hours, and they still had lots of life. My left earbud stopped working after two months, and I went to the TOZO website for help. They instantly sent me a message and worked with me to try to fix the issue. When nothing helped, they immediately replaced my earbud. Great customer service! I highly recommend it.",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"Lets start off with the good, these headphones sound great, probably one of the best sounding headphones I've tried. Deep strong bass even at low volumes without distortion. Unfortunately, these headphones are the most annoying pair with stupid little annoying features built right in. The bluetooth connection sucks, it takes a while before it connects auto, than when it does, it talks to much, ""right channel connected, left channel connected, connected"" if you press play on your song before its done saying all that it'll fail the connection completely. You can only use the right headphone by itself if you want, but if you do, the right will constantly chirp/beep, every few seconds no matter what, even if you have a song on or you're on the phone. The programming on it sucks so bad, there's even times when they won't disconnect from my phone even after I put both headphones in their case/charger. These would've been awesome headphones but those mistakes are so annoying, I've had them for a few days and I have to return them because they'll raise your blood pressure, so my recommendation is to AVOID these headphones!!!",2,1,2019-8-15,1,1,0
"This is a fantastic product! I was looking for an ""in-ear' headphone alternative to replace MY customary ""over the ear"" headphones because I wanted something compact. But truth be told I wasn't a fan of anything that went inside the ear because I had found they always fell out! Well I did my YouTube and Amazon review research and I narrowed it down to the Tozo T10. I am a proud Android phone user (Samsung Note 9) and I didn't want anything that looked like those long white stemmed eye sores, so aesthetically, for me, they were perfect! It turns out that they fit beautifully, they sound AMAZING, the battery life is superb and I could not be more satisfied over a purchase as this! I would recommend these headphones to everyone and anyone! Oh by the way, pairing Bluetooth devices for me is very often hit or miss for me but these pods came about 75% charged out of the box and I'VE NEVER seen a faster pairing out of the box!! I literally took one pod out of the case and before I could pull the other one out, within seconds the pod had already paired! It was amazing! And lastly, the price was economical for an item of this quality! Perfection is hard to come by, so if I have one complaint is that replacing the the rubber tips for a better fit, at least for me, was a difficult task! I don't know if I was creating a more complicated scenario but I found that part to be annoying, but I finally accomplished my mission and if that's the worst I can mention, what are you still doing reading this review!? Go put in your order, I think you will be pleasantly pleased, I know was!",5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
"I'm a big fan of these earbuds.  The Apple earbuds don't stay in my ears plus they are expensive.  These stay in my ears and are comfortable to wear.  They come with 4 different sizes of rubber caps so there should be a size for everyone.  I use mine to listen to music and watch videos and the sound is very good.  I'm sure there are better sounding earbuds out there, but for the price these are hard to beat.  I saw a lot of reviews saying that you can't use these 1 at a time so let me be clear that you absolutely can.  If I use one long enough to run the battery down I put it back in the case and get the other one out.  While I'm listening using the second earbud the first one is charging in the case.  You could use them all day like this.There are a couple of things that I don't like about them but they aren't big enough problems to take away a star.  Both of them are due to bulk.  Each earbud sticks out of your ear so they're not very comfortable to wear laying on your side.  I don't do that much so it's not a big problem for me.  The other bulky issue is the case.  If you're familiar with the case that comes with the Apple earbuds this one is about twice the size.  Again, not a huge issue for me but if you plan on putting it in your pocket it's fairly big.  It's about 3.25 inches long & 1.25 inches wide & 1.25 inches tall.",5,1,2019-4-18,1,1,0
"These ear buds are great! I've always had problems with my ear buds til I found these. The sound is amazing. My voice is clear as a bell on the other end of a phone call. I use it mainly for phone calls, so I can be hands free. The wireless charging option is awesome too! I definitely recommend these Tozo ear buds. The battery life is way better than any buds I've had also. I talked to my dad for a hours, played a few games, watched a show, and listened to about an he of music. It never told me the battery was low and it never cut out. The range on this baby isn't bad either. I left my phone on the back porch, went all the way to the front of my house to my room, closing all doors behind me. The Bluetooth didn't cut out til I got to the furthest corner of my room. But it never disconnected from my phone. Just the music cut out for a sec til I got back within range. But these earbuds.. Awesome product for a very affordable price. I am for sure a happy happy customer!!!!!!!",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,1
"I really like the headphones.  They sound good and fit my ears well. The only negative for me is the poor outgoing audio for phone calls.  My friend said the earbud's mic made my voice fuzzy/cloudy/veiled.  Since using these for phone calls is a low priority for me, I only dock the rating by one star.  On the plus side, dictation via Siri worked fine.While reading reviews I noticed some misinformation, so here's some info from the product manual.",4,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0

Both offered me a replacement or a gift card, but Jamie added “If you don't want to delete the review, I hope you can change the review to 4 or 5 stars, because it is relevant to my performance.

"Not bad for the price. Audiophile here... I'm just gonna cut to the chase based on sound mainly for those of you looking for sound quality feedback. I'm always looking for the best sound, and for this price, this is not bad... Using it mainly from my phone for music, BUT you do need an equalizer app (recommended) to get the most out of these earbuds or your sh*t will sound flat and bass is way to high. Up the treble a lot more so it's nice and crisp/clean, and lower the bass just a tad and this thing will be pretty damn good sounding. It's also loud enough too. Without equalizer app to help adjust: 3/5 and with equalizer app: 4/5Reason for 4 score is I shouldn't have to adjust if it's that awesome right out the box. Of course for the price is understandable. And I'm happy enough for true wireless convenience and earphone material/charging box seems of good quality. Plus I'm cheap, when it comes to brands I don't know yet... But 19K+ 4+star reviews, I gave it a shot! So far so good. I would recommend it as long as you have equalizer to adjust band frequencies.

"The earbuds case is solid with a translucent hinged top so you can see the charging status lights. They turn on and off easily by removing and returning them to the case and there's a solid click when you return them to the case. The best feature is that they can be recharged wirelessly. I've successfully charged them wirelessly on both my round 'hot plate' and vertical 'easel' style chargers. There's a wired USB micro charging port as well.The 8mm driver provides very good sound for the price. I'm sure everyone knows the sound quality is dependent on the fit and experimenting with the supplied ear covers is critical; there are several and I easily found the right ones for my ear size. I found them comfortable too. The bass is subtle but overall, the sound is acceptable. I haven't tried using them for phone calls.",5,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
"Overall its a great product at a great price. Great sounds quality, fit well an has multiple sizes of buds so you can pick whats right for you. However, after awhile there are a few things i havnt been totally thrilled with. Mainly the charging case. I noticed that the battery indicator lights on the case stay on all the time, even if the earbuds are fully charged, which didn't seem like a big deal until they sat for a few days. I realized that the lights are slowly draining the case battery when you let it sit off the charger. Its not good to always have it on a charger since it can weaken the battery overtime, so its a bit of a design flaw but dosn't make the product unusable either. Also, the inability of turning the volume up an down from the earbuds can be a slightly inconvenient, however, the newer T6 model does allow it along with multiple other functions, so will likely upgrade to them. Overall, its a nice product an it seems that most of the flaws have been addressed in their newer model, so would suggest buying the T6 rather than this one.",4,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
"I have a serious hearing issue and have problems with even the more expensive headphones. I decided to take a risk on these and came away with a pleasant surprise. Volume is no problem for me. I can hear the media, but  understanding it is something else. Something about these earbuds just seems to resonate with me. I haven't had them for long, so I don't know what the long term will bring, but being able to enjoy a night of music was a pure pleasure. They paired up easily then paired right to my phone and my pc with no problem. I even watched (and understood) a movie on Netflix,Yes, I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for some decent headphones at a good price.",5,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
Just a warning...after a month earbuds will not sync with each other at all.  Little over a month after purchase the earbuds pair separately to my phone and will not sync together no matter what I tried.

"After using these for 3 months solid, I would have gone with a different product. They seem to cut out alot which is very annoying. They sound choppy and dont seem to have a strong signal to my devices, and sometimes they dont cut out together or at the same timming.

"First, I am not a big fan of earbuds in general. I like that they are compact and don't mess up my hair but they are generally very uncomfortable for me to wear for any extended period. These don't bother me at all. I swapped the earpieces for one size smaller (the box includes 3 extra sizes) and the earpieces are soft and flexible.I have been using these for a couple weeks to listen to audiobooks on walks or jogs in the park that generally last 30-45 minutes.

"The packaging is well done with QuickStart instructions right on top as you open it up. Paired to my Asus desktop immediately as well as my Samsung Galaxy S8. The 4 different sizes of ear bud caps should accommodate most ears. They have already provided 3+ hours of audio from streamed sources with the charge they arrived with. The build quality of both the ear buds and their charge case is well worth the price. Some of the “English” in the instructions is a bit odd but was able to make sense of most of it. I paid around $34 with a coupon I wasn’t aware was available until checkout. If you are looking for a budget set of ear buds I would recommend these. Hopefully they hold up in other ways like wearing during yard work, will know soon. These are not noise canceling as far as I can tell.",4,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"This is a good product... for the price. The sound is way better than expected although I wish the battery life was a bit longer.For me, the earbuds last roughly two hours before needing to be recharged.

So I decided to finally try truly wireless headphones because my over the ear headphones sound great but I sweat too much with them on in the summer time.  I had a difficult time deciding which ones to buy because there were so many choices.  I'm glad I bought these.  They seem to be of good quality.  After finding the right size ear tip for me Ive decided they sound really good.  They have great full range sound with punchy bass.  I mainly listen to bands like Radiohead and Grouplove and in my opinion these are perfect for that type of music.  I plan on mainly using these for when I'm either at my home relaxing or walking around town and these seem like they will work great for that.  I'm very happy with this product.,5,1,2019-6-13,1,1,0
"After my wife forgot to complete her AirPods Pro purchase on another website she noticed these on Amazon. After some consideration and deep conversation on what else she could buy with the extra money she decided to try these out. The noise canceling is perfect because I didn’t have to listen to her Mom song play list. I was able to ask her about spending money on fireworks and she didn’t say no, maybe it was because she couldn’t hear me over the amazing sound quality these provide. I had to buy her a house with a pool so she could test the waterproof feature so I will post an update when she jumps in for the first time. They paired easily with her iPhone, it was completed in a few easy steps. I would recommend these to anyone wanting a quality product that will not break the bank, unless you have to buy a house with a pool so she can test the waterproof feature.",5,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"I’ve used them once on a windy, 25 mile woods/road bike ride. The sound was excellent and noise cancellation is very good. Touch features are great as I have this connected to my IPod not my phone so I don’t have a need to take phone calls. The only issue I’ve been having is the connection. Almost the entire ride the buds kept cutting out. Now my iPod was a foot and half behind me in my bag so distance wise that was not the issue. I messed around with them in several stops but it kept doing once I turned them on again. This is frustrating because you want consistent music with no cut outs or interruptions. Not sure if I just have a dud or this is what to expect with something a little cheaper then the big names.Update: 05/8/19",5,1,2019-4-29,1,0,0
I have always had issues with the type of headphones that sit inside the ears (ranging from back in the day Skullcandy ones to current Anker ones I tried out last year). I was hesitant to give it a go again but decided to try it since there were so many reviews that these were THE ONE that would finally fit and stay in place. Unfortunately for me this was not the case and I'm very disappointed that my ears and these headphones could not agree with one another.  They did not fit in my ears at all and jut out uncomfortably. I have to jam them into my ears to get a good fit but with the slightest movement of my head or jaw they would pop out. I tried with all of the different ear bud sizes that came with the box and they all did the same thing.I do not recommend anyone that has had issues with this style of ear buds to purchase these headphones because you will likely run into the same problem like me and just be disappointed and frustrated.,2,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
So my first experience with these headphones were just awful. So sent them back and I was just pretty much done with getting a pair.Well the company contacted me.... we emailed back and forth and I agreed to try them out again. Was it possible I got a defective pair?,5,1,2020-3-17,1,0,1
"I bought these as a surprise for my husband who is constantly fighting tangled wires with his headphones. I had absolutely no idea what I was buying, I was just looking for something not crazy expensive with decent reviews. He LOVED them! These are things he keeps raving about: They are comfortable, stay in when he is mowing the grass or exercising and he was especially impressed that he doesn't have to have his phone on him. They work a decent distance away from his phone. He also paired them to his computer and the firestick. The charge lasts a long time, the charging/storage case is really nice. They seem really durable. They are waterproof!! I'm actually kind of tired of hearing about how great these are, but I might buy a pair for my dad and brother now too since he likes them so much. Seems like a solid gift idea.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"There's a reason why more than 83% of the 7,000+ people who reviewed this gave it 4 or 5 stars. For ear buds, the bass is incredible. You may have to try all the different sizes they provide to get the right fit. If you don't, they may fall out or you may not hear the excellent range very well. Love that these and the case are IPX8. Also love that the case can wirelessly charge on a qi pad. Call quality is also excellent. I returned a $200 pair of headphones due to how well these work and sound. I guess the only downside is not being able to rewind or skip tracks. Definitely not a deal breaker for me.Update - 12/29/19",5,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0

"Connects within seconds to my, iPad, Samsung galaxy s8, LG stylo, and any other Bluetooth product I own! I changed out the ear bud tips to accommodate my preference.  The original tips match the earbud. The ear bud color I have is called khaki, it  is close to my skin tone which I love because they are not so noticeable. The sound is top notch, I have a sound engineering background so quality sound is important to me and these rank high for the price. You always lose quality sound  with wireless - but I have no complaints. They are a bit bigger than I would have hoped, I have really small ears, but overall, with the right tip I have no discomfort from the size or weight of the bud.

There were TONS of solid reviews for the Tozo T10s and so far, I get it. The sound quality is amazing and they fit in my ears without any issues.

I also find Apple earbuds to be incredibly uncomfortable and the price, therefore, ridiculous.My brother and son both have the most up-to-date Apple wireless EarPods. While they are the “in” thing and the design a bit more pleasing to the eye, I think the sound quality kind of sucks because they don’t fit into my ears comfortably. Therefore, I never get clear sound or noise cancellation. I also can never get enough sound because of the fit. If I’m going to pay upwards of $250 for earbuds of ANY kind, that sound better be crisp, clear, loud enough, and the bass pounding to my liking. 😏",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,1
"I was looking for a pair of earbuds I could use whilst working out. I won a number of ""high end"" headphones such as Shure, Sony, Bose, etc but wanted a fully wireless pair that sounded decent. I tried a number of wireless earbuds from BestBuy such as Sony, Sennheiser, Beats, etc, but wasn't impressed at all with their sound quality. I came across these on Amazon, but was skeptical as the price seemed quite low for what the manufacturer claimed they could do and how they sounded. I decided to give them a try as Amazon have an excellent returns policy.I am very glad I got these. They sound amazing. Much better than the much more expensive ones I tried from Best Buy. I also thought the features, look, feel and quality of both the earbuds and the chargeable carrying case are excellent. They were extremely easy to pair with both my phone and my laptop. They fit snugly and securely in my ear, and are very easy to insert and take out.

When watching a movie on my phone,  the sound quality is great!  Most earbuds you have to turn your phone all the way up to hear but with these you don't!

I also tried using an arm band that I put on my right arm when working out and it is totally fine with never skipping.If I leave it not on my person and am doing a workout it completely disconnects if I am about 10+ feet away. I don't see how you could possibly swim laps with this unless you are in a tiny pool or have the phone attached to you when swimming? The sound quality is decent. It definitely is loud enough, I usually go to 90% of volume on headphones when working out and only have to go to 60-70% with these, and the noise canceling is good, but the treble is a little high. It stays in the ear well no matter how hard I shake my head, very very secure fit. It is very easy to pair.  You can’t adjust the volume without using your phone. I am satisfied given the price, it gets the job done that I need for wireless headphones for working out.",3,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
"After a few months of use, battery life has dramatically decreased up to the point where I need to recharge them every night after using them for only 30-45 minutes a day.People complain all the time they can barely hear me.",3,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"Clearly Apple knock-offs, these ear buds work as well as anything I've ever used.  The sound quality is what you'd expect for small earbuds like this - great for podcasts and horrible for audiophiles listening to music.My only complaint is battery life.  They won't last you all day on the phone or listening to music, but that's really to be expected considering the size.  But when I'm not using them, they're in the case recharging so it's not really nagging me to recharge all the time.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Just received these T10 earbuds.  I followed the directions to give them a quick charge before pairing and using.  The charging lights went out within about 10 min, indicating full charge; so they shipped with a decent charge.The pairing went without incident to my LG G6.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"I chose these earbuds because of the solid reviews and low cost, just hoping for an adequate listening experience while I'm riding. Admittedly it is a bit of a trick to get a full-face helmet over them (use a skull cap and some finesse), but once that's done, they're fantastic. They keep a lot of the noise out while providing a robust sound. I haven't owned a lot of in-ear devices, but of the five or so that I've used, these have the best bass while maintaining strong clarity.The only downside is the battery life, which is shorter than a lot of other options out there. I found that if I brought the case/charger with me, I could keep them going most of the time I was on the road, but I bought a second set for the longer journeys.",5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"I personaly would not attempt to jog, or do any other type of active sport, while attempting to wear these in my ears, because I literally have to lick the nasty, ear waxed flavored ear buds, each and every time that I try to screw them deep enough into both sides of my scull, so that I am able to receive the best sound quality, which I must say, 'sound great'!For some reason, none of the included three sizes of soft tips are the correct fit for me, however, these are much better quality than the last pair that I had purchased and had to return,because they came from a third ""party seller"", and they were not even good enough quality to sell at the dollar store. ALWAYS take your time to read the one star reviews 1st, before purchasing any item on Amazon.",4,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"It's official - I, a person who had a hard time giving up my wired, over-the-head headphones, am 100% converted to these wireless earbuds!! Comfortable, SO easy to activate and use, and GREAT sound quality! I tried a different brand awhile ago and always had trouble getting both the left and the right to pair -- not an issue at ALL with these ones! Paired so fast and with no difficulties at all. I have also had trouble with range in other pairs - not these! I can easily leave my phone on one side of the house and walk to the other without disconnecting or missing a beat. The only con I have so far is really just user error! The control buttons are sensitive and I have not mastered them yet. But, fortunately, they will tell me what I did so that I am atleast aware of it (example: audio paused and voice said ""Reversed"")! 100% recommend!",5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0

"Don't expect features from +100$ earbuds but these really hold there own. Quickly connects through standard bluetooth and sound very good. Battery life and portability are major features especially at 40$. I've only ran the primary right earbud down once or twice but my typical routine has them on/off the charge base all day long while working without issue! must have for the office and great for an entry set. These are not the set you'd buy if you're rationalizing 150-250$ earbuds but are exactly for you if you can't understand why someone would pay 150-250$!I had a minor issue with one earbud and the customer support worked with me to replace it. Just work directly with TOZO support since Amazon support sent me a USED replacement set, made me question the set I received from amazon the first time. Excellent support personnel and while located in china, are quick to respond during their day time hours.",5,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
"I just got these the other day, and so far so good. I had a pair of bluetooth headphones with a wire connecting them for a couple years, and the wire was starting to bug me as I ran. Additionally, now with social distancing, an over-the-ear thing on headphones has prevented me from being able to easily take off and put on my face mask when people come within 6 ft.These are a great solution. They seem to be well made, and work great. The sound quality is awesome, much better than my old ones. I haven't been able to determine the charging yet, as I just keep the case plugged in all the time since I'm not leaving the house much. They cut out a bit when I went into the house from my backyard to grab something, but that's a pretty long distance and they didn't cut out completely!",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"Update:I got this earbuds back in July (it is now November) and the left one broke, it stopped charging and I couldn’t make it work BUT I’m still keeping a 5 star rating because TOZO customer service was amazing helping me take care of this. They briefly recommended few things to see if we could fix it (nothing worked) and then they kindly agree to send another left earbud, I sincerely thank them for such prompt replies and solution!",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,1
"I've had these ear buds for about 3 weeks now. I have used several different brands of earbuds over the years and most of them end up in my drawer to collect dust after a few uses. Not with these ones. The portable, waterproof charging case makes it a breeze to take these with you anywhere and make sure they are always full of battery life. With one charge of the case, you can get at least two full charges on the earbuds. The earbuds have a battery life of about 8 hours, and if youre like me, I like to only use one at a time when Im working. The sound quality is incredible for what you pay, these actually have deeper and more rich bass than some $80 headphones Ive bought before! The mids are okay, and the highs fall a little short. But this is easily fixed with any kind of equalizer software you have on your phone or PC. The microphone picks up voice fairly well, Ive had people tell me there is some slight feedback they can hear but nothing unbearable. Ive worn these in the shower twice, and they work perfect during and after!Now the cons. Honestly the only negative thing I can say about these is that connecting to a Windows 10 pc can be tricky. So I am a gamer, and sometimes I like to just use my earbuds for music/voice chat, instead of my full headset. When pairing, you HAVE to pair to the TOZO Right channel, its the main one. For whatever reason it does not allow me to use both of them, they both wont connect and sync up. Ive tried updating drivers, checking audio/bluetooth settings, etc. Ive hard reset the earbuds which involves holding the power button on them both for 10 seconds till the lights turn purple. But this hasnt fixed it either. I can not use both earbuds on my PC. Only one. This is the only reason for 4 stars.",4,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"These are very high quality ear buds for the best price. I was looking for ear buds to replace my bulky wireless headset for working out and running and decided to purchase these after a little searching and reading reviews.  These exceeded my expectations right out of the box and will probably replace my headphones full time.  They are comfortable, sound amazing, don't fall out, and the compact case makes it easy to take them everywhere without taking up space.  Only thing I cannot comment on is the long term wear,  but after a good look over they seem to be very well constructed.  Highly recommend.EDIT: so I had an issue where the right one stopped working after water exposure. Not being submerged, just splashing water on head and face while wading in my pool. Tried to dry out and everything and no luck.  Customer service was understanding that it must be just a bad seal and instantly shipped me a replacement. Great to deal with. Still worth the 5 stats.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"These are solid little wireless buds.  The sound quality is better than expected at this price.  Wireless charging for the case is a nice bonus.  Again, not a standard feature for this price-point.  They are bit bulkier and sit weirdly in my ears, but they seem to be a very similar design/shape as 80% of the other buds available right now.My only real issue with these is the volume.  When connected to my iPhone X or iPad Air 2, the volume is CRAZY LOUD.  Even at the lowest volume setting on my phone, the music is louder than I would normally use.",5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"You have to fiddle a bit to find the best fit for the ear bud to keep the water out -so not exactly like regular earbuds. That said, these are the best thing I have added to my morning workout routine at the club. Great sound quality and connection to my phone while walking a 25 meter pool. I wear glasses all the time and they do not distort the shape of my ear to set my glasses wonky, nor are they pushed out of my ear when I move my glasses. The connecting and syncing is a little finicky when you're dealing with multiple items they can sync to (fitbit Versa and Android phone for instance), but once connected I'm good for an hour or more without interruptions.True to technology, bluetooth does not travel through water, so the sound will cut out while swimming with your head in the water and occassionally while in the shower.",5,1,2019-1-24,1,1,0
"I've had these for 5 months and I can say they are very well constructed and of good quality. The reason I gave these 4.5 stars is that I do wish they came with either ear hooks or ear wings as I am having to readjust them at the gym from time to time. As most earbuds of this type, they stay on due to a vacuum caused by the silicone ear tips.This same vacuum is the sole cause for the noise cancellation, as most of the sound is blocked off from entering your ears. This means that you are not able to have a conversation with both buds in. The sound is decent, not comparable with Jabras or anything in the above $100 range, but if you are paying $50 for these then you should only expect decent sound. I use them mostly for podcasts and music streaming in the gym and they are fine.",4,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
"overall these are a great pair of headphones, they are light and stay in the ear well. The battery life is pretty good but not amazing. Sound quality is crisp and clear, and they do a reasonable job of acting as hearing protection when mowing or working with power tools. There are a few negatives however:1) range and interference - These are setup so that the right ear is the ""master"" unit that communicates with the phone. I find that if my phone is in my left front pocket the headphones will occasionally cut out especially when moving around. This goes away when phone is moved to right pocket, but its something to be aware of.",4,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"I was super excited to find earbuds that seemed to fit for small ears with great sound / noise cancellation.Even with the smallest add-on, these dont fit well (for me).

I own another brand I paid over $350 for and this set of Tozo T10 earbuds is proof positive that the amount paid has nothing to do with performance.I will certainly buy additional sets for gifts to friends and family.",5,1,2019-10-16,1,0,1
"I was a little annoyed with some pairing issues. I have others that turn on and pair automatically when removed from case, and turn off automatically as soon as you put them back in. These seemed like they did the opposite. I'd have to manually turn them on when I take them out, but often when they were in the case they would be on and paired. So I'd be wondering why my phone audio wasn't working, only to find it's playing through the ear buds that are in the case charging.That was an annoyance but they otherwise performed well, until a few days ago when one  of them just refused to power on. Charged the case, put bud in to charge, no response. Hold down the button to turn on, nothing. Just dead after 4 months of normal use.",1,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"At first I thought these headphones would be the perfect fit for my needs. But It was really challenging to so I connect these headphones to my phone. When I thought that I mastered a specific procedure to connect the headphones to my phone, it just didn’t work. This product is definitely flawed, with some updates, I think that they may be pretty good for the price. I would suggest that if you don’t want to waste your money, don’t buy these headphones until a newer version comes out. It’s just not worth the frustration!",1,1,2020-5-1,1,1,0

"First off, let me say that I was tricked into making a review for this product.I bought this after checking all of the many reviews on Amazon saying that this was a great product. There were a ton of favorable reviews. After receiving the product, I opened it up and saw that there was a 1-year warranty that you need to activate. Upon activating, I received a note from the company saying ""We'll give you a free wireless charger if you post a review on this product. But, shhh, don't publicize this."" Should have known that was BS. I followed the directions given, posted the review, and then provided proof via pasting the review title into a field and submitting. Never heard anything back and never received my wireless charger.",1,1,2020-1-21,1,1,0
"Unfortunately, as another reviewer stated these headphones crackle/crunch during intense parts of music at any volume when connected to my S7 Edge. The bass is nice and the convenience can't be beat but I would not recommend these headphones for anyone interested in high fidelity music playback. Also I have to keep my phone in my right pocket or they constantly drop and regain signal. I think if you bought them at the lightning deal price (which they seem to hit every week or two) you'd likely be pleased with them. I made the mistake of buying them at full price on impulse and am regretting it. If you aren't dissuaded by the sound quality and connection issues at least add them to your wish list and wait for the notification of the lightning deal.",3,1,2019-6-23,1,1,0
"Let me start off by saying the sound these bad boys produce is amazing, slightly deep base mixed with perfect treble. Right out of the box I was blown away by the sound & fit! I’ve tried 5 different pairs over the last week and these fit like a dream!!! The noise canceling is decent as well. I cut the lawn after playing with them for an hour after opening them and I could barely hear anything but the sweet sounds of Queen, Eminem, & Mitch Hedburg (don’t judge) As for the battery, I takes me a solid 3 1/2 to 4 hours and they lasted longer then that. The only reason I’m giving 2 stars is due to the fact that the left channel will randomly go out at least every other song for a second before coming back and if I hold my hand close to either ear it cuts the left earbud out every time, I’ve tried re-pairing, resetting, and everything the manual says to no avail. But for the price you really can’t go wrong and I’m hoping I maybe just have a defective left earbud? Time will tell. I do wish they had a ‘skip ⏩ and previous ⏪’ feature but it’s not a selling point for me. Finally the wireless charger case works fantastic. If I didn’t have a issue with the left bud cutting out these would be a easy 5 stars much better then my Bose, AirPods, and Rowkin. (UPDATE) Tozo customer service contacted me and is sending me a replacement pair, no charge. Told me to keep the old ones too. Awesome customer service! They responded in less then 24 hours and are fixing the issue. Outstanding, thank you Tozo!!!",5,1,2019-6-10,1,1,0
"I actually just received and opened these literally 20 minutes ago. In this short time I've developed a deep love affair with these. I work as a kitchen manager for outback steakhouse, and the most important tool I bring with me to work everyday are my headphones. They have to be bluetooth and they can't be terribly expensive because I'm rough on devices when in that environment, so the normal shelf life for a pair of headphones is about 4 months and normally the wheels are falling off the device by then. It's never hard to find the right price when shopping for new headphones, but believe all wireless headphones are NOT created equally. The last pair of wireless individual buds were HORRIBLE. They had touch sensor buttons on the buds. If you even had the slightest bit of moisture on your finger the bud would read it as you holding it down to power off the device. When I opened these new buds that's the 1st thing I looked for, and YES its physical buttons instead of touch sensors. I know its the future but everything doesn't have to be touch screen activated. Regular buttons have been a pretty sound technological staple throughout its history after development. Sorry that that was my main selling point. Besides the buttons, every aspect of these so far have exceeded my normal disappointing feelings that normally accompany a new earbud purchase. Sound quality is the loudest clearest I've heard yet in an ear bud. I haven't had the chance to test its battery's life duration,  but it would have to drain like a tub to dissuade me from being as happy a customer as I am right now. In my opinion you need not look further than these if your in the market for top quality earbuds at a fraction the price it's big Name Brand Competitors charge. These are better than apple Air Buds in my opinion, but unfortunately they have the expensive price tag that alerts all the trendy , middle aged, followers that there is a new expensive apple  POS device that they all must buy. For no other reason than its triple the price of its PC counterparts while still maintaining its sub standard device  functionality. Small price to pay when  making those baby boomers feel like they are part of a group involving technology. They may have NO clue how to use and operate apple products but they sure feel cool getting out their IPhone like everyone else even though they cant seem to figure out how to get past  the security unlock feature on their phones home page. Because they are all under the impression that apple and PC are the same. Both computers. So they are very frustrated when you cant answer any of their apple questions because you are part of the overwhelming majority in the world that use PC and windows not apple.  Kinda went off on a tangent rant there. Sorry. To sum it up...earbuds bad ass, great price, better than any of the expensive Name Brand Counterparts out there",5,1,2020-5-17,1,1,0
"The headphones themselves are great. Very easy to use, easy to pair. They come with different adjustments to fit any ear, which I appreciate. The charging is lighting fast both for the earphones and the case itself. They pair well. I haven't tested the waterproof feature too much but they have gotten some water on them and they were fine. I am truly amazed of the noice cancellation! They are fantastic at blocking out the noise to only focus on what's playing in yours ears. This leads me to my only gripe with this set. I bought these because I read that they were the best bang for your buck that didn't sacrifice sound quality too much but that's not very accurate. At low to medium volumes it sounds fine, even quite good, but after about the halfway volume mark it sounds...cheap. Like that staticky/underwater sound you get with really cheap or slightly broken headphones. I tried seeing if there were ways to adjust the bass or sound that wasn't just volume but there wasn't any. I'm disappointed at the sound quality past a certain volume tbh. But alas, it is what it is. If you're looking for a quick easy pair for every day use and you don't mind the sound quality too much, these will work great.  If you're a sucker for great sound, then I suggest you splurge a little extra for other ones. THAT being said: they actually have pretty amazing customer service! So despite my initial somewhat disappointment with sound quality vs volume, their customer service really makes up for it (not to mention they are a pretty great set overall). Would recommend!",4,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"I like how these fit snug in my ear without adding anything! The battery life is really good, and when one side goes dead, I can take the other ear piece out and use it while the first one is being charged! Battery life lasted around 6 hours from just talking on the phone (not sure how long if you are playing music). The downside is that when I’m on the phone, the other person says that I sound like really far away and can barely hear me. So, I disconnect it then reconnect and it works perfectly! Sometimes this has to be done several times throughout my phone calls. The other downside is that your music sounds distorted if you turn it up too loud (for my iPhone, it was ok at a little over the halfway volume). Overall, for the price, not bad!",3,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"If you need wireless earbuds seriously consider getting these!!! The sound is amazing on them, I don't even have my volume halfway up and it sounds great.

"I got these so my kids would stop asking to borrow my airpods, then I read some medical articles about Bluetooth and developing brains and they don’t get either and I use both, both switching between with my iPhone and iPad.  The AirPods are better integrated for easier use, the T10 you must wait for the right unit to connect to the left before you connect your iDevice to it.  BUT ... they block outside sound better.  Better for watching movies in a car or plane.  I also work out with a T10 in right ear and Netflix playing on the iPad, left ear an AirPod with my Bodyweight app coaching my workout.  The T10 does have to be pushed back into my ear once or twice a workout, the AirPods never.  Totally fine and worth it.  T10’s Definitely Recommended.",5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"I bought these mainly to wear underneath my hearing protection earmuffs while I do yardwork, because my AirPods don’t fit due to the “stem”. These are super compact and fit easily inside the ear cups, and the rubber seals actually seem to help block out even more noise. Battery life seems to be a few hours - haven’t actually had them die on me yet, so plenty for my purposes. Sound quality is pretty good, though I’m not an audiophile and I’m mostly using them with a lawn tractor in the background.I’ve also used them for some phone calls, and while they seem to pick up some background noise, I’ve had no major complaints from other people on the calls.",4,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0

I've worked some 12+ HR days.Now let's talk about the customer service. I emailed them about one of my earbuds breaking due to getting wet. They sent me another one free of charge without even making me send the broken one back. I was just going to order a new one.",5,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
"My daughter had an older version of these buds and I really liked them. These are just as good. They charge and hold charge well. I get two full uses of the earbuds before I have to charge the case. I fell asleep with them in and they were still playing in the morning. They fit well and sound great for the price point. If I wanted studio quality sound, I'd pay a lot more money. My only issue is that they're sensitive to touch. If I have to take one out to listen to something else or adjust it, I have to be super careful about how I touch the earbud or I'll affect the playing. Mine didn't come with instructions, so I'm not even sure what controls I have by tapping on them. They're great in every other way though.",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
I’m always skeptical about witless BT headphones.  They never seem to work as advertised and way over hyped.

"I have been on the hunt for a good, solid pair of wireless headphones for a few months. This purchase was my second try. I didn't realize how important sound quality was until I tried these. The sound isn't great at all = especially if you had quality non-wireless/regular headphones to compare to. Also, the left earbud keeps falling out. I adjusted the cushion pads to the size appropriate for me, but the left continues to come out. It even fell out and into the toilet. Not good - though I can now verify that they still worked after having been submerged in toilet water!! I'm returning these and will continue my hunt for a good, secure earbuds.

"Small and compact. Very comfortable fit in my ear.  Sound is very clear and crisp.  Right volume unlike some other brands that the volume were too low could not hear very well even when we turned the volume all the way up.  The TOZO T10 earbuds is great for the price and the quality can be compared to the expensive brand name buds.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I work at the airport, people lost their earbuds all the time, including me.  I lost 2 of my very expensive ones.  Surprisingly, I never lost the cheap ones even when I left them around charging or forgotten.  Nobody turned the expensive ones in even with my name and phone number labeled on it.  No one touched the cheap ones.  I told myself I will never to buy expensive earbuds again.  When I saw this one I said I'll try this one.  The price is in the middle range and hope the quality should not be too bad and better than the cheaper ones I got.  This way I will enjoy the music and the movies with this and would not get too upset if I lose another buds.  I am not disappointed with the quality.  Hopefully, I will not lose this one either because it's not an expensive brand name buds.",5,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
"Like most that get these type of headphones, I recently got these to carry around for those moments when I just needed to tune out and didn't want to worry about wires when I was working with my hands and running. On my first test, I took them out and intended to pair them with my watch, a Garmin Fenix 5+. They paired pretty well, but during the run the sound dropped multiple times and rendered them unusable with the watch. I will see what troubleshooting I can do, as I do notice a drop in quality with other headphones paired with the watch but not to this level. When I use them with my phone, they seem to work much better. Given the portability factor, I think it fair to expect them to pair with portable devices, but since there is much that can go into an effective streaming, I decided to give this middle ground review.Update: changing this review to 5 stars because the company works hard to resolve issues.

"I wanted to love these so much. I bough them specifically to use with my Peloton bike. I love the charging case, and they do stay charged for a very long time. The downside- and it's a big one- is that they will not stay in my ears (I'm a female with average ? sized ears). No matter what angle I put them in at, which direction I rotate them, which size ear piece I use- they don't stay in. I don't know if it's a combination of a bad fit plus sweat, but I have to constantly reposition them. It's so annoying. The sound is good and it's a shame because I'm going to need to purchase a different pair. My husband tried them for running and had the exact same issues of them slipping out constantly.",2,1,2020-9-18,1,1,0
"I Just received these and after pairing them up and throwing on my Spotify I was completely Blown Away!!! The High's, The Mid-range and The Bass are 100% Spot On. These actually compare to my Hi-Rez SteelSeries Pro head set.I originally bought these for the audio while I'm streaming Netflix. But to hear the music this good it's huge plus. They also feel comfortable in the ear with extra nibs for that perfect fit. And without a doubt they are noise cancelling. I am giving this review on my mechanical keyboard that is a bit loud and can not hear my key strokes. Plus I live in New York City and can not hear a thing outside, I'm loving that !!!",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0

"These ear buds work but the sound is not great. Also, there are a few other problems. The case won't hold a charge. After a few days it goes from fully charged to discharged. Every time I use the ear buds, I hold the button until I hear ""Power Off"" before I put them away, but still have to charge the case every few days. So far, I haven't found the earbuds to be fully discharged This happens whether or not I use the earbuds between chargesAnother issue is the ear buds fall out of my ears. I went to change the sizing caps and couldn't find any in the box. I tried to contact Tozo several times to see if I could get another set. I never heard back from them.",2,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"I am in love!!!!! I got the nude color match my skin tone. With my hair down I can wear one at work and no one knows! I wear them everyday at work, 8 hrs or longer switching up ears (I can only wear one so I can hear the customers) I left it at work over the weekend and was still able to listen to them on Monday. Found out by accident that they wirelessly charge as well. Great quality for low priceUPDATE- Still going strong. I use these at least 5 days a week sometimes my entire 8 hour shift. I have even left them at work over the weekend after using them all week and was still able to use them a couple more days on charge. Phone call quality is FANTASTIC. I like that I can use either just one, or both if I want to totally ignore everything!!!",5,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"Almost.Fully charged them, put them in and the sound was immediately suspect, super undefined and mushy.. tried many different EQ adjustments, rebooted them a couple time, different ear positions, nothing I could do would make these sound even as good as some basic wireless Skullcandy jibs. Poor definition, warbly wireless background noise.. basically what I feared. Returning them and looking for something with good drivers and proper tx.",3,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"I bought these in May, and they worked great for a week. I after a week, the left earbud began to cut in and out. Well, now anytime I wear these while doing yardwork, running, or working out, the left earbud cuts out completely, for a solid 30-45 seconds each. Not very happy about these. Had great sound quality, blocked out noise, and were easy to use. I just wish they worked. I wouldn't recommend these earbuds. Save up and buy the Samsung Gear earbuds.UPDATE:",1,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
You have to take the right out first and then the left.  But do it quickly with in 10 seconds or the buds could not pair up.They are easy to rest.  I gave a pair to a friend who messed up the pairing.  It takes less than 30 seconds to fix.,4,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"I really enjoy these headphones! They're small enough for me to wear at work to listen to music without having a long cord to worry about or tuck away. The range on these is awesome. I have a tri-level home and can walk away from my phone with Bluetooth connected on all levels of the house. The bass is good, obviously not as strong as over-the-ear headphones would be, but it's sufficient enough to enjoy my music, and that's coming from someone who listens to hip-hop, rap, dubstep, trance, etc.My one complaint... and unfortunately it's enough to make me return the headphones... is that when making calls the person on the other end can't hear me. I wanted to be able to talk on the phone with my husband while handling house chores and wrangling our 1 year old. I can hear him just fine, but the mic on these isn't strong enough to pick up my voice.",4,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"First the important stuff that covers most people... The sound quality is great, and people seem to hear me ok Those re important factors. Don't have enough experience yet with battery life.

"Amazing headphones! I was looking for an affordable pair of wireless earbuds that I could use for more risky activities such as the gym, skateboarding, snowboarding, etc. (I have a pair of Apple AirPods which are also great, but I’d be beating myself up too much if they were lost or broken). For the money these earbuds are a steal!Sound quality: Amazing sound quality, superb highs, mids and deep booming bass. Probably some of the best quality drivers I’ve heard for such an affordable price.",4,1,2020-7-5,1,1,0
"The have a very good sound quality. Bass is decent for their size. They sync up to each other every time you take them out of the charger and it only takes a second. Nothing for you to do, it happens automatically.Once paired to your phone, they will connect to it automatically whenever you take the right earbud out of the  charger.  This also happens quickly.",5,1,2019-4-9,1,0,0
Very okay.I really wanted these to be as awesome as they look but they just ARE Not! I love the design and the color is great! But After only 3 uses they were not able to both remain connected to Bluetooth and the sounds starting cutting in and out!! I didn’t even expose them to water even though they are suppose to be “water proof “YEAH RIGHT.They were Soo annoying! I eneded up just using my iPhone speaker because dealing with their inconsistent performance got way too frustrating. At first The sound was very okay. Comparable to the headphones you pick up at the dollar store that only work a few times. Like I said I’m very disappointed! I really was trying to over look the negative reviews and give them the benefit of the doubt but they are just not good.,2,1,2020-9-10,1,1,1

"These TOZO wireless Bluetooth earbuds are amazing!  I had purchased a pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds from another manufacturer on Amazon a couple of months ago, however I became extremely frustrated with them due to the fact that they practically had a ""hair trigger"" response and even the slightest touch would change just about everything. That being said, these TOZO earbuds are an absolute GEM.  They turned on and paired immediately after taking them out of the charging box. As soon as I initially paired them with my tablet, I was getting fantastic sound quality. The bass is excellent, and most of the outside noise was blocked out. I normally only use these when I am watching a movie on my tablet when I am flying.  The only thing they do not do is control the volume, but that was not an issue for me; the volume is very easy changed by a touch of a button on my tablet. To me, that is one less thing you have to worry about when you are trying to enjoy your wireless earbuds. The less buttons (or how long you have to hold this one or that one down for this or that) you have to think about is what works for me. They stay in my ears with no discomfort whatsoever. Good job TOZO!!!",5,1,2019-8-16,1,0,0
"My first impression was that I was sen the wrong color. I ordered white and got dark grey, so that was a bummer. The reason I was drawn to these headphones is because they are advertised as waterproof. I like to swim and thought it would be cool to swim while listening to books and podcasts. Unfortunately this did not work out for two reasons. 1st, the headphones didn't maintain a connection from one end of a 25 meter pool to the other and 2nd, the touch surfaces of the headphones are so sensitive that just bringing my head in and out of the water would rewind, or turn up the volume or trigger some other unwanted result. Perhaps there are settings that fix this, but I haven't found them yet. Outside the pool they work pretty well. Sometimes they don't sync quite right, but after some fiddling I can get them to work. So far the battery life is great and I like the convenience of the charging case. I wouldn't recommend them to a friend, but I'm still using them because I don't want to purchase something else. Definitely don't get these if your main purpose for wanting them is swimming.",3,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"I actually bought 4 pairs of these, one for each member of the family.  After looking through Amazon for a good pair of bluetooth headphones it was nice to find some with REAL reviews for the product listed.  These Tozo T10 headphones have been great so far.  The charging case has 4 LEDs that show it's power level, and the headphones themselves have a little light that lights up when they're charging as well. The charging case cover is translucent so you can see the charging light and the headphone light through it, so you don't have to open it to know the status of either.  Sound quality has been fine and calls work well on them.  We have 4 iPhones in the house that these are connected to and we've not had any pairing or connection issues.  Wireless charging seems to work fine as well, or you can use the supplied USB cable to charge the case if you don't have a wireless charging pad. Overall we're very happy with the 4 pairs we have and would recommend these to anything who is looking for a fairly inexpensive pair of bluetooth earbuds.",5,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"I like pretty much everything about these earbuds but if you want to work in the yard or exercise, they will fall out. They say that you just need to make sure you have the right fittings for your ear size (and they include several size options) but even finding the best fit for my ear they still are not secure enough if your head is moving for an extended period. I think they would be fine if you are biking as your head isn't moving that much but running or yard work is not the best.Solutions: Get the lightweight neck gaiter to keep them in place.",4,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"I mainly bought this due to it's ability to not break in water, and it's wireless charging capability.  There were good reviews about the sound quality that sealed the deal for me. The sound quality is very good, but like all earbuds the fit has to be good for that to happen.  I had some issues getting the buds to stay in my ear for long periods so that was my gripe about it.  I think if the buds were shaped better, it would fit in the ear more securely.  Also there's a button, but could have been programmed more usefully.  Instead of double-click for re-dial (which I would probably never use).  having it skip forward/backward would be more useful.  I understand this is a preference, but I'm just stating my preference.I would rate these a 4.5 and their customer service 5.",5,1,2019-2-12,1,1,0
"I've been thinking for a while about getting some wireless earbuds. I wear headphone at the gym connected to my phone and am constantly hitting the wire, knocking my phone down, and looking like a fool to get off my machine and scramble to pick everything up. This will happen NO MORE. These sweet little numbers connected to my phone perfectly with no issues. I love that there are different sizes available to use for a snug fit in my ears. I opted for the smaller size as even other ear buds would fall out of my ears. With my first test drive, I happily put on my music and the song drowned out the sounds of my daughter singing in the shower. They are truly noise cancelling. My husband was even impressed and is considering a pair for him. He mows lawns and can never hear his phone. The only downfall is the 3 hour battery life, which for a normal person, may be perfect. These little things pack a punch and I couldnt be happier.",5,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"And by good volume, I mean these things are loud! And that's saying something since my hearing isn't as good as it used to be. But that's good for me. Having to turn down the volume is not something I'm used to. I did notice that the range on these is very short and if I sit on my cellphone or leave it in the living room and go into my bedroom, the reception drops. So you have to keep your phone on you and not sit on it when using these. But aside from that, these things are cool! And comfortable. I no longer have a cord dangling and getting caught on things while I clean the house. The little charging case is cute and practical. And the ear inserts are that nice soft rubber and comes in 3 different sizes. I bought this on sale for $25 for my kid, borrowed them and liked them so much that I bought another set for myself when the price had gone back up to $50. If that tells you anything.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"The worst issue with these is they don’t stay in your ears. I’ve tried each size tip included and they will not stay in; constantly falling out. I need to wear headbands around my head at the ear level over these to keep them in. This is not good in workouts because the headband retains sweat, feels uncomfortable, and doesn’t stay in one place so I’m constantly adjusting. But it’s the only way I can think of to keep this in my ears.  I couldn’t return these within the window allowed because of the Covid crisis or else I would have. Now I’m stuck with them until I lose one or both because they keep falling out. Unless there is some other solution for keeping them in your ears, I will unhappily use these until they are lost and then I won’t buy them again.",2,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
"Ok. I got this product on super sale $39. Good deal. My first unit worked great but had problems cutting out and one side failed. I sent a message but for price expected, nada. But was pleaseantly surprised within a few hours I got an email..... Wow!! They sent a new unit out and got it 2 days later. Told me to keep the old one. Awesome.Second pair has worked great and consistent for nearly 6months now.",4,1,2019-9-8,1,0,0
I bought these because my old Samsung S7 is starting to get old and the headphone jack is start to wear out.These have thumping base and loud sounds. Clarity is good. Loud though only head phones I have to turn down to 70% volume. It was made with alot of bass in mind.,5,1,2019-7-19,1,1,0

"This is probably the last time I will waste money on wireless earbuds from Amazon. I tried them out about 2 years ago and couldn't find a pair that lasted more than a few months before the batteries wouldn't recharge or the charge port was ruined.  I figured that maybe the technology needed some work, so I went back to wearing clunky wireless headsets for a few years.  I read the reviews for these headphones and figured that maybe enough time and versions have come out and that they might work better now.  Wrong.  These earbuds arrived quickly, but the left earbud won't charge at all and now won't even turn on.  This is actually WORSE than it was 2 years ago.  At least I used to be able to get some use out of them before they broke.  I am hoping Tozo will replace the broken earbud, but they haven't gotten back to me yet.I am so disappointed that I waited 2 years, spent more money and it was broken before it even arrived.  I just want to be able to do my chores around the house without having to drag a speaker and my phone wherever I go.  I guess I will be sticking to headsets for a few more years, or until more care is put into making the product.",2,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"I had originally titled this review... ""Completely unreliable in terms of continuous connectivity... look elsewere"".  But, after customer service got involved, I have revised my review.  Here is the original review, and the updated review after customer service intervention.Original Review:  I had high hopes for these earbuds, but alas there were completely unreliable.  After receiving, I fully charged the earbuds, connected them via Bluetooth to my iPhone and played through part of a song.  I was overjoyed with the sound quality.  That's where everything goes downhill.  On my first run with these earbuds they continually cutout.  Talk about annoying.  I tried placing my phone in my hand, in my pocket, etc.  I tried ""forgetting"" the device in Bluetooth settings and reconnecting.  No change.  In a 30 minute jog they must have cut out 100 times.  Back they go, and the search is on for a more reliable product.",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"For being a brand name I have never heard of these earbuds have really impressed. It comes with multiple sizes of interchangeable squishy ear peices, however the size that came pre installed works great for me. You could even use a different size for each ear if your canals are of differing sizes.The charging case opens and closes using magnets, and the whole thing has a nice weight to it. It feels well made and durable for pocket carry. The earbuds click into their respective charging slots via magnetics as well.",4,1,2019-1-29,1,0,0
"I only had them one day so I can’t really say anything about the battery life, which explains the 4 stars. As it says the bass is pretty strong for wireless earbuds. Noise cancellation isn’t horrible, but if you have it a medium volume you pretty much can’t hear anything. These are definitely for you if you want somewhat cheap wireless earbuds with pretty good noise cancellation, great sound, and ESPECIALLY if you like your music LOUD. The loudness is the only reason I’m returning after just one day.",4,1,2020-6-6,1,1,0
"Apparently I have smaller than average ears (or ear canals) because earbuds that seem to fit everyone else with no problem never fit me. They always immediately fall out. I bought these based on some reviews from people having similar issues stating these worked for them, and I'm so glad I did.When I first received them, however, I was missing the smallest size ear cap. You're supposed to get small, medium, large, and extra-large. I got two mediums, large, and extra-large. So I contacted the company at the email listed on the instruction booklet. I heard back very quickly, and they sent me the small ear caps. Sure enough, that's the size I needed!",5,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"I mainly bought these to use for phone calls and the mic is horrible.  I can hear the other person perfect but they say it sounds like I'm talking into a can on the other side of the room and all the background noise is picked up.  For ear buds part, they are amazing.  I am able to use them at the gym and hear what I'm listening to and all the gym noise is not an issue.  I can use them at work for pretty much the full 8 hour work day before needing to be charged.  I typically have a hard time finding ear buds that fit and do not fall out but not with these.  They don't even wiggle loose at the gym.  If I had bought these with the main purpose only being ear buds I would definitely give 5 stars, the poor phone call quality dropped the rating down.",4,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"I have tried several wireless earbuds lately.  I only use these for music and I use them daily at the gym.  Sound quality was good, noise cancellation was decent, battery life of ear buds was OK. battery life of case was below expectation.  I had to recharge the case every few days whereas other earbuds the case charge would last several weeks.  The case would lose a charge quickly rather it was being used or not.Initially I had connectivity issues with the left earbud.  The sound would be intermittent when in use.  Customer support was excellent and sent me a new pair and I have no connectivity issues with the new pair.  Yay!",3,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"I decided to try the TOZO T10 earbuds after bad experiences with two sets of ""i-something"" buds. The sound quality is good, they fit comfortably in my ears well thanks to the various size of ear caps included. They fit snugly without falling out during moderate movement, such as walking. If I were going to use in a workout situation, I would probably go for a model that has some kind of behind ear hooks. I like the waterproof case; there is a slight magnetism that draws the buds into charging position. There is a USB port for wired charging and it also supports wireless charging. I use with my existing wireless charger for my Samsung Galaxy phone where they reach full charge in a couple of hours. The charge lasts for at least 3 hours of listening to music.The T10 earbuds may lack the ""cool"" look of the i-something buds. I wear them to listen to music and e-books at the pool. They are a bit large, so if you have smallish ears, they may not be for you.  Other than that, if you're looking for earbuds that fit well and work well, then these may be worth a try!",5,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0

The company sent me a new pair to try, and although the microphone works better, I still have to talk loudly for the person I am talking to can clearly hear me.The microphone aspect to the earbuds still does need improvement, but I can give this second set a 3-star rating. I appreciate the company's determination to try to make the product right. Good customer service for sure.",3,1,2019-5-19,1,2,0
"So I’ve had these earbuds for a few months now. I wanted to wait a little while before I reviewed them. For the price, the sound quality is great. With the caveat that they must be seated in your ears properly. That’s where the problem is for me. They come with several different sizes of tips, but none of them seem to work well for me. Especially with the R sided bud. That is the primary side and what you pair your phone to. So that’s the one I use the most, I like to have one ear open so I can hear what’s going on around me. That one is really kind of broken in, so it really gets loose and I’m constantly having to adjust it. If you are planning on using these for vigorous exercise, I would look for a product that is more sport focused. Just walking around the grocery store, I’m constantly readjusting because they keep wanting to fall out. Also, their warranty is tied to leaving a 5 star review here, so I think that’s why they rate so high. They aren’t terrible and for the price they aren’t bad at all. But, just know that they could be better for staying in place.",3,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
"Not a bad set of ear buds, the sound quality is pretty okay. The mids and lows are actually pretty decent, the battery will last 3+ hours on a single charge. The ear cups are so-so, none of them were a good fit and let a lot of ambiant sound through, after I swapped them out for tri-cup style tips I had no more problems. The volume was another issue I had, they are a little on the quiet side even at full phone Bluetooth volume.Overall for the price these are a good and sturdy set of ear buds, it would he nice to have forward, back, and volume control unless I just don't know about it.",4,1,2019-11-14,1,1,0

"These earbuds have great sound quality for the price! I'm a teacher and, like most teachers, have had to transition to online teaching. I bought these as a substitute for a headset because I thought perhaps it would make me look less like a telemarketer and more like the presence that students saw in a classroom.  Honestly, I hear everything superbly and most students report that they can hear me just fine but I do wonder if my speech would be a bit less echo-ey if I had a headset with a mic.  The battery lasts a long time and the charging case is definitely a bonus to, ah, CHARGE the earbuds and keep them safe. I also love that the case recharges on a wireless charger.  Most definitely worth the money especially if you are only using it for occasional phone calls.",5,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"I really appreciate the build, they don't feel cheap, the case doesn't seem cheap. Apparently it uses magnets to help keep it shut and it has an actual hinge instead of a plastic strip as a hinge which would eventually break. So far so good. Pairing is really easy. Range varies and you can get drop outs at 50 feet. Battery life is about 4 hours depending on volume levels. I like the case also charges it, it has it's own battery. I suspect it can recharge the ear pieces 4 times before needing charged itself. It comes with extra rubber ear pieces that are different sizes depending on ear size. The bigger the better, really helps with bass. Not as much bass as I'm used to but it has plenty of volume. I don't even crank my phone all the way up and it's plenty loud",4,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
I was wrong!! After hitting submit I found that the media and audio settings on the phone were not correct. I had to dig deeper in the audio on phone. Once done the audio went where I expected.

"This is the out the box review. So far everything is there and working fine. The right ear paired a little faster then the left ear. But after a few tries it finally connected. The sound is awesome so far. I had to change out the ear bud pieces because the one that came with them were a little to big and kept falling out. Once I switched the fit was perfect. You can use one ear bud at a time since I mostly use then for talking. So far I haven't had any problems with calls, I've talked to 3 different people and no one said anything about not being able to hear me. Love the fact that it comes with like an keychain attachment or attach it to your bag make it less likely to loose. It does charge on the wireless charger with no problems. I will update the review after a few while since I've only had them one day.Update: So its been a month since I had these ear buds and I must say I'm kind of disappointed with them. The first day they worked like a champ after that nothing but problems. My right ear bud constantly cuts out. You can not have your phone to far away from you. I had my phone in the living room charging while I was in the kitchen washing dishes and they kept cutting out. Sometimes I can be heard other times I can't. Its hit and miss. They fit pretty decent with the small pods but still have to adjust them from time to time while doing Activities. The sound for music is about the best thing with these ear buds. With both ear buds in you can nearly hear your surroundings so that is a plus. This is still a decent product for the price but they need a little more work done to them. Not the worst but not the best.",3,1,2020-2-28,1,0,1
"I liked the cost for one I really did not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a set of wireless earbuds and these were definitely worth it to buy.  To start when you receive the product it comes with a variety of buds that you can replace on the actual Bluetooth devices to fit your ear better, this makes it so almost anyone can use this as long as they take the time to find their size.  Secondly its sound-quality is very good it cancels out most sounds which I like for meditation and it can play music very loudly.  Next its Bluetooth range is very far, I can leave my phone on my desk and walk around the house while still listening to my music and enjoying it.  Lastly its battery life, whenever I go anywhere for the weekend I bring it to a full charge at my house and the battery on the storage container lasts me those WHOLE weekend without having to charge it again and I use it a lot.  All in all I love these headphones they look sleek in the ear and work great for me.. it was a pretty good find.",5,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
"These things are literally amazing. I have small ears and have a difficult time getting any type of ear bud to fit. Airpods HURT. I tried Beats. But I always default back to my old fashioned wired ear buds because they feel great to wear. But, I got a note10+ and it doesn't have a port WOMP WOMP so wireless buds are a necessity now. Found these with multiple size ear plugs, hoping for the quality to match and it does. Even my husband, who is a stickler getting name brands for electronics, loves them. I found SO MANY reviews saying you can't skip songs or go back when listening to music... but you can. If they read the instructions that came with them, they'd see in full detail how to navigate through it all. ive personally tried all of these and they work. i attached the picture for those of you who dont bother to go through everything ;)",5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,1
"UPDATE: After  4 months, the right ear bud went out, I then used only the left. The left started to loose connectivity after 6 months. Also about this same time the case charging failed to hold any charge at all. After 9 months the left BT failed completely. I contacted TOZO. The rep communicated with me and requested an explanation of the failure. After sent that info and a few more emails back and forth, they sent out a sparkling new set. TOZO totally honored the warranty and in my case, I was in the 11th month by the time the replacement was in hand. I really appreciate TOZO honoring the product promise. just like my surprise at the original performance, i was also surprised to have so much attention when i had a problem. (ORIGINAL: You don’t expect much in the price range, however these exceed expectation. Very good sound... with decent highs and lows.. the ear foam allow the correct size at least for my ears. The fit is nice and comfortable. The batteries give several hours of use... overall I can’t complain one bit... nice set)",5,1,2019-6-22,1,0,0
"My first pair worked fine except with my iPhone 11 Pro Max. The original pair would skip and the audio would drop out. Tozo immediately sent me a replacement pair that worked perfectly with the iPhone 11. The second pair appeared to be an upgraded version that also included more sizes of earpads which meant I had no trouble finding the right size for my ears. I gotta say, for the price these earbuds sound excellent. Solid bass and excellent mids. The highs aren't too bright or harsh. Stereo separation is excellent. Regarding the mic, I called several people and asked them to rate the voice quality on the call - all said they couldn't tell the difference and didn't know I was speaking through my bluetooth earbuds and not my phone. I highly recommend these earbuds!",5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"I have a set of wired Bose NC earbuds which costed over $200,  but don't use them much because of the wired connection.  IMHO, these sound just as good without the inconvenient wires.  They are comfortable, have a quality build to them, and come in a nice charger case small enough for a pocket.  For the price, this is a great value, and after testing these, I am glad I did not buy more  expensive choices.  If these had ANC (which I personally don't need), that would be a nice update though.  I have not experienced the dropout that others report.  Once they connect, they play consistently.If I was going to nitpick, my only distraction are no volume control on the earbuds.  Yet I'm fine adjusting volume on my devices.  Considering all the pro's of these earbuds, it's still a great value and would not hesitate to purchase again.",4,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"Keeping price point in mind, $32, they seem like a fair bargain. The bass is good. The sound is pretty clear. Case is really nice. The 2 issues I've run into are connectivity and the fit. I have experienced some cutting in/cutting out here and there when I attempt to adjust the fit of the buds. I'd like to think I have normal sized ear canals and even with the smallest bud pieces I have to jam them in pretty hard to get them to stay. Not great. Certainly don't think I can get use to it. I did purchase some different foam tips to see if that'll alleviate jamming them in my ears for the right fit for me. Update, day two.... Got the foam tips, world  of a difference! If you have smaller ear canals, get the foam tips.",4,1,2020-2-7,1,1,0
"The charging case is convenient. It uses a standard base charger and holds a charge so you can replace your earbuds in the case and recharge without having to plug in. However, the mic on these ear buds is worthless. I tried for a few months in different ambient settings to see if the mic would pick up my voice-no luck. I bought these earbuds specifically for use with my phone to make hands free phone calls and take conference calls. These earbuds are not useful for this type of application. I wish I could return these or get a refund, however, on Amazon, the return window has run out and they do not provide support for this product within the year it was purchased. Also, I was able to get both earbuds to work simultaneously for the first two weeks. After that, only one earbud will turn on at a time. I use an iPhone for reference.",1,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"I had just returned name brand headphones and selected these as a replacement. I am glad I did.Great headphones for the price. Reading reviews helps and I would say these are mid range quality earbuds and are at a price that provide value. Bass is strong at times and present throughout music when needed. Treble sounds decent no bad complaints. Expected wireless static at times cannot be counted against the product as you cannot change radio theory this way. Battery time has not drained all the way in the ear buds yet and have been listening for countless hours (3-4 hours in spurts)  throughout the day at high volume...all while using the battery pod which DID drain daily (about 3 charges back to back). But quick recharge with wired or wireless charger was no issue. I give this product 5 starts. Yes it lacks perfect sound clarity at times and isn't state of the art. Although, for what you pay for it balances out. I believe this will last and I enjoy a good sounding earphone and these sound great.",4,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0
"After reading prior reviews and seeing the price I was more than a bit skeptical, but bought them anyway.  Well, to say that I was impressed is almost an understatement.  Nice little case that also is the charger, works perfectly.  I tried various ear buds and found that the middle one seemed to fit my ear the best.  Then there is the sound quality.  Those who said it had good base response were right on.  These almost have too much base on some of the music I listen too, but that is not a bad thing.  Overall fidelity is very good.  I have only been using them for two days but the fit is perfect and I usually forget I am wearing them, until my wife talks to me and I don't respond (LOL).  I have not had a chance to determine how long they will play on a charge but will probably do that in the next couple of days.  Overall this is an excellent purchase for anyone who wants a light weight ear bud that fits firmly and has good fidelity, with exceptional base.",5,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
"I purchased these on my birthday April 2019. I've been using them on and off sometimes spending more than a month between using them.  I recently started using them again very frequently as it's not feasible for me to use my (expensive) BT speaker at work.  I will have to state, at least with mine, the charging case does discharge when sitting idle.  I have noticed multiple times while it sat in my rucksack that the earbuds were paired to my phone because the battery drained out of the case and thus turned on the earbuds.  Not a big deal though.  I have flown a few times recently and the noise cancellation was good enough that I couldn't really hear the airplane engines very well.  And even while on an airplane, I've set them around 50% volume which lasts for the total 4 hour leg of a flight.  I'm a bass head, and I'm very happy with the lows these provide.  Highs and mids are also very pleasant.I recently ran into an issue where the right earbud would cut out for a half-second, immediately followed by the left earbud doing the same thing.  And it was happening pretty frequently.  I thought the earbuds were crapping out, but I searched online and found that these can be reset.  I reset them and they are working flawlessly again.",5,1,2020-2-11,1,1,0
"So far so good! I've had wireless earbuds before but they weren't truly wireless. These are, so I'm excited to use them on a regular basis.  I don't have to worry about getting up and dropping my phone because the headphones are still attached or the wires getting tangled or caught on something and being snatched out of my ears.I can't comment on the longevity yet but I will say that they fit snug in my ear (there are four different sized ear cushions), very easy to pair, and the directions are straight to the point. Sound quality is also good. I also noticed that they connect automatically as soon as you put them in your ear.",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"Iphone user: Really love these earbuds and would highly recommend! Sound is crisp and clear and painful if the volume is turned up high. At just the right volume, I can’t hear anything...absolutely nothing. Talking on the phone is no issue either. I can hear the person I’m talking to just fine and vice versa. Haven’t had a good workout with them yet but have used them for major yardwork and bumpy lawnmowing. Stayed in perfectly fine!No major cons. Wish the battery life was longer. If my calculation is correct, I get 3 hours of usage. Considering getting a second pair to swap out during long usage. The charging station/holder is small, so I always keep it fully charged and in my purse. My ears are fairly small and it does seem like the buds protrude out, but nothing to really to complain about.",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"I just received these and haven't yet had a chance to use them during a workout - so if I find things are different I will update my review. The earbuds were extremely easy to pair to my phone. I was thankful they came with so many ear caps as the small ones they came with were too big. I did panic a little because I couldn't find the caps at first, they were in a bag stuck in the bottom of the box with the charging cord. I needed the x-small caps to fit the buds in my ears. The sound quality is great - I like a variety of music - and it all sounded great in the earbuds.The price was right, too. I'm not willing to pay the price of the Apple airpods and have been through a variety of wireless headphones. I've struggled to find a pair that hold a good connection with my phone or that aren't affected by sweat during a workout. I hope these hold up to their claim of being waterproof!",5,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"When I recently purchased these earbuds,  I was looking for great sound for my music, easy connectivity, water resistance, Bluetooth 5.0, and a very clear mic for calls. And while I did find that a few of these needs were definitely met, I was extremely disappointed with the mic and charging capacity.Pros...",3,1,2019-4-28,1,1,0
"So I will be honest, there's things i love about these and a few things I dont like but not enough to return them. Prepare for a long review!!!I LOVE how small and compact the case is. It is convenient since I am not really a purse kind of girl so when I am using one, it's just a tiny little case. Neat idea but also a con for me since i listen to music practically all day.. but each bud has an approx 3 hr battery life and then the case is also a battery pack for the ear buds. There are 4 blue lights that indicate how much charge is left on the case. They are magnetic so when you put them in the case the ""click"" back in so to speak so no worry of them falling out of the case for any reason. The lid is also so magnetic so even better of accidentally dropping and opening.",4,1,2019-2-16,1,0,1
"Didn't want to pay $100+ for a set of BT earbuds. Saw these with a huge amount of reviews and still holding a high star rating.  I'm not disappointed. Great sound; good highs and lows.

"I use my earbud/earbuds for work to talk to clients .... I'm also OCD and wanted to eliminate wires dangling on my desk... my OCD mind can't think in what it perceives as a mess and the wireless charger I've been using since my Note 9 and now Note 10 has one wire anchored to the charging disk and that my mind can deal with.... so my quest to replace my current for a Q1 compliant bud began.  I was drawn to the T10's because they met my criteria but also the high waterproof rating... same as the Galaxy Note... since my business is all with medical often my calls are emergencies and I actually take calls in the shower and out running in the rain. It also said that I can rinse them off under the faucet and that's what I do with my Note as well so added convenience.  But the real surprise came with my music folder...Tozo basically advertised to attract music and entertainment lovers ...so.... I played a variety from Beethoven to Toby Keith, from Pavoratti to Simon and Garfunkel, from Helen Reddy in the 70s to Kellie Pickler in the 21st century...… and my goodness, everything sounded incredible... it was 3D quality.... the singer in the front of me, drummer behind me, musicians on my left and right.... I am in the center of the band!!!  So now instead of swapping back and forth from my Bluetooth buds to my Bluetooth speaker between calls I'm listening through the T10s and let them doing the swapping for me when a call comes through.... that's another added convenience and something else off my desk (the speaker).  Lastly, my price point shopping was between $100 and $200 and these were fifty bucks... but they also came with a no questions asked money back guarantee so with the features they posted I said ""what the heck"".... another thing my OCD mind can't deal with is the clutter of empty boxes laying around... I won't be needing the empty from these buds so I tossed the box.... the only place these buds are going is on the night stand by my bed so they're handy for my ears when middle of the night calls come through from medical facilities!!",5,1,2019-9-29,1,0,0
"I was sooooo sick of one side of corded headphones going dead after a month or two that I decided on bluetooth, but wanting something reasonably priced.

"These headphones have decent sound and stay in if you read the instructions and place in ear then twist but they are also annoying. Unlike other wireless headphones they do not turn off when you put them in the case or come on when you remove them like my other headphones have, if you’re use to this too know you have to manually turn them on and off sometimes separately bc one will 70% of the time not turn the other on at the same time and they have to do a back and forth check with each other. Also playing music is annoying I keep tapping the but with no affect it works once the song plays but if you do anything else on your phone or just put it down while you play music it acts as if there’s no play button bc it randomly half disconnects( I can here every click of this through my headphones yet using theyre button doesn’t play the music I was just listening to even when I went directly under my Apple Music to tap the play button no sound. It’s not my phone since I got these as a back up Incase I lose my current headphones or they mess up and I’m not getting this problem with them) They are constantly annoying so far as of my 2 days with them.",3,1,2020-7-4,1,1,0

Will also post update after few mos of use but so far I love them totally happy with my purchase!!  UPDATE:  these do not last fully charged died after 2 hours and case dies daily when it shouldn't not worth what i paid!!!

"Normally, I stick with the basic wired earphones since I trust them the most, and besides airpods, I haven't heard of any excellent wireless earbuds so I was skeptical to purchase these kinds of products. However, recently, the wired earphones have been getting into the way of my exercising and daily activities and I decided to try this out. It's literally the best purchase I've ever made in regards to this aspect. The sound quality is excellent. I can leave to the restroom while still listening to the same quality of music. I can exercise without wires getting into the way of my movements and these things don't fall out easily. The charging box is great and charges very fast. It also carries a great charge and the earphones have basically never died on me.

After a positive experience with them when recieved thay gitched after 5 months and the Left bud (slave unit) wouldn't connect to the Right (master unit). While I like some BDSM in my life I would prefer my ear buds to behave. Tried many things to get them to be a couple again and the left bud would never submit to the right again. What did the Master right bud do to the Slave left to make it never want it again?Update - They should tell you this in the instructions - Reset works only if you're not in range of any other bluetooth devices.,5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
Haven't had these long but so far they seem solid. Sound quality is good and loud.  They don't seem to cancel noise completley which is fine. They stay in my ear really well. I have been using them while riding my harley with straight pipes and i have expeienced no connectivity issues(other wireless headphones in the past would lose connection when riding. I assumed from vibrations). They even stay in place when i take my helmet off. The buttons on the headphones are not touch sensitive which for me is a plus. Pair the right ear. If you pair the left ear when you turn on the right one it will lose connection. So pairing the left one I assume is for single ear use... so just pair the right one so you can use both and if you only need one just leave the left one in the case... haha I feel like I made that longley overcomplicated. Anyway... this seems like a good bluetooth earbud set so far. If I have anything negative to say i will update this review,5,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0
"I was really surprised by the quality and the comfort of this product. The jury is still out on the battery life, but on and all, seems like a great product. One point of improvement I'd suggest is, to have a small loop on each earbud so you can connect them with a strap to hang them over your neck while not using it. I would also reduce the risk of losing a earbud.EDIT 3/25/20",2,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
Before my purchase i did a little research on affordable wireless earbuds. I have a job where I clean alone by myself for most the night and i like to listen to music. However my corded headphones kept getting the cord in the way and breaking with all the bending to clean i was doing. So i wanted affordable and durable wireless earbuds. After doing my research i chose tozo t10 bc i thought they were the best all around if not the best at any one single thing and seemed like they would last. Ive only had them for a week now but i definitely am happy with my choice. They sound great for me and the noise cancellation is almost too good since i didn't hear my coworker approach me while i was working and listening. The only concern i have is battery life but i haven't had them long enough to know how that will consistently last.,5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"Update to my review below.  They are still too big for my ears, but Tozo reached out to me and asked what they could do to help me out!  Super friendly and helpful! The product is actually really good (if your ears are big enough to accommodate them. )  Overall, the customer service makes it SUPER worth it. :)I bought these because I have tiny ear canals and most earbuds wont work for me.  I hoped these would be different. Not really. They are still too big (even with the smallest adapter). I'm  constantly catching them just as they fall out, or trying hard to shove them back into place.  :(  Sound quality is ok, as long as I don't bend over. Then the sound tends to cut in and out. Very odd.  Battery life is ok, but not great. Only about 4 hours, but I think that is what they said it would be.  Kind of bummed about these actually.",4,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
"Pros: Great sound quality, quick charging, always ready to go! I'm very happy with these. The sound is suburb, good bass, and these actually stay in my ears, as opposed to so many i've tried! My left ear is weird and i cant get regular earbuds to stay in, but the Tozos have no issues. Very surprised. Great value!Cons: a few bugs. sometimes the buds wont connect to eachother right away, and you have to ""reset"" them by placing both back into the case for a second then take them back out and they connect just fine.",5,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"These separate earbuds are setup such that the Left Earbud is connected (wirelessly) to the Right Earbud (not the device).  When the earbuds are too far apart, the Left Earbud cuts out.  No problem, right?  You just put them in your ears and that's the only distance to worry about.  Well, it's a problem if the Left Earbud cuts out when they're in your ears.  I proved this by removing the Right Earbud and holding it mid-way across my face.  When I do that, the Left Earbud cuts out.  I'm able to reproduce this by either putting the Right Earbud in my ear, or simply in an outstretched arm.I've been accused both figuratively and literally of having a big head, but it's silly that the wireless connectivity between the Right Earbud and my phone (in my left pants pocket) is fine, but the connectivity between my ears ... err... between the earbuds in my head is so very, very poor.",1,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"These headphones do have great sound, but the battery life is pathetic - only around 3 hrs if I'm lucky, and seems to be shrinking with each use. I purchased these to use at work, as I often do repetitive tasks and listen to music for hours at a time, but needed wireless so chords wouldn't get in the way. Because of the puny battery life, these unfortunately don't suit well and I had to purchase a second pair of headphones to insure I'll have a way to listen throughout my workday.

I can not usually wear ear buds. They are ALWAYS too big and I can't wait to get them out. But the smallest ear piece on these is pretty comfy. They really sound pretty good.

"I have had these for about 8 months now, and up until about 3 months ago I was going to give them a 1 star review.  I didn't have any trouble pairing but the sound in the left earbud would always cut out on me.  I use these mostly when working out or playing golf, and with my phone in my pocket the music was cutting in and out.  The only time I would get clear audio was if I used them to watch Netflix on my computer.What I found out is that I had them in my ear wrong.  You have to put them in and turn them the way it shows in the directions that come with it.  Since I started doing this, I haven't had any problems.  My only gripe is that I wish the batteries would last more than 3.5 hours, but for the price I paid I'll live with it.  Really like them.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0

"This product has great sound, but there were certain downfalls that I believe are worth noting.  I purchased these earbuds to use while exercising in front of a TV.  I have a bluetooth transmitter connected to the TV to transmit audio, and found that the earbuds had a significant delay in the sound.  The audio did not align with the video.  After some research I found that it is because these earbuds do not support APTX Low Latency.  So, if you are purchasing for this reason....do not get these.  The second issue that I found was while walking and using the earbuds.  I had paired the headphones with my Samsung Galaxy S9+.  Everything was great until I put my phone in my left hand pants pocket.  Bluetooth connectivity was spotty at best.  Only when I moved the phone to my right hand pants pocket did the headset consistently connect with my phone.  I'm guessing that this is related to the pairing of the Right earbud only, to my phone.  At any rate, I returned these earbuds after encountering these problems, and purchased the Soundcore ANKER Liberty 2 earbuds, which eliminated all of the problems noted above, and has even better sound.",3,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
I bought these because they had really good reviews and the previous pods I bought were not very good quality.  I love the fact that the sound quality is really nice I am concerned if I were to lose them that they would end up being last forever because when they do fall out they do rollaway quite easily and on running trail they are pretty camouflage so if that’s a concern I would recommend a different color other than the gold tan which I have.I love the fact that the sound quality is really nice I am concerned if I were to lose them that they would end up being last forever because when they do fall out they do roll away quite easily and on a running trail they are pretty camouflage so if that’s a concern I would recommend a different color other than the gold tan which I have,5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0

I guess I have little ears, because the smallest size of silicone coverings aren't very comfortable for my small ear canals. I can't do a ton of movement like dancing with these or smile really big when I'm enjoying my aerobics work outs because when I smile they become loose and I have to adjust them again and again during my work out. Annoying. I'll probably upgrade or try a different model.

"So let me start by saying that the earphones are good, when they aren't failing you. The issue these earphones have is the sound. The sound continuously cuts off. It goes a little something like this, the sound is playing and when I apply pressure on a certain part of my phone the audio starts cutting off and when it comes back it comes back in a faded manner. I've had a similar kind of issue with other bluetooth earphones. My second problem is when I was using both earphones, it decided to pause therefore, I set one down in the charging slot, then when I tried using it again I had issues trying to get sound on the earphone that I put away. I imagine what solved it was leaving both in the charging box for a length of time.Besides all this the sound is good and does a good job of blocking sound from outside sources. I'm thinking of returning though I wouldn't like to deal with the annoying issues any further.",3,1,2019-2-28,1,1,0
I read tons of reviews on lots of wireless earbuds and thought that Tozo seemed legit. They are extremely big but I was willing to overlook it because the sound wasn’t bad. The phone calls WERE HORRIBLE though. Again thought about retuning but since I don't make tons of wireless phone calls I didn’t. They started being weird during charging. One charged but the other didn’t.  But then they stopped charging. That’s when I pulled them out and turned them over to discover they had burned through the connection! This could have ended tragically and started a fire out night in my house! I had them less than 6 months. I’ve had cheap ones from AliExpress $5 last longer! Don’t waste your money. Ridiculous that they have so many good reviews.,1,1,2020-9-26,1,0,1
"The WORST thing about these is the case it is HUGE! Just big in the pocket, and honestly it is a small complaint. Second worst thing is micro USB and USB C...oh well... I bought  these buds for 3 big reasons well 4...1. Wireless Charging, when I got them I just got a Samsung duel fast charging plate for my note 8. Now the weird thing is with them on the fast charging plate the case makes a high pitched squeal...now this maybe the fast charger being high powered but I don't  know...2. Reason is water proofing, I have showered with these and they work great can't say much about it 3. Reason was the fact is was Amazon recommended. And that small 4th reason is price...Audio quality is decent, I am no audiophile I mean I actually still listen  to 8-tracks and love it, so for my ears and the music  I listen to  they are decent. They work very well for videos, audio books, and podcasts. They are awesome for work, I wear them for tasks and projects. I guess bottom line is would I buy them again?...honestly  probably not  and that comes down to my personal choice  to hope to upgrade  to a more premium wireless ear bud. But, I won't do that UNTIL these mighty buds are fully dead. And that day will be a sad one. For sure I will be looking at more TOZO buds for my next pair and trust me for a budget  and starter pair of wireless buds these are totally worth it i can't  recommend them enough even with their small ""faults"" that lie in my personal tastes and opinions. I honestly  love them and super happy  with them.",5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
The overall sound quality and durability the fact that it is 100% waterproof all are top-notch factors that really make it hard to almost hate these things but I had no other choice but to move on to something else because these things are way too big and ugly and just look disturbing when in use I can't tell you how many comments I had the first day I wore them on how they look like radioactive hearing aids. when I looked into a mirror and saw that I did in fact look like a carcoming down the road with both doors open I realized that I made a purchase that I wasn't really pleased with other than that like I said the entire quality and functionality of the earbuds are wonderful. they just need to be dramatically reduced in size is the only thing. If only they were to be redesigned or updated and to something a little bit more discrete or a shape that was more contour to the inside of a human ear then we would be in good shape other than the shape of these things which are anything but good.,4,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"So I ordered these Bluetooth earphones And they were delivered July 6. I was out of town, so I didn’t get to get them out of the amazon hub until July 13. They worked really well. The battery lasts a decent amount of time, and the sound quality is very good. But for some reason when taking a call they worked really well the first two days. Now by day 4 I get constant complaints that the person on the other side of the call can’t hear or understand me at all. Not sure why that suddenly happened. I would hope that’s not everyone’s typical experience, but it’s mine and I feel I should share that.  It’s inconvenient and disappointing, but whatever. I’ll deal with it. I wouldn’t buy again or recommend to someone else.",1,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"I was skeptical as hell about trying these, since I had tried and returned nearly all the $200+ options on the market. But here’s my best breakdown:Sound Quality: Definitely comparable to the high end options, and better in some cases. I hated the low volume level of the Air Pods, even at full volume they were quite weak. But even the new $250 Beats earbuds sounded way too sparkly in the highs, with no mid or low range. But these are well balanced. And definitely the best volume of any wireless earbuds.",4,1,2019-7-6,1,0,0
"I love these little earbuds! They feel solidly built. I'm sure that if my 3 year old got a hold of them, it won't be the last day they live. They are rubber textured so they are not so ice cold when first touched. I do wish they had better sound isolation, but I feel that if the noise were to be completely cancelled, then I would NOT feel safe using them in public spaces for safety. Having earbuds that pair & connect so easily has helped with jumping on last min conference calls, switching to audio books, podcasts, or music.I also love the case they come in. It's like a portable power bank that stores a few charges for them - with a four LED  light power indicator to let you know when it is due for a charge. The earbuds snap into their case magnetically, and the door has a magnetic hold as well, so I'm confident that these little guys will stay put together and not be floating around in my bag in a mishap. There's also a black tether that comes with the package so that you can put your case on a lanyard. I did it anyway, but I think I'm going to change it to neon so I don't have to swim very far if I lose this guy on my bed or clothing.",5,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0

"The sound quality I think is great for the price. Not bad. Just couple inconveniences for me like not automatically connecting to my bluetooth phone when taken out of the case. One major thing that bothers me is that instead of a slight touch to pause/play music... you have to CLICK. And while the ear piece is in my ear, I have to press the button really hard for it to actually click and by the time it actually clicks... it digs into your ear and is slightly painful. So i have to hold the earpiece with my thumb and middle finger to try to press down hard enough w my index finger.Updated review: less thanb2 months have gone by and the earphones are already acting up. If you want to use only one earpiece... that one earpiece will beep every 2 secs trying to search for the other earpiece. So if you wanna use one piece. You have to pull both earpieces out of the case and leave one in your pocket or something.",1,1,2019-8-31,1,1,0

"Bought these Dec 2019 and am very please overall with the sound, noise cancelling and longevity with a full charge. You can’t go wrong for the price of these buds either with a great sound experience.I must comment on their customer service as well. I purchased the additional insurance for them and recently lost the right earbud. Not having the policy in front of me, I emailed Tozo asking how I can replace the one I lost. They informed me the policy did not cover loss but said they will send me a new one at no cost. That was great news to hear, so if you’re having doubts about purchasing these buds, know they have great, timely responsive customer service dept. I won’t hesitate to purchase these as gifts or buy again myself again if needed.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
UPDATE: I have now purchased two sets of these.  The sound and feel and ease are more than I ever hoped for.  I wear them almost every minute I'm at work.  I wear them so much that three other co workers have also now purchased them because they liked them so much more than their airpods and bulky over the ear headphones.  I can't rave enough about these.  Probably the best purchase ever on Amazon.I was ridiculously skeptical about these headphones when I ordered them. $50? I have $150 wired Bose in ear headphones that are starting to wear out. The wire was so annoying when trying to work at my desk and block out noise of my office. I had to get wireless.,5,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0
"The sound quality from this items is outstanding, and I'm a trained audio engineer with an excellent ear. They are virtually distortion free. The bass support is excellent for such a small item. The buds fit comfortably in your ear, especially with the supplied multiple size cups they give you for best fit. Just be careful if you purchase this item for making/taking phone calls. The noise cancellation is very good, but you hear yourself from inside your head (as when you plug your ears and talk) so speaking this way can make some people uncomfortable.I will add that the case that comes with this device, plus the overall packaging is very luxe and high tech; I love that! I use it with the Tozo wireless charger and love the futuristic, high quality look and feel. I recommend this item for those who want to listen to music and other sounds. Not necessarily the right item for long phone convo's.",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0

"I only just received my wireless earbuds yesterday. However, I'm in LOVE with them! I work remotely, so I'm in video conferences for multiple hours out of the day. Trying to use a set of regular, wired earphones with my laptop was getting in the way of typing, and were simply annoying. These have solved that problem. While simultaneously drowning out the background noise, I'm able to hear very clearly the sound coming out of the earbuds. In my off time, I love to have my iPad playing with my DVR'd shows, and these are absolutely perfect. My fiance isn't forced to compete with the sound from the iPad, and I get to do my thing without having to worry about not being able to hear clearly. Love, love, love these! They've fulfilled every expectation that I was hoping they'd fulfill. Aesthetically, they look sleek. I love the case that they came in, along with the lanyard that is optional to allow you to wear the case around your neck (at least I think that's what it is for 😁). I also love that they sent multiple ""nubs"" to help me find the perfect fit for the earbuds to sit snuggly in my ear without fear of falling out. I am very happy with my purchase, so far. Thank you!",5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
"These headphones have become part of my daily routine. I get up early in the morning to take a walk and start using them, then I wear them throughout the morning. After a walk, I don't have to worry about taking a quick shower with them in. Then I just putter around the house and do my normal routines with them in. The battery does seem to last a little more than three hours for me.The sound quality is great. It's important to make sure they fit properly for the best sound though. They have good base which makes the songs sound so good!",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"I normally don't write reviews.  These ear buds are very nice for the price.  I got them because I needed ones that had noise cancelling abilities.  The noise cancellation is great, I was able to hear my music while mowing the lawn.  I, also, got these ear buds because they were rated/reviewed for small ears.  However, they do have different size sleeves.  I was hopefully that the smallest sleeve would keep them from falling out of my ears like all the other ear buds I have tried.  But, that is not the case - the left ear falls out alot and constantly feels like its going to fall out.  I followed the instructions but it didn't matter.  It has gotten to the point, my left ear now aches.UPDATE- after trialing the ear buds with the small sleeves.  They don’t fit my ears as well as I original. They tend to want to fall out and I feel the need to replace them in ears.  I’m planning to return them.  I got them because when I search for ear buds for small ears this came up and the reviews were good.  Unfortunately, I must have very small ears.",3,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"These really work well for all the reasons posted many times by others (good sound, great case, battery, pairing, comfort, etc.). One important feature is that these do NOT beep constantly, in between every song or video, like some Bluetooth headphones and earbuds, and that is really important.But the bright blue LED that flashes periodically on each earbud while in use is a real problem if you are in a dark place, or listening at night. It lights up the whole room, and is blinding if you look right at to anyone nearby it their eyes are adjusted to the dark. What are people to do on dark airline flights? The person sitting next to you is going to murder you after 2 minutes of being blinded every 5 seconds. Your spouse is going to divorce you if you attempt to listen to stuff at night and the room keeps lighting up like the police are raiding the place.",5,1,2019-9-24,1,0,0
"I would have given 4.9 stars because first pair out of the box had an issues with connectivity, the left ear bud would drop sound for a second or two then function again for 10 -15 min then drop again.

"I absolutely love these earbuds! The sound quality isn’t perfect immediately, but with a bit of adjustment in my phone’s EQ settings, I have them working perfectly. Super easy to pair with my phone. Also very easy to switch between using one earbuds or both. Once you go through the initial setup, just pull the buds out of the charging box, wait a couple seconds, and they automatically connect. The controls seem simple - just tap a specific number of times to pick up/end calls, skip to next song. I usually use my phone for those controls, so I don’t have much input there. The noise cancellation seems superb compared to my beat up old apple earbuds. Appearance wise, these are sleek. Not cheap looking like some can be. The charging box is really nifty too! With a limited battery life, that really helps extend the length of use each day. The box has a battery indicator light, and the headphones do as well.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,1
"Not sure if it's just my product but the little charging case is complete garbage and is completely useless as a recharging system for the headphones.I use these headphones every time I go to the gym. I keep the headphones and case in the center console of my car. when I first got them I made sure that the case was fully charged so that it would charge my headphones after I used them at the gym. They get about 1-1.5 hrs of use every other day, so I assumed the case would keep them charged for basically a month's worth of use before the case would need to be recharged. After my first day of using them I put them back in the case to recharge and the case was at full charge. Two days later I got them out and the headphones were fully charged but the case was completely drained. I have tried recharging the case multiple times but it seems like as long as the headphones are in the case the case will be constantly draining. This completely defeats the purpose of having a charging case. It should only drain to the amount that the headphones need to be charged and should not constantly be draining. For a while there I was recharging the case every 3 days and only using the headphones about 3 hours in total.",3,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
"From what I can tell, the sound is pretty decent but they are way too big for me.  I used the smallest ear piece possible and it still was too big.  used it for walking around and had to repeatedly try and reinstall it in my right ear (left seemed ok).  These would be no good if I was trying to do anything more strenuous than walking as I feel like they would fall out (they fell out while walking).  Can't really comment on the noise cancelling aspect since they don't really fit in my ears.  For the record, I am a normal sized adult and have never had issues with ear buds or anything before.

"After owning these for several months, I still think they are a pretty good 'value' for $49.  I believe you can find similar ones for as low as $35-40.  You get what you pay for. The sound is good quality, they ear bud bateries last a few hours, and they pair well and don't drop the signal.  They are comfortable and stay secure in the ear if you're just hanging around  (I would not go running with them).  I can't comment on mic quality since I never used them for phone calls.  Downside - the case power does not last...maybe a day without recharging the ear buds...the charge just seems to fade (maybe the ear buds stay on in the case?).  I don't mean to sound vain, but they stick out of the ear like a couple of lopsided small bricks - I bought white ones (thinking that's the 'correct' color since apple airbuds are only white) and they look a bit silly...the black ones would probably look better.  Also, they don't have a lot of 'features' like an equalizer app, volume up/down, etc,  That can be frustrating and, in fact, I've ordered a higher end earbud set already (Jabra), and will donate these to a worthy cause...my son.",4,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
3 Stars for their effort to help with the issues I had.I purchased this originally and had issues with the buds after owning for about 2 months.

"During the workday I use the Tozo T-10 every day. Given the battery life is about four hours coupled with my need to have one ear free it works out great.....when one loses battery power, I simply swap ears and seamlessly giving me four more  hours.  I do not think it would be reasonable to ask more battery life out of the T-10 because of its size and very reasonable priceWhile the Apple Ibud Air noise cancelling wireless sound somewhat better I find that the T-10 s are a much better value given price vs quality. As for noise canceling, the T-10 doesn't claim to be. when music is playing I do not hear much external noise.....which is partly why I wear only one at a time when at work. The sound quality is comparable to the wired earbuds that came with my iPhone....possibly somewhat better. I would recommend the T-10 highly to anyone wanting a wireless, stemless, earbud with or without a neck harness  to anyone looking for sound quality at a reasonable price!",4,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"I had high hopes for these earbuds and they didn't quite reach my expectations. The color is exactly how they appear in the pictures and the sound quality wasn't too bad, but that's about all I liked about them. For some reason, a couple of days after using them, the sound started cutting out. It was very odd and even after a full day's charge, they kept doing it.Also, I didn't like the fact that since the right earbud is the master earbud, if you only want to listen to music with your left one, the right one has to be out of the charging case for it to work.

I would return them, but I want' to use them to swim laps with, so I bought better 3 tiered ear buds made for swimming to use with these. These simply will not stay put in my ear, my right one especially. The other thing that I feel is missing (probably due to the IPX8 rating), is that you can't skip songs on the ear buds themselves.

"The sound quality is great! As a consumer of audio purchases, I am very picky about what I purchase.  For this product, my first requirement is sound quality in which it easily meets and exceeds. The second is ease of use in which it is easy to connect to any of my Bluetooth devices. The great feature is that it automatically turns on and connects to your device once you take it out of your charging case and will automatically turn off when not in use or when you place back in charging case. Third is the comfort in placing in your ears. I usually use these for about 1 to 2 hours at a time and these don't make your ears sore like other ear buds and especially traditional headphones.  I have not gauged the life of the battery charge yet.  I've had this for about a week and a half and only charged these only once.

"I had ordered my first pair of TOZO T10 earbuds back in March 2020. Something seemed off as they charged almost instantaneously, but only held a charge for 30-40 minutes which wasn't long enough for my afternoon jogs. During running (or even walking) the earbuds constantly felt like they were slipping out of my ears and had to be adjusted constantly, the included range of earbud sizes didn't seem to help. They also had constant connection issues where the left earbud would just disconnect or refuse to connect to my phone in the first place. The sound quality was good, but for the other reasons, which made the earbuds almost unusable, I had left a bad review.TOZO support contacted me and said they would be able to send me an updated pair (the T6s) or I could get my $40 back in the form of a gift card (I hadn't paid with paypal, but they could send it back that way, I had used my amazon wallet balance I believe). I chose to accept the T6s and they arrived maybe a week later (I was in Alaska at the time, so I wasn't able to get them until I returned to Washington as I only had my campus PO box in Alaska and they couldn't ship to a PO box).",5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0

They do a great job at filtering out external sounds. And while putting them through the testing phase the battery life has proven good. The sound does not become choppy and they do not drop signal and then require full recharge after only 2.5-3 hours of use.The test phase is not yet complete with me and the earbuds, but to date, and for the price, they have performed well and as desired.",5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
I have had these for over a week with daily usage at the gym. I am an avid runner so I typically have headphones in for about 80 minutes. I cannot for the life of me get these to stay in properly. I have even purchased after market foam ear bud covers as the sizes that came are not sufficient. This makes for an awful end user experience where near constant adjustment is needed.

I originally bought a set for my wife to use during gym workouts. She liked the fit and sound. She said they worked well on the treadmill. After my wife told me this I switched from my old wired buds that I use for yard work to these TOZO wireless earbuds. I use them for working on our farm. I have used them for mowing and while using my weed eater. I love the noise cancellation while I’m mowing because I can barely hear my mower while music is playing. I’ve used these while using my chainsaw under my normal earmuff hearing protection. These earbuds work well during all usage conditions so far. I bought the first set for myself about a month ago and so far so good. I bought a third pair for office use. These buds are a great bargain for the sound and fit. I read reviews that said the left earbud cuts out intermittently. I have not experienced this problem.

"Overall I like them.  True wireless buds are an essential item for my life.  I've had a few pair of others, and these seem a little harder to keep in my ear.  They're a little bulky.  I also wish they didn't flash blue every few seconds because that draws unwanted attention.  But they sound good, and aren't expensive, and the case allows you to charge them on the go.  The battery charge lasts about as long as all my other pairs.  I wish the case wasn't so bulky, because it a little to big to carry around in my front pocket.  I usually just keep it in my truck and put the buds in my pocket.  They should provide a separate carrying case to protect the buds that's not so bulky that you can put them in when you're at the gym or something and don't want to wear them.  Because you're definityly not putting that giant case in your shorts pocket.",3,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"Having finally upgraded my ancient iPhone 5C to an XR, I decided to try and reduce the number of 3.5mm headphone jacks in my life as well.

(And honestly, I'm not a huge fan of those squishy things stuffed in my ears anyway after over-ear cans for my listening needs.)  So I'm returning because they don't work for me.

"I purchased the Tozo T10 because of the overwhelming positive ratings.  I thought they were priced right.  A number of reviews indicated they were ""too loud"" and the advertisement said they had booming bass.  I opened the package and was impressed.  They looked great.  Only problem was the sound.  They were hollow sounding and I had problems with the volume inexplicably going up and down.  There was little bass.  And worst of all, they weren't loud, which is made worse since the volume isn't adjustable.  The songs I love and know how they should sound were virtually unrecognizable.  I did feel the audio separation was good and with more volume they might sound ok.  I decided to try out the cheaper MPow M30 and they are great.  The bass is good, the volume is adjustable.

After a little over a month, my left earbud stopped linking up with the right one. I searched here and on-line for suggestions and tried several different methods, including the manufacturer reset technique, to get them to start syncing up again but it never worked. Also, when the system voice plays back telling you that the earbud is powering on or off or trying to connect, the voice plays at a slower speed making it sound like the left earbud is drunk.

So far the size options work well and will fit a variety of inner ear sizes, and I am able to hear clearly with them at low volume. It also cancels out outside noise very well and it's easy to pull one out if I need to hear something speaking to me. The only complaint I have with this product is the battery life. I believe the description says the battery life lasts up to 13 hours, but I'm lucky if they last 5. I charge them per instructions and am not sure why they drain so quickly. Overall though I am satisfied with these bluetooth earbuds and do not plan to get anything else.UPDATE DECEMBER 2019: while I still like these overall, the battery quality is pretty terrible.

"I tried a few of these more reasonably priced wireless earbuds before landing on the TOZO 10's. While I haven't had them very long, the initial impression is great! I would suggest following their recommendation to try ALL of the various-sized ear pieces to ensure you have the best fit. I liked the fit and feel of the original mounted size, until I tried the smallest set. The sound went up a notch as they settled into the proper position within the ear and the noise cancellation became great. Even at a low volume I have to take a bud out to hear someone talking 3' away...impressive. I can't wait to use these on my next flight.Pros:",5,1,2019-7-11,1,0,0
"-One button for everything. Each bud has it's own button though they perform same operations. Auto power-on from charge case or 5 second hold, power-off(3sec hold) play/pause(one click), answer/end call(one click), reject call(2sec hold). RESET is 10sec hold on both buds at same time. *i put this at the top in case ppl use it for reference*5 stars if I wasn't required to write this review to complete my warranty. I like to have a product for about a year before I write a review. I've had these for 3 days at this point. I've used them alot and here's what I've got:",4,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
"I've only had these a few days, but I have to say I'm absolutely blown away. I've been getting sick of my traditional usb-c headphones as I'm an avid bodybuilder and the cable is often a problem; between needing to keep my phone nearby, catching it during runs/lifts, etc.I spent a good amount of time comparing these to competitors, to higher end brands (ones in the $150+ range, etc.) and made the plunge with these. For $50 they offer basically the latest features that even name brands struggle to match.",5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0
"When I received these ear buds, it appeared to have some clarity issue or possibly be defective. The quality of the sound was degraded. After working with the seller, they sent a replacement set and the new ones are wonderful!..huge difference in sound, much clearer and crisp, bass is just right, and fit is snug. Turns out I may have received a defective item initially and the seller was genuinely concerned with my satisfaction that they stepped up to correct the problem. Definitely a good buy and a great product.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,1,0
"I cant believe these have 30k ratings and its at a 4.5 out of 5?. They simply do not stay in my ears. I tried everything to get them to fit. The design of these Earpods are dumb founding. They dont latch onto your ear in any way to keep them from just falling to the ground. I dont get it. Am I missing something? Sent them right back and bought a pair that actually ""Fit"" and conform in your ear. And dont fall out. The ones with a piece of rubber that conforms to your ear and holds it in. As for sound I didnt really get to test them fully but but they just sounded ok to me. Cant recommend these to anyone, the design is simply flawed.",2,1,2020-1-25,1,1,0
"I have had these earbuds for a couple months and they are great. The battery of each bud lasts close to 3 hours between charging and the case holds at least 2 full charges. I like being able to use just one ear bud individually and they synch to my phone and to each other with no issues. Although they are labeled “left” and “right”, they are the same shape so I can use each in the same ear and switch them out to charge. Sound quality is about what you would expect with wireless earbuds, it’s good but it doesn’t knock your socks off. It could be how they sit in my specific ear, but they do not drown out surrounding noise as much as I would like. Overall a great purchase for the price, would definitely recommend!",5,1,2019-3-24,1,1,0
"So far, I have had no issues with this item. The earbuds paired with each other and my phone very easily and the sound quality seems to be comparable with the mid range corded headphones that I normally use while exercising. I did have to change the earbuds for one of the included smaller sizes to fit well but this was not an overwhelming issue. I have, to date, not had the opportunity to test this product with an actual telephone call since I normally utilize them early in the morning just for exercising.The headphones fit into the case which appears to be able to utilize either a cord or wireless charger. I also appreciate the excellent manufacturer followup, contacting me to insure that I was satisfied with the product.",4,1,2019-2-19,1,1,0
"I got these headphones for my husband. I saw all the reviews and had high expectations. My husband has had these for two weeks and can't stop raving about how great they are! Such a good price too. They stay in his ear, even on rough runs. My husband said the only thing he noticed was that if he turns his head quickly to the left the opposite head phone cuts out for a second? He only noticed this when he's running. Other than that he loves them, so I'm happy. =)",5,1,2020-6-20,1,1,0
"Ok, I've had these for a few days, and the sound quality is good, and they fit well.  ""But"" as this is my 1st experience with earbuds maybe my expectations are a little high, the sound is constantly dropping out and coming back.  Now i'd expect this if i was more than a few feet or a  meter or 2 away from my phone, but literally my phone is in my pocket and my sound drops.  Now I've gone for walks and just around my house, many feet or meters away from things, just to make sure that nothing was interfering with them.  But my results are always the same.  If I don't find a way to adjust this, I will be sending back. Maybe i just got the one bad apple in the manufacturing process, but overall the packaging and the quality feels fine, and sound like I said earlier is nice with good bass and all, but if it constantly cuts out what good is it.",3,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
Before I purchased these earbuds from Tozo I was satisfied to go old school and use my wired earphones. I thought I'd give these a try and I have been extremely happy with them. The two main factors that drew me to try these were the price and the 8mm diaphragm. I've been a musician all my life and I do some home studio recording so I am pretty critical when it comes to sound quality. I was truly surprised at the quality of detail these have. Listening to tracks I've listened to a thousand times I could hear details in the music that I'd never heard before. The sound overall is well balanced. Some manufacturers tend to boost the bass which may be fine for some but I prefer to hear sound the way it was recorded. Even delicate high frequency's came through clearly. The build quality is excellent. Overall design is beautifully elegant. If I had a need to I would definitely buy these again.,5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,1
"I received the earbuds quickly.  They were packaged well with clear instructions on how to use them.  It was odd that how to wear them received the most attention, but they don't ""just fit"" into your ear - you need to press and angle them just so.  Once it, they felt comfortable, but they felt like they were leaning out just a bit.  I have not jogged with them in so I don't know how well they stay put.Unfortunately, mine would not stay connected.  I had audio dropping issues with my phone and on my computer.  I completed the warrantee registration and noted my complaint.  They immediately reached out to make the situation right.  I will look to the next pair to see if they stay connected better.",5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"I was originally looking for Skull Candy wireless earbuds because I like my wired earbuds, but their wireless buds have mixed reviews. Came across these, they had really good reviews, and they were on sale!These things are amazing! Pairing up is a piece of cake and they sound awesome. With my volume turned up a little over halfway these put out a really nice level of sound with plenty of bass. Crank these things up to eleven and it feels like the room is shaking. These buds are way louder than my Skull Candy earbuds. There is maybe a tiny bit of distortion at the high end, but that’s only on music that really abuses the high end.",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"Push button that needs enough force to deflower your ear canal.Doesn't stay in ears.  Mine fall out from normal use.  Not sure if it is because they are badly designed, or my auditory passage was overly...violated.",4,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
These headphones are great value for money. I was skeptical about wireless headphones at this price but they were recommended to me by a friend. As a cyclist who often finds his headphone cable to either get in the way or be too short these were a game changer.They are very comfortable. They cancel noise pretty well although I have only used them for exercising so I can’t speak to air travel just yet. They have great volume and the controls seem to be good too.,5,1,2019-11-20,1,1,0
"Airpods who? Any of the apple ear buds never fit my ears so I have a collection of them from all the phones over the years. I didn't want to pay $200 for an ear bud that would fall out constantly and I found Tozo on Amazon. For the price, everything is superbly made. The fit, finish and feel of the case (magnetically snaps shut), the ear buds (gold ones, doesn't look cheap) and the sound is more than enough for my intended use (during activities). Plus, its stated to be IPX8 waterproof so should be sufficient to withstand sweat and when I take it skiing. I immediately changed the rubber ear surround to the largest one and it fit like a glove. If I happen to lose it, no biggie because I'll just pick up another pair. Very happy with this purchase!",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"I have bought, tried, and returned upwards of 8 pairs of bluetooth wireless earphones because anything under 50 bucks truly lacks in bass and overall sound quality. On top of that, good luck finding a pair that are also comfortable and don't weigh your ears down.These little puppies went above and beyond for me. They fit in my ears PERFECTLY and I don't feel scared they may fall out nor are they heavy. The battery life is great so far and sound is amazing especially when you consider the price range. I've had them a bit over a month now and love love love them.",5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"***UPDATED REVIEW***After my first review, the company contacted me immediately. They were concerned about the issue I had, so I assumed. They offered to send me an “updated” version of the earbuds If I edited my review, which leads me to believe that they may just be trying to buy my review. So... this “Updated Review” is actually a review on the TOZO T6 Bluetooth earbuds.",4,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"I was really hopeful for these, but unfortunately they are not working out. I purchased them in February, and I can no longer use them properly. For several days, the buds have been stuck in individual pairing mode—I can only use 1 or the other. I have tried countless times to reset them, but to no avail. I had the previous model of these earbuds that I loooved and used until they completely died, but these have definitely fallen short. I am going to go with a completely different brand from now on.",2,1,2020-8-7,1,1,0
The sound is good and they pair nicely. I like them except for they fall out.They fall out sitting at my desk. I'm using the smallest ear piece and still can't keep them in. It doesn't matter how I put them in.  The smallest one are making my ears sore.  I'm still trying to figure out how to get them to stay in.,2,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
I just received these new ear buds and have been testing them out. Once I had the volume turned up people had no trouble hearing me on a phone call. The activation buttons on the buds don’t require allot of pressure to press. It came nearly fully charged so after tipping them off I was ready to go. I’d give noice cancellation and battery life a 5 as well but I haven’t had them long enough to know for sure so my rating is based upon them delivering on all of their product assertions so far. These are an outstanding value. They paired right away and my iPhone 11 immediately saw them and connected. I took a shower with them playing music and they played without a hitch. I’m about a week I to using them now and I had to lower my review to 3 stars. The left bud is cutting in and out while connected. I’m not sure what the reason is so I’ve asked for a replacement. Stay tuned.,3,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0
"My wife wanted earbuds for her smart phone and my friend at work has a set of the Tozo T10 bluetooth earbuds and recommended them to us.  Based on his recommendation and how happy he is with them we purchased a set for my wife.  They paired smoothly with her phone and the sound quality is delightful.  She does however need smaller ear caps then even the smallest provided with the earbuds so we contacted Tozo and they replied almost instantly with willingness to send an even small set.  The product is great and the customer service even better.  My wife is happy and so am I.  Regards, Ken",5,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
"Pretty amazing considering the price. Con: The clarity of the sound is very good but midrange is NOT excellent. So for me the sound is just above decent. I have NO other experience in wireless earbuds so I have nothing to compare them to. However compared to full size headphones you will wonder where the voices and midrange weight went. So obviously not for serious musical listening.Pros: But I do not think that’s what these were designed for. These are for size, portability, and wireless convenience. In those areas they are excellent. The range away from the phone (source) device was astonishing. The fit and comfort was also excellent. They are also well designed with gear connectivity, battery life, overall build quality and packaging. For the price and what they were designed for I can’t believe it gets much better.",5,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0
"As a runner, cyclist, gym-goer, and walker, I wanted non-wired bluetooth earbuds that would allow me to listen to music on the go (as opposed to making phone calls). In that regard, the Tozo T10-R's are pretty much the worst possible option.  Let's start with the fact that, no matter which of the different earbud sizes I tried, the earbuds quickly and nearly immediately fell out of my ears, over and over. I finally began coating them with sticky hair gel before every workout (good work around but annoying). Even worse, the earbuds have no controls for music volume or changing songs. So if you are running, or riding your bike, or lifting weights, you have to stop whatever you are doing and fish your phone out of your pocket to make any adjustments. Ridiculous. I regret spending $50 on the Tozo T10's and will eventually ditch them once I save up for some new earbuds.",1,1,2019-7-31,1,1,0
"These wireless headphones are amazing!  I bought them on Amazon earlier this Christmas season with the hopes that they would be unobtrusive and would feel comfortable in my ears while providing excellent sound for when I am walking around without anything to do in my retirement and they are everything I wanted and more!  First, the ability to sync with my iPhone was incredibly easy, especially important for a man like me who lacks a lot of technological intellect.  Second, the case is charging the buds when you put them in.  They fit comfortably in my ears, much better than anything designed by the makers of said iPhone.  The sound quality is superb.  The music is loud and clear and it cancels out the outside world when I want to just be to myself and destress.  An awesome buy for a good price. Pick it up here at Amazon!",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,1
"I purchased these because, yet again, I left my wired earbuds w/ wireless dongle at home. I have a one mile walk from the parking lot for a part of my job that I get to do once a month and so I finally had enough of leaving my earbuds at home.  I immediately hopped on Amazon and was planning on ordering a cheap set of wired Bluetooth earbuds to keep in my vehicle but saw these instead.  I decided on these because as a pool owner, I figured if I accidentally dropped them in the pool,w/ the ipx8 rating, they should be fine.  I received them in 2 days w/prime and read the pairing directions 3 times (I've had issues with pairing other items in the past) it turns out I could have  read the directions once and would have still paired them right as they connected quickly and easily.  After picking the right size earbuds, they come w/ 4, I tried them on and couldn't believe how great the sound was.  I couldn't hear my husband snoring at all.  The bass was deep but not over powering.  These really allow you to immerse yourself in the music.  So thrilled I decided on these.  They've become my go to set.  Extra bonus, they include a 1 year warranty with registration.",5,1,2019-8-30,1,1,0
"The second pair the company sent are awesome! My daughter has had no issues, and loves using them. Call quality is great on both ends, and music quality is great. The customer service has been great, they reached out, and sent out a better pair, and have been patient with me updating my review. If you have an issue contact the seller. I deducted 1 star because just because of the hassle of the first pair since they were a gift.Worst earbuds ever. My daughter only got maybe a week's use out of these before they went kaput.",4,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0

My only complaint is the battery life and how suddenly it alerts you and only with minutes left until it turns off.

"I just purchased these AirPods on on Dec. 2 they were delivered by Dec. 4th! They are AWESOME! I am like some of the other people, that reviews these, I can’t fit most headphones/earbuds in my ears; these have 4 different sizes to choose from with some many ways to show you how to put them in your ears from written instructions to short videos, that it really made it easy! Also, the sound is excellent I love ALL kinds of music, I played every thing from Panic at the Disco! to, R&B to nature sounds like calming rain/thunderstorms and beach waves everything sounds EXCELLENT!They were super easy to pair! Super easy to charge! Super easy to place calls and have pretty decent reception, I could hear just fine and everyone could hear me just fine!  Easy to control settings although I will say *my* pair aren’t “touch” control more like “push” control. I believe the directions say you can “tap” them for certain things, mine don’t seem to work with a “tap”, but other than that...they seem to be everything they say they are!",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"I do aquatic exercise. I want music (or workout instructions) as I workout. I've had a few waterproof music players - for various reasons they just don't work out (stop talking to the computer to be able to switch music, not great sound quality, cumbersome to use, etc).So I've been searching for a blue tooth earbud (or even headphone) that was  waterproof - something that I can put my phone in a waterproof case and play music or podcasts or books or whatever.",5,1,2019-4-9,1,0,0
Shockingly disappointed in these. Had so many great reviews but after having worn them twice- I’ll probably never wear them again. Work okay in the ear when you’re dry and not really moving but even when I was putting on my makeup I had to readjust them a couple of times. Then I got home from work and decided to put them on in the shower bc they’re waterproof and I’m pretty sure the ear piece tried to suck my tympanic membrane out of my ear canal. Yes these are waterproof. No they do not stay in your ear when wet and if you try to push them back in while wet it creates a suction cup (that only lasts a second and then they fall out again) to your ear canal and it hurts horribly. So no I don’t recommend these to anyone and I should have just spent the money and gotten AirPods,1,1,2019-9-14,1,1,0
"Just got these today & so far so good. Took a little bit to pair to my phone but once I figured it out, I had no problem. I took the right bud & paired it to the phone then put it back in its case. I took them both out & the right paired to the phone & the left paired to the right. Sounds quality is amazing (love a great bass) & it cancels out sound well. I was reading that some people didn’t think the sound was loud enough but I don’t have any issue with this.Also worth noting that the buds themselves are pretty big & stick out of my ear but I also have small ears. The smallest ear attachment worked for me but comes with four different sizes to choose from. I don’t think it would be an issue when using for working out, etc. Highly recommend all around & definitely great for the price!",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"I like these headphones as they have a good sound quality and considering the price, this is a really good buy.  The battery case is a bit on the large size but it does seem to be able to hook up to a wireless charging stating which is a nice improvement over a lot of other charging cases that only have a cable option as those can wear out pretty easily.  The only other downside of these earbuds, and it's more personal preference, are that they don't have physical buttons or any kind of hepatic feedback, I like feeling the click when I press the earbud so I know it's being pushed.  Overall however great sound quality and they are waterproof so no need to worry about that breaking them.",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
I have Sony noise canceling headphones 🎧 and these I think are better. I love the Phaiser headphones sold here on amazon for half the price. The Phaisers battery lasts longer for sure but these sound better and no annoying head wrap. I use the Phaiser strictly for heavy  fitness activity. I skateboard and gym lift akd aerobics exercise with these and they stay in perfect. I did swap the regular tips for foam since I buy foam tips in bulk and prefer to gross feeling silicone ones. The foam combo makes these super noise canceling even better than the Sony who supposedly lead the pack in noise cancellation. The bass is batter than the Phaisers and the highs are very clear and sound great. I have tried many other wireless headphones over the years that range in price from $19 to $300 and I can honestly say that these are the absolute overall best value and best sound quality and best in ear wireless headphones.,5,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0
"Two must-have wireless earbud features for me are wireless charging and a robust waterproof rating. These buds fit the bill, and at a very reasonable price. I use these every day during my workout and I've never had a problem with them falling out. I also wear them in the shower and so far the waterproofing has held up. I'm a big fan of wireless charging for my phone (saves wear on the USB port and is just easier) so I wanted earbuds I could charge wirelessly as well. There aren't many at any price that offer these two features so this one was an easy purchase for me. The sound quality is good, not as good as a premium pair but it's just fine for podcasts or music while on the go. The build quality is good and service has been great. I did have a faulty unit but when I contacted the seller they immediately sent out a replacement and I haven't had any problems since. I have two minor suggestions: the case is kind of bulky, I'd like to see something slimmer that fits in a pocket, and I'd like to see a USB-C charging port. But these are minor quibble given the price point. Overall I can recommend the Tozo T10 to anyone looking for a reasonably priced alternative to Apple, Sony, etc.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0

These earbuds are fantastic.  Excellent sound quality even during phone calls...blocks out all other sounds so you are totally immersed in your music.  They are so small and comfortable I can use them inside my motorcycle helmet.  Very sexy and high tech ...they charge right in their little protective case.  Love em! 💘  I'm gonna buy another pair for my husband.  The sound quality is so good I bet we can call each other and talk while riding motorcycles.  Can't wait to give it a try.  Either way.

I love the wireless AirPods Ad would recommend purchasing them especially for this price. They come four different size ear caps.

"I was extremely impressed by sound quality of these earbuds. They’re quite loud and provide clear sound. Have very little bass but that’s expected, not a very big deal for me. The reason for my three star review is that the mic quality is EXTREMELY poor. You can hear the person quite clear on the earbuds but they cannot hear you. It sounds as if you were far away and there is static in the background. This is also expected for this price range, but since this is a huge component for me I’ll have to return them. If you’ll be using these strictly for music then they are totally worth it. Another reason for my three stars is because these earbuds were way too big. They do come 4 ear caps but not even the smallest sized fit. They are very easy to pair and you can use one earbud at a time. The downside is that once you start using only one earbud is that you’ll hear a beeping but eventually stops.",3,1,2019-9-22,1,0,1
"These are great true wireless ear buds for the price. It takes a little getting used to. They need to be wedged into your ears well, but stay in place during workouts.

I guess “You get what you pay for” sum up the product. I didn’t expect Apple AirPods or anything but these are just meh. It’s easy to use and connect. The problem I have is battery life. I listen to music and audiobooks and I these headphones last no longer than half an hour on a full charge. My generic headphones I got from Amazon last way longer.

I bought these so I could listen to music while doing yard work or working around the house. Sadly after a couple of weeks I notice when I moved around or bent down the sound cut out about 80% of the time. This is unacceptable especially given the price. I've gone back to using wired ear buds.  There seems to be no way to return them after a couple of weeks. Buyer beware.  Buying electronics that aren't name brand is a big risk on amazon. I've really started to reduce my Amazon purchases to items that are either highly durable by design or items that come with a good manufacturer warranty. Amazon is not like a Target or Costco where you can return something to the store if it is defective.,1,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0

"I've purchased many wireless earbuds/headphones from Amazon. I dislike wireless earbuds that have a wire connecting the them, so I tend to lean towards earbuds. These earbuds caught my eye because of it's IPX8 feature. As I have lose many due to rain or just stupidity, I decided to give these a try. I bought these and immediately tested them out in a shower (since they even advertise that). Expecting them to be like most earbuds that claim to be water-resistant, I braced for the worst. To my  surprise, they survived. This already has been a big plus. I haven't tested them underwater, but that will be the next step. The sound quality is is as good as you'll get without spending hundreds of dollars on other earbuds. The battery life is about standard to most earbuds on the market now. Speaking on that, another surprising feature is that the case can be charged wirelessly. In this day and age, wireless charging is becoming more prominent, and this feature just made this more convenient. More to come and will update in a few months.",5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"I like these earbuds a lot!  They sound great and they're not challenging to use.  The downside is they don't always seem to stay in and when I  put them back in the charging case they don't disconnect from whichever device I'm using.  I can have the right one in and the left one in the case and the left one is still playing, which I found out when my family complained about it.  Not sure how to make that stop yet.  The only other disappointing thing about these earbuds is that the picture made them look as if they had a little bit of sparkle in the black plastic...but when I got them they are just plain.  So, a little unhappy about them not coming as they appeared to be.  Overall, pretty happy with these.",4,1,2020-6-20,1,1,0
"Update: so in less than three months, the right ear bud will no longer connect to my phone. Was really enjoying them up until then. I took very good care of them, so it has nothing to do with that. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!So far these earbuds work great and for the money have very good sound. The bass isn’t overbearing but it is enough for me, being someone who loves a little kick in the bass department. Noise canceling is great as long as they are fitted properly and seated in your ear. The battery life is really great in my opinion compared to previous Bluetooth earbuds I have owned. I found that I got between 6-7 1 hour work outs on a fully charged case. My only complaint is you can’t skip songs on these. I had another brand of wireless buds that would allow me to skip tracks. That is a major benefit if you are doing some form of exercising and can’t really pull your phone out. It would be so much quicker to reach up and double click ear bud.",1,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0
"I decided to look for a Bluetooth headset after getting tired of holding my phone to my ear all the time.  So, I went to Amazon and began my search.  What caught my attention with the TOZO T10 Bluetooth earbuds is the nearly 9,000 reviews and over 75% 5 stars it had.  After reading about the quality and sound of these earbuds and the cheap price compared to other known brands, I decided to buy them and give 'em a try.  After receiving them the next day, I was presently surprised at how they looked. The charging case is small and solidly made.  After charging it maybe 10 minutes, I was easily able to sync it with my Google Pixel 2 phone.  Since I read that the quality of sound was amazing, I played my first song and was amazed indeed at the quality.  The sound of clarity and bass were smooth with what ever song I played.  I love the fact that you can charge the case itself and in return, it will charge your earbuds.  The call quality is clear as well and I also like the different options the earbuds give you when a call comes in i.e. accept the call, end the call, and call back the previous call.  All and all, I highly recommend this product, you will not be disappointed and for the price...you can't go wrong.",5,1,2019-8-23,1,0,1
Not perfect but very convenient. My wife says these have probably saved our marriage. The only real problem I have isn't with the headphones but more with the technology. These can connect to an unintended device and you'll be left trying to figure out which device that is. Can be quite frustrating when EVERYTHING is Bluetooth capable now. You have to run around turning devices off until the problem is solved. Perhaps there is a solution to this or a way to mitigate it. My wife is thankful to TOZO for providing a product that gives her peace and quiet. I am thankful for the cost savings vs. divorce attorneys. Thank you TOZO. In all seriousness these are nice. It does have a problem with sound cutting out from time to time but this could be a problem with our Apple TV device. I did not knock any stars because I do not know where the problem lies. I have no experience with any other BlueTooth wireless headphones.,5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"Bought for my husband a truck driver that cannot hold a phone when moving. They work but the SOUND is horrible when I do call him. It sounds like he’s inside a metal box and very staticky!  Trying to see how to return them. Very disappointed in the sound quality. Also, no extra ear pad covers in the box.!!! I don’t know how these got their high reviews because we can’t give them one! I’ve got to contact seller about returning these. Sorry🤣",1,1,2020-8-2,1,1,0
"All of the sudden, and without warning, the left earbud wouldn't pair with the right earbud.  After only 5 months of owning them, and with inconsistent performance, I would not recommend these.-Tried every video and suggestion to get them to re-pair, nothing worked.",1,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"Construction seems solid. Sound quality is good. I like that R/L labels are large and easy to see on outside. Buttons push easily without harming your ear, but not easy enough that an accidental brush triggers them which is a problem I have had with other ear buds. Earbuds are multiple sizes and comfortable.Cons",5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"I've been using these earbuds for about a week now. I couldn't be happier with them. Yes, I've had some headphones with SLIGHTLY better sound. And, I've had some headphones with better active noise cancelling. But, those are over-the-ear headphones. For what I use them for (exercising), these earbuds are all-but perfect. They are very comfortable. If the book I'm listening to quits, I'll forget I'm wearing them. They're that comfortable. And, they fit very securely. No matter how much I'm sweating, or how I'm holding my head, they stay put. I particularly like that there is no wire to get caught as I move my arms or change positions on a weight machine. No, the noise cancelation isn't perfect. But, I don't want silence. I want to be able to hear SOME traffic noise -- I just don't want that noise to interfere with my music (or whatever).",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"The Tozo T10 is very well made and quite impressive for the price. The packaging was well executed, and it comes with very nice features such as IPX8 waterproofing, Wireless charging, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. Take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing. With bluetooth v5.0 they have a stronger connection at a longer distance. The highs have very good clarity clarity and the bass is very rich. The ability to use the T10 for a little over four hours and then a charging case good for four full recharges of the earbuds is very nice. I have tried two other brands, both quite good, but the T10 are significantly more comfortable, and the sound quality is better overall. If you have a hearing deficit you can use the right earbud to aid in phone conversations. These are very nice earbuds, the price is great, and I will be using them often in place of my wired earbuds.",5,1,2019-8-8,1,0,0
"You'd think for 50 bucks, they would be as effective as Congress. NOPE, they work magnificent, if they worked any better they would have to change the name to the PERFECT $50 EARBUDS that is better than Congress.  I have paid off a small home loan in all of the ear buds I have purchased over the years, so far they are amazing, 3/4 volume on my phones, and I cannot hear anything but my playlist. I dont even hear the dentist drilling my teeth. (TRUE) After 3 needles full of Novocaine I didnt feel it either.

"My husband runs a fair distance each week, and he loves these headphones.  They fit well, help to cancel the noise, and have good sound quality.  We did run into an issue with them about 6 months into use, however.  One would pair with his phone and the other wouldn't.  We ran through all the troubleshooting and still couldn't get one earbud to pair.  I contacted the company directly and they replaced them for free.  I am really satisfied with their service.  I would definitely buy these again!",4,1,2020-7-27,1,1,0
"I was looking for wireless earbuds to try and not go broke in the process. I took a chance on these and I love them!I had trouble with my  ears being too small since every other product that I tried was too large and heavy that they would just fall out of my ears. These come with several sizes and the small one really did the trick for me. They stayed in my ears even after a 40 minute treadmill run! I have not showered/swam with them on, but I don't think I will ever do, so I can't confirm if they are truly waterproof. I picked the white case so as not to lose them in my black gym bag.",5,1,2019-7-30,1,2,1
"UPDATED:  I don't know why the T6 I received to replace my T10 is WAY BETTER!  It must have been defective because the experience I have during the past couple weeks prove these are the earbuds I've been seeking.  As previously mentioned, sound quality and noise cancelling abilities are excellent.  One cool feature I admire is the ability to use one earbud at a time in either ear and still connect to device and/or automatically connect and sync the second earbud at a later time.  It also has touch controls for music and voice which is always impressive.  But what's even more impressive, and in my opinion for the high rating, is Tozo's customer service.  They took the time to reach out to make certain I was satisfied with their products and resolved my issues.  I sincerely appreciate their great customer service, professionalism, and products.  Nicely done Tozo!",5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
"I really love these, they fit well, stay in and have a great sound quality. My only issue is the left one cuts in and out. My husband has a pair and his does the same thing. I have read that its a common issue with this set. It doesn't stay out more than a few seconds at a time but it can really be annoying when you're listening to a podcast or audio other than music. I still use them everyday because they are so great. Sound great on the phone as well. Others say they can hear me clearer than without.",4,1,2020-4-22,1,1,0
"The Tozo T10 earbuds are high quality earbuds at a very reasonable price. The sound quality is rich and the bass is full, much better than my previous earbuds.

"They sound incredible! The bass is deep and they fit perfect. Absolutely super easy to pair. All you literally have to do is take them out of the case and they'll immediately go into pairing mode. You just gotta open your bluetooth tab on your phone and tap on 'TOZO R' on the list of found devices and you're done!The case lid is also magnetic, so it makes opening & closing the case really smooth and convenient. No worrying about anything breaking or getting worn out, because there's no latch to keep it closed. The magnets keep the case closed.",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
These waterproof Bluetooth headphones are awesome!!!! I take them to the pool with me to drown out the sound of ill behaved children! Also good when you want to do a few tedious laps for a workout. These work very well and I did a submersion test in a glass of water to prove they’d hold up... no issues! The carrying case is amazing! You can charge the case and then it becomes the charger for your buds so you can charge them on the go! Case remains charged for a while before a recharge is needed. Perfect for someone who forgets to charge all their devices like me. And I love how you can charge them on the go! These are cheap considering function and quality! Gosh I love them! Yes they are a bit clunky and hard to squeeze into some ears but as long as you don’t do HIIT with them should be fine. And if you do HIIT I’d recommend just holding them in with a sweatband! They do water sports like they are intended to but might be clunky for running. I absolutely love these headphones and thank them for existing!!!!,5,1,2019-4-14,1,0,0
"Edit: I made the below review on March 10, 2020. Call it the curse of the year 2020 or call these bad ear buds. Either way, they’re not good anymore. I feel that if these are going to be the same price as the official Apple wired headphones, then they should at least last a quarter as long as them. I’ve had the same Apple wired headphones for 3 years and they’re still going strong. These wireless earbuds lasted 3 months before they started going haywire. After 4 months, the left one completely stopped working. After 5 months, the right one has to be turned to full volume just to hear anything. I’m now in month 6 (yes, I’m trying to hang on till the bitter end) and the right one now connects only about half the time. I’ve followed all the directions for when one fails from the manufacturers page. First off the fact that they need to put those instructions up front is crazy. I’ve never dropped them. They’ve stayed completely dry. The case charge used to last 4 days. Now I’m lucky if I get 2 full days.So all in all....changed my review to a 1-star. Anyone want to suggest some good wireless earbuds that last but don’t cost hundreds of dollars??",1,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0
"If u like your music loud this is the ones for ya. At first I had a problem w connecting them to my laptop, only 1 will connect. But that's ok for me actually I prefer the ability to have one ear open so that's a super plus for me. I bought these mainly to use with my phone while working out anyways. On my phone (OnePlus 6T) is connects both ear pieces. I usually just put my left one in the charger & keep my right one on, unless I want to zone the world out. Noise cancelling is pretty perfect, especially since the volume on the media playing is so loud it mutes everything else out. As far as phone quality, it does pick up a bit of background noise, nothing too unmanageable. I really like the cord it comes with making it portable.",5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"Update: Customer service was very responsive to the battery issue I was experiencing. The replacement case does seem to hold a charge longer than the previous one. I would definitely recommend these earbuds.These earbuds are fine if you get them on sale, but they're not worth full price. They connect well and the sound quality is quite good. They are not very ergonomic, sticking all the way out of your ears and only contacting by the tips. And the battery life of the case is very poor, closer to 300mAh than the 600mAh advertised. My set was replaced and I'll update my review if there is an improvement in battery life.",4,1,2019-7-9,1,1,0
"I travel a lot and I'm on a lot of meetings that I need to call into. These headphones work great for both. I'm always a little skeptical with reviews, but these little gems are great. Sound quality is great, they're easy to set up, and surprisingly. The mic works really well. I've had no complaints on my business meetings that I sound muffled or can't be heard, which is fantastic.The battery life of the fully charged earbuds is roughly 3 hours, which covers me for most flights I'm on. This is great for flights that I don't get my own personal screen, so I can just pair these with my Surface or iPhone. Once my headphones run out of juice, I just pop them into the case to be charges again. It's great because if the case is charged. I don't have to worry about plugging anything in.",5,1,2019-9-27,1,0,0
"Bought 2 pairs of this item, one for me and one for my gf. My pair worked great for the first day and so did hers! BUT after that we both ran into the same issues so it can be a product defect. It's that the products weren't made correctly. My microphone didn't work and had people trouble hearing me on the phone after a week. So DON'T BUY for the headset function as people will not be able to hear you speak when you're on a call!! Also, after 1.5 months the earbud that you touch (by scratching your ear or pressing the pause button) stops working so the sounds cuts in and out! Also, case stopped holding charge after 3 months and you have to manually connect the headphones to your phone if you accidentally pull the earbuds out of the case before turning on the bluetooth on your phone. The sounds quality is decent, but you can get the same quality from $20 headphones. Do not buy if you're interested in a headset or working headphones. Noise cancellation is great though.",1,1,2019-11-13,1,1,0
"I rarely leave reviews but for $50? Best damn ear buds I've ever used. I haven't had the need to root my Samsung Galaxy Note 9 since I got the phone — one of the only reasons I would have was if the sound quality was poor. But it's not, it's fantastic. The right-channel ear bud will always lose battery faster because it's the one connected to the phone and the other ear bud at the same time. Your phone is sending the signal to the right-channel which then syncs with the left channel and thus stereo sound. In this process, it has to use more battery life. So get over it people. But I will say that 1.5 hours, give or take, is a long time to have ear buds in at a volume that is detrimental to your health so at 50%, it lasts closer to 2.5 hours.",4,1,2019-4-30,1,1,1
"This is my first foray into wireless headphones of any kind. I'm still playing with the fit, but that's not why I didn't give this a 5 star. Why I didn't give this a 5 star is because I tried calling a few people and they all said I sounded like I was talking from underwater.I've been using these since I got them earlier in the day and have had no issues with unpairing or fading in/out. Sound is okay. I noticed it sounded tinny at first but I seemed to have got used to it or I just don't know wtf I'm talking about.",4,1,2020-5-30,1,1,0
"Taking my 5 star down to 3 star due to them saying it’s waterproof but it’s NOT. Went into the pool for less than 10 seconds and dies. Don’t claim their waterproof when my died from getting water on them. Love these works perfectly when doing sports, they stay in the ear very well. The battery life has lasted me over 6 hours of consistent use! The only weird thing I find about it is the way they charge. You connect them into the case but the case dies very fast without being plugged into an outlet. So the earbuds have good battery life but the case does not. The connection to both of them at first is difficult to figure out but after a few uses it gets fairly easy. Overall very impressed with the sound quality and battery life.",3,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0

They stay in my ears, although this has not been an issue for me with other earbuds. I run outside and get sweaty, and have not had any problems with them staying put.The sound quality is very good; clean and crisp, and the rubber covers block out significantly more ambient noise than the Apples.  I often wear earbuds all day, and after many hours, I have one ear that may become a little sore from the pressure of the buds, but that's after a lot of hours.",5,1,2019-9-15,1,0,0
"This is the second set of wireless earbuds that I have purchased and the first from this company.The first thing that I noticed was the sturdy ness of the case. The case is solid, protecting the earbuds. My previous set were docked in a case with no lid and I kept them in my truck. If I had to stop suddenly and the case would shift from where I had it the earbuds would come out of the case and I would find myself search for them on the floor of the truck.",5,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"The sound on them isn't horrible, it is just ok, the problem is it is so loud most of the time, even if I turn it down as far as I can without muting it. the reason I gave noise cancellation a 3 was because of the volume I don't put the buds all the way in my ear. Full disclosure, I'm almost completely deaf in my right ear, so the loud sound is great there, I can actually almost hear in stereo. However, my left ear has excellent hearing so I only partially put that bud in to keep the sound to a livable level, this means I get little to no noise cancellation, I'm not sure if it is really good or really bad, so went in the middle.My biggest issue with these is the crappy battery life. You can only use the buds for 2.5 hours that is fine when I'm working out, but I like to wear them at work, there is very little point, because I have to charge them for an hour every 2.5 hours.",2,1,2020-3-10,1,0,1
"I bought these to use while I'm running.  The actual ear pieces pair wonderfully to each other and to my phone and I was really excited.  The sound quality for music is excellent and phone calls (mic) is relatively decent.  The biggest problem I had with these is that they constantly fell out of my ears.  To be clear,  if I was moving at all (running/walking/ect) they had no chance of staying in place.  i had to search on the ground too many times for them to even be worth anything to me.  And I did try the different ear piece fittings under ""active conditions"" and it made no difference for meI actually got so fed up I was going to throw them away  and chalk it up to a failed experiment but daughter hijacked them with the last new ""earpiece"" fittings and she likes them well enough.",1,1,2019-7-1,1,0,0
"Sounds decent enough. I like how you have to physically press the button on the earbuds to do action. The touch ones I always accidentally press. Buttons have limited functionality compared to other earbuds though. Voice is crystal clear, but doesn't have any noise cancellation, so even a TV in the background comes through extremely loud.I would recommend if you mostly just wanna listen to whatever, but terrible for phone calls unless you're in a quiet room, then they'll be great",3,1,2020-6-10,1,1,0
"Only had these for 2 days but so far they seem great. Charged quickly on a wireless pad, held charge through 5+ episodes of Star Trek Discovery (a sixth one after a short charge in case) and no issues with connectivity on iPhone 8+ (was very easy). The earbuds themselves and the case seem like a very high quality build. Not what I expected from sub-$50 bt earbuds. Day 2 saw them in use during my old man workout (lots of stretching, ball exercises, sit ups, and 30 minutes on elliptical) which they passed with flying colors. Comfortable, no issues with them moving around during workout. Something I haven't mentioned is they have very very nice sound to them - not the best i've ever heard, but definitely not a disappointment by any means! From blasting Papa Roach, Skillet and New Years Day during workout to listening to sci-fi  special effects - again, the T10 IPX8 earbuds passed with flying colors.

Update to original post: The company reached out with an option to replace my earbuds and I accepted.  The new pair of T6 earbuds are great! The quickly pair with one another and so far there is no crackle or loss of signal or sound. I am very happy with the new pair and am very impressed with their customer service.  I would recommend these earbuds for anyone. They are very easy to use.The left earbud will not stay connected and when it is it crackles. I have tried everything! When they both work they are great! But 9 times out of 10 the left will not connect/stay coveted or just cuts out.  I’m just not happy with the product.

"These are perfect. No issues with sound cutting out at all with my Samsung Note 8 android. The sound is fantastic. Bass is great, balance is excellent.  Easy to pair up, works right out of the box. Best part is there are 4 different ear buds sizes you can try for a snug fit that wont fall out. Just got these, but so far I love them. Well worth the money. I got the Khaki color. Its nice. Feminine almost like an accessory. No one asked me to give 5 stars. This us my true review.

"After rolling through several reviews of the best budget earbuds out today and seeing the Tozo T10 prominently featured I decided to roll the dice and all I can say is... wow. For this price point, you will be hard-pressed to find a better out of the box bass delivery system. I have always used large tips for my earbuds but the added X-large tips take it up a notch. The sound is clean with punchy bass verging on thunderous depending on the fit/size of the ear tip. A snug fit is key to experiencing the full force of these little beauties. I am currently using memory foam tips that take the bass to that aforementioned ""thunderous"" level. Rage Against the Machine was finally able to rock on 2 small earbuds as heavy as they ever have on my home stereo. If bass is your thing, you just found paradise. And it's made out of memory foam.Call quality seems to be good with the mic doing a decent job. I have had no complaints during calls. The lack of media controls is a bummer but pause, play, & redial suits the basic needs of the average person. Make no mistake, the sound is what drives people to the Tozo T10s. That's the reason I came and ultimately stayed. Any Bass-heads out there need to take a serious look at Tozo T10s when it's time to get new affordable buds. The bang for your buck on the T10s is fantastic.  Great Sound, Great Bass, Great price.",5,1,2019-9-19,1,0,1
"Let me start by saying this- I am a critical listener and I am very hard on headphones. I use them primarily for working out, where I sweat all over them, then take them to the sauna afterwards. I have been through several pairs over the years, and not one pair satisfied me. I started with the Motorola S9 about 16 years ago. Went through five pairs of those. I worked for Harman where I got anything below cost so had several pairs from JBL, Harman/Kardon, Infinity, and AKG.When I got these I was sick of the cord between the buds, so these were my first true ear buds. I didn’t expect much and I waited a month and a half before writing a review. I gotta say, the sound rivals my AKG Herbie Hancock edition headphones. They actually fit and create a good seal so the bass is awesome. Controlled, smooth, and undistorted. Mods are nice and detailed and the highs are not harsh and forced like most earbuds sound.",5,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"Purchased these after I bought a new phone and I am very pleased with the quality. After finding the right size ear pieces and sound quality is fantastic! Mid-level volume is sufficient to block out most ambient noise, but I can still hear conversation at lower volumes. They are comfortable to wear for several hours at a time. The batteries hold a charge for 5-6 hours of continuous play and can be shut off when not in use to preserve the charge for longer throughout the day. The microphone appears to be of good quality for phone calls as well. Overall a great pair of earbuds for daily use.Editing to add that due to my own carelessness I lost the right earbud!

The battery and charging mechanism appeared to work great too. But 15 minutes into any meeting, I lost the audio capability. Could not hear. I would have to take them out, put them in the charger, wait 30 seconds and put them back on. This isn't suitable in the telework situations most of us are in these days.

I work in loud warehouse, a job that requires a lot of moving so anything wired has a chance of being caught and ripped out of my ear. After an evening with these guys, theyre not really what i thought theyd be like. The bass is subpar (i get bettwe base from the skul brand you find at walgreens), in order to block out most of the warehouse sound i have to turn my volume up passed the halfway mark by then the sounds arent even and very sharp (even a bass dominated song isnt really bassy more on the sharp side that gives you a headache). Im not a fan with how much they stick out of your ears, i get that currently on the market a lot of wireless earbuds will stick out but this pair REALLY sticks out. I tried increasing the size of earplug and that kind of helped but not by much. They will also connect and disconnect at random moments, even if my phone is a foot from the pods. For the money i spent, im not too satisfied.",3,1,2019-7-8,1,0,0
"I was surprised by these headphones.  I was not expecting them to have as much bass as they have.  the overall sound quality was great for this type of head phone.  It is hard to compete with true over the entire ear headphones.  I have used them in the shower and they performed great.  If you put them in correctly, they stay in my ear.My kids have the apple Bluetooth headphones.  they do sound better or at least more what I am used to.  The one main thing missing with these is the mid to high range sounds.  The sound difference is not worth $100 though.  I have over the ear head phones if I am just sitting around listening to a concert.",4,1,2020-5-11,1,1,0
"These headphones are not worth the money. The sound and fit were very good but the bluetooth signal is so weak and unstable that if you move your head, cover one of the earbuds or even chew with them in, they cut out. Doing anything physical in them is impossible. Unlike lower priced models, they cannot operate with just a single bud in. They must both be connected, otherwise the left earbud beeps constantly, like a bird sadly calling out for its lost brother. I bought these on a recommendation of a coworker, who has since experienced the exact same issues. They just aren’t very good.",1,1,2019-10-7,1,1,0
"I bought these for the purpose of using them while doing workout/yoga vidoes on my tablet. Pairing them was a little challenging, but once I got the hang of it, I could switch between using them on my tablet, laptop, and phone easily enough. Sound quality seemed okay but not terrific. There would be a lot of bass for some songs that I wouldn't consider to have heavy bass normally. The connection would lag every once in a while, and sometimes the audio between the left and right ear would be out of sync. Oddly enough, none of these were deal breakers.The thing that was the deal breaker is that they wouldn't stay in my ears. I used them to watch movies on my laptop, and they stayed in, though I did have to occasionally push them back in as they would eventually loosen. This wasn't horribly inconvenient. It was horribly inconvenient though when they would fall out of my ears during workouts. I'm not talking about high interval training, jumping around workouts. I'm talking about little movement, staying in place, planking types of workouts. It's super frustrating to be holding a side plank and have an ear bud fall out. They wouldn't stay in for yoga either. I can't imagine going for a run with them.",2,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"Wow!! I was thoroughly impressed! Normally I stray away from ear buds like this because of the simple fact that my ear canals just don’t hold them most of the time. My biggest annoyance at the gym is having to constantly adjust ear buds or cords, and now my worries are gone. The sound quality alone blew me away, and normally I like my music full blast. I can’t turn them up all the way otherwise they would be too loud! They are comfortable, sleek, and the noise cancellation is excellent. I find myself getting surprised at people entering through my personal bubble, and I used to work in maximum security prisons. It is so satisfying to put them away in an actual case at the end of the day, and the way they magnetically clasp in is awesome. I am sold for life. Welcome to the future.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"I will start with the good.  The case is small and is easily carried in even my smallest purse.  I usually have trouble with earbuds due to my ear canals being very small.  This comes with different size buds and the smallest one worked for me.  They are light weight and feel comfortable in my ears.  I don't run in my every day life so I am clueless if they would stay in for that but for walking and doing housework they remained secure.  Pairing with the phone or computer was super easy and quick.  All this was great but the battery life is terrible.  I use them generally for 1.5-2 hours and put them back in the case but the next day they have not recharged and are dead.  So, the case needs to be charged after each use.",3,1,2019-2-15,1,1,0
"I use these for my phone as it does not have a headphone jack. I enjoy these headphones because they do not fall out of my headphones like most other wireless ones. The sound quality is pretty good, with a decent amount of bass considering the size. I typically do not use the headphones for long periods of time so I cannot attest to the battery life, but under normal consumption it does the job just fine. The case feels very sturdy, and is a little bulky, however I am perfectly fine with that. It does not open freely, so you have a low chance of your headphones falling out. The dock inside the charger secures the headphones in place securely. The case as a whole, seems sturdy enough to survive a fall at a decent height and not break and open. It also has a hook to you can attach a clip, which I do appreciate. If you are looking for good headphones for this price point I believe this is your match.",5,1,2020-6-13,1,0,1
"This is the 3rd set of different brands that I've bought for use at work, and while the battery life on these is longer than others i've used, the fit just can't seem to be right for my ear, due to the larger outside size of the earpieces. I tried the different tips provided but out of all of the earbuds I've used, these are the only ones that tend to fall out easily. And, they are also quite a bit more noticeable, so if that matters to you then you may want to try smaller ones. I prefer the boltune, both the sound quality is better, the fit is easy, and i've never had them fall out unless i was eating something with them in. Roughly the same price. I'd return these if i hadn't already tossed the packaging.",3,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"Very good earbuds for this price point!!! The second I took them out of the charging case the synced with each other, my cellphone found the Bluetooth signal and I was using them!! I like that the volume control is on my cellphone because past earbuds with onboard volume control would fall out when I tried to adjust the volume. These are sturdy, well made earbuds and the charging case is not only closed magnetically, but it’s see through so you can see the blue charge level lights and the earbuds lights through the lid. I’ve gotten almost five full charges from the case before I had to recharge it. I’m very glad I purchased these earbuds.",5,1,2019-6-16,1,1,0
"So this is based on only two uses so far.... First use, I was noticing this weird clicking in and out of the sound-very brief skips. I figured it was because I was out in my yard and slipping in and out of WiFi coverage. Next day, out for a run, nowhere near my house... Same thing. I tried turning off call audio, didn't work. Accidentally realized, then, that moving my phone from my left arm to my right arm totally fixed it (or putting the right ear bud in my left ear and vice versa). Can only guess that since the right his is primary and the left bud is the slave that lefty is interfering with righty? Overall tho, sound quality is pretty decent and they actually stayed in my ear without any fidgeting for the entire room. Minus the weird quirk, I'm satisfied so far. For the price, I think they're decent.UPDATE: after reading my previous review, they contacted me via email and think I may have received a defective pair. They immediately sent me a replacement. Have not been able to test them out yet, but the customer service had been excellent.",5,1,2019-6-5,1,0,0
"These aren't terrible, but I do have a few issues.  They paired perfectly with my iPhone.  They paired with my Mac book, but the sound only lasts a couple of seconds until it goes silent.  I tried re-pairing, re-starting.....nothing worked.  The biggest problem I have is the fact that they keep coming out of my ears.  They also hurt my ears pretty bad after just a little while of wearing them.  I'm assuming I must have small ears or something so if you have small ears, don't buy these unless you're ok purchasing different ear tips.  That's another thing.  The customer service was really good.  I didn't want to return them if I could avoid it so they sent me a link to the smaller tips (link below).  I was charged for the tips and charged for shipping, but am being reimbursed for both once they ship.Smaller tips:",4,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"THIS IS AN ENTHUSIASTICALLY WRITTEN POSITIVE REVIEW!Usually when Amazon or a seller asks me for a review about an item I purchased, I tend to accommodate them even if my opinion was less than stellar. I'll tell the truth about my likes and dislikes so that others could make a more informed decision about the item.",5,1,2019-7-11,1,0,1
"Really great, very comfortable set of headphones that stay in place, even with seemingly lots of jostling. Almost comfortable enough to sleep in. They aren't much for noise cancellation- but they aren't meant to be. They way they are put in and fit is quite clever. I immediately appreciated how cushy they were. My husband is completely unable to wear AirPods, they simply won't stay in his ears. These do. The battery life is what it is. But the case is an amazing charger and only takes 20-30 min to go from flat dead to a full charge and you're rolling again. If you just simply drop them in the case every now and then throughout the day, they last quite easily. I bought these over AirPods for myself and I'm glad that I did, 10/10 would buy again. And now having used both... I think I can fairly say this is the better purchase.",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
It's a great product for the right ear size. Unfortunately they would not hold in my ears well. Especially when starting to sweat.  I had tried the T12 first and returned them because I had the same problem plus I never knew which one was the right side or the left unless they were charging. These have a R and L which is great. I did keep these but I am still on the look out for a pair that will fit me better. It's annoying when they keep falling out of your ear even that you follow the guidelines how to put them in. I use them outside while doing yard work. I couldn't imagine running with them. They would fall out real fast! The sound is great though.,3,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
Update: customer service isbworking to correct the defective earphones.Well lets just say i can only use the right one. The left continues to pair in and out dropping the signal repeatedly. Its terrible. The left earpieces is so bad i refused to even wear it anymore. They dont stay in if your a runner. Not a chance. Best for mopping the floor or washing dishes. Not for the gym.  Trust me. Spend a little extra and get a quality pair.,4,1,2020-1-7,1,2,0
"These earbuds are exceptional.  I did alot of research looking for a solid, comfortable, easy to use and affordable pair of earbuds.  These had many great reviews so I had to try them - so glad I did!  I love them!The sound quality is outstanding.  They can block out all background noise.  I loved that they can be loud enough to vacuum the house or mow the lawn while I could still hear my podcasts.  Sometimes I wear just one and it allows me to still keep an ear on my kids while enjoying my sounds.",5,1,2020-4-9,1,1,0
DO NOT BUY THESE!! I literally ordered these to be here for tomorrow because I needed them for a specific event and they arrive and they literally do not work from the get-go! The right ear bud is supposed to be the one that pairs with your phone and it literally does not work at all like it’s supposed to! I followEd the directions as easy as they were and the right earbud does not even remotely connect to my phone! I’m super pissed off and buying this was a huge mistake! Now I am without Bluetooth headphones for tomorrow and is it entirely because this product sucks!!!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!!! If I could get this product zero stars I would!,1,1,2020-5-30,1,1,0
"I love this set. It's my third kind of true wireless I've purchased/used, and so far my favorite. (last one was a jabra elite sport).Pairing is a breeze.",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"*** Update ***So after about a month, i decided to return them. Mainly the reason is that one of them does not stay in my ear and i have to push it very hard in order to be in place which results in muffing the sound. i tried the smallest cup but with no luck.",4,1,2019-7-8,1,0,0
"For all the things that really matter, this product is better than the T-6.The sound is better, they fit better, the bass is better, the overall volume is better, and the ear buds personally look better to me.",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"For the price, I was surprised at how great these are. Good highs and mods, and great base. But the base is completely dependent on the fit, in your ear. If they aren't tight, base won't be as deep. Otherwise, they sound fantastic. No sound bleed that others can detect, decent noise canceling. I bought my wife a pair for her birthday and after trying them, bought myself a pair. In my day to day use, I've never had a problem with battery life. I've never worn them for more than 2 hours at a time though. Call quality is sub par, but that is not why I bought them. If my wife is using them and calls me, I can hear her but it sounds like she's in a large hall, not a focused sound. But usable. Any major background noise though, and you can tell. It breaks down the quality.In summation, they are great for videos and music, but I don't rely on them for calls. Although in a pinch, they will work fine.",5,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"I lost my pair of Apple AirPods while I was away on vacation, which were a gift, and I couldn't warrant spending another $150 on a pair of earbuds. I did a lot of research online and I came across these TOZO earbuds. I was a little skeptical at first, but when they arrived I started by getting the right fit for the rubber inserts in my ear. After reading the manual and understanding how to position the earbuds properly I was surprised by the sound quality and noise cancellation for the price. The battery life has been great. I have been not only listening to music but also taking business calls using these earbuds. There are been no issues at all. Take the time to fit the earbuds in your ear properly to get the best sound. These are definitely worth the $35 price...and I also was able to avoid spending almost 5x that on Apple AirPods. Great product and I would definitely recommend them.--- UPDATE March 15, 2020 ---",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"I loved the sound better than any wired set of earbuds.  The noise cancelation is great, riding my motorcycle now sounds like the interior of a car.  Putting the helmet on requires a bit of flexing of the helmet to get it over the earbuds.  Some have posted about the buds especially the left bud cutting in and out.  I have had this happen too and it seems to be a transmission/reception issue.  In my home the buds do not cut out but if I walk outside, place the top of my phone on my left hip, the sound fully cuts off. My home has layers of brick and metal, radio signal bounce off it so I have to use an external antenna. The Bluetooth signal is trapped in the house so I get great coverage indoors.  Outdoors it is a different story, body parts can block the signal, holding the phone flat and facing you gives a perfect signal.  This issue becomes a feature if you're like me and forget to take your phone with you.  At home, no interruptions, at the gym, I start to walk off, turn away and it cuts out for a second I turn back, pick up my phone and water bottle and NEVER forget my phone!I am impressed with the engineering on the TOZO T10, it works great in the shower, phone use is clear and crisp, well worth the price!",4,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0
"Right off the bat: I got a pair of these delivered, they would work for an hour or so and then I'd have major signal issues.  Left ear would cut out, right ear, the whole thing.  This ONLY occurs when I am moving and can sometimes be mitigated by not having my phone in my pocket.  That said,I worked with an Amazon rep to walk through a bunch of solutions and nothing worked.  They sent a replacement pair and I had the exact same problem.All of that said, there is a very good chance that the problem is with my phone, a Pixel 2.  If you have a P2 or P2XL, you will remember that there were many issues at launch with Bluetooth connectivity.  I genuinely believe it is a compatibility issue.  I will say that I tried almost every configuration of settings I could (AVRCP versions, Bluetooth Audio Codecs, Sample rates, etc) and wasn't able to find any particular setup that would mitigate the problem. Also, I had a pair of BeatsX (that died prematurely, do NOT buy them) that never had any kind of signal issue like this.  I've also had other devices that worked great (fitness trackers, Bluetooth speakers) and did not have an issue with any of them.",4,1,2019-6-4,1,0,0
"I don't know if I just have smaller-than-average ear canals, but I've found that I can't use the rubber covers on these ear buds. Even the smallest ones are too big and cause them to fall out of my ears. Thus, I leave them off and just have the bare buds in my ears, which affects the noise cancellation and sound quality somewhat. Also, if you're using these outside while talking on the food, they are very sensitive to wind and other ambient noise. The person on the other end will not be able to hear you even if there is a mild breeze blowing. That being said, I can hear things very well and have enjoyed them! The battery holds charge well, as do the earbuds. All in all, I am pleased with the purchase in spite of the setbacks.",4,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"I have bought several BT earbuds from different companies and gave out for gifts.  After trying them they did not compare to the TOZO 10 that are in this price range.  When buying I try to get the best quality in a middle price range so I'm not paying the extra money for the ""Hype"" or ""Newness"" of a product.  Plus it gives others the opportunity to find out if the product is good or bad.  The TOZO 10 after several days has performed flawlessly, with very good sound and at the right price.  Not much else I can say, only time will tell if durable, but TOZO is known for backing up their product with a 1 year warranty.  When dealing with something small and prone to dropping, that is very important.  Take care and remember Music Makes Life Better....",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"While I can see the obvious difference in the sound quality as compared to a similar couple hundred dollar item, I would say that these earbuds are the best quality for the price. I used them also for running, but since the smallest size is still a bit too big for my ears, I have to use a head band to cover my years and make sure they don't fall. Nevertheless, they seem to be the perfect fit for my boyfriend, so maybe take into account the size in case you are a woman with smaller ears. On the other hand, the battery life is pretty good, I believe one charge held me for about 3 hours. The earbuds charge pretty fast, maybe up to half an hour the most, but the external battery takes some time to charge fully, especially if you use a laptop or another intermediary device. It connected very fast to everything I have tried it so far, TV, android devices, fitbit watch. Very good, recomment it!",5,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"i’ll be really honest here, i’ve gone through a lot of headphones... expensive wired ones, and wireless ones but never ones like these that are TOTALLY wireless. the noise canceling and the base is phenomenal. BUY THIS NOW! If you have arthritis like my 68 year old pops they aren't really for you, the buds are small and can easily be dropped if not fitted in ears correctly, they do give a string you can use to tie them together if you are really worried but the buds that came on them work perfect for me.but if you want some awesome quality headphones for working out/biking this right here is the way to go! I got the Khaki color ones and the best looking ones because it kind of blends in with every skin tone. waterproof with an 18 month warranty too so it’s like yea do it now bruhhhh",5,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
"These are my first Bluetooth earphones and I am impressed. Buying these made me realize I have small shallow ear canals so the adjustable + different sized tips are very convenient. The buds stick out a little bit (not flush with my ears) but they are still very comfortable and don’t fall out.I mainly use one at a time while I’m at work and 1 bud will last me 4-5 hours then I put it to charge and grab my other bud and I found this works perfect for me. I have also used these while jumping rope and they stayed in! The noise cancelling is very good as well, sometimes I have to ask my co-workers to repeat themselves when I only have one bud in lol",5,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
"It can be a bit overwhelming looking at all the different options for wireless headphones, especially when there still isn't really a standard for what people are looking for. But rest assured that these are of a very high quality and far worth the price.Immediately out of the box these feel like a quality product. The build quality feels solid and the earbuds fit comfortably in my ears. I was able to wear these for over an hour and never had any kind of ear strain. The storage case is nice and bulky, making it harder to lose, and closes tight with a magnetic clamp. It feels solid enough to be dropped from an average height and take no damage. There is also an LED indicator light to show you when your headphones are charging or at full battery.",5,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0
"These are good earbuds. I’ve been using them for 2+ months. After trying two different sizes of the silicone plug, they fit well( and there were plenty of sizes included). They stay in pretty well, the only time they have popped out is when I’m taking a shirt or sweater off.  I also bought a slightly less expensive (Xiker-no longer available in that name but the same as True Wireless Earbuds) brand that has a smaller war bud and case and has a better battery life, but doesn't  sound as good as these. I’ve been impressed with the connection quality and the distance from my phone.  That is also better on these than the less expensive brand.I’d look at the slightly more expensive Tozo T6. It has the smaller sleeker design than this pair.",4,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"Great quality sound (you may have to adjust the equalizer on whatever device you link these to in order to get the best quality sound from them) and great noise cancellation! I listen to a morning radio show for about 3 hours and they last most of the show before telling me they need to be recharged, but I got them for going to the gym and there's no way in hell I'd work out for 3 hours, so it's fine lol.The only downside is the 'finish' on the white ones. Not sure about other the other available colors, but the matte finish on these white ones started to rub off after about 2 months of daily use. No big deal, as this has no effect on the functionality of the earbuds, but they get dirty/dingy-looking. I *DO* wipe them down with a small rubbing alcohol pad after each use, so maybe that's what does it... either way, I don't care. These buds are awesome!",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,1
"AWESOME sound quality..the R ear did pair faster than the L ear...brought 2 ...one for the hubby and myself, black and white. Found that was a similar occurrence...the sound quality and clarity when making a phone call is amazing. The call sound better than when just speaking on the phone. I just received my pair...so can't really speak on the battery life...but my hubby says it has great battery life and didn't need to charged during the day and he uses his faithfully to take all his calls and watch videos etc. I also like the fact that you can use only one airbud at a time and the sound quality isn't affected. Overall we are truly pleased with this purchase and the price is AMAZING!!!! We both have a Samsung 9 edge. As to the fit..it is a bit bulky but sits very well in the ear. We both had to downsize to a smaller ear piece and did so with very little difficulty.",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"The first several months I had these I only used them in the gym. They’re comfortable and have solid (but not over the top) sound quality. I used them there in the steam room and the jacuzzi after workouts so they really are waterproof. The only disappointment is that since I’ve been on lockdown now I’ve had the opportunity to use them for longer stretches than a workout and I’ve discovered that you don’t get a full four hours of battery life. Initially I was getting about three and a half, but now it’s under three. That’s frustrating when your watching something and suddenly it starts telling you to charge. But you can put them I the case and charge them again without needing an outlet so that’s a plus.",3,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"First off these sound very good. Not like Movie theater good but for someone that is under a 1/2 inch wide and thick very good.I use them when on my motorcycle. I haven't fully tested battery life start to finish, but I would say less than the 3.5 hours provided. The other concern I have for the battery is that when charging wirelessly on my Samsung wireless charger (haven't checked wired) that it never sends a fully charge signal to the charger leaving it to possibly over charge.",4,1,2019-7-14,1,0,0
"For the price, these are hard to beat. I have two pair of TWS JBL earbuds and I prefer these everytime. I use them daily for working out. My brother let me borrow his and I had to buy a pair for myself. My JBLs are collecting dust now. I will probably sell my JBLs and buy another pair of these.Sound quality is on par with the JBLs I have. While the sound stage is not quite as good, don't let that deter you. These work great for working out, however, as a runner, I have switched out the earpieces for some foam ear pieces from another brand. I think it makes them sound a bit better to be honest. It would be great if they provided foam ear pieces, but that is just getting really lucky at this point. Get a pair for yourself!",5,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
"I bought these specifically for listening to audio on my phone and to make calls while freeing up my hands. The sound quality is great, short of fantastic! Phone calls sound great and listeners claim they can hear me very well! The device does sync multiple devices but only one can be used at any time, disconnect one and connect to the other device.The only draw back is the audio/video sync is off, there is a very noticeable delay when watching videos. I tried it on both Windows and Linux, the delays is there on both. Luckily on Linux, I can adjust the latency by ""-10.0"" using PAVControl, see  attached pics. Now audio/video is perfectly synced. On Windows, I could not find a way to do the same.",4,1,2020-5-24,1,0,1
"Got these on sale and with a 10% coupon. Overall, love these. Wonderful sound quality and they can get really loud. They sound great when taking a phone call. Love how thely recharge in the case and have great battery life. The only knock is they only pair up with the right ear bud and the left connects off of that one, so you can listen to one at a time but only the right one. Otherwise the moment I pull the right one out of the case, it links right away. Love these especially for the price!",5,1,2020-4-19,1,2,0
"They’re too loud. Entirely too loud.Adjusted the volume on my phone to the lowest volume and they are still too loud. I wish there was a way to adjust the volume on the earbuds too. I bought these to listen to one of those rain sound apps while I sleep to block out any outside noise, and while they fit comfortably, and are easy to charge, they’re just too loud to utilize. As someone who has anxiety fueled sensory issues, I can’t say I’ll be getting a lot of use out of these. They’d probably be great for someone to use at the gym or anywhere where it’s loud, but if you’re looking for something to listen to an audiobook on or anything calming, these probably won’t work for you. Really bummed because I like they way they fit and it’s hard to find earbuds that are wireless and not huge.",4,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"Wowzers... for the price, I’m absolutely blown away by these headphones. They were so easy to set up and the sound is awesome! The case is a little bulkier than my husband’s comparable headphones, but I don’t think his are waterproof.These are a major upgrade over my corded “wireless” JBL headphones and the difference in the range is remarkable. I couldn’t walk down the hall in my house without the other ones cutting out and breaking up, but these allowed me to leave my phone in my kitchen and walk all the way out to my garage with the door closed behind me and I still had clear, perfect sound. Wireless charging worked like a breeze too.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
The two earbuds will occasionally go out of sync.  It will play audio in just one ear intermittently and is very distracting and sometime disorienting.  I tried unpairing and pairing them again but it didn't solve the problem.  It happens both with my phone and with my computer.Ear buds are actually rather large and protrude past my ears.  This means that they are not comfortable to use laying on my side.  The earbuds mostly stays in my ear while running on the treadmill.  I occasionally feel them coming loose (maybe because they stick out so much) and can push them back in before they fall out.  I haven't had them fall completely out yet.  I've tried the different sizes of ear pieces but none prevent them from getting loose.,3,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"These earbuds are complete garbage. I ordered the first pair due to the reviews, the package was decent and they seemed pretty good. I paired them up and they seemed to work well for about 3 hours. Then the left earbud seemed to disconnect and reconnect randomly. I thought this was due to the battery, so i charged them fully. This made the issue worse. It started to cut out even more often. It got to the point where I could not move at all without the left side cutting out. I asked for an exchange thinking I received a bad pair. I got the 2nd pair. Same issue. Decided to get a refund and try a different brand. Save your time and money and go with something else.",1,1,2020-5-9,1,1,0
"Seems a little laggy on response. When my phone makes noise (system sound) there seems to be a delay. I did also have a couple times where it seemed like they dropped the connection to my phone but picked it right back up.Sound wise there really nice. Loud enough and a clean sound. I'd say noise canceling is a bit to good,but not quite 100% noise canceling. Meaning you can still hear a bit with the volume lower but not quite good enough to listen to a conversation. I'm a runner and I'd hoped they would block out some ambiant noise but still let me hear cars.",3,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
I bought these for my wife as an anniversary present. We recently started going back to the gym for the first time in years and she was tired of borrowing my corded earbuds that I currently use. These didn't fit that well at first until we used the smaller little earbuds that they came with then they fit perfectly. She loves that they now fit perfectly and won't fall out of her ears no matter what exercise she is doing or how much she shakes her head.I tried them on also and the sound quality was amazing on these and is much better then my current corded earbuds I have been using. I'm going to buy a pair of these once my corded earbuds quit working. All in all we couldn't be happier with out purchase. Being able to throw them back in the charger and give them a quick recharge is awesome and very convenient. If you are looking for the perfect wireless earbuds for your next gym workout I would definitely give these a try. You will be happy you did.,5,1,2019-4-22,1,0,0
"I like the design and is easy to pair, the only thing I don't much care for is the left side looses connection or goes in and out a lot. I thought I'd give it some time but I've had them a month now and not getting any better. Only happens on the left side. I've noticed lots of reviews complaining about the same thing. I use them to watch videos on my Amazon Fire tablet and I'm only a foot away from my face. At this point I'm not real happy with them. When I does work they sound fantastic.After pairing with my LG Smartphone, there is no problem and quite happy with these ear buds. Great sound, clear voices and deep bass. I can only say that maybe some devices have a better connection than others. My apologies for the first review. I take it all back.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"This is my first pair of wireless earbuds and I couldn't wait to open them and try them out.  The sound quality is really nice , they were super easy to pair with my iPhone, the multiple sizes of ear buds made it easy to find a comfortable fit, and the charging case is foolproof.  I made a quick call to a friend to test the microphone and she said that the sound was clear and she could hear me perfectly.There are no function controls (volume, song skip), but I am able to use Siri to control those via these earbuds.  I'm assuming there is a similar function on most devices you might connect to, but that is something to consider if you require the function.",4,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"The sound quality is decent for the price, if you want any better be prepared to spend a lot more money than this. The noise cancelation is good enough to drown out what you want but allowing just enough to hear what you need to, i.e. your wife getting your attention easily. The battery life is perfect for working out, but if you wear it while working or watching videos after 4 hrs it tells you it has low battery power which is kinda annoying. That said it is described as 4 hr battery life and it has 4 hr battery life, so i can appreciate the accuracy of the product description. Though longer battery life is always better for what i use it for its perfect for the price. There light, can barely feel any weight in my ear. There perfect for running in the rain. They connect to devices easier than anything else I've used. They also allow the use to only use one ear bud at a time, so if you think about it like that is has 32hrs of battery life if you include the charging case. Example 1 last 4 hours it dies you use the other, 4 more hours, the case charges them an additional 14 hrs more and if you only use 1 at a time thats 28 hours there. So if you use 1 at a time they seemingly last forever before needing to charge the case and buds. 11/10 from me highly recommended.",5,1,2020-5-17,1,1,0
I wihs it was a little cheaper or may be I caught it at the pricey end of things in the Amazon world. Over all I am satisfied with the product. I have had it for a few days and am pretty happy with the form factor. My ear plugs are the ones that came fitted on the ear buds out of the box so I havent tried out the smaller one which I should. Over all battery life is pretty spot on 3.5 hrs it doesnt take too long to charge. I have not tested how long it takes to do a full charge but it should be a whole lot.In terms of missing features or not so great features: The micro phone is not really great could have been definitely better for the price I have paid $50.00 and there seems to be NO volume control on the device itself atleast i could not find any. Call receiving is a little hard since you have to press down on the device which can hurt your ear a little.,4,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0
"As soon as you get the Tozo box and start opening, you notice the quality of the product. Packaging is a science and how you product is displayed and put together in the box tells a lot, but the joy doesn't stop there. Tazo goes to  work right away. Pairs with your phone without any problems; fits on your ear like a glove; a female voice tells you your phones are paired. The box where the phones recharge is neat and well made; a magnet helps to make the connection. The sound is clear and nice. I've never been a fan of these ear buds, but this one impressed me. That happened at the moment I  figured out that if you insert the buds just right, there is a noise cancellation and the sound is crystal clear and with lot's of bass. I was impressed on how you can listen to sounds in the buds that are not distinguishable on speakers. Very impressed.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"I purchased these to replace a Jaybird headset. The Jaybirds never stayed in well and were a pain to charge. These earbuds though, what a night and day difference! The TOZO earbuds stay in my ears flawlessly. Sound quality is good. Battery life is good, I can easily get 5+ hours out of the buds before they have to go back in the charging case, and they charge fast once they're in there. Basically I get two full workdays, using one or both earbuds, before I have to charge the case. The only ""problem"" is that I can't get just the left earbud to work. I can do right earbud, or both earbuds, but if I take out just the left one it doesn't connect to the phone. NBD really.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"Earbuds work well for the most part. As far as sound goes they are good. They function as expected and are crisp and clear. They do cancel any noise around you when fitted into your ear properly. However, the fit in your ear is not the best. If you have small ears they tend not to fit well and feel like they are going to fall out at any moment.The wireless charging is a huge plus. If anything it outweighs any of the other issues this product has.",3,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0
"The first thing you'll notice about the Tozo T10 is that the charging-case is super bulky. Its like take up your entire pants pocket bulky. My first thought on the bulky case was that maybe the battery life would be better than my previous cheaper bluetooth ear buds (it wasnt). The ear buds themselves are also bulky but i got used to them pretty quickly. The sound quality is decent. I mostly listen to podcasts with them so as long as the sound isn't terrible and the noise canceling allows me to listen over my lawn mower I'm cool with it. My first big problem with it is that you can't listen to just the left headphone on its own. To get through my workday I usually put one headphone in so I could enjoy a podcast but be aware of my surroundings if im needed with my open ear. When the battery in one ear dies, I switch to the other. You can't do that with these ear buds which is disappointing  for me. More recently my charger case stopped easily connecting to my headphones so I have to really pay attention to them or they don't charge when I want them to. Also the headphones aren't shutting off with the bad connection so my podcast will continue to play even when the case when I think its charging. Its very frustrating. I'm hoping to return them.",2,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"I have started working out more frequently and found myself frustrated whenever I had to untangle my wired earbuds. Initially, I considered buying AirPods, but didn’t want to shell out that much for something that maybe wasn’t worth the price. I started researching wireless earbuds and found these. I was admittedly skeptical, given the price. The reviews were promising, so it seemed to be the best bet of all the Bluetooth earbuds under $100. I definitely prefer to buy thing that will last, but I also don’t want to overpay for hype.So far, I am very happy with them! I have tiny ear canals, but the small size covers will fit comfortably in my ears. setting them up and using them is super-easy. The sound is very nice for both podcasts and music, and the battery life is more than adequate. I must say that they feel very solid and well-made, and I am really glad that I bought these.",5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"I have bought at least three pairs of these in the past year. I love the sound quality. Nice and loud. Other ear buds i have purchased and returned because they were not loud enough while listening to music, audio books are just youtube videos.Yes, they lean more toward the lower bass frequency but for me it helps with the highs at a higher listening level. I am an audiophile so i do like a balance of listening levels. However for me at this point and wth these earbuds they fit the bill. They have a little more bass but not bad at all for $40. I would buy these again for just to have loudness or amplification of the sound.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"I'm a big Apple consumer and have many of the greatest products etc..  but after spending on the Airpods for my kids I wasn't in the mood to do so for myself. I began looking at alternatives and purchased a knock-off set of Bluetooth earbuds here on Amazon for around $30. Those stopped working on the first day. I was reluctant to try again but decided to try these given all of the great reviews. I have to say, I'm impressed. These are great. The range, features, professional packaging...they paired no problem with my iPhone running iOS 13 and my Macbook Pros. I was outside working in the yard, NOT getting tangled up anymore in my earphone cables. I bought a second pair of these for my wife.",5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"I am absolutely impressed with this product from the first sight. The packaging is well designed. I opened the product and it was totally intuitive how to get it to work, although very succinct instructions were provided. It came with a charge, but I connected it to top it off. The case is well made and the lights tell you exactly what the status is and you can see them whether the case is open or not. There are magnets to hold the earbuds in place and the top has magnets to close. Someone put a lot of thought into this product on every level. If first impressions are important I am going to be pleased with this product for a long time. Might get a pair for my wife also.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"just recieved these bad boys yesterday and have already put them to use. they connected pretty quickly to my iphone, the sound is really clear with just one in and even better with both in. the carrying/charging case is awesome, its magnetic so the earbuds stay in place and the lid stays closed. we will see how long it takes to run the battery down on all of it. there are a few cons to them: no volume or track controls(unless i just havent figured it out) so you just have a power button that turns them on and off but also answers/ends calls and plays/pauses music. then theres the back round noise that the people who you are on the phone with hear. apparently they pick up everything around you but its very clear on their end. as for the waterproofing i havent had them in water and dont think im planning on it other than sweat come the summer time. they also come with 4 sets of ear things so it should fit most anybody.for the price i dont really think you can beat them but only time will tell 9/10 would suggest picking up a set.",4,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"The audio is good for totally wireless earbuds. It’s fine for music. The mids are a bit low and the bass is punched up. I wouldn’t use these for audio editing but for any other application these will be plenty fine. It does make the sound feel a little cold right now.I wouldn't recommend these headphones if you listen to a lot of spoken word - like podcasts. The treble is way too sharp. I hear every single ""S"" sound. The sound bites and there's no way to dial it down.",4,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0
I have always had issues finding ear buds that fit my ears. I tried every single option that these come with (there's 4) and it still doesn't feel right. The sound quality is great. They came half charged so I could try them right away. They since via Bluetooth easily. They come with a little box for wireless charging which is amazing. I just cannot love them like I want to because they do not fit right in my ears and fall out easily or I have to really push them in deep to stay and that cannot be good on the ear drum. They do not lay flat in my ear so if you are one that falls asleep with ear buds in these are not for you as I imagine they would not be comfortable. I haven't decided if I will keep them for my husband or will be returning them.,3,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0
"Updated: these units are highly frustrating. When I use then for voice calls the person on the other end isn't able to understand me. Also if I am slightly active they cut in an out to the point that at times I can barely understand what is being communicated over them whether it is music over Pandora or listening to a podcast. I have had to fall back to my Bluetooth receiver and headphones. Boo!These are a good set of headphones with nice battery life. That quality of sound is pretty good though a little on the brass side not quite enough bass. They are big and don't quite fit comfortably into my ear so I can't wear them for extended lengths of time. Also I using one (1) headphone is irritating, when I remove the right one from it's base it connects fine but if I don't take out the left one as well I get this constant beep in the right one, would be nice as I am sometimes in areas that I need to be able to hear in one ear. It would be nice if they had an app I could install on my phone to see battery life and maybe other controls. I like the ability to charge on a Qi wireless charger so I don't have to fumble for a chord all the time and the headphones charge quite quickly too. They stay in the ear well and I haven't had one fall out yet. Voice seems to be clear as my wife didn't seem to notice when I was wearing them and talking to her or talking on my LG G6.",1,1,2019-5-22,1,0,0
"Unless you're a true audiophile (in that case you shouldn't even be looking at bluetooth headphones but that's a whole different topic) these are really the highest quality wireless earbuds you'll ever need. I've compared them side by side with several more expensive name brands that family members own and they hold their own or even best them regardless of the comparatively low price. If you're the type of person that just needs to be seen with the Apple ones then just buy those (in my opinion the Apple ones look pretty stupid with the ""tails"" they have, but that's subjective), but if you just want a high quality product, high quality sound, and don't want to break the bank then these are for you. I play a lot of mobile first person shooter games and one of the things I noticed immediately and I'm most impressed with is the extremely small lag time compared to wired headphones, I'll explain; all true wireless headphones have a slight ""lag"" compared to their wired counterparts, and while it may not be noticable to some when you depend on hearing every little footstep an enemy makes exactly as they happen the lag on some of the wireless buds I've tried could be the difference between life and death (gotta keep that K/D up😜), or even if you aren't into gaming on your phone and just watch YouTube/stream movies some of the brands I tried were so bad that I could see people's lips moving before the words/sound came out of the headphones, and that's super annoying to me, even if it's just by a fraction second of a second it's noticeable. Great deep bass, clear highs, and powerful output; very rarely do I have to turn them up past 50% and at 100% they straight up HURT. The included charger/holder is sturdy and delivers on its promise of charging the buds from dead to 100% 4 times and they include multiple ear pieces to ensure anyone can find a perfect fit. Haven't tested the water resistant claim through submersion, but, I've worked out with them several times (and I'm a #sweatyboi) and have noticed no ill effects. As far as noise cancelation goes, I used to use foam ear plugs to sleep and at work (auto repair) and find these cut the sound about the same as those so now I just leave these in when I'm ready to hit the sack and I've tossed the foam plugs all together. Super happy with my purchase and truly feel as though I got a superior product at a lower price vs. paying for a name brand just for the sake of having a name brand.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"Not a single good thing to say about these earbuds... well maybe they look alright? The primary use case I bought them for is running while streaming music saved on my Apple Watch gen 3- First thing I noticed, these sound ridiculously bad. I am admittedly not an ""average consumer"" of consumer audio products, I work in the industry and I have 'audiophilic' tendencies. That being said, these sound awful. Zero bass response, zero high frequency definition, these sound like crappy plastic headphones you got with a budget portable CD player in 2000.",1,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"I have Bose Quiet Comfort wired headphones, 1More wired earbuds and now the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds.  I have to say I am very impressed with the sound quality, ease of charging, great charging/carrying case and how easy it is to sync up to my bluetooth TV, iPad, computer, etc.  When you take one earbud out of the charging case it tells you that it is pairing with the other one.  Then it will tell you that it has paired with a second device if a second device is in range.  If there is more than one device you have paired it with in the past and they are all bluetooth on, it seems to go in order of preference for the first device ever synced, then the second device, third device, etc.  The TOZO T10 comes with 4 sets of foam tips so they should fit just about anyone's ears.  Overall sound is very balanced.  Not quite so heavy bass as my wired 1More earbuds but I think that has more to do with the fit than the actual frequency response. Being wired, the 1More earbuds don't have the added bulk and weight of a wireless earbud.  I tested the TOZO T10 using an online frequency generator on YouTube and they performed well from 20 Hz up to 15K Hz.  I also tested them on some bass heavy tecno pop and again they were very slightly overbalanced on the treble side.  Mid range is probably not as balanced as my Bose headphones but overall I am very impressed and pleased with the TOZO earbuds.  I've used Apple Airbuds and the TOZO is much better and the price makes them a steal.  Thanks TOZO for making such a great product at an incredible value!",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"I am a senior citizen who has ALWAYS had trouble connecting any kind of headset via bluetooth to any kind of device.  I am so happy to have found the TOZO T10 ear buds.  The directions for pairing were so simple that I was suspicious I would have trouble.  Far from it.  All I had to do was:  take the earbuds out of the black box.  The right bud started flashing red/blue and then connected to the left bud all by themselves in my hands!  I went to my bluetooth menu on my phone and there was ""TOZO-T10-R"".  One tap and I was connected.  You follow the directions for inserting the earbuds and they are very, very secure.  It comes with 4 sizes of buds.  I changed out the originals for the smallest size.  I reinserted the buds, found a song to play on my iTunes, and OMG!!  Everything worked!!!  And the sound quality is fabulous.  My old ears usually miss half the words on a song, but I could clearly hear every word!  How wonderful!..And a quick tap on the right earbud puts it in pause.  Another tap and I'm back to the song or book or whatever.  These earbuds do exactly what I've needed all these years.  Thank you TOZO.",5,1,2019-5-18,1,0,0
"I really like these. I have small ears and the last few pairs of earbuds I've had just haven't fit right. I was skeptical that these would work for me at first but after wearing them around my house, running with them in and working out, they've really impressed me. Totally worth what you pay for them, they're truly wireless, easy to use and you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears as they come with different size tips to fit all sizes. I'm also impressed with how easy they are to charge, you stick them back in their little carrying case and it charges them for you, so convenient! If you're second guessing yourself, STOP IT! Just get them!",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"I was excited to receive these after the reviews. I guess I didn't dig a little deeper in the reviews because my 1st day taking them on my normal journey to work in New York City wasn't as pleasant as I would like. Let's start with the connection between my phone and these wireless headphones. THEY STINK if your phone is in your pocket. The constant muting of each ear bud raises a red flag with me because if I can put my hand over my phone that's in pocket to make it mute out the earbuds, then how healthy can that be breaking that connection between phone and Bluetooth? Don't even bother having your phone in your back pocket because all you'll have is protection from the cold winter wind going in your ear and NO sound. I will say the sound if fire. I love the bass but I can get that same bass in a wired earbud. I'm definitely not satisfied with this $50+ purchase and I will not brag about it to anyone. I don't see the point in going through the grueling process of returning them so guess what? Someone I know will get re-gifted with this weak product for Christmas. Sound is EVERYTHING but without a promising connection, i'd rather step on them like a NYC water bug and move on with my life. Oh and resetting them did absolutely nothing. My phone is not even a week old so that rules out my phone #NeverAgain",1,1,2019-12-17,1,1,0
"When I ordered these earbuds, I was not expecting much because of how cheap they were. When I opened the package, I was slightly underwhelmed by their appearance, I ordered the khaki color - it was slightly duller than I anticipated, but it does not bother me that much. After charging them, I easily paired them to my smartphone and was IMPRESSED with their sound quality. I am not an audiophile, but these headphones sound great and the bass is shockingly better than I would have imagined. I have my daith and tragus pierced, and these headphones fit perfectly with my earrings in. They look large, but fit very securely. I tried to shake them out, and I was not able to no matter how hard I tried! Overall, I would highly recommend these headphones.",5,1,2020-3-23,1,1,0
"Let me just start by saying these bad boys are incredible, especially for the price! Both me and my husband own a pair. My mil accidentally washed my husband’s jacket without checking the pockets and one of the earbuds was in his pocket. She washed AND dried it! Guess what!? It still freaking worked! And it was still charged! Idk how! I know they are waterproof because I use mine in the shower but to be washed with tide pods and oxy clean and dried on high and still survive is AMAZING. My only complaint is that the battery life isn’t that long but they are also really cheap so it’s really not an issue. I don’t use mine past 4-5 hours at a time so it never really affects me anyway. The wireless charging feature is also a huge plus for me!",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"I'm tough on earbuds, and I only use them at the gym.  This pair is great.  First and foremost, they stay in place when I'm running on the treadmill.  I've lost 1 earpiece twice with buds slipping out and being shot under other equipment.  What's even better, the sound quality is really a step above any other buds in this price range.  I've never, nor will I ever, spend premium dollars on earbuds, but this shows that I really don't have to.  Finally, I've never had a pair of earbuds shut out the gym music, or people's voices, as well as these.

I will note that you don't have volume control on these headphones, or the capability to change your song, but this wasn't an issue for me as I have an apple watch and can adjust these things from there.

"I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my 17 year old daughter who is notoriously destructive on typical wired ear buds, sometimes going through two or three sets a month. If she's not watching YouTube videos on her phone she's streaming music non-stop. So today, on her 5th day of ownership, she's still just as thrilled with these as she was when she opened them. She's probably put 50+ hours of wear on them and has had zero issues with connectivity, sound, battery life, or noise. She left her phone downstairs and ran upstairs with her earbuds in and never lost connection or sound quality. They're definitely great noise cancelling ear buds as she doesn't even hear me shouting her name when we're in the same room.  The charging case is a convenient size for shoving in your pocket or bag, the buds sit securely inside the case and don't fall out even when shaken. So far we're thrilled with these ear buds and consider them to be a good value for the cost.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"I got these to wear at work and really like them! I went through maybe 6 of the top rated earbuds on Amazon and liked these the best. They feel quality, sound great, pair instantly when you take them out of the case, and the battery life is pretty good. The microphone is good enough for phone calls but it could be better. The KEY is making sure you have the right size  nozzle for your ears. When you have a good seal on your ear from the nozzle thats when these earbuds really shine! In an ideal world the microphone would be a little better and the battery life would last a little longer but for the price you cant beat these. Ended up ordering 3 more pairs as gifts.",5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"I received these two days ago as promised.  I was surprised to find them already charged and ready to go.  They fact that the case not only is a charger but essentially a power storage device is amazing! I was very happy with the easy of set up and the quick start guide. First time out of the box my ear buds did not pair correctly. Following the guide, I quickly did a reset by holding each buds button for 15 seconds, put them in the charging station for a few seconds, removed them once again and they paired instantly!The buds themselves fit comfortably and sound amazing. They are the perfect solution to my new phones lack of generic audio out jack.  As I travel frequently, I love that they recharge in the case without the need to find a outlet between planes!!  I’ll miss my big name, large over earphones, but paying 6X the money to move to their wireless version just didn’t make sense.",5,1,2019-6-26,1,0,0

They took the time to mail me a brand new pair for free! Well I was pretty satisfied, up until today. out of nowhere, my earbuds kept disconnecting and reconnecting. Then the womans voice my right earbud turned into a high pitched squeaky voice. i turned it off right away & attempted to turn it back on. Now it will not turn on at all and i tried charging it all morning through the afternoon.

"I have been super impressed with these little guys. First, I use these all day with one headphone in while at work. I have the volume at the lowest setting (on my phone) and one headphone literally lasts 5 hours of constant use. No exaggeration. Again, this is at the lowest volume setting, so I am sure that plays a big part. I listened to one headphone for 5 hours straight, then would throw it in the charging case and listen to the other headphone for the rest of the day. While doing this for a whole week, the charging case never ran out of juice. So basically for me, I charge the case & headphones on Sunday, then listen to them (one headphone at a time) Monday through Friday and put them in the case over night. And the case lasts all week without a charge.Even at the lowest setting, these sound amazing. I have had them up to mid to 3/4 volume, and they BUMP! Great bass while maintaining great sound quality. If you put them in correctly, they block out all exterior sounds.",5,1,2019-2-24,1,0,1
"Original msg:I just recieved these and already love them! The sound quality is pretty good (It'd be nice more base, but for the price, it's actually better than I expected.) The volume it very loud, not like some other earbuds I ever purchased; that includes the BOSE (wired wrap around ones,) and the latest model Beats by Dre. I was actually very disappointed by Beats earbuds. I paid $300+ for them, thinking they'd be as good as everyone claims they are, but the bass wasn't even that good, and the volume was low on them (maxing on my Galaxy cell phone.) The BOSE headphones are much better sound than Beats buds (and I'm sure BOSE buds are even better; only reasons I didn't go with BOSE is because they stick out way too much.)",5,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"I mostly use these for noise cancelation as I sleep. I think for the price you're getting a good product, the noise cancelation isn't mind blowing but its definitely noticeable. The quality of sound isn't as good as wired headphones, but its not terrible. They're comfortable weather I use them for sleep or just around the house. there are some definite drawbacks though.. Firstly the most the battery has ever lasted is about four hours and while four hours seemes like a lot it becomes annoying when you're in the middle of something and they start beeping and telling you to charge them. The charging base looks like it'll give you 4 charges, but the most I've gotten is 2.5-3. They are comfortable, but I have worn them as I do chores around the house and they can some times slip out so be careful, and try to find what ever size fits best. Over all these didn't replace wired headphones for me, but what I mostly wanted them for was sleeping and that has worked out pretty well for me although once in a while as I sleep they fall out which I totally expected and don't hold against them but its something to keep in mind if you want to use them in a similar way or if you accidentally fall asleep with them in. They are decent for the price that you are paying, but they aren't anything all that revolutionary in my opininon.",4,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"I count on reviews on Amazon when deciding what to buy.  I really was bothered to be asked specifically to write a favorable review (not just to write an honest review of my experience) to receive a free charger.  It made me wonder how many of the favorable reviews here were influenced.  I will post my honest opinion .. and NO... I am now not going to even ask for the charger plate.So I have had a decent experience with these, but they are also the first pair of wireless ear buds I have ever bought and most of the wired ear buds I have bought in the past are less than $10.",4,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0
"I'm really shocked at how good these are.  I've been hesitant to get any type of wireless earbud.  Mainly because I wasn't sure about keeping up with them and worried about them falling out.  These don't have that problem you can fit them to your ear with the provided attachments.  But I was floored by the sound, the bass, the quality.  I also like that I can wear it with only one ear in.  I can enjoy my music or an audiobook but can still hear the kids with only one in.  Both in really does cancel noise.  I can't say to what measure just yet but it works for me.  I love that I can charge the case on a wireless charger too.  The case feels really sturdy.  I'm just really impressed especially for the price.",5,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
"Update! The customer service is excellent!! I was contacted about our failed earbuds and was offered an upgrade or a gift card. I chose the new earbuds and they came quickly and appear to be working as expected. Very happy. Hope they continue working as well as they are now. Thank you!Initially these earbuds were terrific but after little more than 3 months, they no longer work. The case appears to be charging but they don’t work. I gave them as a Christmas present and am very disappointed.",5,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
"I am very excited about these. I just got them so I won't speak to their battery life or longevity yet, but so far, they are fantastic. They pair easily and immediately when you take them out of the case. The case is convenient, with magnets allowing the buds to click into place without fussing, and a satisfying magnetic closure as well. These fit snugly in my ears with the included ear caps, but there are 3 different sizes included if you need a different size for a better fit. They are comfortable to wear for a long period of time, and I like the one touch features for play/pause, and picking up and hanging up calls. I haven't tested the waterproofing yet, but this is a huge plus for me as I will be wearing them in the gym and I SWEAT.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"I had this product for several weeks before returning it. I used it extensively, especially while running, lifting weights, and doing yard work outside. Below are my observations and the reasons why I returned this product.1) Connection issues",1,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"I was hesitant of the quality I'd get for this price but my worries were unfounded. Item is well constructed, well designed, beautifully packaged. Sound quality is crystal clear with impressive bass. I love the way they snap magnetically into the case. No pairing issues. Tested the range and I can walk around 50-60ft away from my laptop without losing connection (although they lose connection immediately if I go behind a wall or heavy door).My only criticism would be that the instruction book is a little unclear, but that won't be much of an issue to anyone used to pairing bluetooth devices. It's fairly self explanatory.",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
I never review anything but feel like this product deserves one:I work in fitness and run/lift/row/box daily. I have probably invested over $1000 in headphones just for working out.,5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"These earbuds are amazing! I cant believe the quality you get for the price. They are very easy to use. Once you have them linked to the bluetooth on your phone it's as simple as pulling them out of the case that charges them. When you pull them out of the case they automatically turn on and connect. They last about 4hrs on one charge and I get roughly 4 charges out of the case. I have even used these in the shower without any issues. The case is easy to charge at the end of the day I just throw it on my wireless charger, no pluging in necessary. I would highly recommend if you are in the market for affordable wireless ear buds that offer the quality of some higher end brands.",5,1,2019-2-17,1,2,0
"I wanted a pair of wireless earbuds to replace an older Bluetooth headset. I'm deaf in one ear so I wanted earbuds with excellent sound quality first and foremost, and noise cancellation as a bonus for travel. Tozo's T10 earbuds are so far a great alternative to far more expensive models. They paired without issue out of the box with my phone and both music & video sound just as good as with a Bose over-ear headset. Noise cancellation for standard room noise seems good, I'll test these on my next flight to see how they do in that environment. I have smaller ears but the size and fit seems comfortable - the supplier includes various sizes of removable ear caps which is great for a custom fit. A short USB charging cable is also included as well as a wrist strap. So far so good.",4,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"So far there is nothing to dislike about the Tozo T10 wireless earbuds, but only all to love.I've had these for one week and the battery life is excellent; slightly exceeding the stated spec..",5,1,2019-7-30,1,0,0
"Most of the complaints I have with bluetooth audio are not as strongly present in these; they certainly don't sound as good as wired earbuds, but they sound better than any other wireless earbuds I've put in my ears. My complaints are:1. that they don't feel as secure in my ears as I'd like (though I could try the smaller rubber ear-pieces), but they haven't fallen out of their own volition yet, so my fears might be misplaced.",4,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
"I've had these since January 2020 my wife and son also have a set and enjoy them. Very easy to use, until now. My buds were having problems connecting.  I contacted support/warranty services and they provided me with the option of my money back or a new set of T6s. I took the T6 option. Obviously they stand behind there product.",5,1,2020-3-26,1,2,0
"My experience with the TOZO T10's so far has been a pretty good one, they are easy to set up, sound fairly good for bluetooth earbuds, and losing the wire makes it easy to sleep with them on and not have one of them get pulled out of my ear when I turn. They are extremely comfortable which makes me want to use them for any devices while lounging but there are some limitations as they don't have a built in volume up or down controls. Due to that, I wouldn't recommend using them with a Fire TV for example as that goes off the headphones audio levels and can't be adjusted. Other than that though no issues with anything. They charge really fast, feel durable, they came with different ear type pieces but the stock ones perfect for me, and have an IPX8 rating. (I haven't had the luxury to take them on an intense run yet but will update if anything goes wrong. though my cheaper IPX7 pair is lasting those so I'm not worried for these things.)",5,1,2019-5-9,1,0,0
"Top shelf product all the way, with one minor glitch, for me.4 hours is the time that you can use these earbuds before they need to be recharged. That may sound like a lot of time, but is it?  For me, the answer is no. I do an extensive amount of learning on the web,as well as viewing videos and so on. My ""typical"" day may be 6 hours or longer. So, 4 hours is not enough, for me.  Keep this in mind regardless of what wireless product you choose.",4,1,2020-5-22,1,1,0
AMAZING!!! i cannot stress this enough! I am a mom of a infant toddler who likes to pull on my headphones.. and who needs to bathe like 3x a day... while working from home ☎️🖥... im on the phone 8+ hrs a day and these T10's have been a life saver.... they come a in nice case that isn't too small or too big! I charge the case over night and pop the buds in and by morning they are at 100%  the case holds a nice charge and the buds do as well. The noise canceling feature is phenomenal.. did I mention im also a mom of 2 kids who are distance learning..  my house hold is a madhouse.. and my clients don't even notice.. they come with several different sized ear caps... and they sync up with no issues... waaay better than the air pods and Samsung buds I've purchased in the past... i will definitely be getting my $'s worth with these..,5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,1
"These checked every box for me. I think the sound quality is really great for casual listening. The bass response is really where these things shine. Very present without being fatiguing.I use these to listen to music at my desk at work. The noise cancellation and comfort is excellent. Controls are easy to use. Can't speak to the battery life as I keep these plugged in all the time, but I love that they snap in and out of case effortlessly and they pair and unpair without fail so far. That was really important for me personally.",5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,1
"The first pair I received had an issue where the left earbud kept disconnecting. I had a feeling this was just how it was designed. Cheap... $50 Bluetooth earbuds... you get what you pay for... I started to pack them back up to return. Instead of accepting it, I actually contacted the manufacturer.They helped troubleshoot them, and it turned out to be a defective pair. They sent out a new set and I am so glad that I decided to work with them.  They sent me out a fresh pair, and now they work great!",5,1,2019-9-12,1,0,1
"I love the buds, not as expensive as the Airpods I have purchased already. These Tozo10 earbuds fit inside your ear canal and doesn't move unless you take them out. You will have to discover which size silicone cover best fits you. The price was definitely on point. Everything in the photos are included plus you are offered a free year's warranty, within 14 days of purchase not to mention there's a 3 year warranty offered for about $6.00 (optional). I noticed that there's a beep for a few minutes but it does stop. The charge is within 20-30 minutes, only a USB cord is included all you need is a block for the socket. There's a string just incase you may lose or misplace the charger box. Please remember the right bud is the main source, you don't have to use both at the same time, but you will need to use the right one.",5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,1
"First set of ear buds, so can't really compare them to anything. They do connect to my phone and the sound is decent. The storage/charging box is a little larger than what I would like to carry in my pocket often.  I bought them mainly for using during a plane ride.  They arrived the day of my trip. I was able to use them in the airport to stream music. I was not able to stream on my phone and neglected to actually download anything for use during the plane ride, So I had less then 1 hour of use on them the first weekend I got them. They were put away for a month and not touched.  I pulled them out to use while doing work around the property, but they were dead. Sometime between the first weekend and a month later, they lost the ability to charge wirelessly. I recharged them with a cord and unpligged itnonce fully charged. Tested them out for 2 minutes and everything worked. Put the ear buds back into the fully charged case and they sat for 2 days. Completely dead again. Still wouldn't wireless charge, either. Everytime I charge them and the case, they are dead in 2 days without use. They have never been left on a charger more than 8 hours (overnight). I even tried charging half way with the cord and then trying to wireless charge, it doesn't work. I have tried 3 different wireless chargers and 2 Samsung S10s to charge them, no luck. Seeing as I do not use them often, and would have to know a few hours before using them so I can charge them, these are of little to no use to me. I am sure I will end up giving them to my son to lose.",3,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
"For $40 “true wireless” Chinese earbuds, I slightly expected worse, but was surprised with what I got. First and foremost, audio quality isn’t bad, but it’s just a tad off, and it is almost immediately noticeable. If listening while doing other activities, the slight jank blends in and it’s less noticeable. If you listen to a song you know very well, you’ll see the difference like night and day. Audiophiles be warned. People who are just looking for some tunes while they do other activities might consider looking into this.The earbuds themselves, again, have their flaws. There is a master and slave earbud, which means the right earbud must be on and connected for the left to work, so trying to double use-time by using one headphone at a time is not an option. Also if you’ve been listening to one earbud and pop in the left, there are some times where it won’t connect to the phone and I’d have to put the right headphone on the charger for a second for both to connect. Another personal flaw, which can be beneficial to some, is that clicking either headphone once pauses and plays music, and clicking it twice will call the last person you called. Personally I would have liked double click being to skip to the next song and a triple click to restart/go back a song. Now, the battery life on the earbuds are surprisingly good, lasting I believe five or so hours before the lady in the earbuds politely tells you to recharge them every 15 or so seconds, I don’t know how long they last after that, I turn them off on the second reminder.",4,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"I was washing dishes and one fell into a big mixing bowl full of water. I pulled it out fast and it continued working. Very nice. I also noticed people walk up to me not realizing l am listening to music. I am blasting it and only l can hear it. No more dealing with other people knowing what song l am listening to. This was previously a harsher review about battery life. Still a little bit of an issue, but they last fine as long as l put them back in their charging port every time l am done with them. These buds really grew on me after l wrote that review. I am now fixing it, in order to be fair to the product and to other customers who read reviews before buying.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
I bought these to use one ear in to listen to audio books while I work around the house or in the garage.  Audio is clear and easy to hear.  They stay in my ear just fine when doing around the house and yard jobs.  Only complaint would be the button on the rear takes a bit of force to press and it really jambs the ear bud into your brain when you use the button and the click is quite loud in your ear too.  You can use each one separately you just have to pair them individually.  If you are wanting an immersive listening experience with a wide sound stage and incredible sound reproduction I would say you really shouldn't be looking at bug style headphones anyways.  But with a good seal these are good enough for casual listening,5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"I wanted wireless ear buds since my new phone doesn't have a headphone jack, but I didn't want to spend as much as the apple air pods cost. These air buds have been a great compromise! The only thing I've noticed that I don't love is that they're pretty loud even at the lowest volume on my phone. I wear one at a time. On the flip side, they are great for noise cancellation. All in all, I definitely recommend this product and would purchase again!",5,1,2020-5-18,1,1,0
Update to my review:While I wasn't pleased with the headphones themselves I am very impressed with the customer service of the seller. They saw my review and reached out proactively to me. They said they had learned of a defect in some of their headphones and offered me a new pair or a full refund. Because I had already purchased new headphones I took the refund. It was sent via PayPal very quickly.,5,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"These have very nice sound quality and good fit, especially for the price. I gave them four stars because no sub-$40 earbud is going to compare with Apple EarPods or other high-end devices. But you don't give up much for the big cost savings. The package includes the charging box and a standard USB charging cable if you don't have wireless charging capability. Like the charging box, which has its own battery so stores extra power for the earbuds even if not plugged in.The only problem I've had is occasional problem maintaining earbud connectivity when using Zoom on my MacBook Pro and also in range of another Bluetooth device that has been paired with these earbuds. So far it has only happened when using Zoom, and doesn't always happen. I'm not sure if it is a software problem with Zoom, a system problem with my Mac, or a problem with these earbuds. But it wouldn't stop me from ordering them again.",4,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
I really like the feel and sound of these earbuds but the left earbud constantly drops out.  I've done everything to try to remedy this but no luck.  I'm using these with a Galaxy Note 9 and have no issues with any other bluetooth devices.*UPDATE*  Customer service has been in contact with me and offered to send a new pair of ear buds.  I will update my review upon receiving the replacement ear buds.,5,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
"I had a pair of the Purity one earbuds, and left them somewhere. I purchased these because they were a little more expensive and I guess in my mind I thought $=better. I was wrong. The first pair I bought stoped working in the right earbud, just a few days in. The company did quickly replace them, so kudos to that. These ones seem to always have a hard time connecting. The range is terrible. The Purity One earbuds I could walk 2 rooms away from my phone and they worked great. These ones disconnect as soon as something is between us. Then they don't always reconnect automatically when I am back in range. One ear bud is definitely quieter than the other. Maybe these work better for other people and different situations.l, not great for me, as I can't always have my phone in my pocket.",3,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"So, my Son ordered a different pair of earbuds, and I decided to look for ones that had better bass and sound quality than what he had purchased. These came in, and I absolutely LOVE THESE EARBUDS! I did have an issue with the left earbud, that stopped working. Contacted the company, and their customer service was AMAZING as well! There are replacing not just the left earbud, but sending out another pair! I was blown away with the earbuds, sound and bass quality, and definately with their customer service.UPDATE: So I received my replacement left earbud. I was BEYOND SHOCKED! Not only did it come as expected, but they sent a really nice travel case AND a USB charging port for them! It is different than the charging case that comes with the earbuds. It is a separate charging piece that goes directly into a USB port that the earbuds magnetically stick to. No cords needed. This is nice so I can charge the earbuds at my desk if I forget the charging case that they come with. THANK YOU TOZO!! THAT WAS AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE!! If I could rate this over a 5 star, I would. Not only are the earbuds amazing, but their customer service is as well!!",5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"I have an iPhone and tried air pods but they get stuck my hair when I move it and fall out. The different size ear pieces it comes with form perfectly to my ear and the buds DONT GET STUCK IN MY HAIR! The battery life on these is good and I can use my wireless charging pad with it. These work with my iPhone 11, Apple Watch SE, android tablet, and even my laptop. I like the display of the battery life for the case and you can see it through the case without opening it. I usually use them for the gym or a bike ride for their noise cancellation & wireless properties. The design is smooth and aesthetically pleasing, I recommend 😌",5,1,2020-10-6,1,0,1

"I have refused to to buy AirPods since the day they were released. The price of them is outrageous considering they something you can instantly lose within your first use. I have been buying wireless headphones off of amazon for myself and my kids, to try to find a cheaper alternative to AirPods without sacrificing the sound quality and durability. We have gone through so many and it’s always the same issues, poor sound quality, only one earbud syncing to our phones, can’t hold a charge, refuse to charge at all after a week of use, the list goes on and on. Then I bought these and OMG FINALLY!! These things can hold one hell of a charge, and I love that I only have to remember to plug in the charging case once a week. When they say it can charge you earbuds four times before needing a charge, they weren’t lying. They charge them up FAST and the earbuds can be used for hours without dying. The sound quality is awesome as well for the price I paid! I already have more in my cart to buy for my kids. These are worth absolutely every penny I paid and I cannot be happy enough with this product!",5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,1
"Sound quality is amazing for the price compared to my previous ""cheap earbuds"". The fit is also very good as I'm a big person and have very large ears that earbuds love to slip out of. The first thing I did was move my head around and shake and they didn't fall out. They charge quickly and snap right into the provided case via magnets. Everything is labeled clearly and comes in a clean retail box. If I have them at nearly full volume I can't hear people in the same room talking. I tested out the dynamic bass range with ""I love big speakers"" by Bass Boy and the drivers held their own surprisingly well. These will definitely be my goto buds for a while since the company offers and 18 month warranty on the product.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
I had to return these. I am not an audiophile but I have purchased quite a few set of different style headphones. I didn't expect to have an out of this world experience for the price but way too much treble and way too much bass. I used Amazon music app's equalizer to taper it down but there wasn't much to offer after that. In fact I was hearing a static or digital distortion even when streaming in ultra HD. These have a very unimpressive to nonexistent mid range but again for the price you pay you aren't going to get a balanced sound. I would recommend for someone looking for a cheap option that uses them or calls or maybe something to use occasionally like to the gym.,3,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
"If you love deep, rich, booming bass, then these are for you.  This isn't muddled bass but strong, full sounding bass.  They are also very comfortable to wear ...I can keep them in for hours without fatigue.  Battery life is good (about 4 hrs), the volume is plenty loud at 50% ..and the charger case will charge wirelessly (or with included usb cable)  Three sets of tips included to insure a perfect fit.  These are comparable to my Bose Soundsports (really) at 1/4th the price.  Phone calls are clear.  I would of given 5 stars if you could advance tracks and control volume.UPDATE:  I can't believe the fidelity of these earbuds.  Updating to 5 stars regardless of the advance track and volume control (or lack of)  These SURPASS my Bose SoundSport in every way ....comfort, bass, overall sound ...I can't describe the sound quality enough ....I must have 10 pair or more of wireless earbuds ...each almost hitting the mark ...these surpass the mark ...these will hit those sub bass notes ...and in a pleasing way ...they rival an expensive pair of over the ear headphones.",5,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0
Just received it today and charged it fully before testing it out.  This earbuds sounds pretty good for the price but I have to return it due to left earbud keeps on loosing signal.  I found out that every time my arm goes over the right earbud the left side loses it signal. For example when I do sit-ups with my hands behind my head the left side started to lose signal.  I tried to cover the right earbud with my hand to see if the problem exist.  Surely  enough the left earbud loses its signal when I cover the right earbud with my hand.  I will probably not buying these earbuds again due to the above problem .  Also it doesn’t have control for volume and skipping tracks. Return the first pair and bought another pair.  Unfortunately the same problem with left earbud lost connection.  I really want to keep it but sadly I have to return it the second time.,1,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"Great product for the price, after 1 week or so, I am totally impressed with fit, function and ease of use. I have been using Klipsch, wired for many years, these may or may not sound as good but I am at the point in my life where the weakest link in my sound system is my ears. It is incredible not to be tethered to my tablet or phone. They are very good at sound exclusion, I can use them instead of earplugs while running a chainsaw AND listen to music! It is a WHOLE lot easier to walk through the woods without the wires catching on pretty much EVERYTHING. Frankly, if I could give them more than a 5, I would. The cost is low enough that I I damage or lose one, I don't have to declare bankruptcy! Thanks Tozo!",5,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"I bought these for the stylish look and wireless charging capability. I thought they would be a great addition to my earbud collection. I was wrong!! The sound is good, but the problems! Just as with some of the other reviewers who had the same issue, the right earbud does NOT hold a charge even while sitting in the charging case. I had to keep charging the case because the right earbud kept discharging. The right earbud would also run out of battery about 2 hours before the left one. These also seemed to turn on and connect while in the charging case and not being used!I only gave one star because the sound was good. Don't waste your money on these.",1,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"When I first purchased these, I ended up getting a faulty pair, but I got into contact with Tozo’s customer service and they were absolutely amazing! Gave me a new pair at no extra cost, and went above and beyond to make sure that I was happy with my purchase. My new pair works great. I love how there are many options for the earbud sizes to accommodate different sized ears. The sound quality is great and the noise cancellation is surprisingly good as well, which is something I’ve never experienced before from earbuds. The case is also nice and sleek. Great company and I’d gladly purchase from them again!",5,1,2020-4-27,1,2,0
"The whole setup is very nicely done. Construction and materials appear very high quality. Setup, charging, and pairing was a snap. I've seen a few reviews that complain about losing the pairing, but I've not experienced that at all, either between the buds or with the phone. Overall, it's a very good first impression.Sound is decent, although it's a bit weak in bass (expected for an earbud). I was able to do some sound tweaking in SoundAlive (Samsung app) and they sound much better. If you insert them correctly in your ears, they seem to keep ambient sound out fairly well also. Overall, the sound is quite decent, especially for an earbud.",4,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"These are actually pretty decent wireless headphones. The charging pod seems pretty sturdy and charges the headphones easily and reasonably quickly (couple of hours to max charge). The headphones fit my ears perfectly, they don’t move at all no matter what I’m doing. Because they fit so well, outside noise is quiet and the sound is nice for wireless.The biggest flaw with these, and basically any wireless headphones, is the battery. I can get about 4 hours per headphone, and I only wear one at a time. The problem is the misleading battery life on the phone itself. I check, and it says I still have 70% battery life on the headphone. 30 minutes later, and the headphone is telling me, every 30 seconds, that the battery is low. So you need to keep track of when you started using the headphones and not go beyond 3 or 4 hours before charging.",4,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"These are truly awful. The sound quality is great, however they absolutely will not stay in. They are very, very heavy and large. I don’t have small ears at all, but even with the smallest “nozzle” (for lack of a better word...they come with different sizes) I have to ram it into my ear. Over the course of 5 minutes they slowly push out. The large, heavy outer portion is supposed to nest in the fold of your ear, but once they start pushing out, this no longer works. The earbuds fall out about every 5 minutes. I returned them. Horrible design. But again, great sound. Zero noise cancelling, which is what I had hoped for. That was a plus. But they are useless if the won’t stay in your ear.",1,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"I'll admit that I would have overlooked these earbuds had they not been on sale. I mean really, who has heard of Tozo? But, boy am I happy with these things. the sound quality is phenomenal. The trick is to get the proper fit. So, if you are considering getting these, follow the documentation and try all the ear pieces. I had to swap the medium size installed for the large size, included, and when I did the sound just opened up. The lows, mids,  and highs all come through. And that's at all volume levels, which I consider the true test of any audio reproduction device. Getting the proper fit means they are also very comfortable to wear for extended periods. I can easily wear these earbuds and outlast the battery before I have to remove them. They are very comfortable. Speaking of the battery, I'm getting somewhere between 3 to 3 and a half hours of battery life, of continuous play, before they have to go back into the charging case. Considering their size, that just blows me away. I just can't say enough about these earbuds. Had I known these earbuds were this good, I would have gladly paid the full price for them. Tozo is a name that will definitely get my attention in the future. Yes, I am that impressed with these earbuds.",5,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"I especially wanted wireless earbuds to use while wearing a face mask. I like that these are comfortable in the ear. (different sized ear covers included). Also, they charge easily and the lights indicating the charging is visible with the cover open or closed. I haven't tried it with a charging pad yet because I don't have one, but I love that there is that option as well as using a USB. The sound quality is very good especially considering the price. I have not given an 5 star rating on sound quality because it seems to cut out at times, although I can't confirm that this is a problem with the ear bud or maybe connection with my phone.  I would recommend these ear buds as a great price and very good quality.",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
"When I first ordered these earbuds I honestly was not expecting too much out of them seeing that they were under the $50 mark but oh boy am I happy to say that they proved me wrong!I love playing rhythm games and listening to music and these pair of buds made things so easy and enjoyable, the sounds quality is superb and they ACTUALLY FIT MY ODD SHAPED EARS. Only twice have I had them fall out of my ears and both times were during an intense run so I honestly cannot complain.",5,1,2020-4-7,1,0,0
"I have a few different types of wireless headphones and none of them have really impressed me.  So, I decided that I needed a really good pair and searched through Amazon and read a lot of reviews.  The reviews for these TOZO T10 wireless ear buds were really good and after reading about 30 of them I clicked the buy button and ordered a pair for myself.The buds arrived within in a day and so far I have fell in love with these little babies.  First of all they synced up with my iPhone right away with no issues.  If you sync one of them, the other follows automatically, just give it a few seconds.",5,1,2019-6-4,1,0,0
"Product is good. Nice audio quality and they stay in place while running. Color options are great too. Slightly disappointed with the size of the case, the shortness of the charging cable, and the fact that it does not use USB C for the charging port like any modern device. They also do not fit well in my ear personally so they hang down and look awkward which is a bit embarrassing.Overall very happy with the product and feel I have my money's worth at least.",3,1,2019-11-20,1,2,0
"I wanted, since I own AirPods, to get Beats Pro for better noise isolation when needed but cost and bad reviews on quality prevented that purchase.  I've used these for several weeks now on my morning walk and on balance am very satisfied with my purchase.  Yes, they do sometimes get out of sync with each other but then so do my AirPods, though not as much.  I keep my phone in my right back pocket and if I move my right arm up or down sometimes that will cause the issue and sometimes nothing I do causes any problem.  (Bluetooth is just weird.)  I listen mostly to podcasts and audio books but they are acceptable for music with decent bass with the proper seal.  On that issue, I could not get a proper seal with the included ear tips.  Or if I did they fell out easily.  No problem, I have lots of tips from over the years and found a set that works.  As far as the charge goes, they last through my walk which can be up to 90 minutes.  After two recharges in the case I have to charge the case itself but for my purposes that's not a problem.  I can't speak to how long they'll play without being put back in the case beyond the 90 minutes.",4,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"I could not justify spending a lot of money for Airpods for my two young sons (ages 10 and 12). These are just as good, but much less expensive. I bought a set for me. GREAT sound quality, good range of bass and treble, and blocks out outside noises quite well. Very easy to pair - we paired them to Android phones, Chromebooks, and Amazon tablets very quickly. Carrying case doubles as a charger. Battery lasts long between charges. Well made, have had them for several months and have had no issues so far. Overall this is a very good quality product, a good value for what you pay. Very satisfied with this purchase, will buy again and/or recommend to friends.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"I read reviews on numerous products as I wanted  these as a gift to my husband. Although some reviews for this kind/brand were negative, overall it seemed to be the best. I’m so glad I went with this pair because they did not disappoint! My husband LOVES them! They sound great, feel great, and have a long battery life. Due to a weird situation, he lost one. We ordered a 2nd pair of these. He didn’t want to look up any others because he was so pleased with these. The 2nd pair is also fabulous!Added later: these are still going strong over a year later. My husband uses these several times a week while at work. He also uses when he mows for several hours at a time. The battery still lasts just as long. His only complaint is they come out when he gets really sweaty. I suppose that could partially be due to ear shape. But, he still gives them 5 stars.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
"So... I pulled the trigger on these because of the driver size...  It's 8mm.  Most the others are way smaller.  I ware it at work on sound volume 1 so it's PLENTY loud onough.  And my music type is bass heavy EDM.  I have subs in the house, subs in the car, and these earbuds are delivering sound quality and enough bass to mention a 5 star review.  Con - no volume controls or skip (not a big deal my phone is always on my hip). It has easy play pays so that's what I use most anyways.  And the case size is big n clunky.  I am male with big pans pocket though... Meh.  For under 40$ I would buy again.  If one breaks, lost, or whatever.  I can get 4 pairs before $$$ mapple ones.  Quality seems fine but time will tell if it's junk or good for a couple years!",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"I don't typically give bad reviews, but I am very disappointed with these earbuds.  I've had them for 2 days and giving up.  I am sending them back for a refund.  I'm not sure if they are defective, or just not good design.  First of all, let me comment on the design.  I don't know why, but I had an extremely difficult time getting them to fit my ears.  They keep falling out.  I tried the medium and went to the smalllest sized ear caps.  After jamming them in my ears as much as I could, they would still fall out.  As for the sound. Not good. There is no bass.  I might expect this sound from a $10 pair of earbuds, but not a $34 pair.  Disappointed.  These are not going to work for me.  I will say the case was nice.  It felt rugged and charges wirelessly.",1,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
"These have good sound quality. I can really crank up my jams without any crackling or other bag sounds.My biggest problem with these is that they continuously fall out of my ears. I have the smallest ear pieces attached because that's what I've always used on headphones with no issues. These work their way out of my ears even when I'm sitting still at my desk! I've had them fall out and into the dirty kitty litter while I'm scoping boxes (btw, I've had no issues with wiping them down and sanitizing them, sound quality is still there), and I've had them fall out several times while I'm burning our burnable trash, which has always been at night and I'm on the ground with a flashlight. I wouldn't even try these riding my bike because they are consistently falling out of my ears. I guess my ears just don't like them.",3,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0

I would recommend this product!September, 2019 UPDATE: Left ear bud constantly cuts out. Reset both ear buds. Put back in charging case, fully charge. Delete pairing from my iPhone. Re-pair, reconnect...STILL constantly cuts out. It worked well in the beginning for a bit but longevity of the product is questionable.

"These earbuds are easy to charge and pair. But as a runner and cyclist, I NEED to skip songs and adjust the volume without going into my device. I was seriously shocked to realize that these can do neither of those things!! NO SKIP OR VOLUME CONTROL. I just assumed these would because almost every pair of earbuds on the planet allows you to control your music. I’m actually shocked more people don’t mention this in their reviews!! It’s a TOTAL deal-breaker for me. Otherwise they were great and sounded amazing, although I was unimpressed with the battery life.

"I have had these ear buds right under 3 months, but hadn't had a need to use them frequently until these past 2 weeks. They are a nice sleek design and seem to be made well /durable. They do very well at canceling out background noise, as well as good sound quality when it comes to phone calls, streaming videos, etc. I give them 3 stars, because the first issue, right off the bat, was that no matter which rubber ear sizes I use, hold them securely in place for extended periods of time (unless you're just sitting or laying in one place). I would not be able to workout or extended walking without constantly having to push them back into place. Second, which may be a contributing factor to my first problem, is the weight of them. I use them to listen to my Bible study and after an hours wear, I have to take them out because the bottom portion of my ear where the outside base sits, physically aches and throbs for up to 5 mins after taking them out. Last, yet the most aggravating thing to me about these is that you really only get 70% usage out of the battery, unless you don't mind being prompted every minute or two, during that last 30%, they need recharging!These are my first pair of wireless ear buds, so I only have my old wired earbuds you connected through the jax to compare them to.",3,1,2020-7-18,1,0,1
"This is the 4th pair of wireless headsets that I have purchased. Very simple to 'install', join up quickly, find other bluetooth devices quickly. So far they are the best, and the noise reduction is very good - better than the noise reduction headset that I use on airplanes, tho these are a bit newer (technology). I picked a banjo + guitar piece on my phone, played it on top volume on the table and could barely hear it while listening to a clarinet and orchestra solo with these buds. Pretty excellent. The various size ear seals makes a tight fit possible. Not sure if I'd run with these on for fear of losing one, but walking and performing simple tasks, leaning over, etc., is no problem at all. Like these a lot. Can't judge battery life, just received the set, only have ~ 2 hours after charging.",5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"Needed a pair of earphones to use running as my regular ones constantly came out of my ears. I was wary about these at first. They arrived quickly and in the box are the head phones, charging case, ear pieces to adjust size as needed, USB cord to charge, instructions, 1 yr warranty, and a cord to attach to case for carrying.Very easy to use. As soon as you take them out of the charging case they pair to each other. If your Bluetooth is on - they will then pair to your phone. Good fit - no issues with falling out at all. Sound quality is great - could even make out bass on songs which sometimes isn't as clear on cheaper headphones. I was able to go a good distance from my phone before they disconnect. If you need to hear something or speaking to someone you will need to take one out even on low volume or off. Charging is easy - stick them back in the case. They will charge up to 4hrs if case is not plugged so great for work. I am very impressed.",5,1,2019-4-1,1,0,1
"Bought these in mid-November 2019 as a more affordable substitute for Airpods and so far it has lasted well for 2 months.  Bought these mainly for when exercising and running. Sound quality is pretty good when you can fit it into your ears. However, the earpads are way too large. Even the smallest size that comes with it is too big for my earholes so the buds easily fall out within seconds of inserting them in. I also don't like how there isn't a configured option for the buttons to press when you want to skip/replay songs. The buttons seem to only be configured for calls. To be fair, I have not tried taking a phone call with these buds yet so I cannot attest to how effective the mic is. Charging case is also somewhat larger than expected but not an issue.My main gripe is the earbud pad sizes. Never have been a fan of earbuds that violate your earholes but it seems like this is the style going forward. Much prefer the bud style of Airpods/Apple Earphones but wanted to avoid paying >$100 for headphones.",2,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0

However over the last few days my ears ache after wearing them for more than an hour. i’ve tried other headphones and they don’t give me the same pain... they sound great and from what I can see the battery is great but I have to give them a one star because they hurt my ears and I can’t use them...",1,1,2020-8-16,1,1,0
"I really wanted to like these earbuds. The sound is ok, noise cancellation is pretty good, and the battery life is pretty good. However, they don’t always charge. Also, when I listen to these headphone, there will randomly be a ear piercing, high-pitched chirp. I don’t know when it is coming, so I can’t brace for it. It happens at random times. Sometimes it happens within 5 minutes of using them, and sometimes it is after 2 hours. It happens when the battery is full, when it is low, and when the battery is half filled. I can’t wear them as much as I’d like because I can’t handle the noise. I am so disappointed I wasted my money on these.",2,1,2020-7-13,1,0,1

"I've had these only a few days, but I really love them.  They work exactly as advertised.  They're so comfortable in my ear that I forget that they are present.  They have never yet fallen out.  I listened to a 3-hour talk show and then 2 hours of music while working in the yard.  The batteries held up fine.  For the price paid, the music's range (bass to treble) was great.  Stereo was also great.  I wish that the transmission range (distance from my smartphone to the earbuds) was greater, but the working distance was well within the advertised specifications.  There is no problem if I keep the phone with me.  Storage and re-charging are just too easy!  This set is a keeper!",5,1,2020-4-21,1,1,0

"I was skeptical at first, I have tried several different brands. The all lead to disappointment, even the expensive ones. I  was very impressed with the quality right away in the storage recharging container and the earbuds themselves. For phone calls, I have experienced no problems at all and could clearly hear. For music and sports radio, was excellent, the first time it was really loud because on my old units I always had the volume full. With Tozo you will need to turn it down which is a good thing. The battery life I have found is about 2-3 hours of continuous use, decent usage and they charge quickly. Overall the quality really surprised me, I have had them about a month with no serious issues. I have noticed one thing, occasionally the one earbud will disconnect after a period of time with no use, then it will quickly reconnect to use again.",5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
"So far I’m quite pleased with these earbuds. It was super easy to pair to my phone and the sound quality is top notch-good base and I’m even picking up some background vocals I never noticed before! This is my first pair of wireless earbuds, so in terms of fit, they are fairly comfortable And secure. I like the variety of fitting as I’m using 2 different sizes to make a good fit. It takes an actual push-click to pause your music instead of a light tap and the buds themselves don’t control volume, which I guess was an assumption on my part.  They have a pretty decent range for me in terms of leaving my phone in one spot and still remaining connect on the other side of my average sized apartment (it’s better than my wireless speaker).",4,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0

When headphones are in, if wearing both, can't hear anything in the environment -- would not be safe to use both when walking/jogging!  Problem is, microphone doesn't work.  People can't hear me at all.  Tried using together, separately, nothing works.....Tried one more time and finally got the microphone to work.  Both audio and mic worked for about 10 minutes, then suddenly both quit!  Had to drop out of my call and reconnect with my laptop speakers and mic.  Missed important discussion on the call.

My other main issue is that I haven't even had them for a week and the left earbud started cutting in and out with static on the 2nd day.",3,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0
I bought these and was very excited to put them to use. As soon as i got them I went and connected them to my phone and the process was seamless and easy. I then went and proceeded to watch a movie with them and the sound quality was great and just like i was listening with my own ears. I have worn them throughout the day and they haven't died. I charge them through the night and they last me throughout the next day without any low battery warnings or them dying. The case is very durable and i have no fear of the earbuds being broken or destroyed with them in my pocket they are a great buy and definitely a would recommend item.,5,1,2019-12-23,1,1,0
"Three things to love. The price, the fit and the sound. The first concern was the fit. I am sure this is an individual judgement as all people have different size and shape ears. After brief experimentation, I found the correct tip for my ear. Not only are these comfortable, but the best part is they remain in place as I am moving about.The sound is amazing, the bass is rich and there seems to be clear separation of instruments as I listen. I am not extremely knowledgeable with technical audio comparisons but I am a music lover. I do own a set of Bowers and Wilkins PX7 headphones and while these two items shouldn't really be compared, I am enjoying the TOZO T10 just as much for obviously different reasons.",5,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
"When opening the box, it seemed surprisingly better quality than I expected. Upon closer inspection however, you can see it is indeed cheap Chinese manufacturing. These are Bluetooth earphones under 50$ though, so that is to be expected. It comes with 3 sizes of ear buds, the smallest being the only one that fits me, and even so I’m constantly adjusting them to stay in my ears. It’s a minor nuisance but a nuisance nonetheless. Regarding sound quality, there’s way too much bass, it drowns out the mids and highs but not enough to completely ruin the experience. I use these solely for the gym, so it’s not a big deal to me, but I don’t use them any other time. Battery life is pretty good. I use these about 1.5-2hrs per day, 5-6 days a week on one charge. So roughly 9-12 hrs span for my usage. There’s no controls on the device themselves to adjust volume from what I can see, and the button is on the lateral portion of the earbud, so if you try to turn them off/on in your ear, you’re going to dig it deeper and cause some pain or discomfort. They are waterproof which is why I bought them, I sweat profusely and have ruined headphones before. So far they’ve held up just fine. Lastly, I clean my ears regularly, but since I have to shove them in so far just to maintain position, they accumulate ear wax and it grosses me out. All in all, you get what you pay for and they’re not that bad. However I would not recommend them for anything other than use for exercising.",3,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0

Example: If i have my phone in my back pocket and I sit on my phone, the signal gets cut on the hearbuds. If I'm in an office where there are several Bluetooth signals, connection drops in and out.The earbuds are loud when connected, though you can only control volume through the device you're connected with (ex: Phone). A slight annoyance for me is that I'm unable to skip to the next song using the earphones. A person can use the earphones to make calls and answer call though. However, I've not taken a call using them because of the worry of the weak Bluetooth signal.",3,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0

I *liked* the product when it was working, I like it a lot less now that I’m having to deal with a problem and the seller. The process is a headache.",1,1,2020-7-14,1,1,0
Ok I bought these as my back up pair. So I hadn't used them until recently I lost one of my buds from other pair of my soundpeats so Tozo was up to bat. Tozo had good reviews so I ordered them. At first sound quality is nice and clear. The battery of the buds wasn't too impressive compared to my soundpeats but they were ok. I was content with them but then the right bud stopped working. It shows it's connected but no noise coming out. I looked on line for a fix and found the reset instructions. Still didn't work. I did it again and nothing. So I can only use the left bud. Very disappointed in the product. Would not recommend anyone buying them.,3,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"I must admit, when first purchasing this product I was skeptical. The Bluetooth headphones I came from were really good but they werent wireless. After purchasing this I found that these headphones were much better than I thought! I've grown to really like them. The sound quality is pretty good. And they fit in your ears comfortable. The range was so so at times but this may have been because I had a faulty right ear piece.Recently the right ear piece died on me for no apparent reason. And because of this the headphones were useless. I reached out to customer service and after trying some trouble shooting they sent me a new right earpiece. It came in the mail surprisingly within 2 days!! I was very impressed. Typically its a hassle when it comes to things like this but the agent was nice and the experience was pleasant. After receiving the ear piece I just synced it to the left ear piece abd so far so good! I would say because of the food customer service its worth trying them out.",4,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"Long story short, I was researching the Airpod Pros but just couldn't justify spending $250 on them. Sure, pairing them with my iPhone would be super easy - but, pairing these with my phone was just as simple IMO. When I first opened up the box and took them out of the case they immediately went into pairing mode and my phone has no trouble connecting. They are very comfortable with the soft ear tips. I am using the size that was already on it, but there are several other sizes as well. So far the sound quality is great. Surprisingly strong bass. Haven't had them long enough to know about the battery life, but I love that it is compatible with wireless charging. Overall a really solid purchase! Honestly not sure what else the Airpods would have given me.",5,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
These are everything they claim to be. They sound great and they fit nice and comfortable.  They are easy to pair and control. I also liked the Khaki color.  Honestly I wasn't expecting much. But I was pleasantly surprised and  impressed by how much I liked these.  By the way the Bass response is definitely impressive.  I haven't put them in water yet. But so far they have adhered to all of the performance claims in the description. So I have no doubt that water will not harm these.  Glad I bought these.

"I got these ear buds primarily for running, and I’ve switched out the small ear piece to the appropriate size. I’ve spend a lot of time messing around to get a better fit each time I use them- also following the directions about “twisting it in”. Especially frustrating when it loosens and falls out while I’m actually running. It’s fallen out once on a night run and I had to pause my run and use my phone flash light to see where it had bounced off to. It just doesn’t really fit that great for me.During my runs my ear buds will also temporarily cut off sound like a sound bar does when it’s switching audio settings. I haven’t touched them or messed with any keys on my phone but it’s consistently been happening each time I use them.",3,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"I purchased these headphone because my Beats just stopped working and I had difficulty with customer service so I said forget it. I have had the TOZO wireless earbuds for over a week now. I can say that they provide great sound quality during my gym workouts and while I'm hiking on trails and cycling throughout the city to work. I am a heavy sweater when it comes to working out but I have had no issue with sweat getting in my ears and shifting the buds while I run. The earbuds stay in place. They are inconspicuous, which I LOVE. They can be used separately. They fit snuggly in my ears so I dont worry about them slipping out. I do participate in water sports and a few extreme sports but I'm not sure if these would hold up well while I'm in action. I'll come back in a few weeks to update those that want to know how they hold up while doing water activities such as rafting and canoeing.

I don’t know why, I’m guessing signal interference, It is very sporadic and not all the time, but once in a a while, one side will cut out repeatedly four or five times over a thirty minute period.

You have to have a right earbud to even use your left ear bud! (Because the left has to connect to the right one) I simply again asked can I please send you all these three  earbuds back! All I want is a new pair that actually works! I have now heard nothing back from them for 3 days! I paid for a warranty but, they are telling me I am still under my manufactured warranty!  So I guess I just wasted my money! Also wasted my time haggling with these people! I wasn't asking for anything other than what they should do!  Hope you don't waste your time or money!",1,1,2020-8-18,1,1,0
"These work great! Even tried them in the shower and they are still working perfectly. Only thing is they do get a slight crackling sound on songs with heavy bass or high mid sound. All 3 pairs we purchased have done this since day 1. It's not too noticeable, especially if you don't listen to them on too high of a volume. They cancel outside noise beautifully so high volume isn't needed!  They do work for making phone calls but you almost have to yell for the other person to hear you, so not sure they're good for that in public places. There is no delay between right and left ear. Battery life is crazy good. I use them to listen to music when I go to sleep and they stay in my ears, are comfortable to lay on and the battery lasts all night. They lay very flush to the ear.  All in all, I'd definitely recommend these headphones!",4,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"I'll state upfront that I have always prefer headphones, which I feel are more comfortable and have better sound quality, but I needed a good solution for conference calls and portability. These exceeded my expectations. The rubber tips help them stay in my ears well without constant adjustments. So I tried them out for morning walks, and they were great! Quality on calls clear. No problems with static or echoes as I have experienced with other ear buds. Easy to connect to laptop, phone or whatever. Music quality is impressive. These handle hight notes and bass well for price point. Battery life is good. I would definitely recommend.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"Although Bluetooth technology has been around for a while, these ear-buds seem to use a better technology and better environmental protection or proofing of each of the earbuds.  Connection and pairing is simple; nothing new other than have the source and destination be aware of each other. Listening is even easier, as they disappear from being noticed as there are no wires to distract one from doing something without the worry of losing an earpiece.The TOZO T10 Bluetooth ear buds both charge in a charging case that is included, and they can be recharged even when the charge base is not connected to power. I enjoy the freedom and the quality of sound they produce. They are great for some bass-ness of beat but have a tremendous range for the full audio spectrum.",5,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"They look great, sound great, plenty loud enough.  I love the case and charging in the case.  Was able to switch out earbuds with the included ones and find the right fit.  I had to knock off one star for the range.  After 10-15 ft they start crackling and losing signal and even when close every so often they do this, it isn't enough to make me want to return them but can be annoying.  Luckily my workout stuff is all withing 10 ft so range isn't a problem for me but as I said they do cut out for no reason every so often.  If you are looking for long range these won't do for you but if you want a fairly priced good sounding wireless buds for close range(like working out as I did) these work well.",4,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"These earbuds were perfect for people who like smaller non bulky earbuds, the sound quality was nice and the pairing was pretty smooth most of the time. The battery doesn't last long on the case but the earbuds stay alive for quite some time. THe  thing i didn't like about them is usually earbuds have 1 tap/click for pause and 2 tap/click for skip, but on these if you tapped twice it calls the last person you called and instead you have to pull your phone out of your pocket to skip a song. Another minor detail is the buttons are full on push in buttons, so when you press them it is uncomfortable since you're pushing on your ear, but if you have to get your phone out to skip a song anyway it doesn't make much of a difference.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0

"This is such a game changer for this mom of 5. Sometimes I need a noise break, if you know what I mean. The sound quality, noise cancellation and deep beat help me escape. Whether I’m at the gym, making dinner, or listening to my favorite book or podcast. I can we wire free and in my own world. My phone can be on the counter or in the next room. But it doesn’t have to be on my hip and my back pocket.  They were so easy to hook up I popped in the case, changed the ends to fit my ears, popped them in mud ears, found them in my Bluetooth setting and in less than a minute I was enjoying a musical escape. Aaaand they have a 1 year extended warranty and easy to find customer service info. Game changer is an understatement.",5,1,2020-3-9,1,1,1

I mostly listen to audio books while doing yard work, or other projects around the house.These ear buds have great sound and if anything they can be a bit too loud, but that's not a problem.

"I was previously using the ENACFIRE E18 Earbuds for the past couple of years.  I bought these to have a second pair I could keep at my office.  They are great.  Sound quality is improved over my previous pair....these are much louder!  Don't have to keep the volume on max for these.  For me, one tragic flaw.  These have a tiny blue light on each bud that blinks every few seconds when they are in use.  If you use these in the dark (listening in bed, etc.), the tiny light is not so tiny.  You get an annoying flash of light from each side every few seconds.  I can't think of any good reason why there would be a benefit to have a flashing light.  Even in light, it just calls attention to the fact that you have earbuds in.  Bad design idea.  Guess this new pair will be my ""office pair"", since I can't use them in bed.",4,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"Really impressed with these so far. I am an avid gym goer and really prefer the earbud for working out. No wires is just such a perk when it comes to all the movement I'm doing.So far the sound is really good, does a decent job of cancelling.

"I primarily use earbuds for listening to music while running and working out.  First time buyer of wireless earbuds so I was apprehensive as to sound quality and I was seeking a product that remained stable in my ear while working out .  I have always used wired earbuds prior to this purchase.  My standard $30 dollar wired earbuds would last a couple of years before wires would ultimately break and loose sound in one of the ear buds.  Another issue with wired earbuds was the cords would eventually pull on the earbuds requiring readjustment to add slack to the cords and then press back in the earbuds.I ended up purchasing the Tozo T10s given its features, reviews, and reasonable price.  1) I didn't want to have to worry about water or sweat impacting the earbuds. Given these have a waterproof rating of IPX8, I feel confident in not having to worry about them getting soaked.  2) Sound quality exceeded my expectations for price level - very clean tones with good base.  Volume level capacity is great given it will go louder than what I need even though I've had slight hearing loss through the years. 3)  Stability of staying put in my ears during running is very good.  No more cords pulling on the earbuds!  These are more bulky than my wired earbuds but they are fairly light in weight.  I encountered no issues with them coming unseated from my ear canals during 30 minute runs.  Occasionally, I will slightly press on them to adjust the seal pressure in the ear.  I love the freedom of having no cords!  Glad I chose to go with these over wireless earbuds that are joined by a cord that wraps around the neck.  Coworker mentioned cords on his wireless earbuds do become unbalanced and will pull on his earbuds when running. 4) Battery life is good - more than adequate for getting me through a couple hours of workout at the gym.  Love that the charging base has an internal battery that can recharge the earbuds several times when away from any plugins.",5,1,2019-1-23,1,2,0

"I was so excited for these wireless earbuds. The packaging is beautiful and I love the little charging box. However, I’m returning them because they don’t stay in my ear. I tried every size bud and it falls out as soon as I move which makes it pointless. I have been trying for three days now and my ear is actually sore from trying to get them to lodge in there. They do fit my fiancé perfectly and he happens to love them. If you have a bigger ear for them to fit, then go for it",4,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0
"I've been trying to replace my old earphones (true wireless) for the past couple of months. I've been researching, reading specifications and reviews of earphones including this one. My ""deal breaker"" requirements were: 1) Sound quality for music and audiobook and podcast, 2) Phone call quality, and 3) The ability to use only one ear phone at a time (either right side or left side). I picked TOZO 10 (I've been using it for the last 2 weeks) because it checked all three requirements and then some. I'm happy with my purchase and the quality of the product. The sounds is AMAZING, the phone call is laud and clear; they can hear my voice clearly and I can hear them loud and clear. The capability of the charging box being charged wirelessly is a plus. The only things I wish were better, are the battery life and the distance it operates away from the phone. it starts to break up if I walk away from my office to the kitchen at work. my old one worked perfectly. Other than that, TOZO 10 is a great earphone.",4,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
"I can’t do AirPods . Not only do they not fit, but every time I see someone with AirPods I’m reminded of the scene in There’s Something About Mary where he has... well... “stuff “ dripping from his ear.I bought these based on the reviews and how they look.

"I attempted to return the product but due to a family member being ill with COVID, having to care for them, and having to quarantine myself, ran out of time. The headphones completely quit working after less than five uses; the battery fully charged ran for maybe 5 hours; when I'd use them to speak on the phone, the person I'd be speaking with would hear more of the background noise than they would hear me. The sound quality was fine when listening to them but I needed them to speak to clients on phone calls. They would randomly unpair from my phone or computer which would cause my phone to hang up. I do not recommend.",1,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"I spent more than $150 on wireless earbuds that did not fit well and/or sounded “weird” so I set my hopes accordingly. The first thing I noticed was that half the manual was dedicated to a detailed description on how to fit the device in the ear. They get it I thought. I will forgive missing functionality and or high sound quality for a good fit. I followed the detailed instruction and - a miracle, the units fit perfectly into their place. And the sound and isolation where better than all other wireless earbuds I tried. The connection to the device is seamless and consistent. The earbuds and the charger/battery have a clean and beautiful design. You can tell that they are maid with high quality material. The units snap into their slots in the charger.  The LEDs are clear and noticeable. The earbuds fit in and stay there. I tested that at the Gym and in long walks. I sweat a lot but while other devices stopped working these buds were not affected. Yes, you can’t control the volume from the buds but this is a really small detail compared to the fact that finally I have earbuds that perfectly fit and sound great. I will happily recommend the product.",5,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"First off, they're light and compact. They come with several earbud sizes (standard practice I know) and I found the small ones fit nice and snug in my ear canal. They appear to be watertight and sealed, time will tell of course but first impressions are these will not succumb to sweaty workouts any time soon.I also tried them out on my motorcycle last weekend, and they fit comfortably inside my helmet. Very good sound on the open highway. I would note though that the headphones do not fit flush against my ear (understandable) so they do get pulled out when taking my helmet off. That's a small gripe though overall.",5,1,2019-5-21,1,0,0
"So I wanted desperately to be able to give these a 5 star. And I would have if it wasn't for the bit of lag you get between the moving mouths in the video and then the actual words you hear in the ear buds. It's minor - and if you're exercising and not focusing on the screen, you won't notice. But if you're on a treadmill and you're watching TV to distract because let's face it, us normal people are dying while we're exercising and that tiny screen is the only bit of distracting I have from sheer passing out - it's hard to stay focused on living when I can see the lips moving then hear the sound seconds later. So I wish I could figure it out - I wish I could have a pair that works maybe better. Because then I would so give these a 5 star because they sound amazing and fit perfectly. Best fit of a pair of ear buds ever. And I LOVE the look. :(",4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"I've been using these headphones for about 8 months. Overall, they are a great product. The sound quality is excellent. I really like how quickly they connect to your device once taken out of the case. The various sizes of ear pieces is the really winner here. I can't use Apple brand headphones/air pods. They are too large for my ears and cause great discomfort. With these, I can use the smallest ear pieces and they fit comfortably and are still great for noise cancellation. These are comfortable enough to sleep in and have never slipped once during my runs.I did begin to have some issues with the headphones powering on while still in the charging case after several months of use. I worked with support to resolve the problem. TOZO support was very quick, even in light of the time difference, and I always had a response waiting for me in the morning.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,1,0
"Got a recommendation from my daughter to purchase these buds. She loves them and puts them to use while walking the dog, cycling, gardening, etc. When I saw that I could buy them on sale, I thought that I'd give them a try. For the price, they sound great, come with a convenient charging/storage case and a multiple assortment of silicone ear-tips. I've used them a few times and like them except . . . they don't fit my ear well. I've tried using the different size ear-tips provided with no success. Either I have to jam them uncomfortably deep into my ear, or they fall out during minimal activity. Consequently, I mostly use them while sitting, or relaxing.Again, my daughter loves them and even I have to admit, that for the price, they provide good quality sound. Perhaps I have unusually shaped ear canals?",4,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0

I am very happy with my purchase and already ordered another one that’s arriving tomorrow for another family member! Great price for the quality and love that it comes with a 1 year warranty as well.

They were almost fully charged and it only took less than a minute to pair with my phone and the sound was amazing. The ability to have both earbuds on at the same time with the right one in control is great, and when I just place the buds in the box they are not longer connected. I also liked the box, small and wireless charging abilities, it makes it easy to charge and make sure you never have the box which is a charging battery never empty. For now I like the units and will say great accept the battery life is only about 3-4 hours in my use.

"I love these ear buds! I had been wanting a pair of completely wireless earbuds after trying a friend's much-more-expensive-brand earbuds and loved the concept. However, I did not want to spend that much. This pair is very affordable and has a high quality of sound. The earbud itself is very comfortable and, when my music is paused, I sometimes forget they're even there.The reason that these aren't a full 5 stars for me is because the sizes of earbud covers they provided were not good for me. I have small ears, and even the smallest size they provided was too big. Luckily, I had an older pair of earbuds with the correct size for me and they were able to be attached to this pair. Given this, my only suggestion to the retailer would be to consider providing an extra-small earbud cover, since I've seen other reviewers with the same problem as me. Once I had the correct covers, it was smooth sailing.",4,1,2019-11-6,1,1,0

"I love my new earbuds. I typically have a hard time finding earbuds that don't make my ears hurt from being too big, but these are perfect! I've worn them for hours without any pain. I am able to listen to my podcasts while cleaning and I don't have to disturb anyone else either. The battery life on these is also great! The bluetooth earbuds that these are replacing needed to be charged every 2 hours. These last through a whole day of deep cleaning and still have some juice left for a morning run! I could only give 4 stars for noise cancellation because while it's fairly hard to hear anything else when you have these on its still possible so they are not completely noise cancelling, but that's such a small thing to harp on unless that was the key selling point for you. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase. I also want to buy more so I can always have a pair with me at work at home in my bag. I really love them.",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
I bought these to use with Zoom meetings to have wireless headphones with a mic in them. This mic is absolutely terrible. The sound is  muffled and is also delayed when you watch the recorded video later. It sounds like I’m talking on an old rotary phone. There is also static when paired with my computer. I’ve tried recording with voice memo on my iPhone to see if it was any better and the mic quality is still noticeably bad. Will be returning.

I’m guessing interference from wifi and Bluetooth nearby.Swimming with them is a bit of a joke. The right side went out half way through my 15 min laps swim. Then came back faintly near the end. To start the left side was in and out because I breath on my right. If they’re under the surface of the water they won’t work. Then they both went out and turned off when I floated 3 seconds. I turned them back on, but the music wouldn’t play. So they disconnected because they both were underwater at the same time. They don’t float.",3,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0

If you push them down into your ears, the bass is excellent (if you just lightly put them in, you won't hear much bass at all, which is typical for ear buds).The microphone performs well for phone calls, but in any place other than a silent room, I find it necessary to take the right earbud out of my ear and hold it in front of my mouth.

"I think they're pretty solid headphones especially for the price. I'm a landscaper and I listen to audible's all day while I Garden. The battery always lasts til lunch and then I put them back in their little charging case which fits really well in my fanny pack and then they're ready to go for the rest of the day. At first I had trouble putting them in my ears but if you look through the reviews will find that there's a specific way to put them in your ears so that they won't fall out. The noise on them is pretty loud and clear, sometimes the audio will drop out but I honestly think it's because I have a crappy phone with Bluetooth that's not that strong and even then it only happens maybe 3 times a day. You can click once to pause and if you click twice it'll call the last person in your contacts which I don't think I'll ever actually use but it definitely gives me a heart attack when I accidentally call people. I have used them somtimes to call people when I'm doing stuff with my hands and they work better than the speaker on my phone and people on the other end of the line can hear me clearly. I got the black and noticed some of the paint chipping off of the side of them but I use them everyday and it isn't a problem especially with the black because when it chips away there's black underneath. I ended up accidentally putting them in the wash and they didn't work anymore and I haven't used the warranty and when I looked again at your buds the seem to be the best to buy so I got them again.",4,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0

Do yourself a favor and buy these Bluetooth earbuds before they run out or before the price increases, you won’t be sorry.  Excellent seller too!",5,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0
I purchased these after buying a pair for my wife.  I tried hers and immediately liked the sound quality.  When I received them and started using them they worked good.  After about a week I started to notice them periodically cutting out but not bad and it really didn’t bother me.  After a while they started doing it more frequently so I went through the troubleshooting steps on the website.  This didn’t seem to help so I contacted the company.  They gave me steps to try but nothing worked so they offered to send me A new set. When the new ones arrived they worked perfectly and have been flawless.  I understand there will always be defects it’s just the reality of manufacturing products but Tozo stood behind their product and that holds a lot of value to me.  I know several people who have purchased these and everyone of them have been very satisfied.,5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"I love these earbuds. I'd recommend them to anybody who is looking for solid sound quality and noise cancellation but prioritizes durability for heavy use (such as university students like myself).Recently my Jaybirds died on me; I had used them for 3+ years for listening to music when I walk to class and exercise, cancel out noise when I sleep, and make calls. I was looking for something that could last me a while at this level of heavy use while providing good noise cancellation and decent quality.",5,1,2019-10-14,1,1,0
"These are amazing! I've been wanting some bluetooth earbuds for a while. I'd been seeing a ridiculous amount of ads on Youtube for Raycons but I didn't want to drop $80 in case I didn't like them. I'm so glad I found these!I use these mostly for when I'm out running errands and grocery shopping. When you connect these you have to connect the right side first, it is the main connection to your phone. Then the left will connect afterward. So if you only want to use one, it has to be the right and not the left. Sometimes if you've had the right connected for a while and then take the left out of the case it wont connect properly but just disconnect from bluetooth, put both back in the case, and then reconnect them as usual and you're good to go!",5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
I am updating my review for this product. It has come to my attention that the ear buds may have been defective .This doesn't represent the quality of the products as a whole.,5,1,2019-12-28,1,1,0
"I just unboxed these tonight and wow ... The sound is great! The base is awesome! I haven't tested battery life or noise cancelling. It comes with 4 different sizes of plugs (I have no clue what they are really called) so that you can find the perfect fit for your ears. My ears are smaller and Apple products hurt my ears over time, so I am thankful for the variety in sizes. The price is great and so is the sound! The box is packaged nicely, and the instructions are easy to follow. It came with a lanyard, but there are no instructions on how to thread it, but trial and error will help you get it right. Will update if I find any issues.",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"Not a fan of these headphones. The audio quality is far below what I would expect from $30 headphones much less at $50. The charging is case is bulky and not easily pocketable. There is a lot of phantom drain from the headphones which means you have to keep charging them even if you don’t use them. It’s also impossible to just use one without the annoying beeping that keeps overriding the music.Additionally, registering warranty may have resulted in email spam. I have not given one of my email addresses anywhere, but after registering my warranty, I started receiving a lot of spam.",1,1,2019-10-30,1,1,0
"Sound quality is relatively good. I have always had a problem with the left (slave) ear cutting in and out. Then it will play for a period at a much lower volume than the right. Other times it just stops playing, then surprises you by tripping in every now and then.If the left ear would play consistently, I would be a happy customer. There are no issues with the right side. It connects via Bluetooth and plays until I turn if off.",3,1,2019-9-4,1,1,0
"I really enjoy using these buds. I use them when I practice basketball or on walks with the dogs. Heavy bass, which I like, easy to pair, which I also like. Had a little issue with the left bud but it is because when I originally paired them with my phones bluetooth I clicked on the left ear bud. DON'T CLICK ON THE ONE WITH THE L. They automatically sync with you pair the right bud with you phone. Do that and you'll be fine.Great for hip hop and metal bands like As I Lie Dying. They sound the best when played with Rage Against the Machine.",4,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
Haven’t used long enough but the setup was super easy. Sound is okay although I’m used to Comfy over the ears noise cancelling bose so I have to lower my standards for the price  Pretty comfortable as i just can’t do AirPods they hurt my ears. These come with three different sizes. My ears I guess are big as they came with small ones and they fell right out. Kind of weird as i don’t hunk my ears are big. Lol. The charging case is great.  I bought them to ride my horses and have music and still wear my helmet.  I’ll prob loose them so I won’t feel as bad as the price is pretty reasonable.  I don’t think these are nose cancelled version.  Have no clue if you can answer the phone from them.,4,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"These headphones have superb bass sound. I knew it said they did, but when I turned them on the first time, I was blown away. I didn't expect them to have near what they did. I've tried at least five different earphones/earbuds and none (not even the Apple pair that came with an iPhone and was ruined after going through the washer) had near as good as bass. The only problem is my phone. It recently started pairing all Bluetooth devices as [name unknown]. Also, I'm not sure if it's my phone or the earbuds, the left earbud will cut out every five seconds sometimes. This only happens every once in a while and I found that pausing the music with the earbuds, waiting about three seconds, and then playing the music again will stop the cutting out. One theory I have is that my phone has version 3.0 Bluetooth and these earbuds have version 5.0. But overall, these earbuds are very durable, waterproof (unlike the Apple ones), and have superb bass. To use them is also very simple. Once they are paired with your phone, simply turn them both on, (or take them out of the charging case, they turn on automatically) let them connect with each other, and then the right earbud will connect with your phone. Then let bass rumble! You can also use just one of the earbuds if you want too, although you don't as good of sound. When I use these earbuds, I turn the volume on my phone clear down to 1 as the buds are quite loud and cancel sound very well. With the volume on 1 in a quiet room, I can't hear a person talking to me from three feet away AT ALL. This also saves your phone battery as it doesn't have to create as strong of a signal. I do wish they wouldn't cut out though. Also, the case won't take a charge from most charging cables, however, it works with some cables. Still, the seller is so nice, he's going to send me a free wireless charger. By the way, he offered to send me one before I told him my case wouldn't charge. That's what you call customer service! It came the other day. It's worth $20. And they sent it completely free. Works awesome, the only down thing is, my phone doesn't support wireless charging. :) Altogether, they get a five-star rating.",5,1,2019-1-23,1,1,1
"My first set of bluetooth buds since they first came out years ago. I paid half as much as I did then. I got 2 ear buds instead of one. And they charge wirelessly.These buds are state of the art devices. Small, lightweight, and comfortable. The sound is absolutely amazing. They even give the feel of good base in music and games.",5,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
"Sound quality is fine. I use it mostly for Zooming and have better quality buds for music-listening. They connect to bluetooth pretty quickly and reliably.I charge it overnight and consistently get ~3 hours before it turns off, which is disappointing, but it's advertised that it ""can"" last 4 hours. Not that it ""will."" Confused about the ""extra 14 hour"" with charging case claim, because I definitely haven't exceeded 3 hours' charge.",4,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0
"For the price point these things are great.  I can't see paying so much more for the apple product.  Sound quality is very good and they seem to hold a charge nicely.  Couple of quirks. Took a little while to figure out how to get them to fit snug, but after some trial and error I got them in good and they stay in while jogging.  One thing that is concerning.  Twice I pulled them out and the rubber ear bud came off and stayed in my ear.  I was able to pull the bud out but I can see someone getting that thing logged in their ear.  Also the charging case is cool and weird at the same time.  Nice case but it doesn't really have an off button, you just stick them in and it charges regardless if you want them to or not.",3,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"These headphones lasted 45 days. The left earbud did not fit well into my ear, even after I tried the different sizes. I wore them despite that because the sound was decent, and I just had to adjust the left ear bud every once in a while. (In hindsight, I just should have returned them.) Then I was walking through the house when it fell out onto the floor and stopped working. The only good thing was that it was the left one that dropped and not the right, because the right functions independently while the left one does not. Would not recommend these earbuds if there's a chance you might drop one at some point.",3,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"I had been very happy with my Soundpeats earbuds for a year or so, but after I dropped them a couple of times, the two buds wouldn't pair, and also there was additional noise coming from the left earbud. I didn't want to spend more than $30-40, so after doing some research, I decided to buy these TOZOs.First, the pros:",3,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"These sound great.  I use them at night when people are sleeping connected to the TV or cellphone.  Words great indoors.  My TV is pretty far away from the couch and these work great.  I bought a total of 3 of these because they work well with kids on their devices indoors so I don't have to hear them.  Also the kids use them on car rides in the back seat for watching videos.  They work great.Now outdoors and PC/Laptops is where they have problems.  I connect these to PC/Laptops and they crash the sound drivers.  I have some AT m50x Bluetooth and I can connect just fine with them on my PC/Laptop, so I think its just the TOZO's.  Also when I go outside for walking the dogs and running/jogging they seem to cut in and out like I am on a old CD walkman without antishock.  Its weird, but the only solution I found is keep it near the left side of your body, either being in the left hand or back left pocket.  Seems to work fine then.  Looking at getting a forearm strap for my phone so I can keep it closer without holding my phone.",4,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0
"These wireless buds are great. I have been looking for a pair of wireless beds for a while and found these TOZO wireless buds, discounted to $30, right around Black Friday 2019. I am an Apple user. I have the iPhone 11. I purchased AirPods for 1 of my kids about 4 months back, and after listening with those, I really wanted a pair for myself, but didn’t want to pay $150-250 for them. After reading an online article and many reviews, I decided to pull the trigger on the TOZOs, and I’m glad I did.I am happy with them as an all-around product, but the most impressive thing is the sound quality. I can throw these in directly from the charging case when I am about to go for a run, or before I start cooking, and KNOW 100% that they are going to connect on their own. There is less to do than a with a normal Bluetooth speaker. They connect seamlessly, have a Really good range and battery life, and if you find the right sized buds, they are comfortable and stay put. They don’t move during workouts.",5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"I bought these to replace the Jaybird Vistas that I had lost. Those headphones were almost perfect, with the exception of sub par tracking capabilities.These headphones are equal to those headphones for about 1/5 the cost.",4,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"These earbuds worked as advertised for maybe the first time I used them. No problems connecting, plenty of bass, but the trebels sounded strange. No biggie, I just wanted these to follow along to peloton videos while I worked out. The problems showed up the second time I used them and have only gotten worse. The big problem is connectivity issues. From the minute I turn them on both earbuds will constantly cut in and out, making the listening experience jarring and annoying. Very rarely will audio even play on both earbuds, usually you're on either the left or right, which changes pretty quickly as well. Another one is that I can't get these to seat right on my ears. One ear is usually fine while the other is super loose and is prone to falling out. That's probably more dude to my ear shape than anything else but it's still super annoying. I wanted to give these a fair shot, I really did, but since it's clear the connectivity problem isn't going away I'm just going to throw them out. Do not buy these, look somewhere else.PS: it seems my order has been marked as ""delayed"" for quite some time now. Usually I wouldn't make anything of this but I have noticed this prevents me from requesting a refund. Something to keep in mind when you make your purchases.",1,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
I liked the product until it would not hold a charge after 9 months of limited use.  I will replace this with a different brand.23 Sept 2020 Update: the company offered a replacement or a $40 amazon gift card. I asked for the card since I replaced the product.  But it turns out I only get the gift IF I updated this review FIRST.  THEY wanted a POSITIVE (more stars) update.  So THIS IS the update.,3,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"Received them, opened up the box, looks like I was expecting.  Then I tried them on, or attempted to.  Couldn't get them to fit right, not even close.  Tried all of the earpiece sizes, tried rotating them per the instructions (and instructional videos) to no avail.  I contacted TOZO, they responded within 12 hours, and sent a link to a video for making sure I was getting the proper fit.  I did what they indicated.  The problem being that my ears are too small to get the earbuds in deep enough to lock them in.  If you have small ears, be aware that these may not be right for you.Amazon and Tozo customer service were responsive and helpful.",3,1,2019-3-25,1,3,0
"These are excellent quality wireless ear buds. When I got them, I also got the extended warranty. It comes as a card with them so you just use a QR scanner.

Finally wireless blue tooth earbuds that have excellent sound and seem to be top quality for the price.  I have shopped and shopped for weeks and feel so very fortunate to have found these little treasures.  So easy to pair with my smartphone and right away I could hear beautiful crisp sound.  And my calls are crystal clear too.  I use these earbuds at work to help me decrease my stress while I concentrate on my projects.  I usually work 2 hours at a time and the battery seems to last a little past that time.  Everything feels so sturdy and expensive.  The only issue I have is the USB cord that came with the unit didn't fit and I had the darn-est time trying to open the USB charger port.  With some real effort I finally opened it.  I was offered the free wireless charger sent to my home by customer service.  Great service and support.  Great purchase and warranty.,5,1,2019-5-13,1,0,1
"I got these earlier today and fully charged them before trying. These are the first buds i’ve found that fit without a titanic struggle. They paired with each other and my iPhone 8 immediately. However, the left earbud keeps cutting out. I’ve turned them off and then on several times, “forgotten” them and re-paired them several times in the Bluetooth phone setting, and read several “fixes” in the comments section on Amazon. Nothing works. The left earbud cuts out after every fix, with the phone within 12 inches of the buds. I gave “battery” 3 stars because I don’t really know how well it holds charge, and the sound quality 4 stars because they sound good. Noise canceling was nonexistent.",2,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
"I have used the T10 now for couple months... everything works awesome for these when they work... not sure if mine are defective or this is normal. I have troubles syncing both together sometimes, right one will connect, then the left one connects knocking out the right connection out and vice versa, it will do this back and forth regardless of how many times I do it.... only thing I do is put both back in case and bring both out again to correct. Another thing is, if I place or lean my head in my left hand cupping my ear, this causes the link between the two to break and the left piece stops playing until I move my hand away. I wish I would of opted for the T6, maybe newer version fixed these issues.",3,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"I love this earphones.  Working alone and with no stimulation, time becomes dull.  I was listening to some audiobooks, but at times, the noise of moving boxes around the freezer was shutingoff the serene voice coming out of the smartphone.  Then I was observing that my younger coworkers had some white device in their ears.  They told me that cost them $170!Well, I searched for wireless earphones in my favorite omnichannel:Amazon.  I saw the reviews.  And I have to say that I saw the bad reviews.  Before ordering I read one review about the earphones not working... but the customer service was great...  I guess that made me decide to order them.  I received them and I m listening to many audiobooks while working.  I love them!",5,1,2019-8-16,1,0,0
"I am absolutely amazed with my new T10s.  I've had LG HBS headsets for over four years because the true wireless devices were of cheap quality in manufacturing and sound in the past.  After bad experiences with my LGs I took a chance and researched the best TWS earbuds to date.  Tozo T10 was the model that stood out!  I received it in less time than advertised.  First impression was positive.  Quality packaging, instructions, feel and sound.  Pairing was very simple.  While playing music from my contemporary jazz library I could hear all the notes from all instruments clearly.  The sound wasn't overbearing and the bass was on target too.  One of the selling points was the wireless charging case.  Keep up the good work.  You are very competitive to Apple's Airpods in price and quality.",5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0

I’ll stick with corded headphones.EDIT: The company saw my review and suggested that I received a defective pair, and offered to send me a free pair of the updated model.

"Ok so initially I loved the earbuds since I always had wired earbuds. I loved the sound but I am not an expert in that type of thing. The earbuds themselves were bulky and hurt my ears a bit but I expected it since my ears were small. The main problem I had was when I noticed that the earbuds died seemingly quicker than I expected. It claims that the earbuds can give 4 hours of playtime on a single charge. It did not feel like 4 hours to me so I recorded the time it took for the earbuds to die. It turned out to be approximately 2 hrs and 43 mins (give or take some seconds). I attempted this multiple times just to see if it was a charging problem (I let it stay in the charger for a day, I turned off the earbuds immediately before charging) but I still got the same problem. I'm still keeping it though since I have no way of returning it (I have no printer and the post office was a town over but I can't drive).",3,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"I just received my new T10 wireless earbuds and I love them. They are the most comfortable earbuds I’ve ever worn as I have small ear canals and fit is usually rough. The smallest covers were perfect for me. I love how the case feels very secure when shut. My husband has a set that were much more expensive, and the said the case for the T10 has a stronger magnet. I was happy to get them in white - a lot easier to find white on the inside of my black laptop bag than gray. The sound is fantastic and although I haven’t made a phone call with them yet, I feel confident they’ll work great. I felt confident in ordering these based on the reviews here on Amazon, and I’m glad I did. Highly recommended.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"Maybe they sent me a low-quality thing. On the first day of use, I noticed that: 1) the sound is not high quality as in the description. (I will not describe - for this price you can get used to such a sound). 2) It is indicated in the description of more than 4 hours of operation of the headphones - mine worked only 3 hours at a low volume). 3) Indicated in the description up to 14 hours of operation at charging from the charging case ... - after the first discharge, I charged the headphones (1 hour for this), after that the charging case was discharged, and the headphones worked for another 3 hours. The description is not correct - not 14 hours, only 6 hours!",3,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"The sound quality is excellent. And these things charge FAST. I love that I can use a charging pad as well as plugging it in to charge. The case is well-made, and the buds are comfortable. These were easy to pair with my phone. Am unable to pair them with my amazon Fire Tablet, but have been unsuccessful with other bluetooth earbuds as well; so I think it is the fault of the TABLET, not the earbuds. Just mentioning this in case anyone is hoping to pair these earbuds to a fire tablet. Both of my tablets are under a year old, so it should work.  Again, NOT the fault of these earbuds. I am happy with my purchase.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"So I just got these yesterday, but what I noticed immediately was the sound quality.  I literally only had my volume turned up by *1* and the sound was clear, and louder than expected.  For that, I love them more than my regular ""plug in"" headphones.  I have to use the smallest earbud pieces, but they fit nice in my ears and don't feel like their falling out of my ears.  My true test with that will be running, as I really got these for running, but with the way they feel I'm thinking that won't be an issue.  For now I can't speak to any battery life, but they were super easy to pair to my phone, and the case they go into for charging is quite sturdy.  I can toss it into my gym bag or purse without worry.  When you put the earbuds into the charging case, it's magnetic, so they plop right in and stay put.  For now, I'm definitely impressed with these!!",5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"I bought a different set of wireless earbuds: the sound quality was pretty bad and after 5 weeks they stopped pairing together and became individual devices, so you couldn't listen to music.

First of all, I am so impressed by the sound quality, the deep bass, and the punchiness these earphones have.A lot of other wireless earbuds don't offer much bass and their volume normally is weak due to the small size of the audio driver. But Tozo T10 comes with an 8mm driver and you could definitely feel the difference!",5,1,2019-4-1,1,2,0
"I’ve never had Bluetooth headphones until I bought these ones.  I bought a watch and needed Bluetooth headphones for it.  It was hard finding a decent pair at an affordable price especially not knowing if the earbuds are going to be comfortable in your ears.  I don’t like at first that they are a little bulky, but you get used to it.  I only use one earbud at a time when I go running, so if you only turn one earbud on it will beep the first couple of minutes (very quietly and not constantly the first couple of minutes) because it wants to pair with the earbud.  The earbud stays in place pretty good, especially if you’re running.  I like how it comes with a charging case and haven’t had to charge them that much yet, but I’ve only used them a few times so far.  I’ve only had them for a week now, but the sound is really good.  If you can get over the minor flaws then I think this is a good purchase.",5,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0
"I have Apple air pods. I purchased these because now that the gym has opened back the pool, I am back in it, water walking and doing water aerobics but without a class.  So I wanted music.  I needed water proof earbuds.  I did not want to pay a lot of money and everyone said to get the beats.  I also did not want corded buds.  I have bought inexpensive blue-tooth cordless ear buds before after I lost my first pair of Apple air pods and did not want to pay to replace them.  Everything I tried were crap.  So for <$40 I was not expected anything great.  I am truly blown away.  I like them better then my Apple Air-pods generation 2.  I have never had a blue tooth headset connect seamlessly to my iphone and ipad.  The sound quality was great and the range from the device to wear I could be was really good.  I was walking all around my 1700 sq ft house.  I also left my phone on the side of the pool and was all over  the pool with no issues.  I have not submerged the head set like doing laps yet.

"Used these to listen to music for 25 minutes a day several times a week on a morning walk, lasted roughly one year, then this morning the left piece just stopped working. Though that sounds like a decent amount of time, this is all I used them for, which put my usage at ~125 hours before they failed.I admit that I should have returned them right off the bat, as they never paired properly, but I just dealt with it. Had to manually pair them about 50% of the time. Oftentimes, only one would pair and then I would have to turn them both off then back on to re-initiate the pair. Although I carried my phone with me, I think it's also important to note that the range on the connection also appears to be very poor at around 15-ish feet, with no barriers.",1,1,2020-8-27,1,1,0
"First I will say these do what I need them to do: last long enough to keep me happy while I mow the lawn or exercise. The fit is sufficiently tight so they don't fall out in either instance.Couple of issues I have with them. The battery life of the pod seems almost non-existent. No matter how long I use the buds, the charger never shows it has battery left and I need to plug it in. As a result, I don't trust it enough to take with me on trips.",4,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0

I simply wanted something that sounded good, good highs and good lows.",5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0

I was really impressed by their offer, and hope these new ones do better.First let me say that pairing these with my Android phone was easy, I just followed the steps in the guide. The sound quality is also terrific. These are my first pair of Bluetooth ear buds, and I bought them specifically so that I can be wireless when walking my dog with my phone in my pocket. But it seems that when my phone is in my pocket, the audio cuts in and out regularly. When I hold the phone in my hand, or if it's sitting on my desk at work, the issue disappears.

"I absolutely love these. As an audiophile I was really nervous about the sound quality of wireless earbuds since I didn't think the bass would come through as well as I wanted. These deliver very deep and solid bass. Make sure you use the right sized ear piece for your ear to make sure you have complete isolation of air. Boomy bass, nice sharp and clean highs with a warm mid range. Battery life lasts longer than I need and I've never run out of juice. I listen to music, podcasts and more while working and these have been fantastic. I really bought them because I was so tired of wired buds getting in my way while lifting, getting snagged on coats and jackets or tangled up in my seatbelt. Can't recommend these enough.It did take me a couple tries to get the hang of how the Bluetooth pairs but now it's second nature.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,1,0

They are comfortable to wear while laying in bed. They are as waterproof as I need them to be, having taken them into both the shower and the pool with no issues. I do not have any issues with them cutting out, as others have reported. Following the instructions of the manufacturer, connection to each other, and then to my devices was quick and easy. My biggest issue is if I want to use just one, the other one cannot be placed back on the charger, as the Bluetooth signal between earbuds is disconnected, but I can still use just one as long as I store the other outside of the charger...no big deal. And like I said, considering these little things, they still work better than anything else I've tried, even those costing more money.",4,1,2019-2-24,1,0,0
"The order arrived on time and works well. The pairing was simple and immediate. The pairing is the only issue I have with the buds. The sound quality is great and better than any buds I have bought. The last ones I have were on the previous version of Bluetooth and the difference is noticeable. The volume, bass, and sound quality are improved. I use in meetings with large groups via MS Teams and Zoom. No issue other than Bluetooth software sometimes encounters issues going from one application to other (i.e., going from music being stream via a Internet platform to a meeting in Zoom. Bluetooth sometimes take a few seconds when going between applications.The only issue I have is the  using one bud at a time. It often times stops playing when I use only the Left bud (slave). I have repair them to each other sometimes then use one of the buds. This is mitigated somewhat IF you pair the buds separately to a device you can use them in single mode. It should be easy just to pick up one bud and use it without you have to go through troubleshooting steps to get it to work where music/voice is going through one bud. Outside of this it is a good purchase and product.",5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"I am a runner and honestly pretty hard on on my equipment.  Running in the rain, heat, and freezing weather will chew through shoes, headphones, and smart watches pretty quickly.  I have used a pair of Bose Sound Sports for several years now and had to replace them 3 times.  These were always under warranty, but most recently after getting my new Soundsports back, they were overheating and failing in less than a week.I was not excited to drop another 150-200 dollars on headphones, so I decided to give these Tozo T10 wireless buds a try.",4,1,2019-8-13,1,1,1
"These little guys provide a great sound that rivals the premium stereo package in my beloved car!  With the stellar (yet unexpected) bass I can have my own personal party!  Best thing about this dudes is they charge up quick, eliminate background sounds, and no one can hear what I’m listening to!  Only con would be that if the sound is turned way up the buds die faster than normal but it’s okay cause 1) I had the sound way up so obvii battery life won’t be as long and 2) The provided charger case will allow you to jam out again in a matter of minutes!  These were originally a gift given to myself but then my mom bought the same ones after I kept talking about them and then the gift giver got their own pair as well!!  Ha!",5,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
"I really like the size and fit, very comfortable and light weight. Some first thoughts were it didn't have that bass/woofer sound and it wasn't noise cancelling either BUT THEN I changed the earbuds and was BLOWN AWAY! I hate earbuds that have too much tweet or high treble (cause headaches) but was easily resolved by switching the earbud fit. The bass is really good especially on the Magnolia Playboi Carti song test song. I mainly listen to deep house and Anjunadeep was prime. Only thing I wish was longer battery life (for work) but this will be perfect for exercise! Buy them. Toally worth the $40. If you toss them in the laundry, let them air dry or if sandy from the beach, rinse. They're waterproof, not water resistant.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"I am satisfied with the performance of these. The bass was hard to dial in but that was more of an issue with my phone. After some adjustments they hit as well as you can expect for budget earbuds. Range of connection at 10m is accurate, so don't try to move too far from your audio source.  The dock is nicely designed, I appreciate the magnetic clasps. The auto pair function is great for grab and go use if you aren't spread across multiple bluetooth devices. Battery life to be determined however the 3 hr charged time seems accurate. At low volume it may be better, I have yet to run them dry in a single marathon use. I am impressed enough I may purchase the ""super bass"" version of these as well.",5,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"I used these 5 times and each time theyhadtrouble pairing with my new LG V60 phone.  Perhaps it didn't like the 5G technology and perhaps that is unrelated.  Once both buds paired but most often only the left or only the right bud would pair. This was very frustrating and why I am returning them.The one time I got both to pair, there was no sound coming out of the right bud.",2,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
I am disappointed. I tried every ear bud cap size that came with them and they all fall out of ear. I went around my house and gathered every cap off every wired earbuds I have and still nothing worked. It is the design of the earbuds. Noones ears are straight they are curved therefore the earbuds should be curved. As far as pairing very very easy!  As far as sound slightly disappointed as  it doesnt seem to be that loud. It does sound good though. I keep wanting to go to phone to increase volume but high as it will go. I went by reviews when purchasing and honestly I am surprised on the reviews because there is no way these fit good for the majority of people. Especially small ears and there is no way you can exercise with these shape of ear buds. They would not stay snug at all. Now I have to go searching once again for the perfect fitting ear buds.,3,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"Overall for the price you're paying they are well worth the money. These are the same price as a different brand that I bought for myself (I got 2 of these for my father and brother), and these are definitely better quality. Mine fall out of my ears and when I push them in they pause my music, or tv show (whatever I am watching). However these have a slim, deeper fitting to your ear canal and really gives you that quality isolated sound boost without the discomfort! Great sound quality, good range from the paired device, and has a wonderful microphone quality no matter what room your paired device is in. My father and brother absolutely love these, and I might just switch mine out for these as well! Great buy, and would definitely purchase again!",5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"I bought these mostly for the wireless charging aspect. It's a very nice case. The headphones themselves are very well built, but they are a bit clunky in size compared to others. They do come with several difference size ear cups. Be sure to use the correct size so you get the best sound and can keep them in your ears.Functionally they connect quickly. You can use them independently, but the right headohone is the ""main"" headphone. Connect that one first if going to use them both at once.",4,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"When I'm shopping for something on Amazon I typically like to purchase something with 4-stars or greater, and with 1000 reviews or more.  I purchased these for multi-function reasons, noise-canceling, music, and phone calls.  The earbuds worked great for noise-canceling but struggled from time-to-time staying connected while listening to music, which is not the worst, just a little annoying. However, the use of the earbuds during phone calls was horrific.  I had so many people tell me they couldn't hear.  It sounded like I was underwater or far away from my phone.  Since I spend a lot of time talking to clients and vendors I couldn't afford to keep them.  I had to return them!!UPDATED:",5,1,2019-7-20,1,1,0
"These earbuds are amazing! With one earbud alone the sound quality is crisp, and together, it only gets better. It fits perfectly in my ear, and doesn't fall out to easy. I use these while working on a propane forklift (very loud) and I can hear my music clearly, and they dont fall out. The button on the earbud clicks.  And hasn't gotten stuck or become unresponsive. The description advertises the ear buds last 2 hrs without charge, mine actually last over 5 hours without charge. Only things about these I did not like was that when only one bud is in the only function that can be controlled is the pause and play button, and volume control is not an option on the earbuds. Other than those two things, this is an excellent pair of ear buds",4,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
I ordered this for my husband for Father's Fay in 2019 and he found they did not fit well.  I thought that I would just keep them for myself.  I followed the instructions and found that after being left in the charging case (and they never did get wet) there was a substance between the charging contact and the ear bud.  It looks like what happens when a battery leaks.  I wanted to return them but it was 1 day past the return window. I posted my review and Tozo contacted me via email and explained that I must've received a defective unit. Tozo offered to send me a replacement set (newer model) or to refund me $40 via amazon gift card. I chose the $40 and am pleased with their customet service response now.,4,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"I've had 2 pairs of these headphones and both pairs broke within a couple months. The sound quality was great, they were very comfortable but only worked for a couple of months. The first pair started out great but after a couple of months the left earbud started to have static constantly. I contacted amazon and had them send me a replacement since I did sign up for the warranty.  The second pair, after another 2 months or so the right earbud just stops working, it won't connect to the left earbud or any device. I just contacted amazon they told me they won't replace them again even though they are defective. Apparently, there is a limit of one replacement even when the product is defective. When they work, the earbuds are great but I've had 2 pair now that just stopped working properly and can't get a replacement even though they are under warranty. I figured I just ended up with a couple of defective pairs and wanted to to have them replaced with a set that isn't going to break after a couple months since otherwise they were perfect but amazon won't help.",1,1,2019-9-12,1,1,0
"UPDATED review - The manufacture contacted me, had me try 3 different things to fix the problem. When these attempts did no correct the problem. They immediately replaced the earbuds without any problem. I provided the order number and they shipped them the next day. You cannot ask for better service than that!! Well done TOZO.Let me start by saying the Seller was great.",4,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
"- [ ] At first I really liked these.  Then, I noticed that every time I put them on,  my audio cut in and out.

Unfortunately this did not work.",4,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
"These earbuds were listed as Amazon‘s choice. They have been reviewed by over 10,000 people including myself now. I have used Apple AirPods for a couple of years now but I have started having issues. I didn’t want to spend buchu‘s of money  replacing my AirPods. I found these and thought to myself 50 bucks not bad I’ll give it a shot especially with Amazon’s return policy. Long story short I am pleasantly surprised with how well things sound the connectivity is easy no issue.  I would highly recommend these truly wireless earbuds for anyone needing to listen to music while working out or working in general. I have use them to make a phone call and they work well for that also. If I was being completely honest the only downside is you need to be in a place with not a whole lot of noise because they will pick it up. In other words when I use them at home I can talk on the phone fine, when I use them at work people have a hard time hearing me because of the background noise. Overall I am surprisingly satisfied for the price point and I plan on buying another pair for my wife.",5,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
"Best overall bang for your buck at this price range. If you think there’s one better, please hit me up, would love to know.1. Sound. Excellent for this price.

"I never write reviews. But tonight I had to. I am always skeptical of headphones or earbuds because they never sound good to me even the name brand ones. I love music. All kinds. So i need the bass, the high hat and all the other wonderful instruments. I need to hear them all where they belong.These headphones are great!!! They sound better than the over the ear ones I have and better than wired ear buds.",5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,1
"These earbuds are perfect for my purpose.  They charge quickly in their great little case on my wireless qi charger, stay in my ear, and turn my media on and off with a touch of a button.  In fairness, I must explain that I only wear the right earbud and use them only to listen to audiobooks.  I know they have capabilities far beyond my limited needs, but I can't tell you about how fabulous they are for listening to music or talking on the phone--not my gig.  But, I absolutely love that I can pause my books easily and listen while driving, gardening, walking, etc without wires or worrying about rain  and no one has to know that I'm ignoring them.  I wish when the power in the right earbud got low, that I could switch to the left earbud, but that doesn't seem to be an option.  Still great!",5,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0
"So after posting the review, the manufacturer has reached out to us and offered up a replacement due to our bad experience with the product.  It is their belief we may have gotten a defective set of ear buds and they are making arrangements to replace them with a newer model at no charge.  It is very nice of them to do this and it makes me feel better about giving them future business or recommending them to friends.  Knowing that they will stand behind their behind their product and offer solutions in cases like this is a trait that is hard to find these days.Thanks for the remedy TOZO.  Much appreciated.",5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"UPDATED REVIEW: These are REALLY good earbuds! Charger time says 4 hours, but for me they've lasted for as long as 6 hours! The sound is nice and clear and the bass sounds so good. Love the case and that you can charge them in the case on the go.There are only two small cons though, the first is that there's a robotic voice that says when your skipping or reversing and it is very jarring. Wish it just did so without saying anything. The second and the one that ruins it for me if that they're a little bulky, but it's enough to cause them to fall out of my ears. When wearing them the intended way, they're top heavy and fall out frequently. If I wear them upside down then that helps a bit, and for me makes a better angle for the touch controls, but they still eventually fall out. I'm 100% sure it's just my ear shape or size, and these would be perfect for someone with the right/regular ears, but it unfortunately docks a star in my book. There are different sized buds that I'll experiment with to see if that helps, and if it does then I'll update again and give the star back.",4,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"I understand that its sometimes not possible to make a single button perform many different commands, but out of all the options available, why is 2 clicks mapped to redial the last number? Who in their right mind would ever need that feature so easily accessable in a set of headphones? I can't tell you how many times I've accidentally called people while trying to play/pause a song. Its a terrible design choice. Switch it to skip a song or something useful. Other than that annoyance  these are good lil earbuds, and I've gotten my money's worth out of them. My right earbud has stopped making sound, but with as many hours and as much abuse as I've put them through, I'm not surprised. Still worth the price any day.",4,1,2020-8-21,1,1,0
"TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds are a Modern Marvel to me. I recently got a Sony Lossless FLAC/MP3 Walkman & thought I would try wireless earbuds for the Gym to use in addition to my Bose Quiet Comfort & Sennheiser wired headphones. I read a lot of reviews so a choice was difficult. I was skeptical of the reviews but took a chance because Amazon is so good at returns if justified. I am pleasantly impressed with the earbuds,  BT connectivity, charging case, fit and especially the sound. I never thought that an in-ear bud could sound so full. The Bass is there as well as mids and treble. So far I am very satisfied so far. If their durability matches their sound I would purchase from Tozo again.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"The best wireless earbuds ever. First I would like to say I am so glad they come with different size ear pieces. This really helps find the right fit for you. Second the case, the earbuds are placed in magnetically so they won’t fall out and can be charged via cable or wireless charging pad. I have mine plugged into my car cause it’s more convenient for me. Now for battery life. It’s pretty great! I use my earbuds for taking calls, listening to videos on Facebook, watching memes and movies so I can get a good couple hours of listening if I did it continuously nonstop. The battery doesn’t get used up when on standby so I’ll be at 25% battery before it’s time to charge again at the end of the day. The sound is crystal clear and when you have it in your ear it cancels out any noise to distract from your listening. I like that I have the option to use either one earbud or two so I will have my right earbud in all day and if I need to I can connect my left one in a snap. When it comes to connecting via Bluetooth it connects fast once connected it will beep like 5 times to finish connecting that’s only cause it’s waiting if you are trying to use the other ear bud as well or just the one but the beep will stop :)",5,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0
"It sucks that I have to write this, because these headphones are almost a great buy. So here is the deal, they have great sound, great range, actually VERY good range as I've walked 30ft from my device and still had connection. But here is the problem, everytime I want to use my headphones I have to listen to the most annoying beeping sound for a solid 10 minutes. EVERY TIME. Due to the nature of my work I  use one headphone, and so when I go to use the left bud it will start searching for the right one and thats what causes the beeping sound.  There is no way to disable this, some suggest that yo simply take out the other bud and put it in your pocket but when I try that my device will loose connection. Its possible that this is caused by malfunctioning devices so that will not effect my review.Here is the deal, I would LOVE to give this 5 stars, if they were to produce an app or put a button on the charger device that disables the buds from searching than I would for sure change the rating. It's so damn annoying having to listen to a beep every 10 seconds for 10 minutes when I want to use my device.",3,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
"Normally I don't do reviews like this because, well, I'm lazy. These were good enough, however, that I decided to take the time for them. First thing's first, nice packaging, simple instructions, several different size earpieces, and a carrying cord for the rechargeable case.The first thing I wanted to do was immediately test a song, who wouldn't. I'm a bit of an audiophile preferring open-back headphones in the several hundred dollar ranges so I immediately expected to be let down at this price. They were MUCH better than I expected. Do they sound like a million dollars? No. Should they? Also no. The bluetooth pairing makes it ridiculously simple and it's practically plug (or no plug in this case) and play. They sound perfectly fine for running, cutting the grass and droning out the lawnmower, early mornings avoiding conversations with coworkers. Very impressed.",5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0

Now won’t charge  says lifetime technical support but no way to contactI want to provide an update to my previous comment after my earbuds stopped working - the manufacturer reached out to me asap and we  have been working together to try and get my earbuds back up and running.  they have been really great in their support and  attentiveness and have provided several different troubleshooting measures i can try myself.  i changed my star rating to 5 stars simply for the customer service i have received....  regardless if we can get the earbuds working or not, they stand behind their product.",4,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"I am overall pleased with my Tozo earbuds. This is the 1st pair of wireless earbuds that I've purchased, and I did so on the strength of the top reviews that this product received. Well, I am definitely pleased with this purchase! The ease of pairing them with my Galaxy phone and other devices, such as my laptop and tablet, was very easy. I have not worn them in the shower, but the sound quality and battery life is exactly as described: Excellent! It was easy to answer phone calls while listening to music, and they even have a voice over informing you of the call number that's incoming, which is great is you're unable to look at your phone.As happy as I am with the earbuds, I cannot award it 5 stars because I do have 2 issues with them: 1) They do not have the feature to either adjust the volume nor skip or rewind my playlist; and 2) I sometimes get a random 1 or 2 second ""drop"" in volume to some of my songs. This is why I gave them 4 stars. However, when you consider that the Apple earbuds cost over $100 more, the price tag is even more significant. In short, this is indeed a top tier product that you can purchase at a bargain price!",4,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
"Very disappointed in the sound quality of these, it sounds very cheap. I compared it to the $40 headphones I normally use, which aren't advertised as being particularly good for bass, and these are noticeably worse.They are also very hard to put in. I have other earbuds with the same small earpad size that fit fine, but these never feel secure. They stick out, with a gap between my ear and the bigger part of the earbud. I definitely wouldn't be able to run or exercise in them without them falling out. They might work for people with larger ears. (Its also possible that the bad fit affects the sound quality)",5,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0
"CONS:  I would be giving these earbuds five stars if it wasn't for the fact that they frequently slip out of my ear when I am working out. The product says you can use them while swimming, yard work, etc, but I would not trust the earbuds doing something like that. Would never wear them out somewhere where it would be hard to find it if it fell out. I am even using the smallest buds it came with. The medium size won't fit me. For the price I spent on these, I honestly had higher expectations for the fit. And because of this lack of fit, the noise cancellation is pointless. Sound quality is good until it starts slipping out.The phone call feature is basically crap. Tried it out, the other person couldnt hear me at all.",3,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0
"Really great earbuds. The sound is crisp & clear.  I use these earbuds mostly for streaming videos at night before bed. They supply 3 sizes of covers for you to choose from.  The battery charger charges really quickly. I am most happy about the length of charge.  I watch movies a lot and I usually get around 6hrs of battery life per charge. Whats really cool about this system is you can use one earbud at a time. For example, I use one and when it dies I put it back in the charging case so it can charge and use the other one. Hence, keeping one of them charging so I really never go without them. Not to mention, the price isn’t bad on the wallet either.",5,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0
"Was looking for wireless buds for work. I work in a physicians office and needed something that provided good sound for my ears only. Also, I've always had issues with any type of buds not fitting my ears right.  After reading reviews, both good and bad, I bought these and am actually very satisfied with them. Sound quality is great, even on the lowest volume setting it's a decent level w/o everyone hearing it! No issues pairing device to my phone. They come in a neat case that is magnetically drawn to the buds so they won't move or pop out when carrying them in a purse/ bag.  And most importantly they come with different sized  buds-one of which fit PERFECTLY. I've used them on/ off for 3 days and still have a decent battery supply so far. Not a bad buy IMO.",5,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"So I own several pairs of ear buds and these are by far the very best I have had.  I love the sound quality and noise cancellation.  Have yet to hit the end of the battery life as I keep them in their case and they keep recharging.  Two things I especially like is their size and the fact that they are water proof.  They are so small most people don't know I am wearing them.  The fact that they are water proof is great too.  I don't have to worry about getting them wet when I work out.  Really a superior product.  One last thing is that my puppy ate one of my buds :-( and I contacted the customer service and they are sending me out a new one, no charge.  Great product, great company.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"I've always been a bit weary about wireless earbuds, but I took a leap of faith with these after losing my old pair.  My old pair was a set of Sony MDRXB50AP Extra Bass buds, which were really nice for the price.  The TOZOs are beyond better,  and well worth the extra $20.Sound quality is the best I've ever had in an earbud in this price range (I've never spent more than $50 on buds, but with these I don't feel the need to).  The bass is much more powerful than my old Sony's without drowning out the mids and highs (though if you disagree, equalizer settings on most phones can rectify this).",5,1,2019-3-26,1,1,0
"Having the ability to listen to music and phone calls through both years was fantastic! The sound quality was very goodHowever, due to the size, shape, and weight these earbuds were very uncomfortable to use for very long. You would have to shove them deep into your ear cannal, to a point of discomfort, in order for them to not fall out easily: also, I could not use these for any sort of exercise as they fell out very easily no matter which cushions I used.  Additionally, one of the units failed after a few days - it would no longer take a charge, therefore, I ended up returning them.",1,1,2019-12-15,1,1,0
"Have been using these buds for several days now and I'm very pleased.  They seem well made, sound quality is good, pairing is easy. Noise cancellation is as good as can be expected without active noise cancellation.  Mine came with 4 sizes of pads S,M,L,XL so they should fit anyone and provide decent noise cancellation.  This is my first set of true wireless buds and I was concerned about them falling out.  But with the correct size pads and proper placement in the ear this doesn't seem like it will be an issue.My previous headset is an LG Tone 780 and these are superior with regards to sound quality for both music and phone calls.  When making phone calls, the other party can hear me loud and clear, better than my LG headset.  Battery life is fine for how I use them.  I'm the type of person that keeps their devices on a charger anyway so I'll never test the full battery capacity of the buds themselves.  The wireless charging case is convenient and works well.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"For the price, I am truly impressed.  They were cheap enough that I figured it was worth taking a chance on my first earbuds.  I had planned to use them as a 'listen only'.  I mean, how good could they be?  Of course, someone called me when I was using them, so I took the call.  They didn't know (or suggest) that I was on a bluetooth device and everyone I have talked with has verified that they can hear me well.  Although you won't get 8 hours on one charge, they charge quickly in the storage box, which has its own self-contained rechargeable battery.  There may be better ones out there (presumably at a much higher price), but for me, this product is awesome.",5,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"This review is a work in progress.1st impression (6/14/2019):  It looks great.  Case seem more compact than initially thought which is good.  The earphones fit quite secure in my ears, which I was surprised with.  My ears are very small.  Tried head banging and spinning violently.  Pieces stayed secure in my ear.  I only had couple of minutes to observe sound quality.  Bass seemed good with good kick.  Highs seemed clear.  I will cover more on that later after longer use.  Haven't had it long enough to cover battery life or build quality although it seems to be built solid from initial look and fill.  BTW, my son has the new Airpod 2 which he purchased yesterday from the Apple store, which I got to try out, and I really didn't like the sound quality of it.  So far, I am very happy with the purchase of T10.",5,1,2019-6-14,1,0,0
"If you are in the market for a good pair of wireless earbuds under $50, these are great earbuds for a very low price.  They paired with each other and to my iPad easily and quickly. The sound quality is terrific once you figure out which tips fit your ears best.  Bass is low enough for my tastes.  Comfort and fit are nice.  The earbuds are very lightweight.  After a few minutes I forget that they are in.  The case works well and wireless charging is a plus.  The magnets in the case make putting the earbuds away easy and the case snaps shut nicely with the magnetic closure.  Battery life has been excellent so far.  I have not tested call quality yet but I don't really plan on using the microphones very often.  Bluetooth connection has been solid so far.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"I really like these earbuds.  I am swiching from corded earbuds to these wireless ones, so of course I am happy with the 'no cord' benefit.  The sound quality is excellent.  I did not expect the noise cancellation quality, as it was not an advertisment point, but I can't hear anything outside what I'm playing . . . given my household of kid, husband, chickens, dogs, etc. that is AWESOME!  The battery life I rated at 5 stars, but I at this point, am assuming they will perform as advertised.  If not, I will ammend my feedback.  I did have a small issue at first, but I contacted TOZO and received immediate (within 12 hours) help.  Everything is great now.",5,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
They fit perfectly in my ears and don't move. The sound quality is amazing. I pair them with my tv at night so my roommate can watch her tv and they stay in all night while I'm sleeping. It actually has a theater quality sound when using while streaming movies. I am so happy with my purchase so far. We'll see how they stand up over the test of time because I only had them a couple days but so far I'm extremely impressed with the overall quality. I love the color too!,5,1,2020-9-3,1,1,0
"AVOID THIS PRODUCT -- STOPS WORKING AFTER 2 WEEKSI was excited to gift these to my husband for his use at the gym (he goes about an hour a day), but he loved the idea...and they weren't cheap! (My own headset only cost $20-25!)",1,1,2020-2-20,1,1,1
"These are a decent pair of wireless earbuds. They have nice sound and are fairly comfortable in the ears, but I bought them for swimming laps, and they are not good for that. It says that they are good for distances up to 10 meters, but I didn't find that to be the case. My pool is 60 feet long and I put my phone at the midway point so I would always be within the 10 meters, but I found that the headphones only worked when I was no more than 10 ft away from my phone. Any greater distance than that, they didn't work. So they are really a decent pair of headphones, but you need to have your phone close by.",3,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
"I was skeptical at first having delt with some lemons in the past but as soon as I removed the buds from the dock they paired. Connected them to my iPhone with no hassle. Picked my favorite Volbeat song and bam! The difference was night and day to the ones I've been using for the past 3 years. The volume a tad lower than my older ones which concerns me a bit but won't know till Monday how they hold up at the factory where I work but so far I'm digging them. My old ones last 2 hrs at full volume so I'm hoping I get simular battery life as that's a deal breaker for me. I have two that I alternate between breaks but if this charging box holds true it will be a blessing as I only intend to use one bud per 2 hrs. Love the look, seem quality, sound good so fingers crossed they work out for my purpose.",5,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0
I was looking to replace a pair of bluetooth earbuds that were tethered together which I found to be awkward.  These are completely separate and more comfortable.  I use them mainly for Audible books and secondarily for music.  The sound quality is amazing for music.  Bass response is great for small earbuds.  They are really easy to pair with Bluetooth on my iPad and to each other.  In fact they pair to each other automatically all you need to do not is take them out of the charging case.  The charging case is very well built and charges the earbuds quickly.  The case can be charged with the included usb cable or wirelessly.  The case is small and easy to travel with.  It’s actually small enough to put it in your pocket.  The case has blue lights to show the charge level and the earbuds have a red light that shows it is charging when fully charged the lights go out.  The earbuds were easy to fit to my ears.  They  come with several sizes and recommended that you try all of them till you find the ones that works best for you.I highly recommend these for the reasons I have outlined here.  You can’t go wrong I promise you.,5,1,2019-9-26,1,0,0
"First off, this is like my 8th pair of wireless, I've returned them all for various reason. So I’m stoked.I just got these so can’t attest to a lot. That said, they were easy to setup, the sound is great for $35 and the manual says you can shower in them, which a lot of IPX8 cheap buds do not recommend. And I have a feeling they’ll fit under my motorcycle helmet, they’re very low profile. They don’t produce pressure points, either.",5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"My husband bought these for me to use around the house and in my studio.  I did not have the heart to tell him earbuds have never stayed in my ears.  After testing the smallest cushion I was shocked that they stayed in!  I am so excited.  I tried many other brands before and these are the first that stayed in!  I use them all the time and love them, so easy to just pop in and go.  The recharging capsule is so easy to use and pairing was quick and simple compared to other bluetooth devices I own.  I am so happy my husband found these for me.  He has his own pair in blue so we don't mix them up!We did discover that if we are both using at same time, we have to be careful to let each other know that we are pairing or power on as the earbuds are very intuitive.  I went to use my pair the first week and suddenly was listening to my husbands phone conversation instead of my audio book!!  Oops.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"I've been using for 3 months now and they still work, very pleased with that as you never know how long electronics will last. I like that I only have to use one of the earbuds and have my other ear open to hear surrounding noise.  Based on that I can't really comment on noise cancelling.  You can walk away from your phone quite a good distance and still hear which is very nice.I have very small ears and they fit without hurting.  I do wonder though -- what is the trick to stop  the interior mechanisn rattling when I'm running? I've tried the large buds, small ones -- which I thought fixed it but the sound just came back.  Note - this is not a criticism on this particular brand as I have this problem with any buds.",4,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
I have always had problems with earbuds without adjustable tips staying in my ear.  These fit great.  The sound is better than many other earbuds I have owned.  I have owned iPhones since they came out in 2007.  The battery life is fine for me because I don't usually wear earbuds for really long periods of time anyway.  The fast charge works great for me.  Volume control would have been nice but not a game changer for me - I am usually not that far away from my phone.  I like to listen to music LOUD anyway so I don't turn things down much.  These have great volume and bass. For the price I would definitely recommend them to anyone not looking to spend the several hundred for AirPods.,5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"These are a nice set for those with budget in mind. The sound quality is good for the price, although the bass they claim to have is very sloppy and takes away from the sound quality. The controls are terrible as they are click buttons rather than touch surfaces. You pretty much pop your ear drum if you try to press the bud button. The commands don't really make sense either (2 clicks makes your phone call back the last number you were in contact with). The comfort is pretty standard for an in-ear bud. Multiple spelling/grammar errors in the user manual makes you think you bought something fake.Overall, my discontinued $60 Samsung Gear wireless headset from 4 years ago is still better today.",3,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
These are really nice earbuds.I wear different pads (Comply) on my earbuds and the pads I had on my old earbuds didn't fit into the charging case (which is similar to this one) and it was a hassle to always take the pads off and replace them during the charging process. The pads totally fit inside this case and this saves me a step.,5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"Love these earbuds! I have searched far and wide for truly water resistant sport earbuds, and these seem to be the ones. I have gone through three previous sets of earbuds from other manufacturers, and in every case, one of the buds died, likely due to moisture intrusion despite their IPX7 ratings. I live in south Florida and get fairly sweaty when running outside. Earbuds with an IPX7 rating should be able to withstand such use, but apparently not. These earbuds have an IPX8 rating, and so far, the rating seems legit. My only gripe is their Bluetooth reception range is very limited. The right earbud is the master, and if I wear the transmitter on the left side of my body (wrist or upper arm), the earbuds cut out. Easily fixed by making sure the master earbud and source device are on the same side of my body.",5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0

"Addendum to my review below:  I am so sad that after a few days of use, I can’t seem to get these to hold a charge for any length of time!  The directions you get with this product are pretty worthless—definitely translated from Chinese—and  they don’t go out at the same time.  One goes out, then works for a while, then here goes the other one.  When they both work, the sound is truly amazing.  I’m SO disappointed! I thought I had finally found the answer to my need for increased volume, but they seem to always need to be on the charger.  I’m changing my rating from a 5 to a 1I have a hearing loss and wear hearing aids. Other Bluetooth collars I’ve had were difficult for me to hear music/Audible books because maximum volume wasn’t enough if there was any outside noise at all. I am so happy that I can hear with my new Tozos!!",1,1,2019-5-13,1,1,0
"The sound quality is excellent and the battery life is as I expected with these earbuds allowing me to listen for hours without wires. The noise cancellation is very good but doesn’t quite compete with the Bose set I have for comparison. Overall, these are 5 star ear buds especially given the fact you can run in the rain in them and sound  isn’t distorted in the least.I had an issue with the right master ear bud not working after about a month of having the set but customer service was quick to respond. They walked me through the reset process, which was also included in the packaging. Upon realizing that wasn’t the problem a new set was shipped to me. I would from this company who stands behind their product again.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
The customer service for TOZO is outstanding.  They read my previous review and reached out to me.  They offered me two options: 1) To refund my money back for the TOZO 10 or 2) Send me the newer version TOZO 6.  I decided that I wanted to stick with these type of ear buds.  I've just received the newer version just last week.  The TOZO 6 is slimmer than the TOZO 10 and fits in my ear with much ease and it feels more comfortable.  The case is also slimmer which is always a plus.  The sound seems to be very good and I am liking the new features as well.  It paired up pretty easily and I'm happy thus far.  I appreciate the customer service that TOZO has given me.  They were quick to respond and quick to come up with a solution.********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************,4,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0
These had great reviews so I got two pair. Both are total junk. The battery life is a joke. With the case I have to recharge it weekly. My old treblab800 lasted this long on the internal battery with no charging case.The leads that connect the the ear buds in the case that charge them are to short and allow the ear buds to turn on and connect to your phone at random. I had to sand the area on the ear bud where the leads connect to allow them to make solid contact. The plastic in this area is to thick. Another design flaw!,1,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
"I've had these for a month.  My least favorite thing is the voice that tells you when the buds are paired together and to the Bluetooth device.  Furthermore, the case is pretty big compared to other cases for Bluetooth ear buds, so it has a big profile in your pocket.  Also the ear buds are pretty big and stick out from your ear more than other brands.  And they sometimes still fall out of my ear, but only when I am gaming and never when I am walking (you can tell when they are about to and push them in more) The sound is very loud and I usually have my volume on the lowest or second to lowest setting (I wish the music went quieter)",3,1,2020-1-1,1,1,0
"At first look these headphones are easy to use and setup on your phone. After testing them for a couple of weeks I was noticing that the batteries of the headphones only last about an hour then need to be recharged. The other issue I was noticing is that every now and again the audio from the headphones would drop, then a few seconds later would resume as if the headphones lost their connection to the phone and re-paired themselves.Overall I would not recommend this as the lifespan of the headphone battery is the weakest component of this product. If you purchase this, make sure to bring a pair of corded headphones or another pair of bluetooth headphones.",1,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"I just bought my second pair (first set was great just wanted a white set to match my underwear) of these ear plugs.  I love these things and the rechargeable case is sweet to.  Only thing is when wearing the new ones I have the ability to read others minds.  Not complaining but It can become uncomfortable at times.  Other than that and the ability to fly these work just as they should.  Im a buyer for life hopefully these things break soon so i can order some new ones, but after seeing how well these things are made they will surely last forever.  Do yourself a favor and order yourself a set you wont be disappointed.",5,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
"The sound quality is decent but I am really rethinking the whole wireless earbud concept: These don't stay in my ears very well. Ive tried all of the inserts. None of them make them fit any better than the next because the buds are rather bulky in your ear and don't conform to the shape of your inner-ear. Active motion makes them come loose pretty quickly-even if I really jam them in there. They've already fallen out of my ears countless times, usually onto the ground but sometimes into something else not so nice, like a pile of Borax poweder, etc. I expect there will be a time, sometime soon, where one falls out into a storm drain or a toilet or somewhere else unrecoverable. The charging case is pretty cool though. Can't speak to the validity of the ""water resistance"" either.",4,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
"I was able to use the earbuds within minutes of opening my package. Be sure to try the different earpieces, it makes a huge difference. The earbuds are secure & all parts seems sturdy/well made.I will update my review if I run into any problems",4,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"This is my first set of wireless iems, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I feared poor sound, poor fit, cheap quality, constant dropped connections etc. Turns out they are virtually the opposite.I had them paired up to my V30+ in no time, adjusted the EQ to my taste via Viper4Android, and began to use them. These really sound fantastic, as it turns out, nice balanced tone, bass is solid and non bloated (these are not ""basshead"" buds, which I am very happy about) Mids and treble are clean, non sibilant, and the soundstage it pretty darn good. I love the case/charger, very handy to use. I will use these mostly at night before falling asleep, but the convenience of lying in bed without wires running to the phone is really nice. Build quality is also nice, again these belie their modest price. So...I'm very happy with these & glad that I purchased them.",5,1,2019-4-17,1,0,0
"I wanted a pair of wireless earbuds. These are ok, they aren’t anything special. I thought the sound quality would be better but it is subpar to me. There isn’t any bass with the music. I don’t know if there is a setting or something to increase the bass but it just sounds so flat. I didn’t realize how bad it was until I put in my wired headphones I got with my iPhone. The bass on those things was really good, which made me realize what I was missing out on. The price of these is great, not too expensive, but they definitely aren’t a product I will get again. As far as with phone calls, they work great.",2,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"So this is my 3rd pair of Tozo headphones that I have purchased. The first for my nephew, the second for my roommate, and this pair for me. It has been a roller coaster of emotions.Let's start with the positives: First off let me say how amazing these headphones sound. The bass is thick, the mids don't get lost easily, and the fit is fantastic. The sound cancelling is top notch and I have to actually take the buds out to have a normal conversation. The battery life is pretty solid, and the charging case is compact, well built, and fits nicely just about anywhere. Wireless charging is solid and the extra tips will guarantee a nice fit.",1,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"Sounded for the most part ok, a bit more bass than I prefer but I adjusted that on my own and it sounds close enough to what I find ideal. Battery life isn't totally awful, but it's definitely not long. I've only used my pair for two days so it's not like it's depleting, out of the box you will probably get a few hours which is again not bad but I've seen better in similarly priced/slightly more expensive earbuds.However, for the price, Im honestly nitpicking. It sounds pretty good, they're super convenient and they don't look half bad. Not to mention they stay in your ears pretty well. The charging case is super satisfying to open and close with the magnets, makes them feel higher quality. If you're just looking for a pair of wireless earbuds and aren't too picky and just need the bare essentials with decent sound, these will do the job without breaking your wallet.",4,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"Wow, I didn't know what I was missing until I received the Tozo T10 earbuds. The sound quality is really good...I can hear all the highs and lows very clearly now. It's been a while since I was using cheaper headphones before. They also come with a nice charging case with a semi transparent lid so you can see the lights on the inside without opening the case too, and a cord so you can wear the case around your neck I guess or hang it up somewhere, which I really like too. The controls on the ear buds are easy to use too. I just needed to use a magnifying glass to actually read the instructions, but I'm old, so that's okay.  And the price is right too. I think these earbuds are a great purchase and would definitely recommend them.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
"Look good, charge fast, will fall out when sweating due to none of the buds fit right and doesn't go in ear snugly unless pushed into ear canal and thats uncomfortable just like pushing on them to pause or silent or make a voice command, to do so you must push on the only existing button (off/on, pause/make a voice command) pretty firmly to activate and that pushes into ear canal causing pain and as I said ""only existing  button"" due to the fact that there is no volume up/down, no skip fwd/bkw etc. Only off/on pause. Hands free conversation is useless due to the fact it cuts out or can't hear you at all, speak to text picks up ok but don't dare put phone in a back or cargo pocket or walk 5 feet away because it will have connection issues.The coolest thing this can do is charge in a case and tru wireless oh they do hook up easy and fast other than that, I want to return them but then I'd have no music to work with.

"I purchased a set of Tozo t10 earbuds.  The price was good and there were an overwhelming number of highly favorable reviews.  Then I had the chance to try the product myself and not accept the reviews of others.  I am VERY pleased with the sounds quality WHEN I am playing music.  However, the weakness of the earbuds is revealed when making or receiving telephone calls.  Perhaps it's the microphone but sound quality WHEN making or receiving telephone calls is unsatisfactory for a bluetooth device.  So if you only want to listen to music, the sound quality cannot be beat. If you also need the earbuds for making or receiving telephone calls, I advise you to look elsewhere.",2,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"Works great and sounds amazing! Bought about 6, one for myself then the rest were xmas gifts. At 30$ each it was hard to pass up. Earbuds like these just show how disgustingly overpriced AirPods are.They connected to my phone quickly and sound great listing to music while at work in 1-2 hour increments. I haven't had the opportunity to listen to them longer but they already out perform my Jaybird X3's battery life by a long shot. I love the wireless charging capabilities with several wireless chargers on my desk it's just never an issue. It's odd that the right channel is primary as I would like to keep the left in ear and remove the right allowing me to hear coworkers, so I just leave the right out of the charger to keep it on. Not a real issue.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"I originally ordered the T10 model, but upon using them for a few months, the earbuds started to randomly turn on inside the case and constantly drain the battery. Before this issue occurred, I had no other problems with the T10, they worked great. I reached out to Tozo's support email and asked if there was anything I could do to remedy the situation. After confirming my order, they surprised me with sending me a newer model of their earbuds, the T6, which I received in just a few days.

The bass response is also incredible which I was not expecting for this price. I can literally tune out the world watching my favorite show or movie. And the sound is amazing!

"Little bulky, but other than that, these were great ear pods. High quality, good sound, good battery. Just a great product all around.*I lost one and stopped using the other... eventually I threw it away or lost the case and the other one. If you lose one, I think they sell one ear bud at a time so just buy a new one and don't give up on them. I bought these a very long time ago and just last week I finally found another set that I like. So buy these if you don't mind a tiny bit of bulk because they're good and high-quality and it'll save you a lot of time. Messing around with other unknown brands is a big waste of time and money.

"So far so good, took them for literal test run around the neighborhood while jogging at light pace, moderate sweat, noise cancellation and sound quality were excellent! Sweat didn't seem to affect them, waterproofing appears intact. Only problem is even after adjusting for different ear bud since, the unit as a whole is a little too thick for my ears and sticks out, doesn't stay lodged against the auricle of my ear as the wearing guide advises. While running at night I was worried abt them falling out and losing them while moving vigorously, so I sport taped them to my ears. They stayed in fine walking around the house though! I will try running with them in daylight or at the gym to see how well they stay in, when I have less chance of losing them if they do fall out.",4,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0
"Overall, not a bad product for the money.  However, these do not live up the claims the company makes about battery life or number of times you can charge the buds from a fully charged base.  I find with normal use I can get around 2 hours run time (claim is up to 4).  I'm lucky to get 2 full charges using a fully charged base, (again, the claim is 4).  These aren't necessarily deal breakers, just wish companies would be more honest.  Sound quality is just okay, nothing spectacular, but about what I expected.  The one thing I do have to give them credit is the fit, I've tried on buds that cost 5 times what I paid for these and either couldn't stand them or couldn't get them to stay in place.",3,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0

"Initially after I bought these, I was very impressed with the sound quality for the cost. The ear cups that came on them originally were perfect for my ears, I was able to exercise, run, workout etc. with them and never once did they fall off, even during my jump rope sessions! After a couple weeks though, I  noticed they did not feel snug any longer. I struggled to keep them in my ear and unfortunately one of them fell out as I was fishing and it sank to the bottom of the ocean :( I did have a couple good weeks out of them, just wish the ear cups didn't soften up so quickly causing the fitment to suffer.",2,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
I bought the ear buds because so often I will get the wire caught up during a workout. The range on the ear buds is great and the sound quality is really good. I had to play around with the different sizes for the ear pieces. The first ones that were the most comfortable would fall out during fast direction changes. I switched sizes and can do anything without the ear buds falling out. The customer service is outstanding and they are very responsive. If you are looking to get a more reliable set of earbuds.

For one reason or another each of them hasn't worked for me. These are really high quality, fit perfectly in my ear- even if I jump around, have really good sound quality and are light weight. The problem? A three hour battery life. UGH! I need something that will last 6-8 hours as I listen to a rain program while I sleep at night to drown our a snoring partner. I'm so frustrated that I can't find something like that without spending $200!! Crazy! I guess most people must buy these for working out, but some of us have other needs.

Battery life is really short... less than 3 hours. Earbuds are all too big and cause ear canal to start hurting before the short-lived batteries quit. The different sizes of earbuds range from too big to even bigger. They tend to fall out unexpectedly presumably because of the oversized earbuds. Other than these shortcomings the sound is good and so far no problems with showering with them in except for the occasional unexpected pop outs. I’ll update this review in few months to see if they hold up over time.UPDATE:  Heard from Tozo and they say that they are sending replacement earbuds as well as replacing the units with an updated model which would be great except that it appears they sent them to someone in California.  I told them about the errant addressing problem.  Will update further if the replacements actually get to me.,3,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0

For the quality you are getting with the Tozo earbuds you are getting the most bang for your buck. Im definitely purchasing more to gift to family and friends.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,0,1
"So, I was really hoping these were going to kick butt. The sounds quality is good, probably better than i expected, and I am not sure if there is active noise cancelling, or just the fit isolates sounds out, but that was also a nice surprise.There are a couple of things I cannot get over, so I may have to return.",4,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"For the most part they work but the charging case seems to stay on at all times and will also randomly power on the earbuds. The logic between the charging case and the buds is flat out broken. Even though the case should be capable of charging the earbuds multiple times, it basically continues to try charging until the case itself is drained. They get through a few workouts without problems so, again, they technically work. With a bunch of other options I can't suggest dealing with the small headaches you wouldn't have with other brands. I regret not returning these in time.",2,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"OMG. Seriously this are so much better in sound quality than anything I've had. These are amazing! Have the perfect bass, the clarity of the voice and music! I am shocked at the amazing quality. Also, these are so easy to charge, pair and use. Love the feature of being able to use just one. I was very scared as some reviews were not as good. Also, wireless tend to have less quality, but these are up there with Boss, Beats and big names. I bought these with my money. I had 1 gift card and it had a coupon, otherwise this is not sponsored whatsoever. Thank you and I hope this review helps.",5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
"These have great sound quality, when it's not shorting out. It does this quite often and I've only used them two times.Another thing that was incredibly disappointing is that you can't control your music at all. You can pause/play but that's all. All other control is for phone control which I don't care about. I didn't realize this until I went to use them because I've never had a pair of earbuds that didn't give the option to go to the next or previous song. Kind of strange.",2,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0

"The description clearly says that they are waterproof. This is a falsehood. I had them in while taking a bath and of course, the right one fell from my ear while I was watching netflix on my phone. Yes, it plummeted to the bottom of the tub (A horrifying depth of about 18 inches) And by the time I got it dried off and reinserted into my ear? It was dead. I've tried everything to get it to work, but no. They are officially toast. Sucks really, because I loved those buds. I had them all of a month before this happened. Will not be purchasing another pair from this company.",5,1,2019-8-10,1,1,0
"very disappointed, this is my second day using this earbud and the left one is already acting weird. It just has a problem with disconnecting constantly. Even the earbud is fully charged the left one disconnect in the middle of the music. The other thing I notice is you can not use just the left earbud and put the right one on the case. it does not work. Only the right earbud will work if you just want to use one ear.Updates: 03/31/2020",5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0

"I've been using these for a month now, and they are perfect! They were exactly what i was looking for, now i can listen to podcasts at work without disturbing anyone else! They work either one at a time, or both at the same time if you prefer.These earbuds have fantastic battery life, i listen to them 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and i only have to charge the unit twice.

"My son-in-law just bought a set of Google earbuds for $160 and was boasting about all they could do. I looked for them on Amazon, but they were not offered there--and boy am I glad! I found these instead with longer battery life, same features, more box charging ability AND AT $33 after the coupon box. Incredible quality of buds and case. I was not expecting that for the price I paid. I will update if I have problems, but they are easy to use, sound great, and in beige, they are not obvious in my ears. Very happy so far. I am able to forward to next or previous video on Youtube, mute, and use the digital assistant remotely.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"The price for these headphones is incredible. I have used them everyday since September 2019 while running in all types of weather. These headphones stay in wonderfully and rarely require re-insertion. They connect very easily and cancel almost all outside noise. My only issue is that sometimes the connection to bluetooth is dodgy and leads to interruptions in music, after a minute it tends to resolve but can be annoying if you are trying to get into a rhythm while running. Battery life is incredible and in my time of owning these I have only ran out of battery once while I used them all day. I would absolutely buy these again if I were to loose one or if they eventually bust.",4,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0

"I've had these headphones for about a month and a half now and I'm very happy with them. After buying pair after pair of super cheap bluetooth headphones that would suddenly stop working or the battery life would drop off after just a few charges, I decided to spend a little bit more and I'm so glad I did.I literally use these every single day- at work, at the gym, running outside, and just doing everyday stuff. I work in a lab where there's loud equipment and machinery operating pretty much all the time, but these headphones do a great job of blocking out ambient noise, while not blocking so well that I couldn't hear alarms or someone trying to get my attention.",5,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0
"I bought these for swimming, fully realizing I wouldn't be able to submerge my head. Someone else in the q & a section suggested getting a headband to secure them, so I got a swimming headband. Unfortunately, I tried all the different ear buds to find the best fit and they still fall out of my ears so easily. I tried to put the headband on to secure them, but then I couldn't hear the music.. I doubt they sought the feedback of a swimmer when they created these.  They're kind of pointless for me.. i really cant wear them swimming because they won't stay in. I cant wear them biking because they won't stay in...  they should have a string or something to help secure them or an ear loop. These don't make sense for swimming. Don't buy them for that.",2,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"This was the best purchase I've made in a long time. I have really been struggling with buying wireless earbuds because they are so darn expensive, and I was afraid affordable versions would not provide me good sound quality and ease-of-use. I was completely wrong. I took a chance on these and I am so delighted I did.  When I took them out of the packaging they quickly paired to my phone and I immediately began to use them. I am so pleased with the sound quality and how responsive the touch features are for control. I have made phone calls with them and people have said I sound clearer than I do when I'm using the Bluetooth in my vehicle. Really an exceptional product. Very pleased.",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"Haven’t had the earbuds very long so can’t really comment yet on battery life or durability. They seem very well constructed, have lots of inserts for correct fitting, sound amazing for the price and voice quality is good too. Given all the expensive earbuds options out there I don’t think you go wrong at this price with all the features included. Really appreciate the charging case as well. In all I recommend giving these a try if your in the market for budget earbuds. If you’re looking for top of the line, get out your wallet for the more expensive options out there.",5,1,2020-10-4,1,0,0
"When I first saw the product, I thought they were bigger than expected. I already suspected that they may tend to fall out. The boxy out of ear part looked heavy and bulky. I have small ear holes and need a snug fit. The sizers did not assist to hold them snug. They did fall out when bending over.  The worst part was when I touch any part of the earpiece, the play paused or would go back. The controls are so sensitive.  I use while working and sometimes at rest. There is no way to lay on the earbud without changing controls. Not sure how a jogger would do with this device. It would definitely not stay put for me.I returned them. Hope this helps you to decide. I have better bluetooth earbuds, but wanted a back-up.",3,1,2020-8-20,1,1,0
"First, let me say this a real review. I don't write these very often, so rest assured when I do one, its because I really really like a product.I first tried a brand of buds called,""Thor,"" and they were basically garbage.

So, i sent those back and thank God I did because I started reading reviews more carefully and payed close attention to HOW MANY their were which is really really important.",5,1,2019-10-19,1,0,0
"Dang, who in the world would drop extra money for those Apple EarPods when you can get high quality sounds for half the price with these bad boys?! I’m insanely impressed with not only the sound, but the fact that they actually stay in my ears! I was hesitant because of the shape. I usually have trouble with the round ones because I’m so use to the Apple head phones (the ones that come with the iPhone), and any other ear bud just falls out. These do not! They are absolutely phenomenal and I can’t wait to use them on my walks without a pesky cord in the way. Omg why are you still reading this review?! Add them to your cart and checkout already!",5,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
I’m very satisfied with him so far I’ve been using them for about a month now. The magnetic charging of the devices and the case that they come in is really nice. The sound quality is great. The only thing I wish is that they had some sort of better keeping system to them so that they would fit inside my ear better I know they do come with extra size had to try and fit many different ear sizes but seems like the weight of the device Works itself loose in a matter what size I tried. So I wouldn’t really recommend them as an act of our work out type earbud but for sitting or walking around there not bad at all especially for the money sound and connectivity is great and battery life is pretty good I get about hour and 3/4 probably to a charge and they charge up relatively quickly and up to about three times from the case being fully charged.,5,1,2019-4-14,1,0,0
"Not sure what the big whoop is about these; I've owned much cheaper earbuds that work better (thank you Big Lots).  I'm writing this review after wearing them for one month.  I cannot walk from my room to the kitchen (10 steps) without losing connection.  The battery does not last over 3 hours, even if buds are fully charged.  I'm actually okay with 3 hours, can be a pain for work (working from home no bueno!), but they claim it lasts up to 4 hours.  I feel like the worst issue is when exercising or slightly moving around the sound has a tendency to skip like a scratched record, not all the time but enough for me to find annoying.  It's even worse when you put your phone in an arm band to exercise.  Maybe this is a common issue with all wireless earbuds and I'm just unaware.  If that is the case maybe these issues won't bother you.",3,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"I purchased these to use in harsh environments, potentially with water and steam.  The work well and come with a good assortment of tips for proper fit.  Once you get the hang of inserting them (and giving them a little twist) they sit nicely in your ears.  The sound quality is fine and the pairing process was easy, but if I were to give one tip is to read the color card that comes with the kit before you do anything, it makes the process easier and seamless.  The charging case it came it seems solid and has a nice magnetic cover that snaps securely into place and is translucent so you can see the charging indicators through the top.  Overall a quality product, sounds good and works well.",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"The sound is awesome and it is very comfortable.I gave it a 3 stars because I used sanitizing wipe on this one time and the paint started to peel off. Thus, it is not well made and I don't recommend using alcohol on this product. Even the case is doing the same thing.  For the price, this issue is fine. If I paid more than 50 I wouldn't be happy. I've been using the Samsung buds plus. To be honest, this product comes close to it when it comes to sound and comfort.  This company has the ability to make products as good as Samsung and apples in the future.",3,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"The earbuds have a nice design along with its perks for being resistant(if not proofed) against water damage. The little battery container is a nice small design to carry in your pocket, and if you wished to hang it on a string for a more convenient carry, it provides a little loop on the side to feed string through.The earbuds themselves have a small design. Which can make me a little more conscience about losing them. But they fit in the ear very well and they provide for more silicon sizes in case the already rubbery interior of the earbud didn't quite fit. They stay in my ear surprisingly well for every day to day activities, however, when it comes to working up a hard sweat either working in the summer heat or just working out in general, I find that the earbuds start giving way to fall out. Now I do recognize that Tozo has other earbud products with an ear wrap around to keep earbuds in securely, but this product was advertised for ""Sports"" in the title. I would say these earbuds may not be the right fit for sports, but as I said before, Tozo does offer other earbuds better fit for Sports activities.",4,1,2019-9-12,1,0,0
"I am so pleased with this set of wireless earbuds that I bought a second pair for my husband. The sound is better than any of the other similar items in this price range, and we love a good bass track, so not just any typical audio device will do for music. The waterproof capability opens up possibilities for listening to music in the shower, and the charging case works quickly. I like the variety of sizing options as I have very small ear canals. I had a slight issue with pairing, but I followed the reset instructions and repeated the pairing process successfully. Overall, I'm very pleased.",5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"You could be a noob and pay $200 for Air Pods. Or you could just pay $50 for these Tozo T10s and get superior battery life, sound quality and isolation for a quarter of the price.The functionality and fit of these earbuds was very surprising to me for the money. I run and bike every day extensively every day, and have tried numerous earbuds and headphones to try to find something reliable and affordable. These definitely fit the bill. The earbuds pair very quickly to any Bluetooth device, and the charging case is a nice touch at this price point.",5,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"I received these headphones a few days ago and I am very impressed with the quality and build. The headphones have excellent sound-canceling quality even when sitting in a noisy coffee shop. The charge lasts several hours and it is easy to place back in the case for a quick recharge. So far, I highly recommend these for price and quality.Update: I have owned these headphones for about 10 months. Everything is great about them BUT one thing. When I put them back in the charging case, the headphones automatically turn back on. This, unfortunately, drains the battery over the course of a few hours. So that means I am constantly recharging the case and therefore these headphones are not reliable. If I manage to put them back in and they don't turn on, the case still somehow has no battery by the next day even if I did not use the headphones. Not sure if I got a bad product or not, but this has happened the entire time I owned the headphones. Currently trying to contact TOZO to work this problem out.

"I purchased these because i really wanted airpods but didnt want to spend AirPod money. The good thing about these headphones is that they dont really fall out. The charging case is great and lasted me my 17 hours flight back home. And the ear piece was great for your ears popping on the plane. The bad is that they don’t really have the best sound quality. And i think this is mostly because of the second reason they didnt work for me, which was they’re to big. I really had to shove them into my ear to make it work. And of course they slid out. I ultimately had to return them and still get air pods. But i think they might work best for someone with bigger ears.

I love the case: small enough to carry in a purse, protects the earbuds very well, see-through lid so you can check the power, and it allows for wireless charging, too. The earbuds are solid and sturdy, and the included plugs for different sizes of ears are awesome. The sound is excellent; I'm no expert, but they sounded marvelous to me. I use wired earbuds for hours every day, and the sound quality of the TOZOs was so much better. Unfortunately, I could not get the earbuds to fit my ears, even with the different plug sizes, and had to return them; I'm so disappointed.",4,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"Overall, these are decent performing earbuds for the price. Good quality feel in hand, both the ear pieces and the storage/charge case. The magnet that keeps it all closed and secure might actually be a little too strong, I’ve twice scared my husband from a dead sleep, while closing the case at night when it snaps shut. Hard plastic on hard plastic. Which is more of a drawback for him than for me I suppose. Bottom line, good secure case.I only have one real complaint about this product, the super cheery, Uber bright LED indicator lights on the earpieces...you can see them easily in broad daylight. You can see them even better at night, when they are flashing like little blue radio tower lights. Wear them at night outdoors, you’ll be visible from a block away.  I’ve taken to wearing my sleep eye mask on the side of my head when I use them in the evenings to keep my sanity. I’m easily annoyed by flashing lights in dark rooms.

But I wanted earbuds that were loud, clear and not crazy expensive. These ear buds are the best I've ever listened too. They were already charged when they arrived. I took them out and they connected immediately to my iPhone 8. I put both in my ears and was blown away from the sound quality! All across the spectrum the highs are clear and the bass is awesome!

I am finally able to run without annoying wires! I've never been able to find a air of earbuds that fit so well in my ear. Even the older apple earbuds that were very popular would fall right out.

I have had these for 6 months now and they have begun to cut out while walking. Phone is at hip level and it does not matter what material the pants are made of they still cut out. The left ear bud cuts out  a lot more than the right and it is closer to the phone. I only use them for walking or mowing the lawn so this has been a disappointment. Cannot recommend this product. When they worked all the time the sound quality is good for the money and they are not heavy in your ear.Sine this review the company has contacted me and replaced these keeping true to the 1 year warranty.

I've been using these a few weeks now on and off and have only changed them once. They come with different size earbuds so you dont have to worry about comfort or noise cancellation being an issue. I'm also really fond of the style and color. The case does change the earbuds as well and has a set of lights to indicate the charge which is super convenient.

One thing I will say is watch the pricing.

The left earpiece says it is paired, when I start listening to music it constantly cuts off.  VERY annoying!  The wired earbuds are still the way to go in my opinion.

They fit my ears perfectly, and even came with different sized buds just in case. I mainly use them to go running around my college campus, and never once have they gotten loose or fallen out from me jumping and landing. The one thing I haven't tried is using them in the rain or in the shower, but I'm sure the water proofing would work as intended. The sound quality is great, but I think the only downside is the short listen time. My commute over the summer was 4 hours round trip, so I had to charge them during the day unfortunately. Again though, you can't ask for much more for such a low price. Great product!",5,1,2019-9-2,1,1,0

They do not pop out ( since I've put the correct size on.) They come with four different sizes.  Strongly recommend, especially if you have to work in a noisy environment.",4,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"The product is completely not answers the expectations. And here is why: Its pairing period is somewhat 10-15 seconds. And its every time you taking them from the charging box. So, if you have a phone call and you wish to take it with your charging Bluetooth earbuds - there is no chance. Second, you cannot charge master earbud (right one), while using left one. Once you put the right one to charge both are disconnecting from phone. Next, play time of 3.5 hours is the same as idle time (out of charging box). So even if earbuds are not in use, but also not charging - they discharged in 3.5 hours. Solution is to hold them in the charging box, but in this case you will need 10-15 sec to pair them again... Also faced some strange disconnection of left earbud if it being put away from the right one even for the 3 ft distance (placed right one in the pants pocket, while left was in my ear). Another issue is microphone. Seems that only one mic is working on the right earbud, but if it on - people on other side can barely hear you talking. Not sure if left mic is exist and if yes, it wasn't working for sure (tried to speak into it and it wasn't any better). So, forced to use left one to listen and right one to speak. Not really what i was expected. Forced to return the product.",1,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0
"I usually do not write reviews on amazon,  but for this I felt compared to write one. I started my search for Bluetooth headphones because I brought some ""home Bluetooth headphones"" and I had such a hard time pairing them. Long story, short, I never got to pair them. So, while searching on Amazon,  I came across these headphones and I must say I am impressed. They worth a pretty penny but every cent is worth it. The sound quality is crystal clear. It has long battery life and it is easy pair to any device. I satisfied with this purchase. I recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphones.",5,1,2019-3-6,1,1,0
"After working with a single ear bud for a year mostly for calls, but a little for music/podcasts, I decided I wanted to go with a dual bud set. Saw a great deal on these after Thanksgiving, decided to give them a try, since they are so highly rated. Great packaging, love the plastic carrying/charging case. But the real WOW was when I put them in - great fit with the pieces it came with, easy pairing, and then THE SOUND! Wow. Loving them - will update after I abuse them for a while at the gym or regular wear and tear - but right now, very impressed.UPDATE! (You are going to love this)",5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,1
"I’m blown away by this product. I was skeptical because of the low price point when compared to the “premium” brands like apple. Honestly...these are extraordinarily better than the air pods, which I also own. These feel much nicer, the case design is better (though a little more bulky) but I like the larger case, tends to be found easier! The LED charging indicator lights are nicely placed, and the top of the lid is a smokey see-through that allows you to see the charge level. Also, wireless charging compatibility is awesome.Now, sound quality. They’re just as good as the air pods. The noice cancellation is great, not the best, but gets the job done without having to max out the volume.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0

"Love this product - easy to pair, and use right away. I don't really like to plug both my ears, so the Left and Right buds can be interchangeable to either side of ear which is great (I use one and other is charged in the case). The small case had the lid slightly transparent so you can see charging indicators. From design, it is slightly bigger in size, but can snug fit easily by rotating. Definitely more elegant  design than many other choices of this price range. Haven't really assessed the impact of noise-cancelling at this time, as most of my calls were indoors so far or within car and it looks like callers can hear me fine. Will update this review as time progresses..for now, it works well for my needs.",4,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"The GOOD - I am an avid mountain biker and runner, I am very impressed on how they stay in the ear, even after a couple of MTB crashes.  They do slip a bit in the ear, but a quick re-adjustment takes care of that - be sure to experiment with the different size buds.  Sound is better than expected.The BAD - Not sure what Tozo advertises, but the charge only lasts 2.5~2.75 hours at 3/4 volume.  My phone is carried in my pocket so no drain on Bluetooth distance.",3,1,2019-7-17,1,2,0
"They stay in my ears (which has been a constant irritant with other headphones), good range of bud sizes to choose from. Very comfortable.  Paired immediately - may be the easiest pairing I've ever had with a product. They sound fantastic!  I enjoy EDM and the highs and lows are all there!  No noticeable distortion. My only problem is that when I wear them I can't hear anything except the music, lol. The charger/case, the ear buds themselves, everything feels much higher quality than the price I paid.  I really couldn't be happier about the sound quality!  I suspect my spouse will be order a set soon.",5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"When I received the headphones, they only worked when I stuck my phone in my bra. If I put my phone in my pocket the headphones would not pick up the sound very clearly, it kept cutting out. When the phone was next to the headphones the sound was very good and sound canceling was great. The battery life lasted for a long period of time because I only charged them once.I feel this could have been a bad set, however the company was very focused on customer retention and correcting the issue. They went above and beyond in customer service to correcting the problem and truly care about customer satisfaction.  Because of their customer service I give them 5 stars.",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"The TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 wireless earbuds is a replacement set. I was nervous ordering them due to previous earbuds. Clearly NOT from this company, those were 3 months old & nothing but issues. With that said I’m so happy with my choice!  The sound is amazing, they were easy to pair up and the Quality of the product nice strong sturdy and I’ll get back to you on the dependability but so far so good & the price well worth it. My house is an ALL Apple house & my options for AirBuds was another Apple product or try something new. Now this is important... this set of earbuds the sound alone compared to Apple earbuds that are priced at almost $200 are BETTER then Apple earbuds, better.... And they’re waterproof!! I opened my Package of TOZO T10 Earbuds yesterday & was enjoying the the music, sound, ease of pairing them and  the fit for my ears, WOW! For me the fit of any earbud is always a problem, this particular pair of earbuds what can I say but Thank you!  Yeah let me get back to my Oopsie, I’m outside weeding my flower beds & skimming the pool & bla bla bla so he needless to say a lot of movement going on & not once did I have to adjust the airbuds. It gets better I accidentally fall into my pool & Of course it’s the deep end, sneakers, glasses, cloths & TOZO T10 earbuds & the earbuds unboxed only an hour ago. OMG 😱  I popped up from deep-end in Total panic mode, glasses still on my face & brand new earbuds still securely in my ears, I’m  thinking my brand new earbuds are done for I only had them at this point for about an hour, now it’s clearly not registering in my brain yet the music was still playing when I came up out of the water blew my mind! What can I say love the earbuds couldn’t be happier! Now they have another brand would they still be working today? Listen, Try them what do you have to lose if you’re not happy with them you can return them but I will bet  you won’t,  you’ll love them as much as I do!",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"I just love these ear buds. This is the first time I have used earbuds and thanks to TokoT10, it is a great experience. They are so easy to pair which is great because I am not too mechanically inclined. The quality of sound is good and easily adjusted. The thing I like most about them is that they are so comfortable.  I love listening to audio and these ear buds can be worn for hours. The charge lasts about four hours and they are so easy to recharge. I recommend these to anyone who likes to make listening enjoyable. So glad I have them. They are indispensable.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"While the audio is clear and crisp it is crisp as in no low to mid frequencies. Vocals all sound tinny and there is no bass at all. The snare drum and high hat cymbal is loud and clear if that’s your interest. I had hoped to free up the worship team from their earphone monitor console and I will get their input.  I’m sure I'll get a thumbs up for wireless freedom from their console but totally thumbs down for overall audio quality.  For what it’s worth, so far, I have only tested these earbuds with my iPhone and iPad. If I find anything new worthy of mention I’ll update this review.Update: Bluetooth latency is unacceptably long. That may or may not be more a transmitter issue. From speaking into a microphone to hearing in the earbuds is a delay of maybe a second. For their intended usage of streaming audio the latency is not much of a issue but if real time audio is needed Bluetooth is not the answer.",2,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0
Got these in June and used them pretty steadily.  Even wore them in the shower a bunch of times and they worked like a charm.  Sometimes water got stuck and the sound would be muddled for a spell but when it dried up everything was fine... and THEN the right one just stopped working.  I thought it had merely died so I put it back in the case and it didn't power up... thought the case maybe wasn't powered up enough so i put the whole thing on a charger and it still didn't power up.  left one works fine but who wants just one working headphone....  SUPREMELY disappointed...,1,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"Update: I emailed the seller about the right earbud not working they were happy to send me a replacement one without the hassle of sending the old one back.

Some sellers don't even respond, but I am impressed at the customer service provided by this seller. I am hoping that the new replacement earbuds that I recieve will actually work for a long time.Update: I have used these about 4 or 5 times since I bought them and now they have stopped working.

"These work great and are easy to setup. No issues. I don’t love the fit in my ears and they tend to fall out. Part of that may be my ears but I’ve tried all of the different sized options and the weight of the buds still causes them to eventually fall.To be fair, most ear buds feel like this to me. Rarely are they snug on my ears but I was hoping these would stay in. They are fine for now because it’s winter and I have a hat over my ears when running that holds them in place but once it warms up, I won’t be able to use these.",3,1,2020-1-6,1,1,0
"I liked the sound and found them to be comfortable.  I never made it to battery life as they were not as described.  I was expecting a physical button but got touch tone instead.  That is way too difficult to deal with.  If I have to readjust so the don't fall out, I end up skipping or turning the volume up or down.  Not for me.  I need a button, like they claimed to have.",3,1,2020-8-29,1,1,0
"Got these as my first pair of bluetooth earbud. Figured I'd start off with a cheap pair to see if I even like them, then maybe consider getting Apple ones later. One feature I love about these is that each bud can be paired with your device independently. I often use only the right bud when I'm out walking so that I can hear traffic and stuff, and all sounds come out of that right bud instead of splitting between two and losing half of the audio as with traditional earbuds. They're not the most stylish honestly--they're kind of bulky--but they stay in my ear and get the job done!",5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0

"I wanted to love these but fit is the main issue for me, I know that everyone’s ears are different so it’s hard to create something that fits everyone but even with trying all the sizes it still feels like it will fall out. I have yet to workout with them in but considering when I use them for work and am just sitting and it doesn’t stay in then I’m sure while running they won’t work. They are bulky and stick further out of my ear than I would have hoped.The sound is a bit scratchy sounding in mine. Also, when phone is in my pocket it will cut out. With all the reviews I was hoping for a better product.",3,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
I absolutely love these wireless headphones and the price point is perfect. I had them for about 8 months and there was an issue. Working with the company was amazing and it was under 1 year warranty. They replaced it without any hassle.I use them in the shower every day without any issues. They charge very fast and typically last about 4-6 hours with continuous use. The base acts as a charging brick that you can charge and then bring with you. Then you just charge the buds over and over throughout the day. I love the sound quality. They block out all other noise.,5,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
"The sound is pretty decent, but the fit is not very good. They fell out often just by waking around the house making them useless unless i sat and listen to a podcast or music. Any physical activity they fell put within a minute.They are a lot larger then other buds I've seen which I wouldn't care but maybe the bulk and weight is what makes them fall out often. I'd say don't get them if you like the look of pixel 2 buds or even galaxy buds. People say you get what you pay for and that is it here in a nut shell. Paid a cheap price for an inferior product.",1,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0

"Customer Service for this company is wonderful. I had problems with the first set of earbuds I purchased and they replaced them. The new pair works great.The volume control and range is limited.

And the lowest volume setting is not very quiet.",4,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"UPDATE: Customer service from the company was very helpful and refunded me the amount for the earbuds without having to return them (which were outside the return period anyway). My hope is that my unit was an isolated incident. I'm glad they are willing to stand behind their product.The earbuds were decent while they lasted. The left earbud would intermittently cut in and out, and got significantly worse as time went on (against my thought that it was originally just a software glitch, this problem sounds more hardware-related).",4,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"I was looking for wireless headphones to replace my wired ones because I kept snagging them on things in the kitchen. These are perfect. They're small but they stay in my small ears and are comfortable to wear. They come with four different sized ear thingies, so there are lots of options. I didn't know they were noise cancelling, so that was a bit of a surprise, but they seem to work well for that. I doubt the sound is quite up to something you'd get on a $300 pair, but for everyday listening and podcasts/audio books, they're great! I have no complaints.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"UPDATE: So my first pair broke within a month because one of the left earbuds stopped charging for some reason. I contacted the seller and he immediately sent me a free one at no cost. These earbuds are better than apple airpods and out of 3 different earbuds I've tried out from amazon similar to this price, the SOUND QUALITY is amazing on this. Im an avid runner and I lift weights 3x a week. I love the accessibility and comfort of these while in motion. I would say the only CON to this would be the short battery life compared to others. But these are the best in the market. If mine breaks again, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another pair.",5,1,2020-6-18,1,1,0
"Another update: I reached out to the customer service nearly 11 months after my purchase. They sent me Factory Reset instructions.  The volume and sound quality was restored.

The replacement works well, with occasional dropoff of the left earbud. This is noticable when a car passes by during my walks.",4,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"I would give this a 2.5 but since it’s only 30 bucks I’ll round up. This is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones.

I find myself adjusting very half mile or so. One size fits well at the beginning of the run, but once I’m sweaty they become loose and in danger of falling out.",3,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
"Decided to try my hand at wireless ear buds for working out in the gym and for road cycling. Overall extremely satisfied with the quality of the sound and level if noise cancelling. Happy regular listening and no issues in gym. I had one successful bike ride out of 4 rides so far where audio didn't cut out while cycling... I'm not sure the issue here but would love a fix if possible because I have enjoyed the comfort, functionality and sound quality over the the past week of owning these. Updating my initial review. Customer support reached out to me and sent me a new pair of earbuds, of their own accord and no charge to me.  Turns out there was indeed a glitch in the first pair of earbuds. I've gone on 3 rides since receiving new earbuds and all 3 rides have proven that these ear buds are the real deal. The noise canceling and sound quality on the rides are epic! I got exactly what I was looking for and hope that the next model will have more features along the lines of changing tracks. Satisfied and impressed by customer service initiative. Still wasn’t getting the most out of these earbuds on my bike rides so customer service reached out again to send a newer model to replace the replacement model. This company is really trying its best to provide a quality product and satisfy its customers. I hope the newer model delivers. I rate it 4 stars now but when I get the newer model I’m assuming it will indeed deliver and I’m hopeful I can rate 5 stars at that point. Thanks TOZO for your honest and consistent efforts. Can’t wait for new earbuds.",4,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
I'm super picky about headphones and sound quality....I hardly ever right reviews...but these deserved one. Before jumping in. The packing was excellent. Very nicely boxed and wrapped. Not like a lot of other cheaply packaged products. This does NOT feel cheap. The box I got shoes bloack headphones....but mine were white...which was totally no big deal. The white charging box was sleek and make of a nice material. The buds fit on the magnetically and charge instantly. I love that I can charge the box wirelessly if I had a wireless charger. The one year warranty is definitely a bonus. For the low price ($49.99 with a $15 off coupon) I am highly impressed. The sound quality is great!! Gift reccomend this product!,5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"I was initially happy with this item.  The sound was good and the price was nice.  However, two days ago I was wearing them while changing my shirt and the right bud popped out and fell to the my wooden floor.  Keep in mind, my head was IN my shirt when it popped out, so it slid down the shirt and MAYBE free-fell 2 feet to the floor.  It immediately stopped working.  When it says ""Right side connected"" after taking it out of the case, it sounds like a robot that's low on batter or has had a stroke.  And when I tried to play music, no sound came out.  Since then it has stopped charging and is just dead.It's really dissappointing that the product is so fragile that a very short drop onto my bedroom floor would break it.  This isn't like dropping it onto concrete or accidentally stepping on it and seems well within the range of ""normal wear""",1,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"I purchased these earbuds back in January of this year, and have used them faithfully everyday!  They pair easily to my iPhone and iPad and stay connected for more hours than any other pair of Bluetooth earbuds I have owned.  One feature that I love about them, besides the sound quality is that you don’t have to turn them on or pair them once you have set them up.  You just take them out for their case and put the. In your ear and start using them.  I mainly use them to watch videos on YouTube, as I spend a lot of time in the hospital as I am a cancer patient.  Their customer service is outstanding, when I had a problem with them, and couldn’t figure it out on my own, I sent the company and email and they responded within 24 hours with a solution to my problem.  I highly recommend these earbuds.",5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
"So, I read all the reviews and everything seemed legitimate especially for having so many. The products in the reviews matched the product being advertised.

"I had another wireless bluetooth earpiece that died on me and I wanted to get another bc I absolutely hate cords and I needed an earpiece to use in bed at night so my man doesn't have to listen to my whatever I happen to be watching on my IPad.  I read other reviews on how to pair each earpiece separately (can't remember which reviewer but thank you!!!) and it works but to perfection.  I love that I can listen to one earpiece while the other one stays charged.  The only thing that would make it better is if the individual earpieces were smaller.  I mean maybe I just have a small hear but I feel like they stick out a bit when I have them in.  I only use them at night in bed so far so I guess it hardly matters if they stick out.  Overall, extremely satisfied with purchase and would recommend.",5,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0
"First and foremost be warned that the amazing reviews are thanks to a free offer for a wireless charging pad in exchange for a 5 star review. The main reason I purchased this brand was because of how many people raved about them. I was super annoyed when I found out the truth.The truth: they're not bad. They sound great and feel comfortable and the case feels very sturdy and safe. They last about three hours and charge in about 1 hour.

"These TOZO T10 Wireless earbuds are my first experience with wireless earbuds. The instructions are excellent and clear, but I did not (initially) read them closely enough. The first time I attempted to pair the buds the only TOZO product listed on my cell phone was T10L. I selected T10L and only the left earbud worked. I went back to the instructions and they clearly stated DON'T select T10L. Following the instructions (this time) I reset the buds. The second attempt to pair my cell phone offered the T10R selection. Selected T10R and both buds paired properly. They work well and stay in my ears.

I used them at the gym to help me escape the terrible music they blast over the PA.  I listen to podcast and music that is more meditative.  So I searched Google, Youtube reviews and personal recommendations for a new set of headphones.  Number one on my list was not to spend as much money.I bought the gambit of cheap headphones.

I have switched back and forth with the same results.Do I have a defective product or am I missing a setting?",4,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
"When I first started using these earbuds, I was not impressed with the sound quality. This was mostly my fault because of two specific things, 1) the rubber earbud inserts were 1 size too small for my ears and 2)I did not have the earphones as tightly fitted and as deep in my ear as they need to be for the sound quality. I have weird ears maybe, and I have to pull up on my upper ear and gently push them in.  With larger plastic ear inserts (4 sizes total included) and pushing them a little further into my ear the sound quality improved DRASTICALLY, I heard much more bass and mid tone, which previously was completely lost when I was not wearing them correctly.  Overall I give sound quality a 4/5, but hey, they are only $40.As far as general functionality, they turn on quickly upon removal from the case, they sync nearly instantly with my phone and to each other.  Play time is about 3 hours but I charge them quite frequently with the case so it hasn't been a big deal so far. The case seems to hold enough charge to recharge the earbuds several times.",4,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0

The only way I can keep the connection somewhat stable is to put my phone in my bra--which I was trying to avoid with yoga pants with pockets in the first place. And even then, if I turn my head too far to one side, the connection is lost.If you plan on putting your connected device in your pocket, don't buy these earbuds.

Sometimes ""affordable"" headphones can sound a bit tinny on the treble, but these are well rounded and an overall pleasant listening experience over several different genres with decent bass. Nice unboxing, premium feeling materials. I like the magnetic closure on the charging case, though it's a bit larger than I expected (which could make it easier to keep track of). I also like the look/style of the buds themselves. They don't really have noise cancellation, so I didn't rate them on that aspect.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0

I purchased both these and the ""SoundPEATS True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds in-Ear Stereo TWS Bluetooth Headphones Wireless Earphones"" as lightening deals on Amazon.  On one note, these were about 20% cheaper so that has some weight to it, however the fact that the ear buds do not charge while the case is charging is miserable.  Battery-wise these are no comparison.  After 4 workouts these ear buds & case are dead and need a recharge.  The SoundPEATS on the other hand lasted me 3 weeks (15 workouts) on a single-case-charge and unlike the TOZO Earbuds, the earbuds can charge while the case is charging.  On the plus side, the battery does last the length of a workout for me (about an hour) but the fact that they don't make it through a week of workouts is a sticking point.",3,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0
It was way too big for my ears and will not fit in yours. I gave themail to my husband and couldn't even fit in his ears... not recommended and the case I'd way bIngersoll than my palm the earbuds are not the sizero of a quarter but bigger and not water proof I returned them the day I got them they were so crazy a drop of rain got on them aND they didn't  work anymore do not buy waste of money and time!,2,1,2020-5-3,1,1,0
"They fit great, and don't come out during intense gym workouts. They sound great, much better than my last wired pair! They look great, very unobtrusive. The charging is super convenient and fast. They're fairly rugged too, as I'm never worried about breaking them. The connectivity is perfect. I haven't tried with phone not on me, but there are zero stutters or drops during typical listening conditions.The only features they left out - that you can get at 4 times the cost of these, are better controls. They turn on/off and answer/hang-up calls, that's it. Would've liked volume and music track (next/prev) control gestures or click sequences. But these are the entry buds you've been waiting for.",5,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
"This is my second pair of Tozo earbuds.  I had the T8 for a few years, and this is the T10.  These show why, imho, paying $150 to $200 for earbuds is just foolish.  Very good sound, not as good as the super expensive ones I'm sure, but very good.  I wear them while mowing and weed whacking and other s*** work outside.  Comes with many rubber ear pieces and the ones that fit me best seal out noise excellently.  Very comfortable.  They never move/fall out even when I'm riding over bumpy services or working hard outdoors.  Even the charging/storing case is smart, with magnets that pull the buds into place when you drop them in so no fumbling when time to recharge.  My only gripe is getting about three hours battery life, at relatively high volume, but that's nothing to me in return for buds that are 80% as good as ones costing 200-400% more $$.  Very happy with this purchase.",5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0

I do think it's very cool that as long as the holder/case for them holds battery power, the earbuds will always be charged. I have had them a few weeks, charged to full when I received the product, used them nightly for about an hour (almost every night) for zoom and have not had to recharge the case/holder. Noise cancellation is amazing. Finally happy with the quality of earbuds!",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0

"After allowing for a full charge, I did my test. The earbuds connected with each other, and then found my iPhone quickly with no issue.  However, when I used the earbuds, the left earbud throws out distorted static above the music.  It’s connection with the right ear bud fails to provide quality sound.  I also tried an audio book and same thing.  The voice speaking has a fuzzy static to it.  There is no way these are acceptable or usable.  I would love to find out I have a defective unit or a wireless channel setting I could adjust, but I didn’t see anything that detailed in the manual.",1,1,2019-9-12,1,2,0
"Nice sound for a reasonable price.Update,Ive used these earbuds a couple of times now and found that the batteries in the ear piece and the charging unit do not last as long as they say,nowhere near as long.The charging pack lasted for one charge of the ear piece and was totally drained.The ear piece lasted for approx. 2.5 hrs. each time I used them.The sound is decent but if you are looking for tunes that last a good while you will have to take a break from your project and recharge.Update 4mo. in and they are dead,the batteries gave out.Time to try another brand,hopefully I'll have better luck.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"Sound quality is pretty good so far.  The fit works for me as well, though it does take some adjustment to get it just right.  For the price point, I am extremely happy to date.  While it was not a recognized brand for me, which causes me hesitation in electronics and sound producing items, I am pleasantly surprised.  It will take awhile for me to get all the functions down on the earbuds in terms of what button presses do.I have yet to test call qualities at various areas, such as in crowded areas, to see what ambiant noise the mic picks up.",4,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"These headphones work well and are comfortable to use. The instructions are fairly unhelpful, but they're simple enough to figure out, or look up online. I mostly use them for biking or just to have music playing while someone else is nearby I don't want to disturb. They bounce out of my ears after about 15 minutes of activity, especially when I'm breathing hard. When I've used them for running I've mostly had a hat on, since it is winter, so that hasn't been a problem so far, but the sound disappears completely as they get pushed against my ears by the hat. I would be very cautious using them for swimming (like the instructions suggest) because it feels like they would fall out.",4,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0

I hoped this would be a cost saving solution to Apple AirPods or Powerbeats Pro.

"I tried really hard for these to fit. Spent almost an hour trying on the different caps and looking up online how best to put in ear headphones on. Got the left one to fit ok, but my right ear just was uncomfortable (probably a me thing, not the product). But even though I got the left one to insert and stay properly, the unit itself just stuck out of my ear so much that I know after hours of wear, it would feel uncomfortable because it doesn’t rest on my ear at all (it’s literally just holding on by sheer force of friction). So if you have small ears, probably not your best bet.",3,1,2020-8-3,1,0,1
"These head phones are great! The sound quality is superior to any of my other headphones. These are the absolute best for noise cancelling. They work alittle too well! I have to remove one earbud if I want to hear my surroundings (not complaining). They are comfortable enough that you can forget you have them on at times. I can hear my calls crystal clear and the other person can hear me clearly as well. The only thing that I will say can be improved upon , is the size of the earbuds. They are a little bulky and pertrude just a little to far out of my ears but other than that no complaints.",5,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"I got a pair of these earbuds for Christmas. The sound was great and they were pretty comfortable. The battery would last several hours. I would usually only use one at a time until something happened with the left one where the sound was really quiet and sounded awful. I would turn my phone volume all the way up and could still barely hear it. That was in about January or February. I've had the earbuds for four and a half months and I've only been able to use the right one for about three and a half months. Well, that happened to the right one today, too. These earbuds lasted me four and a half months. I've tried to find a way to fix this, but have so far come up unsuccessful. If you want a pair of earbuds you can use for hours a day, several days a week, I'd suggest getting a cheaper pair and replacing it as needed.",1,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"Got these as a holiday gift and it didn't take much to set them to my phone byway of Bluetooth.  I was listening to a podcast but music will be next.  I'm going to use them in the pool for water aerobics and I'm a little afraid that they'll fall out.  Without something to tie them together, I'm also afraid that I'll loose one.  The holding case is also the charging case and it speaks to you!  They're easily charged through the car charger or wall plug but it does use the older style plug vs the one for the Samsung S8 and up.  Important to know if everything you've got is using the newer plug.  Other than fear of loosing the things, they seem to work just great.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"1) The primary reason that I have this a low rating is that the left ear bud has malfunctioned about 6 months after purchasing.  I have not used them that much and they have not been exposed to perspiration or water.  The left bud simply stopped connecting and will not re-pair with the right.  I have tried everything in the troubleshooting guide, including making sure the connections are clean and that the bud is charging.  I have also attempted a reset (purple flash).2) The other issue that I have noticed with these buds is that they are very sensitive to signal strength.  For example, if I put my phone in my left pocket instead of my right (which is closer to the right/master bud), they sometimes have an issue with connection and sound fades out.  Also, turning your head quickly to look at something causes them to fade out.  Very strange.  I understand the human body will block some signal in this spectrum but I would not think that they would be that sensitive.",1,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0

I just received the product, from quality , user convenience and sound quality perspective so far I am happy to buy this TOZO10 earbuds. I am really looking forward to go for a run and test these babies noice cancelling quality and durability. My only concern is that my ear hole is really small and thank goodness they provided all sizes of earbuds so the smallest one fit my ear. Once I go for my evening run, I will be able to test if it stays longer in my ear and I am able to enjoy my songs/podcast. I will share update soon and update my ratings accordingly.

"I used to buy the corded Bluetooth earbuds (for lack of a better explanation), but I figured for the price, I'd try these wireless ones. Total game changer for me. I use one bud at a time at work, and when one bud gets low, I can just switch to the other. Portable charger is awesome, Bluetooth switching between earbuds is seamless, they charge fast, fit well and sound good. They don't sound better than my studio headphones, but If that's what you're looking for, you're barking up the wrong tree. Otherwise, these are a tremendous value. I'm very happy with them.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"Five stars all the way around! I am loving everything about these earbuds! One of the best features about these is NO CORDS!! I have really long, thick hair and my previous Anker Bluetooth earbuds were good but had the wire connecting them and it was constantly a nuisance getting in the way or tangled in my hair, so its SUPER nice to not have to fight my hair or shirt, etc... with these ear buds. They look nice, the case is great, they are very comfortable to wear and the sound quality is fantastic. I can really hear the bass! I like that I can use the ear buds separately as I wear them at work for background music and get a full day out of the batteries by swapping them. I have used them for a couple calls and the person on the other end had no issues hearing me or with background noise so that's a definite win! The noise cancellation is great, maybe too good, even if I pause my music when talking to someone I still sometimes have to take the bud out to be able to hear them properly but not a big deal, it's great to drown everyone else out at the gym. My boyfriend was super impressed with them as well when I let him listen, he guessed they were double the price. I am very happy with this purchase!",5,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
"So, I’ve had these Bluetooth “waterproof” headphones for less than 1 week. My initial opinion was a positive one...once I figured out how to fit them properly they worked great! The volume capacity, bass, noise cancellation and overall sound quality was awesome! I got 48 hours worth of enjoyment before I finally put them to the real test (the main reason I purchased them): wearing them in the shower. I’m one of those people who like to listen to music loudly while I shower. My roommate doesn’t mind the sound of my singing, but apparently the bass is more than a little distracting. So for the first 10 minutes of the shower, they worked just as well as they had in dry conditions. But when it came time to wash my face, I decided to take them out because I figured they’d probably fall out in the process. I set them up on a shelf in the shower, literally the furthest away from the shower head as you can get. After washing my face the earbuds wouldn’t stay put in my ears. I guessed it had something to do with my ears being dry when I’d first put them in and had them stay successfully. Upon stepping out of the shower the first thing I did was wrap them in paper towels cuz I figured they’d need to dry. I then put them back in their case to charge and didn’t attempt to use them again for several hours. That’s when I discovered that the left one had stopped working. Completely. It will blink it’s light while in the case, but as soon as I take it out it’s totally unresponsive. The right one still seems to work, but I didn’t spend $50 for 1 working waterproof earbud. And I haven’t showered with that one because I’m afraid it’ll die too. I purchased the recommended extended warranty at the same time, I’m hoping they’ll get me a pair that will work consistently. And I’ll come back and update/edit this review once it’s been addressed.",2,1,2019-4-19,1,0,0
"Only the right earbud worked. The second device connected every time... however, not a single sound. I was sure the left earbud connected, because the automated voice said “second device paired” and i was able to pause and resume my music using the left earbud (useless regarding sound though). I tried resetting it as mentioned, I followed the manual’s Bluetooth connection/pairing directions to the “t”... nothing.  I’m not one to instantly return a product if I find something complicated: I reset my phone, I “forgot the device”, I did everything.  I cannot rate battery life, sound quality, etc, due to it not working as it is supposed to (as 2 functioning earbuds).",1,1,2019-8-22,1,1,0
Recently purchased these earbuds and though at first it was finicky but once paired properly I was blown away with the sound quality and especially the bass. Recommended tip is to find an ear tip that suits you to get maximum satisfaction.UPDATE**,5,1,2019-8-17,1,1,0
"I was extremely happy with the Tozo T10 earbuds for the first 10 months.  They were perfect for light workouts and using in lawn mowing sound protection earmuffs.  Then the right earbud stopped charging.  All I hear is a distorted message saying to charge it.  When I simply left the right earbud in the charging case, the left one would beep in use, searching for the right one to connect to.So happy, then so disappointed.",3,1,2020-6-1,1,1,0
"They are Waterproof first off. Also, they are lightweight and fit great. They charge really fast and sound amazing. They come with different size ear caps that if you're like me have two different size ear canals then this is great. The pairing is so easy to. The button control is also very easy. I'm telling you if you're looking for reasonable and reliable wireless earbuds then you can't go wrong by purchasing The Tozo T-10 model.",5,1,2020-4-20,1,1,0
"I am surprised at how well the T10 wireless ear buds work. I got them based on a few articles that mentioned them as a good alternative to the expensive name brands that I can't afford right now. I listen to podcasts when I sew, and wanted the wireless so I wouldn't be tied to my phone, or have to deal with more cords. The noise cancelling function does a decent job of muting the sound of the sewing machine.  But I can still hear my husband so it's not perfect. I like that different sizes of rubber ear pieces were provided since one size fits all is usually a lie. The case is compact enough to fit easily in my purse or pocket. The battery life is just ok, but the charging case holds enough power to get me through quite a few podcasts. It doesn't take long to charge these little guys up. The little latch flap where you connect the charging cord is difficult to open at first, but it loosens after about 4-5 openings. The sound is clear. The range is really good. I'm able to get up and move around, or go into another room, and leave my phone on the desk. The customer service is good, too. They've emailed me a couple of times just to ask if I have questions or concerns about the product. Best Buy doesn't do that. Overall, considering my need and usage, the price point is excellent, and the quality is way above my expectations. I'm happy with this purchase.",5,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
"Edit: After a month... Just a month of use, I am a ad to say these earbuds are not functioning as well as they should. The audio cuts out. I cannot connect to more than one device (something my BT headphones can do) and I realized the range on these are under 10ft so if you like to work around your house for example and leave your device in one room, these probably won't work.The manufacturer offers its own warranty which is set up via a qr code on the box and they offer to send you a free gift when you write a review. I wrote my original after a few days of use, submitted it and received a free wireless charger about 1.5 weeks later. That was nice. But then I emailed them about the issues I was having, told them that I was going to edit my review and I've heard nothing. Also, while they have their own warrenty, I never actually got a confirmation number or anything to reference. I got the Amazon protection so I guess I have to use that. Though I might check if I can just return them.",2,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones because I didn't have much time to browse and saw them listed as ""Amazon's Choice"".  I figured they must be pretty good at a price point of $39.99 with a blessing from Amazon.  I was replacing a pair that I had lost which I loved and were significantly cheaper.  I figured the extra few bucks would be worth it for a better product.  When I got them, I was sorely disappointed.  Here's why:The recharging case - Mine is good for about a day whether I use the headphones or not.  After that, the case is basically dead.  It isn't capable of restoring a charge on the headphones even once.  Good headphones will have a case with a robust battery that holds a charge for a long time when not in use and is capable of recharging the headphones multiple times.",1,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0

"Got really tired of my popular ear buds falling out of my ears. Yes they were Airpods...I read many many reviews and came upon these TOZO'S. The reviews on these are true! Took a chance and ordered them! Let me say my ipods don't even come close, chuck them in a drawer, never be used again. These TOZO'S are the best I've ever owned. They stay put in my ears with heavy mountain biking even when I'm sweating like a maniac. The sound quality is what got me the most. Deep big stereo sound with a punchy base took me to my own world. Long battery life and a wireless charging case is perfect. Put the right size ear pieces on my buds and they are super comfortable.

"Ok, honestly I only returned one previous earbud that was awful. It sounded good, but when the receiver on the other end said I sounded choppy with moments of static, so I sent them back. This brand was my actual first choice, but after I missed the awesome sale a week before, it became out of my budget. Tried the other brand, it sucked so I sent it back. Which brought me back to this brand, and I pulled the trigger on the purchase. The sound is much better and the receivers on the other end of my calls hear everything clearly, sometimes too much lol. Also the battery life is great. The only little hiccup for me is that, the right ear bud seems to be the only one that can be paired singularly (I could be doing something wrong too though) But a small price to pay, for a great product. I am very happy with my purchase.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"To start, the headphones do not have a skip track function built in. Given that I use my headphones mostly for listening to music while working out, I cannot recommend them with such a massive oversight. I bought the headphones so that I wouldnt have to keep my phone on me while working out, but these don't solve that problem.The sound quality on the headphones I think is adequate. I have headphones ranging from 25 dollar wired skull candy's to 350 dollar bose noise cancelling headphones and I can say that these headphones, realitively speaking, are the weakest in terms of sound quality. To be more specific, the headphones handle edm and rap very well, but fall very short when trying to handle cymbols and highs present in rock/metal. They seem to clip those sounds.",3,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
Purchased this item a few months back. I rarely use the earbuds. I charged the case and pulled them out to use and they were dead. I charged the case and went to use them a few days later and the earbuds are not working again. The charging case has one light on it as if I’ve been using them again. I purchased a warranty from Amazon that states they cover the item from the date of purchase for 3 years. Amazon says that TOZO is responsible. Then why am I paying for coverage that isn’t covered until after the first year. I hope the seller reaches out to me. I can literally count on one hand the times that I have used this item.

In the morning I pop them in my ear while taking a shower and listen to audiobooks, when I get to work, (I work in a large area with many distraction and people loudly talking) I pop them in and I am able to cancel all the noise. The sound quality is full and very loud with music, I cannot put the volume all the way up, I have a wireless charging pad so I can easily place the case on it charging pad.

"Bought this headset because of 2 reasons : First, so many positive reviews on Amazon and Second, limited time reduced price deal on Amazon. But now I believe it happens to be most of the reviews are either paid or fake. The battery does not last more than 2 / 2.5 hours after a full charge. Automated audio instructions that play inside the headsets are ambiguous without clarity. Instruction manual is basic, IMO one of the worst for an electronic device I have ever seen. Sound quality is above average. This is the only thing I expected to be average due to its price and thats fine. Still I don’t understand how others have reviewed it saying excellent sound quality and someone compared with Bose and Sony. Funny indeed. Noise cancellation is due to the structure of the earbuds since its an inear design. No extra noise cancelling tech. It is overrated in Amazon which misguided me and I believe many others like me.

I don't know if there is some sort of connection issue, and I've tried disconnecting and reconnecting it, but I can't seem to get it to sound clear on my end during calls.It might just be an issue with the call program because it tends to sound clear with things like YouTube, but I'm just unsure.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0

Then I saw these relatively cheap Tozo wireless ones and decided to give them a try. I absolutely love them. No cord to fail, no lightning adapter, I can charge my phone while I use them, and I can use each one separately! After a few months my wife started using mine so I came back to get another set.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"These are top dollar ear buds with a low price point. The sound quality is on point with deep base and clear vocals. I havent had any experience with robotic or crackling sounds. The bluetooth connection is super smooth and quick. As soon as I take the ear bud out and up to my ear, I hear the connection complete prompt. So when I grab my phone to pick a song it's already connected and ready to jam to.So far the only issues I really have is the button on the earbuds and the battery life. In order for me to use the button I have to pull it out of my ear, otherwise all I'm going is jamming the bud farther into my ear causing extreme discomfort and even pain. There's also no option to skip or go to previous track with these. Although that's a small detail, I find it very frustrating to have to pull my phone out everytime I want to change the song.",4,1,2019-12-31,1,1,0
"I have had countless sets of wireless headphones. I would rank these right at the top. They have excellent bass response. The overall sound quality is on par with my Air Pods and the Bose I've had. The other great aspect to these headphones is the noise cancellation: especially helpful mowing the lawn or other noisy activities. They do a great job blocking out external noise interference. I specifically wanted wireless charging and this case definitely delivered.I did have a earbud fail after 3 months, TOZO support was very responsive getting the situation resolved! I have been very pleased with other TOZO purchases, especially screen protectors and cases.",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"I really like these earbuds.  I've used them extensively for a few months and have never had an issue connecting.  Pull them out of the case and they connect to my phone.  I usually only use one at time (biking, running, at work in the office) and like that I can use them in either ear.Battery life is about 5 - 6 hours for the ear piece itself.  It would be nice if it were longer but since I only use one at a time I just switch them out.",5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
"I had originally given these earbuds a 2-star rating for the left earpiece losing connection to the right, primary, earpiece whenever I moved my head. Customer service reached out via email the next day apologizing for the poor performance and only asked for original order number so they could send another pair free of charge. I replied and received the second set the following day. I've been using these for the past couple of days and I can say that I""m impressed with the performance now. When I'm watching training videos and only using one piece, I'm using the left one and I'm not having any dropped connections to the primary. When at work I like to tune people out by listening to music and the sound quality is right up there with the more expensive headphones I use for gaming. 5-stars for customer service and 5-stars for how the product performs.",5,1,2019-6-27,1,1,0
"This will be my third set of earbuds in the last 2 months. My main issue has been extra noise being picked up when having a phone conversation. That problem has been cleared up. The other issue I've had is wearability. What does that mean to me. I've tried the wired headsets but I usually only keepnone in at a time. So the other side gets hung up in my shirt or is hanging down my back. Trying to turn my head quick to find the other side is caught is not a comforting feeling at all. So I can wear one at a time to let the other charge or both when I workout and not have to hear anything distracting me. Instructions were clear and percise. I was synced and making calls in a two minutes. The other feature is the case. It feels sturdy and we'll put together. And the lid closes tight and it has a magnet to keep it closed. The rubbery texture asures me that I want lose my grip on it. Lastly when I place the ear buds back in the case the magnet pulls then in place every time, letting me know that are in the correct placement for charging. I'm very happy with this purchase for what I paid for them. But the best thing about it all. I ordered then this morning and they were at my door step before 5.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,1
"I have nothing but good things to say about these wireless earbuds they fit correctly make a good seal with your ear canal, they have a lot of good features especially for someone who rides motorcycles like me not having to worry about a little rain oh, and also I like the fact that they have buttons on them and aren't capacitive touch.I also thank with the coupon that I used this is one of the best value bluetooth earbuds out there and I've tried a few of the cheaper ones, please read the Skullcandy ones that are almost twice as much.",5,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0

But important to me so I just canceled the order. Kept looking at others but I liked that the color blended with my skin and needed waterproof so I gave it a try a month later and they came on the day promised. I use them in the pool swimming and exercising and so far they work well. I hardly ever dunk my head in the water so can't say if they hold up for that but for me sound is good, long battery time, look good in my ears.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"I bought these because my Plantronics Voyager got lost somehow. I decided that I'd give some wireless earbuds a shot. These had great reviews so I ordered them. Amazon sent them right away with no issues.The box was nice and the instructions were fairly clear but the grammar was bad pegging this as a foreign product. I don't worry about that too much but a lot of times Chinese made products are made cheaply and the quality control is non existent. When I read documentation with broken ""engrish"" I get a little put off. It's my opinion if you're a serious international business you'll spend the money to have a fluent proof reader edit your literature. That's my own personal opinion, you might not care about that.",4,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"I had previously purchased several earbuds only to find that they were not suit to my preference. Most of these earbuds whether had bad sound effect or just frequently dropped bluetooth connection. I was about to consider purchasing an Apple earbud, which is cost more than one hundred bucks that I found this Tozo T10 on Amazon. I decided to give it a try before heading to Apple. To my astonishment, the sound was incredibly awesome, the treble and especially the bass were effectively echoed to my ears. I have used it for several days to listen to news and music, and every time I listened I was satisfied with the structure of this earbuds. The price is reasonable and the sound were great, what else could I wish for?",5,1,2019-10-17,1,0,1
These ear buds are total garbage. The sound quality is mediocre at best. The battery life is horrible and it doesnt noise cancel anything unless you want to go deaf. The whole thing feels like cheap plastic but the absolute worst part is the battery life. These things dont even last four hours! Maybe two on good day which is not enough for someone who listens to music almost all day at work. Do not buy these unless you really want to add to your junk drawer collection.,1,1,2020-7-13,1,1,0
"These are fantastic. I purchased these for wearing in the evening when I'm doing my skincare routine, so I can listen to podcasts after my husband has already gone to sleep. I needed something that wouldn't get in the way with wires/cords - even the kind that are ""wireless"" but are connected with a loop that goes around behind your head wouldn't work for me, because I apply all my skincare products to the back of my neck too! Don't neglect your neck, ladies! ;-) So I needed something that would allow true freedom of movement and not interfere in any way, but that would also STAY PUT in my ears. These definitely do that. It's great that they come with different sizes to custom fit your ear - I have small ears, and the smallest size is perfect for me! Very comfortable, and they stay put throughout my whole routine, even in pulling my headband on/off past my ears over my head.The sound quality is great on these, just as good as my Apple earbuds if not better! I'm no audiophile, but even I recognized that it was noticeably clearer and smoother. The noise cancellation is also very good - not so over the top that I'm deaf to the rest of the world and oblivious if anything important happens and I am needed, but just right so that I hear what I'm listening to perfectly without other noise competition.",5,1,2019-9-19,1,0,0
"Headphones are great sound wise and comfort wise. However I hate that all the shortcuts on the headphones are only geared towards making calls. I wish I could adjust the volume and skip songs without using my device and could just tap the headphones like the ones that come with my iPhone. It’s annoying because on hikes and stuff I usually have my phone in my bag and I have to keep taking it out. The shortcuts on the headphones are only good for speed dial. I do see that there’s a newer version by the same company with the features I want, so I’m going to try those.",3,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"I ordered this product because my husband researched online and saw the best reviews and the price for these earbuds were not expensive, but of great value and quality. Once I used his earbuds after they were ordered, and I tested the sound using a cellphone, a smartwatch, and a portable bluetooth radio, and found the audio and media sound to be just what I wanted, I purchased a pair also. The charge holds great and we were able to wear these while working out on a treadmill, cooking, walking, or just about anything. They are lightweight but give a hefty sound. I would recommend purchase. I am 100 percent satisfied. But do not believe that you will receive a free wireless charger if you say that you are 100 percent satisfied with these earbuds. Trust me. That's not true.",5,1,2019-5-21,1,0,0
"This is a great set if earbuds that are IPX8 waterproof. To test, I put them under the kitchen faucet for a few minutes, and they work just fine...which means that you can take them into your shower without any worries. The storage box, which doubles as an additional battery, is also waterproof. You can attach the included lanyard and hang it around your neck for convenience.Sound quality is on par with other high end earbuds (I also have Sony, paid at least 5x) as long as you fit the buds snugly in your ear canals. It comes with different size silicone tips, so it is best to use the one with the best fit for deep bass and clear treble. Overall, these are well-made, extremely affordable ear buds for everyday use that I highly recommend.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,1
"The first one of these had an intermittent problem of the left earbud momentarily losing Bluetooth connection.  This lasted a fraction of a second; on average, about 3-4 times per song.  It kind of killed the music experience.  Amazon sent me a replacement; but the left earbud on the replacement lost Bluetooth connection for several seconds at a time, which was totally unacceptable regardless of how many times it occurred per song.Other than that, the case is really cool looking and is very functional.  It will recharge the earbuds about 3 times.  The user instructions are - as typical - not very good; but they at least give you the general idea of how to set it up and achieve Bluetooth pairing.  After that, it's just a matter of persistence in making it work.",1,1,2019-8-16,1,1,0
"UPDATE--So they remedied the situation by ""upgrading"" me to a pair of the T6s.  Not an upgrade on sound, battery life, yes, but not as bassy and lower volume.  Plus the controls are different and not a good different.  But I am unable to review them.  So I'll up these a star.  ---",3,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"Worked great for 3 months. Battery lasted about 4 hours, which was the only drawback and would have gotten this product 4 stars. However, now anytime I take the buds out of the charging box, the left bud turns on, beeps twice and goes silent, flashing red and blue lights as if it was trying to pair. I have tried to fix the issue but nothing has worked. Seems a common problem that I told myself wouldn't happen to me... It did, they're garbage now.  0/10 do not bother.UPDATE: Seller has emailed me 13 times since my review, eight of those in the last 5 days. Seller has acknowledged that they have a defective batch and are working with the manufacturers to fix the problems. However, they have not made attempts to stop selling the bad batch and are instead offering upset customers promises of Amazon gift cards in exchange for deleting bad reviews so that their sale volume can stay high and get them through the last of the defective products. Unlike this defective batch of an otherwise (probably) good product, I am not for sale.

"As others have said, the sound and feel of the earbuds are amazing, as I didn’t know what to expect with complete wireless earbuds.  The sound every bit as good as my wired Sony’s!  One thing that nobody else mentioned is the charging case they come with... it is a heavy duty design and well thought out.  This is important to me because they’ll be living in my book bag and get bounced around a lot.  The hinge and cover seem designed to withstand a fair amount of abuse compared to pictures I’ve seen of others.The only negative that I’ve noticed is a slightly slow pairing when taking them out of the case, but that is most likely because of my very old iPhone 6.  Even so, I’m up and running in about a minute.",5,1,2019-8-6,1,0,0

The sound quality is great and while I haven’t utilized the waterproof part of it, it’s a great option to have. I’m a knitter and I love these for listening to my audio books while I knit. They’re also great for listening to music while cleaning the house when someone’s watching tv. Only upset the pink ones weren’t available when I ordered.

"Still can't believe how great these Tozo earbuds are. After buying these, I bought another set of T10s in a different color because they are that good. (And yes I paid real money for both -- not one of those 'get free stuff and write some bs review' situations.)  Anyway, why would you spend way more money for something else. These earbuds have excellent sound quality, and surprisingly good bass, not flat like many others I've used. Perfect wireless earbuds for my needs. They block out sound quite a bit due to being actual in-ear buds, you know...like earplugs...duh. Battery life is pretty darn good too -- I usually listen to Pandora or watch videos/movies and these earbuds will run about 3 hours on average before I need to pop them into the charging box thing (included) which holds like 3 or more full charges.

"I both like and dislike these headphones. The sound is decent for the price, and I find the noise cancelling adequate. I had purchased these to use when running, and I would give them a 6.5/10 for staying in during my runs.. not awful, but I do have to adjust them once or twice. The biggest thing I wish I had known is that in order for them to work, BOTH of them have to be out of the case and they need to be within a pretty short distance from one another. When I run, I only wear one headphone (I like to be sure I can hear any road noise, etc.). Because of the above mentioned feature I end up having to carry one of the headphones in my pocket while I run, which is slightly inconvenient. I'd almost rather just deal with the headphone cord bouncing around while I run than worry that I'm going to lose the left earbud out of my pocket. Not a bad product, just not ideal for my use.",3,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"Despite the company/seller being dedicated to rectifying bad reviews, the tozo earbuds are just not well made. They were willing to give me a refund in the form of an Amazon gift card long after the return window for my first purchase. And I thought maybe the first one that I bought was just a fluke and I could use the refund to buy a replacement. BOTH devices eventually stopped working in the exact same way, even in similar time windows. The left earpiece always goes out and stops working and eventually the right one will follow suit. A big waste of time. many of these wireless headphone companies have convinced me that wired headphones are the way to go. It is wasteful to have to buy a new device every 6 to 8 months, when wire headphones last much longer and are much more reliable.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,1,0
For the price these are definitely pretty good earbuds.  They are indeed waterproof (I wore them in the shower to test that out). I only have a couple of minor complaints.  They didn't seem to stay in my ears super well when I was moving around.  Not the end of the world for me but if you plan to wear them jogging or working out it could be an issue.  Although that could be just the shape of my ear perhaps.  The battery is about average compared with others.  All in all they are definitely worth the money and are better than other similarly priced ones I've had in the past.,5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0

Lost one of the earbuds and accidentally washed in the washing machine which is pretty bad but then I also ran it through the dryer for an hour and this was after having not charged the earbuds for three weeks.  And after all that I found it and put it in my ear and it powered right up and connected to my iPhone and played beautiful quality audio.The problem of course is I can’t swim in a pool with it but I can wear it to listen to audiobooks in the shower but no immersion without it turning off on you which I assume the manufacturer designed to do that so as to discourage people submerging it which makes me sad because I bought it to swim in was why I wanted them in the first place.,5,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0

"When I first tried out these headphones I was amazed. The sound quality is amazing, and while listening to them that night the battery life was great too.  But, besides those two things, they are absolutely awful. For instance if you have your phone in your pocket and the earbuds in, they will constantly be blipping in and out. If you are sitting by the pool and your phone isn't basically a foot away from your head you at almost the same height you will never have a consistent signal. If you're working out and lay your phone down on the ground, your connection will slip in out still. If you're running and happen to carry your phone in the same hand that your fit bit is on, you won't be able to listen to anything for all the ins and outs. I had initially been extremely excited about these, water proof and bluetooth. Perfect for working out or floating in the pool with. I was unfortunately extremely disappointed in that after several attempts to use I have found out that they hardly work at the pool at all. As well as besides that, if the phone they are connected to isn't within 5 feet with an unblocked ""line of sight"" between phone and head phones, as well as you not being that active, they don't work. Now to clarify what I mean by not working or blipping out, etc, is that they cut out. They don't disconnect from the device, you just lose the music playing in the earbuds. The song does not actually stop, so when the earbuds allow you to keep listening you're at a completely different part of the song. Most Bluetooth headphones/earbuds only do this when you walk out of range. These do it all the time. In fact I'm a tall guy and they do it if I'm standing still and the phone is at my feet. On that same note while they do fit in the ear pretty well, they easily fall out if you're working out. Very disappointed, and very unhappy since I have to now wait on new ones so I can have music while working out, or at work.",1,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
Great sound with base and mid range asside from the occasional fade out between the ear buds. One flaw is that you can only control stop or play. There is no advance or backup/repeate  feature with the earbuds.I have used many earbuds in the past and these fit comfortably in my ears where others have failed with a tight fit. They are better sounding than the more expensive or fancier brands listed for sale on amazon. Infact these almost have the sound quality of a good pair of over ear headphones.,4,1,2019-6-9,1,0,0
"Got these as I was trying to find my first pair of true wireless that work well enough to use all day long. These are not it. Battery life is very poor, definitely less than what is advertised. The blue-tooth signal range is only about 10-15 ft, fitment and design are not great as they constantly feel like they need to be adjusted or they fall out. The fitment and comfort may be more of a personal thing but it was an issue for me. Good things would be that they come with a 1 year manufacture's warranty, the carrying/charging case seems to be pretty well made as well and the wireless charging aspect of the case is actually pretty nice especially if you already have QI phones and chargers.",2,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
"Case is small, effective, and works to recharge.  Earbuds are small, reasonably lightweight for what they are.  They sound OK.  But I think where they shine is their size and weight distribution.  These fit in the ears (with one of the various size inserts included) well, without feeling like a sudden abrupt movement will tip them out.  I nearly lost a pair of fancy Sony WF-1000XM3 when they flopped out of my ear while running.  These don't seem to want to.  And let's be honest, if these did fall out, I wouldn't be out ~$200.

These things died well before I had to fuel up, 2.5 hrs. That is unacceptable. I have others that I charge twice a week because of their extended play back time. The sound quality and volume is pretty good but that is about it. Ok, recharge time is decent as well but considering it doesn’t have to charge much go figure. I wouldn’t recommend these.

Read and followed the instructions again and they still slip out.I can’t speak for battery life. They do seem to have good sound quality and aren’t very heavy.

"This are a muy buy, been trying many different brands of ear buds with little satisfaction. I received these and the minute I turned them on, I was hooked.

I love that they are wireless and begin to pair with my phone as soon as I take them out of the base. Also the confirmation that both sides have been connected leaves out any doubt. Phone calls are easy to answer and very clear. The carrying case is very durable and the small size makes it easy to slip into a bag or pocket for on-the-go. The shipping box and packaging are also very impressive. Also, they were charged when I received them so I could use them right away. I have to say again how pleased I am with the different sized ear caps.. Probably my favorite feature.

Also, the charging box never really turns off so I feel like when I’m not using the buds and I have them sitting in there, the battery of the box just drains because it’s constantly charging the buds? I’m the type to use my buds until they die, and I prefer not to hook them into a charger constantly when they don’t need to be juiced up yet. Still learning, but overall I really like the headphones. :)",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"UPDATE: seller contacted me and sent a complete replacement (complete charger and earbuds) )which works perfectly with the three wireless chargers I have.  I do like the earbuds and are great for walking and hiking.  Seller did follow up which is another plus ... too many times they just ignore you.  Great customer service after my initial contact.  Described issue with charger failing charge on 3 different makes/capacity wireless chargers could only charge with cable.  Seller: You may using a wireless charger incompatible with T10, we recommend you try our TOZO wireless charger.  DoD trip I took earbuds & charger.  Failed to charge on various pads in vehicles & kiosks.  Reason I purchased was not only for the earbuds but the need NOT TO TAKE MORE CHARGERS WITH ME. ...",5,1,2019-5-25,1,0,0
"So the rumors are true. The left ear bud constantly cuts in and out. If you’re listening to your device from your pocket or in another room. If your device is in front of you, when you put these in, the seem to work perfect until you leave that room or turn around and then the left ear bud cuts in and out.",3,1,2019-9-10,1,2,0
I bought these to be able to take calls and listen you music while at work. I own a painting company so my hands are usually full or im on a ladder. These have awesome sound and battery life is as long as a airpod (my worker has a set of airpods and we tested it out) The only thing is they do not stay in my ear as well as I would like they to. I might try switching ear piece size to see if that helps. I can promise you these things are water resistant (I say proof) because I had my right ear piece fall into a can of paint and I took it out ran over to a sink and washed it off and popoed it right back into my ear and it would flawlessly. Awesome product for the price thats for sure. Recharage time isnt long either,5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"Get a wireless charger separate, so you can charge the case right from the wireless charging pad. The earbuds can then be charged from within the case and connect automatically with your phone, once the case is opened. I've tried AirPods and all sorts of different ear buds and Tozo's are easily my favorite.If you find that sound only comes out of one earbud at a time. Unpair the ear bud(s) and re-pair with only the right bud. This connects to the left ear bud by itself and gets you sound in both buds.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,1,0
"Yes, they are waterproof, easy to operate, fairly small, etc.However, these earbuds are ALWAYS dropping the Bluetooth signal. I have disconnected and reconnected many times, viewed suggestions, tried many different ""solutions "" suggested from multiple sites  and these CRAP earbuds simply will not play anything for longer than 30 seconds without one or both speakers dropping out.",1,1,2020-6-13,1,2,0
Professional dog walker here.  I've had these for a week and am extremely pleased with this  impulse buy.The sound quality is pretty good. Great for the price.,5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"Two stars because the sound seems to be good and they paired to my phone easily, but these would not stay in my ears. I suppose if you have large ears they might work, but no matter which size of the changeable in-ear piece I tried, they popped out within 30 seconds. I turned them backward according to the instructions but had to jam them in so far as to be painful to have a chance of these earbuds staying in for a minute or two. And then they still fell out. Of course I discarded the packaging after pairing and charging them, my fault, so now I'm stuck with a useless $40 item. I should have just shelled out for the Apple ones that I know fit me.",2,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"I am very happy with this purchase.  I took my time searching Amazon for the right pair, as for me the size and weight were very important, I did not want a set of ear buds which stick out of my ears.  T10 are very compact and light while delivering an outstanding sound, the fact they are water proof is an extra bonus for me.  The build quality is very good, each ear bud sits firmly in it's position in the charging case held by a magnet, and LED indicating lights let you know exactly when they are charged.  The fit is very good and the ear buds come with multiple sets of ear pieces which ensure a great fit.  Once I settled on my size ear pieces they held my ear buds in place and I have not had any issues of them falling out.  I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend them to anyone.",5,1,2019-5-19,1,0,0
"These earbuds sound very good, and they fit securely in my ears so that I have no worries about them falling out when running or when at the gym.  They seal out environmental noise (so useful when the gym is blasting music I don't like).  They also have proven to be fully waterproof in the shower & the hot tub.One tip on sound & connection quality: I saw a one-star review on here referring to the sound cutting out. That reviewer noted that the sound / connection would cut out when ""line of sight"" between his phone or smartwatch and the right earbud was blocked by his body or head.  He had to make sure the right earbud was on the same side of his body as the sound transmitting device.  I solved that problem with my Samsung S8 (Bluetooth 5.0) by turning on a Bluetooth option called DUAL AUDIO (Connections-Bluetooth-Advanced-Dual Audio).  I recommend making sure your phone uses Bluetooth 5.0 and has that option before buying.  Otherwise fully recommend this product.",4,1,2019-7-26,1,1,0
"I overall enjoy these earphones. The noise quality is great, and it cancels out noise well. I use these while running and cleaning around the house. I'm trying to get the volume dialed in so that I can potentially wear one earbud while working as a massage therapist. I also LOVE that you can charge the case and headphones at the same time on a wireless charger! So convenient!One thing that I was not impressed with was there were some typos in the directions and occasionally the directions to get the earbuds synced to your device were a bit vague. My boyfriend is a wiz at figuring electronics out and he has them working in perfect order now!",4,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0
"When I first looked at the reviews and how many of them I thought, this looks like a great cheaper alternative to Apple airpods especially since I have a Samsung device. When they came in the mail they were very sharp looking. The case looked good and came in a nice sealed plastic covering. I really liked the wireless charging feature since I have a charging pad for my S9. I charged them for the time suggested (around 4 hours) and proceeded to use them in the house. They were a little bulkier than I anticipated for being in your ear but they stayed in my ear pretty well. Don't try to compare them to Airpods as they aren't as sleek and the case isn't either.Pairing was easy and worked well. You pair the R earbud to the phone and the L earbud pairs to the R earbud. Walking around the house with my phone in my pocket the sound in my L earbud fluctuated a bit but I didn't think anything of it. I then went to the gym during the week at a busy time. I had a pair of LG headphones ($100) that fell apart after about 1 year and I didn't want to wait for warranty.",2,1,2019-8-31,1,0,0
"I've tried a few budget wireless earbuds and these are among the worst. Battery life is terrible, can't last an entire 8 hour shift at work even without continuous play just having them out of the case seems to drain the batteries considerably. On top of that you'll be lucky to get one full charge out of the case before you have to plug it in as well, I'm suspecting this thing dies before it even fully charges the earbuds given how quickly they run out. Also very inconvenient that they cannot be used independently of each other, you can use only the right ear but not only the left. Not happy with this purchase at all.",1,1,2020-8-5,1,1,0

"Decent fit and pretty good sound. About average to any other wireless earbuds, especially those in this price range.What drops these to no good for me are two things: 1) battery life - for me, they're only lasting about 2.5 hours on a single charge. Far less than others I've tried. 2) connectivity - other earbuds in this range occasionally drop signal or briefly  sputter out for a second while in use. These do that way too frequently.",2,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"I really like the sound and performance of these ear buds.  They do a great job of reducing the outside sounds which makes what I am listening to clearer and better.  They make listening to things on public transit bearable.The main drawback I am finding is that the battery is constantly discharging.  If I lightly bump the case, that is enough to momentarily break the electrical contact of the earbuds.  When that happens, they power on.  Even just closing the lid can do this.  I don't even know they power on because they don't connect to my Bluetooth.  What ends up happening is that it just drains the earbud and the case battery.  A day or two later, they are dead.",3,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"EDIT: Okay, I've taken away an additional 2 stars. pairing these earbuds to be used simultaneously is much more of a hassle than I'd like it to be. In addition, these earbuds have one of the most annoying features; in my experience, if the left earbud is not placed in your ear in a precise way, no audio will come out of it and it will instead play a clicking noise every couple seconds. It happens way too often for me to actually enjoy using these during workout.Sound is great, the feel is great. I bought them for working out and the do stay in. My only complaint is that they don't go as loud as I'd like them to. Like I said, I bought them for working out and ""getting in the zone"". I like to bang my head to Demon Hunter and I don't get that loud in your face volume I need with these ear buds.",2,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
These earbuds are a huge disappointment. I suppose I only have myself to blame. The description pointed out the extremely low charge time. I found a charge to last about 3 hours. That is truly underwhelming to say the least. The sound quality is as bad. While the noise canceling is fine the sound quality is lacking to the point that it cancels out that positive comment. There are two good things to say about these earbuds: they fit nicely in the ear and the case is of a pleasant design with a quality build. Those positives mean nothing if the things needs to be recharged every few hours and the sound quality is poor. I hate I bought these and have had to buy another brand to replace them. I hope this saves someone else $40 or so dollars.,2,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"These headphones might be the best headphones I've purchased in years. I usually buy earbuds for their practicality in terms of a function during gym workouts. Under those circumstances I've had to sacrifice sound quality and durability for functionality during workouts (e.g. staying in ears, not being an impediment because of discomfort). These blue ear buds meet all that and quality. I was amazed at the sound quality after going without. I was simply looking for wireless for gym purposes exclusively and now I'm beyond ecstatic that I get excellent sound quality AND practicality and functionality for my workouts! I would highly recommend these!",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
I was considering air pods as a gift to myself for earning my hard earned income tax return but i stumbled upon these on amazon and read the reviews which were awesome. I hence decided to give them a try and the p[rice was also much cheaper than what i was going to pay for the air pods. i have to admit i am impressed by these. Sound quality is amazing and the case has wireless charging which i love since i have decided to go as wireless as possible with my setups. I am yet to test these in water and i probably wont but I trust that they are as waterproof as advertised. Get these earbuds if you are considering wireless ones and i promise you will be blown away by the bass.,5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"Bought these headphones for my boyfriend for his birthday, really excited about the waterproof feature since he uses them at the gym and out and about. I couldn’t even been mad when we accidentally washed AND dried them one day (didn’t notice that one of them was in his jacket pocket). All he did was charge them up again and bam works good as new! This has happened twice now. Really glad I skipped on the AirPods for this gift, these headphones have been a good investment! Quality not too bad when I call him, they charge up pretty fast and he seems to like them!",4,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0
"Just got them today. So far I love them! There’s 4 sizes of rubber plugs but I seem to be fine with whatever size came already on them. Sound wise these are actually really good, I’m impressed so far and happy. Sound clarity is excellent. I played one of those bass tracks you’d use to test the range of a subwoofer and no exaggeration it was like I had my head laying on a sub. I can FEEL the bass Between my ears (then again there’s lots of empty space lol). I can’t speak to the battery life as they are on their very first charge but if there’s any issues I will def post back. I got these to replace my old waterproof “wireless” wired buds (I like wearing in shower) and they weren’t affected at all when I washed my hair. Finally, noise cancellation. As I write this my kid is having some sort of what I can only assume is a seizure or something wherein he’s making some gawdawful noises for whatever reason and all I hear is some smooth sax and no kid. Unless something happens to them I would absolutely recommend these buds!",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"These are great to listen to music anywhere! They do work well when sweating and showering as you can still keep the beats going. However, they do not work well for talking. The other party can barely hear you and you have to talk above normal volume which makes you stand out when around others. No whispering or they simply can't hear you. Even when talking loud, the other person says you sound far away. For 50 bucks they are great for no wires comfort. I am tired of having a dangling cord and having to worry about the 3.5mm jack getting busted if i sit on the phone wrong. Overall, not bad but just know that calls aren't going to be stellar but do work in a pinch of you can talk loud. Noise cancellation is fair and having 4 inserts makes them fairly easy to find a fit for your ears.",4,1,2019-6-19,1,1,0
"Really like these.  I bought them to use in the pool and hot tub I use after my workouts.  I have  a great set of Bose SoundSport Pulse Wireless Headphones I use when I train and didn't expect these waterproof headphones to have good sound quality.  Especially at this price.  I was surprised at the quality of the sound and the fit of these earbuds.  I've had them in underwater without issue, keeping in mind the Bluetooth does not work underwater.  Bluetooth drops when you go under the water and comes right back on when you emerge.  I definitely recommend these.",5,1,2019-7-29,1,1,0
"So upon receiving my earbuds i let them charge and immediately tested them for sound quality. They were great, they do not cancel out noise completely but that is okay for me since I am a person that likes to be aware of my surroundings. They fit just right and i like that hey come with different size rubber earbud pieces too. One concern i had was when I made a phone call to test out the sound quality on both ends. My cousin could barely hear me, in her words, “it sounded like I was under a rock” lol Frustrated i wanted to return them or exchange them, but something made me check again by calling my dad and my sister-in-law. It was loud and clear with both calls!!! Guess my cousin could use a pair of tozo10 earbuds for Christmas lol",5,1,2019-8-8,1,0,0
"You might as well be playing music or taking a call through your phone’s speaker. There is virtually zero noise cancellation with these headphones. They are also a bit bulky, but otherwise cute and easy to use.UPDATE: Support contacted me and offered an upgraded version of their product-- the TOZO T6. The upgraded headphones are better than the original pair I bought in every way. They are smaller and sexier, have better noise cancellation (though only when wearing them), and the case looks like an Airpods case. I increased my rating from a 3 to a 4 based on the company's support and the new headphones.",4,1,2020-5-10,1,0,0

About a week later I received another pair from the vendor even though my money was refunded and I did not ask for a replacement. I’ve tested the new pair for about four weeks and have not had one issue with connectivity at all. As I suspected the original pair I received just happen to be a bad pair. I would highly recommend these buds. For the price point the sound quality is good, battery life is good and customer service is great. If you have an issue with your buds don’t do like me and just return them, reach out to the seller and they will do everything they can to resolve your issue.",4,1,2019-7-8,1,1,0
"The noise cancelling is legit.  I have to take them out in order to hear anything, even when nothing is playing. I’ve only had them for a couple of days, but the only thing I really dislike about these is the blinking light when they’re in use.  I listen to audio books in bed and had to go back to a wired pair because they were driving my husband crazy.((**Updating my review after another week of use)) I cannot stand these.  When switching between wired ear buds & air pods (*pod- lost 1, hence this purchase) the sound quality is very apparent.  I also dislike that they do not disconnect if removed from your ear. They will continue to play until you manually pause.  I mentioned the flashing Bluetooth light in my previous review but I simply cannot get used to it.

When they were working together, I pretty much only use them for max 1 hour a day, and they can last almost 2 hours maximum from one charge. And I did not use them daily, cus I do not like using earbuds. The sound quality is ok since I am not picky for it at all. 40 dollars was used for just an experience of how it feels like with a cheap ""amazon's choice"". I don't know how to feel it now.

"I was excited to get these for the price. They sound good when you have them in and they do an ok job of noise cancellation but you can still hear outside noises when you're volume is any lower then deafening. You can use them individually while one is charging in the dock but they tend to get a bit sensitive and will beep at you for awhile, it will finally stop and you can enjoy your music. They stay in your ear pretty well but I wouldn't be to vigorous with them or they will fall out. I have not tested the waterproof. Battery life is pretty poor. From full charge to dead in about a week with little use. Honestly I'm not sure if that's norm for wireless earbuds but it can be frustrating considering my wireless headset will stay charged for over a month.

Pairing is easy, as soon as you take the earbuds out of the case, they power on.  You then just pair the right earbud to your device and the left will automatically pair.  The case is also really nice, there are magnets on the top of the lid and on the case itself so when closing the case you get a pleasant snap when the two sets of magnets attract each other.

I wear them when mowing the lawn and I can’t even hear the lawnmower with the volume turned down to 1/4 or lower of their capabilities. I’m typically a volume all the way up blaring out my eardrums kind of person. But with these that is too loud! I can’t believe I just said that!

"I bought these early Dec 2019, in gray, because of the reviews and they are supposed to be waterproof. Overall, i'm very satisfied by the product. The case is sturdy with a magnet lid, and has a battery in it in which the earbuds click (magnetize) nicely into to charge. I haven't stretched the battery life, but I used them frequently across two days, putting them in the case after each use, and only drained half the battery case. They fit well, and aren't obtrusive. After putting them in the recommended way I twisted them around and found they seated better another angle. Connection via bluetooth is a no brainer. Though I haven't tested all aspects of this, I do know that you can connect one or the other (and charge the other) at the same time. The multi-function button is easy to use, and fortunately is not touch, but is click. 1 Mo update: phone call quality is much better than anticipated, I have found no issues while using both ear buds. With 1 only the other person couldn't hear me clear enough.My gym experience: I had no issues that I might have suspected. The gym is go to is smaller (maybe 3000k sq. ft), so I set my phone with my coat on the rack and was able to wander throughout my workout without any connection issues.

Ive also grown to use these on my pc so i can listen to youtube vids or something while im in the kitchen and not miss out on whats being said. With airpods being 150+$ (with admittedly advanced, very apple'ish features) these are very high quality for the buck. In fact your gonna spend about 45$ to 50$ just to get the sound quality of over the ear phones in most cases so the pricing is competitive.The only thing ive heard from others is to make sure you pull out the right earbud first so you dont have to press and hold the buttons to resync but thats a super minor issue and once its a habit that doesnt even matter anymore.",5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,1
Wow. Iam truly impressed. Normally I spend $50-100 on a pair of nice quality wired earbuds but I figured that since I hate carrying around a separate cord(and I keep losing it) for my iPhone I would try some Bluetooth earbuds...Sound quality is very nice and rich. I would say that these are the perfect rap/hip-hop earbuds. The bass is deep and hits very well. While you can definitely enjoy some other genres. I feel the bass slightly overpowers some delicate guitar riffs and snare sessions; sometimes even a singer with a deep voice can seem too deep.

"Great value. Sound quality in about 80% of my Bose headphones. This set-up is a LOT cheaper, more compact  and easy to use. The trick little case will charge them 3x before you need to recharge the case. It will charge wireless too. If you want true noise canceling (to sleep on a flight, Etc), this is not the best option. If you want OK or better sounding , very compact, affordable earphones for travel, this is a great choice. Works with my LG smart TV too. Can watch TV w/o bothering the family. I can watch about 3hrs of TV rather loudly before the battery goes dead.",5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"After two weeks of use, the right ear lost audio, and the left ear I fear may be on its last limbs... I really wanted it to work. It feels good, looks and sounds good; I can deal with the short battery life... but it was a waste of cash... I’m pretty sure the IPX8 is false advertisement. No direct water got into, but I’ve been around steam and humidity. Don’t buy this, save your money.",1,1,2020-6-8,1,1,0
"I have had these headphones now for over a month. At first I was really happy with them. They are Stylish. They fit well in my ears and I love the carrying case.  However, I have noticed lately that the party life last maybe two hours or three at the most and then you have to recharge them  I use them at work and find myself not being able to use these because the battery life is so short. I received email from company soon after this review and was offered an upgraded pair of headphones with new features.  The battery life on this set works great and last all day.  I am very happy with this transaction.",5,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
"I purchased these earbuds for my mom to use at work, but imagine they will get much more use than that. She has to use her cell phone to speak with customers at work and was getting really frustrated trying to talk on the phone and not able to be handsfree to do other stuff. I looked at the various options and this one caught my eye because it was a best seller/highly recommended and on sale too. I had the earbuds delivered as a surprise to my mom and she was so excited.  The earbuds were easy to set up and use, work great, and have good sound quality.  My mom is super happy that she can now take calls on her cell at work and be hands-free.  Very happy with purchase!",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"I love these earbuds because they don't hurt my ears like the hard plastic ones do, and they look much cooler and more discreet. I can wear them all day long without issues, but I switch between two pairs so I can charge them.They are easy to pair with my iPhone and connect right when I take them out of the case. They have been great for the gym and working around the house, because it's much easier to listen to music and podcasts without any wireless.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"I bought this product after my older pair of wired ear buds broke. The left ear bud broke in half from me dropping it while running on a treadmill. Anyway, I decided to go with this product after doing a little bit of snooping around. Right out of the box, it was just as easy as they claimed to pair the headset with your phone. Took no more than 5-10sec. The sound quality was much more acoustic than my old wired pair. This is my first wireless pair ive bought and i couldnt be happier. The thing that i was really satisfied about also was how they fit in my ears. Ive had trouble in the past with finding comfortable earbuds and ones that stay snug in your ears (especially while exercising). Ive went for a run with them recently and they didnt budge one bit! The fact i didnt feel the need to adjust them at all during my run was huge. Definitely would recommended these to anyone looking for a decent pair of earbuds and affordable cost.",5,1,2019-7-7,1,1,0
"Just. WOW. I wanted a pair of earbuds that were wireless and not the weird stupid shape of AirPods. I like in-ear ones. And lemme tell you. Earbuds ALWAYS fall out of my ears. These? NOPE! I’m laying in bed eating and the movement from my jaw isn’t loosening them! The sound quality is just what I want. Is it like you’re sitting at a concert? No. But it sounds good for what they are! Crisp, clear and most importantly, the music plays properly. There isn’t a lag between the earbuds. The controls are easy peasy and so was pairing! I don’t use earbuds for more than a couple hours a day anyway, so I’m happy with the battery life. The charging case fits in the palm of your hand and it’s so easy to carry. I love it <3",5,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"Got these earlier than expected, and was incredibly pleased with the product. Sound quality is fantastic and they fit very well (trust me, I was jumping around enough, they stay right where they are). They’re also really comfy and the noise cancellation is good too. I would definitely recommend these earbuds.3 months later: earbuds still work, but only one at a time. I’ve tried every fix I could find, both through the earbuds and several devices I use them with. With as many people as I found having the same issues, this seems to be a pretty common problem. Many have tried to reach out to the company and have received no response. They still work, both of them. You just get to choose if you want to listen with your right ear or your left. If you put the right one in first, the left won’t work. Left in first, right won’t work. Both at the same time? Well, I guess they choose, but still only one works.",2,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Just got these and was surprised how easy they paired to each other. I had read reviews of other products that discouraged me in wanting wireless buds, until I read reviews for these Tozo buds. Took me a minute to figure out how to pair to my laptop Bluetooth. Sound is good, seems natural and I didn’t notice distortion. These did very little to cancel background noises in my household while I was listening to a video. I didn’t rate the battery life on theses, because I just got them. Just a note: I also bought a pair of the “blue” Tozo 10-they are not really blue, they’re more of a gray color, for anyone wondering about the color.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"This was my first pair above $20, and the quality is night and day. I was pleasantly surprised. The battery life is fine, I listen to podcasts all day at work, one ear phone at a time, and I needed to recharge and switch phones about every 3.5 hours. Not bad! The sound quality is pretty darn good. I have never owned amazing headphones, so compared to my $10 Panasonic wired earphones that I adore, the sound quality was only slightly worse, not as rich. But podcasts sound great. Music is good enough (no complaints).Now for the cons. I tried all the sizes, they did fit in my tiny ears comfortably, but they would fall out pretty easily. If I smiled, or tilted my head, sang, they’d wiggle out. I didn’t like the fact that I needed to push the earphone to use the functions, I essentially had to pull it out to do it or it’d hurt my ear. I also realized how much I wanted the function to skip to the next song or change volume, which these don’t have.",2,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
This could be my best bargain ever on Amazon. Purchased as one of the deals of the day after considering Apple wireless EarPods for over 5 times the price. Have now used for alomost 3 months and liking them more than ever. They link quickly to each other and my iPhone. The sound is amazing for the price...would be amazing for 3 times the price. Love the deep base...great when I am working out in a noisy gym or walking around my community. They fit perfectly in my ear....very comfortable. The charging case is great. Fortunately I had a wireless charging pad as a giveaway from a conference I attended. Charges quickly and case is good for 3 more charges. An all around great purchase.Update....now been using them for almost a year and still incredibly happy with my purchase. Tried Jabra Elites for three times the price and they didn’t come close to delivering the same quality as my Tozos. The ability to just place case on charging pad is a wonderful plus!  Try them....you won’t be disappointed.,5,1,2019-4-4,1,0,0
"If you are like me and don't want to spend the big bucks for AirPods, this is the product for you. I am very impressed with the quality of this item for the price I paid. I have compared them with a friend's AirPods and hear very little difference. I purchased 4 of these in total for my whole family. My college kids are runners and these are working fine for them and stay in place on their runs. I use them for music and also for phone calls when I want to be hands free I highly recommend these to anyone but more importantly for middle school and high school kids! If these get lost or stolen at school it's not as big a deal as losing the much more expensive Apple product.",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
"These are the third pair of buds I have used from different manufacturers, recently using the Geekee 550. I like to use mainly the left bud until out of battery and then switch to the right bud, then place the left one back in the charger for continuous listening. You cannot do that with these because the right bud is a master and they must pair together, then if you place the right bud in the charger you cannot walk away or the left bud will fade out because the master is still paired in the charger. I do not understand why the designers thought this would be workable, but that's my opinion as a designer. Also, I'm of average build and height and I had to use the smallest buds in the pack. The only pros I can point to is the translucent cover is nice so you can see the charging lights with the lid closed and that the case features wireless charging. I will be returning these. Disappointed.",1,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"If you are like me and use these to only workout with then get ready to charge them multiple times a week. I hate that you can’t pick and choose with a switch when you want to charge them. I workout an hour each day and put them back in the case after and they always start to recharge even tho they are nearly full. So by the 3rd day of use or 3 hours of use you have to recharge the whole case or they will die/turn on. They sound great and are awesome to use but only good if you use them for the the full charge cycle then plug them to charge.Update: customer service reached out to me and informed me I might of had a defective product and sent me out a brand new one. A1 customer service, would recommend product.",1,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"I've owned these for about a week.  Nice packaging.  The case is nice and seems to be well made.  Haven't tried the wireless charging yet.  The sound quality is great.Note:  When I first started using them, I thought the sound was ok.  After playing around with the different sizes, I landed on the next size up.  Doing so totally changed the sound quality.  The bass hits hard and the sound quality sounds like its in your head.",5,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"This was my first set of wireless earbuds, and while I was hoping the glowing reviews would mean they were more up to snuff than the lackluster offerings of yesteryear that had kept me from going wireless, they just didn't pan out. A couple of big issues mean that if I had to advise anyone else, I would tell them to give these a pass for now.First and most important is the fit. These have small round deformable in ear tips, just like my personal favorite wired earbuds, while the rest of the oval shaped unit sits outside the ear. Theoretically, the snug fit of the buds helps by cutting out outside noise and firmly holding the unit inside the ear, lest it fall out. Helpfully, they even provide a plethora of tips, for all your odd sized ear needs. In practice however, they have a remarkable ability to completely fail to fit in the ear. I couldn’t tell you why, but for the life of me, not a single tip would help them stay in my ear once I let go of them. Something to do with the housing shape meant that no matter which size or orientation I used, the buds continually loosened and fell out. I pushed and rotated them all manner of directions, practically until it hurt and I felt like I was poking my eardrum, but as soon as I released them, they would just relax and start slipping out. This is just sitting still mind you. I had bought these intending to run with them, but I don’t dare because I know it’s a one way trip to losing them in a hedge. Not only is this incredibly frustrating to have them fall out all the time, but the fact they don’t seat correctly means that the sound is almost always at its worst, and you basically are left with a listening experience equivalent to eavesdropping on the content of a bus seatmate. Maybe I’m the oddball with strange lobes, but I’ve never had this kind of issue with other earbuds, it’s always been pop them in and away you go. These just fail to deliver.",3,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
"I wore these for a 45 minute run and the battery died. They were fully charged before the run - or at least they said they were, I left them plugged in overnight to charge. I was very upset because they were super comfortable, I just can’t not have them not last for at least 60 minutes. Very disappointing.",1,1,2019-12-25,1,2,0
These rock my world! Working out at home with these puppies have really eliminated the distraction that causes me to step away from my tv screen when doing workouts at home.  The sound level is sufficient and they have a decent amount of bass.  Th charging convenience in the case makes it easy to keep track of and I like the little magnets that keep them in their box.These also come in handy when watching a late night movie on your phone so you don't disturb anyone.,5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones a few months ago, and since then I have been so impressed with them. The sound quality is great, they fit in my ears so well without them falling out (even through a vigorous kickboxing workout), and the charging process is so easy. The charging port itself takes me under half an hour to fully charge, and it charges the headphones really quickly too. I find that I can work up to 5 hours on a decently high volume before the headphones need to go back in the port for a few minutes. The L and R buds pair with each other super quickly, and they pair really easily with my devices. I use them most often while I'm at work.However, just recently, the L earbud stopped producing sound. Based on the sound prompts that the R earbud would give upon taking the earbuds out of the case, it indicated that it would still properly pair with L, but L just doesn't produce sound. And when I would put L back in the case, R would say that it got disconnected from L. So there isn't a connection issue, it's purely a malfunctioning audio issue.",5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"I got these for my workouts.  I sweat a lot, so I am always on the lookout for waterproof BT headsets.  When my last BT conked out on me, I searched on Amazon for the next one, and came across these.  After reading all the questions and answers and the reviews, I bought them.  They came the next day, and I immediately charged them.  It took me literally 20 seconds from taking them out of the charger, put them in my ears, to pairing them, for me to listen to my first song.  The sound quality is so much better than my last headset for sure.  But what I love most of all is that I can take a shower, and listen to my music without any interruption.  How cool is that?  I have had more expensive headsets in the past, but wasn't as happy as I am now with these.  For only $49.99, these are a steal!",5,1,2019-3-18,1,0,0
"I wanted this type device - 2 separate units versus a connected pair - for a while now but waited until the technology was more stable.  Take these out of the charging base and they connect to each other and then your device really, really quickly.  The sound is crisp and clear.  You use your device to control the volume and song advance as there aren't controls for those on the units...but that's actually a better approach in my opinion as finding tiny buttons while exercising usually is an error filled event.The call clarity is very good and I have not had any drop outs or complaints of muffled speech.  I like these a great deal and think they are an excellent product.",5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I was skeptical when purchasing this item but I love them.  I use them when I go to the dog park.  I plug into outlet to charge them every after about 6 hours of use.  When I have both ears hooked up, I do not hear a lot outside and we are next to a golf course, active hwy & lake.  So at times I do remove one ear bud.  I do notice a “skip” in my audio if I have the case in the same pocket as my phone.  The closer to the battery dying the more “skips” or disruption I hear in the music.  It’s not horrible it cuts out for just a quick second almost like a record skip.  (If you are old enough to know that lol)",4,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0

No dislikes. I have purchased many ear buds before and have never found ones that would stay in my ears. My wife was very skeptical and asked me how many different types I was going to buy. These stay in my ears! They are comfortable. They sound fantastic with a lot of base. They have  a good range for the blue tooth and very easy to set up. I like the charging carrying case. I was excited right away after trying so many others that failed me. I would recommend the TOZO t10. I will be buying these again when I wear them out if that ever happens.,5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"On the positive side, I think the sound quality is excellent.  I really like the holding case for the earbuds, both for its convenience and design as well as that it charges the earbuds and for its wireless charging capability of its own battery.  I use the wireless magnetic charger from my iPhone for this and it works just fine.  The pairing with my iPhone and laptop are both quick and easy.  I had hoped to use them swimming but have not gotten around to that yet, so cannot speak to the waterproof aspect.  Similarly, if I get a phone call, I am still conditioned to use the phone rather than the earbuds, and will just have to ""force"" myself to try out that aspect.As you know, it comes with several sizes of ear caps.  However, in my case, I apparently have pretty tiny ear canals.  So, the smallest size ear cap kinda works but I have to really jam it into my ear (according to their clear instructions for doing so), and watch that they do not still fall out.  For the most part, they do stay in but I still have to be careful.  I will say that the company response has been impressive.  We have emailed back and forth multiple times and they did send, at no charge, what they thought would be smaller ear caps.  The ones they sent were a different color but the same size as the smallest ones that came with the product.  Still, they have followed up and really seem to care.  That counts for a lot right there.  I will hope that at some point, there will be a smaller or thinner ear cap.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"They aren’t bad, but definitely nothing great either. I have been getting frustrated with the fact that while I’m walking, the left bud will cut out constantly. The connectivity between the two is absolutely horrendous. BUT they were also fairly inexpensive as well. If you want something you can use while sitting around or watching YouTube videos, these Are perfect for that. If you want them for working out or heavy activity, you may as well go for something a bit more expensive. Like I said, they aren’t bad, but really not good either. They’re just “okay”",4,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
I did not want to pay the high price for air pods so I decided to try these. I love them! I actually bought a second pair so I can keep one in my car and the other in my house. They come with different ear piece sizes which was great because I needed the smallest. Once you get the sizing right these things stay put. They create a suction so they don’t fall out through the craziest workout. The range on these things is so much better than any other wireless headphones I’ve tried before. The fact that they are waterproof is a huge plus. I wear these in the pool and in the shower. I love the recharging case. I only have to charge it once a week and I use them every day.,5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"Reasons why I returned mine:- Flashing blue light on the side when on - I only noticed these when I was using them at night and saw my room being lit up at about a 5 second interval. Because the two buds are not paired at the same time, the buds flash independent of one another (not at the same time). I prefer something more subtle and would rather not piss off someone I'm sitting next to when on the plane or train.",3,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"I am really surprised about the quality of these earbuds for the price. Qualtiy packaging, manual booklet, something you'd expect from a name brand product. A much better unboxing experience than I expected.The case has a nice heft to it and feels strong, like you could drop it or even throw it at the ground and it'll hold together nicely. I love the magnetic clasp, which also feels strong and I have no worries of it coming open on its own.

"So... we all know that wired headsets are going out of style. I was looking to replace my Bluetooth headset that died on me about a month ago. I had them for two years, and were the kind that drape around your neck with the earpieces connected to the main piece with wires.  It had great battery life and sounded great for $40. I wanted to go truly wireless, but was afraid that it would be too expensive. Lo and behold, these are the top rated on Amazon!

"Although they don't look it, I seem to have very difficult ears to fit.  These work well and stay put, thanks to a variety of included tips.  The sound is also quite nice, although my chief use is with podcasting.  The only slight issues I've had with them is that once in a while, in their case and therefore theoretically off, they'll spring to life and connect to my phone, which then goes silent and creating a puzzle for me to solve; and they might occasionally hiccup the connection, reconnect themselves, and there will be a few seconds' phasing as they sync up again.  Not enough for me to be annoyed with.",4,1,2019-4-2,1,1,0
"Ok so I would have given these earbuds two stars if it weren’t for the insane amount of time they stay charged. I have a job where I’m on my phone most of the day and these lasted a good 6 hours of continuous use. When I wasn’t actively on the phone I was listening to music or a movie while I worked. Sound quality was pretty good . Pairing was a breeze and I never had any connection issues.Now for the cons, which may be two of the biggest reasons why I most likely will return them .  I’ve been on the search for the perfect pair of ear buds for my needs. These came so close !!’ I would sacrifice a not so stellar battery life for these two issues to have not been issues.",3,1,2019-7-10,1,0,0

I was shocked they actually staid in my ear with no issue. Its also slim enough charging case .  Also the using it to make calls was really nice, actually was better than my sony cans.Now my only ""issue"" which i think would be a great idea to add for the future is a button on the case that shows its current battery level instead of needing to take out one of the buds and putting it back in. Oh and also the cover for the micro usb to charge is a pain to open its in there good.....which is for the water resistance but still.  People were talking about issues with it cutting out, I only experienced it one time but after that its hasn't happened since .",5,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0

I tried changing the settings on my phone to mono instead of stereo but that didn't help. Then the left ear bud refused to sync. I have returned these and bought MPOW M30 instead.Old review: Just received my TOZO T10 wireless earbuds. Love them already. Noise cancelling is excellent (had to stop the music to hear my husband talking to me ha ha). The packaging says music playtime is about 3 hours, and phone call is about 5 hours.

I use a single ear bud often for phone/work calls and during this CV19 work from home time, I can work from my pool! (Don't tell the boss). They provide a number of ear inserts that I recommend trying out to find the best fit. I had to downsize one to get the most comfortable fit. I highly recommend these ear buds if you are looking for quality and a great design.",5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"Right out of the box the Tozo T10 worked effortlessly. I pulled them out of the case and they were ready to pair with my phone.  After pairing them with my phone for the first time they immediately connect each time I remove them from the case and they are ready to go.  The sound quality and volume is outstanding.  The depth of the base is very good.  Noise canceling is nearly perfect.  You will feel isolated even in the loudest environments.  I showed these to my daughter who had recently purchased the latest EarPod at $140.  The look of dismay on her face when she sampled music on the T10 was priceless.  Look for her EarPods on Ebay.  I don't know about battery life as I haven't worn them longer than a couple of hours at a time....they haven't failed me yet.  The range is a respectable 30 feet or so.The only Con I can mention is fit.  Sometimes they fall out if I strain, chew, or cough.  This is a problem may be unique to me though.

"I've experienced more than 10 earbud products so far and noted that understood pros/cons as well as expectations of such product. OK, the first thing first and let's begin with the perspective. It has brought a Super great sounds quality and rich level of base. If you think that you'd look for the quality sounds, you won't be regret at all.However, one of the biggest concern here is connectivity that is constantly missing signal between LH/RH device, with interval of every 8 to 10 minute (without supplying media). Under the circumstance, devices are dropping entire connection with phone/tablet and have to reconnect in order to make proper sync between media source and earbuds. Dropping signal and repicking up happens also when the media is supplying to the device, of which occurs about every 30 to 40 minute.",1,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

So, needless to say I began my search for other earbuds and found these. I trusted the other reviews and purchased them and not only did they arrive the SAME DAY I ordered them, but they are amazing!! I struggled at first putting them in and having them sit comfortably but then saw a note that said there were extra ear plug sizes. I found the right one for me and honestly have enjoyed the loud, noise cancelling sound of these headphones. They remind me of beats with the great quality sound they provide.

They are easy to pair with anything on the fly and the sound quality is great. As a reporter having these has made my job a lot easier, especially because I don't have to cradle a phone or handset anymore.My only complaint would be I wish the charger battery lasted a bit longer. If you take one of the headphones out and immediately return it to the case it'll start charging again which ultimately drains the overall battery.

I don’t have that problem with these! In fact after a week of my son using the more expensive ones I bought at the store we returned them and got a second pair of these! I honestly thought that at this price it was too good to be true but these earbuds are amazing! The sound quality is great, they really do block out other noise and they are comfort. The battery life seems to be great as well. I have never had them doe on me so that is a plus! I would recommend these to anyone looking for great quality wireless earbuds.",5,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0
"For $40, these have been a solid investment for me.Pros:  Price, fit great with many options.  Apple airpods don’t stay in my ears, these do.",4,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
I am quite dissapointed as I was looking for something comparable to airpods but not $250. I initially liked these I use them as a headset for work a lot and also to listen to music at the gym. When I have them in for extended periods of time they will just do this wacky beeping and disconnect and reconnect. No clue why. I often talk to people who say they can't hear me so I have to switch to another headset which is a huge pain and when I leave voicemails people call me back and say they couldn't hear a thing I said. I am going to reach out to support and see what they say because they are really not working for me.,1,1,2019-9-9,1,2,0
"These are my go to wireless headphones now, the sound quality is great for the price and the charging case is easy to throw in my bag. It charges up in the case about two and a half times before you need to plug it in, and the earbuds themselves last about 2-3 hours fully charged. It's not as long as I would like, but they're so small I really can't complain. They do fall out of your ears if you whip your head around (and I tried all the sizes of the rubber earpiece and found one that fits my ear) so it's ok if you're just lifting weights at the gym, but not great for dancing or any more full body workouts. I'm not a runner, but I would be afraid to run with these as I'd feel like they were constantly about to fall out. I have walked with them in and had no problem though, they just have to be occasionally adjusted.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"So much for that over 4 hour playtime. Let me clarify though. It was 3 hours until an obnoxious ""LOW BATTERY PLEASE CHARGE"" warning played every 15 seconds. My iPhone was telling me that the earbuds still had at least 40% charge left though. That is such an oversight. One warning is enough. And again, according to my iPhone I was no where near ""low battery"".Sound quality is okay. I feel I've had better sound quality from cheap $10 wired earbuds though so I dunno if the convenience of wireless is worth the trade off there.",2,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"I am not going to lie I was kinda skeptical at first.  I was a wired headphone user, still am just not a much anymore.  The first thing that came to my mind is the sound quality.  The little things pack a punch.  It blew my mind for a second.  I was like no way these better than AKG wired headphone.  This must be a placebo effect.  Compare both I was ok ok this is real.  The bass caught me off guard because I love good bass in my songs.",5,1,2020-1-25,1,1,0
"I expected so much more from these considering they were one of the highest rated on amazon and had a great review rating. When I first got them, they were easy to connect but the sound was just not up to par with what people were saying about this product..the bass was not good and kind of had a faint static always running in the background...the connection was better than other brands that I had tried but would still break up from time to time. Another thing, about the waterproofing. Yes, they are waterproof. Too bad that they don't stay in your ear. I don't think I have irregular ear canals and I even adjusted to a different size that came with the product but no such luck. They were constantly falling out and had to be adjusted to stay in my ear and even then, your ear would start hurting or you'd just get annoyed at the process. Last thing, really disappointed these don't have mono mode that switches between the buds. Only the right one can be used alone while the left one charges but not vice versa.Overall, I really hoped these would be the ones. but pretty disappointed at the lack of features and sound quality",2,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"These headphones are GREAT for the price! The only reason I didn’t give five stars is because they fall out of my ears really easily. However, they are also really compact, and therefore easier to put in and carry around. It’s a trade-off, I suppose. The quality is really excellent for what you pay, which is the main selling point in my opinion. One of them actually fell out of my ear and into the toilet while I was cleaning. (I don’t advise doing things like that with them in - I was still new to them at this point) I got it out, disinfected it, and dried it off, and it still worked, good as new. I really enjoy being able to pull them out of the case and have them immediately connect to my phone for use. Another cool feature that I didn’t expect is that it’s really easy to make calls while using them. Sometimes when I am using other Bluetooth headphones, my friends complain of muffled sound or other complications. I have never had this problem with these. I can set my phone down and make a call with these without them interfering in any way, whether with their size or the connection. The range of these earphones is also incredible. I can leave my phone in one room and move anywhere in my house without them disconnecting or losing sound quality. Would definitely buy again for a friend.",4,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
The first pair stopped pairing after 1 1/2 months.  Only the right one worked and they wouldn't reset despite multiple tries.  TOZO did replace them.  They didn't offer a refund.  I've only had the 2nd pair for a few days.  So far they are working but so did the first pair at first.We've had two other types of wireless earbuds in the $30-$40 range that I gave as gifts to my kids.  1/2 of those stopped pairing after a few weeks as well.  My recommendation is that If you can afford them I'd spend the extra money on better earbuds.  I don't hear any similar problems with Apple or similar priced units from my friends.,3,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0
"I have been using this item with my girlfriend about a month and have thoroughly enjoyed the product. The battery lasts very long, and the case does a great job of charging the headphones when your not using them. In my experience the battery tends to perform about 10% better than advertised, but your mileage may vary.  The headphones were advertised as water resistant and I don't suggest this, but I can confirm their durability. About a week or two after owning I was in the restroom, forgot that the right headphone was still in my ear and it fell out into my toilet (fortunately just clean water). I was stunned and then quickly reached into the water and removed the headphone. I dried it with a paper towel and took a q-tip and attempted to dry the inside of the headphone as well. I left the headphone off to dry overnight (approx. 24 hours), and then placed the headphone back on the charger. After charging I connected it to my phone and it worked perfectly fine. I only mention all of that so that people don't think that this is waterproof or that you can just start using immediately. I'm too cheap/nervous to test that out. I don't really know how to compare to other wireless sets as I don't have others. If I walk away from my phone with the right bud still in my ear, and the left bud in my gf's ear, the headphones will disconnect with distance of course. When I return in range, the right bud will automatically reconnect, but the left will not. We have to take both buds out, return to the charge case for a few seconds, then remove from the charge case and they reconnect to the phone again normally. I wouldn't say it's a negative, and it may just be the limitations of bluetooth technology at this time.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"My job requires a lot of noisy machine work, such as mowers, tractors, etc. I have never had a problem hearing perfectly clear no matter the outside noise. Having headphones that fit my ears has always been a struggle, until these! I use them for hours, so I can’t expect the battery to last forever, but I do wish they lasted longer I had to remember to charge them every night (but no different than a phone). But being able to charge them in the case is a perfect feature. I’ve used them almost daily for well over a year. When the case stopped charging I reached out to their customer service and they had excellent response rate and care. I highly recommend these ear buds, not only for the product but the company.",5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"I really like the sound from these earbuds. They're clear with a decent amount of bass. My only complaint is that you can only pause/play music and answer/hang up calls from the earbud itself. My other one I can skip tracks by double pressing the right one and go back by double pressing the left. Other than that they're great for the price. I really like that they have wireless charging...that feature is cool but doesn't really help me when I'm listening to music and want to change the track. I got wireless earbuds for a reason...and unless I'm wearing my watch, I have to get my phone and change tracks..I guess it's a minor inconvenience but an inconvenience nonetheless.",4,1,2019-9-26,1,0,0
"I love love love these earbuds. I looked long and hard and read more reviews about earbuds than I care to admit. I was finally sold when I read a review of these that were right up my technical-alley. I'm a sound snob, unfortunately and these produce all that I could hope for short of being in a concert standing next to the speakers! I have two pair so while one charges I can listen to the other. They both pair without any problems to my Samsung Galaxy S7 and are easy to wear. They never hurt my ears. I'm only sad I can't wear them more often (working meetings really get in the way of my musical enjoyment of these earbuds! :-)  ). I would venture to say that these are even better audio quality than the Bose earbuds I bought a couple of years ago, especially given the price! Go TOZO!",5,1,2019-6-27,1,0,0
"These are great earbuds.  I am still experimenting to see which ear caps are best for me to keep the earbuds in.  There are no directions for changing the ear caps.  I could take the ear caps off easily, but I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to get them on the earbuds.  The video and instructions do not explain this at all, and writing customer service did not provide any new instructions, and they did not even answer my second email.  Here is what I figured out that worked for me: Do not try to put the ear caps on directly, straight.  Tilt them and get one side of the orange circle to collapse, this allows them to start slipping on.  Still not easy to change ear caps, but it is possible.",4,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"Just received these today. They were fully charged after only half an hour or so in the case and the case was fully charged in the same span. The sound quality is great for 35$ earbuds. They're comfortable and they come with the case, a charger for the case, a ribbon to tie the case onto, the earbuds, and 3 sets of replacement ear covers (which I thought was awesome). All that for 35$, and the audio isn't garbage? And they're waterproof? Idk, couldn't really be more pleased with these so far- though I did just purchase them so who knows, that could change. Will update this in a while but for now I can say I would definitely recommend, especially if you fall asleep to music/audio and want something that will block some noise but feels comfortable in your ear. I am also fairly confident that they will not fall out in my bed overnight. Definitely worth the money. Bluetooth pairing was a breeze as well, I recommend removing one ear bud before the other.",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"The ear buds seemed fine, call quality was reportedly not good, but I could hear callers well. I didn't get them for anything but music so that was ok. However, the right earbud completely stopped working 40 days after I received the item. The left earbud is fine, will charge up in either the right or left port of the charge, but the right won't do anything. So the product is now useless and it's too late to return.**update**",3,1,2020-7-11,1,1,0
Right out the box sounded good and worked. Today first day using them in the gym and the connection kept going in and out. Eventually the left ear piece just went out completely. And yes they were fully charged to any captain obvious out there. Came home charged again (just in case) and the left ear piece continues not to work consistently. Also not as loud as I hoped. Not sure why these have such a high rating.,1,1,2020-1-22,1,1,0
"I bought the white version of this product and i've been using it for about a month now and this is just an all around great  product. The white design is very sleek and I've gotten a few compliments about it. There are a lot of pros (+) to this product and some cons (-), which really dont affect the product quality too much.(+) Great sound Quality and volume. I play these at maybe 1/3 of the volume i used on my old bluetooth headphones. The quality itself is very crisp, clear, and all over balanced.",5,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
"The sound on these is excellent. They pair quickly with my iPod. I bought a second pair for my daughter who uses them to block out noise while studying. I had an issue with the charger after several months. I emailed the excellent customer service and received a brand pair in the mail within days, even though I only needed the charger. I highly recommend these!I've lowered this review to three stars. The earbuds have lasted and the sound quality continues to be great but the touch control feature is far too sensitive for my fingers. If I reach up to adjust them and I'm listening to a book on tape, they can easily reset my book to the beginning. I find this feature very annoying and a game changer. I won't use them for books etc.",3,1,2019-8-27,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones before I went on a trip to Aruba.  It was my first pair that didn't have a cord.  I was skeptical at first but they were VERY comfortable.  So comfortable in fact, that when a strong gust of wind blew-it flew out of my ear.  I didnt realize at first (since they feel like nothing) but when I did realize it was too late and they had gotten run over by a car.I was sad- I didn't want to pay $50 for a new pair so I went with a cheaper pair from a different brand.  Let me tell you-saving $15 was NOT worth it.",5,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0
"I don't have a ton of experiance with wireless earbuds, but I've had a ton of wired pairs. I ordered 2 sets of these and when they arrived I was blown away. The bass is extremely promenate and better than pretty much every set of earphones I've ever had. I love bass and if earphones don't have decent bass then I'm not really impressed. The treble sounds great also, and the overall sound experience is very pleasing.There is a strange crackling sound when putting them in my ears from the small thin layer of plastic on the speakers. This is due to they way they are manufactured and this is common for earphones that are water resistant. I just hope it doesn't dammage the buds. Tozo does offer a good warantee though, so this shouldn't be an issue.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"I like this product for the price. I am now wondering after using it for months weather I should have just bought apple earpods instead. The fact that it does not always connect to my device derives me insane. Sometimes it just connect with one ear, sometimes it's the other ear. I have to literally spent 20 minutes or longer to get it to connect properly. I have to reset it 5 times for it to finally work. When it is connected it works great. Noise cancellation is great, stays in my ear ( I am a petite woman), I work out with it, and the volume and sounds is great. JUST sucks to get it to connect consistently. sighhhhhh",2,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"Everything seems good except the battery life doesn't seem to be as long as advertised and they don't stay in my ears. I've tried every size bud. Apparently I've missed the return window by two days.Edit-The seller contacted me, and after a couple days we worked out a refund to the method I used to purchase. I am satisfied with the seller. I have only used the buds a couple times. After rechecking most aspects seemed to be as described. I did not test the waterproof aspect or the audio quality technical aspects. Sweat from exercising did not damage them from what I could tell. The audio quality is great, but I did not test any technical details. My main problem with them is that no matter which size bud I used they would not stay in my ears, especially while exercising. That being the case, I likely will not use them much. I seem to have the same issue with most earbuds of this style. If you usually don't have problems with buds falling out, then these will probably do well for you. If not, the seller seemed determined to make sure I was satisfied with them. As stated they did contact me after seeing my initial review and refunded my money to my same purchase method after a few emails.",4,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"The earphones and charging case feel well made. They seal in the ear canal which blocks outside sound and keeps them in place. I use them for workouts and they fell out with the default earpiece but a smaller size held in place well. There are four sizes included so they should fit most people.The sound is clear and the bass is strong, if a little boomy. For the price I think these would be hard to beat.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"These were nice when I received them and did what they claim. However, my left earbud suddenly stopped taking a charge. It died early in my run and I can't get the LED to come on indicating charging. The other issue I have had has been more so with the fit of the fit of the buds in my ears. No matter which caps I put on the buds work their way out of my ears during a run. However, I suspect the second issue could be as much about my ears as the earbuds. The sound quality wasn't bad, but definitely could be better. They are a bit tinny, with little low-end response, but again, this seems connected to how well they seat in my ears. If I can fully seat the silicone i get much better bass response. But even if they are in well, they quickly work back out. But none of this matters if only one earbud dies.",2,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"Initial Thoughts:The earphones have a very nice look and are light weight. The battery life is great and the sound is pretty good. As for the noise cancelling, these wireless earphones are perfect.

"I am extremely pleased with the quality of these earbuds. Easy to understand indicator lights, the buds themselves charge very fast and the base holds a good amount of charge and also charges quickly on a wireless charger.  And excellent sound quality. Also work well as bluetooth headset for phone calls.  The lid and buds are held in place by perfectly strong magnets.  Only complaint is that sometimes they fall out of my ears, but that's probably more on me than the earbuds.

"Great headphones that arrived fast. My other headphones are Jaybird bluetooth and a Sony WH-1000XM3. These headphones are ideal for the gym and running. With the multiple sizes of attachments, it should fit snugly for nearly all ear types. The sound is good and has some decent bass. Overall the sound and fit are better than my Jaybirds which I would use for gym/running. As a bonus they are water/sweatproof. They are lightweight which is great. The case is small and the wireless charging is great. It easily fits into my pocket. Obviously the sound cannot compare to my Sony headphones but thats not why I bought them.If youre looking for a pair of good sounding wireless in ear headphones that fit snugly that also feature wireless charging, look no further.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"I have been looking for a waterproof set of ear buds to use for lap swimming for a long time that lived up to their promise .... I found these to be very frustrating when in the water. I paired them to my phone as the Apple watch screen locks in lap swimming mode when in water and I would loose connection thinking this would fix the loss of sound and music but it didn’t. Unless my ears were out of the water completely the buds didn’t work at all they would loose connection. Several times they would stop completely needing to be repaired to my phone which I had to keep at the end of my lane. Another issue was that my swim cap and water would somehow cause the input of volume or skipping forward or backwards functions to randomly occur, this was very frustrating. In the end I removed them to finish my laps in comfort and peace.Outside the water I found them to be Very high quality product, great sound, easily paired to my Apple Watch 5 and I phone 8 plus.

The mic still didn’t work with my iPhone so I gave them to my boyfriend who has an android. For some reason the mic works for him and he’s had no issue.

"I was looking at a few more expensive models of earbuds and saw these on Amazon. I decided to try these given the reviews, water resistance and price. I have not been disappointed. These buds have great sound quality and stay in my ear very well. I have been very active with them and so far they have not fallen out. It is important to pick the right size ear piece for a proper fit (different sizes are included). Pairing is seamless on my iPhone no problems. I have had a few very minor breaks in sound when streaming Pandora, not sure if it’s the buds or the stream but not a huge issue at all. Phone calls are clear and have had no feedback saying that I cannot be heard. Overall for the price point these are great earbuds!Update (10/11/19): The left earbud has stopped working and I contacted Tozo Support for warranty help.

The sounds begins to cut out when they are more than approximately 2 feet from your phone, which incidentally is just under the distance from your ear to your pocket (if you're short).

These things can be very subjective, but I simply love the balance on these. Just the right amount of base, midrange and highs for my taste, with no perceptible distortion. It's like they were equalized especially for me.

The earphones will not stay charged and you will have to re-charge them 'prior' to every use, which is a HUGE inconvenience!",1,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
As a music lover. I need bass!!! And these fulfill my needs. Battery life is great and the music quality is great. I'd definitely recommend these headphones. The smallest ear buds fit me perfectly. I'm still trying to figure out how to adjust them so my braids don't knock the ear piece out of my ear. But the noise cancelation on these are life!!!!! I don't have to turn my volume all the way up on flights. Comes with a year warranty also,5,1,2019-1-7,1,2,0
UPDATE: The left earbud is no longer able to charge for some reason and so now its useless.. The problem seems to be the earbud inself and not the charging case because the right earbud charges in both of the charging pods. I dont put these through any extravagant abuse. I only use at home and just a few hours each day. I dont even take it on the go. Very sad to see my $40 wasted.I've had this for about a month now. Bought this one because it had the most high reviews. I honestly don't know why. The sound quality is muddy with bass although I havent burned in the speakers yet. Its not bad for youtube videos but if im listening to some bass heavy music it just becomes unbalanced with too much bass and not enough treble. That may change in the future as I continue to use it and burn them in. I think the batteries are ok. Distance connectivity is great. I can leave my phone in the bedroom and go to the other end of my apartment and in some cases even outside and still be connected. The major flaw (at least with mine) is that the left ear will disconnect or lose signal from the right (main) ear just by simply laying my head on the left side or if one of the sides are simply covered my my hand. But only the left one will lose signal or cut in and out so many times. Even if I switch them around the left earbud will still be the one to lose signal. Very annoying when im trying to listen to music or watch something while laying on my side. They are bigger than regular ear buds so it takes some getting used to. They arent uncomfortable. But they are sometimes difficult to keep in your ears. You have to constantly wipe them off because after a while in your ears they become waxy and start to slip out. They are easy to wear once you first wipe everything off though. Had i known they would not have been as good as the reviews I would've bought the other ones i had in my wish list for a few bucks less or just regular wired earbuds again.,5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"I got a pair of these for my wife few months ago because she needed a set of wireless earbuds for her podcasts. As I was setting them up for her, I tested them out with some music and was very pleasantly surprised by the sound quality. Bass was deep and with the proper seal with the supplied ear tips, ambient noise is blocked out. There has been no issue with connectivity, and the wireless charging case is extremely convenient. I wound up getting another pair for myself just a few days ago because my $120 Jaybird set dies on me. For a fraction of the price, they sound just as good to me. I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for a quality product at this price range.",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"First, these are not airpods. The airpods are balanced, the center of gravity is low and rests on the ear. The center of gravity of these are above the center of your eardrums, so sometimes it feels like they want to fall out - but they don't really fall out.That out of the way - for an under $50 set of earphones, these are fantastic. They work well. The re-charging case is brilliant (can charge the earphones 4 or 5 times between case recharges) and I love wireless charging for the case, so we don't have to keep track of a non-lightning cable. The sound quality is good, not crazy good, but solidly good. I liked them enough that I bought another pair (in another color) for my wife.",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"I liked these earbuds so much after a friend showed me her's that I went out immediately and purchased my own. After using them on a regular basis my husband wanted some for himself so we purchased a set for him.  Some time later I started experiencing difficulties with the charging box retaining a charge. I would charge it to full (all blue lights) and within a couple of hours there were no blue lights available to recharge the earbuds.  I contacted customer service and explained.  They gave me some tips on charging to help, which did after first. Then a couple of weeks later it wouldn't work any longer.  Keep in mind my husband's set has not had the same experience.  I contacted customer service and let them know that I tried their suggested with no success.  Believe it or not, I was offered a complete replacement.  I have never had that experience.  I usually have to do more troubleshooting, then return them to obtain some credit or replacement and wait to see what would happen (like when my cell phone provider). Not the case.  They issued me replacements and I don't have to return the ones I have.  What a great way to support the customer.  I wasn't accused of anything. I treated with dignity and understanding.  What a great approach to a product that I believe is worthy.  I might have just gotten a set that had a glitch not that I caused.  Thank you so much.  I recommend this product! Despite the issue that the charging box must remain plugged in at all times to charge my earbud, they still sound amazing.",4,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"These are the FIRST earbuds of this kind that I've used where i haven't had ANY dissconnect or glitchy issues. So far anyway. These have pretty good sound quality, pretty good bass. The only downside to the sound is that these earbuds don't like symbols on drums. They come across as staticy on most songs that have high hats and symbols.These don't have the best sound quality but considering these are the first rechargeable case wireless earbuds I've bought without connectivity issues i love them. They have more bass than the $160 jabres. They sound amazing with audio books. One kind of annoying thing is that if you don't turn them off before putting them in the case they will constantly discharge, killing the case battery",4,1,2019-5-19,1,0,0
"I'm kinda torn on how I feel about these. I was blown away at first but as I listend to more songs I noticed some would have almost like a ""rattle"" sound. Some songs sound great though. But with some, no matter what volume or amount of bass (or lack of) there is a slight static/rattle. I tried resetting them twice (it says to do so if theres any static sound) but it didn't fix it. I plugged in my old Apple headphones to see if maybe it was just me, but while listening to the same songs there was no rattle/static. So just a little bummed about that.",3,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"I am glad I paid 50 bucks for these babies and did not go with the cheaper ones. These are as good as $100 buds for half the price. Work great and come with ALL WIRELESS charging (charger and earbuds) and great battery life. Charger CAN charge the earphones so it is a huge bonus on the go. Also, earbuds have a long battery life, pairing instantly with the phone, have good range and connection. Great sound too. Seller even offers a free bonus with the purchase. So I am very satisfied.

"I just charged these for maybe an hour, and paired them to my phone. I love them SO MUCH already. The sound is incredible, they stay in my ears (I shook my head a bunch just to test this lol) and pairing was super easy. They come with several sizes of ear buds, and when placed just right, they are truly sealed nicely in your ears. I just started using them so I can't speak to the battery life, but I'll update when I have a better idea.BONUS: Months ago, I bought the ""Just Wireless 2pk 5W Qi Wireless Charging Pads"" from Target for my iphone, but they also charge the case for these earbuds!!!!! I can only speak to the charging pads I got from Target, but it's possible that another wireless charging pad may work as well.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"These are good for phone calls and pretty good for music. They mostly stay in my ears, but I wish the had the fin option because when they do fall out, it’s a nightmare. Also, when I’m walking, my music cuts out at least once per song. That never happened with my soundpeat qy7 headphones. I Like the charging case. It’s great how many charges I get out of it. Downside: The cord that came with it appears to be broken. At first, I thought it just wouldn't charge in my car, but then it won't charge when plugged in to my computer either. Will have to see if I can get a replacement. In any case, I bought these and a pair of wireless soundpeats and I thought these were way better, even though I was initially looking for a replacement for Soundpeats that I lost and thought I'd like the Soundpeats better.",4,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
I love that I can use these in the pool. I am a water aerobics instructor and need to listen to my music in the pool as I practice my routine before I can present on deck at the pool. I cannot disturb everyone with my music so I searched for an affordable solution. This are perfect! I have very small ear canals and they have different size buds ends so I have the choice to downsize for a better fit. A bonus - the built in microphone for phone calls. I did not really need this feature but used them to just try them out on dry land to see how they fit and received a phone call. The mic was great even walking outside. I highly recommend these.,5,1,2019-11-13,1,0,0
"Great sound quality, battery life, and ease of use. The charger case is helpful as I can just charge whenever I'm not using the headphones. The only downside is range is very weak. I wish there was more range, ESPECIALLY through walls. In fact, if you hold one of the headphones in a closed fist it won't have any more signal.Changed my review to two stars because , after a month or so, the charger case stopped charging on the right side. So now I can only charge one headphone at a time. The case was never dropped or otherwise damaged, it just happened on its own. Get what you pay for, I suppose.",2,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0
"These headphones are ok for walking, and extremely frustrating to use while running. I originally had these synced to my phone which I carried in my hand while running. If my rhythm altered at all while running it would interrupt the audio connection and either skip or disconnect entirely. I recently purchased a Fitbit Ionic, and the earbuds did the same exact thing when paired with that device too. Although the idea of having wireless headphones was appealing, the connection is unstable regardless of which device I use. I have to stiffen my arm to prevent skipping / drops from music. I tested the connection by flexing my wrists up / down and waving my arm around with both my phone and Ionic, and the motions confirmed that is what was interrupting my wireless connection. I removed the device from my settings on both my phone and Ionic, then reinstalled it, but still had the same issues. The phone and earbuds were also fully charged. The really disappointing thing is I bought 2 pairs of these, and my husband's does the exact same thing when using the bluetooth feature.The case is extremely convenient and pretty heavy-duty. The water resistance is also a nice perk. Another thing I like about these headphones is the case automatically charges the headphones when you put them back, plus there are magnets that hold the earbuds within the case. You can also visually see the charge progress and how much charge is left within the case even when it's closed because of the LED indicators.",3,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0

Ok let me say first these really surprised me. I am a 13 year old with very small ears and yet the ear buds fit perfectly! They are light weight and stay in your ears nicely if you are looking for some good wireless ear buds I would HIGHLY recommend these. You can snow board with them do swim yoga with them (if that is a thing) you can bike with them and much more! They are VERY waterproof. I have dropped them in the bath tub and they were just fine. The sound quality is amazing and nice and loud. They do also cancel sound well like I can mow the lawn use a chop saw Table saw pretty much any saw you can imagine! The case is awesome too! You can charge it wirelessly or use the cord provided! If I were you I would definitely get these!,5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"The charging case is larger but that’s not FL definitely  not a deal breaker, it means I won’t lose the case at all unlike the airpod case. This T10 case is very sturdy and strong. Bought a red silicone case to cover it (red is my favorite color).. The earbuds fit snug in my ear, doesn’t hurt, just comfortable. I made my first call using this tonight and the sound quality was SUPERB! For once, the person on other end didn’t complain of hearing more noise from elsewhere than my voice. I was heard clearly which means no extra noise in the background. I’m not sure on the battery life but I will give it 5 stars and if the battery life is not up to par after some time,  I will adjust the stars. But based on the products from this company, I’m sure my stars won’t be going anywhere.The SOUND quality for music is AMAZING!

I have had 3 other headsets and each one had horrible sound quality and when I tried to speak to my sister, she said I sounded like I was in a can or underwater.

But they do charge very fast and they are super convenient for a quick charge.",2,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
I am pleasantly surprised with these earbuds...the reviews are no myth. I like that there are multiple sizes so you can find the right fit for you. They are also great at cancelling background noise....I’m currently renting an apartment and my landlords dog barks constantly (I’ve been going insane) but once I popped these in and watched a movie I couldn’t hear the dog anymore. The case is small and sturdy and for the price you really can’t beat these.My biggest surprise when it came to these earbuds is the sound quality...it has a surprising amount of bass which is something important to me....I want good sound quality above all else and these have it for an affordable cost.

"For an inexpensive set, I was impressed. Battery life was what I expected. Was impressed by how well they'd stay connected when distance from the device was increased. I could get a solid 50 ft before they'd disconnect, but as soon as I was back in that window, they'd connect again unless there were several walls that had to be transmitted through. But the right one just died. The right one is the ""base"" unit. I can still use the left, but you only get half the stereo at that point. Im on the fence about buying another set. I got 8 months out of them.",3,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0

I like that these came with several different options for sizing in the ear.  I was able to find one that didn't ever seem to make my ear sore.  I don't believe I have ever had that before.  I haven't used earbuds a really long time because they just never worked out for me.  I wore these for several hours when I got them prior to doing any charge or anything and was extremely satisfied with sound quality and comfort.  I haven't done much other then working around the house so I can update once I take them to the gym or some other environment.  I don't foresee any issues though.  Great product.UPDATE:  I have tried all of the different sized ear pieces.  When jogging they tend to slip out.  I'm constantly adjusting them to keep them in.  Walking is fine but jogging/running is when I always have to push them back in...  It probably has more to do with my ears then anything.  Just thought I would update.,5,1,2019-6-26,1,0,0

"These are so cool!!! I started work in a factory and can listen to music but my headphone cord was constantly getting hooked on knobs. A girl was there with Apple Airpods and I was entranced. I had never seen wireless headphones in real life so I didn't realize how cool they were. I can't afford Apple products brand new, but I wanted brand new, and my stepdad sent me a screenshot of these on Amazon. The reviews confirmed my purchase. They are not as small as I thought they would be like Apple Airpods but I don't care, for $40 they are an amazing investment and was so easy to set up, the only problem I had was putting the smallest size rubber part onto the headphone lol. The rest of the set up I didn't even look at instructions, if you are technologically savvy, you will get it. Make sure your bluetooth option is turned on on your phone, the headphones will pop up, confirm (should be the right one, not the left), voila you are ready to go.",5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0

I've also used them for phone calls and I found that just using the right bud was better for me when on a call. The build quality seems very good considering the low cost of this product. As others have stated, they supply you with a few different sized ear pieces just in case the one already attached doesn't fit your ear canal. Fortunately for me the ones attached fit perfectly. I had them in while working out at the gym and they never felt loose and I didn't worry they'd fall out. I am pleased so far with this product and I am hoping they last a few years!

The sound quality when listening to music is great however when I am on a call, the other person/people on the line hear me as if I am far away, and I cut in/out. I believe the issue is whenever there is background noise (fan blowing/AC blowing in the car) it interferes and causes issues. I tried pairing them to another phone but the problem persisted. Then I thought maybe they were defective so I exchanged them for another pair. Nope, still the same problem.

As much money as I've spent over the years replacing wired headphones, I probably could've bought 4 or 5 pair of these, if not more.I wanted a nice pair of earbuds but I wasn't willing to spend the money it costs for Beatz or Bose.

"I want to note first off that this is my first set of true wireless earbuds. I've always stuck with headphones or the wireless earbud style connected by wire. I was rather disappointed with the overall sound quality of these earbuds. I will say that the bass response is very good with these, that's why I was able to give it two stars instead of one. For simple music or listening to podcasts/audiobooks these do fine. Unfortunately, when listening to songs with a lot of percussion there is a prominent static noise (Yes, I've tried resetting as the manual says multiple times with no luck).It is most notable when listening to some instrumental music or metal, which is what I listen to when I workout and usually when I would be using these headphones.  I find this confusing because when listening to this type of music it sounds like a pair of cheap/free headphones would, but the other ranges like the bass and mids sound great. I also only saw about 3.5 hours of constant use on mid-volume with a full recharge time of 1.5-2 hours.Bottom Line: Sound quality in some ranges is very tinny and poor, making the overall listening experience for my desired use unacceptable. Battery performance is also poor for my needs. I would suggest going with a more expensive pair of true wireless earbuds, or sticking with the sport style wireless earbuds that are connected together instead of these.",2,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
To be honest not The best. You have to be right on top of your phone to stay connected. Even when you are one earbud will cut out randomly. The battery life sucks compared to my last set. I get about 4 hours of use before it dies. And the charging box has to be continually plugged in to recharge them. I'd only get these for like a younger kid  or someone who doesn't really use them that often otherwise not worth it.Update! The company has gone above and beyond to make this right. They resent me a pair and they are working so much better! The distance i can be from my phone is much better as well and the battery life. To be honest they are better than the pair I got for Christmas which were double the price.

"Despite the fact that I have several wired ""wireless"" bluetooth headphones for my devices, I have friends who use Airpods with their iPhones, and it looked rather convenient to have such a small device ready at the moment's notice while out and about. So I decided to shop around and see what I could find. This is my first foray into a device of this style, you know - completely wireless, but so far I am very pleased with them.My first concern was size. Airpods have that little stick portion that hangs out of the ear, and there are several Android styles similar to that, but I have a few pairs of Skullcandy earbuds that use this model's offset ear canal design, and I find them far more comfortable than older, straight line earbud designs. The TOZO earbud is a good size, and the weight is very comfortable in the ear. It is not difficult, even with how small they are, to pick them out of the case, or to fit them into the ear when needed. The directions included make it easy to understand how to use them, but if you fit the right size cups, and then insert and twist like you are told, you will have a tough time shaking the buds loose. That said, I still bought the Amazon 3 Yr Warranty, it's $5, just in case something happens, better than shelling out another $40.",5,1,2019-6-27,1,0,0

In the house, in the office, and while running in remote areas like a forest preserve, they sound fine. But if I wear them while running down a busy street the connection cuts out repeatedly and the music becomes literally unlistenable.",4,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0
"I bought these for my husband as he listens to podcasts. The battery life is amazing, and I cannot hear anything when he is listening to podcasts right next me. They are small, which is good and be aware when they fall out. We did have one of them stop working after 4 months. Since it was past the Amazon return window, I reached out to the company directly and they sent us a brand new replacement set for no charge. The new ones work great! My husband loves them. Tozo provides 100% top customer service!!! I would highly recommend buying not only these earbuds but also from TOZO.UPDATE: We have enjoyed these earbuds so much we have purchased a new pair. They are really awesome, and our kids even enjoy them. I highly recommend TOZO for their products as well as amazing customer service.",5,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
"Everything else was nice, but no volume control on the ear piece! I wanted to connect it to the t.v. to watch at night, but you cannot control the volume from the t.v. remote. It is only one volume, which to me is loud. I even muted the t.v. and still it's on high. I like the push button because the controls won't change if your clothes brush against it or if you are lying down on a cushion. I also liked that I could pair either just the right or the left separately If I just wanted to use one ear bud. If you listen to music on your phone then you can control the volume only from the phone. Guess it doesn't work when connecting to a t.v.",3,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"For the price, these buds are great!  Sound is good and it comes with the charging case and cord.  In addition, it has several different sizes for ears.  The one thing that I'm still trying to figure out is the touch to get the sound to go up or down.  As it is right now, I'm using my phone to adjust the sound.  It's hard for me to tap the bud(s) to get what I need out of it.  Only time and practice I guess.  Otherwise, I'm glad I purchased these for the price.  I bought the tan (bronze) -- I don't like white sticking out so  much!",4,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0
"I attempted to wear these to run. I tried several sizes of tips and they just would NOT stay in my ears. Maybe my ears are abnormal? This is not beyond possibility. I don’t have a super-great track record with finding earbuds that work for me. The second my sweat got goin’ they started slipping out. The sound quality was fine. They didn’t always both connect to my phone which I thought was odd.UPDATE: after seeing my review, the company reached out to me and offered to replace my purchase with a different product at no charge, it showed up two days later and it totally works for me! Mad props for this company! You can buy their products with confidence knowing that if something isn’t right, they will go the extra effort to make it so!",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"UPDATE: after a few months of light use, the charging case had a short circuit and neither it nor the earbuds work anymore (see left part of picture).  I'm lucky it didn't catch fire.  Originally I liked these and wrote the review below, which was honest, for the free wireless charger. If they hadn't broken, I would still rate them 4-5 stars (only issue is the lowest volume is still pretty loud).  Checking with warrantyI have been using these earbuds for a few weeks and really like them.  They charge quickly and have great sound, and the battery life is great given how small and convenient they are.  I will be getting more of these to give as gifts to my family.  A good value for the price!",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,1
"I have the Tozo NC9s, and I love them, so I decided to order the T10 specifically for use in the shower. The Tozo T10s are supposed to have physical buttons. However, the pair I received had touch sensors instead. As a result, they can't be used in the shower because drops of water will activate the touch sensors. Obviously, Tozo changed the product but are selling it through the same Amazon listing as the original T10s, so that their new product has all of the original Tozo T10's reviews to back it up. However, it is now effectively an entirely different product, and all the reviews on this Amazon listing do not pertain to it. It should therefore not be marketed on this Amazon listing-- this is highly misleading/dishonest advertising. I'm very disappointed to say the least.",1,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
"I returned these because they didn't fit any member of my family with any of the included rubber tips.  The tips are more ""slippery"" than other brands and with the weight of the bud they just perpetually fall out.  They even fall out when I am sitting still on my couch and of course are much worse when moving around.  If I wore them out of the house they would get lost the first use.  It's a shame, because they are otherwise good for the price point.  Their pair easily, sound decent, and have a well designed case.  Hopefully, the manufacturer will fix the fit issue because these buds have a lot of potential.",3,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"This is the first pair of independent wireless earbuds I have owned and I am pretty impressed. The sound quality is quite good for the tiny package and they get quite loud as well. I love the waterproof part as I bought them for chilling in the hot tub. Have used them in the shower as well to try out the waterproof element of them. The con to them, and there is really only one I can find, is that the left side will often drop out. It is losing the signal from the right side. Doesn't take much at all for this to happen and it will often do so without any obstruction between the left and right sides except your head. Get your hand or arm or something close and it's gone. All things considered though, a very nice product. I love the charging case.",4,1,2019-6-1,1,0,0

These headphones would not stay in my ear.  I have one of those ears that only allow for specific earphones.  I really liked the sound quality.  The bass was great.  It was clear.  I did not test the phone functionSadly it was not for me since it would not stay in my ear.  I tried all different things to make it work but it fell off when i was on the tread mill and I just gave up.  I do recommend since Amazon took it back without charging me.  I believe if i can stay in your ear you will like the sound quality.,3,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"Earlier this year I bought some Otium earbuds. Those were one of the best I've ever had. Quality audio, touch controls, and neat portable case/charger. Unfortunately, the beginning of the end was when I was entering a crowded space and dropped my case. One of the earbuds fell out and rolled somewhere out of view. I never saw it again.The little earbud that could was great as a bluetooth earpice and podcasts, but wasn't the same for workouts and meditation. I tried many other earbuds, but they were of mediocre quality and I really wasn't in the mood for spending more than $50. I got some decent Alloutte ones, but turns out if you sleep w/ them too often. They end up switching configuration and eventually failing. So I had to hunt for another one.",5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0

"I was skeptical at first, because earbuds are always too big to fit into my child sized ears. Even with the smallest pad, it is still a little big. However, the sound quality is amazing. It is almost as if I am right there with the artist while the artist plays music / sings. Even if I am not listening to music, I still wear these earbuds. The noise cancelling aspect is AMAZING. You have not experienced anything like it especially at this price. It’s the sound quality you would expect from a $400 earbud / headphone at $40.00! I would definitely buy more in each color and to give as gifts.",4,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"I won’t complain about the sound, it’s great. I had to use the smallest ear bud size for my ears, which I like on these because Apple headphones never stay in my ears. However, they feel a little bulky. I could get past all of this, but we have a baby sleeping in our very dark room currently, and these headphones blink with a blue light. The entire room lights up when they blink and I feel like that makes no sense to have on a pair of headphones. For that reason alone, I’ve been using my old Apple headphones at night in bed so that I’m not a bright blinking sign in bed blinding my husband next to me.",3,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"I've tried many wireless ear buds, and these are hands down the best value. They're under $50 and work great. Comfy, great sound, 2-3 hours of use on a charge, plus wireless recharging for the case. Honestly, I was really impressed. The other reviews I read before I got mine were so positive, I was prepared to be disappointed because the price is so reasonable. I don't think you can best these. Nothing's perfect through, and you do have to manually turn these off before putting them back in the car to charge, plus the button press on the buds does require a very firm push to get the button to click. Despite that, I love these!",5,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"I have weird ears and struggle to find headphones that stay in my ears and don't fall out.  I was hoping that Apple's AirPods would be an exception, but they too did not fit.  Also, the sound quality was disappointing on the Apple AirPods.  I saw that these Tozo earbuds had 10,000+ 5-star reviews and I decided take a chance on them.After charging them, the pairing was easy.  You pair the right earbud (master) to your phone and the left one (slave) pairs itself to the right one automatically.",5,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0
"These earbuds are some of the best earbuds I have listened to. After switching to a jackless iphone and having my wired earbuds break on me, I decided to change to wireless. I'm glad that these were my first choice. they are standalone buds (no connecting wires) that come with its own wireless case that fits in your pocket to allow you for more charging on the go. The sound quality it really good and really does cancel out sound well. The setup on these earbuds are almost simple, but take a bit to get used to. The left earbud may turn off when you take it out of the case, but all you need to do is press the earbud button for a few seconds. They also allow for a really good warranty for one year. Right now I am emailing customer support because one of the gold pins does not reach the earbud properly and they offered to send me a new one, take about customer service!!!!. They are also water resistant and allow for you to shower with them as well with no drop in sound quality or shorting out. For charging the case, it also comes with its own shorter usb cable (a few inches). Comes with its own instruction manual too. Everything that is listed on the site its true to its word.",5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"This was a real disappointment, unfortunately. The price is fantastic and the sound quality is surprisingly good. They stayed in my ears for a 3 mile run and were quite comfortable. The problem: the connection was dreadful. The left headphone would cut out intermittently and the right headphone (which seems to be the ""master"") would cut off completely if my phone was on my left side. It seems the Bluetooth connection on these headphones has a problem going through the body. You get what you pay for, I suppose. I'll be returning these and exchanging them for another brand.",1,1,2019-5-4,1,3,0
My husband and I were going to buy the new AirPods but at a whopping $144 we decided we can get two pair of the TOZO T 10 for less than that one pair  of AirPods would cost. We are not disappointed. The charging case fits perfectly in my gym bag and has charged my earbuds at least four times before a needing  to recharge it. I use it in the gym and when I’m cleaning house and have gone all the way upstairs and outside the house without loosing a signal. I can only compare them to the wired earphones that came with my phone but it is really no comparison. They’re easy to use pair quickly with my phone and recharge quickly.  It is nice to be hands free and have great sound quality.,5,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"I had been using Jaybirds for years and wanted to try a truly wireless pair of earbuds. The last Jaybirds I owned was the x2 so that's my comparison. I bought my Jaybirds when they were around $100.The range is a bit further than the Jaybirds, and the sound quality is similar. I think bass is a bit lacking but I didn't really notice it after a few uses. It's very ""plug and play"" and does everything I expect. On the first few uses, the left side sometimes very briefly disconnects from the right. However, it still doesn't seem to be anything that interrupts my use.",5,1,2019-7-26,1,1,0
"These were an interesting experience as they were the first true wireless ear buds I've used. The pairing was simple and quick. The sound quality was average; if your looking for quality compared to powerbeats, these aren't for you. They sit very comfortably in your ears but I sent them back because when pressing the buttons while in my ear it made them very uncomfortable. Would be better if they were switches or buttons around the edge that could be pushed from the sides instead of pushing the device into your ears deeper. The charging case lasted a week and a half from the day I opened it. The battery life is probably the best feauture on this device. Overall I like it but the pressure applied while in ear was bad enough for me to send it back. These ARE suggested for gym use. Waterproof etc ( not the charging case) make for a good workout.",4,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0

I’ll return to my personal experience addressing my pleasure with the waterproofing of the earbuds.The only negative aspect I have to mention about the earbuds was already addressed by the seller. That problem being would be the connectivity of the earbuds, the first set I received I had issues with the left earbud cutting in and out of connection. The seller immediately sent me a replacement at my request.",5,1,2019-6-12,1,0,1
I purchased these headphones for the gym. I love the deep base sound that they produce and how affordable they are. Definitely a great option with the case so they can just get tossed in a gym bag and I know it'll be safe. No cord to hastle with getting tangled up during a run or walkimg .Very excited to receive this product . very easy to connect to my phone. volume was good. did not fall out of my ear. very reasonable priced. I like that it is black. most people I know have a pair of expensive white ones. Mine works better and cost less. Quick and easy to charge. I really like that the holding case is also a usb charger.,5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
Sound quality is decent. Fits my ears pretty well with no play. a bit of ambient static in the backround but not enough to cause quality issues. I bought these because I travel for work so Ill have to update on battery life and durability after a trip or two. So far I am quite happy with them.*update* Used them for the first time as long as I could on a flight. Only had one in. Lasted a few hours and was down to 60 percent which isn't to bad. Withing the next 20 minutes it dropped to 0 percent and was hardly being used. When it hits 30 percent it blocks out your sound with an obnoxious low battery warning every 15 seconds. When I went to switch out to the other pod it was completely dead. I had fully charged the charging box before I used them for my trip and it didnt hold a charge. Extremely disappointed with battery life and health. Sound quality is still quite decent but doesnt matter much if you cant turn them on.,1,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"Like most of you, I was sitting reading the overall great reviews of this product hoping not to fall into the airpod trap. Alas, I am unsure whether or not I received a lemon or if they were just truly that bad, but mine struggle to stay connected when my phone is in my pocket. It is not a phone issue as I connect to bluetooth stuff all day (car, radio, speakers, computer etc.) I used them for 3 days, now they sit on my desk unused... really wish they did better.",1,1,2019-5-20,1,3,0

I've been through a number of headphones,earbuds, etc., but none have been as comfortable and reliable and barely noticeable as the TOZO T10s. They're fantastic. Great sound, very good noise cancelling, but not enough to not let me hear my wife if she has a question, and so comfortable I almost don't notice they're in. Plus, they're easy to connect.

"I've only had these earbuds for 2 months or so but they are already amazing. I love them so much and they are amazingly easy to take care of. Personally, I struggle with misplacing everything, including my carkeys, wallet, even my phones sometimes. The fact that these earbuds come with a lanyard to actually attach to the charging case is EXTREMELY handy so I don't keep misplacing them. I haven't been able to find another wireless headphone package that has a lanyard with it. Also, the earbuds connect separately which is really nice. Once you have them paired with your phone/device, you just take them out of their charging case and either left or right earbud automatically connects. They also pair to eachother as soon as you take them both out of the charging case, so there's no fiddling with trying to pair them together. They have amazing bass and sound quality and I can even use them while exercising or working, they don't fall out of my ears! Which is quite a feat because I have small ears in every sense of the word. I have also made several calls to family and even my boss and they said the sound quality is very nice and crystal clear!

I used it in gym (though I had to refit the buds a few times due to sweating). But now one earbud does not work at all. So I would say it has 1 year life at the most.

The battery doesn’t even last for a 4 hour flight.  And yeah, I can recharge with the case but that still means time I have no earbuds.Others also mentioned that the buds had connection issues. I haven’t had an issue with the connection dropping yet but I have had my iPhone direct a call to them while they were IN THE CASE and not even connected (or at least they shouldn’t have been connected),",3,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"I keep having these earbuds go in and out when my phone is in my pocket. This is extremely annoying as they are wireless thus meant to be enjoyed hands free. I keep having to hold my phone as I walk nearly up to my face to be able to keep the buds from trying to disconnect. I also have had problems with the buds only half connected if I take one out of my ear for a moment, leaving me with only one earbud for the rest of my gym workout until I can get back to my locket and put them back into their box to reconnect. I wish I could like these more but I charge them daily and I am still having trouble with them dropping connection throughout the day.",3,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
"Design is good -- the buds feel sturdy as does the case; they more or less stay securely in my ears (a big problem with almost every other earbud I've tried.) But the battery life is a big problem: they advertise ""over 3.5 hours’ playtime from a single charge""; I've never gotten anywhere near that. I rarely get over 2 hours of playback, which kinda sucks, since it means they barely last for a workout. The RIGHT earbud (at least in my pair) is always the one to die first; it seems to hold only about 75% of the charge as the left one. A UX gripe I have is that from the moment you get the first low-battery warning, you have about 30-seconds of playback remaining before the earbuds die. That's pretty lame; if you don't have the case with you, there's not much you can even do. The warning should signify 5-10 mins left (imo).",3,1,2019-5-22,1,0,0
My wife and I both have a pair of the T10s I also have a set of the T6.The T10s are comfortable once you figure out the right size ear plugs to use. It comes with 4 sets of rubber tips. The more snug the fit the better the sound.,5,1,2019-11-3,1,1,0
"I am 69 years old and I was clueless on how to pair the earbuds to anything.  So I went looking for a young person at our local restaurant, and sure enough in walks two young people.  I asked him if he knew how to pair bluetooth earbuds and he said that he did.  I was so excited about finding someone to help me, that I paid him for his services.  Such a nice young man!

"I like that this earbuds feel lightweight yet well made. I was using within minutes after unpacking as they were charged and charging case was almost full capacity. I did have to switch out ear tips for a more comfortable size. I cut my bluetooth on my phone and it found earbuds immediately and connected with no problems. I bought these instead of the newer model because it has clicker controls instead of touch. I touch my ears too much to consider touch. My favorite podcast sounds great! They are now 20% off of what I paid just a few days ago, so it's a good time for you to buy.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"I bought these for my mom because previously i had bought her another pair that she chose and they lasted maybe 2 months and when contacted for the warranty they did not respond. This time i chose TOZO because of the great reviews and claims of great sound. Well they definitely live up to their sound quality claim, my mom loves them and she enjoys how simple they are to use which is great that it is straight forward because things can get hard to remember for a 60yr old.

Being that I will use these mowing the lawn or working out, I don't need to impress the crowd, I just need solid sound.  They paired instantly with my IPod Nano after putting the Nano in discovery mode.  I toned down the ""auto-equalizer"" on the Nano to bass reduction, because I'm old, and they still delivered a deep  bass without killing me or have neighbors wonder why he has sub-woofers in his ears.  Really pleased.",5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0

"I've only done limited testing so far, so cannot speak to battery life yet, but overall I am very impressed with these headphones. The pairing was literally the easiest bluetooth pairing I've ever gone through; they were instantly discoverable by my phone and connected in seconds. Thanks to the multiple sizes of earbud inserts I was able to fit these comfortably in both ears (which can be a challenge as I usually need a different size in each ear). I was satisfied with the sound for what these are; They were able to convey both the high and low pitches as well as the articulation of a Mendlessohn string quartet clearly. If I were just sitting for focused listening I might wish for something with higher sound quality, but I got these to use while exercising, so they are perfect for my needs - and you can't beat the value!

"Update:  After I posted my review on these, the seller reached out to me and stated that my review sounded like my earbuds were faulty. They offered  me replacement Ones that are the T6 model. They are so much better. They work as they should and more comfortable. I’m overall impressed that I didn’t have to reach out to the seller or bug them about my faulty buds. Customer service was nice and very quick to fix the problem. The following was my T10 model review:They sound good when they work. I have issues of them constantly disconnecting and then reconnecting with lots of static or noise in them. And 9/10 times of turning them on the mic does not work. Waste of money. The positive is the battery life compared to some other ones I have had.",5,1,2020-5-1,1,1,0
"Amazing ear buds. I mostly use these at work to listen to music (classical focus, instrumental, etc) and or podcasts. They will last all day, 9hrs plus, and still be good to go in the morning without an overnight charge. They are excellent at cancelling out all the office chatter. Fit is superb, comfortable,  my ears don't hurt after wearing them all day. Some have commented that they can't get both to work at the same time. I too had that problem once, but figured out how to correct quickly. Simply place both buds back in the charging box remove them simultaneously and they will both connect.",5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0

These are exactly what I was looking for! I wear only 1 earbud for running because the noise cancellation works so well, but the sound is so good! I'm super happy with my purchase and the fact that they're so easy to charge! I've only used them a full day so far, so if anything changes (which from the other posts I'm doubting this) I'll update my review. Right now I'm so impressed with them, I've told my husband and son to grab a pair. Love the option of white as well, I prefer it over the black.",5,1,2019-8-15,1,0,0
"We have two pairs of these. My husband, who hates gadgets of all kinds, really enjoys them and uses them all the time to listen to books and podcasts.

Also, my husband wears them while exercising and he sweats a lot. He’s had his for several months now with no issues due to the excellent waterproofing.",5,1,2020-3-16,1,0,0
"Nice product, paired very easily, worked fine 95% of the time, had occasional cutout but couldn't determine if it was due to head position or phone position or maybe wifi connectivity.  Worked fine sitting around the house or working in the driveway but did not stay in ears when on a jog, had to constantly re-position every 10 strides as they felt they were going to fall out of my ears.  Tried a larger size cup to keep them in but same issue.  Really wanted them for this reason, running, to get rid of the wire which hangs on my other set of Beats.  So, going back to the Beats which actually have volume control on them, these Tozo's do not have volume control you have to reach into your pocket to adjust the volume.  Too bad, they were nice otherwise.",3,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0
"The positive: these earbuds are quite phenomenal especially for the price. They have a nice sound quality at both ends of the sound spectrum— very nice highs and amazing lows. The fact that they are water resistant is a nice added bonus. They pair easily and maintain the connection well at the specified distance.The negative: if the earbuds are not seated perfectly in the ear, there is a huge problem with the reproduction of the bass end and I find that this perfect placement can be difficult to achieve. In general, I find that I have  to remove them and put them back several times, each time I wear them to get a good seal. Finally, the battery life is no where near what is specified. The max I get is 2.5 hours of continued use, as opposed to 4 as is specified. Further, the case will charge the earbuds 2.5 times at best and then it needs to be recharged.",4,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0

The sound quality is great, battery life is great, it has wireless charging and it’s water prof. Only thing I can’t get used to yet is that the audio doesn’t pause automatically when I take out the earbud and I need to tap on them in order to pause.

I purchased these earbuds so I could retire my powerbeats 3 while working out. My beats still work but I wanted some earbuds without any wires. I purchased these because of the price and the five star reviews.  I am kind of disappointed with these. My major problem with these earbuds is the fact that the right earbud has a lower volume when compared to the left one. For some reason the left earbud sounds normal while the right one barely can be heard. I looked through reviews and the questions section and found others are having this problem as well. I found that by tapping/hitting the top of the right earbud makes the sound match the left ear bud. After hitting/tapping the earbud they start to work as intended until you turn them off and turn them back on again.  I think these are good but I wouldn't recommend them.,2,1,2019-6-12,1,0,0
"The earbuds would be pretty great if they could actually stay in the ear. Tried all the different ear tips/molds but they never stay in. Especially when talking or moving.

It's very nice and easy to charge/use. The sound quality is not as good as like The newest BOSE headphones But it's very good and much cheaper. Very good noise cancellation and the battery life is so satisfying. If you buy the wireless charger you don't even need to Plug in the box and the hours of battery life is enough but if you don't think it is then keep in mind when you don't use them put them in the box and it will charge them and if you are at home With the headphones but not using the box charge the box and you can recharge the headphones when you need to.,4,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0

For me it’s often the case, 15 minutes into wearing the headphones and ears start to hurt. Not with these ones! I haven’t tried them working out, but I walked and moved a lot and they stay put. Good noise isolation. TV was on in the room and I was listening to the audio book. The sound of the tv was completely blocked. Easy to control by clicking on any of the earbuds, left or right. I didn’t have any problems pairing them and after a long break they resumed the sound right away. Very satisfied with this purchase!",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,1
"I LOVE these wireless earbuds. I use them at work, usually 1 at a time so I can hear the phone and answer questions. The sound is great. They pair really easily. They fit snugly but don’t hurt. I don’t know if they would stay in doing hardcore calisthenics but should be fine for running or walking. 1 feature I really like is that you can push on the earbuds for a pause/play function so you don’t have to remove the earbuds if someone is talking to you. I got the tan color so they just blend right in. Totally worth the price and I would totally buy again. Fyi... you can get up to about 30 feet from the device you are paired to before it disconnects. Also... I accidentally left 1 earbud in my scrubs pocket that was washed AND dried and it still works fine. Total shocker! These are so great and I have ordered a second pair so I can keep some at work and some at home. Worth the money!",5,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"I was looking to replace my wired headphone with decent earbuds and don't spend a fortune. When I saw these here I figured, that I can give it a try for a price less than $50. So far I think, that is a perfect fit. I use them occasionally, when I work on my back yard or when I watch movies at home late at night. I like the sound, the fit and a wireless charging option. I have seen some complaints here about pairing and loosing connection, but I did not experience any of these. They paired with my iPhone right away and I tried to walk around to see, if they loose connection, but nothing happened. If you want to get the best sound quality, pick the correct size of the silicon tips, that come with earbuds. That would make a whole world of a difference in your user experience (both fit and sound). 1 year warranty comes as a bonus, so for that money, if they will last more, than a year I will be happy.",5,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0

"After recently washing a pair of my PowerBeats corded earbuds I figured it was time to step up my game to some wireless earbuds. But once I saw the price of the name brand I quickly rethought that decision. Once I realized I would be looking at a good $200-$300 to replace the prior model, I shifted my focus towards budget ear buds. When I did a search on Amazon and these came up I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of positive reviews they had already received. So I went ahead and purchased both models T10/T6's being that they were so inexpensive, I figured if one of the pairs was lackluster I would get a refund. However, I love them BOTH and I'll tell you why! We will start with the T10's, these are the older model of the two pairs.Tozo T10: Slightly larger drive than the T6's - Perfect for folks with bigger ear canals.

"I bought these hoping to find a quality bass sounding replacement for my Airpod Pros. I felt like the Airpod Pros had little to no bass and at full volume were too quiet.  These T10 models did just the trick.  Deep bass and at max volume they are about twice as loud.  I listen at about 60 percent, which is still louder then the Airpods at max volume.I work in a shop with lots of fans and ac running, so it's very loud in there. These block out the background noise a little better then the Airpods did.  And they stay put, where as the Airpods would fall out as I got busy working and sweaty, same at the gym.  No problems keeping them in place with the T10s.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"I want to start by saying they have given great customer service.  The first pair they sent seemed to be a little faulty, cutting out quite a bit in the left bud.  They replaced that in short order with a new set, which were considerably better.  There's still some spottiness that I cannot really figure out as the phone is RIGHT next to them, but overall I'm satisfied.  I was about 20 yards away the other day in the gym and they were working great.As for packaging, I love the case they come with.  It holds its now charge, so when you put them back into the box they charge even if you're not on a charging pad or plugged in.  Well done there.  The sound is quite good when loud and they fit and stay in place well.  I do some long bike rides, and they did cut out at about 2 hours of continuous usage.

Wireless distance isnt super far if you get away from your phone, but for the price they do well and I dont have to worry too much about destroying them.  Had one earbud stop working on me. It would play for a little bit and then just shut off.  Customer service was great and took care of it for me!  I'd highly recommend.Charging case is a nice feature.

My only issue at the moment is the fact that every time I take the buds out of the case the volume gets increased to the max. It's really annoying and pretty deafening when you forget to turn the volume down before playing something. I'm not sure if this is normal or a defect, but it's the reason behind my 4 star review.

I used them this morning to workout and one fell out of my ear 3 times within the workout. Oh you can order a new earbud for $25.  I’m sure it cost the company  $25 to make one earbud.  So that means to me this company will gouge you if you happen to lose an earbud.  Also, the sound quality wasn’t there and there isn’t any noise cancellation with these.

While I like the charging case, I do wish there was also a non-charging case option included.  Fit is a little off for me.  Even though the earbuds come with a few different ear cap sizes, I unfortunately find myself somewhere between small and medium.  A calm walk is enough movement at times to pop them out of my ears.  Indoors, the connectivity is decent.  I can be in the room adjacent to my phone and still use the earbuds without issue.  Outdoors is another story.  As long as my phone is on me, connectivity is generally uninterrupted.  Set the phone down, though, and the range changes for reasons I have yet to figure out.  After a couple of months of occasional usage, the right earbud ceased working.  I contacted the company as I was still under warranty and received a friendly response within 24 hours.

They come with 4 different sizes of tips, and once I found the right size, it just took a little twisting to adjust the placement in my ear to block out noise and get the best sound. The batteries seem to last a decent time on a charge (haven’t timed it), but I’ve only had them a couple weeks so I can’t speak to longevity. Can immediately tell a huge difference between these and others I’ve tried and hope they’ll last!",5,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
Update 10-20-19I was really happy with the earbuds (despite the lack of volume control) until a few days ago. The left earbud will not hold a charge for more than a couple of hours while the right one can go for 5 or more. It's too bad since these are the first buds that actually stay in my ears.,2,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"It's the thrid wireless earbuds I got from Amazon. I returned previous two. So far, it's the best one I had and I'm happy. Good sound quality and loud enough for gym use. range is also good. Connection to phone is also good so far. Only once when I walk outside and put the phone in my left pocket and the main bud, which is in my right ear, the sound is cut off constantly, there may be some interference in that area. When I switch phone to my righ pocket and it's back to normal. Hopefully it will keep working and I can keep it. I really like the sound, can wear it all day long.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
Sound quality is out of this world. My husband insisted that I order him a pair as well!  Love these because they light up when you need to charge them but once fully charged they last a very long time. Easy to pair and store in their little storage case. Buds recharge as long as the case is charging. All blue lights mean it is fully charged while the red lights indicate which bud needs to be charged. You can utilize one bud while the other charges. Use them at work and they help my night go by fast!,5,1,2020-9-30,1,0,1
"Wow they sound horrible!! They seem to function okay but who cares they sound absolutely horrible. I saw all the positive reviews and believed them. Sounds like they are milliseconds apart on sound delivery. They are not loud at all. Using the classic LG tone 730 neckband as a benchmark at 10. These are not even a 3. Otherwise they work well as a bluetooth for phone calls. Very disappointed. Keep in mind I haven't listened to any other ""totally wireless"" earbuds. Maybe they all just suck.",1,1,2019-11-7,1,2,0
"I had hoped to use these for various meeting apps via Computer, and read that it was supported.  HOwever, clearly it doesn't work, tried four different computers, get it to connect to bluetooth, then it goes into a  connecting/disconnecting loop. Once in a while I can hear audio through them from the computer, but no mic etc.For a wireless phone headset and music they do work well, although getting them to pair with the phone can be a bit cumbersome at times for little reason.",3,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"So, since I got an iPhone 8 with no headphone jack, I decided it would be great in many ways to go wireless. After trying SO many different types and brands, I found these babies. I bought my first pair then, like 2 years ago? They’re still going strong. The sound. OMG. The sound. Unbelievable. It’s perfect and I am very fussy. I don’t even need to use the equalizer! It’s amazing. Now I have an iPhone XR. (I hate it). But, I just bought this pair as a back up as my current pair has some miles on them! The price is great and OMG. The sound..",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0

"These are so great! I’ve used several other brands of earbuds and these by far are the best. They have a good length of battery, plus they come with the charging pack. I choose to use mine separately rather than a pair because then I can listen to music all day while I work my 10 hr shifts. The sound quality is great and they are so easy to pair. I don’t have to turn them on or pair them each time, just pull it off the charging dock and it automatically pairs and turns on to play or be ready to take a call. They also have a lot of different sized earpieces which I love because I have smaller ears. It allowed me to find the perfect fit and not feel uncomfortable later in the day. I love these and would recommend to anyone.",5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"On the positive:Easy pairing makes it easy for anyone to operate and the fit seems secure, although I have yet to workout with them. A few walls gave me connection problems at work, but that's to be expected. I'll be testing the range at the gym today and battery life on the trails this weekend. I'm looking forward to a solid wireless experience!",2,1,2019-5-17,1,0,0
All over I like the look and the touch and feel. They fit perfectly. BUT unfortunately the connection to any device works only great if I am not moving. With every little bounce the music stops. Worse and more sensitive than running with a disc man back in the day. Very sad since those are the first headphones I liked in design and comfort,1,1,2020-6-3,1,1,0
"I just received these amazing earbuds. I already have a pair of AirPods but I wanted something more compact and less conspicuous so I settled on these because of the ratings. I also wanted something non-white that didn’t protrude from my ears. Well, the ratings are accurate and these earbuds fit the bill. They compact, waterproof, cool looking and, most importantly, sound amazing. I also love the fact that I paid 2/3 less than what I paid for the AirPods. A win/win/win!!!Update. The earbuds stopped working after only 1 week and I haven’t been able to contact customer service. I’m returning for a refund. Do not buy.",1,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
"These earbuds are great quality for the price. These are by far my favorite earbuds in this price range, other brands to not offer the deep base and ""showerproofness"" lol ; there are many times I am relieved that I can use my earbuds in the shower.Overall, if you don't want to spend too much money on true wireless headphones, I recommend you to buy this one. In the last 2 years I bought about 4 wireless earbuds, and this one is the best so far.",5,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"These are the first wireless earbuds that I've owned. I've had them now for about two months. At first, I found them very uncomfortable and they would not stay in my ear. That issue was resolved once I reread the instructions and realized that I was wearing them in the wrong orientation. Now they fit comfortably and stay in my ear. I personally really like the sound quality. They have quite a substantial bass enhancement. If you like lots of bass, then you will like these. If you don't, then these may not be for you. The only issue I encountered with these was limited range. I could only go about 5 to 10 feet from my Bluetooth device before it would lose connection. I contacted TOZO's customer support and they determined them to be defective. They quickly resolved the issue by immediately shipping me a new pair. I was completely impressed with their customer service. I give their customer service 10 out of 10. They seem well built and durable. They say that they are waterproof but I haven't tested that yet. They come with a nice rechargeable case, usb charging cable, and an assortment of different sized earbuds. In summary, if you like enhanced bass, give these a try.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"March 21 2020 update:After seeing this review Tozo contacted me to see if I’d like to try the next step up, the T6 buds. On first impression they are definitely nicer. When I took them off the charger the lights turned off and suggests it’s storing it’s charge instead of using it to keep the buds charged and draining the battery. The fit is about the same but the actual rubber interacts are better. They sound great. Looking forward to testing them out in the world when we’re allowed back into the world! Thanks Tozo!",5,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"I got tired of using wired earphones because they break on me really easily, so I was looking for wireless earphones that will last me a long time. I'm not going to lie; I was really apprehensive before buying these earphones because I've never spent more than $20 on earphones and I was afraid of making a wrong investment. After looking through several wireless earphones, I decided to settle on these Tozo ones due to the overall positive reviews. I LOVE THESE EARPHONES! I love how I can't hear any outside noise when I have these on, so the noise cancellation aspect of these earphones is excellent. I was afraid that these earphones won't be able to withstand high volumes, but to my satisfaction, whatever you're listening to can get very loud if you want to increase the volume. When it comes to earphones, I don't care for the bass quality much, thus I prefer a clean sound. However, I immediately noticed these earphones have a good amount of bass for those who appreciate it while the sound still sounds clear. These TOZO earphones charge quite quickly and easily unlike other wireless earphones that need to be charged often. They automatically fit into their respective spots inside the charging box, and the box is small and compact enough that you can take it anywhere. I'd say one whole charge would last about three-four hours, maybe, and it doesn't take long for the earphones to charge up. For those worried about the earphones hurting or not fitting their ears, there are different sized tips, so you can try on each one and find the right size. These earphones also stay in your ears even if you dance and jump around a lot like how I do. BY THE WAY, they really are waterproof! I dropped them a few times into water accidentally, and after a wipe down, they still work like normal. I really recommend these TOZO earphones!!! I'm planning to buy another pair for my mother as a gift.",5,1,2019-4-11,1,0,1
"I have gone through two of these in the last week, both of which were defective.  The first worked completely but when placed on a wireless charger, the bottom-left side of the battery case would become extremely hot (so much so that it made the charging pad overheat as well).  I set up an exchange with Amazon and received my second unit in two days.  That one would not even charge on a wireless charger (though USB charging worked fine).  I tested both of these units on multiple wireless chargers that have charged and continue to charge my phone just fine and reproduced both of their issues.  I intend to replace with a different brand and steer clear of this brand in the future.",1,1,2019-6-3,1,1,0
"I’m experimenting with truly wireless headphones and wanted to try something inexpensive to start with.  I am actually shocked at how good these are and how well they sound.  They appear to be really well made, pair easily and the sound quality is really good.  Based on the design and how you insert and twist the ear buds they are really good at isolating outside sound.I use them when I’m lifting weights since you don’t want wires but I’ve taken to using them on the treadmill and elliptical as well.  They do not loosen or fall out of your ears - very nice.  The thing they don’t do is control volume but you can stop/start the music.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"can't complaint about the headphone for the price I bought it for. great alternative to answer phone calls when driving and can be used to watch movie on airplane. if you remove one ear plug then the other, each ear plug can only work by itself. you ended up only hear sound from one of them. So, if you want to hear sound from both ear plugs, you need to remove them from the case together. If bluetooth is disconnected then reconnected, these ear pieces don't reconnect to your phone automatically, you have to do it manually. not a deal breaker, still love the convenience of these ear plugs.",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"When shopping around for new bluetooth headphones, I came across these TOZO T10s.  It was important to me that 1) they stayed in my ears while being active. 2) That the sound was great and 3) Noise cancelling was highly effective.  After having these for 2 weeks, I can confidently state that these have checked all those boxes.  It is important to get the right bud size to ensure a tight fit and sound profile.  You may have to test out the different sizes to do so.  Another nice feature is the auto connect process.  Simply just pull the buds out of the charging case and they turn on and connect.  It is quite fast and impressive.I give the TOZO T10 a 5 star rating for meeting my needs. Some ""nice to haves"" would be track and volume control (it does have pause/play) but definitely not a deal breaker.",5,1,2019-6-12,1,1,0
"The left earbud stopped working after less than 30 days. Not cool. Great price, but I would pay more for earbuds that work longer than three weeks. I really enjoyed them initially, until they stopped  workingUpdate: TOZO customer service got back to us and apologized for the defective ear bud and sent us a set of their newer updated model. We gave it 3 weeks testing it against a MAJOR competitor in wireless earbuds and the new set is 100% good to go. Changed from 1 star to 4 star based on the product and just as important the service 👏🏼",4,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"I’ve never been able to find headphones/ear buds that fit perfectly into my ear without falling out. over the years, i got over the ear headphones and those end up hurting my ears from the pressure of them. i also bought the new airpod pros thinking they would be different and unfortunately they fall out constantly. i spent more time focusing on them not falling out/shoving them back in my ears than i did listening to my music. i tried one more time trying to find new earphones and came across this pair Tozo wireless headphones. i read the reviews and saw a lot of customers having the same issue previously with other headphones falling out and not staying in their ears so i tried them out. it’s been about a month since having them and i absolutely love them. they have different size earbuds to fit your ear and luckily for me, the medium size ones fit perfectly. the sound quality is great and i can feel the bass and not hearing any outside noise. the charge on these last forever too. i’m just happy i finally found my go to earbuds.",5,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"I have really enjoyed the convenience and ease of use.  I am new to blue tooth ear buds and I am quite happy  with these.  The battery life lasts for several hours, I put them back in the charger when done and have yet to run low during my usual routines, listening to music while doing chores, talking on the phone, etc.  I used the smallest ear size adapters and they stay in just fine but you do need to follow the instructions and twist the bud backwards into place.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.  I have not tested them in water, hope I never have to!!! Other reviews say they are fine to get wet so I would believe it, having seen other features match with what other reviewers are saying.",5,1,2019-8-27,1,0,0

"These sound great. They are loud enough, which is not always the case for Bluetooth headphones. They pair with my phone quickly and easily. The charging case seems to be good quality. Great sound cancellation and price point. All good things. But there is one major flaw; at least with the set I received. The batteries don’t last! Seems like I only get an hour of use before I get low battery warnings, which are also far too frequent; chiming in about every 20 seconds. Then they die. This has happened to me after each full charge. If the batteries lasted as long as advertised these would be a five star product all day. However, I am probably going to return them. I might order a second set after in hopes this particular set is defective because I really do like them otherwise.",1,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
"Love the color, did not want the black ones most companies have. I did not get the extra earbud pads but after contacting Amazon customer service I was given a gift certificate that enables me to purchase the extra pads separate. Great customer service! The sound quality of these is good. My husband has Samsung buds and I think these are as good sound as his. Connection and pairing was very fast and easy.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants a great set of earbuds at a very good price. I even tried the quick charge with my phone charger and it works great.",5,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"I purchased these wireless earbuds to drown out the noise of fireworks from sundown to sunset and the chatter of my neighbors. I usually have speakers blaring, but I could still hear the outside sounds. My speakers are loud also, and we have a noise ordinance here I abide by. These earbuds provide superior sound quality, are comfortable to wear, and are premium earbuds. The earbuds were worth the price. The case charges fast along with the earbuds, and they both hold a charge for an extended period. I love them. Thank you!",5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"I have no idea why these are so highly rated. They sound horrible. Literally zero bass, treble is to high, and mid is to low. Sure you can use just one, but only the right side, the left won’t work unless it’s paired to the right. The battery life is bad.And redial??? Really?! Who needs redial? That horrible “feature” made me accidentally call my mother and wake her up at 3am her time.",2,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"Oh wow! These earbuds are awesome! I just received them last night. They were already partially charged so it only took about 20 min for full charge. They fit really good in my ears, I'm using the smallest one.  The sound is very loud and clear with a lot of bass.  I had to turn it down. The instructions are clear and easy simple straight to the point and easy to comprehend. I was skeptical because the last pair I had to return because the instructions weren't clear and in bad English and the pairing process was horrible. These are the complete opposite. So worth purchasing.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,1

"I have tried many types of bluetooth headphones. I purchased these about a month ago and have used them multiple times since. I waited to make a review to make sure I liked them. The sound quality is great. The comfort is great. At first when I pulled them out of the box,  I was afraid they were going to be huge in my ear, because I have smaller ears, but they come with different silicone fittings. After switching to the smaller ones, they fit great. I love all the features of these, including the wireless charging.  10 out of 10 recommend.",5,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0
"Great product for the price. I initially had a little issue in fitting perfectly in my ear as my ear holes are very small, but even with the smallest ear cap, it stays put in well.Update to 4 stars after using it in multiple locations with different noise levels:  If you want to mainly listen to the songs with phone in your pocket, this is the right product with good sound quality. If you want to pick up calls in noisy environment, it is terrible. If you want to take a call in very quiet environment, this works fine. Also, the bluetooth range was very low than I thought, the call quality degrades as soon as I am at the other end of room with my cell charging in corner. So the 33 ft is not true range to have clear call/songs.",4,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"I bought these specifically because they were advertised as “waterproof “. The first time I used them, the left earbud fell out and dropped to the bottom of a 4’ pool. I picked them up within 30 seconds and placed back into my ear. The next day no sound would come out of it. I attempted to swim freestyle with the right earbud the following day. This time anytime the earbuds were submerged, it would mute. Eventually, it muted altogether. Both sides don’t work now, so I returned them.Update 8/9/19:",3,1,2019-5-27,1,0,0
"I have Apple Airpods, and they're convenient (I have all Apple gear), but the sound is thin and noise comes through. Not so with these - make sure to try the different tips to the earbuds to find the best fit, and then *boom* when you put them in, you will almost hear nothing other than your sound source. And the bass is very good and deep. Pairing is more difficult than AirPods of course, but it works fine once you get the hang of it. The range is pretty good. Love that they're waterproof, so it's OK to have them in when swimming (above the water). It's great to hang out at the pool with these and listening to music or audiobooks my Apple Watch, not worrying about water damage ;-) A great value for the money!",5,1,2019-8-29,1,0,1
"I have never used bluetooth headphones or earbuds. So I thought I would give these a try after watching multiple reviews on YouTube. ToZo had high ratings on most review sites and I can ""hear"" why. The sound quality is excellent. Great bass. The charging case is compact and easy to use. I have not evaluated the noise cancelling ability, but gave it four stars anyway. It did take several attempts to get the buds to pair and then pair with my new phone. I believe this was due to my inexperience,  so you may need to attempt pairing multiple times. However, once accomplished, the buds pair quickly and the music sound is excellent. You will not regret purchasing these little gems. I am a happy customer and kudos to ToZo for their quality product at an excellent price point.",5,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0
"Bottom line - great set of buds.  Bluetooth connection is solid and sound quality is very good.  I especially like how each bud ""talks"" to you - lets you know if it's connected, if battery levels are getting low, etc.  Much easier to discern than some patter of ""beeps""  If I  had to critique at all I would note that for all the ""sound enhancing"" that is going into these things, it is not ""flat EQ"" set of clarity coming from these.  Low end especially is dressed up a bit but for what these deliver overall for a true set of wireless buds, I am totally satisfied!  Hopeful they will last a good few years.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"I use sound isolating headphones when I'm out doing yard work. I enjoy listening to music when working but also need good sound isolation to protect my hearing from loud yard equipment. These headphones meet both of those requirements. As for sound isolation, at a medium volume I had no problem hearing the music over the noise from the lawn equipment.I listen to online music - Pandora, Tunein, etc- when I use these headphones. I'm pretty particular about headphones, when it comes to sound quality. I like a full range sound, not muffled and solid bass. These have great bass, without being overpowering and clear highs. It usually takes me about 60-90 minutes to finish the yard so no issues with battery life.",5,1,2019-6-27,1,0,0

I was afraid of the earbuds falling out and initially they did but I switched to the smallest size and they fit perfectly! The charging case has a nice magnet that keeps it closed (I was afraid of a clasp breaking overtime because I'm clumsy and will likely drop it eventually)!Plus!!

They were quick to give me replacement earbuds that do work better than the original ones I was sent however the case only charges my ear buds about 1.5 full charges, where as soundpeats ear buds case lasted well over a month with using them 5 days a week, 2.5 hours a day.

The sound is amazing, they cancel noise pretty darn well, she has even taken them in the shower a few times and they work exactly as they should. The one concern about them she has is the earbuds can't be far away from each other. She likes to use only one bud most of the time. So when she's video calling her friends she has to carry the other ear bud on her. She can't just leave it laying down on her desk and walk around the room.

My previous earphones had wire that would get tangled or pull out of ears. These have no wire so they never fell out while I moved or yanked heavy water hose around gardens. Noise cancellation is great when neighbor is mowing lawn. Worth my money and I'm happy I did not have to buy expensive other brands. Charging case is conveniently small and compact does not take up space even in my small purse. Bluetooth and pairing was easy with cell, car, mp3 player. I can wear it comfortably even with my tragus hoops on.",5,1,2019-8-13,1,0,1

After some simple troubleshooting it was determined that a new set was in order.  Without requiring the return of the original earbuds they sent me a complete new set.  The new set works much better.  They still cut in and out on the rare occasion but the sound quality is quite good when connected.  I generally wear them mowing the grass and the noise cancellation works great for that.,4,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"I've had several sets of BT ear buds and for the price you cannot get the sounds that these bad boys offer.

The good fit is important for the nice sound. Set up was very easy to pair with my Note 20 Ultra. I've used them mostly on the bike listening to music from my phone however I've also paired them to the bike when I want to listen to the class.

"These work fine overall, sound better than the TaoTronics equivalent and quickly connect with each other 3-4 times you take them out of the box. The 4th time you might have to put them back in and take them out once or twice, but then they usually connect to each other again. The primary challenge I'm experiencing is that even though they are paired with my phone, they cannot connect to it automatically when I take them out of the box. Each time I want to use them I have to go to the settings on my phone and select the TOZO option from my paired bluetooth list.These are the only bluetooth device I've ever own that requires this extra step. Consequently, I can never just pop them into your ears and start listening. Every time I want to use them I have to take that extra step. Ultimately, I use the TaoTronics version more often because they don't have this issue, nor did any of the other 20+ bluetooth headphones I've owned over the years. Of coure the TaoTronics version has it's own severe problems because they often can't connect to each other, but that's for another review.",5,1,2019-6-6,1,0,0
For the price I suppose the sound is pretty good. Nothing outstanding. We got these for Christmas and have had some time to use them. The biggest negative is that they don’t turn off so the battery could last when they aren’t in use. The do not last even 3 hours. The case is also a charger but it drains when not in use too. We will be looking for others.UPDATE: The company contacted me and offered to upgrade and replace one of the three pairs I bought. The upgrade seems to last much longer and be better quality. Thank you!,2,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"I have sensitive ears and have always had trouble wearing headphones/earbuds for more than a few minutes at a time without considerable discomfort. This is the first pair I have ever tried that I can wear for hours with no problem.Not an audiophile, I'm satisfied with the sound quality. As long as there's no hissing or popping/crackling, I'm a happy camper.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"These headphones are great for the money, no complaints. The battery life, noise cancelling and sound quality are fantastic. One comment, and not even a complaint, they do have really strong bass. When listening to music the bass (for me) is nice. When listening to talk radio or podcasts I really wish I had a way to tone down the bass some. Background music, transition / intro music just really pops over the verbal dialogue going on. Not a deal breaker for me felt it was worth mentioning. If you like a lot of bass, you'll enjoy. If you're looking for something a little more natural then you might want to take this comment into consideration.",4,1,2020-1-8,1,1,0
"Sound quality is great tho I'm still learning how to not have them fall out of my ears. I followed directions. The enclosed and online leave instructions a lot to be desired.Much bigger issue: Huge complaint unfortunately. I had  no problem connecting these earbuds to my samsung phone, but my new samsung tablet refuses to connect. What am I missing? Please help! I earlier purchased the navy, but L and R unreadable on buds so I exchanged and bought white. At least that's now clearly readable. But, on previous earbuds, I connected to tablet first, no problem but could not connect to cell. Is this a one device for only for pairing up earbuds? Please Help!!",1,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"I was hesitant to go bluetooth, but since many of the major smartphone manufacturers have abandoned headphone jacks I guess it became inevitable.I really didn't want something else to charge, but the case makes it easy.

"I ordered these Earbuds and they are actually pretty good. I got them back in July and have used them pretty much everyday. Well a couple of days ago the right earbud just stopped working, so I contacted the company and they are amazing, they tried helping me figure out what may have been the issue and after we checked everything out they decided to replace it. They have awesome customer service, very quick to reply and I will definitely be using them for any future items.",5,1,2020-9-29,1,2,0
"I am very picky about my earbuds. My ear shape doesn't allow for a lot of other brands, and I do not want bulky over the ear/head headphones.  I'm always skeptical about earbuds because they usually will fall out or hurt my ears.  With TOZO T10 I didn't have this issue.Product came in a compact neat package, with multiple earbud sizes and a charge cord for the case.  It was easy to follow instructions. The ear buds and case came with a partial charge.  I was able to get it synced and started using them within 2 minutes of opening the package and pairing it with my phone. I swapped out the ear bud piece size for something a bit larger to fit securely in my ear.  I was able to shake my head violently and the buds stayed in place.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"I was excited for these ear buds because they look very nice and have a lot of features I was interested in. However, the sound quality with any music platform is awful. The earbuds are constantly cutting in and out on both sides. What good are ear buds if you can't listen to music? Perhaps the product I received were duds? Disappointed.",1,1,2020-7-21,1,1,0
"I bought these on January 25, 2019. It's 11 months later, and I've been using them very frequently since then. Averaged out, it might be every other day. Beyond every day listening, which I do quite a bit, I like to pop one in before I go to bed (I sleep on my side) and listen to a meditation before I go to sleep, so they've gotten a lot of use. They connect to my Android phone easily and quickly every time I take them out of their case. The sound is great. I'm really to earbuds that don't have enough warm bass, but these are pretty amazing, in my opinion. I don't blast my music, so I can't say anything about loudness, but if you like warm, soft sounds, these will do the trick.",5,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0
"I have had these for over two weeks and have had an amazing experience with them. Probably the only downfall is that when I eat they fall out sometimes, otherwise they stay put for hours on end. I haven’t tried the mic with calls with them so I can’t comment on the quality there but according the the comments I’ve seen the mic is really bad. Like I said I have no idea though. The bass is AMAZING. The sound quality definitely caters towards music. So if that’s why you’re buying them for they’re great.Now to address some of the bad reviews I’ve seen; I have not had a single problem with disconnections. I can be on the second floor of the house and they still have perfect connection.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"First off let me say, these airbuds are super comfortable, I can wear them all day without them hurting ears. I bought an expensive one from BB and had to return them a week later because they were so uncomfortable.  But I love TOZO T10.  In regards to the noise cancellation, my true test would be on plane and so far I haven’t taken them on a plane.  However, on the subway, they block out most outside noise.For the sound, this is one of the main reason, I purchased this T10. The sounds, especially the bass is amazing, crystal clear withnot distortion even when the volume is high.  The Bluetooth pairing  is breeze, and I like that you listen to one side only if needed.",5,1,2019-4-25,1,0,0
"I've always had to manage my expectations when it came to wireless earbuds. Either sound quality was compromised in the interest of functionality, or vice versa. These really are fantastic. Really great bass response and good, clear upper midrange and treble. If I had to nitpick, lower midrange could be a bit more prominent (Apple, please give me an EQ!) to give music more warmth.I found the largest earbuds to give the best bass response, though they did get a bit uncomfortable after prolonged listening. Really pleased with how quickly they pair and connect, and call quality isn't bad either. These are a win!",5,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"I never had a pair or wireless earbuds, so I decided to look for some. I initially wanted the airpods but I honestly did not want to spend the money on them. So I looked into some other affordable brands. Tozo being the best seller on Amazon I went ahead and bought some with very little research, and I mean reading a few written reviews.  I went on a whim and bought them . Received then the next day . Packaging was great !  Unboxed them and was very happy . Immediately paired them with my phone. Does everything I want it to do and awesome sound!!!!! Blocks out the world too. Lol stays in my ear which is a plus for me. I like that they're waterproof, although I won't be swimming with them. I also like that the earbuds come with a wireless charging box that you can carry with you while you're out and about!!!! Love these bad things!",5,1,2020-3-2,1,1,0
"I use these headphones mainly for running. I’m training for a marathon and some of my runs have been as long as 4 hours. These headphones have stood up well to the sweat and I have yet to have them die on a run. I also like to use them to talk on the phone or listen to an audiobook while I’m cleaning etc.After two months I was sad to find that the right ear bud would no longer charge. I contacted the seller and they offered some troubleshooting advice. When that did not fix the issue, they honored the one year warranty and sent me a new pair.",5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
Update:Their customer service is excellent. They have gone above and beyond to make things right. They are sending me the T6 (upgraded version). Not many companies are willing to do this to make sure their customers are happy. Kudos.,5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"Sound quality, noise cancelation, and ear fitting is great! The only thing about these earbuds is pairing can get confusing. JUST FOLLOW DIRECTIONS ! When you initially get them and pair them for the first time the device you are using will try and pair the buds separately, don't try and pair separate. Take both buds out and and let the right earbud pair with left earbud. This might take 30 secs. Once the the earbuds are paired  then you will only see the right earbud as a selection to pair with your device. Pair the right earbud to your device and even though your device shows only right is paired both earbuds will work.  If it fails the first time its okay. Delete the earbuds from your device and try it again. I had to attempt it twice and now they work perfect!",5,1,2019-8-8,1,0,1
"Got these because I rarely use earbuds, but have always wanted wireless for the rare times I use them to listen to zen/calming music on my walk to work.Being on calls during social isolation is what sparked me to try these.

I love these earphones. The built quality and the fit to my ear is phenomenal.  This is better than the Airpods and the Bose Sport.  The bass that these provides is super rich and deep.  The sound is really immersive.  It is like being in front of the stage listening to the artist sing live.The bluetooth connection is great. It is stable. I used this 3hours straight and no hiccups. The sound quality is superb all throughout.  Charging is also great because you can use your wireless charging pad.  Very convenient.,5,1,2019-5-13,1,0,0
"Does not hold it's charge.  Every time I try to use, the battery is low and I need to plug it in.  What is the purpose of charging the base if it doesn't hold it's charge and keep the earbuds ready for use?UPDATE: The company reached out to me and sent me a different model T6 earbuds for me to try and the sound is good (much better base), it keeps it's charge but I gave it 4 stars because sometimes the connection gets spotty when I go for a walk or run.  Other than that, I appreciate the company reaching out and making and effort. Thank you.",4,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
"You get what you pay for.I do experience the connection issues others have mentioned in their reviews. I drive a lot for my job and experience “deadzones” here and there but this is ridiculous. The earbuds disconnect from each other for like a microsecond and play sound again. It’s not annoying to me yet, but it is rather disappointing since it happened a mere day after receiving them, and it happens very frequently, at least 2-4 times an hour.",2,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
"These stay in my ears.  That alone makes them better than the main name brand, which I can't keep from falling out.  Sound quality is excellent for music, podcasts, and conference calls.  I haven't tested the waterproofness, but it's great to know it's there.  I like that the case is small and sturdy - it doesn't scratch easily.  Battery life is very good.

Now for the things I don't like so much.  Number one, I purchased these about 6 months ago and have used them almost exclusively in the office.  Today when I used them, the sound faded in and out almost like they were going in and out of connection.  Really announcing, not really worth using like this.  I also don't like the fact that they drain the case battery.  If you put them in the case and don't plug the case in, both will be dead in a couple days.  Also, the battery life in my experience is about 3 hours, I do wish it was longer.  I've tried running with them a couple times and they lose connection every few steps and are hard to keep in.",2,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0

I use my cell phone and mount it on the wall and while I'm taking my time showering I watch some YouTube videos. Like I said they worked pretty well for a while. I did have some trouble keeping them in my ears  but I was able to deal with it. Not even a month into using them the left ear bud stopped holding a charge. I exchanged them for the exact same thing and once again they were awesome. Sadly, nearly a month later I had issues again. This time the left ear bud suddenly disconnected and went dead. Usually if the battery is low it will tell you so. That didnt happen, it just went deal. It will not charge or turn on. I'm so sad! Now my showers will be dull again.",2,1,2019-8-18,1,0,0
"Earbuds arrived early considering the delay with all non essential Amazon orders so we were off to a good start there.  Upon opening the package I found the earbuds to be high quality and very impressive considering the low price.  They come with easy to understand directions and are sure to be a good fit with the 4 different sized silicone bud shapes.  Pairing the earbuds was basically the same as connecting any other bluetooth accessories, simple and easy.  I use them mostly for listening to audiobooks while I do my household chores and was impressed with the all encompassing audio quality, it sounds like the voice is in your head 😄.  I haven't tested the waterproof claims but I will be trying them out soon in a nice hot bath ☺",5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"First, I have to admit that the seller gives a free wireless charging pad for your review, hence the large number of reviewers.  However, I am reasonably happy with my purchase.  The sound is close to the best I have seen in wireless earbuds, especially at this price point.  They are the clear leader as far a bass is concerned.  I bought these earbuds really for one reason only; to workout in a high-cardio environment where I sweat profusely.  I must say that these earbuds have so far lived up to the challenge.  I do recommend them if you want reasonably good sound, waterproof performance, and a decent price.",5,1,2019-9-14,1,1,0
"I bought three pair of these earbuds for Christmas presents, based on a recommendation from my son, and one I kept for myself.  I was not disappointed!  These are great little earbuds for the price.  The sound quality is great.  They come with different size rubber tips to ensure a good, comfortable fit in your ears.  They are advertised as waterproof, but I've not tested that out yet. When you put the right earbud in, it automatically turns on and pairs with your device.  Then, the left one follows, pairing with the right one. The charging case is great and the earbuds can be recharged several times before needing to charge the case.  I love the freedom of wireless listening.I did encounter a problem with the left one not pairing to the right after about 3 months' use. Since these come with a one year warranty,  I emailed the company and received excellent response communication. Jet tried to help me resolve the problem with directions to reset the earbud, but when that didn't work, he promptly mailed me a replacement left earbud.  I am very pleased with the product and the company's customer service.",5,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0
"I recently purchased a set of Tozo T10s and posted a review indicating that they had great sound and fit but, they lacked certain features like volume control.  I was not dissatisfied but, I wasn't thrilled either.About a week or so after posting that review I received an email from Wendy at Tozo. To my disbelief, she acknowledged my review and offered to provide a set of T6 earbuds or a complete refund. I elected to try the T6 and they arrived within 2 days.  The T6 sound even better than the T10s. The bass is the best I have experienced from a set of earbuds. The fit is outstanding. They offer 6 different size selections which should cover most everyone, even the hard to fit. The best part is that the T6 does offer volume control as well as the ability to pause and start as well as skip forward or back.  My only very minor negative is that the earbuds can be difficult to remove from the charging case. This is so minor that I did not even deduct a star.",5,1,2020-3-24,1,0,0
"These wireless headphones are a dream come true for me. The sound quality is supreme, the comfort level is 10/10, could wear them forever without noticing them in. Again, the sound quality, especially for the price can't be beat. The charger case is legit!, the products are sturdy, non fragile, strong, with great quality, nicely built equipment and materials. I would believe that these were in the 100s of dollars range: that's how pleasantly surprised and super excited when I tried them out for the first time! They are waterproof, mic'd, great for sports/running/sweating, bluetooth and wireless, their own heavy duty charging case with magnetic receptacles for each single ear piece, both R & L. The packaging was stellar and easy as pie to pair with phone/computer/ anything bluetooth, and again, they don't lose signal or connection and there is a instructive woman's voice to guide you heard through the earpieces as to whether you've connected or not, it's a joyful experience overall!

By the way, the batteries in these usually go for about 4-5 hours and take about half a hour to charge (give or take).The only downside is that I recently one of the ear buds, one of the fears that kept from going wireless sooner.

They paired right away, but it was nice to know if they didn't there were instructions for that too. I am still figuring out the ear sizes but am confident that I will find the right size.

"Why would I rate 4 starts on sound, noise cxl, and battery life but overall only 3 stars? Because of DISTANCE. The distance sucks. No other way to say it. I can only go about two rooms away from my phone without losing the signal. I will say it comes right back on without the annoying ""disconnected"" signal most Bluetooths give which is nice. However, the main reason I chose these was b/c of the waterproof feature and being a swimmer. There's no way I will be able to go the pool length if I can't walk thru my house without losing service. I like the look, the fit, the charging case, even the packaging is REALLY nice, but again unless u plan on having phone within a few feet, I'd suggest something else.

"After trying many many different Bluetooth earbuds I have found the best. I love how not only are they Waterproof but the charging case is too(IPX8). The sound is fantastic, better than any wired earbuds I have tried. You also get four different sizes for the rubber tips that hold them in your ears. Pairing with my phone couldn't be simpler. Once paired every time you remove them from the charging case they are paired up by the time you get them in your ears. These replaced a different brand that I received for Christmas. The other pair would turn on and pair to your device soon as they were fully charged. Stupidest thing I ever heard of. Who would want their earbuds to pair to your device while in a case. Not only wasted battery life but also messed with my phone. I would get a call and I could not hear anything and either could the person that called me. They were POPCHOSE so you know what not to purchase. I love my T10 earbuds and highly recommend them to friends, family and everyone.",5,1,2019-1-6,1,0,1

They fit snugly right out of the box, although there were additional earpieces if you needed to make adjustments.  I charged them overnight before using them and they seemed to hold the charge well.  The sound quality was good and the outside noise kept out pretty well.  Now I can watch on my tablet without bothering my husband when he's watching the TV.  Haven't tried pairing it to my phone yet.  Hopefully that will be as easy as pairing to the tablet.",5,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0

My biggest issue is how much the Bluetooth keeps dropping. If I put my phone in my pocket, or in the cup holder of the mower, they continuously cut in and out. Pretty frustrating.Outside of that issue, I’m really impressed by these. It’s been a few months since I’ve had Air Pods (Apple branded); from what I remember sound quality would be a toss up which is better, but these are definitely louder.",3,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0

No one could hear my crunch of chips as I chomped away at my snack on the call. Music was a perfect experience. BUT (there always seems to be one of those) after some time I would notice my phone would not give me sound alerts when getting calls, texts, email, ect. After looking into it more my phone would still be connected to the headphones that were in the charging case, in my purse. Because of this the battery would die much faster than it should.The strange thing about this is I had it in the same situation and it would disconnect and recharge and turn itself off when I put it in the case and about a month after having it I started to notice I needed to charge it, and my phone, a lot more. After talking with a Co-Worker that also got these headphones he let me know he also started to notice this same issue.",4,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0

It seems to charge fully in less than 30 minutes and then only has enough juice for one charging session (with earbuds). Hoping I got a bad set. Keeping my review to three stars currently because I use them at work so it's not super-inconvenient to charge them constantly, but I would very much like to take them when I travel (which I obviously wouldn't be able to do at this stage).

They do fall out a little easier than I'd like when sweating in the gym or doing yoga, but the sound quality is excellent, they are light weight, easy to pair, charge and use! I bought white for me and black for my husband and he feels the same! We've tried swapping the silicon ear pieces to the different sizes that are included, but that didn't change anything or make the slippage better. It's not terrible slippage, but enough to be just a little annoying. Otherwise these would get 5* from us, especially for the price.

"I've been using the Tozo T-10's for about a month now, so I feel like I've used it enough to write a fair review. The sound quality of the ear buds is ok. Nothing terrible or great to say about it, but that's what I was expecting given the low cost compared to some of the name brand wireless earbuds. The bass is pretty weak and some rock music can sound staticky. The biggest issue with the sound is actually how frequently it'll cut in and out. My phone is in my pocket the vast majority of the time, so distance should not be an issue. I never had this issue with another brand of wireless headphones I got on Amazon, so I know it has nothing to do with my phone or the app I'm using. The biggest disappointment though has been the battery life. The battery life of the earbuds themselves is close to what's advertised, given that I probably listen at a volume higher than they tested; however, the battery life of the carrying case is terrible. I charged both earbuds and the case to full and used the earbuds until they were drained. When I put them into the case to charge, it only had 1 charge left...after not having used it once after a full charge. For those of you who are still on the fence, I think it's worth saving up for a bit and buying yourself a more reputable brand of wireless earbuds.",2,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"My expectations weren’t very high considering the price, but I figured since the reviews were really good let me take a chance.  I didn’t want to spend over 100$ anymore on headphones.  Once I got them I was immediately impressed by the packaging and quality of the product.  Once I started to use them I was amazed how great they sound and Bluetooth connectivity was instant.  Everything about theses earbuds impressed me.  The packaging , quality, sound, ease of use, it exceeded my expectations.  I’ve had beats, JBL, Apple and others and these headphones were just as good, but much more less expensive.  I was very impressed with the base sound playing my hip hop and reggaeton music.  They are great for working out.  They stayed in my ears while I did my running and cardio.  I liked my Tozo earbuds so much I recommend it to my family, friends and purchased one for my wife.

"I've never had wireless earbuds before so I was very iffy with purchasing these as I'm used to wires. However, my beloved wires cause some hassle in the gym when I'm jumping around or lifting and this had such good reviews that I figured I might as well try it. I've only had these earbuds for a week or so now but I must say the sound quality is really good and I can get around 4 hours continuous video play.One thing that I want to warn others about is that these can get quite loud even at 50% volume on my phone. I've only been able to go up to around 25% max while wearing these earbuds before it starts hurting my ears from how loud it is. The bass comes out beautifully through these (something I was worried would be compromised without wires) and it does cancel out a lot of noise once you find the right fit.",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0

"I love these headphones! Great sound quality, noise cancellation and battery life. I wear them all the time at home! I also wear them when I mow the lawn and it’s much better than wearing those big earphones.Unfortunately after about 4 months, one of the earbuds stopped working all of a sudden. I used the TOZO guide to do some troubleshooting but it didn’t work. I contacted customer support and they sent me new ones and I just had to send the defective ones in. The only downside to the customer service was response time. I’m not sure what country they’re in but there is apparently a 12 hour time difference...also I feel that their English is not the best, and to me that is somewhat unprofessional.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"These just came today and I used them running.  A couple things.  There is no way on the earbuds to adjust the volume.  I really wish this feature would be added.  Additionally, I needed to change the size of the ear caps and it was kind of a struggle.  The new size didn't want to attach.  Finally got that worked out and am happy with the new size.  I was initially unhappy with the sound quality as it definitely didn't have ""deep bass"".  That issue cleared up as soon as I had the correct size ear caps installed.  This was easy to pair, they are easy to charge (and quick).  It doesn't come with a wireless charging pad so you'll want to get one of those.  The size of the case is fantastic and seems to have a really sturdy construction.  The case charging USB cord is REALLY short so you'll want to maybe use a micro charger with a longer length.  I had a ton of them, so that was pretty easy.  Overall a great purchase and would buy from them again.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"Comes in impressive packaging, charged and ready to connect to device. Comes with selection of ear pieces to semi custom fit . Easily stays in place, though quick movements may dislodge. Sound quality is fair for such a tiny speaker and microphone does an impressive job of noise cancelling. I could be heard without yelling while driving with window down. Dislike - Range from device is not impressive 10- 20 ft. ( My last set went beyond 50ft) Battery life less than 3 hours with constant use.  The unit battery is very tiny afterall. Right channel became intermittent in operation after about a month on both sets purchased with right channel completely failing to connect on one set despite being charged and showing on device as available.  Manuel has a poor English translation but Bluetooth is pretty universal in operation so just press the buttons and so like any other device. Of course none of these are the sellers issue and simply the nature of electronics, mass production, distance and cost. If you don't expect concert sound, on a budget and can deal with an imperfection, buy them. If you want more you'll have to spend a lot more.",3,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0
"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.",5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,1

I can hear the book being read even as I walk along busy streets.  When walking and chatting friends have told me they can hear me very well, as I can hear them.  I have no hesitation in recommending this Tozo product.  I might also add that the company is very responsive when I have reached out to them for any reason.  Well worth a purchase, especially at the price point.",4,1,2020-5-30,1,1,0
"I was looking for Bluetooth pods for biking, but didn’t want to pay AirPod prices. I did a little shopping around on Amazon and the TOZO T10 popped up. I read the reviews, watched a video review and I was sold. Price wise, $39 was right where I wanted to be. There was an additional 20% off plus I had a $9 dollar credit so final price came out in the mid 20’s. Out of the box they paired to my phone signing 20 seconds. The fit is perfect in my ear, plus it comes with a bunch of additional fittings to suit your ear size. Quality feel on pods and the charger base is great, plus it’s wireless charging so I just put it on my wireless charger pad and it started charging. If your thinking about getting these, just do it, well worth the price. Thank you TOZO!",5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"I bought these because Reviews said it didn’t fall out of ears. Sadly, that wasn’t true for me. I must have funny shaped ears because most fall out for me, so I gave 3 stars ⭐️ As maybe it’s just me(I tried the different size bud sponges). Audio sound was mostly really good except it would give fuzzy sound every once In a blue. Could not eat with these on- they fall out.

Long lasting battery life - wish there was a charge optional button on the case , they seem to constantly charge leaving your back up cell depleted if they stay in the case for like a week . And if there were a way to skip songs by tapping one of the buds that would be nice . Those are my only complaints . They work great for music when working , no wires to hang you up , just strap phone on belt buds in and whistle while you work 😉",5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0

Sound is very important to me, and the Tozo buds provide a wide range of tones from bass to treble. Great fit in ear and different sizes of rubber ear inserts are provided. I have had my pair for several months, and have had no issues. I use an IPhone and they are great. If I accidentally lost one or both, it is good to know they would not cost several hundred dollars to replace. One last thing, I do not know how you could improve on the sound quality......It is that good.",5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0

I haven't tried them for phone calls yet, and I'm still trying to figure out how to get my laptop to connect to them so I can use them for Zoom conferencing. I'll post an update once I've done these.",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
"I am looking for an earbud to listen to audiobook, and this is a good pair of earbud for that purpose. I usually listen to audiobook when I am in the lab doing experiment, or when I am traveling on car (note: I use only on of the earbud when driving because in California it is illegal to drive with both earbuds on). I can usually go for hours before needing to charge the earbud on its case. The battery lasts long enough that it is not inconvenient for me to charge them. The only thing I hope can be improved is to be able to leave one earbud in the case when using the other earbud (when I am driving). Currently if I leave one earbud in, the other earbud are automatically turned off. So now I have to just leave one earbud playing in my pocket if I want to use only one earbud. A minor inconvenience, but doesn't affect the overall quality of the earbud. Overall I am satisfied with the earbud :)",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0

"My husband is a musician so he is pretty picky about the quality of earbuds and headphones. I ordered these on a whim for him because he had been talking about getting cordless earbuds and they were on a lightning sale so I thought why not. They had good reviews and were worth trying, if anything we could return them. Received them and he is very impressed, you cannot be the price. He is super happy with them and so am I since now we don’t have to spend twice as much or more on a bigger name brand. :)",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
Update: I received an email from TOZO telling me they would replace my earbuds if i changed my review. They keep sending the same email over and over!  Not once did they mention fixing any of the issues that made me give them 2 stars... review is not changing...The little covers need an extra small size. These don’t stay in my ears. They don’t pair with my phone properly all the time.  Very frustrating. The directions aren’t even directions. They’re pictures with lines. I should’ve just gone with the name brand ones I originally wanted. These are garbage,2,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0

The ear buds sound great and function perfectly.  Love the wireless charging via the Qi pad.Updated: The seller reached out to me and is sending me a new pair of earbuds.  I'm updating to 4 stars for good service.  I'll update when I can test the new ones.  I will test the microphone.,5,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0
This Headset is very impressive. First off it's light and I can barely feel it in my ear. My other headset devices wrapped around my ear and it would get uncomfortable after a while.

"These earbuds are great!! Definitely amazing for the price you pay, and I would have expected them to costs twice as much!! Tons of options for different size ear canals, which makes them quite comfy! The sound quality is decent, I just wish there was a bit more in the low end. I wear them to the gym, and my only gripe is that the left bud cuts out for split seconds at a time here and there.  I imagine it's due to all the other people at the gym wearing bluetooth devices and there may be quite a bit of interference there, but it's not a big deal. Buy them!!

"The first thing you notice about these earbuds is the high quality construction. The instructions are straight forward and easy to follow. Had the earbuds paired with the iPhone very quickly. There were ample options for ear plug sizes to make them fit comfortably and securely, even with jumping around they didn't dislodge. The sound quality is great, but the best part is the noise cancellation which got rid of outside noises.The holder/charger has nice magnetic contacts to take the earbuds which is great.

"I was so excited to get these for my workouts. As soon as I received them I got them all set up, powered them up, etc. The next morning I used them in my workout, but the battery died after only 30 minutes, which was so annoying. I went home and plugged them into a new outlet to recharge. The following morning, the same thing happened: they shut off after only about 30 minutes, saying the battery needed to be recharged. This is even though all four lights showed a full charge on the battery case. So I contacted Amazon yesterday, and they walked me through the process of resetting the earbuds to factory standards. Then I moved them to a third outlet to recharge. I was so hopeful they would be fine! Unfortunately, during this morning's workout they shut off after only 30 minutes. I'm sending them back!",2,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0

"Worked well right out of the box.  No problem pairing it with my TV or phone.  I like the charger base because it Not only lets you know how much battery life is left but it lets you see when the earbud is fully charged.  I’m anxious to see how many times I can charge the earbuds using the case, before I need to charge the base itself.  I also like the fact that the case can either be charged with a USB cable or a charging pad.  I only wish I could adjust the volume in each ear separately as I have some hearing loss in my right ear.",4,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
These earbuds are great. The only reason I returned them was that they had a physical button and not a touch control as the ad says. Be careful if you are looking for touch controls that are not a physical button. Many of the adds say touch control but do not clarify that it is a physical button. I bought several of these that said this only to find out they were equipped with a physical button. The Tozo T6’s are an updated version of this pair and do have actual touch control without a physical button. They are great in every way.,3,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"But damn, these are a legit pair of ear buds. I can't do Air Pods, as much as I wanted to, my huge head and ears just werent a good fit. These things fit perfectly with the large buds attached. Pairing was easy right out of the box. Now, I'm all about sound quality. I love full , clear sound. I primarily listen to EDM and Hip Hop, so bass is very important. These things bump harder in my ear than my GF's Beats Studio 3's. Seriously, she nor I could believe it. I use the spotify app and turn on the equalizer to make some small adjustments to the lows and highs, and they sound even better. Overall for this price, I can't believe the quality. Hopefully these lasts seeing as I've just received them today and have only had one trip to the gym to test drive them. The noise cancelling effect is borderline unsafe. I could not hear my gf talking while sitting directly next to me.",5,1,2019-3-25,1,0,0
okay so i bought the Tozo  T10 and wasn't satisfied as they dropped the music constantly while carrying it in my pocked it would stop working. I sent a review and a nice lady responded that they would send me the upgraded version for free the Tozo T6 as evidently the T10 was probably a bad unit. Well here we are 3 weeks later and the T6 upgraded version stopped working TOTALLY. The don't turn on even with a full charge. So I've lucked out on both units and am back to looking for some quality ear buds without emptying my wallet. To their defense the upgraded T6 worked great till they died.

"So far so great.  The pairing process with my iPhone 11 was simple out of the box and I have successfully used only one earbud (the left one remains in the case for safekeeping).  The out of the box tip was perfect for my ears, but it is nice to have options.  I have a Choetech proximity charger for my iPhone and I was able to successfully use it to charge my earbuds as well.  Sound-wise I primarily listen to non-music (podcasts and books) and it worked well for both of those.  I like the ability to pause the playback from the earbud rather than having to fumble with my phone.  I have not yet used the earbud for a call, but for what I needed these are excellent.  If anything changes I will update.",5,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"Even though I already have the NC9 earbuds, I really like these earbuds, too. One advantage of these is that it has wireless charging so that’s one less charger cord I have to take along when I travel. The other thing I really like is that either bud can fit in either ear. This is handy when I am doing housework while listening to an audiobook, and I still want to be able to hear what’s going on in the house. Also I can go longer without charging,  because when one earbud battery is used up I can switch to the other earbud. These earbuds fit my ear very nicely and are very comfortable for long hours, unlike the annoying hard Apple earbuds. I have been known to take a nap with one in my ear, or even forget it’s still in my ear after a podcast episode finishes.I highly recommend these.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,1

I'm able to listen to my music a whole lot longer without having to charge them.  These earbuds are good if you want a cheaper alternative, and I think they do a better job of canceling out noises if that's important to you.Edit:  Updated to 5 stars purely for their great customer service.

"I was originally going to buy a pair of these for my wife as a present.  She has an iPhone and didn't want the Airpod design.  She wanted something that would not hang down the side of her ear.  But, when I saw these, and read the reviews, I wanted a pair for myself as well.  So, I bought 2 sets.  My only regret was I bought 2 white sets and I would have preferred black for me (my fault).  Okay, back to the review.  First, the packaging is first class!  Beautiful box which contained the charging case, earbuds, bud caps (small, medium, large, extra-large), carrying strap for the charging case, charging cable (for connecting to the charging case and a USB port).  Also included are well-written instructions.  I'm listening to music through them now as I write this review.  I do not yet know the length of usage time before I'll need to recharge.  When I first opened the package, I was first impressed with the way they look - not just the styling, but their claim that these are waterproof.  It's pretty obvious they are (although I haven't tested that feature) as they appear to be a sealed design.  I do know having the correctly-sized earbud caps will affect the sound quality.  Great for them for providing all the choices!  I tried the ones that came installed on them, but felt they were too small for me, so I removed them and put on another set.  After trying a couple different sets (provided), I found the ones that are comfortable and provide quality sound.  I've paired this set of earbuds to my Samsung S8 (Android) phone, as well as my laptop (Dell Precision 7720).  Pairing was SO EASY!  The earbuds first pair with themselves, then wait for you to initiate pairing with a device.  After they pair with themselves, they tell you (in your ear) ""Left earbud paired"", ""Right earbud paired"" - or something like that.  Even though they are labeled on the outside of them with ""L"" and ""R"" for Left and Right, respectively, it's really nice to know that you'll be listening to your music with the proper left and right channels.  Noise reduction / cancelling wasn't tested too much.  However, I can say that it is definitely reduced.  As for music sound, it's crisp and clear.  Bass response is decent.  Getting a good ""seal"" with the earbud caps will provide a better bass response.  I've already purchased 2 sets.  I may purchase another 2 sets.  These are that good!  For those concerned that these are made in China, don't be.  I live in the United States and the instructions were in various languages.  The English section of the manual was excellently written.  The voice, from my earbuds is in English and easy to understand.  To the folks at TOZO store, I thank you!  This is a great product!",5,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"Sound Quality:The sound quality is near perfect, my only real annoyance is that when you pause a video then play it, the sound will temporarily not go through the earphones, it's only about 1 second of sound so it doesn't really affect me, but it can be a little bothersome if you're having to pause and play a video consistently.",4,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0

Call volume and quality is solid, and there were no complaints from the other end of the call.Edit: Ive had to deal with customers service as of late due to a failed charging port on the case of my T6 earbuds, and the customer service has been amazing.

It'll happen several times in quick succession then they'll be fine for a bit only for it to return again later.  But for under $40, you can't expect super quality.

The Bluetooth power was questionable and seemed to cut out if I had my phone in a back pocket, but wasn't able to use them for long enough to really confirm that much as the master headphone wouldn't charge.The seller was quick to respond and offer replacement or refund without even going through the hassle of returning the headphones, so I was willing to give a middling review. But then they made their service contingent on receiving a give star review, which I was unwilling to do given the quality of the product I received. They stopped responding after that and I returned it to Amazon for a refund.",1,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"I've struggled finding comfortable, durable, and reasonably priced earbuds. And I'm still looking. I like these ear buds, but I need a pair I can love because my main need for them is for running and they wont stay in my ears. They're just too heavy. I was wondering about that being an issue, but i figured if it was just lodged in my ear it'll be fine. Nope. My second biggest issue is that the signal is super sensitive. So when I'm running I have to hold my phone instead of keeping it in my pants pocket, which is where I prefer it. I've probably had 5 different pairs of Bluetooth ear buds and this is then first time I've had that problem.I Also think it's weird that the only way to turn them on is by taking them out of the dock. There is a power button on the actual buds, but it only works if you're already using them and press it to turn them off. You can use them to turn them back on but it has to be right away or they will completely shut down. That's weird, right? I think it's weird.",2,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones last week after scouring the website looking for a good product to buy. Normally I like to check 1 star reviews for every product I'm interested in before making a decision. After an inconclusive search, I just chose one within my price range and bough it.. I've tested them out and here's my initial review. If anything changes I will post another review in a few months.First, the headphones do come in a rather nice case. The top of the case is translucent, so you're able to see the light indicators for the battery life and power status of both the headphones and the case itself.",4,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"Maybe I'm spoiled. I've become accustomed to quality in-ears while playing live music. These immediately struck my ear as sounding cheap. I wish it wasn't the case with so many good reviews.I gave this 3 stars for build quality, battery life, aesthetics, and the waterproof feature all being good. Based solely on the sound quality, it would've been more like a 2 star for me.",3,1,2020-8-3,1,0,1
"My dad got these for Christmas one year and I had commandeered them until i decided to get my own. When I got them they worked perfectly, with the ear tips included they sat rather strange in my ear and didn't always get a good seal so I put my own smaller ones on their and they were even better. Noise isolation is amazing, I can walk around the house with my wild siblings and not hear a thing even if I'm listening to a podcast (gaps in sound). Now pairing is fairly simple, they turn on as soon as you take them out of the case and then you connect your device to the master earbuds but the slave is what presented some issues. For the first couple of weeks they paired just fine until my family went on a cruise and for some reason the slave earbud would cut in and out CONSTANTLY. I reset them (instructions in the info slip), and re connected them over and over and they might stay consistent for the length of like one song and then it's back to where I started. In order to get a slightly better connection I have to make sure the slave earbud is in the middle between the master and the device it's connected to and it's more of a hassle than what it's worth. Their pretty water resistant, in the shower is the most intense use they've had and overall sound quality is AMAZING. Spotify has an equalizer feature in the app so once I fiddled around with it some I had some of the best sounding earbuds I've ever tried. There's an abundance of detail no matter the genre you're in too, substantial bass, and the clearest mids and highs. They get plenty of volume at less than 50%, battery life is okay, I can typically go 4 to 5 hours on either both or one earbud (which is what I've been reduced to as of recent). So yeah to summarize, these are great earbuds, like seriously great, my only disappointment was pairing issues but it doesn't really seem like many other people have run into that so I might utilize my warranty and see about getting them fixed. Hope this helps!",4,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"Only been using these recently and had to send back the first pair due to constant connectivity issues. The left ear bud seems to always want to lose connection randomly at times. Been testing to see if it's due to other blue tooth active phones near me. When they're working properly, they sound good for the money. The lows and highs are above average as far as what's expected. I'm still 50/50 on whether I'll send these back if the connectivity issue doesn't stop. Happens at the gym and it's usually 30 minutes into them on a full charge.I will update my review here in a few days to see if anything improves. I'm just as paranoid when it comes to fake postings of product reviews and use different sources to find the false reviews. I can't convince you to trust my review, but I'm trying my best here. This product is not a 5 STAR review rating in my personal opinion. Maybe a 5 Star when it comes $20 ear buds.",3,1,2019-12-25,1,1,0
"I am amazed at the sound quality, comfort, and value of these Bluetooth 5.0 earbuds.I purchased 2 pairs, one for me and the other for my niece.  She wanted a very popular pair that cost way too much. I informed her that without a doubt, there are earbuds with a rechargeable case that sounds just as good if not better and likewise for the look. She didn't believe me until she tried the earbuds that I gifted to her. She loves them as do I.",5,1,2019-12-13,1,1,0
"Before I place my order, I searched on Amazon, and found out this product has decent review and ""amazon choice"". I have to say, the shipping service is great. I got the package and tried to enjoy the music. I tried to pair these earbuds with my music player, then I heard ""second device connected"". That means, these earbuds was connected with some devices before and the volume are super loud!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Be careful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Don't buy this product if you want to protect your ears.  It's ridiculous that the default volume is so loud!!!  Also, the left and right earbuds lost connection occasionally. Have to return it and get my money back.",1,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.",5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"I've used these wireless headphones for a while now and mostly during work. They provide great quality sound comparable to my previous $100+ headphones and have that deep bass that I was searching for. I love the base as you can charge it on your charging base and is waterproof. Overall, its great value for the price and I did not have any issues.Recommendation: Solid buy for the price",5,1,2019-7-27,1,0,0
"Theses are nothing short of AMAZING! Great deep rich bass, crystal clear TWS synchronization. So easy to pair, just pull them out of the case and they will link right up to the last device used (if in range with bluetooth on).I have tried many sets of headphones like these, but they always fell out of my ears. The Tozo earbuds on the other hand (once the right ""buds"" were put on) are a very snug fit. I can walk, jump, or even run, and they stay in place.",5,1,2019-4-9,1,0,0
"I returned this product for a few these cons:* Touch control - for something that is in your ear, you have to press the button way too hard for it respond. I used other in-ear headsets that a light press is all that is needed.",3,1,2019-7-15,1,0,0
"I'm loving my earbuds!!! The color is just like viewed on Amazon. The sound quality is not like stereo quality of Bose but they get the job done. I tested them the ability to cancel out noise. In classroom of 17 rowdy middle school students these  passed the test with flying colors to block out the background noise.Easy to charge, loving the portable charging case that allows you to store as well. I toss them in bag and go. Only used them a day but I'm pleased.  Not sure how long they stay fully charged yet but I'm sure they will do fine.",5,1,2020-2-29,1,0,0
"I was so happy with these the first few weeks I had them. I have a daith piercing so its difficult to find wireless earbuds that actually stay in and dont hurt. After about 2 months however the battery barely lasts 30 minutes. I get the *beep beep* warning and they shut off, even if my phone says they have 50% battery left. UPDATE: after I posted this review, Tozo emailed me stating that I may have gotten a defective pair. They sent me upgraded earbuds for free! Only leaving out one star for the initial experience with the first pair. Great product for the price!",4,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
"Initial pairing took a little longer as it didn't go into pairing mode in the case, but when I removed it from the case it automatically went into it. It also scared me that when I placed the earbuds in the case the case's battery meter went from fully charged to 1 bat within 5 min. I plugged it in and just let it charge for few hours and seem to go ok.The sound and clarity on my end was great. In fact, I had to bring the volume down to minimal to not blast my eardrums. I didn't fool around with the multifunction buttons, but answering the call was fine with one click. I haven't tested the waterproof statement, but overall unit seem pretty tight, and the instruction manual said to not submerge, but can use in showers swimming but not diving, etc. The only issue I'm having with this and it's a big one for me is the call quality received by the other caller. I can hear them, buy they are having hard time hearing me. They've all said that I sound far away and to speak up. I've had to disconnect the earbuds to talk to them, which defeated my purpose of the purchase.",3,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"Overall, I am very impressed with these earbuds. The sound quality is fantastic, with clear, bright highs, and full, deep bass that isn't overpowering or unbalanced. They come with several different sizes of rubber ear pads, which is great for me since the average earbud is just slightly too small for my ear canals.The one thing I wasn't even thinking about, which was quite a pleasant surprise, was the noise cancellation factor. When they arrived at my house, my four boys were playing with three of their friends, and when I put the earbuds in, even without any sound playing from them, it sounded like I was wearing earplugs. Being able to listen to music or movies in louder public areas without having to crank my volume is definitely a big plus for me.",5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"Purchased these for both wireless feature and portability.  The fit is very comfortable. As I learned from reviewing other feedback, take the time to try all the different sizes.  I thought at first that the smaller size fit better until I tried the larger size which sealed much better.  It was very simple to connect these to my iPad or phone.  You have to control the volume from your device but otherwise these are very good earbuds for the price.  Haven’t noticed any significant active noise cancellation beyond the fact that it muffles all of the outside noise just due to the fit.  I liked that I don’t have to worry if I accidentally get these wet.  Will have to see how well they hold up over time but so far I am very happy with this product for the relatively low price (vs. AirPods).",5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
I bought these based on the reviews but they are not worth the money.I needed a pair of bluetooth headphones for my new computer.  After much research and reading tons of reviews on Amazon these came highly recommended. They were very easy to sync but I have never been able to get the left ear to work. I have had them a little over a month and they do not hold a charge of more than 15 minutes and I constantly get disconnected from the bluetooth.,1,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"So the first wireless earbuds I bought were $40 ones on sale at BJ's that were like AirPod knockoffs. Battery life and mic quality sucked. Then I decided to try the Skullcandy Indy earbuds. Battery life was great, but fit was awkward and sound quality was still meh.This product was cheaper than the skullcandy ($40 vs. 50 (on sale from 70) and its BETTER. Battery life in the actual earbuds is SOOO LONG. I swear I can listen to stuff for like 4 hours. Comfort is amazing it has a great seal. I wish I'd have got these first. Highly recommend.",5,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"The sound is ok and it blocks out sound fine, but that means nothing if it can't connect to anything. These ear buds have poor connection with my devices. it stopped connecting to my iPod after one use and it keeps cutting in and out with my phone and laptop when I turn my head or even when I'm doing nothing at all. The sound means nothing if these things can't stay connected to my devices. The battery life is another problem, they only last 2-3 hours which is a problem when I'm out for long periods of time. This has been such a problem  that I have been carrying around a cheap spare headphones that work way better than these earbuds and they were only $16.99. I'm not sure if they are poor quality design or just broken upon arrival but I am vary unsatisfied with my purchase. Don't buy if you can find a better option, which trust me is not too hard.",1,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0

"I love these earbuds. They come with a few different sizes for the silicone pads, and I have to use the smallest ones which fit perfectly in my ears. They cancel out outside noise so well!  Others have complained about having to press an actual button to answer calls or pause music, saying that it jams the earbud into the ear, but I don't find it to be too bad at all. Just hold onto the earbud and it doesn't get pushed into your ear!  The battery life is just as expected. I can use both nonstop for about 4 hours at a time. But I usually just use one at a time so I can go a full work day swapping between them just once. Making calls on them is great. I haven't had any complaints about the person I'm talking to not being able to hear me or any poor quality. The sound is great on my end as well. I have left my phone in one room and gone into others and not lost connection with the earbuds. The only negative I have about these is when I listen to music sometimes the earbud will cut out for about a second or two then go right back to the music. It is a tad annoying but not too bad.

"I have been to big box stores 6 times trying to find the perfect ear buds.  I exercise and I go to nursing school & need a pair of earbuds to accommodate both my needs AND my small ears.  I have tried over the ear headphones, airpods and could not justify the price of Beats.  2 nurses at my job use these and recommended them.  I couldn't be happier.  They come with an assortment of ear caps to fit different size ears and the small ones fit absolutely perfect.  The sound quality is great and they last a long time...I couldn't tell you how long because they have never run out.  I have made it through 3 hours of online lecture, hitting pause and play over and over during the 3 hours and have never had issues.

The case is very durable and feels great, it's not too bulky or heavy or anything. Fits in jacket or pant pockets (not for tight jeans). No active sound cancelling but when they're in it definitely blocks out a lot from the background.Customer service is purely outstanding. My old T10 wore out and would cut in and out no matter the distance of my phone (even right next to the ear buds) I had 2 days left on my warranty and they sent me brand new ones after a quick set of troubleshooting. Now I'm back to working out, homework, and cleaning with awesome portable sound. Definitely a company worth browsing though.",5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"These earbuds cancel out most noise around you, so they may not be safe for outdoor workouts. The sound is good in general and the bass is very noticeable. I did have a couple problems with them disconnecting from my phone and reconnecting right away when the phone is at a certain position, i.e. at a certain angle in a back pocket. Could be annoying if it gets worse, but I like how they fade out and in when disconnecting and reconnecting instead of just abruptly stopping. The smallest sized cushions that came with these were too big for my ears and the buds were falling out no matter how I positioned them. I purchased some extra small memory foam cushions that combat earwax and they were way better. I used these while walking, running, skating, chewing, bending over, and lifting weights. With the correct cushions the earbuds won't fall out and won't need adjusting. I was still able to charge the earbuds with the different cushions on them - they still fit in the charging case.",4,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0

Love i can charge wirlessly on a Qi pad. The sound is fabulous. I love that I am able to swim in these as well. Also beng ableto use only one was an unexpected awesome feature. I'll add info on battery life after more usage. So far I love them enough I purchased another pair and sent a different brand back.",4,1,2019-1-4,1,1,0
"Purchased the T10 earbuds on August 9 and the right earbud stopped working on September 13, three days past the return date. This is not a review of Amazon's return policy but the company who has not acknowledged my issue. I should have paid more attention to the one star reviews and not puchased these earbuds. I do not recommend, the product should have lasted more than 33 days. TOZO does not honor their warranty.",1,1,2020-9-26,1,1,0
"I have had this for a few weeks now. My final thoughts are kinda mixed. First, the quality and material of the earbuds and the case is great quality for the price. It does not feel that cheap. It is sort of plastic but it is nicely done. The earbuds fit nicely in my ears and comes with different sizes of cushion. So far I have had no problems with pairing with my phone and using a bluetooth adapter on a PC. Battery life is pretty accurate but wish it was longer.Now for the bad, not sure if it is just this earbuds but the sound quality sounds bad and flat. The sound quality sounds no different from a cheap knock off product for like 2 bucks. The bass is sub par and nothing too exciting about. As for the microphone, it isn't that great either. It pretty much catches a lot of additional noise in the background. I used it in a meeting while on a computer and people can hear me type with my low-profile keyboard so I had to turn off the earbuds and just use my phone. It is also very prone to static. Walking around with my phone in my pocket, it cuts in out walking on carpet. Then I completely stop and works fine again until I start walking on carpet.",3,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"Lost one after a week. Even with the various sized bud covers, they just aren’t suited to fit the ear. I had to purchase a different brand  and they’re awesome!

Also,  when these ear buds are put in the case they automatically shut off and when they are taken out of the case, they automatically turn on, bonus! Buy Letscom True Wireless Earbuds instead!",3,1,2019-6-5,1,1,0
"Love that the case is a charger itself. The buds are very comfortable. I was worried they were going to fall out since I typically use the smallest size of buds for any typical headphones. Using the smallest buds on these ones, were no problem. I go to the gym and they dont fall out or move. I appreciate it that the case comes with a lanyard and that you can see the charge status through the case cover. The sounds quality is good for the price and quite loud. The bass is deep and sometimes muffled the songs but Im sure it because of the sound settings I have on my phone, which can be tweaked.I only gave it 4 stars because you cant control the volume on the buds themselves, nor skip to the next song. All of this has to be done on the phone. Hopefully they add these features to the next one. But for 50 bucks its not a big deal.  Also, the sound quality when using the buds for a call is not that great but I personally purchased these for the gym.",4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0

"These Tozo T10 headphones are simply the most ideal commuter headphones I have yet to find. Originally, I tried a couple different kinds and styles of headphones (even bone conductor ones like the AfterShokz Aeropex) and I did end up keeping one pair of Shure ones (for sound quality purposes, (which I also just purchased recently in 2019)), but these were my favorite for everyday use. I also currently own a pair of Sennheiser HD 380 PRO (purchased in 2017) that I do enjoy, but are inconvenient for travel. I also previously owned a pair of SONY MDR-XB90EX (purchased back in 2015) where the left ear bud unfortunately failed on me recently so I discarded them. I still got 4 years of use out of them though soooo not the worst thing ever.I've only used the Tozo T10s for about a month so far, but I use them every morning/afternoon during the workweek on my commute into DC to work, which is about 50 mins/each way every day so total (1.4hrs/day). The headphones constantly recharge in the travel case and the charge capacity in the travel case lasts about 3 days with headphones plugged in. Basically all I have to do is charge them in the middle of the week and on the weekends. They stay connected impressively well, signal drops off infrequently (like maybe 4 times so far), but not enough to bother me. I test this periodically too just by stopping the music on my phone to talk to someone and then playing music again. It usually only takes a moment for the headphones to recognize it and pick it back up again.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,1
"This is my first earbud, as I didn't think I would like to use it, but with my long con calls all day long during this home officing time period, I have truly enjoyed.  I have not had one single complaint on the mic sound from any of my call listeners.  I can hear the participants much clearer than with my phone to my ear.  I can even use each earbud by itself if I want.  You're talking $150+ equal technology for a bargain,I just hope they last.  I will let you know if they don't ...for sure.",5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
"These earbuds are superb. I was pleasantly surprised by the clarity, depth, and quality bass that came from them. The battery life is great, at least 2 hours of nonstop playback before you have to recharge them. The included case is basically a power bank for the earbuds. If the case is fully charged, it can be used to recharge the earbuds up to 4 times, plus it acts as a storage case which is convenient and smart. They pair with my phone within seconds of removing them from the case. I have had zero issues with them falling out. They fit good and come with varying sizes of bud covers. I highly recommend getting a pair of these if you want quality sound, solid design, waterproof earbuds, and don't want to break the bank.",5,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0

At maximum volume they were uncomfortably loud (this is not bad, I am just trying to illustrate that they are very powerful). Exactly what I would want from a set of headphones or earbuds. I cannot express enough how happy I am with this purchase. Granted, I have only owned it for today. If anything deviates from what I’ve written in my review, I will update.",5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"The earbuds are very good but after you wear them for a while they begin to hurt my ears.  Maybe it's my ears but that's where I'm at with them.  They are a backup to my apple buds which aren't much better.  Also these earbuds do not automatically switch over to my iphone.  You have to touch on the audio button and touch on the correct button so that's a little of a hassle when answering the phone.Sound is good, price and battery life is long so I would get these as a backup pair for the price and quality.",4,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
"I gave it an overall of ONE because there was no zero.  The product was great for 2 month but started to die in the third. Audio sounded like a magnetic tape on high speed (Donna's duck effect) and today the right ear died completely. No sound, no LEDs, no charging.I would have given 5 stars, if it lasted more than 2 months.",1,1,2020-9-19,1,2,0
"These seemed like decent enough ear buds but they didn't fit me well.  Even trying several of the different size ends they never felt secure.I bought these for riding my bike and I could see them getting lost in short order.  They have fallen out of my ears a few times, mainly the left ear but that's obviously due to my ears being different and not the buds.  This has happened several times walking my dogs and I was able to find them on the ground.",3,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"For a fraction of the price, these earbuds can do almost everything that your fancy airpods and galaxy buds can do. Almost. There are some fancy features that it doesn't have, but you really do get more than what you pay for with these tozo buds. Sound quality is decent. They are no bose, but they sound much better than what you would expect from a $30 pair of wireless buds. They are quite comfortable, and I honestly love the flat surface. I wear these to sleep sometimes, and the flatness keeps it from pressing into my ear, which is really nice for when I occasionally roll onto my side. (It's still a bit bulky, but the flatness makes it 10x better than other brands out there.)If you use the right silicone pieces, it can fit really snugly into your ear, causing decent noise isolation. Not sure if there is an active cancellation feature, but the isolation works fine for me. Can't hear much once they're in. And last but not least, my favorite part of these buds. Wireless charger!! Finally! Someone had the decency to include this in lower-end models. I honestly don't know what the point of wireless buds are if you need to plug in a wire every night to charge them. You've gotten rid of one wire to plug in another one. Makes no sense!",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"Not really satisfied with this product. I expected better sound quality, that said it's not horrible sound quality.They are fairly comfortable to wear, even for hours on end.

Thankfully, i found the left ear pod behind my computer monitor.  Ear pods reunited and it felt so good.

They're also waterproof, which at this price is awesome. Perfect for swimming or Kayaking. Ive ordered about 4 pairs at this point to give as gifts, and everyone seems to share my opinions.

I've only ever paired them with my iPhone 8 (mostly to play Spotify audio).When things are good, sound quality is fine. However, it definitely hiccups every so often. The hiccups are sometimes one headphone makes a ""pop"" noise, sometimes they ""feel"" wrong (maybe both ears are playing the audio for LEFT instead of doing LEFT in left ear and RIGHT in right ear), and sometimes the audio cuts out in one ear for a few seconds.",2,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0

I appreciate their level of customer service.",4,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
"These sound pretty good. But the battery life, at least on my pair, is not good to say the least. Usually goes about 3-4 hours of on and off use with low volume while I take calls at work before saying the battery is low and they near shut off. But the most annoying parts are, you cant just use 1 with out the other or it beeps in your ear non stop until you take the other one out of the charging case and just leave it on the desk or put it in your pocket or something. Also these things have had trouble connecting to devices unless you do it in an order of, taking out both headphones and waiting for them to pair together, then pairing your device.. and the whole time, the things are beeping every 2 seconds until paired. Idk, these are horrible and are a good option for wireless if you don't mind the ""little things"" but I wouldn't buy again.",3,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0

"Initially, these headphones were good, but after about a month they started to turn on without prompt randomly resulting in the battery draining. For instance, I had them on the charger overnight and when I went to use them one day after being unplugged from the wall, the battery is dead. Sometimes I've had to disconnect them 3-5 times within a 10 minute span of being in range with them, but not imitating a connection from my device. They do however have good sound quality, noise cancellation and don't fall out of ears, hence my 2 star rating.  I don't recommend this product.",2,1,2020-5-29,1,1,0
"Wasn't sure I wanted wireless earbuds but thought if I could find a really highly-rated pair at a reasonable price I'd give them a try. Sure enough, I found these and have been very impressed. They paired with each other immediately and with my phone smoothly. As I mostly wanted them for phone calls. I immediately called two people to test them. Both were impressed with the sound quality. The quality of the music reproduction was quite good and a nice bonus. The fit is nice and firm and comfortable using the pads that were attached, there are others in the package for different fits. They are also not too large and unobtrusive.  I bought a second pair for my wife for Christmas.",5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,1
"Ok, first of all from earbuds in general I’m stunned at the sound. My recent favorite songs with heavy bass and twinkly little highs are so good here it’s like I’m hearing it for the first time. And the volume is about halfway!Comparable even to my large over ear Bluetooth headphones! Definitely Better sound than other supposedly waterproof buds I bought from amazon, those did have the plus of being able to use the case as a portable battery like for your phone.

"Just received this earbuds today and super eager to try them out due to all the good reviews on Amazon. These earbuds are surprisingly super good for their prices. My wife has the AirPod 2 and this earbuds sound quality blow the AirPods away.Tip: after you found a fitting sleeve, you can turn the earbuds in circle to either block out the noise or let the noise in. If you choose to let the noise in, the bass is just ok. But if you choose to block out all noise by turning the earbuds up, the bass is awesome !!!",5,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"I wanted to wait before I gave a review. So I've used the buds for about 3 weeks so far.  Pros:  small and fit in ear pretty nicely (I don't jog with them, but I do walk), sturdy (I dropped them before, and no problems), charges quickly, no wires, love carrying case to pop them in to charge. Cons:  No warning they are about to die, battery life is about 3 hours (so if you listen to Audibles/Travel and talk - you'll need 2 pair), wiggles out of ear a little - not a perfect fit (but what is perfect?).Overall, I'm going to stick with them.  They just take some getting used too because I used my prior wireless headset all day before needing a charge.",4,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"First, I want to say their customer service is excellent.  However, their earbuds leave a lot to be desired.  The first pair I received worked marvelously for about a day.  Then they would no longer sync to each other no matter how many times I followed their detailed instructions to re-sync.  I contacted customer service, and they sent me a replacement pair.  This time, they synced just fine AND were discoverable by my computer.  However, if I moved my head, tilted my head back or forward, the sound would become staticky and stop all together.  I tried this with different songs and audio types with the same results.  As long as I held my head perfectly straight and still, they were fine.  Sadly, I cannot recommend them. But again, their customer service people were great to work with.",1,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0

"To start with, these earbuds are super simple to set up and do come with a large variety of silicon tips to help properly fit the headphones themselves. I was up and running within 5 minutes which is awesome, however that's a bit where the pros end with these, unfortunately.Keeping in mind that these are relatively cheap in price, the battery life is more or less 3 hours of listening before needing to pop back into the case for charging. This is a pretty big con in my opinion, and actually had me switching to normal headphones daily. I also couldn't find a silicon tip that didn't hurt my ears or result in them dropping out from being too loose, though that's more of a personal problem than anything.",3,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0

I was also pleased that the latency is very low on these earbuds compa re to other ones I tried in the recent years. All of all, outstanding product. Strongly recommend.

"The battery life seemed good, I only had them for a week but I used them quite often and never had a problem. Sound quality was good when I could get them to properly stay in my ears. I could never be comfortable with them in. They always felt like they were about to fall out. The sound quality always sounded like headphones that were not fully in your ears correctly and needed to be readjusted. When I held them in with my hands, sound was awesome. Noise cancellation was not good since they were never fitted into my ear correctly. And yes I tried the different sized ear pieces extensively. In the end I was disappointed and returned them.",3,1,2019-9-28,1,1,0

LAME!!! I place my phone in my room and can't reach my backyard without the connection going in and out (...my home is NOT a mansion). I wish I realized this before by contacting the seller for details.

"Came with a large case/charger bigger than I thought it would be, well built, great quality, the charge on the case is just as good as they say, good for multiple charges.The earbuds however only last about 3 hours, but I like my music loud with a lot of bass which they probably didn't account for, the sound quality is excellent, comes with multiple size earbuds, I recommend that you use the large ones for the best quality of sound and bass.",4,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"The design of these isn’t the best, AirPods for example has most of the weight hanging down, these however are opposite.

"I wrote the following review for these earbuds shortly before they died completely for no reason. Then, a month after my review, the company contacted me offering me an Amazon gift card for my troubles (at 40% the value of the earbuds) but only if I took down my review. They kept badgering me by email every day or two until I responded, but after five days they still haven't replied to my response. I wouldn't buy these--they don't stand up plus the customer service is wanting to say the least both in their responsiveness but also b/c you can only get help if you hide your true assessment of the product from other Amazon users.These came at a great price, seemed to have pretty decent sound quality, and the battery life was fine (they're my first pair of fully wireless earbuds so I don't have much experience to go off of but I can listen for quite a while before having to charge again). But from the beginning, I found the left earbud often cuts out, especially while I'm in motion (even just walking). Well, I stopped having to worry about that after about two months because now the left earbud rarely works at all. The battery is fine and it's connected--just no audio comes through to it except when it says ""power on"" ""connected"" or ""power off."" Buy something that will work for more than eight weeks.",1,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"I'd like to preface this brief review by stating I was given a new pair of headphones to test by TOZO.These are good headphones for several reasons: they're pretty darn loud, the case carries a really long charge before having to plug back in, you can tell when the charge is done without opening the case, and for those that have fully transitioned to wireless charging, all you have to do is place the case on top of a charging mat.",4,1,2019-5-11,1,0,0

But then, as I came on here to re-order, I decided to read the 1-star reviews, and many had the same issue as me--the left earbud not working. I don't know if it was a pairing issue or what. I just know that, after two weeks, no sound came out of the left earbud. And I read the directions, I know technology, so it's not operator error. Too bad. They were nice while they lasted.",1,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"Good headphones for the money. I'll state that first. And excellent sound quality/noise cancellation for your money too. If you are looking for good earbuds for cheap, get these.

Left and right would pair to the phone (after I gave up on the reset) but left refused to slave to right. Here's what they leave out in the instructions.",4,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0

Have not had a problem making it through a bike ride or a long walk. And as for the sound. These offer really good sound. Good bass a ad clear highs. And the wireless charging is really handy. Never have to worry about having to carry a cord with these. I can use my Samsung gs10 to charge these.Now for the not so good. I ha e not been able how to access google assistant with these. Other headphones have the option to tap the buda 3 times and it brings up assistant. I know these are not google headphones but that is a feature that comes in handy. And as for the button on the side I wish it were touch sensitive not a physical button. There are times that I ha e to hit the button and I feel as off I am jabbing the bud downy ear. Second the connection to my phone is hit or miss. At times it is great. If I have my phone on a counter and I am walking around the house.

"I don't typically consider myself to be a sound junkie, but the quality on these earbuds is embarrassing to say the least. If you're looking to find a ""cheap"" version of Airpods or Pixel Buds or anything else in that genre, this definitely isn't it. Get that out of your head right now.  I think a much better comparison to the audio quality would be the free headphones they hand out on an airplane. That's what you're buying.With that said, the functionality of these is great. They charge reliably, fit reasonably comfortably in your ear (even during strenuous exercise), and the battery life is solid. If that's what you're looking for, and don't care AT ALL about the audio quality, then these would be a decent buy. I think they would serve well to listen to audio books or podcasts, but not music.

"So I received the TOZO T10’s a couple of weeks ago, and I’ve had lots of time to listen to them. The packaging was very solid, as is their construction. I had to do some adjusting to make sure that I had a good fit (this is of course critical with any earbud-type earphones). Once in place, they feel more comfortable than one would expect. The sound is excellent. Note of course that they aren’t flat-graphically equalized, but actually solidly bass-boosted as most music listeners gravitate towards. The bass is quite deep and rich — boosted noticeably near the mid-bass range in particular, and therefore ideal for anyone who loves good, substantial bass. The mid-range is pretty good and the highs are pretty reasonable as well. The maximum volume is substantially louder than any earphones I’ve ever listened to. I’d also say the clarity is pretty good, not perfect, but quite good—the thing to remember is that Bluetooth in general tends to be relatively lacking in clarity when compared to wired earphones. Even though I haven’t listened to every other brand of earphones (though I have heard many) the TOZO T10’s would have to be, by far, the best in their class.",5,1,2019-8-22,1,1,0

I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for wireless earbuds, but don't want to spend 150-200 dollars on them.",5,1,2019-8-10,1,1,0
I'm really impressed with these ear buds. I got a pair for my mom for her birthday and she loved them so much that I got them for myself. The bass is really impressive. I barely have to turn the volume up to hear clear sound and I feel like I'm hearing some intense bass but it's just in my head. Well balanced sound imo.A big selling point for me was noise cancelling and these excel at that. I'm dead to the world with them on. No screaming kids on the airplane. The included charger is really solid. They didn't cut corners. It's got a magnetized lid (not snapped) and the ear bud pop right into place with the magnet. It also comes charged which is really thoughtful.,5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"I only have 3 problems with this, which im okay to deal with since I dont use it too often1. The right ear bud doesn't charge right away when you put it in. You have to take it out and put it back until you see the red charging light.",4,1,2020-6-22,1,0,1

"Finally!! So for the longest time, on my long journey to find what i was looking to call the perfect earbuds, I came across the Tozo’s. Thanks to a co-worker, who has an older version of them, i could not be happier. I’ve tried a pretty good amount of earbuds, headphones, etc, and I think these are probably the best. The sound quality is definitely there, not amazing like beats but these are $40 versus, $100-$300 like the beats so I wasn’t expecting that sound quality, but I only use these earbuds while I’m working so I really don’t need anything with an amazing sound quality. I just wanted something truly wireless, comfortable, good battery, but most importantly, something that didn’t fall out of the ear (AirPods), not that the AirPods would fall out, but they wouldn’t sit inside my ear the way these do, they will always slide out just enough to sit on the outer ear to decrease the sound quality and they will feel like they were ready to fall out of my ear. So needless to say, I took the AirPods right back. All I have to say, is these are definitely worth every single cent. Try them for yourself, you have nothing to lose. I mean come on, it’s amazon, they’ll refund you for anything. I literally just received a call from my sister and she says the sound quality is perfect. She said it didn’t sound like I was using earbuds/headphones. So there you have it.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
"These little buds sound amazing. I wasnt expecting anything out of this world as I just needed something simple for when I work out, but I was super impressed when I played the first song through these little speakers of wonder, Pawn Shop. They were very easy to pair and canceled out everything my two year old was saying as I worked to set them up. Bonus at 730 in the morning on Saturday.  I cant speak for the battery life for these yet, however , I can only imagine they should hold up well to use.",5,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
"these buds are great,great sound more treble than bass though depending on the song listened to.pairing is imediate as soon as you put them in which is fantastic! battery life is good also i have no complaints which is why i bought the insurance that came with it(highly recommend) and it takes calls as crystal clear! this one is a must buy! forget the negative reviews when i shop i look at how many has been ""sold"" that's the key element in amazon guys this is your keeper!",5,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"My very first impression was that the build quality was very nice, especially considering how affordable these earbuds are. They were super easy to set up. They fit snug, no doubt they will stay in my ear during vigorous exercises. Sounds quality is pretty impressive. Nice clarity. Bass is average. A definite buy for anyone who doesn't want so spend and arm and a leg. You won't be disappointed.",5,1,2020-3-6,1,1,0
"This thing just doesn't stick to your ears. The product outside the ears is of absolute quality, but drops every 30 seconds. My feelings are ambiguous: I have to praise the sound quality, the design, the portability, the ease of connection, the price. But if it doesn't stick to your ear, you lose all reason for buying.Bad, bad, bad ergonomics. Even with the little ear protectors, even hurting my ear canal, forcing it in, the body of the headphones is completely out of the shell. This product is not for everyone. Perhaps the solution would be for the manufacturer to design a hook over the ears.",3,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"These are the first wireless earbuds or headphones I've owned. I had been waiting for the SQ to improve and was actually looking for ones that had APTX, but the reviews on these were so good, I decided to try them out. I'm completely happy with them for the price. SQ has far surpassed my expectations. Bass was a little heavy, so I adjusted the bass eq down one notch in my phone and all is good. So glad I didn't pay $200+ for some ""premium"" buds, which would be mostly paying for a brand name. I hope they last, but for now, I highly recommend them for anyone who wants great sound for a great price.",5,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"First off, the plugs do not stay in ears. I am constantly redirecting the ear buds, very aggrivating. Never used them in water so I cannot comment. Now, the crux. The sound is decent. But not up to ""par"" with the coast and description. You can find less expensive ones that sound better on this website. The music sounds blurred. Not defined and way too heavy on the bass. Mid and highs I could never fully grasp. Well, that's it kiddies. I would have returned the darn things but just now seeing I missed the return date, but all, that's on me. But, the impetus for this review. It is ""Fair"" and accurate, with no embellishments. Good luck!",3,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0
These are pretty great. I'm grateful for the various rubber ear replacements (no  idea what they are called). The set that was in the earbuds was way too big for my ears. The sound quality is great. I can also.make calls and be heard without any complaints by the person I'm speaking with. I have recommended that my son purchase  a pair for himself. No volume control on 4he actual earbuds (that I could figure out) but I can adapt to that. Paired easily with my Pixel 2 and my new Note 10 and my Surface Pro.,5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
I have owned the earbuds for about half a year now. I've been using them for 2 hours a day in the gym for around 4-5 days a week. These earbuds are very sweat resistant since I am a big sweaty person. Never had any charging/connectivity issue from them within the gym facility. Connection can fade out if I leave the gym. The price for it is just ridiculous for the quality you get from it. Not to mention the wireless charging it provides!So about a week ago I have been experiencing some charging issues because one of the metal connection is somehow blacked out/blocked? I reached out to Tozo Customer Service and they solved my issue within 2 days. They are going to send me a new pair because mine is still within warranty. Simple and awesome response and solution from their customer service. Would recommend to anyone who are tired of having wires for their earphones when they work out.,5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
"So from what I can gauge about this product it isn’t 100% noise canceling but I’m okay with that. My ears are pretty tiny so I have to use the smallest ear adjustment, and even that I think still feels a bit big. The Bluetooth range is not very far, but that’s okay because I am using this for my phone which is usually on my person. This product lasts about 3 hours on full charge and for my iPhone it takes a bit of effort to connect (forgetting from Bluetooth history and then reconnecting). Overall an okay product.Update:",5,1,2020-3-25,1,0,0
"I purchased these as value earbuds.  I use the for phone calle and audio books mainly, and sometimes music, but I have over the ear headphones for when I really want to listen to music.  These fit me well, and sound good for the price.  There has been a delay or echo a couple of times, like there was interference between the left and the right earbud, so I can’t give them 5 stars, but it was brief and my expectations are not perfection at a value price, so I only knocked off one star.  There were many different sizes of ear canal pieces, and I tried them all on and settled on a good one for me.  I only do light walking and jogging, and have not tried swimming or showering with them on so cannot comment on their waterproof capabilities.The company has had fast service, shipping, and communication.  I am happy with them and would purchase from them again.",4,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
"These wireless ear buds are exactly what I was looking for.  With the interchangeable ear caps I was able to get a perfect fit.  They stay out while at the gym.  I run in these and sweat a lot and haven’t had them slip or disengage at all.  I like that they are water proof as well.  I’ve had much more expensive brands (Bose, apple and beats) that have quit working after a while from working out and sweating.The sound quality is good for me too.  I still get that deep base sound I like.  They are also noise canceling better than other brands I’ve had too.  Overall very pleased.",5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0

"I purchased a set of these earbuds because in the description it said deep bass. I am a musician that plays bass and so it was very important for me to be able to hear the bass. I sent them back because they were not producing the bass that was described, but right before I sent them back, I found out that I was wrong. I was not using the proper size silicone earcaps. Once I put the right ones that fit my ears and put them in properly it was a totally different outcome. I am very picky about headphones and plugs and I can say these are very good. I even purchased another pair for my wife.",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"The best bluetooth wireless earbuds I've ever had so far, i was looking for some discreet earbuds that i can wear @work to listen my music on. The package says the battery last for 4 hours each one, but I used it for 5+ hours before it disconnect (I only used 1 of them because of my type of job). The charging box for them is wireless charging compatible A+ (and I love it). They stay in place and don't hurt your ears. The battery on the charger works pretty well, I just charged it once since I got them 2 days ago (it says it comes full but I just charged them before I use them just in case). I have received calls and I haven't had any issues with interference or people don't understanding  what I'm saying (I work on a warehouse and there's a lot of noise in there). They sound pretty good, the bass doesn't bother at all, the voices are cristal clear. I love them.",5,1,2019-5-20,1,0,0
I bought these because my AirPods broke so I was looking for something inexpensive and these had some really good reviews so I purchased them and tried them out and I was surprisingly amazed by the quality of these earbuds. I really love the sound quality and the I can feel the bass that what I was looking for. The pairing process to my phone was very easy. You pair the right earbud and the left automatically pairs itself. They don’t slip out of my ear a whole lot. I really enjoy these earbuds. I would recommend these to any and everybody!,5,1,2019-1-29,1,1,1
"Sound quality is outstanding for such a small set of ear buds.  I have not tried any of the additional included ear caps as the one initially installed fits perfectly in my ear.  I can go jogging and they do not move in the least!  At a reasonable volume I have been able to get about 5 hours of use on a charge.  Charging the case took about 2 hours, and that's supposed to provide 3-4 charges so that seems perfect!  Noise cancellation is pretty decent, but not as perfect as a true noise cancelling headset, but for what it is, it is VERY GOOD!",5,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
"These headphones served their purpose.  They worked well and were comfortable for the most part. They were more comfortable in one of my ears than the other, which was weird, but they came with different sizes so they could be adjusted.  I liked the case and the indicator lights on it made it really convenient to know when to charge them.  They seemed to be good quality and I had no problem making phone calls with them.  My biggest gripe with these was the sound quality, they sound just okay, not good enough for me to keep, so I am returning them.  I think they are a good buy for people who don't care as much though.",4,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0

"If you're someone who listens for a long time, meaning over 4 hours, don't buy these earbuds. The battery level indication seems to be false, going from a discharge rate of 10-15% per hour for the first three hours to a drop off from 50% down to 20% within an hour. Not to mention you can't enjoy the last bit of battery power because of the repeated annoying bells and tones telling you to recharge. They're comfortable and sound great but why can my other Bluetooth earbuds thay have a wire running between them (not to the phone) can last for 12 hours and are smaller than these.",2,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
Bought these to replace another pair that started to fail after a year. These work OK and the sound is pretty good but they don’t fit my ears very well.The real problem I have is the battery doesn’t last very long even with the charging case. I’ve had issues with them connecting to the charger also resulting in them being on in the case and not realizing it. Also if the battery in the case dies and they are in there they will kick on and try to connect to Bluetooth which ends up in dead headphones when I pull them out of the case and think they should be charged up.,3,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"The Tozo T10 is a truly wireless earbuds with an IPX8 rating.  Excellent sound but it could use improvement in audio mids.  I would love to see longer battery life but the case holds an additional 2 charges--so it works out well.  Unfortunately, the T10 doesn't have noise cancelling functions but I gave it a 2-star because the buds fit nicely in the ear and provides a good barrier for external sound sources.Overall a great product for the price!  I highly recommend it!",4,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"Sound is good, the noise cancellation is excellent, but these suckers fall out continuously!  They are heavy for what they are, and the shape of them make them top-heavy. You cannot exercise with these because too much movement i.e. running will be virtually impossible with these.I purchased these to wear while I work as a dog groomer, and they make it half way through my day before beeping and informing me of low battery every few seconds. I do like that the case charges them well, and can charge them multiple times between charging the case, and I like that it shows how much charge the case has, as well as if the headphones are charging.",3,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"I replaced my old pair of bluetooth headphones that had a connecting wire because they'd fallen apart after 5 years or so, and as much as I wanted the Apple earpods, I don't really care to support them.

"I use these intermittently for music and calls. Sound quality is very nice, and callers have said I sound clear with no difference to speaking through my phone. The case is convenient and has a nice magnetic close that’s strong - I never have to worry about this coming apart in my bag. The battery lasts quite long for me, this last time I used them at least once every day for over a week and I’m only just now charging them to be on the safe side, I’m really happy with how long the battery lasts. And the controls are pretty easy to use when wearing. The only unfortunate part is I’m always adjusting my hair and accidentally bump and pause the song/podcast every so often. Other than that, easy to pause, resume, volume up or down, and switch between songs. Most of the time I only wear one, and it works very well. They stay put nicely if I'm not eating or working out. I’ve mowed my yard with no issues. I would recommend these to my friends as long as they aren’t looking for workout ear buds.",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0

I’ve contacted customer service to see if they can fix it.Update 7/3/2020: once I contacted them, they helped me with the issue quickly by giving me advice on troubleshoot.

"I’m a fleet mechanic for bimbo.  Bought these because I find myself behind the wheel of bread truck a lot.  So I’ve fallen in love with audio books, these are pretty nice for that.  The ear buds last pretty long at least 2 and half hours before needing a charge.  but then the case works as a portable charger and will charge up the buds at least 1.5 more times before having to be charged itself.  Very useful when you can’t always count on being near a wall outlet.  I also use them at the gym, they’re supposed to be water resistant but I can’t say I’ve been ballsy enough to swim with them in my ears.  Sound quality is kinda ‘meh’ and they are poor at noise cancelation.  The trucks I drive are extremely loud, some get as loud as 90 decibels in the cab.  So I have to wear ear muffs over the ear buds in order to hear the buds over the truck.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Just started using them for about a week.  First impression is you have to try the different size ear plugs to get the best fit for you.  The sound is very good.  No volume control.  I use them for running and gym.  They are a bit larger than I thought but fit in the ear well.  I run 3 to 4 miles and sweat and they stayed well in my ears.  Have to adjust to how they feel since there is no wire connection between the two ear pieces and you will have the feeling that they may fall out, so that is what you have to get used too.  Have had very minor sound cutting out.  I am mostly connecting them to a gar in and Tom Tom fitness watch.",4,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0
"So, I've had these a while. I use them when I go for a run. They work great for this. They stay in, and sounds quality is good. But the ""charging case"" is a joke. If I charge the case/buds, unplug them, use them for 45 minutes, then put them back in the case to charge.....I better plug the case in. If I don't, they will be 100% dead, in a few days. It's as tho the case actually drains the ear buds, rather than charging them.",2,1,2020-6-8,1,1,0
"I really like the multiple size choices. I have very small ear canals and it was nice to find ear buds that won't fall out easily. I love that I can exercise (yoga, Palate) and not have anything flopping on my neck. I also like the way the ear buds look...small and not noticeable. So far, so good. Connection is not hard. I love the charging case. Sound is good, but I'm not really picky as long as the sound is clear and consistent. I've been very happy so far.UPDATE : I bought a second pair for my husband and he uses the largest ear buds. It's nice that we can both have a pair that fit us well and work well. Again, so far, so good.",5,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0
"What fantastic earbuds, and at a most reasonable price!  I've tried other earbuds for my gym workouts but none have ever stayed in my rather small ears.  Earlier this week when my Tozo T10 earbuds I went to the gym and got on a running machine equipped with a TV control panel.  The Tozo T10 earbuds paired immediately with the Bluetooth signal from the machine and I watched 2 Netflix episodes of That Seventies Show with thorough enjoyment.

"I got these earphones as replacements for a pair of Bose wired earbuds with microphone.  There were several issues with the unit I replaced, but the main ones were super low volume and oftentimes only one channel worked.  When I put the TOZO earphones on ... WOW!  I couldn't reach the volume buttons fast in enough.  Plenty of volume, clarity, BASS ... I was in heaven.  The only thing that knocked me out of my cloud was that as I was laying down listening, the sound went away ... almost like hitting pause, and then resumed.  I notice the monitor in my wife's MAC came out of sleep at the same time,  This happened several time so I think the MAC was trying to pair with the TOZOs or some such.  Now the MAC is off at night and the fade-outs are less frequent, but there are still some.  That's the only complaint I have and why I give them 4-stars, but for all I know it may not even be the earbud's fault. The case is very stylish and I really like how magnetism is put to good use ... no worries about aligning the contacts, you get the units partway in the hole, and they slip off of your hand into place, nice!",4,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"For the performance at this price point, it is a very good product for the average user.  I am no audiophile and just use these to workout.  It produces well balanced frequencies with decent bass.  My only gripe is fitment and battery duration.  I always have to reposition them in my ears, especially when I'm sweaty.  Battery only lasts 3 hrs.  I'm used to getting 12 hrs out of my old Beats.  Keep your expectations low and you'll be content.Updated 11/21/19.  Down graded from 4 to 2 stars.  I've gone through all size ear pieces and none feel secure.  Still have to constantly push/twist them into my ear every time I workout.  If I twist to deeply,  I end up poking my ear with the sound port.  Giving them away and buying from a more well known brand.",2,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
2nd update:  Tozo customer service worked with me until the issue was resolved despite the fact that I missed the return window through Amazon.  I contacted them directly and they kept constant contact until I was fully satisfied.  Update:  just want to say that the customer service is excellent.  I contacted them with my issues and the quickly resolved them.  Better than most companies by far.  Again the sound quality on music and movies is amazing.  Call quality is a little hollow on the receivers end but nothing you can't get past.  Definitely worth the purchase compared to other more pricey true wireless earbuds.,5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0

I bought this in the hopes that I could get great use out of it i owned the Bose version of these paid like 170 usd for those and they didn't last very long.  I've had this current brand for about 30 days now.",3,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0

I didn't expect much from them because of the price, but I didn't want to pay the premium for the ""fruit company's"" offering but I have to say I'm very happy.  I think they have a fuller sound than the expensive alternative and they're actually pretty good at blocking out noise.  I use these when I'm out on my diesel tractor and I can barely hear the engine.  I'm very happy with this purchase.

The sound is clear, bass is plentiful, and the overall design is user friendly, which is what we all want. The battery life is great as well, because as soon as you put the plugs back in the charger, they charge immediately and I’d say in about 6-10 minutes they are charged back to full capacity.",5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
Pros: Great sound and bass. Easy to pair. Can be charged wirelessly. Charge very fast. It's totally waterproof but it will lose signal if submerged although you shouldn't swim with them anyways but if you're outside and it rains or you drop them in water they should be fine. Case is really nice uses magnets to close and indicates charges left. Works fine even if you are like across the room from your phone. The ones I got are touch activated so it can play or pause songs. I have an android phone and it allows me to use either call audio or media audio or both but you need call audio on for it to display its battery life on the phone. You can also use just one if thats your thing but the right one is the only one that works by itself.Cons: It came with 4 different size pieces for the earbuds but all were too big so I had to use some from an old set of earbuds. It only pairs with one device.,5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0

"I bought this as an upgrade to my soundpeats, which I accidently destroyed. Upon reception, I really liked the design and sound quality, however I started to become frustrated once I began noticing differences between wireless earbuds I normally buy and this. For starters, there is no button to switch tracks, instead, double tapping ""redials"" someone you recently called- leading me to accidently annoy someone I had not meant to call. Then, I noticed that it would often ""disconnect"" and reconnect which is fine except for the fact that it has to remind me every 2-3 minutes while idle with an obnoxious ""BOOP BOOP- DISCONNECTED.... BOOP RIGHT CHANNEL LEFT CHANNEL SECOND DEVICE CONNECTED"". For reference, I am used to either a simple beep letting you know it is connected or a ""Power on... Connected"". This might just be a personal peve, however there 2 other aspects I disliked, one of them being no single earbud mode. It is annoying to take both earbuds out just to have one in your ear and the other one lying around, asking to be lost. If you only take one earbud out of the case, or put one of them in, it will disconnect. I asked customer service if these earbuds have a single earbud mode, they basically told me to ""Lol read the manual"" and sent me a digital manual and did not answer my question which felt insulting, since I had spent 20 minutes looking through my physical copy. ""Thank you for your kind message. Hope the below attachment could help you. We will always be here to support our products"" is the actual message they sent. Finally, I noticed that this product has an overwhelming number of positive reviews, which is why I ended up buying. However, I believe this may be shady, as when I received my earbuds I noticed that there was an option for a 1 year warranty. I tried to register, but one of the requirements is to ""leave a review"" in which I say, how can I leave a review if I just received the product?! It is my suspicion that many of the people here have left blind reviews just for that sweet warranty- but hey, I'm just an amazon guy leaving his opinion somewhere.In Conclusion: The sound quality cannot be scoffed at. Its base packs quite a punch, so no complaints there. Also, I accidently put them in the washing machine and THEY SURVIVED!!!! That is truly impressive. For this, I will make my 3 star review a 4. However, I do believe that there is much room for improvement, see my body paragraph if you want to know why.",4,1,2020-3-29,1,0,0
"Constantly disconnects, sound cuts in and out. Sometimes the right will connect but the left won’t and vice versa. Takes a while to connect when you have an incoming call.I have an iPhone, I don’t know if that makes a difference. I’m returning these and already bought AirPods instead. Much happier with that choice.",1,1,2020-8-8,1,1,0
"Like others have mentioned, Airpods are not for everyone. I was in search of a pair of truly wireless ear buds that fit my ears, and Tozo delivered. These ear buds are have a great form factor; small, but not too small where you lose them. The case is really nice too  – sturdy, easy to open (which was a big one for me) and the magnetic charging pieces are great. For me, personally, these fit perfect in my ear. The sound on these is also incredible. Tons of deep base, great highs, great mids... when they are in, the sounds is amazing. You'd think you're wearing a $200 pair of ear buds. My only issue with these is with movement, such as gym or fitness activity. They sound gets spotty and cuts in and out, which is the problem with almost every ear bud on the market that doesn't utilize the Apple W1 chip for connection. Overall, these are a great value in almost all applications other than aggressive fitness/physical activity.",4,1,2019-7-9,1,1,0
"I was after a new pair of wireless earbuds after my Enacfire v3 buds (which were great) began to decline after over a year of use. I expected these Tozo buds to match the quality since they ran for the same price. Unfortunately, one ear bud copped out on me before I could come to a conclusion.Before I get into the earbud failure, I'll say that these are overall a nice and basic set of earbuds. The presentation is pleasing, with packaging and capsule that were both easy on the eyes. The earbuds themselves are a hair more heavy than the enacfires, but are manageable. As for audio quality, while I wouldn't say it's up to par, it's still acceptable for the price. Not only does it sound distant, but the volume is extremely high on my phone, since only a quarter way up was on the cusp of deafening. I'd also reccomend that if anyone likes using earbuds for late night listening, they avoid this pair. For some reason not explained in the manual (which is sufficient otherwise), the ear buds constantly flash blue and become irksome in a dark room in my opinion. It's not a rapid flash, but it's still a bit irritating, though this might not be a big deal for most.",3,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
***Update***  2020-09-28The seller was very responsive and sent a replacement left earbud. The replacement seems to have corrected the issue. Sound quality is very good at this price.

"I never gave a product a 1 star review. I always practice an attitude of gratitude. Nevertheless, it would be irresponsible and unethical of me not to warn you of the sad truth of this product which is: The connection of the left earpiece is very weak.Before purchasing, I saw a review saying: ""Ignore all the positive reviews"" or something to that effect. Still, I was incredulous.",1,1,2019-8-15,1,1,0
"Sound quality is really bad, even with equalization you can't get anything out of the midrange and mid highs. The T6 and T12 are much better, gave this pair to the kid and he thinks they're great, but discerning ears will tell the sub par sound. I'm surprised Tozo released these with such bad sound quality, their other buds are much better.However, the amp inside is louder than T12, T6, if you like bad techno or electronic pop you too may think these are great.",3,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"I ordered these a few months ago, and at first they were pretty okay, though I felt like the charge didn't last as long as it should, and had some issues with the earbuds disconnecting and reconnecting for no reason, which is a loud and disruptive process. Now, for some reason, the volume is super low on them and can't be turned up, so they are useless. I'm really sad because for me this was more than I usually spend on headphones, and they were supposed to be an upgrade from my old $10 Walmart earbuds, but they are worse and I've gone back to only using the $10 ones.",2,1,2020-9-29,1,0,0

"These are incredible! I have ""really small ears"" and it's really hard to find earbuds that will work but these are perfect! The sound deafening works impressively well, I have worn them to the gym, while walking my dog (I only wore 1) & to the grocery store and it was perfect! The sound quality was impressive. What a great buy, plus the storage box is magnetic which makes it much easier to store. I have received so many compliments!

"Great sound and fantastic price.  Best earbuds out on the market .  I am so glad that i bought these and didnt put out the $169 for the apple earbuds as i originally planned.  Only one thing bad about them, i let my wife use them once and she kept them.  I have to buy another pair.  Great base.....you wont be sorry...Follow up review, 1 month update:  the earbuds are absolutely out of this world, when i can pry them out of my wifes ears.  Wear them at gym and they never even move, great sound.  Company contacted me by email and informed me they were going to send me a free tozo wireless charger.  Just got it and it is a quality product, works great and is free.  The only drawback is that the company is in china and it takes 2-4 weeks to arrive.  BUT LET ME TELL YOU IT IS WELL WORTH THE WAIT!  PRICE IS GREAT!  Hannah the lady i dealt with through email, was top notch and very courteous.  1/3 of the price of apples ear buds, and just as good if not better....⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,1,2019-2-20,1,0,0
"I usually shop around more for something, and this is why I should have shopped around more. These were my first Bluetooth earbuds, so I was kinda eager to find something so well reviewed for the price. But, not realizing these to be an older model, and that better are available for just a little more money, I wouldn't have purchased these.I also don't like how it artificially boosts the bass, which drowns out the sound from my music making it sound like I'm listening to it underwater. I have to reduce the bass on my phone for anything to sound right.",2,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
Happy with these headphones. Sound quality is near perfect. Good bass for a earpiece of its size. Although it has a mic and can answer/hang up calls/redial last call it lacks skip/previous song and volume control. Battery life also is supposed to only last 3 hours on a full charge which I was hoping would be a little longer but the charging case provides 4 charges which is nice. Easy to sync and use and comfortable enough for someone who was never a fan of in ear headphones.,4,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"These are my first set of BT wireless earbuds, and I really love them.  I typically use them for going to the gym.  I have yet to use them for anything else, but I'm excited to test them out for talking with my phone and whatever else I can think of.  The only thing I can barely complain about is the noise cancellation, but maybe it's the volume of the gym and their music.  I am usually adjusting the earbuds (not often) to make sure they are in nice and snug, but I think that's just a nervous habit because these are new to me.  In any case, I would recommend these to anyone.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0

I tried all the different size things and even ones from other headphones with no luck. I actually lost the right one while on the riding mower but I turned the mower off and the volume up and found it under the grass. I tried to just use the left and put the right in my bra didnt work, the music just kept cutting in and out like it lost the signal from the right one.

I've never owned a pair of wireless earbuds (had to get rid of wires because my cat chewed through three of my other wired earbuds) so this is my first foray into that jungle but so far I'm completely satisfied. Also, the charging case is definitely one of the major highlights for this product.As for customer service, they seem to care about the customer's satisfaction.

I did not have any problems hearing him & know what he was saying.

"My first use of these was not what I had hoped for.  BUT I had failed to pair the right earbud, only did the left.  This led me to failures which disappeared when I reset both and paired the right earbud.  The left does not need pairing since it is already known by the right.Sound quality is outstanding.  I have listened to classical, jazz, and gospel and all sound really good.  I will mostly use them for talk and news stations on the Internet but for music as well they cannot be beaten.  I think they may be even better than my wired Sennheiser headset.  That would be amazing.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"You get what you pay for here. They’re solid as far as cheap earbuds go, but they’re a far cry from the brand name ones. Sound quality is just average, the microphone has a hard time picking up your voice on phone calls, and battery life is pretty disappointing. I can usually only get 3-5 hours on a full charge, and the charging case seems to lose battery very quickly when charging. I’ve had these for ~6 months and can get barely 2 full charges when the case is fully charged. Not to mention the case doesn’t charge the buds if it’s plugged in, so if your case is out of battery you have to charge it first, and then the earbuds.",3,1,2020-7-29,1,1,0
"So far so good. I just got these but the sound quality is primo. The fit is alright. Hoping to try the t6 series as they look a bit smaller and these t10s are a bit large for my ear shape but not uncomfortable at all. The battery straight out the box has lasted 4 hours so far. Noise cancelation is reliant upon fit, but the tips come in 4 sizes which is good for me since my ears are a bit petite.Oh! And the charge case is very nice. I also like that I don't have to have the case with me for them to work.",5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0

Easy to pair. I like that it uses words and not beeps and chimes I have to remember which means which.  They seem to be very responsive to connect with each other and the phone.  The sound is very good. I bought them because they are waterproof and I enjoy audiobooks in the hot tub but my neighbors may not. I can’t wait to try them tonight. I don’t get my head wet in the hot tub so these will not be going really in the water or under water. Just near water.  But it’s going to be great!,4,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"I used them just once because the charging case came defective and didnt charge the earbuds. So I returned them and amazon refunded me. I listened to music with them, the audio quality  was fantastic.  I used them while working out and they stayed in place.  Couple of days after I returned them the company contacted me and apologized for the inconvenience and sent me a new set of earbuds (different ones).

They come with 4 sizes of ear pieces for more custom fitting, and an 18 month manufacturer warranty. I have not tested waterproof abilities yet. My husband bought these and I liked them so much I bought myself some as well. You can also pair them separately to different devices.

They range from Bose to Audeze.  These buds were a very pleasant surprise.  The highs and the mids come in well but get a touch distorted on high volume, the bass is MUCH more punchy and pronounced then I was expecting.  Not an joke to say these certainly felt better than my beats buds.  Picked up lows fairly well too.  I do wish they got a bit louder but most will be more than satisfied.  Phone calls come in crisp and clear and no one has complained about  me sounding funny or not hearing me well.  Able to use just one bud if need be, but it has to be the right one if you decide to leave on in the case.

"I have never once written a product review but I could not pass up this opportunity to call out what has to be the BEST waterproof earbuds made.My story starts out with my 11 year old asking for new Bluetooth earbuds for his birthday as he has lost the right “bud” of his current set....therefore only ever hearing the left side of everything.  He still only has a left earbud but now i am getting ahead of myself. I decided to purchase these TOZO earbuds because the reviews seemed positive and they seemed like a good value for the money.  None of these reviews mentioned the waterproof feature and little did I know how important that would be.  This all brings us to the situation that happened last night where we had the perfect opportunity to test the waterproofing of these TOZO Bluetooth earbuds.  My son, with both earbuds in, gets up from the sofa and heads to the bathroom, phone in hand.  I say “hey leave the electronics out here”, which of course he did not hear, as he now has a right and left earbud in place.  Next thing I know he comes out of the bathroom looking all around the floor in the hall.  He tells me that an earbud, the right one of course, has fallen out and he can’t find it anywhere inside the bathroom so I must have rolled under the door and must be in the hall.  Since it is not in the hall, I tell him it HAS to be in the bathroom because I mean, it’s a small half bath and how many places could it have really fallen?  He puts his left earbud back in the case and we start looking. We searched the entire bathroom, two of us crammed into a very small space, unforgiving of the fact that my son has spent the last 15 mins sitting in here. No earbud.  At the same time we both look at each other... then at the toilet.  There is only one place we haven’t looked, and he has already flushed.  He says “NO!  NOOOOO. No way mom.  I woulda felt the splash!”  I say “well, there is no other place we have looked everywhere else!”  By this time we have spiked my other two children’s interest and they too are in the bathroom searching with us.  There is only one answer.  Then, my son looks at his phone and says “OMG!!!!!  The right one is still connected!!!!!”  Me and my older two all shout in unison “OMG!  Turn up your music!!!”  Then “shhhh shhhhh shhhhh!  EVERYONE SHUT UP!!!!!!”  Remember there are now 4 of us in this Odiferous Half bath....  And that’s when we hear it.  The faint rhythmic sound of “Blood Pollution”, yes my 12 year old was listening to a song by a fake hair band created for the cult classic movie “Rock Star”.  We all look at each other and I say “no?!  No way?!  No way could they still be connected and playing in the pipes full of water!”  It’s now been At least 25-30 mins since the bud has gone missing. And my son was SITTING in the bathroom prior to that.  We all lean down a little closer... the music grows louder. My son hugs the toilet as if he drank last nights birthday away like it was his 21st!

They were super easy to pair. They fit perfectly in my ears and were very comfortable. The sound quality is great for what I use them for. The optional wireless charging capability just shows real thought was put in the design of these earbuds. I would definitely recommend a pair or two of these to anyone; the price is more than reasonable for the quality you get.",5,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0

"I use these every day at work for listening to music. They're good at blocking out background noise, it's great that I can use one at a time, the batteries last long enough when I charge them during my breaks and lunch, and they sound pretty darn good for the price.BUT it seems it's a luck of the draw situation as to what ""version"" you get. My brother and I bought these a month apart from the same link on Amazon, and aside from having chosen different colors, they appear they're supposed to be identical devices, with nothing on the package, Amazon, or the TOZO site saying otherwise. For some reason, my earbuds have a button on them used for pausing your music, or answering phone calls/ redialing the last phone number, and his have touch controls (no actual button) that allow him to change songs, or adjust the volume, etc. This is extremely disappointing for me being that I use them daily for music, and having those capabilities would be very helpful. After reading through a lot of reviews and the ""questions and answers"" on Amazon, there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to which type you end up with. I would love to have the other version, but I wouldn't take my chances at reordering them and just hoping that's what I end up with.",2,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"Hubby lost his AirPods so I went searching for something new but less pricey. These were just 1/3 the price with over 20k reviews and the same star rating as AirPods so we have them a try.Luckily I read through the reviews to find out that you need to adjust the EQ on your phone to get a good sound quality, otherwise I would have tossed them. Of course the iPhone is set up to play well with AirPods and not with these so go adjust your EQ before you take these anywhere and you’ll be happy.",4,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
Worked great with big exceptions.1) kept losing Bluetooth connection when I had my phone in my pocket just walking at a normal pace. So I kept hearing over and over the little beeps it makes when it loses connection and also when it reconnects.,3,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0
"Cons: Connection drops all the time. Listening to music is okay at the gym, but they cut out too much to get a good rating. Talking on them is useless because they lose connection and even when they work I have to raise my voice to be heard. Tried to use them during a walk and ended up having to shout until I just took them out and went back to using my phone normally.Pros: These hold charge well, and the charging case charges them fast. Fairly comfortable. Wireless so good for the gym (when they work).",2,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"I have tried so so many of these earbuds. I went through maybe 5-6 attempts at finding a good, reliable true wireless earbud combo for a while, but they all were patchy or flawed. I gave up for a bit, figuring the technology just had to catch up. Now it has!This is the first quality pair of true wireless earbuds I have come across, and at a fraction of the cost of airpods! They connect incredibly easily--they come with instructions, but honestly any average user won't even need them. They are sleek, barely sticking out of your ear. They have pretty decent sound quality too! If you're an audiophile, you may notice slight muddiness in the sound, but for a pair of wireless earbuds these are top notch for the size and cost. The noise cancelling is surprisingly good! And the included size adjustment cups are a great way to ensure that.",5,1,2019-4-4,1,0,0

"This is by far the worst pair of headphones I have owned. Top to bottom, this is a failure.Case Design - The charging port on the back of the case is nearly impossible to open. Everytime I need to charge it I have to find a key or thin metal object to pry open the seal.",1,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"Great so far! I wanted some “truly wireless” headphone and I didn’t want to spend a lot. I’m usually pretty picky about sound quality and for the price, I didn’t expect much for these. To my pleasant surprise, they’re great. They have a nice full, clear sound and they are way more comfortable than the hard plastic alternatives. They pair easily and quickly and the case is well designed. I’d love to get a little more batter my life, but it’s really not bad especially when you consider price and ease of charging.",5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"Just the headline says, the sound is pretty decent - though a bit bass heavy - and they are definitely affordable, but the Bluetooth connectivity is pretty crap. I use this to listen to music/podcasts while going for walks and one ear bud continuously loses connection to the other earbud every 20 or 30 seconds for about a half of a second. So it is constantly cutting out and then fades back in. I've forgotten the device and repaired them numerous times with no success and I've tried switching my phone and armband to the right arm since the right earbud is the primary bud but that didn't fix it.",3,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
"So I purchased two sets of earbuds from this vendor.  I received them very fast, just in time for Christmas.Four months into using them and enjoying them the left earbud went 'dead'.  I contacted this vendor through Amazon explaining the situation and asking if I could have a replacement for simply the left pod and had an immediate response from a very helpful CS agent asking absolutely no further questions and informing me that I would be receiving, at no charge, a full replacement.  I was certainly not expecting nor demanding this but was pleasingly grateful.",5,1,2020-6-25,1,1,0
"I never thought this headphones will be that good! I previously bought another brand here in Amazon for the same prize range,but that was trash compared to this one. The sound quality amazed me the most, sounds like my Bose headphones from before. I highly recommend this one! And i do not really write reviews for products, but this one really deserves 5 star, even 10! I will highly recommend this to friends and family. ♥️",5,1,2019-9-1,1,2,0
"The sound is good but inconsistent ! They are comfortable and stay securely in your ears.I really like the charging box. I bought the white so that I can see the lights through the closed box. I'm not as happy with this purchase as I was originally. They work best if you sit still and don't try to move around. Sound will cut out from time to time. It only cuts out briefly but still, it can be pretty irritating. For instance, if you have your ipod or phone in your pocket and you lift your leg, the sound will sometimes cut out for half a second or so. I may just have to go back to corded headphones or a different brand of buds.",3,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0
"I thought they would charge with USB-C, and unfortunately it was micro-USB port.  White color is very cute and I liked the bright indicator lights on both the case and earbuds.PROS: bright indicator lights; good sound quality; secure, snug fit into ears, decent battery life",4,1,2020-9-8,1,0,1
"*UPDATE* 6 months later using them fairly frequent. Very particular connection needed to get both earbuds to pair together. Reconnecting the right earbud should turn them off but it’s about 65% of the time. Doesn’t always turn off so my phone will be stuck in connection to the earbud. Now I noticed corrosion in the case. Other than that, still a good product. You get what you pay for with the $50.I think this product is awesome and exceeded my expectations. Set up/pairing was easy, the multiple ear plug sizes are useful, looks great and doesn’t fall out. Wore them in the shower and for multiple workouts. Still solid. Only reason I don’t give it 5 stars is that sometimes the connection can be spotty randomly but overall great purchase. Cheap and gives you the best bang for your buck.",4,1,2019-3-19,1,0,0
"Update ... Amazon replaced the first set  of earbuds after I reported the problem below (never heard back from TOZO) and now the 2nd pair are going crazy when I place them on the charger, therefore I’m reducing my rating to 2 stars.These earbuds replaced a pair of wired bluetooth buds and they are a nice upgrade. They stay in while running nicely and have performed well in that respect now for over two weeks. I'm having trouble with the charging system. They are supposed to turn on when you remove them from the charging box - they don't. Also, when I place them in the box and on a charger, they turn on and off, pair and unpair repeatedly. I have sent TOZO 2 emails and have not received a response.",2,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"These are amazing earbuds. I have used many different types. A tad big but the sound quality is insane. The charging case is very handy and works very well. A lot of the time I only use the right side one so I can hear what's going on around me. With both in it is nearly impossible to hear around you. Comes with 4 different sized rubbers for different sized ear holes. I will add that I use with my android device and there are different Bluetooth settings that will makes these earbuds sound even better. You will need to activate developer mode to access some of these settings if the volume level is too low once you initially sync. Great value, highly recommend.",5,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"Ohh Man, this is the best wireless earbuds one can find for less than 50 bucks.. truly impressed with the quality and the sound output.. forget all expensive earbuds and go for this.. you will never find better than this even though you spend more bucks... It's truly waterproof. Only thing I have not tested the calling feature supported by it. Just close your eyes and buy this. The sound quality is superb at low volume as well as high volume.

"I purchased these after my $20 mpow headphones stopped working (after at least 2 years of daily use).  I was excited to have a pair of ear buds and these reviews were good so I spent the $50 and got these.  I have headphones in all night after I fall to sleep to an approximate one hour of playing podcasts while sleeping. I will say the sound with these is very good but they apparently don't power off on their own and I was startled awake with a ""Battery low"" message in the morning.  That's not going to work for me. I need a longer battery or they need to program them to go off after a period of non use to conserve the battery.",2,1,2019-7-12,1,0,0
"I was skeptical at first when comparing prices of this to the ""Top of the line"" earbuds everyone talks about but after seeing so many good reviews i decided to grab a pair when i saw them on a sale. Boy am I glad I did because this has been one of the best pairs of earbuds I've ever owned. The sound quality is amazing, These bad boys last for ages, And the noise cancellation is surprisingly nice. The amount of bass that come out of these is honestly quite surprising for their size as well. If i were to find any nitpicks I'd say that the fact that if you lose the right earbud you can't use the pair (The right earbud is the one that actually connects via Bluetooth.) But this isn't a big issue so long as you don't lose it. Overall I'd say that if you're in the market for a pair of wireless earbuds definitely give these a look especially if you can find them on a sale.",5,1,2019-11-7,1,1,0
"Great sound for the price, and I love the wireless charging ability. However I have to do k 1 star off for the audio delay, it's quite noticable and bad. The earbuds do not have APTX so they have a noticable delay in audio.Update: Knocked down to two stars for the god awful button controls. One click plays/pauses which is normal, but two click redials for some odd reason. I have never in my life wanted a button to redial the last person that I called. No way to unmap the feature on the phone side either, as the earbuds themselves send the command to redial. Due to this and the audio delay mentioned previously, I am returning and picking up some earbuds with sensible controls and latency. I appreciate the wireless charging, but there are too many downsides to this product in my opinion",2,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
These headphones are great! Each earbud lasts about 4 hours straight for me and I almost constantly have them in. They charge very quickly and with the charging bit I can easily listen to them at work constantly for two days without charging the whole thing. I work 12 hour shifts so that's at least 24 hours of constant listening. I can even have them in while I shower! The right side paired without me having to do anything but turn them on. The left side I had to pair myself but it was easy enough.,5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"I had not had any previous experience with wireless earbuds before but wanted to try a pair with all my colleagues in the office starting to use them.  I had seen a lot of people using the Apple brand, but I really wanted something that sealed off in my ear more, quieted my surroundings, and could also be used exercising, etc.  I knew that Apple would not do that for me.  I also knew the Apple brand was overpriced.  I did some research and ending up buying the TOZO T10, even though I initially didn't recognize the brand name.  I liked the design and the reviews seemed positive.I have now had the T10's for about a week and after figuring out how to charge, pair, and use them, I think they are great.  I was really impressed from the start with the packaging and the overall fit and finish of the product right when I received it.  The earbuds themselves are great quality and the charging case is also really good quality.  The case is a battery and charges the earbuds even when the case is not plugged in.  You do have to charge the case periodically, but it works really, really well.  I really like it.  There is attention to detail in the construction, for example the case has a top that is magnetic and closes tightly.  The earbuds also magnetically snap into the case for accurate connection when charging.  The lights on the earbuds and case show (1) when the earbuds are charging and when they are done and (2) how much charge the case has left.  Overall, a very quality product.  I cannot state that enough.  As far as using the earbuds, I had no issues with them pairing with my IPhone the first time and now they automatically pair with each other and with my IPhone when I remove them from the case.  Basically, removing them from the case turns them on and placing them in the case turns them off.  Again, really smart design.  Finally, I have found the quality of the sound is good.  I have listened mostly to podcasts up to this point, but the music I have listened to has been clear and met all my expectations.",5,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0
"I love this product but after a few months or so I had trouble pairing both earbuds at the same time.  Either the left or the right wouldplay but they wouldn't play at the same time.  It was past the 30 day window for return.  My wife eventually reached out to the company to trouble shoot the issue.  Tozo was quick to respond and when it was determined they would not pair correctly, they sent out a new pair.  The new pair is working like a dream.  They have great sound, fit good in my ears and are super convenient to charge and store.",4,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0
"After a little over 4 months, these headphones are still going strong! Although, there is a slight problem (which is addressed in the newer models) which is: the charging case is a tad large. That’s the only problem I have. The sound quality is absolutely amazing, and they get extremely loud. In quiet environments I typically have the volume to the lowest level — and if you really want to lose your hearing... crank that volume all the way up! The bass and clarity of the headphones is very prominent. The battery life is pretty decent, about 4 - 4.5 hours of constant usage, but in newer models of Tozo’s headphones they have increased the life (as much as double!). Best of all, the price! These are great “starter” wireless earbuds, and I’m planning on upgrading to the NC9’s.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
This is the first pair of earbuds I have purchased and happy with my decision.Pairing with my LG G4 is always fast and easy.  The sound is exactly what I was looking for.  Charging is quick and easy with the provided USB charger as well as the wireless charging capabilities.  With the 3 different size ear pieces along with the ones that are on the ear buds already you have 4 different sizes so finding the right size for your ears should not be a problem.,5,1,2019-5-8,1,0,1
"Overall, they are what I would expect for the price.The devices are much bigger and weigh more than I expected.  They fall out of my ears if I move around at all (or even while eating), so they would not work for me while working out or running.  I use them while I work, sitting still at a desk all day, so they work fine for that purpose.",3,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"Overall I have been happy with these earbuds for the price I paid. I wear them mostly when walking and listening to podcasts and it's nice to be able to talk on the phone without a cord dangling around my neck.

"THESE. ARE. AMAZING!!!!!!If you need headphones, please get these. The quality is really quite great. Ease of use is fantastic. Noise cancellation is great. So so excited about these headphones.

The mids, highs are great and the bass is no joke on these. Overall I’d give these a 9 of 10, for the lack of usb-c. I would’ve also like to have seen the Tozo name across the charging case,  instead of nothing at all. Anyone contemplating about these, trust me you won’t be disappointed.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,1,0

"I have 2 pair. They both sound really good and fit well.

The battery life is about 3 hours as advertised and I can usually get 2-3 full charges out of the case. The most useful feature by far is the fact that you can use one headphone at a time as it doubles the battery life. Whenever one bud is low I swap it out for the other one.

These ear buds are very comfortable and snug. I have very small ears so I usually have a hard time with ear buds staying in place. I jumped up and down and they would not budge. Also the sound quality is excellent. Loud without a lot of bass that can hurt your hearing. Even with the volume on low the outside noise is canceled out almost completely. I would recommend this purchase.Updated review; when I go for walks I like to listen to music. The sound cuts on and off and it’s so annoying!

"I've been using these earbuds for the last year. I've finally had it and I threw them in the trash today. They don't work consistently enough to be worth the hassle. Sometimes they connect when I don't want them to. Sometimes, when I want them to connect, it will take a good 10 minutes for the earbuds to connect to my phone. Often times, I'll finish up listening to something and the earbuds will stay connected, and after a time when I try to listen to something new, they won't produce sound.  That's not to mention the countless times they fall out of my ear (and yes, I've tried all silicone ear piece fittings). So, in the trash they went.

They also do a great job with noise reduction if my family is listening to something or playing a video game and I need to block out the noise because of a headache.

I listen to audiobooks mostly, and the lowest volume is perfect, so I get about 4 hrs out of one charge. I’m no audiophile, but music sounds great too. I work in a noisy environment and while these are not noise cancelling, they do a good job of muting that noise, allowing me to listen to my entertainment of choice at a low volume.Setup was super easy on my iPhone 6 Plus. It finds them automatically now when I take the buds out of the charger (unless you’ve turned your Bluetooth on and off, then you have to pair them again).

We were both satisfied but noted that the sound quality isn't there compared to over-ear headphones, but I think it's about as close as we're gonna get until they manage to make the electronics even smaller.These earbuds feel like they're built with quality. They feel solid and have the heft you associate with quality built products. They come with 4 sizes of ear pieces which I greatly appreciated since one of my ear canals is bigger than the other. My earbuds also came with a little leaflet to register them within 14 days to get their 1 year warranty. REMEMBER TO DO THIS! It's well worth the minute it takes especially since other earbud brands have warranties that end after only 90 days.",5,1,2019-8-27,1,0,0

No worries when lounging in the pool or getting caught in the rain. Totally satisfied with my purchase.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"God awful. They cant hold a connection, so they unsync and sync repeatedly. They fall out of my ears a lot despite trying various angles of them being in there. They shut off randomly, which confuses my laptop audio software and then my gaming sounds end up blasting everyone around me. The mic has a hard time catching your voice at the start of your calls, and the overall sound quality is worse than the cheapest pair of Walmart headphones. Definitely would not recommend to anyone.",1,1,2019-5-6,1,1,0
I am so glad someone mentioned these on Facebook to me. I didn't want to purchase a competitors earbuds for $100+ and I also have a horrible time with those others fitting with the hard earbud so these are great. They have multiple earbud attachments to adjust the size which is great too because most things hurt my ears after a short time of wearing them. These where much better. They also stay in place well. I don't worry that they will fall out easily or anything. If you are looking for some good earbuds and don't want to spend a crazy amount for practically the same thing then go with these.,5,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
Yup these are as good as all the review say.  If you own higher end earbuds you will be very pleased on how good these sound for how little these cost.  Great packaging.  Solid case with magnetic closure and wireless charging for the case!  Highs are slightly off and bass is good but not insane.  Plenty for the average person but it's fine for everyday use.Moral of the story.  I'd pay 50 or 60 for these easy and they are under 40 bucks!,5,1,2019-1-21,1,0,0
I can’t begin to grasp how anyone could be stupid enough to pay 150$ plus for wireless earbuds! I just got these in and I gotta say they are flat out awesome! Sound quality is crisp you hear everything and just the correct amount of bass. For the money I’ve never heard a better pair an as far as distance it can connect well I walked all over my house without a single hiccup! Like I stated an the start of this review they are great! I was a little at first hesitant but that’s anyone when delving into a new brand right?  In short all my reservations are gone! I love the case the simple connection makes it easy for anyone to use them with confidence. The only draw back it has and I don’t really consider it to be one as for most of the time you keep your device pretty close I know I do! And I’m certain the creators had to hash that out as well. It basically has no independent volume control meaning you must use the device it’s connected to in order to make volume adjustments’ I say pick a good volume and roll with it you certainly won’t be disappointed! Keep in mind I write extremely few reviews but this product Deserves my time. Now my daughter wants a pair go figure lol. Finally a good pair of quality wireless earbuds that actually feel good in ears looks good and sounds sweet so Thanks amazon and thanks TOZO. Just don’t look any further ppl this is what your looking for.,5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"LOVE these earbuds!  The sound quality is great and bass is awesome - It seems very well made.  Pairs easily to my iPhone and Apple Watch and can pair to my husband’s android phone too (actually bought 2 pairs of earbuds). We use them mostly for exercising and running on our treadmill,- hasn’t fallen out of our ears, yet, even when sweating. I also like wearing them when I do dishes or vacuuming. We changed the ear pieces to the small size- it comes with different sizes for you to chose from for a better fit.  Not sure what the difference is between “noise cancelling” and “noise isolation” but I need to pause my music or turn the volume down to hear someone speaking to me. I’ve only answered a call once with the earbuds and it was okay- I could hear the caller fine and they could hear me clearly as well.  I prefer to speak into my phone rather than using the earbuds so that capability isn’t so important to me, but again it works fine!  As far as how long it lasts on a charge, I haven’t used them to the point of them “dying” and I just put it back into its charging case when I’m done.  I really don’t have anything bad to say about it. I am very happy with these Tozo T10 earbuds!",5,1,2020-9-25,1,0,1
"I just got these because I was looking for earphones instead of paying $170-200 for AirPods. These are really the best for the best price. They are so loud and fit my ear no slipping out.UPDATE***  These are the worst, as you can see from the picture only the left one is working and not the right. I am so pissed off because I thought these will last longer. It didn’t even make it to a month and they are broken already. I tried everything to fix it, even watch the video the company provided. Waste of $40 I will never again. The reviews and ratings looked so good but they are not.",1,1,2020-7-17,1,0,1
"I highly recommend this product, best by far Bluetooth earbuds I've ever bought. Within the first week I bought them I lost them, did not find for another three weeks. I was mad as I spent some good pocket change to by these bad boys and already regretted it as I lost them. I only found them after I washed my clothes, as I was pulling clothes out the dryer my girlfriend pulls them out my pants pocket and I'm like wow, there they are, ruined but found. So I try to turn them on for the sake of whats to lose and bam, both of them turn on. They survived three weeks off the charger, although off, didn't drain their battery as well as being washed in a washer and then super heated in a dryer as I dry my clothes on the highest setting. There was some little static at first but that went away within the hour. A week or so later I let said girlfriend use them, she drops one in the toilet, I'm grossed out and bummed but was like since it survived the washer and dryer this wouldn't kill it. Guess what? It didn't, it was fine after some rice and back to normal, it didn't sound off or weakened. Two days ago on the time that I wrote this dropped one in the water as I was washing dishes, bummed but I know these bad boys by now, some rice and wham bam slama lam lam ding dong, good as new once again. And I thought, I have not yet written a review, so here I am. I give this a 5/5 star and recommend this to all, as the sound is great and noise cancellation is great same with the battery life. I also dropped the charging case and my dogs munched it for awhile. Irresponsible owner I know, but at least you all know the ear buds and the charging case are very durable. Most earbuds I get dye out in six months or break, this one I'm sure is a keeper. I will add it to my will to my favorite grand child as it shall be a family heirloom, and should it die years from, I will burying it for its service to me and then proceed to buy another.",5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"My son wanted some wireless airpods for Christmas. He works in construction. He got some with his iPhone but hated the hard plastic & those wouldnt stay in his ears. I looked at the better models of the Apple ones for him & they were so expensive with mixed reviews.So, after seeing these TOZO's on multiple ""Best"" lists, I decided to get them for him even though I had never heard of the brand. **Best decision ever!",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"I purchased this recently and the quality and packaging of the product surprised me, it's so good that I have stopped using my Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones. These are great for workouts and answering calls anytime. They fit well in my ears and are not too big, they are just the right size, and you could change the silicone caps for your own convenience. The charger is very compact and well built, they do the work really well and at such an awesome price. They have a decent battery life and gets more with the charger pod. Will be buying more as gifts.",5,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0
"The volume is not great but the big problem is THEY DO NOT FIT! They CONSTANTLY FALL OUT of my ears! The pair that they come fitted with is the 3rd largest size. They go slightly into the ear canal but no matter what I try (including washing my ears and cleaning the inside with alcohol) they fall out. I put the largest pair on and they fit differently. They rest outside of the ear canal and are substantially larger.  Guess what? SAME THING!!! I have had them for months and if not for being so busy due to my daughter's very high risk pregnancy during the COVID-19 madness, I would have demanded a refund! If there was a slightly larger size about the. 3rd largest which fit the same way as the other 3, I would be pleased.....but when they fall out and hit the dirty floor or wherever else they fall it is hard to give this a positive review.",2,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"I’m not super big into wireless earbuds because I have extremely small ears (I am a very tiny person in general and regularly cannot fit in 000 clothing sizes, to give you an idea of how much of a struggle these things are) and worry about them falling out but I had to get some because my headphone jack on my laptop broke and I have to do all of these Zoom meetings. I was actually  super excited to get these because they had multiple sizes for the earbud portion. The smallest ones actually do fit in my ear canal but after 10 minutes they slide out, it seems like the weight of the outer portion of the earbud is causing them to slide out. The diagrams for wearing them make it seem like that outer portion should be able to sit in the auricle of my ear but they stick out past my ear so that’s impossible, and I have the inner portion stuck in my ear so far that they are physically unable to go farther without causing me intense pain. I haven’t worn these long enough to test the battery life but the sound seems to be pretty decent and the price is good, but unfortunately I will probably be returning these because having them slip out every 10 minutes is very inconvenient.",3,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"Read some product reviews which were mostly good so I ordered a pair and I was so impressed with the quality. The noise cancellation is great, sound is great, and the charger/case is very high quality too with a strong magnetic lid so you don't need to worry about it opening up or the latch snapping. I was so impressed with this the first day I used it that I bought another pair so I could have one at home and one at work. I can't speak for the microphone and I know that was a concern that I read on some reviews but these really feel like a $200 pair of headphones. Fantastic product.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"These little earbuds are Fabulous!  I bought them because I want to wear them while I exercise but I only like wearing one earbud at a time.  I hate having the ones that are connected and one hanging down...plus I have small ear canals and most earbuds do not fit or hurt my ears and/or fall out.  These have about 4 different sizes to choose from and they do NOT fall out of my ears.  I usually wear these biking, walking, and because these are waterpoof I got them to tread water in!!!  I havent tried them in water yet but I hope to soon.These were sooooo easy to use as well!  I opened them up put them in the charger for 5 seconds (like the book said). And then took them out and turned my phone to settings, bluetooth and they came up instantly.  And wow what great sound they have...some bass too!  I wasn’t expecting them to be as good as they are...definitely noise cancelling as well!  I’m in love.  The newer ones are touch but I mess with my hair wiping sweat off my brow sometimes and I didn't want to be accidentally cutting things off while exercising.  Its nice to me that with one click I can answer a phone or pause it.  I would say that I am surprised it doesn't have a way to control volume from the earbuds but I can control it from my phone so thats just as well.  These are fabulous!!! Buy them!!!",5,1,2020-9-28,1,0,0

"I bought these ans really liked them. I can go quite a way through my house away from my phone and still hear on the headphone. I like that I can wear 1 or the other or you can pair them. I lost one (I thought it was left on end table) for about 3 weeks then I order a different brand that were on sale at Best Buy.  They were junk! couldn't get more than 6 ft from my device they would cut in and out so I will be returning them. I purchases a 2nd set of these Tozo headphones which arrived few days ago, these a great too. My son was doing his laundry today and as he pulled them from the dryer out pops the missing headphone. It has some little puppy teeth marks, went through the washer and dryer! I charged it and it still works!  I don't usually leave review but these deserved one!!!!",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0

I was hesitant to buy a brand I knew nothing about, but read some of the other reviews for these and thought, “I’ll give ‘em a shot.” I figured if they were no good I’d just return them.

The battery life is great. They even do a great job in noise reduction. Pairing is so simple, too. I couldn’t be more pleased with this purchase!",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"So frustrating! The left earbud got sweat in the little hole and zapped my ear and then completely stopped working. The charging case still things it is charging that earbud, but the light doesn't turn on, and I can't press the earbud button to turn it on. I had another pair of these earbuds and never wore them to work out, but someone stole them and I got this replacement. Literally the second workout I decided to use them with, and this happens.Not worth the money if you sweat, and definitely DO NOT immerse these in water like the description says you can-- they can barely handle a drop of sweat.",1,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
"These are by far the best bang for your buck wireless earbuds. The 4 different sizes of included tips ensure that you'll find the perfect fit, and stay put during workouts, jogging, walking, etc.The sound quality is much better than I expected, and on par with other earbuds I have at much higher price points. The bass is deep, mids and highs are crisp and clear. I listen to mostly bass heavy music during workouts, but also classical, jazz, rock, etc and I haven't been disappointed.",5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0

The BT connection seems reliable and they sound great.Update - the seller contacted me and offered to send a replacement pair to try. Not sure if they have made some update or if some slight variation in mfg, but this time the 2nd smallest ear plug options now seem to hold these firmly in place and they sound great.  Thank you to the great folks at Tozo.",5,1,2019-6-15,1,0,0
"These earbuds could be great if it weren't for the short battery life of not only the buds themselves, but the case/charger as well.  I seem to only be getting 2.5 to 3 hours out of a charge on the earbuds before they start warning me that the battery is low.  This isn't with the volume cranked all the way up or even nonstop play for that time. Its probably 50-75% of the max volume and actually playing music 75% of the time.After I place the earbuds in the charger, they do charge quickly but I'm only getting 1 full charge out of the case before it needs recharged.",1,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0

He normally wears bulky wired headsets, but with these it's much more comfortable.  The sound is wonderful.  They're very powerful for the price.  Also, my son accidentally crushed one of them, twice.  The first time, I was able to get it working again (tough little thing), but the second time he crushed it, it finally stopped working.  I reached out to the manufacturer, and they offered to send me another set for free!  And it wasn't even their fault!  Thank you TOZO!

"This product lives up to all the things it promises. Water resistance, noise cancellation, smooth charging, battery lifetime, sound depth, ambient sound quality.  The frequency response and crisp clarity is worth the purchase. No lag or delay in sound delivery or in connection initialization. You can try this for a rich stereo experience. The bass range is commendable. If your android phone is on developer mode, you can tweak more to change/ fine tune Bluetooth audio settings and codecs in use.

I could see where the product was headed, and it was a matter of time until it fell out and broke or fell out and rolled to an unretrievable location. I wouldn't recommend this device with ow often it falls out.Sound quality was just okay. Bass was not strong, as I had to push it deeper into my ears to get good bass. That wasn't going to work for me. Not really designed for noise cancelation, either.",2,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0

I do experience a clicking sound every so often where my music is interrupted as if the headphones are experiencing issues with bluetooth, but it is minimal and quickly recovers. Also, I run 3 miles regularly and no slower than an 8 minute mile, and I have to constantly push these in so they do not fall out. I have small ears and have the smallest connectors on, but I will try a size up and see if it makes a difference. So far I am not disappointed, but I do not know any better yet.",4,1,2019-4-30,1,0,0

It's very annoying. These ear pods are also very loud.

I've noticed that you have to manually disconnect it from the laptop (I have a macbook) or else it won't automatically switch over to the iphone.  The only other thing I noticed is that there's certain apps (eg, SoundHound) on the iPhone that won't allow me to listen thru these earbuds.

After wasting all that money on headphones recommended by so-called experts on YouTube, I finally found these by accident on Amazon. I’d gladly pay 10X what I paid for these on Amazon.

This is a huge issue as I use the earbuds while exercising all time time.  The limited BT signal range made these earbuds effectively useless.  I know it is not my phone because my previous BT earbuds did not have any issues with range, and a newer pair I purchased after trying these out also enjoyed excellent range and no signal loss issues.",2,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0

"I'll preface this with I've never tried any of the expensive earbuds so I can't compare. I looked over a lot of pairs including all of the customer and professional reviews before I settled on trying these. It took me a day or two of use before realizing I had the wrong sized tips on them. They weren't really secure in my ear and I suspected I need to go down a size. They were even less secure with the smallest tips so I went up a size and they were instantly VERY secure in my ear. That also made the sound much better. Since I've gotten the size correct, I've noticed a little discomfort here and there. Nothing that makes me really regret the purchase.Regarding other issues I've seen in the comments here:",4,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
I have bought at least three other wireless earphones and Tozo is the only one that has worked properly and has great sound. I’m not very tech-savvy but I was able to follow the instructions on pairing and getting it to work on my smart watch. The sound is clear and doesn’t have any static at all; the power lasts longer too. The other earphones had horrible sound and didn’t last longer than two hours. I also appreciate that Tozo has three earbud sizes because earphones are usually too big for my ears and never stay in place. I used the smallest earbuds for mine and they always stay in place even when I am running. So worth the price!,5,1,2019-5-30,1,0,0
"I've had the opportunity to use the Tozo T10 buds for about a month. I wasn't expecting much due to the price, but I was thoroughly impressed by the sound quality and comfort. These replaced a pair of Anker bluetooth soundbuds that I was happy with however, they didn't last long at all. I am usually at the gym for about 2 hours a day, and haven't experienced any battery life issues. The charging case is very handy, but keep in mind you need to keep it charged even when the buds are being stored. I didn't use them for a week or so and they had died. The case accepts wireless quick charge, and micro usb. I charged them in my car on the way to the gym and I was good to go.The Tozo's sound great for the price! The imaging is outstanding for a wireless earbud, bass is more than adequate, and the higher frequencies are well balanced and not harsh or bright.",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"I purchased these to replaced my old bluetooth earbuds (which would only hold a charge for 40 min) to use exclusively at the gym.  Upon arrival I was a little skeptical of these earbuds.  The initial pairing with my iPhone 8 was simple enough but when removing them from the case for daily use they weren't automatically pairing with my phone.  I contacted customer support and they gave me instructions to reset the earbuds and that still didn't seem to help.  I came to find out that it just takes about 15-20 seconds to find and connect to my phone.  It's not a huge deal but I expected it to pair more quickly.  Custom support was quick to respond and friendly but you should know what to expect.  Their initial response will most likely be a cut and paste from the instruction manual or promotional bullet points that may or may not answer your specific question.Another issue I've found is if you remove the left earbud first, it won't pair with the right.  Even if you remove them at the same time, there's a chance the left will start looking for your phone making it unable to pair with the right.  So, lesson learned. Always remove the right earbud first.",4,1,2019-2-22,1,0,0
Initial pairing was a bit finicky but removing the devices and repairing the right earbud first addressed the issue. A few days in thus far and the sound quality of the ear buds are very good - very good bass and range in general. The available adapters to fit your ear size are a major plus. I like that there are no major protrusions which allows me not to be as careful knocking them loose when wiping my head while exercising. Call quality is good with sound in both ears and others say they can hear me pretty well even alongside area roads with moderate car traffic. Did a 10 mile walk last weekend and the earbuds lasted exactly 2 hrs and 43 mins (needed about 15-20 more mins to see me through the entire walk). One feature I would have liked was the ability to skip forward or back a song (my other pair of earbuds split features between left and right so double click and triple click handled that function on the right while call features were handled on the left) - not that big of a deal while I'm walking but definitely would have be a nice feature to have when I bike.,4,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"I wanted to wait a couple of weeks to review to give them a chance to work. They rarely worked at the same time. One ear would be on, the other not. Didn’t answer a call correctly. NOT a comfortable fit, tried out 3 sizes, and they still fell out on a WALK. and there was an odd static sound when no audio was being played. Gave them to my older son, he couldn’t find a correct fit for his ears and thought they were cumbersome. Too late to return, no one in the family wants them, so I am out $50+.",1,1,2019-10-13,1,2,0
"While these were by far the fastest Tozo earbuds to pair initially, and the sound quality is pretty good, I've not been impressed since that first pairing for a few reasons.  Pairing to a new device after that first one proved almost impossible.  I couldn't get the earbuds to even turn off and back on again so I could put them into pairing mode.  These stick of out of the ear quite a bit, and have a blue blinking light when on that can be quite distracting to the person next to you.  It is super cool that the case and ear buds are water proof, but that also makes the case very large as you can see in my picture (comparative case is the Tozo NC9s, which are my current favorite in terms of fit, ease of use, and sound quality.) Overall, not necessarily a bad product, just not my favorite after trying other wireless earbuds from their line.",4,1,2020-9-20,1,0,1
"would have been proper for the money, battery life is as expected, sound quality is expected, average consumer sound, not bad, not HiFi. mic quality as expected, not so good but the main purpose was audio for cheap which is fine but the left ear keeps dropping out and back in. it's Soo damn annoying. makes what would be decent budget wireless earbuds complete trash.Edit: The new earbuds sent are great and works fine with no connection issues. The customer support team is very responsive and eager to help. They really try to make things right. This is a company that stands behind their product with good integrity.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"Received the TOZO T10 as a gift for my birthday.  Right away I was excited to get them because I really enjoy spending time in the pool but not a fan of speakers.  One of the key features is the fit.  There are several sizes available and I selected a smaller piece that worked great.  Set up was easy too.  The Bluetooth connectivity was seamless and fast.  Once connected, the sound was perfect.  I use them for work as well with taking phone calls.  The sound quality for both me and the caller is very good.  I am sure you will enjoy.  Customer service responded quickly to an inquiry and was easy to work with.  Very helpful.",5,1,2019-6-13,1,0,0
Bought these to workout in the gym or to listen while doing yardworkand quite honestly,1,1,2019-9-15,1,0,0
"These definitely seem to be very hit-and-miss depending on your usage. They work fine so long as you're not turning your head a lot while they're in. I use them when I go on my runs, bike rides, and casually. When I'm on my runs/ bike rides, my phone is either in my waist pouch or in my backpack, so it's never far away. But for some reason, any time I turn my head specifically to the left, both headphones will cut out for a brief moment before continuing to play my music. Weirdly enough, if I'm working out in the gym, I can set my phone somewhere and walk away more than 5 feet and the connection stays fairly strong without cutting out. So these are finicky as far as when they decide to stay connected or pop in and out of service. My dad bought some of these and he's having the same problems.As far as sound goes, I can hear my music clearly when it's playing and these do provide a decent bit of noise blocking when they're in. I'm no audiophile, so I'm not going to try and go into super detail about the sound. But I can hear my music, there's bass, and it all sounds good enough for me.",2,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"Basic earbuds, I wish they had volume control and fwd/rev but for the price, these are great! Be careful to make sure that they're tight in the ear if you're running, heavy bag work, or at a urinal. I like the magnetic box, the ease of use... Great product. UPDATE: The left earbud crapped out for apparently no reason, and to add to running, jogging, eating, or just not literally hammering them into your ear every 13 seconds, the will likely not stay in a normal human ear. I do NOT recommend. Will never buy these again.",2,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
"I did not expect these earbuds to work as well as they did, considering how inexpensive they are, but this might be one of my favorite purchases from Amazon in year.  The earbuds fit well and the sound was clear (bass came through especially well).  Charging them was also exceptionally easy, and the case is small, so it will be very convenient to carry around during trips. I ordered them in the white color, which fit my needs, but I do appreciate that they come in a variety of colors.",5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"I was encouraged to post a review by TOZO after contacting them with a support request for these headphones.I purchased the T10 model around January of 2020 - they were working great until around May - great sound quality, really good fit of the earbuds (this is uncommon for me!) and stayed in really well! The battery life was pretty impressive as well for about six months of daily use (for at least an hour or so each day!) - then they started disconnecting themselves anytime I tried to play any sound through them (although they oddly would stay connected up until I started playing anything). I contacted TOZO in Sept after trying their reset steps (e.g., discharging and recharging, cleaning the metal contacts, charging the case alone) and they kindly corresponded with me to suggest these steps, and then offered to send a replacement because we couldn't figure out why they stopped working. Looking forward to updating my rating/review once I receive the replacement and try it out!",4,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"I love these ear buds! The only issue I have with them is that even the smallest rubber parts are too big which makes them pop out of my ears. But I have this problem with every pair of ear buds I've ever bought, so I just use them without the rubber pieces. Besides that they are great. I work in an office and usually have one in my ear at a time, I need to be able to hear the phone. It says they last 4 hours, but they last closer to 6 hours on one full charge. Once one of them dies I'll pop in the other one. I also love how the case can charge the ear buds. I usually charge the case fully every 2-3 days. This was my favorite christmas gift this year. Great product for a good price!",4,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"I've been searching for a true wireless earbuds for a while. I'm happy to report the search is over. I am very impressed with this product! Even the packaging and manuals inside are quality. The charging case feels sturdy and has a good weight to it. It closes using magnets, and it is strong enough that it won't open accidentally. The earbuds fit nicely, and there are different sizes for the tip for a comfortable fit. It is incredibly easy to pair the earbuds, and once paired they always automatically connect to your phone when taken out from the case. When you remove them and put them back on the case they disconnect automatically. The sound is rich and there is some good base going on there! It's also nice that you can pause and play music pressing the button on any of the earbuds. The fact that it is also waterproof, including the case, and that it can charge wirelessly, it's just the cherry on top. It's a no brainer for me to recommend this product!",5,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"I got these to replace a pair that weren’t consistent in operating right.  My main use is for watching TV at night.  I love just about everything about them,  They fit my ears well & even though they have what some consider a short listening time, they work great for me since I only use one at a time.  They pair and connect better better than any I’ve ever had.  I can’t really review the sound quality for music, because my major use is for TV and movies and that’s great.  My only complaint is they’re too loud & can’t find how to adjust volume.",5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
Well I love these wireless ear buds! They come with multiple earbud sizes as well as the ones already equipped. I've had trouble though with the right one falling out? Well maybe I'll try one of the other sizes. But the sound quality is great! I haven't tried them in or around a pool but will let you know! I just want to add that I switched out the ear bud on the right for a larger one and it doesn't fall out anymore! One thing that might be helpful in purchasing these ear buds is have a friend help you in making sure they're a good fit! But they send multiple sizes of ear buds so it should be okay. 😊,4,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"I purchased the Tozo T10 earbuds for my wife after purchasing a competitor's bluetooth earbuds that she was not satisfied with. The competitor's earbuds were hard to pair, had poor noise cancellation,  have clunky function buttons on the earbuds, have hard to understand and incomplete written instructions and the earbuds made her ears sore.When the Tozo T10's arrived, we were impressed with the premium packaging right out of the box. The T10's are very easy to pair, the written instructions are clear and thorough, the sound quality is outstatnding as is the noise cancellation, the earbuds have integrated touchpad function buttons, and they are very comfortable in her ears - all superior to the highly rated competitor's earbuds. In addition, the T10's have a sturdy, water proof case/charger that includes a free lanyard to fasten it to a backpack, purse straps, etc. The earbuds and case include excellent battery charge indicator lights. The T10 case can be charged with the included USB cable or wirelessly if you have a wirelss charging pad or stand - an excellent feature! I actually charged the case using the Wireless Powershare feature on my Samsung Galaxy S10 phone. Also included are 4 sets of silcon ear adapters in different sizes for a comfortable, custom fit. The earbud touchpad function buttons make it easy to powere on/off, pause/play media, and answer/reject or hang up from a phone call. The instructions included Tozo's website URL and a scannable code to access their website for support, instructions and warranty registration.",5,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"These are fine. I'm usually not comfortable with this type of earbud, and these are typical of that. They connect reality easily and stay connected. But they can be greedy with the Bluetooth connection and occasionally connect while I'm not using them causing my audio to drop-out of my phone speaker if they're in range. (Yes the phone was ""disconnected"" from them). The audio is crisp and clear however music doesn't move me when I use them. It just there. Backgrounds noise. Nice, but meh.",3,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"Great performance for the price, and I love the matte finish and gray color. Very high-quality materials, from the plastics to the magnets to the silicone. I have several pairs of wireless earbuds, but these are a step above the rest. I also was pleased to find that the magnets that hold the earbuds in the charging case are strong. Placing the earbuds into the case results in a satisfying “snap” into position and a perfect electrical connection every time. Very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a great value.",5,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
"Update:I have used and love my ear buds in white. One of my favorite functions was the touch control. I ordered a pair for my husband in black, and his don’t have touch control. They have a button.

"These earbuds are great for my use. I usually put them in at night and listen to podcasts, then set them back in the charging case to recharge for the next night. I can usually get a week's worth of nightly use out of the earbuds before I recharge the case.The sound is nice and clear and very deep. Almost too deep. I need to use a third-party EQ app to dial out some of the bass to make it enjoyable for me so I can listen to the music I want, so I usually stick to just podcasts without music. I have a pair of Tascam TH-300x headphones if I want to listen to music.",4,1,2020-6-8,1,1,0
"I received my earbuds today. My first pair ever, in the past I've used LG headsets. My only concern is keeping up with them individually. I haven't done enough research to see if they have a locating option if you do lose one. However, so far I'm super impressed, packaging was nice quality, paired easy, and the sound quality is awesome! I'm ready to start using them on a day to day basis, working out, driving, at work, etc. 1 year warranty is a nice gesture. I hope to have these for awhile and plan on using them a lot. Will update when I've had more time with them.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"So I’ll let you know how after my two weeks in Costa Rica. They arrived about 3/4 charged and were very easy to pair with my iPhone 10 Max.  Do you automatically know when I’m talking on the phone so I don’t even have to press the buttons. The sound quality seems a little louder in the right year than the left. That’s why the four stars. Also, the four sets of different sized earplugs fit comfortably. The largest extra large clear did not have the extra plastic piece inside so I don’t know if they would be defective but I don’t need extra large so I didn’t make a claim.  Very easy to register my free one year limited warranty and of course, I am thrilled as always with how Amazon deals with Detective Mike and’s anyway. A very good purchase, easy to carry and I love that it has the charging base that comes with it.",4,1,2020-1-22,1,0,1
"I’m a 73 year old walker. I love these T10s. Pairing them with iPhone X was a breeze, and they hook up to it before I even get them in my ears. They have a great sound and stay in place until I elect to remove them. The case they come in is jewel of thoughtful engineering. Easily charges the earbuds multiple times even when it’s unplugged. Magnets in the case hold both the buds firmly in their sockets for charging and the lid down to protect them. The lid is smoke grey, but translucent so you can see the charge level of both the case and the ear buds. I’ve charged the case both via a wireless charger and via the USB C connector. Both ways are fast and flawless. All and all, a great buy with an eager to know your satisfaction level service department.",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"Let me start by saying I like these headphones.  They are good for making telephone calls.  However, I am a runner.  With the closure of the gyms in my area during the COVID-19 pandemic, I am exclusively an outdoor runner (not my choice but have to play the cards you are dealt, I guess).  These headphones have great noise cancellation and are good at the tail end of my morning runs when I have to call in to a daily conference call for work.  However, there is no way to control the volume or skips songs.  So I cannot conveniently change the song when I am running because I have to take my phone out of my armband.All in all, I like the headphones.

These are quality headphones.  They fit snugly in my ears and they stayed in. The key is to find the right size earcaps (they provide 4 sizes).  The sound quality is very good. I use Spotify which provides a way to set the equalizer to your preferences.  I am sure apple music and other apps provide similar capabilities.  The noise reduction is reasonably good and actually lowered outside noise as I walked through my neighborhood. Support is excellent!  I wanted to reset the earpods and wasn’t sure how to do this. I sent an email to their website.  I received a personalized response and was very satisfied with their support.,5,1,2019-9-7,1,0,0
"Not exactly the best looking buds(they look like (the look like after dinner mints for your ears) but fortunately I use them to listen to frequencies when I sleep.

"These earphones are much better than I thought they would be. I got them after my last pair of Bluetooth earphones stopped working (the kind with the annoying wire connecting them) and was worried about these falling out of my ears but they fit in perfectly and stay in even during jump rope exercises. The SOUND QUALITY is soooo much better than my las pair too and I don’t see why anyone would pay $150 for apply AirPods when you could have these. Excellent clarity on the lows, mids, and highs. These are top notch wireless earbuds. I haven’t tried them swimming yet, but I plan on trying that sometime soon. They also come with a year-long warranty which makes you feel comfortable actually trying them in the water! Unreal.",5,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0

"Quality earbuds at a great price.  Stay in well and sound is good quality.  Easy to pair and battery case is a convenient size.  Great for exercising at the gym and in the pool!Editing this review a few months later per request of the seller: I've used the ear buds daily in the pool while swimming laps with great success.  Unfortunately, the right one stopped working after a few weeks so I just wore the left - which was fine.  The left stopped working a few days ago and I miss having music with my swim!  The seller has agreed to replace the ear buds. (I did register for the warranty on their site when I received the first pair.)  The seller has been very responsive and easy to work with.

I buy everything on amazon and read the reviews just like you. Not sure if I got just a bad pair or not. I am always willing to give the company another chance. I have only had mine a few weeks and i have had nothing but issues.Sometimes they connect, sometimes they dont. Sometimes the left ear works,sometimes it doesnt. Now today, 6/24/19 the left wont work at all.Ive tried resetting the bluetooth, turn them on and off in different sequences, charging it etc. Nothing.

"I compared the sound to regular apple headphones the quality was the same (of course if it was Bose quality this would be perfect headphones), battery lasted 2.5 hours which was good enough for me because I don’t listen music for that long or I’ll get a migraine, and finally they are very light which is convenient compared to Bose wireless headphones (which are super heavy by the moment ) they need to be light so less chances of falling while being active. And they are waterproof (I took a shower with them and still alive, they survive the shampoo as well )",4,1,2019-12-22,1,0,1
"I gave it 2 star only because it has bluetooth issues. Other than that they are good. I've used them for running, jumping rope and no issues there with falling out or loss of signal. In the gym you'll experience it because if there's slightest obstruction and your phone/mp3 player is like 3-4 m away it will lose the signal then reconnect and so on.If you dont plan to use it where obstructions exist i thing these are good headsets it's just in 2019 you'd expect that even the cheapest producers can deal with technology which has been around 2 decades or plus..",2,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0

I tried adjusting the earbuds, but nothing worked.I gave a second star because the output was good.",4,1,2020-4-27,1,1,0

I have another pair of headphones from another company that fell apart. I hope these don't fall apart either, but only time will tell. As for sound quality, all of these headphones have similar quality, and it's good. I would never spend a lot of money on ear buds. Total waste of money. So I always recommend these more affordable options.",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0

I got these ear phones a while ago and they only started acting up recently (last couple months or so) after hundreds of hours of use. The battery on the buds wouldn’t last long and the case wasn’t holding charge for long either, a problem I never had previously. Other than that, they are fantastic for their value, maybe I just got a bad pair.

"My wife bought these for when she is cleaning the house and working out. They are pretty decent headphone's. The fact they are waterproof is pretty cool and they stay charged good. The only reason for 3 stars is that even with the smallest ear peices that go on the headphones they still were to big for her ears. She had to use the peices she had off her old headphones. And even with those, the head phones still are a little on the heavy side so they fall out of her ears alot. Which defeats the purpose of the head phones being wire less if they wont stay in your ears anyways.. the sound quality is better than I thought they would be with great base. But wish they went just a little bit louder. All in all they are decent headphones that are wireless and waterproof for a decent price. But probably would have spent a little more and got a different pair had I known they would be so heavy and not stay in her ears properly.",3,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"When it comes to shopping for things online, or even just thinking about maybe getting something, I go straight to reviews. Overall these seemed pretty solid for for the price point. I wasn't expecting much in terms of the audio quality to be completely honest, but they far exceed what I actually expected. I'm on the low end of being an audiophile and I really get into the sounds and picking up on things in songs that people never really actually hear or care enough to listen for, but this buds have the clarity and it's not a jumbled mess. Normally I use HyperX Clouds with 7.1 on but these actually come close to them without the 7.1 on.Right when I opened the package i went to see how they felt in my ear and it wasn't bad, but decided to try all the sizes out and went with the smallest of the grips and that really helps with the noise cancellation. I can only hear things faintly when there's no audio playing.",5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"I use headphones to work out and hike 3-4 times a week, and I have 40% hearing loss in both ears.  So I’m sensitive to sound quality as it greatly improves my experience when listening to music.  Often as I turn the sound up to listen easily, poor sound quality becomes very apparent. These earbuds fit comfortably and securely and provide great sound.  Especially for the price!  I was using BeatsX headphones before and these are much better (and MUCH less expensive).  I like the waterproof aspect as well.  I was hiking recently and got caught in the rain, and I didn’t have to worry.  Well I did worry, but they had no problems.  So, now I can relax.",5,1,2019-8-17,1,1,0
"I don't understand why it's impossible to buy a pair of headphones that work for even just half a year. It took me a while to pair these first time out of the box, but multiple resets later the left finally paired with the right, and everything worked great... until yesterday. Now no matter how many times I reset, restart and re-connect to bluetooth, earbuds refuse to pair and there is no sound out of the left earbud. And it looks like the 6-month tech support window conveniently closed just a couple of weeks ago for me to get these fixed. Perfect!Sounds quality is mediocre (little bass, dull/distant sound). Feedback from the other side of phone calls has been mixed, with some callers telling me that they can barely hear me. Can't take them further than 20 feet away from your cell phone or the sound will cut out. Fit is good along with noise cancellation (just find the right size ear piece).",1,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0

They have 4 full charges in the case itself, the earbuds SOUND great with plenty of bass (find the right fitted ends for the earbuds).

people try to give a accurate account on what they hear and we trust them and buy. sometimes they are right and sometimes they are dead wrong. well i been looking for a pair of blue tooth ear buds for 3 months and most of the big name brands like bose jabra and others have annoying issues and if you look at reviews its only 3 stars. well let me help you and save you time and money and a real review: I just bought the TOZO T10-R $35.00 i think it was and i must say  talking on phone has been good> Good tight fit . they are not falling out. most of all is the sound now if you are looking for all bass and not really sound then keep it moving but if you care about quality sound then stay right here .sound is really great i mean crystal clear and no delay in nothing video or music and there is enough bass to make you happy trust me. the more i listen to them the more i love them even at max sound level crystal clear .if i had just one more notch  of loudness they would be a 95 but 94 out of a 100 is not so bad. hope to help somebody because some of these reviews on others earbuds like the ones i'm returning are so sad. they say good or great  and its far from it.,5,1,2019-2-2,1,0,0
"I honestly feel bad for anyone using Apple-mimicking products when this is around! The click when you put them away is soooo satisfying. Theyre never a hassle, they charge faster than I can put on my socks, and they play music for at least 5 hours (from my limited experience). The case is wonderful because you can literally just clip it onto your keychain, and because you can see the lights so clearly through the covering, it’s a pleasure to carry around with you. The design is great, because eventually you get the feel that they’re just earphones you never worry about charging. They connect automatically EVERY TIME within seconds, and disconnect automatically when you put them away and they immediately start charging. I don’t even need to mention the quality of sound, which is superb!Note: You can not change the volume or switch songs with the wireless earbuds alone, all of that must be done with your phone. They are unable to respond to “hey Siri” or “ok google” unless the phone can hear too. It’s not annoying, it just brings the phone more into play. Doesn’t affect my five star rating! All in all, a wonderful product.",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"I’m not sure how these headphones are getting the reviews they are getting. I’ve purchased three headsets, prices varying from $35 to $45 dollars, and in my opinion, they’re not worth it. The good in these headsets is that they sound pretty good. There’s a good range of lows, mids, and highs. They’re cordless. And they’re water resistant (I’ve showered in the pair I use). However, the bad news is that they are useless for phone calls. If you try to use these to talk on the phone, the person on the other end can’t hear you. This is a big negative for me because I like to be able to work at the computer while I’m talking on the phone. Also, the battery life is inconsistent. Some days I get a few hours of use, but most days I get an hour or two before they’re telling me the power is low. This is after they’ve been on their charger and plugged in all night. I’m getting the same review from the two other people I’ve purchased these for. In the end, I’ve had much better Bluetooth headsets, for more than half the price of this pair. When it’s time to get new ones, I’ll be looking elsewhere.",2,1,2019-1-31,1,1,0
"I found myself needing some wireless earbuds for simple tasks like listening to music while walking around my office- I don't always have pockets to carry my cellphone and wire earbuds around with me- or working out. I kept seeing prices in the higher $100+ range and really didn't want to spend so much when I would only be needing them for arguably frivolous reasons. I was thrilled when I found these!I received them a few days ago and am more than happy with them. Super simple to use, attractive design. I don't think a sound purist would be thrilled with these as the quality isn't amazing, but it's perfect for what I needed and doesn't bother me at all. I also love that they are water resistant, since sometimes I walk in the rain and have had issues with my normal wire earbuds.",5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
"Update, the company had reached out to me to either give me newer model or refund 40 dollars.  Got to say I'm impressed.  We shall see how new model works.The earbuds are always on. So you have to constantly recharged them. That's probably my bad. if I had read more about them I would have realized that issue. The other problem is they keep disconnecting from one another while they're in my ears. Also they will not connect to my library app called Libby. So I'm sorry I purchased them. They're awful",4,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
No matter what I tried these don’t fit and fall out. My husband also had the same problem. He’s a big person and I’m a small person so different ears. We tried the different ear thingies and nothing works. Unfortunately I missed the return window and when I contacted the seller they gave me a formulaic answer of “just try the ear thingies” even though these should have a warranty. I’m contacting Amazon because of the poor product and poor customer service.,1,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"I bought a pair of cheap ""AirPods"" at Marshalls to see how the real ones would fit in my ears before purchasing, needless to say they did not fit at all and were huge, which was worrisome to me. I decided I needed headphones that would fit all sizes and that's when I stumbled across these beauties. These headphones are absolutely insane for the price. They have great sound quality. The only downside would be the bass isn't as strong as I would like, but once again for the price it is incredible. Another huge upside is that these fit my tiny ears and stay in place perfectly! I also love the charging case where they are magnetically charged (best way to describe) I would definitely recommend.",4,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"I hadn’t had these for very long before they stopped charging.  Sometimes they charge, sometimes they don’t, sometimes one does.  Often they’ll turn on on their own and from the charging box when they’re nearby. Annoying because I’ll be on a call and suddenly, without being touched, and from across the room, they’ll turn on and connect to my phone.  So there i am talking and cant hear the person on the other line (nor can they hear me) because it’s now on Bluetooth. Annoying.  When they worth correctly, they’re decent earbuds.",2,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"I was super excited to finally get wireless earbuds and was ecstatic when they came in. I had read some reviews mentioning that after a few charges, the earbuds case would no longer charge. I was hopeful though that it would hopefully not happen to me. Unfortunately, it did. I've tried several outlets and chargers to bring them back to life but to no avail. It's truly a bummer because they really were nice earbuds while they lasted ( a month).  Hopefully, no one else runs into this problem.UPDATE 5/25/20:",5,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"While the bluetooth pairing worked better than expected; the microphone quality on both iPhone and Android is seriously lacking to the point of unusuability. I tried multiple settings and configurations to address this but everytime folks complain about not being able to hear me so I have to just turn them off. It's unfortunate because I really wanted these to work. Also after having them out of use for awhile I wasnt sure if the battery was dead or not because they wouldnt turn on again until I put them in the case. Kind of weird, because I put them in for less than a second and they were on again. Not sure what's going on.",2,1,2019-7-11,1,0,0
"First of all, I am a sound engineer so precision audio is my business.  For the price you cannot beat the sound quality. I’ve read some of the reviews that don’t give these earbuds enough credit. From an engineer perspective these are great. You must understand that different audio platforms are going to sound different ie, using your phone device, these earbuds produce precise sound of the recording you are listening to.  From my experience, some music that I listened to they sounded pretty bad, then I listened to some quality recordings and they sound amazing. This told me that these earbuds are as good as the recording you are listening to. Listen to crappy recording they will sound like crap. Listen to quality recordings they will sound amazing.One review stated that they lacked in high end. I propose that the audio recording he was listening to lacked in high end, not the earbuds. The same goes for low end. These earbuds produce plenty of high end as well as low end. iTunes has an EQ where you can adjust these settings, therefore boosting highs or lows. YouTube and other platforms do not so the sound will only be as good as the recording.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0

"This is pretty disappointing... These sound great. They last a long time and they charge very fast. I especially love the bass. Why 1 star? The left ear bud cuts in and out a lot. Doesn't matter if it is in single ear mode or both. Not sure if it is related but it also cuts out both, saying disconnected the connected again right after.... I have tried this on 3 different phones and my computer, it does this on all of them. Do not really feel like going through the return process over this so I will just deal with it since I use these every day.",1,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0

I especially like that there are different ear bud cap sizes provided to find a fit that works for you. If you're the type of person that is really into peak sound quality and very picky about that, these probably aren't for you. I still use my Beats to headphones listen to music. I would say that given the price, the quality of these are pretty good and I would recommend them to a friend.",5,1,2019-8-24,1,0,0
"I bought these thinking they would be a sub par replacement for my broken wired headphones. They are NOT!The sound quality is better than average,  nice bass and midrange.  Highs are good, but not studio sound.",5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,1
"The sound quality is impressive, with deep bass and no tinny highs, although I'm no audiophile so take my opinion with a grain of salt if you wish; they sound exceptional to the average person. They are lightweight and don't feel like they will fall out. The provided case is a little bit chunky but no more so than any other similarly spec'd item. The battery life is good enough for what I would consider moderate to heavy daily use; the option of wireless charging does reduce the hassle of keeping them topped off though. My only major gripe is about the buttons. There is no option to change volume settings through the earbuds themselves, and the buttons are a little bit hard to press meaning you might uncomfortably squish the buds into your ear canal trying to do so. Overall I'm satisfied with these earbuds and would recommend them to anyone looking for a reasonably priced and high-performing true wireless earbuds.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"Received the product back in July and have been thoroughly impressed thus far. Given the price point, sound quality, and durability these are a far better value than the AirPod alternatives. AirPods may have slightly superior sound quality (emphasis on slightly), but the noise cancellation, durability and rubber ear piece give this greater utility. You can actually go on runs without these falling out.We must have gotten a bad batch, because 3 months after use the driver on the left earpiece started showing static, but the company offered to send a replacement immediately at no cost. At a 29.99$ price point, these are a fantastic buy.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
"I purchased these to replace some cheaper headphones of mine thinking they would be an upgrade. Unfortunately, I was very wrong.Firstly, connecting them to my device in an absolute disaster, they do not pair as one complete set, instead they pair as two seperate devices and I am only able to recieve audio from one earbud at a time, depending on which device (which earbud) is selected.",1,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"I was recommended this product by my co-worker, and I was a bit skeptical at first. First, I was unsure of the brand itself, and then I was unsure of the quality. However, I took a leap of faith, and ordered the earbuds. After receiving them, I charged the case/earbuds for 1 hour, and used them while I went out for a run. Generally, anything in ear tends to get sweaty and falls out for me, so I use over the ear, DJ style, headphones while I workout. These little buds stayed up, did not get sweaty, and the BASSS! The bass was deep, rich, and of some of the best quality i've ever heard in headphones/ear buds. I used to listen to music using August EP650 headphones, and i absolutely love those, but a little bit of moisture, and those would turn off. I went through my run, in light rain, wearing these buds, and they still work; thus the IPX8 rating checks out for now. I still want to test them while I swim in a pool. Overall, great little product, price point is unbeatable, the sleek design is enticing, and the noise cancellation is of decent quality for a product that doesn't even mention noise cancellation. DEFINITELY BUY THESE!",5,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
"I've been a big fan of TOZO's products for a while now, and the T10s have been my daily headphones for the past 5 months. In my time using them, I've found that they are extremely lightweight, comfortable, and have incredible sound quality for the price. With so many truly wireless headphone options available on Amazon, it was hard for me to make a decision on these, but I'm so glad I did.My wife just got a pair of Airpods 2, but I like these better. The seal of the T10s provides excellent sound isolation, and I think they look a lot better in the ears than airpods do! Highly recommended!",5,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
"I had been exercising for years without using headphones; however, after COVID resulted in gyms being closed I started running more often. I love audio books and decided to purchase these wireless headphones so I could listen to audio books while jogging and running.The overall quality and ease of use is excellent.  I'm a tough critic as an engineer who does consumer product design and I love these. The sound quality is excellent, the fit is snug and comfortable, and I have not had any battery life issues. I've been jogging about four miles several days a week plus running stadium stairs and doing sprints with them. I have had no problems and honestly I'm thrilled.  I highly recommend this product!",5,1,2020-6-27,1,1,1
"I unfortunately had to return these ear buds. Even with the assorted silicon ear buds the right one would not stay in. However, the left one gave me no problems. I think it’s note worthy that I do not typically have the problem with ear buds.As far as the actually product and quality goes.... The sound quality was actually pretty good. It was also very good with noise cancelation. I wasn’t able to really test the battery life, but based upon other reviews I am sure that would follow suit with the other good qualities. This is a great product for the price. As I was only able to use one of the buds I could not justify keeping them. Had both properly fit my ear I would have kept the product and been satisfied with my purchase.",4,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"So I ordered these and the left one refused to pair. I followed all the steps repeatedly, reset, etc.  so I contacted Tozo customer service directly from their website. They asked me if I did x z y etc. which I had and nothing worked so they immediately sent my a new pair at no charge.They’re fantastic seriously. The sound is amazing!  I have tiny ear canals apparently so have to use the smallest size buds (you get four sizes) but once I got the right fit they stay in really well.",5,1,2019-4-25,1,0,0
For the price the sound quality is great!  I use them on the plane and can't hear any extraneous noise when playing music through them.The noise canceling is basically the result of plugging your ears with buds.  There doesn't appear to be any type of active cancelling.,4,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"The T10 ear buds sound good, if you are a base head these are great.  Honestly I have not heard an earbud with more base than these.  Not in a bad way either.

The blue tooth would drop and TOZO customer service stepped up and took care of it.Also got a pair of T6 ear buds.  Not as much base but clear and the charger case is about half the size.",5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0

I usually have around the ear, noise cancellation,  Bose for work so I am used to quality. These are quite good, especially for just $49! These are great for outdoors, waterproof, you can take one out if you need to be more aware of your surroundings, sweating is no big deal vs conventional headphones, easy to stick in your pocket etc. Good job TOZO!",5,1,2019-5-28,1,0,0

"Compared to the high end $80+ I saw online this one is definitely worth it's money. Great sound quality coupled with it's noise cancellation and you hardly have room to complain, in fact I have none.Battery life could be longer (3 hours approximately) but in reality it's hard to use the earbuds for 3 hours straight, I just make sure to always store them in the case to make sure they're always full charge between uses.

"For the price, they do what you want them to do. The music quality is basic and the battery life is just around 3 hours (in my experience).

"These are the first wireless earbuds that I've used, so in terms of ease of use, I have nothing to compare to. However, they are just as good as any wired in-ear earbuds, just more convenient because you don't need to have your phone close by to listen to music. I use these earbuds for casual listening, and they have worked perfectly when connected to my iPhone. However, when connected to an older Macbook, the sound can get spotty since the Bluetooth isn't as strong.In terms of comfort, they don't fit my ears as closely as I'd like. Although the manufacturer includes 4 pairs of ear bud tips in varying sizes, my ears fall somewhere in between, so it's not an exact fit. Also, the instructions for wearing the earbuds indicate that you have to twist them horizontally until they lock around the inside ridge of your ears, but my ears are a little larger in that area, and so they tend to sit loosely. They have fallen out of my ears before, so I don't plan on heavy exercise with them in.",4,1,2019-3-31,1,0,1
"These earbuds do the job, and they do it well! TOZO takes no shortcuts when it comes to sound quality, battery life, and overall performance. The charging case is slick and fits in my pockets easily, and they earbuds fit nicely in my ears. Being a fan of EDM, they came through with good bass- and I really listen to some heavy music, as a reference. I would recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a high end, quality earbuds that won't be particularly inferior to the likes of Apple Airpods in any way. Great price, great sound.These earbuds also feature little tid-bits that only add to them. The charging lights on the case shine dimly through the translucent lid, displaying the charge level of your buds and your case neatly. The magnetic click to the case is stylish, and the small adjustable cord that is included makes keeping track of the earbuds easy. The textured plastic makes the case feel solid and durable, and the weight of the case and buds together is satisfying and carries a sense of quality and sharpness with it.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,1
"Just got another pair on a whim / for backup, I put them on before a workout, and I knew right away I couldn't use them. The sound is just too bad, too muffled. Anything that needs any high end sounds especially bad. Music isn't enjoyable.The plus sides are fast BT connection, steady connection, good battery life, tough construction, and good waterproofing. The form factor is decent too, not too goofy looking.",2,1,2019-7-25,1,0,0
"I held off on getting wireless buds because of the cost.  I decided to give these a try due to the cost being affordable to me in comparison to other brands.  I couldn't be happier with these buds.  Whether I'm sitting at my desk, working out at the gym or walking around the office building, these provide fantastic sound quality and are stable in the ear.  The wireless charging option if key for me as I try to minimize the amount of cords on my desk.  I have yet to have them die on me because the box holds a charge and when you put them away, they're constantly charging.  Connectivity is quick when removed from the case.TOZO's customer service is above and beyond.

These are by far the best earbuds I have ever owned. I've had these for a few months now. The right gets used the most as I use them at work and I still need to be able to hear things. I have put the right bud through the washer AND the dry twice now. It still works perfect. Today I dropped it at work and it fell into an ash auger for our boiler I was cleaning at work and I thought it was gone. It travelled close to 30' in highly acidic ash mixed into a slurry with water and fell out the bottom of the boiler. I thought it was totally gone. While cleaning up I ended finding it rinsing it off with the garden hose and it still works perfectly. 10/10 would buy again.,5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0

At first it felt strange to have wireless ear buds but it’s an easy adjustment. I also got these because I don’t trust apple’s as I feel they’ll fall out of my ear. These will NOT fall.

I mainly use with Audible and have to rewind due to losses.  Sound on music is good with deep bass. Most calls are clear and my voice is clear, but wind noise is amplified for the other caller.  The charging case is nice and compact.  The buds are slightly large and tricky to keep in if you are active. There is no way I'd swim with them, as they've fallen out just walking.

Only issue i have, and i've had this issue with other similar products, every now and then it can't decide which one to send the signal to. i'll have the left ear bud in, and decide to use both and it will cancel the left and move it all to the right and vice versa. but just put them back in the case and pull them both out and works just fine.",5,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"I was in the market for bluetooth earbuds and decided to give these a chance after reading so many positive reviews about the sound quality. I have to admit, I initially purchased the Pasonomi iXP7 rated bluetooth earbuds, but I just needed a better experience in terms of sound quality. I'm not sure about others, but these are the earbuds for music enthusiasts. If you enjoy listening to music while being fully engaged in sporting activities, then these are for you. The sound quality is as good as one could hope for, I love listening to music with deep bass and these exceeded my expectations and delivered where the Pasonomi earbuds could not for me [(but it did for my wife :-)]. The sound quality is amazing, crystal clear, and I haven't experienced any issues with battery life in the four weeks that I've been using my TOZO earbuds.

"This is an initial impression review.  Just came off the truck while I was doing yard work. Packaged well within its own box. The box seems to be made out of the same plastic that small 12v power supplies are made of so its durable for sure.For a moment I thought that if you only wanted to use one bud with the other in its case you could only use the right bud. If you  take one out of your ear and put it in the box to charge it will do so uninterrupted.  But if you take it back off the charger you will need to power cycle.  I assume the right ear bud is the ""master bud"" or something.",4,1,2019-8-19,1,0,1
I was kinda skeptical about ordering these at first but i must say these are impressive for the price very solid and premium feel too them these headphones almost feel like they’re worth $200 excellent sound quality and they provide you with extra ear tips for different ear sizes. They’re magnetic so you don’t have to worry about them falling out of the charging case not to mention it’s pretty convenient that you can charge the case wirelessly too. I must say well worth spending $50 on these.

Using these for the gym or just general purpose.

The second I would dip my head below water, they would immediately disconnect and the only way to reconnect is to go back through my phone. This obviously does not work for anyone who is actually trying to swim laps. I have tried since but have had zero success.

"I was looking for the best earpods in the 50 dollar range and didnt want to buy the Samsung ones for 120 when I can get a pair that 12,000 people have reviewed as amazing. First of all... the charging box is awesome. Theres literally enough battery life in each charge for most my day to day use. And its 4x full charges in the magnetic, solid plastic and well designed case. The magnetic lid that rotates open snaps back when closing with a strong but easily accessible magnet. The earpods themselves are minimal and a.matte black, and has standard size swaps for ear shape/size. They kind of rest back under a part of the ear helping secure or prop it into place. I've yet to have them fall out or even feel iffy (have not ran or worked out with them yet. You can wear them in a pool swimming laps. And I'm hesitant but they have a year warranty. And claims waterproof. The sound is better than the tether wired powerbeats 3, by far... in all aspects including the much needed and lacked by ""beats,"" bass. They knock harder than expected. Not so much as some, but just right. Works great with movie and game surround sound. As a person who never writes reviews but am stoned and HIGHly impressed... forreal. Now I can tune out my talkative can drivers at 5am daily. Buy these. They're what you're looking for. Unless you like trash.",5,1,2019-9-28,1,0,0
I love the fact you can charge it on a wireless charging pad. I love the face you can use the earbuds separately or together and the sound quality is wonderful.

Only had these for a few days so far but I really love these buds.  Time will tell how they hold up but they are an all around 5 star unit.  Wish I would’ve bought them sooner.  The bass is incredible for such a small unit that was really surprising to me.  When I was shuffling around music just testing and a post Malone song came on and the bass slammed I was like wow that’s incredible how low the bass drops and still sounds good in them.  I have beats solo wired headphones and these sound comparable. The range is ok probably like 20 feet. The call quality seemed good. My wife said she heard me good when I was talking to her on them.  They fit in my ear nice and snug with the large rubber.  The charging station is nice and I like the fact I can take it with my and basically have a whole day of use with the charging station fully charged.  I haven’t killed the battery on them yet as I’ve only used a couple hours at a time and then put them back on the charger.  The company emailed me also offering a free wireless charging pad and I agreed so time will tell if it actually gets sent to me but seems like a nice gesture.  All around great.  I wanted a decent set of Bluetooth earbuds for work or working out or making calls and these blew away my expectations.  Very satisfied.  Purchase with confidence.,5,1,2019-4-27,1,1,0
I received these for Christmas as a gift. I love them . They are great for working out also the fit is one of the best fitted earbuds out there. The sound is great . I love everything about them. The only thing that I don’t like about them is the battery life . Their is some times when I work nights and have to charge them 3 times for a 10 hours shift . I would say there customer service is extremely great. Because one of my earbuds is not connecting at the same time . So I can only listen to one at a time. I emailed them and they responded in one and told me they are send me another pair for free.,4,1,2020-10-3,1,0,0
"Pro: Works good enough for my ~1 hour long runs and was cheap. I only wear when running, and I am content with the product. They stay in perfectly when I'm not sweating ( I wear the largest size earbud covers), and I love the sound quality as well as lack of background noise.Cons:",4,1,2019-9-4,1,0,0
I needed to replace another pair of wireless earbuds that had been damaged during travel. I did quite a bit of research on Amazon before deciding on the TOZO T10 pair. These are great for working out. Music sounds rich and clear with a lot of bass. Phone calls are crystal clear. Noise cancelling is almost too good but I don't mind. The only problem I had was with the silicone tips. I had to replace them with foam tips as silicone never stays in my ears at all. After that upgrade these work for hours without falling out.,5,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"I own an iPhone and I'm one of the few people who refuse to purchase expensive earbuds. I came across TOZO a little over a year ago when I purchased a wireless charging pad for my iPhone 1max pro and it works great. That product left a good impression on me and I looked into their other products. I recently bought a pair of the T5 Bluetooth Sport earbuds and let's just say they are awesome and work well for me at the gym or when I go running because they fit over the ear and hold perfect. Being that they were so affordable I looked for another pair I could use outside the gym and running so I purchased the T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds. These earbuds sound great and are lightweight whereas my ears do not fatigue during lets say my entire 12hr work shift. TOZO makes really good products. The pairing processes couldn’t be simpler, and the charging case is a bonus and works perfect with my TOZO wireless charging pad.",4,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
I wanted a pair of waterproof ear buds for swimming laps. Even the one page brochure appears to advertise it as a good way to swim and listen to music. This is not true. The minute they are even slightly submerged the signal is lost. If you swim with your head constantly above water then these can be used for “swimming.” Any competitive swimmer will be disappointed.I wanted to leave only one star but I do admit they did a good job ensuring that they pair easily and the sound quality is fairly decent.,2,1,2019-2-26,1,2,0
"My typical use is 30-40 minutes at a time, maybe 2 or 3 days in a row, maybe after a couple of weeks sitting on the shelf in their case.  Perhaps that is the problem.  In 40 minutes of use I've not run the earplug battery dead, but I can count on the earplugs AND case battery to be dead after sitting in my office for a couple of weeks.It's as if the ear pieces never turn off even though I see the red (off) indicator when I return the earbuds to their case to their case after use.  As for 2 or 3 recharges from the case -- forget about it.  Even with my short use I've never been able to go three consecutive days without plugging the case in to charge.",2,1,2020-1-19,1,1,0
These are my 3rd (technically 4th) pair of wireless earbuds and definitely the best. I lost my first pair but they were too bulky. My 2nd pair crapped out which let me to a replacement 3rd pair that didn’t even work. These ear buds are a little thicker than I’m used to as I have small ears. But the sounds quality and volume is great. My last earbuds were not loud enough and I would have it on the loudest setting. But I can have these at middle volume and it’s enough for me. I do which they were touch sensitive instead of a button but I guess I could always buy the T6 for that.,5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"Everything is great, but just for those who need in-depth information on how it sounds here it is (and I will be critical):Highs are very weak. The mids and bass are chokingly loud compared to highs, which might be an attractive option for you bass heads out there. But, don't expect much clarity in music. I am guessing due to waterproofing, many high frequencies are getting lost.",4,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"1)Terrible battery life, about 3 hours max listening to music. Can't work all day and use these....And they do not stay charged very well. They will randomly connect to my iphone once the charging case uses it's batteries up.2)Takes too long to pair, cannot just use one ear bud. Most of the time I have to use my phone to manually pair them.",1,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0
I’ve had these for a few weeks and wanted to try them out in my daily routine. I love the charging case and use them for my job making lots of calls during the day. The sound quality is better than if I had my phone on speaker and my clients can hear me well. As for music you just have to get the right angle in for them to stay and voila you have great noise cancellation and sound! I might still play around with the ear bud sizes when I go for runs as they can fall out if not placed in properly. Easy to pair and sync to your phone! I’ve recommended to a few of my friends now as well,5,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0
"For around $35 these earbuds seem to be good quality, particularly for the price. The negative reviews I've read appear to center around the sound interruptions. This does occur, however I will say (for whatever reason) that the more I used the earbuds paired with my device, the more I found the sound interruptions were significantly less frequent.The sound is exceptional as well as the noice cancellation. Consider being super careful about the volume though because I would be concerned about hearing issues. This is my second pair within a month because I lost the right earbud, so be mindful of where your buds are at all times. The magnetic charging station is really nice. I haven't tested the ""waterproof"" quality yet but am certainly tempted. The charge could hold longer (approx. 3 hours) but I guess at this price you're going to sacrifice some things to certain extent.",4,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
I received a pair as a gift and they did not work right out of the box. One of them would cut in and out until it completely stopped working. I recently received a replacement pair and they were just as bad. I returned this pair as well and went with a different brand that are working perfectly.,1,1,2019-7-23,1,2,0
"The TOZO wireless earbuds were exactly what I was looking for. I watch many YouTube videos late at night and really needed something quick and easy to wear to listen to videos while my family slept. I thought I had selected the white colored ones upon ordering but i received the black ones and I was still happy with them. Will love a second pair for my husband who’s a runner but will have to wait for now. The different size earbuds that come with the product help out but my teenage daughter was still unable to find the right size for her when she tried to borrow them from me since she has super tiny ear canals. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for wireless earbuds.One thing they did not have that might make them better is the ability to control volume. Unless I totally missed the instructions on how to work the volume feature, I don’t think you can do that with these wireless buds. The feature of easily managing phone calls simply by tapping on the earbuds is so cool though!",4,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
"I'm always on the fence when it comes to buying earbuds because I'm never convinced they'll fit in my ears. Initially I bought these for traveling but I've recently been using them to work out and they're perfect! I'm pretty sure one of my ear holes is bigger than the other 🙃but since these come with 4 different bud sizes, I'm able to run, jump, lay sideways and still keep the earbuds in BOTH my ears. I'm truly happy with my purchase and definitely recommend these to anyone looking for wireless headphones.They were also delivered extremely fast and the customer service reps have been phenomenal. After I registered for the warranty, one reached out to me directly to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase and even offered me a free wireless charger.",5,1,2019-5-17,1,1,0
"I rarely use the earbuds, but I do try to keep them in my purse ""just in case"". However, it seems like every time I go to use them the battery is dead. Take just now for instance. I charged them completely last week or so, popped them in my purse to have when I need them and haven't used them since. When I  took them out to use just now, I found that they wouldn't turn on because the battery is dead. This happens every time unless I use them immediately after taking them off the charge. When I can use them, they are nice enough, though they don't fit in my ear as snuggly as I would like (I have to keep pushing them back in). At this point, I am pretty disappointed since I can't use them for what I intended.",2,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"I have purchased several headphones and earbuds over the years. I have small ears and most are uncomfortable. Not the case with these. I had to change the size of the ear piece to the small after that the fit perfect! I am semi active, I go to the gym and do vfc the  Elliptical and I also play disk off this Bud stay in my ear without me happened to fidget with them I love them!  It did take me a minute to just to the noise cancelation, wasn't used to not hearing things around me the sound quality is great I have no complaint this was a very good purchase.",5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
"I Love the sound quality of the product and how it provide good sound cancellation. The battery quality is pretty good since I being able to complete all my runs (that are around 47 mins everyday)After a month and a half of using them 5 times a week my right ear bud stop working in all my devices, I attempt resetting them, charge them, put them off my device and install them again. After calling Amazon and go through the same process of troubleshooting and the right ear bud still didn’t work they provide me the vendor information since the warranty with Amazon was overdue, I contact the vendor and soon enough I received an email the same day advicing me to troubleshoot the item and if this process didn’t work to contact them. I respond the vendir that the process didn’t work and the vendor apologize for the deffective product and compromised to send me a new pair.",4,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"So far I love everything about these earphones. I have had multiple kinds of wireless headphones and am always getting the wires hung on everything. These are so comfortable, they stay in my ears well. The sound quality is fantastic. I haven’t tried them in the shower yet, but will do that soon. I will be ordering more to give for gifts. They are wonderful!! They pair easily to my phone and IPad. Noise cancellation is great. They are comfortable to wear also. I have small ears, so the small bud that comes with works very well for me. My 27 year old son LOVES to sing in the shower, I am going to buy him a pair of these for Christmas, he will love them as much as I do.",5,1,2019-4-27,1,0,0
"I read the good reviews, but you know how you do wonder if they are genuine.  I figured this wasn't a huge investment so ordered the earbuds and crossed my fingers!  I have an iphone 11 and these paired as soon as I connected my bluetooth settings in iphone.  Every time i use them now i just have my music app open, take the earbuds out of their little charging container and can hear them tell me they are on and connected - so cool!  It took me a few minutes to figure out the 'touch' controls and how hard to touch them.  Its actually very lightly. Sometime it confuses a 'hold touch' for volume down, instead of off, but I realise I don't need to turn them off as once they go back in their case they do this anyway.  I haven't tried out their waterproofness yet, or running with them in, but I reckon they'd be great.  Very happy with my purchase.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"I received these on 4-6-2019  and I've had them about 5 days. Let me say first that for 50 dollar in ear headphones they sound great. A little heavy on the bass, but still better than I expected. The battery life so far has been about 4 hours for each one listening to a mix of podcasts music and phone calls and the charger seems to get about 2 1/2 charges before needing recharging itself. They come with several sets of tips, so you probably won't find that to be an issue as far as fit goes. If you have trouble getting them to stay in, remember to stick them in and twist toward the back of your ear until your ear acts as a brace. Mine haven't fallen out since I started doing that. All in all I'm a very satisfied purchaser at this point. I'll update this review if anything changes.",5,1,2019-4-10,1,1,0
I have tried numerous wireless earbuds and in the end they have all let me down. That is until I received these earbuds.The first thing I noticed was the obvious improvement in quality of the charging case. The previous cheaper brands I bought were flimsy.,5,1,2019-10-1,1,0,0
"once I realized I was putting them in my ears upside down, they sound excellent when worn properly! Paired quickly and good range with bluetooth 5.0. Good strong bass, nice clarity in mids/highs. Very comfy to wear for several hours.. Only thing I wish was different the charging port is the older micro USB, wish it was USB-C, but thats a minor deal.I have not tried the phone mic, and probably wont, so cant say anything as to that.",5,1,2019-8-11,1,1,0
"I use these daily to do tasks such as lawn mowing, watching youtube vids and listening to music. I would not call the sound quality audiophile grade, but they sound great for non-critical listening or for just enjoying music. I replaced the tips with comply foam tips which made them more comfortable and added to the ability to block external noise.  Battery life is great and they recharge fast in their case which is good for a few recharges.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"I was actually surprised to find that the charging case not only has a built-in battery,but also wireless/QI charging available (in addition to the USB C port- ! I guess I was just too focused on the specs and reviews when purchasing, but I mostly wanted buds with decent sound quality and a stable, comfortable fit. These nailed all of my checkboxes, including being able to use just one at a time.The only shortcoming so far has been when testing the mic and noise cancellation, mw wife said my voice was really soft and she could still hear the washer in the background. Again- not what I got them for, so still pleased.",5,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0
Been using these for a few weeks now.The construction of the product and charging case is good and the product sound quality is impressive for the price. Battery life is fine but I do notice if you listen at full blast like I do it's slightly shorter due to the increased power consumption. They charge at a decent rate though in the case so it's not a huge deal.,5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"They fall out so easily that you can't actually do any activity while wearing them. Furthermore, the left earbud often fails to pair with my phone. This is frustrating. Overall, I don't think it's worth the money. (Sound quality is tolerable, by the way.)",2,1,2019-1-21,1,3,0
"After doing research and reading a lot of reviews, I decided to buy this pair of earbuds. I am glad that I did. While the first pair I received was overall great, I did have a little problem with them - they would every now and then switch frequencies or something where it would go off and then back on with a little different sound. I contacted the company to ask what to do. After I tried unsuccessfully to do some trouble-shooting that they recommended, they sent me a second pair right away. These have worked great.The sound is good. The options of different earbuds for the size of the ear canal are great. The base charges quickly on the quick charge that I also bought from Tozo (though they also charge quickly with the cable). I have even worn them in the shower while listening to podcasts and they have been great. I have run with them and they don't fall off. I would recommend these to others.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
This is my first pair of totally wireless earbuds for the gym. I couldn't recommend them any more highly. They've never fallen out of my ears during workouts. No more wires of any sort to get caught in a weight. And best of all the batteries have never once run out during my workouts. I can be in the gym upwards of 2.5 hours and the headphones still have plenty of battery left when I'm done.I enjoy the charging case as well. It's great to be able to keep them charged on the go.,3,1,2019-4-25,1,0,0
"I've been on the market for earbuds for a long time and i finally thought that I got the headphones that I have been looking for. They fit perfectly in my ear, they sound reasonably great, but THE SOUND KEEPS SKIPPING. If my phone is more than 2 feet away from the headphones, the connectivity is so terrible that it is almost unusable.I'm not walking to the other side of the house expecting these to stay connected, but if i put my phone in my pocket, i would expect the headphones to have a stable connection to my phone. But for whatever reason, the connectivity is terrible and it skips parts of my music/podcast as it re-connects itself.

"Got these buds in the mail, as I was looking for something to use while hiking, kayaking, biking, spinning poi and firespinning, and doing things with my dog.  Extremely easy to use, connect, and get working.  Sound quality is great, although they aren't as bass-y as my normal no-name Skullcandy wired ones from Walmart, so I'm a bit disappointed by that.  Also, really confused on the choice of a redial last caller action when double clicking.  Seems very, very random - especially considering there's not next or previous track actions.  Despite this, these earbuds are great for the price and the latter especially is a minor complaint.You get a carrying case that also acts as its' own battery powered charger, which I didn't even realize.  I thought that you had to charge via micro-usb, and assumed it was just a carrying case beyond that.  But it offers multiple full recharges for the buds, which I haven't had die on me yet after a few hours of use. Very nice surprise and quality of life feature.  Fits comfortably, offers multiple different sized ear pieces, just great in general.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"At my husband's suggestion, I need to purchase another Bluetooth because the 3 I own batteries die so quickly. I've purchased wireless earbuds the prior month, but they kept falling out! It seemed like I was the only one with this issue. I decided to give wireless another guy when I read a review that this product comes with extra earcaps in different sizes (thank you). I also like that the charging box also be charged wireless. I also like that it is black, small and discreet compared to other ones. So far, so good.",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"These earbuds are advertised as being waterproof.  Sadly, this I did not find this to be true.  I had used them for 2 months, liked the sound quality and they were comfortable but was disappointed when the first time it got wet one of the ear buds stopped working.  I purchased these particular headphones because I knew they would be getting wet and didn't expect them to give out so soon.  Very disappointed!Edit.  I contacted Tozo and explained what happened and they offered to replace he headphones for free, no questions asked.  I appreciate a company that will stand behind their warranty.  I was always happy with the sound, fit and functionality of the earbuds but initially gave it a poor rating because they weren't ""waterproof"" as advertised.  I'll be more careful with the new set and try and keep them out of the water. I've changed my rating to 5 stars because of the great customer support I received.",5,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0
"Although the signal for some strange reason fails sometimes when I am walking with my phone in my pocket, the earbuds are amazing.

Never felt so free to do whatever I want and listen to my music or watch TV or whatever without bothering anyone.It took a while to pair with my laptop, but it worked out in the end. The battery is not the best, but lasts over 3 hours with a single charge. The case gives you around 3 or 4 charges so you'll be ok.",5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0

Paired to my phone in less than 10 seconds. Sound is great! They fit your ear perfectly. Doesn’t irritate your ears being worn for long periods of time. The buds are also magnetized to the case so they won’t fall out. The case is compact, easy to store and carry anywhere. Packaging was great! Lots of padding. Plenty of bud covers to fit your ear better. Charging cord is very short but not a problem. Can’t rave enough!",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0

"Ive had these for roughly over a week they're a great pair of earbuds. The sound quality is top notch i usually have my volume all the way up with other devices but with these i keep the volume low and theyre still loud, the bass is also really good. I wasnt expecting the noise canceling and was thoroughly surprised by it. But as stated in the title they're not flawless. One of the benefits of bluetooth accessories is that they allow you to be hands free with these you can only play/pause music and answer/end a call. You cant control the volume or change songs so just keep that in mind. Im not sure if i received a faulty pair but when listening to audio sometimes the sound will briefly go out for a sec or two & then come back. Which shouldn't be happening but again might be due to a faulty pair. Overall the quality & price for these are great but with the flaws i have to give them 4 stars.",4,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0

These are the fourth different buds I've purchased having been disappointed with the others.  I'll look no further! They pair & connect to my phone effortlessly.  Works great for phone conversations.  I use it primarily to listen to podcasts while floating in the pool & it is wonderful.  My neighbor's kids are screamers & this blocks about 3/4 of the noise.  I can still hear them but a bump up in the volume of the buds & they're gone.  When these wear out I'm buying them again. A great value.,5,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
I really loved these earbuds. A little while back they stopped working for me (one would not hold a charge and would always connect to my phone and drain its battery along with my phones battery). I contacted TOZO and they quickly and professionally helped me get them the right information so that they could replace it. If i could I’d give them a 6/5 for customer service. The only reason its 4 stars is because the first pair of earbuds didn’t work out. Hopefully with the new pair I can come back and give it a 5 star review.,4,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0

The T10 is way better in terms of sound quality and fit than any I have previously purchased. I was very pleasantly surprised the first time I wore them. Easy to charge, easy to pair, and I love the bass with I’m listening to music (I’m a 60’s rock guy) I was hopeful when I ordered but given the price compared to ‘high end’ buds I didn’t expect greatness. In fact, these earbuds are better than my expensive Sony, Beats, and Bose earbuds that I have. Highly recommend!",5,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0

They automatically turn on when you take them out of the (charging) case, which has light indicators to tell you how much charge it has.  The earbuds don't hold their charge too long; I can do about two 1.5-hour workouts before I need to recharge.  The charging base can be placed on an external charger for a wire-free experience, which is pretty cool.",5,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
Great headphones. The only issue is that my left ear is having difficulties with the seal. But that’s not the earphones fault. I will try a different size cover and hopefully that will keep the left side in place.I haven’t worked out hard with these just doing elliptical type stuff and the right one has stayed in fine. I have no problem hearing the music or book I’m listening to and they were easy to connect. I will say that I just switched from a galaxy s9 to a iPhone XS Max and they seem to pair faster with the iPhone. But again it is only a few seconds of difference and not something I’m actually complaining about.,5,1,2019-7-13,1,0,0

Not sure about the claim (at least in the instructions) about being able to use them when swimming.  Bluetooth and WiFi don’t transmit through water and as soon as there is any water between your eardrum and ear phone, the sound is absolutely muted.

"I have a pixel 3xl (Bluetooth 5.0) and I cannot have my phone in my pocket and wear these earbuds.  If I do they cut out constantly.  If I take it out of my pocket, the range at best is probably 10ft at best.  Past that you have to be looking at the phone. By that I mean, if you turn your head, the earbud does not have the power to get a signal through your head and to your phone; it will cut out.  They are horrible earbuds, I really don't get all the positive reviews.",1,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0
"First, I lost a pair of Bose earbuds that are similar. I did not want to spend a lot on another set and these filled the bill. They were shipped fast by Amazon. They were ready to use out of the package. Took about 4 seconds to connect to my iPhone, and sounded incredible. Much better than the Bose. I asked about leaving the case on a charger for one to two weeks and was quickly told do not do this. So response to questions is very fast and thorough. I would buy another pair. They have a really good support team. Answers are swiftly returned and they go out of their way to make you happy.  I am happy.",5,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0
"I bought two of these, one for my self and one for my son. My son charged and set up his set right away. He got a phone call from his friend while wearing them and he said the clarity of their voices was excellent. We both wore them to the park and for me the sound was amazing! My son was really thrilled with this product.When I used these to listen to my music I found the pairing to my phone easy.  The battery life seems to be lasting fine. So far this has been a great purchase. I find that these earbuds are better fit than Apple. We have been extremely happy with our choice!  Thank you.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"These are some great earbuds and I've been in love with them since the first time I've used them. Music sounds great through it, but I've yet to use them during a phone call to see if the mic works and I'm able to be heard by someone else.They aren't very loud, I turn my music all the way up and I feel like there is still more need for it, but that might be because I'm always blasting music and losing my hearing.",3,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones because not only were they ""best seller"" recommended on amazon, but they were a good price with lots of decent reviews! I placed my order and got them well before the expected date. I set up the warranty offer and set them up. They're easy to connect, to charge and work, but not even a minute in to my first run with them I had issues.I had to hold my phone in my hand in order to have a good connection which still seemed to cut out when the wind blew. Headed out on a second run, same problem. This time I checked the manual they sent with it and reset the headphones as it instructs to do when there are connectivity issues. Still no luck. Attempting an exchange now so I will update this with the review of the second set once I get them",5,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"My search for GREAT earbuds is over! I have spent several hundred dollars on multiple different earbuds that ultimately ended up not working for my purposes for multiple different reasons. Thankfully, these Tozo T10 earbuds have put an end to that. Right out of the box they were easy to pair with eachother and my devices. They are super easy to use. They are very comfortable in my small ears, yet they have different sized cushions for different sized ears. I've been using them 3 months now and am just add happy with them now as I was when I first got them. In fact: I bought a second pair to keep in my car in case I forget them and need them when I'm away from home, I also bought a pair for both of my son's for Christmas, my mother even bought a pair and lives hers.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"At first I was impressed with the sound quality, fit and the case. However I ran into a HUGE problem. The bluetooth on these is horrible! If I walked beyond 5 feet of my phone, they would cut out. Additionally, even with my phone in my pocket, they would cut out every 30 seconds in one ear, sometimes both. It's too bad, because other than that, they seemed good. Looks like others have had the very same issue. I tried to disconnect an repair the bluetooth but same results. I ended up getting the Juckbo 5.0 Earbuds and couldn't be more pleased. More comfortable and bluetooth works across the house. Not as loud, but loud enough.",2,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0
"I have had these for almost a year now and they are still going strong. I tend to be extra rough on earbuds and headphones in general and was looking for a cheap pair of wireless earbuds that would be waterproof enough to use in the shower that I wouldn't mind when they eventually broke. These have taken a ridiculous beating, including falling down a garbage disposal while doing dishes and being ran through the washer and dryer when accidentally left in my pocket and they are still working great. The sound is a decent quality for the price, a bit bass heavy but I like it like that. They also do a great job of noise canceling to the point where if I want to hear the people around me I have to have only one in at a time. The only downside I would say is the battery life. They tend to drain quickly only lasting 3-4 hours at a time however, I generally will use only one at a time and switch them out when the battery dies. The case holds a few charges so it's easier to keep them going when you're out and about. Overall these are surprisingly great quality for the price and have lasted well beyond what I would have expected.",5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"I've now purchased 2 pairs of these Tozo T10 earbuds in the last 9 months, the first ones were mine and the second pair for my oldest son.  They sound great, are comfortable to wear, and I feel are the best bang for the buck!  I use mine when outside working in the yard, mowing etc...  I've also used them on a couple of airline trips, but I have a pair of over the ear wireless headphones that do a a little better job of noise cancelling.  But for a general purpose BT earbud, I really like these units.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
"I'm extremely happy with this purchase.  I use it at my work computer and the charging station is very convenient.  You just drop the earpiece in the slot when you're not using it and it charges.  As soon as you pick it up, it reconnects with the device.  It does take a few seconds to finish connecting, but that's not even something that's worth getting annoyed over.  I was a former professional musician, and I can say that the sound quality is excellent for the price and the bass is better than any in-ear solution I've tried.  Buy with confidence!",5,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"Comfortable, convenient and hold a charge well. I have been unlucky with wired earbuds, but so far, these are doing the job.Update: after I've day, the right ear bud would not show up in my Bluetooth list. After using tech support, I returned the defective pair and received a new set. So far, the sound is fantastic and they are comfortable. The only negative is that they only hold a charge for three hours--but it is still manageable, especially for the price.",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"Very easy to connect. I like the charging case. The sound quality is good when listening to music, or watching videos. But there is a slight hissing noise when they're connected, but nothing is playing.**Update after A few months: i keep finding little things that annoy me. If using an app with intermittent sounds, there is a small delay for the ear buds to fire up almost like waking from sleep mode. There are tiny LEDs on the buds that blink every few seconds. It's not noticable during the day, but very announcement.",3,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0

I had previously ordered the $300 Bang & Olufsen 1646102 Beoplay E8 2.0 Truly Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds and Charging Case - Limestone and returned them due to pairing issues, sound quality and fit. I hesitated to buy any others for fear of further disappointment, but I saw the reviews on these and decided to pull the trigger. Don’t regret one bit! These are the find of the century  and I’m beyond satisfied. I purchased the tan ones and they are very trendy and slick. Full package - stylish with awesome sound.",5,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
I received my Tozo T10 Wireless Earbuds and was cautious on how they would be given their low price in comparison with other wireless earbuds. I have to say I have zero regrets.They come with 4 sets of rubber ear tips for determining the best fit. The case is sturdy and you can see through it to determine if the device is charging or fully charged.  They are also wireless charging capable which is super convenient.,5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"I bought these for myself since I still had wired earphones.  These are amazing for the fraction of the price compared to name brand earbuds.  The sound is great, battery life amazing and they charge super quick.  I workout 5x a week 2 to 3 hrs and they have worked amazing.  The only thing is they have fallen off a couple times when on tredmill or lifting weights maybe about 3 to 4 times.  I've had these for a few months so not too bad.  I highly recommend them for people who do not want to spend hundreds.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"Sound quality and connection are solid. Product itself is super high quality.  Really impressed with these given the price point. Hands down buy these!Only con: once every other day it seems, they are a bit finicky to connect to the phone (Pixel 1).

"I used these for about a month. I missed the return window so I just kept them. They lose connection regularly and are not easy to pair with each other, or to a device. Honestly I think I just forgot to return them because I have no idea why I would have kept them. The sound was decent as long as they were connected, but if you move your head the wrong way, the connection will be lost and during a workout because I would stop working out to try to fix this issue. This got to be so annoying that I just stopped using them altogether.  I never got to test the battery life because I never used them to battery exhaustion, just mine.",3,1,2019-9-7,1,0,0
I was really impressed when I first put these in my ears and played some music. Generally ear pods in this price range don't have good high frequency response and even less bass response. These ones are pretty natural and don't have that fake low-end that some big brands seems to be popular for. If you're more of a purist and want the sound to play the same from your speakers as you do from your ear pods these are a great option for you.,5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"I have only had these for a week but I am so far very happy with them. If you just follow the instructions how to put them in, they fit great and will stay put. They sound is good and the box is convenient and makes it easy to bring with you and not loose. They sound when you turn them off is a bit low so I have sometimes hard to hear if they got turned off or not, but that might have to do with my age :).  I use it when I do hit and put my phone on floor or desk while exercising, sometimes it does loose connection in a ear, but only temporary and for a short brief second. I am happy with them and hope these will last a long time. I sweat like crazy when exercising so my problem has always been that and that no earphones seem to survive that. We will see.. but so far I can recommend these!",4,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
THESE WORKED GREAT FOR MY HUSBAND FOR A WEEK UNTIL THE RIGHT EAR BUD STOPPED WORKING PROPERLY THE VOLUME WOULD GO IN AND OUT UNTIL IT COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING ALL TOGETHER.

THESE WERE GREAT FOR A WEEK I BOUGHT THESE AS A GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND AND WHAT A SURPRISE THESE THINGS ARE CRAP I AM UPSET AT THE TIME FRAME I HAD THEM FOR HIM WHICH WAS A LITTLE OVER A MONTH DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,1,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0
"I used to think one size of ear caps fits all until I see this product come with 4 different sizes of them. I was happy at first, but am annoyed now because one of the earbuds often falls off my ear no matter what size of cap I use.I have a hard time to get both earbuds to work at the same time on the same device. Can only use either left or right!",2,1,2020-3-26,1,0,0
"This is my first foray into wireless earbuds. Several sites had good reviews on these and for the brief amount of time I have had them I can so they are exceeding my expectations. I have no idea about battery life as they are still on their 1st charge. I was pleasantly surprised about the microphone sound quality, people I speak to say it sounds very clear.I really like the wireless charging and the fact that you can get 4 charges of the earbuds out of one charge of the case.

Super annoyed. Lame. Also, they kept falling out of my ears, and I listen to music and articles while cleaning as a cleaning lady, so while they are waterproof, I was just waiting for one to drop into a toilet while I’m scrubbing it.  Gotta be better buds out there than these.",2,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
"Overall a pretty darn good set of headphones for the price. Some things you lose out on - range isn’t quite as good, and you can’t listen with just one at a time while recharging the other. Also of minor note: low battery warning gives you about 30 seconds before they cut off, and they have an obnoxious pairing vocalization - both sides announce 2-3 things over top of each other, all basically just saying it’s connected.All of that considered, I’ve give them 5 stars. Certainly not as good as AirPods, but they have some features AirPods don’t, and they’re 1/4 the cost. What causes these to lose 2 stars is that I’m 2 days past my return period and they’re already pealing in terms of the coating on one of them. Granted I’ve been using them - in water and while working out - my I got these for those purposes, and if they’re only going to last you a might, but just skip getting your hopes up for a product that will ultimately not deliver.",5,1,2019-4-28,1,0,1

This is an issue that’s been mentioned by other reviewers, too, so it seems it’s pretty common.These have been excellent so far. My previous (different brand) had been was a pain to connect and pair but I didn’t realize that wasn’t normal until I used these. These are super easy to use, have great sound and do well blocking most noise. They fit comfortably and hold a charge a really long time. So far, I’m loving them.",3,1,2019-7-13,1,0,0
"I have been using these earbuds for about a month now, and I am happy with them. The sound is crisp and clear, they block enough outside noise that I have to remove a bud if someone wants to talk to me, and they were easy to pair. The one small thing I note is that the right bud, for me, doesn't fit perfectly, and feels like it's slightly loose. I have had luck turning it towards my face and it seems to fit better. The buds otherwise fit securely and I'm not worried about them falling out, even while running, stair runs, and jumping jacks. I use them about 2.5 hours per week on one charge, and they have never run out of juice.",5,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"I got these earbuds for my dorm room. Knowing that I’ll have 3 roommates and that I’ll want to hear my stuff without hearing them. The noice cancelation is REALLY good. My girlfriend has been using them while I play games with my friends to watch AHS. Video reviews say there’s lag with YouTube, but I haven’t noticed any.  The bass isn’t crazy but it’s there, first pair of ear buds I can’t turn to max volume. The only ONLY thing stopping me from 5 starring it is the left earbud. For some reason the left earbud is quieter than the right and it’s REALLY noticeable and distracting. If you pull the right one out far enough and push the left one in as far as it can go that’ll fix it, but it’s an inconvenience. The battery life is right on par though, lasts roughly 4 ish hours. Had it die in 2 hours but I might’ve forgotten to charge it the night before. I read some low star reviews saying the left one cuts out. I don’t get that, in fact I can get the left one pretty far from the right, you just can’t cover it. How ever, again, the left one has a weird connection issue when it comes to volume.",4,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"Good old, middle of the road quality. Sound is not epic, but it's good and pretty clear. The set up is easy. They can get pretty loud, but without quality settings. Base, treble and all of those good things are not even or great. I'd just say they're a good buy if you need something to workout to or other small tasks. Of you're looking for great sound quality for something like gaming or really listening to music for true enjoyment, this may not be the set for you.",4,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0

My office partner was sitting at his desk and I was unable to hear him talking to me, so the noise cancelling aspect works well. Also, the earbuds charging station/case is a bonus. I have not used them with my phone yet, so I don’t know how well the microphone works. I wore them continuously for about 4 hours and found them to be more comfortable than headphones.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
I was pleasantly pleased with this item. The battery life is super long. I sneak to listen to them at work and they are easily hidden under my hair. They connect to all my electronics so i can control the volume from my Apple Watch. I listen to one ear at a time so when one ear starts to die i can easily switch them out with the charging case. The hold a long charge.The only thing I didn’t fully like is the fit. I used the smaller buds but after long wear it starts to get a little uncomfortable.

"First, if you have  more than one device that you have paired with this product, beware. It will constantly try to pair, and tell you it is connected  wih both deices, but it will not work. Once it gets confused, it is an effort to ever get it to re-connect. An aggravating and dangerous task if you are driving. In my case, an Iphone and Ipad in the car together. It simply cannot do this. In addition, the left channel problems are real. Seem to be when the source device is in close proximity, it is as tho the left channel want to pair directly  with the device, rather than the right earphone.  I am returning.",3,1,2019-7-9,1,0,0

It doesn't matter what rear bud size you choose Nothing works it does matter how great the features/function are. If they can't stay in my ears That makes this product absolutely garbage. They fall out all the time. I hate that I paid for these  because  they are useless I want my money back but its too late now. So I'm stuck with this trash",1,1,2020-8-27,1,0,1
Poor quality; the right earbud quit charging after the first time it was charged up and the left earbud stops working as soon as it gets damp; given that these are meant to be waterproof for use in a swimming pool they clearly are not functioning as advertised.,1,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
"So, I've been an over-the-ear headphones guy my whole life. Earbuds tend to hurt my ears after a while, and I've found it's very difficult to beat the sound quality of good over-the-ear headphones. Having said that, these earbuds come really, REALLY close.The sound quality is better than anything I've ever found in any earbuds I've worn in the past; listening through them really wasn't very different than listening with my over-the-ear headphones. The bass is satisfyingly powerful, and when seated properly, the high notes come out rich and full, instead of tinny and pitchy like with most other earbuds. They also fit very comfortably enough in my ears that I don't worry about them falling out, and while I haven't tested the battery capacity to its limits quite yet, they last long enough that I haven't yet had them die on me in the middle of my walks around town, which can sometimes take up to two or three hours. Even if they had, though, they can recharge right in the case, which can hold up to FOUR full charges before the case needs to be recharged again! That's incredible! As for the mic, I haven't used it much, but those I've spoken on the phone with while using these headphones never complained about the sound quality, even after my asking them, so at the very least I can say with confidence that the mic is good enough for casual conversations over the phone.",5,1,2019-8-1,1,0,1
"Edited: great customer service. They are sending me a new pair to see if they work better. Also, having tried to other wireless earbuds, these are by far the easiest to use charge and use the functions with.I love that these earbuds are wireless, and they have good sound quality for listening to books or music. However, when I'm talking on the phone, the other person always tells me they can't hear me. I have to take these out and put my phone on speaker. Other than the mic issue, I love them. I love that I can shower in them.",3,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0

I don't have to blast them and the sound is very full, not tinny, loads of good bass without sounding muddy.  Pairing is a breeze.  I don't use them for calls, so can't comment on that, but if you're looking for something to just play good sounding music of all types, I think you'd be hard pressed to go wrong with these.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0

Loved these except noise cancellation for who I was talking to was nonexistent.  They heard everything in the background. I was walking and even though I wasn’t close to the road multiple people said it sounded like I was right next to a truck rumbling by and it was just a small car.

I got these because I wanted something wireless for my runs. I chose them because of the rave reviews on them not falling out of your ears but I still struggle with this and I have tried every combination of sizes for the ear pieces that come with it.

I would not buy these again nor would I recommend to a friend.,3,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"*UPDATE* They DO NOT stay in my ears during workouts. I can move around with them with no issue, but as soon as I lay down or lift heavy weights, they fall out. Very frustrating.So far I love them!!

I was pretty gentle on them, always putting them back in the charging case, never letting them get wet, etc, but still, they didn't last very long.I guess for $30, what else could you expect? If you need some earbuds with pretty decent sound quality to get you buy for a couple of months, these should work just fine.

The battery life is good, I listen to these all day at work, putting them back in the case when I have to go to a meeting or walk around, etc.  They stay charged and ready all the time.  I used them at the airport and was able to watch a movie while I waiting for my flight and a movie on the plane with no issues.  They connect quickly and the sound quality is excellent in my opinion.",5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
Decent bass with good mid/highs. Case is quite a bit bigger then my older ear buds case from 6 years ago.  Old case would charge and get about 60 hours worth of time.  These I wear for an hour and put them in the case. 3 times of an hour use each and the case is completely dead. Not even close to the advertised times.Ear fit is mediocre even after trying all the various ear buds as they seem bigger then again ear buds from 6 years ago.,2,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"They're great to tune the world out definitely, but the only thing no one mentioned was the "" voice promt Response"" that comes on every time. The voice is a soft speaking feamle voice but it became extremely annoying and theirs no way to disable.  So instead of getting another pair, I just returned them and pony up and got the Samsung earbuds that has a soft ""beep"" instead.  TOZO are very impressive just not for me. PS. I did get 2 of their wirless charger disk and they are so worth it. I can use them on my Samsung Galaxy earbuds and on our iPhone 10.",4,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"I bought 2 pairs of these as Christmas gifts for family members, now both people are reporting that one of the earbuds won’t charge.

"I've used these a couple times so far to do pool workouts with. While the sound quality seems fine, and they stay snug in the ears, I can't do even a full lap in the pool without the bluetooth losing range from my phone. I have a pretty small pool in my yard, and the whole point is to be able to do pool running while listening to podcasts, yet the sound breaks up when I'm only half way down the pool (and I put my phone in the center of the range!). So this is disappointing. I'll probably return them and research for headphones with better range. What's the point if I can't hear anything half the time?",2,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"I was a little skeptical mostly because they're competitors are priced much higher. But these headphones have delivered. I use them when commuting to work on my bike, and can only put one in because they cancel noise so well. The setup initially was SUPER easy, and now they pair automatically whenever I remove them from the case. They sound great, battery life seems awesome, the case is extremely portable and feels durable/well made, and they fit super well. They came with four different ear fittings, two of them actually work pretty well for me and the smallest ones work for my wife who usually has a really hard time with earphones.One thing I've been really impressed with, especially given some other reviews, is the call quality. I cycle to work, it's about an 8-mile commute and my average speed is typically ~20 mph (thanks to the e-bike), which means the wind is whipping and it's a pretty loud commute. In the mornings, I wear a beanie to keep warm, and the beanie totally covers the earphone. The other day, I was on a call from the start of my commute to the end, with beanie on, and the call quality on both sides was flawless. The person I was talking to decided to buy them after the call because she was so impressed with it on her side.",5,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0
"I cannot believe the sound out of these, and they stayed in my ears during a wet, 4 mile run.  Sound quality is better than my Bose Sound Sport, which have the connecting wire on the back of the neck (which tends to grab a wet neck and pull out of your ear when you turn your head).  The Bose also fall out on occasion.  These were so great I turned around and bought my wife a pair!If there is a downside, the buttons only control the phone, so I can't skip or start/stop music.  Also, initially the bass seemed a bit heavy, though I stopped noticing after a while.",5,1,2019-8-17,1,0,0
"These headphones are comfortable to wear. I took my dogs walking/jogging and I did not have any issues with them wanting to fall out. The headphones are loud. Even with my phone set to the lowest volume setting, the headphones are a little too loud for some songs. I love the bluetooth capability. I no longer have to plug my choose between charging my phone or using my old plug in headphones. I no longer have to deal with my headphone cord getting caught on things while I am working or playing with my dogs. The battery life is adequate, but could be a little longer. I use one headphone at a time. I put one in at 6AM and by 1 or 2PM it dies. I wish they would last 12 hours. The one real negative is that the headphones are large and obvious. I assume this is due to the battery size. I do not want less battery capacity, so the larger size is ok. I do not want more battery capacity if it means that the headphones have to get larger. In my opinion, the current size is as large as I would want to go.",5,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0
"I'm honestly shocked by all the positive reviews of this product because it did not work for me at all. The first problem I noticed immediately was that other people can't hear you at all on phone calls/Facetime because the microphone is so quiet. People tell me it sounds like I'm whispering or under water. I even tried to hold one of the earbuds up to my mouth while talking and still, the other person complained that they could barely hear me.Secondly, after just two weeks of having these headphones and using them only a few times, the sound started going in and out. This is very upsetting because while I'm running, I want my music to be continuous and not cut in and out. This even happens sometimes when I'm just stagnant in my house with good connection with my phone in my hand; and it's definitely not my phone because I have a new phone and this occurs with my laptop as well.",2,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"I am happy with these ear buds so far. No-fuss Bluetooth pairing, good sound quality and cancel outside noise. I have very small ear canals, so even the smallest rubber nubby was too big, but I had an xs pair at home, which worked out fine. They stay put for the most part- I use them for running and weight training. I do have to adjust them every so often, but again, this has more to do with my ear shape/size than the product itself. Overall, I’m very happy. Great price and meets my needs.",5,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0
"Such an exceptional product! If I’m being honest my expectations weren’t too high but wow I love these buds. I had to play around with the adjustable plugs to get the right fit but once I found the right size it’s been smooth sailing. I never have to worry about them falling out while I’m walking, lifting, or even running. The music is crisp and clear. I here nothing outside of my music....if someone tries to speak to me I have to take them out. I mainly use them for the gym so the battery life lasts me the entire week. Such a Greta product!

The charging case is great, and I get a lot of playing time out of these, plus at least 4 charges off the case. Easy to use, rarely has issues. If I have problems it's my wi-fi or my bluetooth or my data. If you have trouble getting them to pair, turn them off and then back on after you turn your bluetooth off and then back on.",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0

"I have already bought this and returned it because I could never get one of the earbud to connect through bluetooth to a device. And now when I got the replacement it was working for a few days, then now I have major problems connecting both again, sometimes it takes a few minutes, sometimes I cannot get it to work. I am so frustrated this is a recurring problem. I am debating whether I should return these and get the same model, or a different, since these seem to not work. Other bluetooth devices connect perfectly fine. Would not recommend, only problem is connecting but it is very annoying when only the right side connects and I cannot hear anything from the left despite how much I try.",1,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0

"They have great sound, that's it. The buttons aren't the fingerprint type where you just touch it. So you have to push the button in and it hurts ears to push that hard.

"The earbuds sound great. They pair with my phone fairly well - but not as seamless as I’d prefer. Haven’t taken a phone call with them so can’t speak to that. Sound great overall. My main concern and the reason for my 3 star rating is due to the bluetooth  connectivity. I bought these to use for working out. If I’m just lifting weights or running on a treadmill and my phone is sitting away from my body - the earbuds work great. However, when I took them jogging and had my phone in a pocket the bluetooth connection would continuously cut out. If I turned to look over my right should the connection would cut entirely and would not return until I returned to looking straight. This is terrible and makes them worthless as a jogging earbud.  Never had this problem with my MPOW D7 headphones. Likely returning these.",3,1,2019-4-12,1,0,0

I own a couple of these ear buds and as for quality of them I couldn't be happier. Battery life is exceptional and sound is great. I did have one problem with a purchase. I ear bud didn't work. I contacted the company that made them and they sent me a replacement  one out right away. I received  it in around 7-10 days i believe.  They even contacted me again to make sure I recieved  it and I was satisfied. Best customer  service hands down. I would highly recommend  these ear buds.,5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"I love the way these headphones sound! Not having a connecting wire between them takes out the frustration of earbuds getting yanked out. The battery life is about four hours, and they seem to charge quickly in the case in your pocket between uses. I work in a loud machine shop, and they do a great job noise cancelling even if they're off. I constantly have to reposition or catch most headphones as they're falling out, but right out of the box, these almost never fall out (even when wet)! I took a chance on a brand I was unfamiliar with, and TOZO has absolutely proven itself.",5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,1

"The sound on these is fairly good, though bass is so exaggerated it can overpower other parts of a song. I imagine some people may prefer that.

My roommate said he had tried scaring me by banging really hard and loud, but I literally only heard the song I was listening to at the time on a safe medium volume.

"I have had these for a little more than a month and overall am pretty pleased. The two issues I do have are the earbud not disconnecting correctly and the low battery warning. The first issue just started fairly recently. I wear these to work and I am only allowed to wear one at a time it worked well that when one was low on battery the other one would be charged and ready to go. When I would put the low battery one in the case it would automatically disconnect and then other one would connect when I pulled it out. However recently they are not disconnecting right I would have the second one connected and listening to it when all of a sudden I hear 2nd device connected and the earbud I am using disconnects. I then have to go to manually disconnect the earbuds through my phone and then reconnect the earbud I want to use. Sometimes I have to repeatedly select disconnect and put the earbud in and out of the case before I am connected correctly. The second issue is the low battery warning which starts about a minute before it dies. I keep my bag with the case in one place while I work around a conveyor. When I get the warning I don’t even get to finish the round I am working on before it dies. One full round takes about 5 minutes, if my earbud would last that long till I get back to my case that would be great. The sound quality is great though and I will continue to use them.",3,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"I love these! They were easy to setup. The sound quality is great. It came with extra earbuds in the pack that actually for my small ears. They are really noise cancelling, light weight, and are TRULY WIRELESS!!!! Most importantly, they stay put when I am poling. I pole dance and sometimes I worry about disrupting my neighbors with the music I play so I default to poling with headphones. Needless to say, it's a bad idea to invert and spin with headphones on, but of course I got caught up in choreography and my last pair was tossed clear off my head and damaged. These passed my poling test! It should be perfect for anyone who exercises with lots of body movement or running. Plus it comes with a free 1 year warranty from the seller! Awesome!!!!",5,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
Left earbud would loose connection from time to time but would easily reconnect. Had to send product back after left earbud suddenly lost power and would not turn back on. Attempted to charge and retry but it would never power in again. Luckily still in 30 day window so I'll be returning.**Update 8/2/20 TOZO sent me a new pair (updated model T12) for free after my return. These are working perfectly and seem to work much better than the other ones before they stopped working. I'm updating to five stars for they're wonderful customer service.

"The talk quality is a lot better than LG’s retractable earbuds HBS series, but it has its own flaws.  It might work better with just one channel, but I’m not complaining.  The Bass is unbelievable.  I experienced a problem where I had to re-pair my buds after a phone call, but that may have been because I had my old broken LG headset still on and paired—not complaining, about this product anyways.  For $50 they’re a great value and I’m sure they last longer than my old over-priced LG headsets that always had a problem with one channel dying because of a short in the electrical wire developed after some time of retracting and pulling the earbuds from the headset.",5,1,2019-4-12,1,0,0
"These are the most versatile earbuds I've owned. Very practical that the case is a charger. I have lost two wired headphones and one wired Bluetooth headphones because the wire snagged and fell. These fit comfortably with the choice of 4 earbud sizes. The charge lasts for over an hour and half at minimum and it has great noise reduction. The sound quality is very good and can be loud without distortion when the volume is full. The Bluetooth range is fine for biking whether my phone is in my pocket or fitted on the handlebars. I have not tested that it is waterproof, but riding in the rain has not been an issue. They are comfortable and sleek. I am very satisfied with these earbuds that were at half the cost of my Klipsch wired headphones or my ISOtunes Bluetooth headphones.

I fly frequently, and these do a decent job of blocking loud airplane noise.  I have three different devices I regularly pair with, and it isn't hard to switch between devices.  You just need to put the right headphone in the case for a moment to break the pairing and re-pair.  I haven't actually timed the battery life, but it probably lasts about 2-3 hours before they need to be placed back in the case to recharge.

"I had purchased these buds because I was in a pinch. Being a maintenance man for properties I deal with plumbing and that includes water... well, my phone took a bath. This left my microphone inoperable. Instead of replacing my phone that works fine other than the microphone I rely on bluetooth. I had a nice LG JBL set but being over 6 years old they quit... So, I purchased these. Not as expensive and do the job. These new style buds are iffy for the fact they are just that buds. No cables, nothing to restrain them from getting lost. You rely on the product and your ears to hold them in. Sound quality is good for what they are. You may want to download a sound equalizer app if your looking to get better quality. For me, they work good without. Microphone wise, I have had no issues. Unless, if your like my sister and relies on her car audio for calls, good luck. She said I sounded really quiet during our conversation. Nothing that can really be done about that. Noise cancellation, still can hear the environment around you just muffled. It all depends on your preference really. I do like the waterproof aspect. Being that I do work outside quite frequently it's a nice feature. They also come with a one year warranty.",5,1,2019-6-12,1,0,0
Had these a few weeks. Battery life seems good. Can’t hear when people talk to me while I’m listening to music so that’s good.

The sound quality is way better than the old LG bluetooth headset I had and they stay in my ear well enough as long as I'm not doing anything crazy. They come with 4 different size earpieces.

The wireless signal lasts a good distance and doesn’t lose signal at all.The only cons I can see so far is battery life is only about 4 hours and it feels like the battery life on the charging case decreased after only a few months of use. It still can fully charge the headphones 2 or so times but it’s not as strong as it was when I first got it. Overall they are pretty good for the prices.,4,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"Connection is poor quality at best...just brushing by the earbuds will interrupt the signal and it's repeatable and consistent. All the while the device that it's connected to is literally right next to the earbuds.Connection cuts in and out within just 10 feet or so, and forget it if you go around a corner without the connecting device.",1,1,2019-6-6,1,1,0
"Love the headphones, stay in my ear better than AirPods. Battery life on the headphones is solid, I’ve never used them long enough to drain them completely. Clear sound easy pairing.Unfortunately, the charging case stopped holding a charge (which does not appear to be a common issue) And the headphones don’t charge properly now.",4,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
Update 10/25/19: the one problem I have which I dont mind for the cost. Is that sometime it turns on while in the case and pairs up with my phone when I dont need it.The best bluetooth for great price! I love it I has to YouTube the instructions on how to used them. Also if you plan to use one of them it is best to use the right one since it is the dominant one. I would highly recommend it to anyone even family and friends for the price I am definitely happy with these bluetooth buds.  You can answer calls on the as well.,4,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"My 15 year old son bought these earbuds with his own money. The right earbud with the first pair stopped working within the first week. We returned and were impressed by how fast Amazon replaced them. It was the very next day! Fantastic. However, the next set only last 4 weeks. Left earbud will only connect to his phone and not to the right earbud. My son has taken very good care of these (happens when they use there own money, right?). So disappointed in this product and a waste of his hard earned $40. Don't waste your money.",2,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"Headphones have good, detailed mid-range and treble,  but the bass is very weak.  I listened to Jazz, Hip-hop and Rock and all had the anemic bass. These may be great for phone calls and the spoken word, but the missing base really takes away from listening to music.  Can't be too disappointed with the $40 cost, but like the Oontz blue tooth speaker, you really need to be wary of the 5 star reviews of this set of buds. Amazon reviews for sound quality are always questionable.",3,1,2020-3-29,1,0,0
"So far I’m quite impressed with these. I was using cheap wired headphones before and I had no idea the sound quality I was missing, considering these barely costed me more and they’re wireless! I’ve always been scared of wireless because my ears are tiny and headphones don’t stay in them well but these stay in perfectly when jumping and running and all. I haven’t tested out the noise cancellation yet but I’m thinking that feature will be great too judging by the sound of when I put them in. Only thing I wish it had is the ability to skip to the next song! It lets you pause/play and answer phones but you can’t skip songs. I knew this when I bought them though and still thought these were the best option and I’m pleased with my choice!",5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
"I was skeptical and compared reviews from this Tozo T10 to the Samsung Earbuds and the reviews were pretty similar.  So I thought I would try the $50 risk instead of the $130 risk.

I've only had them for a few days, so I will update if things change.Pros:",4,1,2019-9-26,1,0,0
"These are fantastic and saved me from spending high dollar on gimmicky brand name earbuds. I was skeptical at first when reading all the reviews it seemed people were rating these on the lower star scale for no commands via earbuds to access phone functions like turning down sound, skipping songs and taking calls but I will tell all of you that is not the case. These earbuds do have all the functionality of most other buds however when i got these it was not immediately apparent to me that these are TOUCH sensitive. It's a learning experience to get these notions down on how to communicate functions to your phone but it's super handy! I love these buds. They have amazing sound quality, they pair super easy and fast I also love the fact its voice and you also have the full ability to activate 1 bud at a time even when the entire set is paired to the phone so I can use them comfortably at work with just one in my ear. I've used amazon for literally every purchase in any category and this one is by far my favorite one to this day. I feel like I just spent $30 on a pair of $150 buds. Thanks TOZO!",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
I have tried several different wireless earbuds over the past few months and could not find anything that 1- fit comfortably in my ears. 2- had enough battery life to make it through the workday 3- that I could wear just one earbud at a time.  It was a task finding a wireless bluetooth headset that didn't hurt my ears.  I was about to just get over the whole wanting earbuds thing.  Then I decided ok last-ditch effort I would buy the Tozo earbuds.  I am so glad that I did!  I did have to use the smallest ear covers provided but so far so good.  They are a little big if you have small ears but with my hair down no one can even notice.  Ive been using the left bud in my ear since 8 am...its now 1:42 and its going strong!  :),4,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0

I read the reviews and dove in as my wired earbuds died on me and my Beats headphones are too bulky. I didn't expect this kind of sound quality this made due to the price but these are the best wireless earbuds for your hard earned money! Don't sleep on this product if you are budget conscious but a quality product nerd. I'd have to get another one in a different color as my backup! I actually put away my Beats headphones for these!

"I've had these since October 2019. I fell in love with them immediately: noise cancellation is incredible, sound is crisp, battery life is great, recharging base is great. Then, a few weeks ago, the sound became choppy if I wasn't in direct line of sight from my phone; even turning my head would cause issues. This is irritating, but it's not the worst thing in the world. Then I had them connected to my laptop today for a video call which I've done countless times before. I thought the other people's internet connections were bad because the sound cut in and out, but suddenly wondered if it was the suspected bluetooth connection issue and disconnected the earbuds. It was, indeed, the bluetooth connection. So, I've ordered a new set from a different brand and am disappointed because everything else about these is fantastic.",3,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
Great sounds quality and super insanely easy pairing! Also the different sized earpieces are perfect and allowed me to really feel like the headphones fit my ears. The wireless charging of the base works real well and is super convenient. Not completely noise canceling but does a pretty great job especially for the price. 10/10 would recommend to someone looking for some nice truly wireless headphones and not looking to break the bank at the same time.,5,1,2020-6-2,1,0,1
I've purchased several different types of wireless earbuds and didn't have any success. I found this online as I'm browsing and figured I'd give it a try. It paired very quickly with my phone and was working immediately. I'm shocked that it also had a full battery life already so I didn't have to charge it before using it. The touch system is awesome. I got worried for a second when it kept the music kept pausing before I realized it was touch sensitive whereas previous purchases you had to push harder to pause and play. I have a Google pixel phone and always had an Android phone so I was a little upset seeing so many people using the Apple airpods. I honestly couldn't understand how good those good have been until I tried these earbuds. I have yet to try to voice activation but the use and noise cancelling of them is enough for me to be happy.,5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,1
"These worked great for 3 months. Now the left side won't hold a charge or play at all. I have taken care of them and followed all instructions. I never even got them wet even though it is claimed they are ""waterproof.""  I even keep them in the case when they are not in my ear.  But they are $40 not $200.  I missed my return window unfortunately. I don't remember if a warranty was offered, but you might consider it if offered at a low price.  But I would hope this is just a defect in my set and not a defect in them all.",3,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0

"I've had these headphones since November and they have been working great for me. Although they are now no longer charging. I am currently in touch with support and they have been really quick to respond to my concerns and are in the process of sending me a replacement for free. So, even if your headphones go bad, you can get a new one easily. The one thing that I do not like about the headphones is that double tap places a call instead of skipping to the next track on most other headphones I have used. I have accidentally called people many times because of this.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"Have had these a little over a month. First thing I will say is that for the price, they are a good buy. Sound quality is nice, good noise cancelation, and sharp look/design.

"My 22 year old daughter ""misplaced"" my previous pair of blue tooth earbuds so I had to buy a new ones. I got on Amazon and started looking around and found these. They looked cool, were in my price range and had received a lot of great reviews so I bought them. I'm embarrassed to say that I didn't really read much about them before I purchased them. Just another one of my many impulse buys. LOL! When I received the buds and started reading about them I was floored. They're WATERPROOF! That's insane! I haven't tried them in the shower yet, though, so I can't give you a review on how well they work in water. The carrying case is very solid and it needs to be because its' also the charger for the ear buds. You DO have to keep the case charged with a USB but when you need the buds charged you simply place them back in the case and whamo. Way cool! I've not had any problems with the buds moving around or falling out of my ears. Just follow their advice on sizing. Also, way cool! But the best feature is THEY SOUND AWESOME! I'm not an expert on stereo or sound equipment but I know what I like and I LOVE these. Buy them! You won't be sorry.",5,1,2018-12-26,1,1,0
"I've been on the hunt for a quality pair of wireless earbuds for some time now, but I also didn't want to shell out a few hundred dollars to buy the name brand ones. I was looking through the Amazon selections and came across The TOZO T10. It has all of the features that I was looking for as well as being truly wireless. I can't tell you the amount of times I've accidentally pulled an earbud from my ear while trying to listen to music or watch TV on my laptop. Anyways, the budget price really sold me. I figured if they ended up being bad, I wouldn't be out a hundred dollars or more. They finally arrived today and they work great right out of the box. Mine came fully charged so I was able to pair it up to my devices and get them working right away. I love the sound quality. It has just the right amount of noise cancellation for me, where you can't hear distracting noises, but can still hear if someone was yelling for help or not. So far so good!",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
I could never find comfortable earbuds so always wore the sports type that is wired and hooks over your ears.  Well recently my iPhone died and I found that the newer iPhones only accept wireless headphones.  After spending several days reading review after review I decided to give this pair a try. I was impressed that it came with different sized earpieces. I thought this would give me a better chance of finding a secure and comfortable set of earbuds. I was right!From the moment I inserted them they were comfortable!  I listen to Audible books as I go about my day.  No matter what activity I am doing the earbuds stay right where they belong.  I couldn't be happier!  You absolutely should give the TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds a try.  You won't be sorry.,5,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0
"When I was searching for a set of wireless bluetooth earbuds, TOZO's T10 product stood out to me. I didn't really know what I was looking for but these earbuds seemed to have everything that I could have wanted and more. So I bought them. This product meets my needs and exceeds all of my expectations. I don't typically have so much time in the day that I am able to use them for long amounts of time, but the times that I need them to last for several hours, the battery life holds strong and I have no issues with needing to recharge before I'm done using them. The noise cancellation on this product is astounding. Very recently, the right earbud died and wouldn't charge anymore. After speaking with customer support and trying all of their recommendations without success, they are sending me a new set at no cost to me. I couldn't be happier with their willingness to work with me and replace their product. It makes me believe that this issue is not a common one. If you're looking for a set of wireless bluetooth earbuds with a great sound quality, a strong battery life, and an unearthly ability to cancel external noise, then look no further.",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"I have had these headphones for about a week and a half and I have used them every single day. It is really nice coming from using wire headphones to a truly wireless pair of headphones. I have not had any difficulty getting these headphones to connect and the battery life has been pretty decent. The charging case is really nice! My favorite part is the magnetic closure. The only thing that I can even think to give criticism on is the sound quality. I find that the sound quality is really good up to about halfway turned up. If I turn it up any louder it is really sharp and crisp sounding and hurts my ears. This hasn’t really been an issue for me because using half volume has been loud enough. Other than that, I have really enjoyed these ear pods and would recommend them to others - especially given the affordability!Update 7/27/2020:",1,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0

I had to use the smallest sized pods for my ears and I almost wished there was one size smaller. However, they do fit. Sometimes I really have to push them in there to stay (and I had to read the directions/watch the video on correct orientation/insertion). But, they haven't fallen out while biking or walking. I'll try running at some point. Excellent sound quality! I also love how they magnetically stay in their charging station. So far, great product for the price.",4,1,2019-6-11,1,1,0
"I had a pair of expensive Bose ear buds and lost one at work, I paid a lot of money for them and was quite mad so I started looking for a new pair for work that wouldn’t cost a ton of money so I stumbled onto these Tozo’s and every review was excellent and nobody had anything bad to say about them so I went on YouTube and watch a couple reviews and they had all positive comments about these air buds. I like the fact that you get over five hours of listening off of one single charge and you can actually use either the left or the right if you can only use one and they both work without the other. The comfort of the buds are really good also and fit my ears really well. I use them every day at work and I’m completely satisfied and I tell my friends and coworkers about them also.",5,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0

Has volume control, double tap to skip current song unlike this model. The only downside is they are sensitive. If you try to adjust the ear bud you may accidentally pause the song, but otherwise they are great! 5-6 hours of battery life, so much improved as compared to the T10 model",4,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"My Bose wireless died after only a year, so I wanted something more affordable. Paid $44.99 (with a $5 coupon) plus tax thinking that its sound quality would be at least decent. Wrong!! I am shocked that this has so many great reviews. I bought this for the gym, and I listen to mostly hip hop. Every song sounded as bad as those produced by a free wireless headphone I received at a conference. To add insult to injury, I noticed that the price for this bugger was reduced to twenty-something around Black Friday. The fit is very comfortable, and it is certainly worth around $25. Anything over $30 is highway robbery. A hard pass. I gave it an extra star because it is comfortable to wear. I have bought another pair based on more research and am waiting for its arrival as I type this.",2,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"These earbuds are great!! I ordered them on Thursday and they told me they would arrive by Saturday. I get home from work on Friday and there they are! A very nice surprise to see them a day earlier than expected. The sound quality is really good, especially for the price. When I'm wearing them properly, the noise cancellation is wonderful! I can't hear anything else around me. My wife and I both tested them out to see how well they stay in your ear once you find the right size earpiece, since they come with 4 different sizes. These suckers aren't going anywhere! They are perfect for a good session at the gym. The charging case is a great addition! You can see the charging indication lights through the case when it's closed. The case is small and most definitely travel friendly. It doesn't get in the way of anything at all! The battery life of both the case and the earbuds are much better than I expected. Normally when I get a pair of wireless headphones/earbuds, the battery life is quite disappointing. Not with these! The case charges them fast and they last for exactly how long I need them for and even longer! It doesn't take very long for the case to charge up as well, which is a huge plus.The only thing I was iffy about while purchasing these was that I was thinking they would be bulky while they're in your ears and they would stick out far. It's not that bad at all. Much better than I anticipated.",5,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0
"I'll admit I rely on reviews pretty heavily when considering an Amazon purchase. So when I found myself on the market for a pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds, I was immediately drawn to these. Lots of reviews and (at the time) four and a half stars. That grabs your attention. This device had everything I was looking for. What I wasn't aware of at the time is that this company offers a free wireless charging station to those that purchase their product and leave a five star review. I have to say that is an extremely dubious way of inflating your positive five-star reviews. So don't be like me and rely too heavily on these reviews.Having said that, I like the product a lot. They're great. They're comfortable. The sound is awesome. I haven't had them long enough to test the battery life, but so far, great.

It sounds just like it should and the bass hits you. They have many different tips and would definitely fit your ears, and would stay. I don’t have a wireless charger but if you do I feel like these could be amazing for everyday use. I would use them to go to school and talk to my friends at home. I’ve used these for a day and they have as much connection as I would need, perfect sound, and the battery life doesn’t really affect me. People say you can only use one at a time but you can personally connect the left or right and use it by itself and that’s exactly how I use earbuds. I would be more than happy to make a video on these or any other product tozo would want. (Just email me lol) and if you are thinking of buying these, I really think you should. PS wireless earbuds are good for online school. When you have your phone, you get distracted and don’t do as good in school.

"The sound on these is very nice for bluetooth, and the earbuds fit comfortably and securely. I use these on my bike rides and have no issue with them coming loose. The problem is that the connection will drop on and off, sometimes dozens if not hundreds of times during a ride (over a time of an hour or two). Overall this only adds up to a few minutes of dropped time total since each drop is only for a few seconds. I haven't been able to pinpoint what causes it. It seems to sometimes coincide with my leg movement (in my pocket as I'm biking) but I don't think that would matter for a bluetooth connection. I don't know if it's my phone, or the earbuds, but I suspect the latter because other people have had similar issues and because if I use my phone's bluetooth in my car I never experience any similar drops. This isn't a huge deal; it's only a few seconds at a time. Still, it can sometimes be very annoying if I'm trying to enjoy a song or listening to a podcast or whatever it may be. The drops are what make me give the earbuds 4 stars instead of 5.",4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0

The overall quality of the earbuds and the charging case is fantastic.  Looks very well made, but the electronics is severely lacking.

The Bluetooth connectivity works great and so far the battery life seems good. I jsut wish I didn't have to press so hard to pause music.

These are GREAT sounding earbuds with powerful base. The battery life however is only 3 - 3.5 hours for me. I wish the battery life lasted longer but I have to be realistic seeing as how small these earbuds are you can only squeeze so much into a package so small. Bluetooth connectivity is seamless. Always connect to my iPhone 8+ with no issues. I love how they are magnetic to the base and snap right into place when you drop them in. Dollar for dollar these are much better than other earbuds that are way more expensive. I would recommend these to friends and family.,5,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0

It started doing this a couple of months ago and I had thought it was because I had my phone in my back pocket instead of the front.",4,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
I’ve still been using wired headset on my phone and tablet till i bought my first wireless earbuds. First real world test is when I was cutting my grass. I used to run the wires on my wired heaadset under my shirt so it won’t get in my way but this T10 (and just about any other true wireless earbuds out there) is a game changer! I don’t have to fumble around with wires and the T10 didn’t fall off my ears as I was mowing the lawn. The IPX8 waterproof is also a plus since it’s been really humid here in MI and I do sweat alot! :) I just need to remember that I’m using a wireless earbuds since I tend to just pull the wired earbuds off my ear and never worry about it falling. I did accidentally took the T10 off my ear w/o knowing that it doesn’t have wires anymore so I was looking around the ground for it for awhile! Haha! Noise isolation is decent and the sound from the lawn mower engine was good enough! All in all a great purchase from Tozo for the price and functionality! Hopefully their warranty service is as good as they say. Wouln’d hesitate to buy from this company again!,5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,1
"I just got them and haven’t really used them outside the house, but noise cancellation is great. I turned my tv all the way up and I could barely hear it and the headphones weren’t even turned up all the way. They get very loud and I’m someone who blast music LOUD when I work out. I’m having a little trouble keeping the right one in but i’ll keep messing with it since the left one fits so well. So far im very happy with my purchase , especially since I was about to buy $150 Samsung earbuds.",4,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"Sound quality is excellent.  Battery life is average.  Size is a bit bulky (a little Frankenstein's monster-ish).  Fit is maybe a little above average, i.e. they don't fall out of my ears but do get a little uncomfortable after extended use.  My main issue is the lack of any controls from the earbuds other than play/pause (and redialing the last phone number with a double-tap).  I really wish this was a more common feature as it doesn't require more than 1 button per earbud (just requires multiple taps).  Granted, I realize you can't have total control this way, but it's a significant advantage at the gym, while taking walks, doing chores around the house, etc. to not have to take out my phone just to nudge the volume up or down, or quickly rewind a podcast or audiobook for that last bit my brain was too distracted to hear (or fast-forward past a commercial).  I guess wireless earbuds are a relatively new technology, and I'm still waiting for a pair with these features that also last longer than a few months before failing.  I'll update if these break down in short order as well, though they will likely serve mostly as a backup.",3,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
These buds are NO JOKE!  I am blown away at the sound. The bass really is rich and clear.  The treble could increased a little more but that is minor compared to the sound these things pump out!Battery life is sufficient especially with the case being a backup charger.,5,1,2019-2-1,1,0,0
Ordered this and got it shipped bthe next day with my Amazon Prime. I came across an ad on my Instagram advertising this product through a phony scam company called CoffeTabla.com ....I thank God I didn't give them my credit card information after doing some research on this company.,4,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"These sound great but did have a few flaws... the main plastic part was too wide to fit comfortably in the ear, despite swapping the size of the little cover that goes into the ear. They also don’t work great on phone calls and would cut out, the microphone didn’t seem to pick up well which was frustrating bc people could not hear and I’d have to just use the phone not earbuds. Also while listening to music, the left earbud would you randomly disconnect/just stop working. The right one did not do this, so thinking this was a defect, so returned these and got the tozo 6 model which are much better so far!",3,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0
"Like most of you I have several pairs of earbuds, both wired and wireless, and seem to have something I really like and dislike about each.  The things I like about the T10s- Great sound quality- I think they sound better than by Bose SoundSport earbuds.  Very nice frequency range with clear tones from the highs to the lows.  They are more comfortable than most of my other ear buds, and seem to stay in place well during activities.My main dislike- they are not user friendly when it comes to switching between devices.  I am paired with my computer, work phone and personal phone.  I switch between the three on a regular basis, and the only way I can go between the three is to turn the Bluetooth off on the devices I am not using and connecting to the one I want to use.  I wish there was a way to push one of the earbud buttons and scroll through the connected devices until I was connected to the one I want to use.  Until that happens these will remain my back-up, evening/weekend buds and will continue using Bose for workday wear.",4,1,2020-10-5,1,0,0
I am not the most electronic person. I admit I might not know how to put these to make them work and cancel out sound. I tried all the sizes and ended up with the largest one so it doesn't fall out. They don't cancel out sound for me. But again I might be getting it wrong. I still love them. They are very cute. I got the bronze color. Battery last a great deal! I am very pleased I choose them over all the reviews I read.,5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"The Tozo T10 earbuds are the best ones ive had the pleasure of trying, as they are comfy and very noise cancelling which allow me to get work done better. The wireless feature alone is amazing, as i never realized how much this was needed in my life. Additionally, they charge with the wireless charger and last me for days. I love working out with them since they stay in your ears and they are stylish, to top it off. Their customer service is phenomenal and i found my emails answered very quickly as well as them being very courteous and attentive to my inquiries. I suggest that you give them a try, since the price point is affordable for most.",5,1,2019-11-18,1,1,0
"First off, the fit, feel, quality and sound was really nice.I think these may be great if you are stationary, or at least not walking with your phone in your pocket.  Streaming music would cut in and out constantly.  Thought maybe it was because of streaming and tried songs stored on my phone and it also cut in and out.  Un-paired, re-paired, restarted phone to no avail.  Not walking they were great.  Had to return because I use headphones mostly when I am walking.  Otherwise I would have kept them.",3,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"Initial Overall Rating: 1/5 on Sep 18, 2020. The right side ear bud stopped working. Without it, the left side does not connect, rendering the product completely unusable.

I will update my review based on how the replacement part performs.",3,1,2020-9-18,1,1,0

"I have owned a couple pairs of competing wireless earbuds and I can say, unequivocally, that these blow all other competitors away!  The overall sound is very rich and immersive and you get plenty of bass (something that these other earbuds seem to lack).  I did my bass test by listening to Soundgarden’s 4th of July through these – a test I’ve been doing on each new pair of headphones and earbuds since Superunknown came out in 1994.  I owned a pair of Koss can-style headphones back in the 90’s that were PERFECT and scored the best with my 4th of July test.  The sound was very rich, the bass rumbled, making it seem as though the ground was shaking even though you were only wearing headphones and there was no noise outside of them.  The overall sound was amazing and I’ve been trying to get that sound back ever since.  I’ve owned all varieties of headphones, wired and wireless earbuds, etc, over the years, and have never been able to capture the sound quality that my Koss headphones had – that is, until I got my Tozo T10’s.  They sound so good that all my other earbuds now sound thin and tinny in comparison.  I’m a musician and I used to listen to music all the time.  For about a year now, I’ve barely listened to anything; I lost my interest or something, I’m not sure what the reason.  Now that I have my T10’s, I can’t stop listening!  The music just sounds so good and I’m so happy!!  It’s like my old self is back!  Thank you, Tozo!!A quick note:  when I got my T10’s I had an issue where the right earbud wouldn’t turn off when it was dropped into the case or when I pressed and held the button on the earbud itself.  I contacted the company and, after a little bit of troubleshooting, it was determined that the right earbud needed to be replaced.  They shipped me a new right earbud and now everything is working perfectly!",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"Worked just fine with my phone (Samsung S10+) and my PC.  I can hear myself breathe sometimes, but I'm assuming that's just a normal thing (first earbuds I've ever used).  The sound is great and they are completely comfortable.  The only odd bit is that it will NOT wirelessly charge using the wireless charger I use for my phone.  It gives no indication that it can wirelessly charge at all, no matter where I put it on the charger.  It does charge just fine using the included USB cable though.  Weird.  The manual could be improved by explaining what the four blue charging lights in the case mean.",4,1,2019-5-7,1,0,0
"I have read through hundreds of reviews of ear pods/buds/phones in search of a pair of bluetooth earbuds that were under $100 and provided solid sound. I'm not an audiophile, but I'm on the phone a lot handling phone calls. So, I also needed the set to be comfortable for long periods of time and for the mic to be crisp for those I was communicating with. After reading thousands of comments, I finally realized that no one is ever going to be 100% satisfied with any set. So, I followed Amazon's advice and bought this pair. It was only $50, so I could always regift them if I didn't like them ;) It turns out these are an incredible buy for the money. I received them on Oct. 30th and there hasn't been a day gone by that they haven't been in my ears. While the set does come with different sizes of ear caps, the original set worked well for me. I listen to Audible a lot when I'm driving, and the sound has been perfect. So far, zero complaints from me!",5,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0
"As the title suggests, when I first received these, I had significant pairing and sync issues with the earbuds. I wear these almost exclusively for running, and my first run with them, the left earbud would cut out constantly, followed by the right earbud.I managed to fix the issue, however, with a proper reset of the earbuds. There's a particular process that you must follow exactly:",4,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"These head phones are excellent! I am extremely happy with my purchase and hope to have these for quite awhile. The only thing I’ve noticed, which is extremely specific, is that if you already have them connected to the phone, and go to place them in the case with the case being almost out of charge, then connect your phone to a different Bluetooth device (for me that is an fm transmitter), once the case battery dies the headphones will act as if they have been pulled out of the case and connect to the phone again, forcing me to reselect the other device. But seeing as that is so specific, it has no negative bearing on my view of this product. The sound quality is excellent for the price(not “true flat” but nice), I’m a music recording tech, so I know good sound quality.The noise cancelling works perfectly. And even though I was worried that these would have problems staying in my ear, I was proven wrong and am not even the least bit concerned about them falling out unless I’m head banging to some death metal!",5,1,2019-7-10,1,1,0
"I’ve not had these long enough to judge battery life but the sound quality is fantastic for this price point. I have always been a fan of higher end plugs like Westtone and Shure. But my older ears are hard pressed to find any glaring differences in sound. But there is one thing that I consider a design flaw and that is the lack of music control via the buttons.  I can work around it using Siri, but it was just so unexpected in any ear bud in today’s environment that I deducted a star for it.",4,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"I would say, I have tried more than 10 true wireless earbuds but this one is one of best under I would say $99 range. I only paid $45 with the promo code and got IPX 8 waterproof earbuds. The only one thing I am not satisfied is the sound quality. Well maybe to me I don’t like too much bass but they have powerful and strong bass if you like. Other than that I have nothing to complain with these earbuds! $45 for them, what else you wanna expect? Of course sounds quality is not as good as jabra or bose or Sony but they are $200 range. I love mine",5,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0
"I was always skeptical about buying these Bluetooth headphones because of the ease of losing them. You just have to be careful and mindful of what you do with them. I've had these earbuds for over 90 days now and I do not have any issues.I had read online that most earbuds are high treble and that wouldn't suit my tastes. But these definitely have bass boosted nicely, without making conversation unclear.",5,1,2019-9-1,1,1,0
Pros: Wireless charging is great.Connects quickly to everything.,3,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"Overall, these are a decent pair of earbuds.  My biggest problem is they do seem to have a sensitive bluetooth connection.  When my phone is in any pocket, it has waves of spotty connection.  Usually it is ok, but if it skips once, it will usually continue skipping for about 30 seconds.  I mostly use these for the gym as my wired pair just gets in the way, and they work great for that.  However, when I'm at the gym, my phone is not in my pocket, but 20 - 30 feet away on a table.  It really seems like the pockets create way more interference than you would think.  A couple other things that could be bothersome:- You can't have one earbud turned off or it will constantly beep until you turn it back on",3,1,2019-5-15,1,1,0
"I love these earbuds!  I have had them for about a month now and they are so easy to use.  I was able to pick the correct size ear pieces and pair them to my phone right away.  The sound quality is fantastic and definitely cancels out noise really well.  I use them on the train to work and at work.  It's nice to be able to listen without dealing with any cords and accidentally yanking them out.  They fit nicely in my ears and have not fallen out so far.  I really like that they are water proof as well.  That's a big bonus. Overall this is a great product and I even got a pair for my mother in law, who also loves them!",5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0
"These earbuds are by far some of the best ones you can get for the money. The sound quality is near perfect and I use them a good majority of the time to watch anime or other shows, especially if my wife is watching something on Netflix that I'm not interested in. I listening to music virtually every day while moving between jobsites since there is no radios in the work trucks. I can usually get anywhere from 4 to 5 days of battery life between having to charge the portable charging case. To the best of my knowledge these are 100% water resistant, not sure if fully waterproof or not because I haven't attempted to use them in the shower. The only aggravating thing I have found with these is if you only have 1 earbud in, making phone calls for instance, you have to put the earbud back in the charging case and remove both earbuds at the same time if you want to go from 1 to 2 earbuds. Other than that there is nothing else I can find that is any issues. I would highly recommend these over the more expensive brands because you're getting almost the same exact quality.",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
These earbuds are excellent quality for the price.  My biggest concern in purchasing these was the microphone quality as I will be using them to take and place phone calls.  In my conversations with others they say the sound is as if I were holding the phone to my ear and they also cancel out background noise fairly well.  The sound quality for listening to music is great as well.  Only issue I have had is getting them to pair properly (not often) but this issue is easily fixed by turning the earbuds off and back on.  The issue typically happens when switching from one device to another.,5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"I wish I could give this product 5 stars. As a musician, audio engineer and rockaholic, the sound quality is on point.The bad thing about these is when I try to workout, they keep falling out of my ears. I even swapped our the rubber ear pieces It comes with to my old earbud pieces and it still happens. The bulky design might be the cause since they don’t fit in your ear like an in ear monitor. If the company pushed out an in ear monitor design, I’d give it 5 stars all day.",3,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"I wear these all the time, I do have adjust them ever so often, but not so much that it's a problem.  I love that I can either be talking on the phone or listening to music and keep on doing so while stepping into the shower, yes, I have done this multiple times and been able to carry on conversation with little issue talking over the water.  They will stick out a little, compared to some brands. but at this price point you really can't go wrong.  Would recommend and buy again myself.",5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
"Just filled out the form to have these returned and I’m going to try my luck with a second pair. They were great headphones. Stayed in place well while running and cutting grass. However, after a couple weeks of occasional use the case is no longer charging and the headphones are dead with no way to charge them. Very disappointed with the item because they seemed very promising for the price. We’ll see how the next pair does and update the review.",1,1,2020-3-27,1,1,0
"The idea of ""truly wireless"" ear buds is still pretty new, but these are still surprisingly excellent. The sound quality is great - I didn't expect this amount of bass to come from such tiny things - and the compact charging case fits in every pocket I have.The range is - comparing them to other wireless ear buds I've bought (string across the back ones) - just absurd. I've left my phone in the house, went out for a smoke and they still worked. Previous examples would cut out if I went from the kitchen to the next room because the fridge was in the way. I've even lost my phone despite listening to it before. I can't praise the range of these tiny things enough.",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
These things are awesome!  I didn't think I would enjoy them as much as I do.  I used them for working out but also started bringing them to work.  I can just use one at a time so it allows me to listen to my music but still hear and talk with people around me.  Kind of like the normal bluetooth you use with your cell phone but less obvious.  The sound quality is great!  Charges fast and I like the wireless charging.  So you just put the case with the buds on it and it just charges!  Not bad for something that is less than $50!,5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"I really wanted to like these headphones.  Out of the box they worked okay.  Even with the smallest earbud option, they popped out of my ears a lot and had to be frequently readjusted.  The sound quality was really good, but the volume was really loud.  When you tried to adjust volume they would go from no sound, to very loud.  There was no in between.Then a few weeks after I got them all of a sudden the earbuds wouldn’t pair with each other.  I tried using their troubleshooting guide and at one point the right earbud turned off and I couldn’t get it to turn back on.  I tried plugging it into the charger and the charger wouldn’t recognize it.  I contacted the company and they answered me within a few hours with more troubleshooting ideas.  I was able to get the right earbud turned back on, but it wouldn’t pair with the left one.  During the troubleshooting process, the right one turned itself off again and I had the same trouble I began with.",1,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"I bought these based on the many many reviews. For the price point of these earbuds they are so far great. Unpacking and pairing was simple and easy to do. They have good noise canceling ability - to the point where I could see my friend talking across the table from me but not really hear her. I was pleasantly surprised by the control functions on the earbuds themselves - including accepting/declining calls, redialing someone, and play/pause function for music. Note: you can only control the volume from paired devise.Based on my initial impression I give this product 5 stars. Sound quality is decent, base is not fantastic and it would be nice to be able to change how strong it is, but you can hear it so as long as you're not attached to a very strong base these will work fine. Control functions on earbuds are nice, and charging is easy. For the price point very solid pair of earbuds. Will update review once I have had them longer to asses their durability and the IPX8 rating.",5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"Great ear buds! I've run about 5 times 4 miles using the ear buds and they've done great. I did have to change the ear plug size. I tried the largest first , then mediums. You have to experiment the best way to fit the buds so they stay put but it didn't take but one run to figure it out. I'm sure this voids my warranty but I forgot they were in my running shorts and washed and dried them. I figured they were ruined or at least the sound guilty would be bad but that wasn't the case. They came on no problem and the next morning used them for my run. The case to store and charge them are also a plus.",5,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"I came across the TOZO T10 earbuds on an Amazon Flash Sale and decided to give them a listen. Long story short--these are keepers.The sound will never compare to wired earbuds in the $100+ range, but they certainly sound good enough for casual listening. Add in the fact that these are wireless comfortable  BLUE TOOTH instruments, and you're looking at a remarkable value. The earbuds, battery-charger case and documentation all look first class and solidly built. The case is charged via USB and holds enough battery power to charge a re-charge the buds a couple of times. Give them a try--for the price, you won't be disappointed.",5,1,2019-2-1,1,0,0
They have various sized ear buds which is nice for my tiny ear holes. Sound quality is great but even better is the sound quality when you are on the phone. I use this for conference calls all the time and my old blue tooth headset was great sound for me but other people couldn't hear me well so I tried these and I haven't had any complaints. Very pleased with the product and the price was great... No need to speed $100 plus for blue tooth ear buds when this bad boys get the job done this good... Super Pleased and highly recommend this product.,5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"These are great and convenient for work.(Don’t tel my boss.) for the price, this is a better alternative to apple/Bose/Samsung ear buds. The batter lasts about 4-5 hours. I can walk fairly far away from my phone without them cutting out. The wireless charging feature is cool. My truck has a charging pad so I leave the capsule on there while I drive. The ONE and only con is that sound quality does not quite compare to the expensive brands. But on that note, this ain’t an expensive product, and they still sound very good. I would compare the sound quality to the standard apple/Samsung headphones that come with our phones. Would by again for a gift.",5,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0

"So my son wanted the new Samsung pods but for what they cost I was afraid he'd lose one.  So I saw these Tozo's and they were reasonably priced and had solid reviews.  After a couple of months they are holding up well. The sound and fit are great. Make sure you use the right cover for your ear! The mic picks up phone conversations pretty easy, though I've only used it indoors to make calls. They were pretty easy to pair to our phones and the charger case is nice, maybe a little bulky but with the extra juice for your phone it's worth the bulge in your pocket. Overall they're a solid pair with great sound and features. Do yourself a favor and get two pair!",5,1,2019-6-14,1,0,0
"First off, these headphones sound amazing. They don't have too much of any one frequency (i.e. too much bass, mid, or treble), and they block out the sound around you really well. Additionally, they stay put in your ears really well during exercise or any physical activity. My only issue is that every once in a while, the right ear (the main earbud that your phone connects to) will occasionally lose connection with the left channel. This causes the audio to cut out in both very briefly (less than a second), then the signal will briefly become mono (again, for less than a second), then will fade back to stereo. Also, be prepared that the two earbuds will occasionally disconnect from one another if you turn your head a certain way. I saw that a lot of people had this issue as well, but I don't feel like it degrades the quality of these earbuds in any way. I can't speak to the waterproof aspect of these earbuds because I have yet to take them into a situation where they would come into contact with water. I'll update this review if I do. If you're looking for a solid pair of totally wireless earbuds that sound great, block out sound, and stay in your ears no matter what you do, get these.",4,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"So, these earbuds are great. There's already thousands of reviews that say that and they are right. Multiple charges from the charging case, great sound quality, and they fit my ears perfectly.I wear one while sleeping, and it inevitably falls out just because I twist and turn more than the average person. Long story short, my dog found it on the floor just a few days ago and decided to eat it (she is doing fine!). I wouldn't have even been that concerned if it hadn't been the right one, which like most wireless earbud pairs, is required to pair to the phone first for the left one to work (at least in my limited attempts to get the Left one to work independently).",5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
These ear buds are great! I had AirPods and they hurt my ears so I ordered these. They fit great and don’t hurt my ears at all! I ordered two pairs so my husband had a pair too. He was able to do the lawn and was able to hear the whole time which he can’t with his AirPods. They have different size ear pieces so you can get the one that fits and the stereo sounds is great!! I am so impressed with them!!,5,1,2019-12-23,1,1,0
"Includingthis product, I have 3 Bluetooth headphones and I love how this is more convenient because it comes with a case to charge the device and I have not noticed heavy disruption.Pros: its light, waterproof, portable charger to extend battery, has noise cancellation, and the case is extremely convenient.",5,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0
This product seems like it's worth a lot more than $50. Having a a year warranty also made me feel good. I did not want to purchase airbuds or the Galaxy version because I just don't think paying $200 for something that will have another model come out next year makes any sense.The sound and bass is amazing,4,1,2019-8-20,1,1,0
"So I've used these earbuds on 4 different devices and experienced different results on each. However one thing stays consistent, disconnections. Devices used, Note 8, PC(with USB bluetooth adapter), NVIDIA Shield, and iPad Pro. Randomly the left earbud will stop receiving sound for a second then come back. All devices. A couple of the devices the sound was coming through more like morse code. No large distance between me and the device so that shouldn't be the issue. Anyway, for the price, like I said, when they work they're good headphones, but quite annoying to constantly stop hearing audio out of the left ear then it come back.Edit: Customer support has contacted me regarding my issues and offered to send me a new pair since these seem to be defective. I'll update again once I test them out.",4,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0
"Just received today. Buds were out of the pods when I opened the package, but all I had to do was put them back in the slots and take them right out and they came on.

So far Very Good.*Update-I’ve has these a few weeks now and they are very easy to sync and the sound is still great, but you can only use them if you’re sitting still and holding them in your ears constantly. I have bryantuofm@gmail.com clean ears, but when I wear these my ears sweat and they fall out. No matter how much I remove the sweat. God forbid I start working out again, can’t use these. I’m sending back.",2,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"Just got these in the mail today, fully charged, paired em up extremely easily, and have been out and about with my dog since. 3 hours now and they haven't fallen out, lost signal, or seem to be bothered by the sweat. The sound is worth more than the cost. If they're not seated entirely, you will lose the lows, but that's user error, not the product. So far so good, will update review if anything changes.Edit: So, these are great.

"Using this for work and it’s got a very clear mic, even better than my actual headset, something my coworker and I both discovered is that when using as hands free audio, at least on computer programs, it only plays the voip call audio on the right main earbud, the left slave earbud pairs perfectly and plays sound from games and videos beautifully but you can’t get stereo for calls, just a heads up to let you know it’s not broken that’s just how they work. Great quality and the wireless charging ability is an added bonus since all new phones can be wirelessly charged and it is more and morevery happy with this purchase.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"First impression is that these are excellent for the money. The case feels sturdy, the buds don't fall out of my ears, and they sound great. The only complaint is that the buttons on the buds are hard-press and not capacitive touch buttons, making it hard to use the buttons without dislodging the buds. This is a minor complaint and I definitely wouldn't let it deter you from the product.Update after 8 months: I honestly could not be happier with the product! My initial complaint of the hard-press buttons has faded after having some time with them and learning how to press the button without causing any discomfort. I've tested the waterproof-ness in rain, sweat, and the shower and they've stood up to every test. They stay in my ears, sound great, and have no connectivity issues. I listen to many genres of music and have never felt like the audio quality lacks in any particular area. They sound great in general; a hardcore audiophile may be able to complain but I sure can't. Being a college student during the COVID-19 pandemic, I have the earbuds in for entire days of online classes. Not only do they never grow uncomfortable, but the battery lasts throughout with only 15 minutes to charge between classes. The case keeps them charged longer than I've ever needed them to be and wireless charging makes the case super easy to keep charged. The case is bulkier than that of more premium Airpods or Pixel Buds but I've never had a problem fitting it into a bag or pocket.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"Overall good quality product for the Price.  Tozo earbuds go as loud as I could want.  They definitely cancel noise well and the battery lasts at least as long as advertised.  Charging seems quick.  Bose soundsport series are better imo for sweaty activities or listening in the shower - but they cost twice the price.- Even on the lowest click of sound on my phone the sound coming from the earbuds is loud enough.  high volume is LOUD - italicized, underlined, bolded, highlighted.  Definitely immersive, probably bad for ears. My perceived volume (of earbud output) is something like between 55 to 110 decibels - when phone volume is scaled minimum to maximum, respectively - imo.",5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
These buds go everywhere with me. They have great sound and incredible battery life. It took me awhile to get used to the different button presses on each ear but I have yet to have anyone complain that they can't hear me when I use the mic with my phone and I can listen to my music anywhere on the go. I especially like that the case can be wirelessly charged or with a cord and that the case charges the buds automatically whenever you place them inside.,5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"Love these! They are clear and very simple to set up. They feel almost weightless and very comfortable. I like the case. Feels durable and love that it holds up to 4 additional charges for both pieces. I wish the battery lasted longer because of the work that I do, but 3-4 hours is still longer than the last pair I used and with the case to charge them, it’s so simple. I think I might use one at a time and alternate through the day to keep a steady flow of music. Anyway, great headphones! Gonna recommend to everyone I know.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
This is a piece of junk. This is so large and heavy that with smallest movement of your head falls out. The sound quality is very average and the battery life is unbelievably short. It takes for ever to charge up and the connecting with and attachment very poor quality. I thought if I get something more expensive would be better while the cheaper brand that my friend got with half of the price of this one is ten times better in every aspect. Don’t buy this piece of junk.,1,1,2019-11-26,1,2,0
Wow. For $45 I’m in love.I am a real buyer and a real skeptic. I don’t trust these reviews sometimes.,5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"Great value for the price. They sound good. Fit in ears and stay in very easily even when moving and sweaty. Bad part is the connection isn’t that great, if anything gets near your right side (right ear bud connects to phone then left ear bud gets signal from right ear bud) it’ll distort the sound. Battery life isn’t great but with how small they are that’s not unexpected. The charger is also the case and is portable which is a huge bonus.",4,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"I bought these to wear while swimming. They work in pool but only if you're above the water.  As soon as your head is covered even slightly you lose connection.  And they don't fit well in ear even with the smallest fitting. When swimming my arm hits the earbud and it pops out. But I think the most frustrating thing is I have to re-pair it every time I use it. It doesn't automatically connect like all my other ones. The last thing is the battery doesn't last. I have to charge them every time before I use them. So, they're fine if you are lounging in the water, just don't go below it.",3,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0
"They don’t stay in my ears very well, they fall out easily. That makes me fear I might lose one. I’ve had them for 3weeks. They were great at first, but lately the sound is jumping from lt to rt ear, which is frustrating when trying to listen to something with them! Lasted less then a year and quit charging so now I have to new pair!!!! I will buy a different brand!!!",1,1,2019-3-14,1,2,0
"This was my first set of earbuds that were completely wireless (all my previous had a strap that connected the two buds). I was very skeptical that they would stay in during my workouts. I was amazed at how they fit so comfortably and stayed in place even with heavy sweating. I'm not an audiophile, but I found the sound quality great - way better than what I had previously been using. I also found the noise cancellation to be quite effective.I very much enjoy these earbuds and would recommend based on quality and value for the $.",5,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
Reviews were fantastic on these and the T12's.  I opted for the T10's since they were on sale. The sound is amazing!!!! Easy to set up works with all my devices. I was even able to use one earpiece separate from the other!WOW!,5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
"Really enjoyed these at first, however over time I’ve had issues with charging. It will charge fine I can use them for my walk or whatever workout routine I have but then the next time I go to use them they’re dead. My workout is an hour long. I come home, turn them off and put them back in the case. So I should be able to use them again, but I can’t.Other than that they’ve been wonderful. I even occasionally use them to nap",4,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"awesome first set of wireless earbuds and im very happy with them! the sound is clear with surprisingly good bass. the only issue i have with them is there is no volume control on the buds themselves, only off/on/recall (which why would ANYONE want a feature to redial the last number that called them? seems stupid",4,1,2019-12-20,1,2,0
The sound quality would be okay IF the left bid did not continually lose signal and quit emitting sound. I am contemplating returning these as I’m disappointed with the connection strength.Update: TOZO did offer me a new pair of ear buds after my negative review. They told me not to return the old ones which was nice. Then they asked me to update my review even before the replacements arrived due to their goodwill gesture. I told them via email that my review was not for service but rather product quality. Unfortunately the new ear buds have the same issue. I fear that the Amazon reviews have been skewed to show good quality when many people have issues but receive additional product in return for them to improve their review.,2,1,2019-5-18,1,0,0
"I ordered these same earbuds for myself, so naturally,  my 12 yr old wanted a pair for himself. Got these blue ones & he was mostly excited to wear them & try them out while swimming. Unfortunately, the left one fell out of his ear & is no longer working. I would not say they are 'waterproof' as the pamphlet & description states. Strongly recommend you not get them anywhere near water. A little falsely advertised, but overall a good earbud.",4,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"I am so glad I finally stopped buying the cheap $5 earbuds like every week and purchased these. They have 4 different ear bud sizes to fit pretty much everyone, although I think it would still be too big for children on the smallest setting. The small fit me perfectly, they never fall out when I'm working out. Syncing them to my phone was amazing, it just happened right before I could read the instructions on how, all I did was turn them on and my phone found it right away. I do wish the sound had a little more bass, but other than that sound quality is great. I haven't tried using for anything like phone calls yet.",5,1,2019-3-20,1,0,0
"I bought these for running to replace my corded earbuds and was astounded how much better these sound compared to my sony earbuds.  I've had them around a week now and am amazed at the quality for this price.  They also look pretty subtle, which I appreciate.  I did buy Comply Memory foam tips to help them stay in my ear because the silicone ones that usually come with any earbuds don't stay in while running.  The combination makes for great sound quality, which goes well beyond the $55 I paid for both products combined.I don't really use them for noise cancellation and can't speak to that... but seems like it blocks out faint sounds.  I have them in right now and can't hear the typing on my laptop.  I run with the music really loud and attribute that to not being able to hear outside rather than these having noise cancellation quality. Overall these are amazing and meet the expectations I bought them for.",5,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
"These earbuds have already really impressed me, I had been trying to find a good pair of truly wireless earbuds and looked at JBL, Bose, and scull candy and all of the reviews were very sub par and if I was going to pay anywhere from $100-200 for earbuds I wanted them to be quality. I found these on Amazon because they were very highly rated and had over 8000 reviewers, me at others had 100 reviewers at best. I assumed with that many positive reviews they must be doing something right so I picked these up for $50 and it was a great decision.The packaging was very high quality, well protected and packed, free 1 year extended warranty right at the front of the box. These were super intuitive and worked right out of the box, both the earbuds and the case had charges, the buds paired without problem with each other and almost as easily with my phone. I love that when I pull these out of the case they turn on and shut off when I put them back, they automatically pair with each other when I pull them both out. Another feature that makes these an absolute winner is that they can be paired separately. I wear these a lot when working and in an industrial environment you always have to be able to hear what is going on around you. It takes a minute for the individual bud to stop searching for it's pair but when it's done it works flawlessly, I can also pair the left separate so I can use one untill the battery runs out and then swap. I used just one for close to 8 hours only throwing it back in the case for 15 minutes at a time while I was on break. I was able to walk upto 50 feet away with no dropping or sound degradation, I did have some drops with it in my back pocket but for the most part there has been no issue.",5,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0
"I have been pleasantly surprised by how great the sound is and how great the range is on these headphones! I have owned wireless headphones before, but have never invested in solo earbuds that can work together or alone. These are pretty large, I won’t lie, but the sound is great. Better yet, if I leave my phone in one room and walk into another, I don’t lose my music. This is huge plus for me. You can’t control the volume with them, which is a small downside, but my phone is typically within arms reach anyway. They hold charge for several hours and the great thing is that the storage case is a charger. When I’m done listening, I just toss them in my bag and they charge up in between sessions. They’re a great set of earbuds.",4,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"The Tozo T10 is my first and only earbuds so don't have comparison point. That said, I absolutely love the T10 buds. Awesome sound and volume. They're noise canceling and waterproof, but haven't tested the waterproof function. One charge provides an hour of music play and charges 4 times in the battery pack. Super easy to use and everything true that says in the guide book. Loved how it paired with the phone and together R+L so effortlessly. Overall, happy, satisfied with my Tozo T10 earbuds.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

"I am mostly very happy with these earbuds and I do recommend them - they have great sound and are very comfortable to wear for long periods.  I did have an issue with the first pair that I bought: despite light use, the left earbud stopped pairing after 5 months and couldn't be reset.  But the customer support was excellent:  they responded quickly with technical advice, and when the unit couldn't be reset, they sent me a brand new set of earbuds right away.  So I'm taking one star off my review for reliability, but otherwise can't complain.  The only other thing that would be nice is if the battery life were a little longer - once charged, I've had no problems with the battery dying while the earbuds were in use for a few hours, but if you leave the earbuds unused in the charging case (unplugged), the earbuds and case will die over a period of several days, so that if you come back after a week or a little longer, you will need to recharge the entire unit before you can use the earbuds.  Not a huge issue, but since I only use my earbuds occasionally, it's an annoyance.",4,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
The fact that these are waterproof are ideal for any type of situation.  The sound quality is one the best out there.  The fact that you can connect to either side of the ear bud is helpful when you just want one in.  I usually use one at a time and when the battery dies on one side I switch out to the other one while charging.  There are however some limits to the headphones.  The first being that they will lose connection to your phone or blue tooth device pretty easily.  Does not  matter where you place the device.  The charging time for the headphones is a little on the slow side but understandable with the recharging box.  Overall I would recommend this brand of wireless headphones.,4,1,2019-6-20,1,1,0
"These are really great bluetooth earbuds. The sound is amazing and the wireless charger is a plus.  It comes with a plug for wired charging but its just so easy to set it down on the wireless charging.  I go speed walking with these and they haven't fallen out.  The only thing iv'e noticed is the lack of volume control on the earbuds.  If you use them with your phone or tablet, you raise and lower the volume with the phone's volume controls.  Overll great earbuds and way cheaper than apple  or samsung etc...",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0

Also, the last blutooth headphones I bought had a delay between spoken word on the screen and what I heard.  These do not, for whatever that is worth.  They seem to keep there charge for a long time.  I haven't even really noticed the battery life dropping.  I first tried the ear pieces that came on the buds and they fit and stay in.  I have not exercised with them yet, but I've done chores around the house and they stay in.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"I really wanted to rate these 3/5 but given the poor experience I had with my last pair of bluetooth earbuds these were much better. The battery life is only a few hours but they charge quickly enough in the case. It feels just barely premium enough, the buds magnetically click into place satisfyingly. The pairing and sync experience isn't perfect, sometimes they'll need to be put back into their case and pulled out to ""reset"" them. One can be used by itself but will beep annoyingly looking for it's partner for a short amount of time (less than 2 minutes or so I guesstimate) after starting to use it.Also, maybe I've got weird ears but I can never seem to get a good seal with earbuds and these are no exception.",4,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
"So the earbuds play music and you can connect them both after finding the left and right bluetooth channels from your phone. BUT they are much bigger than I expected and they won't even stay in my ear. I tried all three size buds they gave me and non of the sizes would comfortably stay in my ear. Also i tried to just listen to one bud and the earbud constantly paused and played, so you cant only have on in at one time. When you charge your earbuds through the case, the earbud's LED light always stays at an orange, so you never know when they're charged.Obviously returning them.",2,1,2019-3-25,1,1,0

As she doesn't see them, she doesn't realize Mommy can't hear all about the Little Pony episode.  :)  The bass is great, which is always a favorite of mine.

"Overall these are fairly good. However, the lack of a touch button (physical button instead) was a bummer. Also, I don't think you can cycle through songs??? Wasn't able to go to the next or previous song at all and didn't see the option in the manual. I'd say these are great for someone who loves their entire playlist/music library and doesn't skip many songs or those who answer calls a lot, as the phone features were there.",3,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"I’m a total music snob but on a budget. I like my bass to be deep and the sound to be rich. These are awesome buds. The pre-installed ear pieces were a touch too large but it comes with four or five different sizes ranging from tiny to huge. Once I attached the next size down, it actually enhanced the noise cancellation and the music quality since everything was sealed properly. I have not tested out the water proof ness yet so no comment there. I do like that the case is wireless charging capable as the cord it comes with is like four inches long. So far these are quality earbuds on a budget.",5,1,2019-4-26,1,0,0

"If you don't feel like paying upwards of 100 dollars for wireless earbuds then this is one of the best budget options available. The earbuds themselves came with a charge out of the box. Setup was straightforward and simple. Took me a little bit to get used to the sensation of them because they're meant to go deeper into your ear than I expected, but when I situated them in my ears correctly, I was very impressed with just how well they cancelled sound. As far as sound is concerned, they are enjoyable to listen to music with. As advertised the bass is indeed noticeable. You might not use them in a studio setting for mixing, but it's unfair to compare these earbuds to Beyerdynamic headphones.It's very important to consider the context when giving this product a final score. If this was released in the $150 to $200 range, then it would be a low 3-star to high 2-star rating. However, for what these earbuds are and the price, the quality of sound is remarkable. Remarkable enough that I feel it deserves a 5-star rating and personal recommendation.",5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0

"Started working at Walmart and their radio is one trash playlist that goes on repeat non-stop that will drive you absolutely insane after a couple days! I bought these so I could save my mental health with my own music but I can only use 1 earbud at a time since I need at least one ear to hear other people. My plan was to use one side while the other one is charging in my pocket and switch them once the battery of the first ran out. It would be perfect if it wasn't some stupid ""master"" and ""slave"" system they have with the earbuds... Basically the left side (slave) doesn't work unless the right side (master) is also on... So I can only use the right side until it runs out of batteries and I cannot use the left side at all even if it's fully charged because the right side isn't on. (when you put them in the charging case they automatically disconnect). The sound quality and comfort are pretty good but I'm giving a 2 start because of this ridiculous idea of only being able to use the left side with the right side on... I feel like I wasted money... Unless I'm being an idiot and there's actually a way to switch them (which in that case I'd appreciate some help).",2,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0

I have now worn them while working, running, biking, lifting and gardening and they have stayed tight in my ears the entire time.The sound quality is very good.

"I bought these to use at work. They worked great to begin with, but after a week,  they unpaired themselves from each other. It used to be you pulled both earbuds out of the charger, put them in your ear and they first would pair with each other and then pair with the bluetooth device. I have reset both earbuds and then repaired the tight channel and the left will still not pair with the right earbud. I can find the left and right earbuds on my available devices to pair with, but I can either hear the left channel or right channel, but not both at the same time.I emailed the company at the address they listed in their manual and the email bounced back to me as an invalid email address and there is no forwarding address, so don't buy these as there is no way to contact the company",1,1,2019-11-29,1,1,0

Just don't use it to talk in the office. Hence 1/2 the stars for 1/2 the use.",3,1,2019-3-24,1,2,0

"Love these new earbuds with several brands and styles which I have purchased, these are the best all around.  They fill my ear well, have good sound, and adore the water resistant nature of these earbuds.  I have, as noted, many pairs from other mfgs on Amazon.  I work out daily, run, lift, and swim.  As part of that workout, I hit the Steam room, and jacuzzi and easily dunk my head in the pool or jacuzzi without any troubles.  Of course Bluetooth cannot transmit in water, however, as soon as your ears are clear of the water, sound picks right back up.  An important note is that if you drop it in the water to a depth of 3 feet or so...you are likely to have troubles.  The right earbud is the most likely to have troubles it seems after water at depth.  The first pair I dried in salt/rice for a day or so and it was still dead.  Then the second pair, after drying out, has recovered and is working fine.  Get them wet...no Problem, drop them in 3 feet of water for 20 seconds...likely dead.",4,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0

"They were great, at first, but like all cheapo wireless ear buds, they get worse over time. For me, the 3 month mark was when i noticed that the connection would cut out quite frequently.

Look elsewhere, i hear Rayban make these too",2,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0

I wear them at work, at night in bed, out in the garden, in the tub, etc.  They pair effortlessly and the case holds a charge as well so you can bring them and recharge as needed. my only complaint is that i always misplace them!

As soon as I switched to my Samsung, I've never been able to successfully go back to the Macbook connection. They are a hit-or-miss with the connection now. Sometimes they connect and it's fine, other times it's a disaster and I end up just plugging in my wired headphones.I tried restarting my computer, forgetting and re-adding the headphones to the bluetooth signal etc. They just don't seem to be consistent.",3,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0

I didn't plan on using it that often.  It actually works excellent and nobody has complained about not being able to hear me.  They have connected well to all my devices and work regardless of whether I'm using one or two.  Great purchase and would recommend to others!Impressive battery too!,5,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
"Pros: Great sound quality. Fits in my ear perfectly. Case charges fastCons: You can't listen to the left without the right. But you can listen to the right without the left. Very sensitive, I dropped my right one on the floor and now it doesn't work. Which is bad because now I can't listen to my left one because my right one doesn't work.",4,1,2019-9-4,1,0,0
"I really like the quality of the sound from these earphones. The fit is very comfortable, the case is so handy and being able to charge on my Q-charger in the case is perfect. The case carries another charge as well just by placing my earphones back inside. They pair automatically every time I take them out to use them.I had purchased a few different brands/styles to compare to determine what earphones would be the best, these came in top.",4,1,2019-4-1,1,0,0
"This is an edited review after quite a bit of use. The Bluetooth connection is awful despite everything I have tried. I have a set of Bose QuietComfort 35 that I use around the house with immaculate connection even if I'm in a different room from my phone. These, however, skip and drop the connection even if I'm holding my phone (connection point). Also, I was promised a cheap [free] wireless charger by the manufacturer if I left a positive review. The discount code is garbage and the initial positive review they bought from me was no more than a purchased review.Low-quality Bluetooth headphones and a fake offer for a free charger.  Even if the company likely offers a working code after seeing this review, my review of the actual headphones stands. Look elsewhere.",2,1,2019-3-6,1,1,0
"I have had these for a few months now, and for the most part they are very good.  The issue I have is when I run with them.  I put my phone in a fanny pack that goes around my waist.  As soon as I zip it shut, the sound cuts in and out constantly.  This is very annoying.  As soon as I take it out, everything is fine.  The only way I can run with these is to have my phone in my hand, which just does not work.  I have had to go back to wired earphones when I run.",3,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
I literally just received these an hour or two ago so here are my first thoughts:1.) I love the color! It’s like a dusty rose or rose-gold color.,5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,1
"These have great sound, and connect/disconnect flawlessly. I’ve owned many pairs of Bluetooth earbuds before, and this has been by-far the best. Water-proof, compact, sound great, work perfect, they meet or exceed all my expectations.My only very minor complaint is I’d like the battery to last a little longer, but honestly I’m probably getting 4 hours of listening (not standby, but producing sound) out of a charge, so I don’t really have room to complain about that.",5,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"Admittedly, I'm a tradionalist. I've always believed wired ear pieces carry the best sound as does vinyl. My workouts with my iPod Nano were getting cumbersome with the wire. The wire got hung during a lot of exercises. I made the jump and was worried about the sound quality, but read all the other reviews. To my shock and awe, these earbuds are freaking amazing!! They paired up easily to my iPod Nano. The sound was better than 1ired ear pieces. The comfort in the ear is amazing too! Highly recommend!",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"UPDATE: I give props to TOZO - with this review they reached out and offered to send me another set of earbuds.The sound is great and it's super convenient.  I just wish they'd stay in my ears.  I have taken a walk in them and find myself securing them (and accidentally turning off the music), but it could be just me.  Who knows?  Like I said, TOZO has gone out of their way to make things right and for that, I applaud their customer service department.",2,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"What I liked. Well the sound quality is something that I would expect from something more expensive. The ease of pairing was instantaneous. I paired this with an iPhone XR. What else I liked was that I could use them right away, they were already precharged and the accessories that were included made the deal even better. Differs size ear bud adapter for different size ears, charging cable, a carrying strap.What I disliked. I should have bought these along time ago.",5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"I’ve only had mine a few weeks, and just a few minutes ago I dropped the right one, and they both disconnected ( the right one said “disconnected” in a super low voice, and twice instead of once ) and then both shut off, and now the left one registered as the dominant one and I can’t fix it. The right one won’t play music at all, and it won’t let me reset them. I paid with my hard earned money, and dropping it once after only having them for a few weeks destroys them? This absolutely sucks, I don’t know what to do.",1,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"Got these instead of Samsung, mistake.  As others have said, while mowing and phone in pocket, they constantly cut out. When they were working they were great, I could hear everything while mowing. They work great with the phone on a table walking around the house.  I also have to manually connect them every time I pull them out. Using a note 9.",1,1,2019-4-19,1,2,0
"I really love the sound in my new headphones. I really love that I can have the volume on very low and it still sounds loud. Most earbuds you want to turn up the volume when it Is on already as high as it will go. These do not disappoint. They charge nicely on my wireless charger. I just wish when I ordered them, the only color option was in black. Now when I am writing my review, they come in navy, white, khaki and grey. To me that’s the only fault I can find. If I’m receiving a call, it’s best to touch the ear bud with one hand and tap it with the other hand to prevent the ear bud from digging into your ear. I love that it comes with all 4 sizes, as my experience is I have a very small ear. I have yet to use it in the shower, but I have listened to my Kindle audio, Spotify when I walk daily, and around the house while I am cooking or cleaning. A wonderful birthday present that I am using 4 to 6 hours daily during the pandemic. Thanks bunches sister 😊 I’m so glad that I chose these with my gift card versus paying a premium for Samsung.",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"I've been searching for a decent pair of wireless earbuds for mountain biking with a responsible price. The Tozo's T10 was it.  Not only was the price phenomenal, but the quality of the packing could also easily fool someone that these earbuds were out to compete with its costly counterparts, such as Sony, Beats, etc. They fit great and are comfortable, staying in the ear during vigorous movement. But I must say, as an owner of many Bluetooth headphones, the time it took to pair with my phone was near-instantaneous—before I could blink.My only quibble with these earbuds is the sound quality. They can get loud; however, the clarity left me desiring more. But, for the price, this is not a valid complaint. I got more than my money's worth. In short, don't expect Sony sound quality; it's not what this company is doing.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"Very disappointed with this purchase. Batteries from full charge only lasted 2.5 hrs. of music. Range is barely 10 feet from the phone. I have a pair of bluetooth headphones that range out more than 40 feet from the phone through multiple walls. These cut out a few feet away in the same room. Sound is average at best; very little bass response at all compared to a $10 pair of cheap wired earbuds.Units are oddly angled into the ear, and are uncomfortable with any of the 4 sizes of earpieces available. Overall, this is not something I would ever purchase again. For the price of these, I expected a lot more.",2,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
I was very pleased that these fit my ears well and I'm able to ride my horses at all gaits and they stay perfectly in place. The sound quality did not disappoint either. My husband has a pair of Jabra Elite and scoffed when I told them how good the quality was. I made him wear them to prove it! I think he's a bit miffed that mine were so inexpensive and yet comparable in quality.The charging case is pretty cool - very well built and charges the earbuds multiple times before needing to be recharged itself.,5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"I needed a new pair of earbuds for work i spend few weeks looking at reviews wHatching videos etc... until i came across with this ones,At first I was a little skeptical because I've never heard of the brand and they were quite cheap tbh, but I gave these a chance and I was pleasantly surprised with the sound and build quality when i fist got them I've owned many of the high dollar brands before and these sound, look and feel way more expensive than they are. For the price you can't go wrong. They are waterproof i when i say they are waterproof they are lol i work outside inand i used them all the time dont matter if it raining they would work just as great!! come with their own wireless charging case, the cancel out noise very well and they sound AWESOME! I was a little worried they wouldn't be loud enough, but they are plenty loud. They are as loud as your phone or other device will allow. For these features and quality you should expect to spend many more times the asking price, but TOZO is doing us all a favor and are offering these at a great deal.I did have an issue with my set though when they first came in... At first they worked awesome but out of nowhere the right earbud just stopped working and nothing I tried would resolve the issue. Fortunately these come with a warranty (which is another thing you won't find at this low price point) so I contacted customer service and they helped resolve my issue straight away. Customer service was helpful, polite and FAST to act on my issues and everything has been sorted out to my satisfaction.",5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,1
"These offer multiple options to fit various ear sizes but none of them fit mine. They’re bulky and heavy and fall out easily (e.g. if I turn my head, talk, or move). Also, I’m not sure if this is indicative of all Bluetooth ear buds, but the times I had them in, I felt small electric shocks in my ears. Very strange and disconcerting. Sad that I wasted my money on these.",1,1,2020-4-20,1,1,0
I really wanted to like these ear buds. Seem to be well built. Playing music is decent (but I'm a 60-something so my ears are not terribly sensitive any more).The mic killed them for me.,1,1,2019-8-26,1,1,1
"These are by far the best wireless earbuds I have ever bought. The noise cancellation is one of its greatest perks and it really immerses you into whatever you are listening to. Unlike other wireless earbuds of the same price, it really makes whatever you are listening to sound like its in the room and not just in your ears. I have been using mine for several months now and I've only had 1 pairing issue and it was resolved within minutes. They are lightweight and very comfortable and have different bud sizes to fit your ears perfectly so if your ears are too big or too small for the ones they come with you can easily adjust. They charge fast and they last a long time. they are durable and can even survive in the water so you can use them in the rain or even in the shower. The costumer service is amazing and will bend over backwards to help you out with any issue. Over all I dont think that a 5 star review cant really do it justice for the quality it has, I genuinely have no bad things to say about these earbuds they are beyond perfect and are my favorite earbuds by far.",5,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"I bought these because I needed a good set of ear buds, but did not wish to go with the Samsung or Bose, as I read lots of reviews that these items were not great for the price.  I LOVE these ear buds!  First, they're super comfy and fit my ears perfectly.  Second, they have great audio quality!  I didn't expect the bass level to be where it was for this price.  I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of these ear buds.",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"Wasn't expecting much when I ordered them, but have been pleasantly surprised.  They hold a charge for a long time and have good audio.  None of these are great for staying in place in my ears when at the gym.  At least once a week one falls out while jogging or doing some form of cardio.  I have tried a few models and the designs are the same and maybe  it's an ear things.  No complaints and they work better than a pair I tried and returned from Best Buy that was almost double the price.",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"I was really excited and hopeful for these earbuds, as they were my first wireless earbuds. However, I received them a few hours ago, charged them, and took them with me to the gym. At the gym now and wasn’t even able to work out with them for ONE MINUTE without the left earbud cutting out CONSTANTLY. Thankfully, I had my other pair of headphones with me and I’m using those as I’m sitting, writing this review.These are junk. There’s obviously a glitch, since many others have had this same EXACT problem. The manufacturer should really fix it. Til then, these are going back. Don’t waste your time buying these!!",1,1,2019-7-9,1,0,0
"These earbuds paired nicely, my only concern was one of the packages (I ordered two sets) had been previously opened and the earbuds had white stuff on them as though they have been placed in someone's ears. I disinfected them thoroughly with wipes, including the charging case, so it wasn't really a deal breaker for me, but that's why I gave them three stars. I thought I was purchasing two sets of brand new bluetooth earbuds. I chose to give the brand new case with cellophane around it to my husband.",3,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"TOZO-T10 Satisfied One-Eared Customer, overall rating 4.9.The primary reason I bought these earbuds was as a cheap alternative to using an expensive hearing aid for music listening during wet, cold, windy, and risky outdoor activities where I live in Southeast Alaska.  Having used them now for several weeks of fall hiking, boating, bushwhacking, road-side litter pickup, and working in/around home (as well as for frequent post-activity hot tub soaks), I am completely satisfied with their overall performance.",5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
I have another set of these and have loved them.Unfortunately 1 popped out of my ear and fell into our bedroom wood floor and has never worked since. It will charge and tries to speak but it is in slow motion and not usable.,3,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"I gave a pair each to my daughter and son-in-law for Christmas. Both units have performed as advertised. Pairing was easy and sound quality is above what I expected for the price. Noise cancelling is very effective, they can't hear me when I'm talking at a normal voice. They have 2 small children, so I have some reservations about that, but it gives each of them some time to themselves with music or a show. No noticeable lag when watching videos. Haven't tried the waterproofing yet, but I wanted these for them when they go to the gym. That the case is waterproof is a big upgrade IMO as you don't get that with even the high end buds. Will update after 1-2 months of use or if any problems are encountered.",4,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"I bought this product about 2 weeks ago and I was using it pretty much all the time, at work, at home and even for working out. My first impression was WOW this is cool, everything was fine until suddenly the left earbud start going on and off, either on a call or playing some media, also noted that got worst if I started moving my head, don't know why but that was what I noted. Also the other day I was working on my yard, and I was in a squat position with my phone in my left pocket, and the media started cutting off, then when I stood up was fine, I did it repeatedly to reproduce the issue, and yes, it was an issue, every time, same behaviour.When is working sound quality is great, noise reduction is great, I used at work to avoid distractions and look and feel is great also, I didn't try any of the really expensive ones, but this ones, except for the issues explained above, are good. I just hope is a problem with the pair I got and not with the product itself.",3,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0

"Love these and would definitely recommend! Tozo has excellent customer service and are very helpful and prompt with any issues.  I’ve had them for about 9 months and regularly wear them in the shower, tub, and swimming pool. The sound quality is better than some other Bluetooth earbuds I’ve tried , however the microphone for phone calls is not a good as I wish it was - some people hear me just fine, some people can’t hear me and I need to change to handheld mode for the call. I find them comfortable (so many earpiece choices, you’ll find one that fits you) and good battery life. After 9 months I finally had a problem with the left earbud, but Tozo has been really helpful and gone above and beyond to help me out.",5,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0
"Edit 9/27/2019: I used the earbuds for a little more than a week and one got this distorted sound and half the time wouldn't turn on. I got a replacement through amazon and used it for a little more than two weeks when the right earbud stopped charging in the charging case all together unless you held it down at the right angle. I contacted TOZO and they sent a replacement in just 2 days, however sadly on arrival the right earbud once again wouldn't charge and I was stuck with two sets of broken earbuds. I wanted to love these earbuds and i'm sure if I contacted the company they would give me another replacement as their customer service seems great. I decided however, to go with a different brand around the same price and have had no problems.The TOZO T10 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds are the best I've tried out of many other products at this price range. The IPX8 waterproofing, sound quality, connection, and charging case features all make these earbuds the best for me.",5,1,2019-8-1,1,0,1
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my husband. Worked fine until the right earbud stopped turning on and won't charge. Nothing he does makes it turn on. Worked for three months.Edit: company was very responsive and gave me an Amazon gift card in place of a new set of earbuds.,4,1,2020-4-21,1,1,0
"I've been using these headphones for about 2 weeks now and think they are great. The main reason I chose these was for the IPX8 waterproofing, and the case that holds them has a lid. Sound quality is very good for an in-ear model. My only complaints are the earbuds are a bit bulky in your ears (but I have small ears) and the range of the Bluetooth could be improved a bit as well. If your phone is in your pocket you won't notice any issues with Bluetooth range, but if you leave the phone out you will notice the range cuts out after about 10-15 feet.",5,1,2019-9-5,1,0,0
"These are pretty amazing little earbuds. They stay in when exercising, and they sound great. The charging box they come with is very convenient, and as long as you plug it in from time to time, you can charge the headphones anywhere no wires needed. The whole thing seems very well made and every consideration was taken to design them for convenience/comfort. One note they do not fit in my wife’s ears, it comes with smaller ear buds, but the device itself is bigger than her hears so it maybe isn’t the best for more petite wearers.",5,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
I'm always skeptical about wireless headphones but these things are life changing. No more untangling wires before listening to your music on the go. I like how compact they are and they do the same thing as airpods while you pay 4 times less. The headphones did pop out of my ears as I was walking but I found out that I just needed to change out the earbuds for a smaller one. So make sure you try on all the earbud sizes like they suggested and attach the one that is comfortable for you.,5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
"I love these when they’re working well, but once I have them in for a little while they’re falling out constantly. It’s annoying when I’m on a call and the earbud falls out (hang on hang on hang on, I dropped you). The sound quality is good, I just wish they stayed in better and had a little bit longer battery life.Update: I popped smaller earpieces on that came with these and they no longer fall out. I guess I have baby ears!!",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"Pretty good. Definitely better than AirPods. I think this is a problem with bluetooth headsets in general - they sometimes have a hard time staying in.But overall, for $50 they have pretty great sound quality. They’re also waterproof so I shower in these. The only time I’ve had to worry about battery is when I forget to put them back in the charging case throughout the day. If you’re not forgetful like me you’ll be fine. And even if you are I just throw them in the charging case and then wait 30 min before they’re fully charged again.",4,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0

"I’m writing this only on the basis of having just received the earbuds, I will come back to do an update After I’ve used it for sometime. My initial impressions are that the packaging is very good, instructions are clear and the quality seems very good. The charger came with a bit of charge to it but I think it needs to be charged more to get the headphones fully charged. I also noticed that it appears you need the primary (right earbud) to be in use so I’m guessing that it’s not possible to only use the left bud, I’ll check this out and update the review.",4,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"Just got these today and really enjoy them. Ive never had a pair of wireless earbuds before but I was using a pair of Bose wired eadbuds for many years until they broke. So far, the tozo T10s have been really good for the price point.The sound quality is very good and the noise cancelling is unbelievable. Ive never been one to truly feel comfortable with in-ear headphones but these have been fairly convencing. Now while it doesnt feel like a pair of satin pillows, its still soft and becomes unnoticable after a short time. The included selection of domes was a great reason for this.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
I have been wanting a pair of wireless earbuds that I could buy for a decent price and good quality. I wanted it to be at least below $100 dollars.

"Update+++ My left Earbud is now very staticy, and very annoying to listen to while there is no sound to listen to, when the volume is all the up with music you can barely hear it, but it is annoying and a little disappointed they didn’t hold up longer.People saying that their a $100+ pair of earbuds are delusional. They are however quite loud and pretty good sound quality that you could get from a pair of 5 and below headphones. Their is some inconsistent things about the product like sometimes the left earbud while cut off if I move a certain way or in a certain position laying down. Or my device not connecting to both, its usually a 30 second fix  so it’s not a big deal and they are pretty good for the price. Sometimes they do slide out if your oily especially like me and my ear gets oily, wouldn’t recommend for bike rides. The battery life isn’t amazing but it’s okay.",5,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
"I am always happy to review a product that exceeds expectations. I purchased these on a hunch because I was impressed with the reviews. I’ve always wanted some really good wireless Bluetooth earplugs that fit solidly in my ear and deliver good sound.

They are more in-ear than they are “pods.”",5,1,2019-6-3,1,0,0
I received my initial pair of Tozo waterproof earbuds on May 2nd and they worked wonderfully. Then one day I was using them as normal and the right earbud stopped functioning. I reached out to customer service to let them know what happened. They walk me through some troubleshooting steps to which nothing worked. I was then told that I would be receiving a replacement for the malfunctioning ear buds at no cost to me and to not worry about sending the others back. I was and am so grateful for Tozo's high priority on customer service and quality of product. I absolutely love the sound quality and had incorporated these ear buds into my daily routines. So glad I came across these!,4,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"What a deal! These earbuds sounds great and have great battery life. Regrettably, I returned them thinking their range was sub-par, but lately I've come to realize that all earbuds have similar range. I could not hear these in the kitchen (Bluetooth transmitter in living room) and I thought I could get more expensive earbuds that would solve that problem. Turns out the J-Lab ones I bought also could not reach in the same area.",5,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
"I'm quite surprised by the quality of the sound. It's impressive with enough bass to suit my preference. It drowns out ambient noise well enough. I love how deep music sounds and I get to listen to them comfortably. The earbuds are quite comfortable and does not hurt my ears after a few hours of wearing them. So far, I have not had any problems with the mic quality. I use them for my Zoom meetings and everyone can hear me clearly.

"I had purchased some Blackweb wireless headphones from Walmart and within one week, the left ear would not consistently charge in the charger case. When it did charge it was only good for about 2 hours and then die.  I purchase these TOZO to replace the others and not only do they have superior sound quality, but they also fit in the ear much better than the previous brand. You can even pair them with multiple devices without having to go and unpair one before you can link up with another.  This was a wise purchase and I will try other TOZO products.",5,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"I gave this product only a three because no matter the size of the earbuds I choose (there were three unique sets that came with  the product and I tried the smaller two sets.  The smallest size fits in my ear, but falls out even just turning my head. The middle size is a tight fit, but I can get them in place. The problem is that after a bit one or the other- will pop out unexpectIely. Happily, I haven't lost one yet because I've either felt it pop out, or heard it fall o:- the floor. .Still,  I don't find it acceptable toalway have to be vigilant!",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"Ok pair of earbuds for the money as far as sound goes. However, if you intend to do anything remotely active or have any kind of motion to you these will fall out repeatedly. Constantly adjusting them or grabing them before the fall at the gym. Vacuuming? Out. Cleaning? Out. Thinking about the mechanisims involved in the protonationof a OH group? Out. If you don't intend on moving much or don't mind constantly adjusting them then these are a good buy.",2,1,2019-11-7,1,1,0
I love the idea of these earbuds and really wanted them to work. I tried all of the rubber pieces. None allowed the earbuds to stay firmly in place no matter how I twisted to insert them.

"UPDATE: AMAZON WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE VALID TOZO CONTACT INFO THUS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FILE FOR WARRANTY FOR UNUSABLE PRODUCT. Used these once and, since they kept falling out of my small ears, put them aside for 3 months. Once I decided to try again, attempted to charge but, alas, they will not charge although it appears from the illumination on the case they are charging. So frustrating since they are no longer returnable. What a waste!",1,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"I'm probably one of the last people to switch over to wireless earbuds. I have a galaxy and was going to get the galaxy buds, but didn't want to spend the money and possibly dislike them. Went on amazon and saw these as top rated, especially for bass sound. The sound quality was the #1 reason why I didn't want to go wireless.( I had previously heard sound from others wireless and nothing compared to wired)The sound quality is amazing and the bass is deep and nice! Easy to pair to my phone. Comes with multiple ear adjustments and is comfortable and stays in place at the gym. I haven't used the call feature on it yet, so I don't know how that works. I will say, I do get interference from others earbuds when the gym is busy but it's hit or miss. I think it's specifically the airpods that do it. Overall, for 50 dollars they are worth the purchase. Glad I went with these instead of the galaxy buds- great quality and a fraction of the price.",5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"Easy, intuitive, effective, good price!  These really work: They fit right out of the box, stay in the ear, pair readily  with all of my devices and have good sound.  Plus the range is good:  I often forget to take them out when walking out the door, and they can maintain the connection for short distances outside, and re-connect themselves when I come back into range.  Best of all, they work independently, so listening with one ear at a time, no wait for recharges.  The storage/charging case gives them a home that helps me to not lose them.",5,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"Usually ""cheap"" and ""quality product"" aren't two words that go together.

I decided to upgrade, and decided on this pair after seeing the reviews and the price. They even through on a 20% coupon for my order!",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"The buds take getting used to putting into your ears for a good fit.  Once you figure out how to rotate them and insert, they are great.  Good Sound! My son wants to steal them from me.  I may have to buy another pair for him.  I like that they are waterproof but I admit that I am very hesitant to try to swim with them.  Has anyone else actually swam with them in??  My son swims so if I get him a pair I'd like to ensure they can withstand water during swim practice.  overall, Company seems to want to ensure I'm happy and so far everything has been great!",5,1,2019-5-24,1,1,0
"Am impressed with the TOZO T10. The product quality is top notch, and lots of features for the price. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and Bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.Pairing them with my MACPRO was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing. The Bluetooth v5.0 has a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and up to 25 feet away an still connected. The sound clarity and the bass are of the richest quality level of the top end earbuds. The earbuds and the case are extremely water resistance from the description on the packaging, still yet to find out. I found out that I could use the product for about or over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. The Qi wireless charging case is very handy.",5,1,2019-7-30,1,0,0
"I've been using these earbuds for about a week now and so far so good. The sound quality is immaculate, and there is enough bass to my liking. When my phone rings and the earbud is in the case, when I put it in my ear it connects immediately. The fit is comfortable in my ear and that has not always been the case with other earbuds in the past. I haven't charged them wirelessly yet, but they seem to charge pretty fast. Overall I'm a satisfied customer!",5,1,2019-11-7,1,1,1
"I wanted a pair of Bluetooth earphones for office use. I did extensive research on Amazon as there are so many options.I decided to go with Tozo and I’m glad i did. For my main purpose os listening to podcast and audiobooks, the earphones meet my expectations. Sound quality is decent, pairing is quick. The built to me is simple yet high quality. I would recommend this product to my friends.",5,1,2019-4-19,1,0,1
"Bought these for working out. Popped them in my ears when I got them, no trouble with connecting them to my droid, and got great sound quality. Much to my dismay, i got ZERO control over the next/back control or the volume from the head phones. Yes it's nice to have a built in mic but it's a HUGE trade off not to be able to control the volume or the  song selection from them. If they didn't have such good bass I would 100% return them for something with more control over the music.Only having the ability to pause/play is extremely irritating when you don't have immediate access to your phone, which I usually don't when working out.",2,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"I really like these headphones. They last on my long walks and are so easy to charge. Just pop them back into their case, they disconnect from your device automatically (which I love), and they charge. I wear them while cleaning my house, and have no problem leaving my phone in one room and still having quality sound. They work well with my Samsung Galaxy S10e or my iPad.My only issue is sometimes the left ear goes in and out during use. It started after a month or so of use. It hasn't deterred me from using them, but it makes me weary of purchasing them again. However for the money, they are good and produce good sound.",4,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"I got these earbuds during a lightning deal for $30. For the price, these earbuds are great. Sound is good, fit is comfortable. Things that would make this product better would include a smaller case and more control from the earbuds themselves (volume, etc.).",4,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0
"These are the first bluetooth earbuds I have owned. The price fit my budget and I was looking for something to wear at the gym. When I tried them out last weekend, I was very blown away by the excellent sound quality, the ease at setting them up on my phone, and also how comfy they are to wear. I have small ears so getting the different size earbuds was appreciated. When I wear these are the gym they stay put- even when i run on the treadmill. I wear these earbuds around the house when i do chores and its an improvement. The range is good too. I wore these when I went downstairs to do laundry ( my phone was upstairs) and the connection was still there. What a great buy!",5,1,2019-9-12,1,0,0
I initially gave this product a 5 star review except that afterwards the first pair lasted a massive two weeks before the left earpiece went completely dead....wouldn't charge or turn on. So I requested a replacement. The replacement pair arrived and on the second day I went to use them the right earpiece was completely dead....again wouldn't charge or turn on. I've owned Bose earbuds and Senso earbuds for well over a year with no issues. Two defective products in a row? I'm done with this product and this company!!!!! DO NOT BUY THEM!!!,1,1,2019-8-28,1,0,0
These are the best wireless earbuds I've had so far. I use these mostly at the gym or when I go for a run and they stay in place without hurting my ears or becoming loose and falling off. Sweat doesn't seem to bother these earphones either so that's a great plus for me.I did experience a problem where one ear bud was louder while the other was muted somewhat. I emailed the seller and they were quick to give me step by step guidance to address the problem and offered a replacement set of earbuds when the troubleshooting didn't work. Stellar customer service.,5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"Wasn't sure what to expect with these. Once I figured out which earbud cover was optimal to seal the ear it has really nice sound! Bass is pretty decent. Easy to use. I love how they auto turn on when you take them out of the case and will connect to your phone right then. Charging case is a really cool way to store them and travel with them and will charge them up a few times before needing to be charged itself. Overall, very happy to have finally ditched the cables!",5,1,2019-1-9,1,1,0
"4 stars action. I previously purchased the T10 and was not as happy. So they sent me another pair. the T6 is updated and improved. My first plus was the multiple ear piece sizes. I was able to find one to fit my tiny ears. The sound quality has improved. They were always good for talking but now it’s works well with music. The base in you music sounds good.  I love the fact that I can use one without the other and the left one independent of the right. So if one dies I can use it.  Customer support provides good communication. Would love to try the sports over the ear to see if the measure up. Overall. I’m happy with this product.So I purchased these T10 at a Black Friday sale. The sound quality is not as good as I would like. They pair quite easily once you take them out of the package. The case charges up pretty quickly. The sound quality is good for making phone calls. When it come to listening to music, they lack base. All of your music sounds like treble no base. You know its all about that base. I often use my iPhone EarPods and they don’t compare to sound quality when it comes to music. The battery does seem to discharge quickly. I only paired the right one per the package.  Not sure if you can use the left one with the right earbud charging in case. I returned them.",4,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I bought these for working out and was worried due to the design they would not be secure. They are, very. Sound is great, they seal out a good deal of ambient noise, they connect immediately out of the case. I haven't worn them for more than 2 hours so I can't attest to the 3 hr battery life but these are a great, mid priced bluetooth earbud no question I would reccommend them.Update: 7/18. I noticed the left earbud would start to cut out, especially during movement. This problem got worse and worse over the weeks, to where the earbuds were unusable. Returned, sadly.",3,1,2019-6-8,1,0,0
"After searching for earbuds for a while, I decided to get Tozo 10. I ordered two, one for my wife and one for me.They arrived a day after I placed the order. I opened the box, followed pairing instructions and after two tries they were paired with my iPhone. I also paired them to my computer. To paire my wife's was very easy. The sound is very good for the price, and noise cancellation is also better than I expected. Good battery life and very quick to recharge. After few months of very satisfying use, the right earbud stopped pairing. I did what the manufacturer asks but it did not work ,So I went to the support link and explained my situation. After a few hours they told me they would send me a new pair as soon as I gave them order number, etc. I am very pleased with their customer service. My wife's are working as new. I recommend the product and the company.",4,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"Was in the market for a pair of earbuds after my bluetooth headphones (which I had for three years) stopped working. Saw the price and the reviews and jumped on it.The sound quality and noise-cancellation are great, especially when at the gym. I cannot hear people grunting or talking even when I have the noise levels up halfway.",4,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
"Worked fairly well when dry as long as both are in. With only the left one, the sound got glitchy, even if the right was on and close. I was okay with that since I only want to use one at a time or I’m deaf to the world. Until the right one started skipping too. Three days after return window closed. Also, although not my concern but others may be interested, they fell out of my ears when they got wet.",2,1,2019-10-6,1,1,0
"I am a principal and I’m always on the go, especially at school. I purchased these earbuds on October 1, 2019. I only had them for one day. I didn’t know these earbuds were so big. I arrived to school with the earbuds in to tackle the day. They were working well while I was talking to my husband on the way to work. I stepped out of the car and disaster struck. My right earbud fell out in the school parking lot and a car ran over it before I could retrieve it! $50 bucks gone down the drain if this insurance doesn’t cover it. I wish I knew these were so huge! I hope the insurance I purchased with the product can resolve this issue. Ill keep my fingers crossed. I emailed them today.",2,1,2019-10-5,1,0,0
"These are definitely the best I’ve owned. They have a case that acts as a charging base (which was a surprise to me), that’ll charge them x4 over and they’re waterproof. If you have a charging mat, they work with that too. I’ve used them at work/home for about a week now and I love them. I had never heard of Tozo, but the reviews got me to try them. Great product!Tested out different genres of music to see how they did and... I was surprised. The bass is more substantial then I thought it would be. The treble is clear and the mid is present without overbearing the highs and lows. There were a few tracks where the vocals “s” sounds were a bit harsh but that didn’t happen for every song. Pretty happy though. Also, these are my first wireless pair. It’s nice not having them get caught on something or needing to adjust them every time I turn my head.  Pretty comfortable. They also come with several ear pieces in case you have larger/smaller ear holes.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

"I ordered this after contemplating what wireless earbuds that would be a product I could look back on and have no regrets getting, I saw some coworkers who had gotten this and were discussing it. After listening to them, I decided to have a go with a purchase since they seemed to highly recommend the product. I was a little hesitant regarding purchasing it due to battery life, but while it says it only lasts 3 hrs of music playback, I realized though use that it never died on me.  This is in part since I can use them close to 3 hours or less than putting them back in the case which charges them up. The sound quality was pretty good that I was a little shocked. It is slightly a little uncomfortable since I am not used to having large earbuds so I pushed them in thinking they needed to go in deeper to be secure. Turns out that by selecting the right size earpiece and just pushing them in with small twists that it fits snug.Overall, it is one good bang for your buck especially for listening while going on lunch or when exercising. I would recommend trying this out before going for those more experience higher-end earbuds.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"Ok so I have an iPhone and was so done with having one pair of earbuds for my computer and another for my iPhone and decided on these:Pros: Fantastic bass, quick and easy pairing, fast charging, waterproof, stay in, long range, very attractive in ear look (not odd looking like AirPods which is why I was looking for other brands, yes I’m vain)",5,1,2019-8-17,1,1,0
"So far so good. I have to admit im not too picky. Im not an audiophile and only listen to audiobooks so it sounds fine to me. What i really like about this is the comfort, its ability to use either left or right ear piece and its charging capability of charging one earpiece without the other. So far i love these Bluetooth earbuds.In the future my review may change based on long term reliability, if it breaks easy after being in the rain, and if the speakers break in time.",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"This review is for the Tozo T 6 wireless, waterproof earbuds.  The earbuds were sent to replace the Tozo T10 earbuds that did not pair well.I find the Tozo T 6 a big improvement over the T10.  The earbuds paired immediately for both ears.  The range and sound are good.  The T 6 comes with several earbud tips to accommodate different ear sizes.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"When I first got it, I thought the product was wonderful because I wanted to be optimistic about it since it was the first time I ever spent so much money on headphones. However, after a few days I noticed quite a few things about these earbuds.They are not made for small ears (even if you change the silicone buds to the smallest size they have): It was very uncomfortable to wear and it did not fit comfortably in my ears. I think it's b/c my ears are so small (even though I'm sure it's normal size), but still it's good to be warned. I could not keep them in long, it was uncomfortable to sleep with and it kept heating up in my ears.",2,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"The earbuds sound pretty good but it's hard to enjoy the sound when you have a constant beeping in your ear every 5 seconds. I've tried disconnecting, reconnecting, reconnecting one at a time, reconnecting both at the same time...... If I only have to use 1 on, I can't get rid of that beeping sound.

"This is my second set of wireless ear buds. The first were very uncomfortable (my ears are a little smaller) and one bud stopped charging. Right out of the box, I love these ear buds.

You just turn on your Bluetooth in your phone, look at what is detected, and sure enough, the icon for the Tozo T10 shows up and you click on it to pair. It even confirms the pairing. Trouble-free and easy. On a full charge, using the Audible app and fitness tracker at an outdoor temperature of 58 degrees F, the T10 earbuds lasted two hours and 42 minutes, upon which they requested a charge. Not bad.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
These earbuds are a great value. The sound quality is excellent. Pairing them with both my android phone and iPod was a breeze. And they fit my ear perfectly right out of the box. They come with multiple sizes if it didn't fit. I've worn these all day for work and half the day fishing and my ear doesn't hurt and they stay in place with only occassionally needing to be pushed back in. My wife loved them too so she bought a pair and she already owned a pair of airpods. The carrying case is nice too. It charges the earbuds very quickly. The feedback is the only thing I can live without. When answering a call or if the battery is running low it announces it and both you and the person on the other line hear it. That is the extent of my negative remarks. Everything else is super positive.,5,1,2020-9-30,1,0,1
"These are easy to pair to your device and they auto pair to each other.  (They even do a stereo check).  Just take them out of the storage box and they turn on and pair.  Watch the video to make sure you properly twist them in your ear.  I'm still trying to make it a habit.  And use the different soft bud sizes to find the right one for you.  It's a little different at first as they feel a bit big, but they have not fallen out while working out, riding a bike, mowing my lawn, etc.  The storage box automatically recharges them and has 4 lights to show how much charge is still left in the box.  So far I've used them all week without plugging in the box and I'm on my last light (1 of 4) of reserve power.  I have not used the headphones from 100% to 0% to truly test the number of hours you get on 1 charge.  You can pause music and answer a phone call with the button on the ear bud, but I don't think there is a microphone and you can't control the volume.  Luckily I have the watch that can change songs, change volume, etc.  So it's not a big deal for me.  Overall I enjoy the product and the price is great!",5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
The headphones took me a little while to get to work. The first time I tried pairing them with my IPhone I could only hear out of one headphone. I placed them on the charger for a little while and took them to the gym and they paired perfectly. I think they just needed to be charged a little longer. They arrived in brand new packaging on the estimated day of delivery. Setting up the warranty was super easy and I received an email from the company within a couple days of registering my product to thank me for my purchase and offering a wireless charging station. The color I wanted wasn't in stock so I ordered the white ones to get them sooner. I'm very happy with my purchase!,5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0

"I purchased 2 of these units for my wife and myself, primarily for use on long distance air travel.  Sound quality is very close to my older headphones, which were very large and bulky compared to these earbuds.  I like that the earbuds can be recharged several times using the battery contained inside the docking case.  The charge on the earbuds alone was more than enough for our use, but having the extra capacity is appreciated.  Can't speak about the long term durability since I've only had them for about 1 month, but I am currently very satisfied.",5,1,2019-7-12,1,0,0
I just got these headphones yesterday after returning a different pair by another company on Amazon for a similar price and I am so very pleased with this product. The problem with most of these bluetooth headphones is they don't both connect at the same time and I had no trouble with that at all with these. The sound quality is also very good for what these are worth. Fits well and doesn't fall out. They do block out side noise but not to the point that if I have one in and turn off my music that I can't hear anything. The button to turn on and off works really well for answering calls and also pausing and playing music and it is MUCH better than the touch headphones I had prior to these.,5,1,2020-1-31,1,1,0
"The TOZO T10 has a beautiful design and the earbuds are very comfortable for hours of use. The sound is awesome with the deeper bass. There are four sizes of caps, so try all for the best fit. Not sure why the xl are different but worked just fine for me. I have used these earbuds working in the yard, at the gym, walking and shopping, never having to readjust. With the sound level high, the world is tuned out. Lower levels one can have a conversation without raising one’s voice. Having the storage case as a charger is genius. Overall, I am really pleased with my purchase and highly recommend them.",5,1,2019-8-7,1,0,1

Update 3:Customer service was able to show me how to connect a single device. I'm not sure why I couldn't figure that out.

These wireless earbuds are terrific! They are comfortable and have great sound quality for a really good price. They have deep base and clear sounds. They have decent noise cancellation too once you find the right earbud size for your ears.The charging case is lightweight and easy to carry. It’s nice that is has a wireless charging feature and you don’t pay any extra for that like with the Apple AirPods. The earbuds have a nice battery life too and the case provides a few charges,5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
Not too bad. They sound nice and hold well. They stay in during weight training.Edit. So they dont always sit perfectly in their cradle which means they connect to whatever devices they are paired to or try to at least and slowly drain their own battery so when I try to go and use them they are already dead half the time. They also cut in and out as if some sort of connection inside is loose so if I turn my head certain ways suddenly they start failing.,1,1,2020-2-29,1,0,0
"Looked around for some new workout ear phones & found these. Dead the reviews & thought sounds good & a great deal. They were doing a promotion at the time I bought so got them for $29.95. Best deal honestly they cancel noise, great sound quality, waterproof which haven't tried yet! Amazing deal for these considering I looked at far pricier ones. Definitely recommend if looking for sound quality, noise cancelling & price! Love these. My son loved them so much he wants me to buy him a pair!",5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"I am very impressed with these ear buds, they are light weight and fit in my ear very well and do not fall out. Buds come with several sizes of soft silicone tips to find a great individualized fit. They pair to each other incredibly fast and to my phone very quickly as well. The sound quality is great with good bass and clear treble. I listen to both spoken words with pod casts and music and both come in crisp and clear.I have not tested the waterproof capability but do not plan to listen while showering or swimming so I am not very concerned with that. The only suggestion I have is to include volume control on the ear bud - controlling this from my phone is no problem though. Great product and I am very satisfied.",5,1,2019-6-19,1,1,0
"Out of the box, the supplied sleeves did not create a good seal in my ears. If I held them in place, I could tell they sounded very good for the price. I was able to find another companies memory foam sleeves that fit and they made all the difference in the world! They were made by RIYO and I bought the large size. I believe it was $6.99 for 12. If you have a larger ear canal, I highly recommend getting these to enhance the T10’s performance. Very happy with them.",4,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0

"Pros: These headphones are an AMAZING deal. $50? Heck yes. The sound quality is really, really good, (great highs and lows) just make sure you’ve chosen the correct tip size for your ear. The noise cancelling feature relies on that too, actually. And they’re water resistant! I’ve taken showers with them and no issues have been encountered. Have yet to try swimming. Additionally, these earbuds can be charged wirelessly. Pretty cool.Cons: Well... not sure this is even really a con! I ordered the beige/gold ones and they look like tiny schlongs.

"Honestly, these earbuds have surpassed my expectations. Right out of the box, the packaging is extremely high quality and you can tell the seller puts a lot of thought into first impressions. The earbuds themselves are very comfortable and do not fall out of my ears when I'm in the gym or when I'm just casually listening. If they do not fit well at first, then you can try the 3 other sizes of ear pieces that come with the earbuds, I personally need to use the smallest size because all others fall out. Sound quality is as good as an earbud can get, clear notes and easy to hear voices as well as a strong bass. Pairing was extremely easy and another thing that surprised me was the battery life. The case charges quickly and so do the earbuds; the earbuds also hold a very long charge. I was using them one night and forgot they were in my ears while I was watching videos for multiple hours, the battery never died and the quality never faded. The charging case is very well made and the magnets are strong, not to mention the purchase comes with a free 1 year warranty in case anything happens to your earbuds. Final verdict: if you are looking for wireless earbuds, buy these and don't look back. You are getting $200 worth of quality for the extremely fair price of $50 (as of when I bought them).",5,1,2019-8-14,1,0,0
"I really like how discreet and powerful they are, not to mention how adjustable! they charge plugged into my laptop conveniently. Ive had mine for a few months and I think the battery life could be improved. it only lasts an hour of consistent use and the strap it comes with loosens way to easily.  I removed the original strop and replaced it with a lanyard strap. One other downside is that you cant just have one in your ear and the other in the charger; if one goes in the charger they both disconnect from your phone. As for its waterproof ability, i cant speak on that bc I haven't dared to test it. I originally bought these wireless earbuds to use when I cleaned and closed a restaurant I worked at and I still use them daily. I recommend these for anybody looking for affordable bluetooth earbuds that will fit great!",4,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0

Oh yeah definitely cool. All was going well until I double-clicked the earbud button. ""Redialing."" WHAT? I ended up accidentally calling my mom. I checked the manual, and sure enough, these earbuds lack the ability to skip a track! Who thought this was a good idea? Good grief. I had to send these back because I was bound to accidentally call people at least 5X per day. If you can get passed not having this basic feature, then go for it.",1,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0

I have put this through a complete all body work out from top to bottom including running and just love them! 1 small issue is the sweat I get behind my ears after hardcore cardio seem to make the product feel like it will fall out. 9 out of 10 times they don't but I did have to chase one that did after it slipped down the treadmill lol... Overall these headphones absolutely ROCK!!!",5,1,2019-11-21,1,0,1
I don't know how these earbuds get so many good reviews.  I got a pair and the earbuds cannot stay connected to each other! It's a shame cause when they do manage to stay connected the quality is good but they are completely useless when they do not stay connected.  I exchanged my first pair thinking it may have just been a defective pair.  The new pair I received is more of the same and now after reading through the reviews I can see that it is a common issue.  I will now be returning this pair as well.  Buyer beware.,1,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"These earbuds are not what I expected and totally worth more than what I paid for. Pairing both left and right is very easy and you can use them by themselves. I mostly use the left side because I like to use my right for hearing the outside world. With both earbuds in nothing external will mess with your hearing music pleasure. The sound is amazing, a lot better then the apple airpods. At first I was getting ready to give only four stars because they kept falling out of my ear/s but then I realized that I have been wearing them wrong after looking at the video reviews . Now that I am wearing them correctly, I am very happy with my purchase.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,1,0
"These are decent, but not great.  I don't see how anyone could exercise in these things.  First of all, I have tried all the sizes of the little rubber things.  None of them stay in my ears.  Just walking my dogs these things have to be jammed back in at least 10 times during my 30 minute walk.  Try talking with them, and the movement of your jaw will dislodge these things even faster.  Same goes for trying to listen to something during lunch.  They cut in and out occasionally, and I have done a re-pair a couple of times and it seems better.  I think if I would have it to do over again, I would get the ones that have the ear loops that go over your ear to hold them in better.  These are sort of heavy in your ears which is why I think they fall out easy.  Sound is pretty good, but it is very unbalanced when one of the pieces starts to dislodge from your ears.  Getting them in the same amount and to stay there is near impossible.",3,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0

"I have been using QuietComfort 35 headphones at work for a few years, but needed something less bulky and cumbersome when exercising.  These earbuds fit the bill. Setup/pairing could not be easier.  It is literally 2 steps: turn Bluetooth on, select earbuds from available devices.  The sound quality on these buds is remarkably good.  It comes really close to the Bose sound quality, especially when using an equalizer app.  It will take some time to get to use to the bud in my ear, but they are not uncomfortable. I don't plan to use these all day like I do with the Bose which are designed for that purpose. For a few hours at a time, these are fine.  Given the price point and the quality, this is a great set of wireless buds that will not disappoint.",5,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0

"I do not recommend these to anyone they do not last long. Not that good for everyday use. They burnt out on me after a couple of months, one earbud went out in the shower  (claims they are waterproof...NOT). And the other one literally burnt out.

"I called my cell provider for help because I was not hearing the rings when I made a call, nor could I hear the person when they answered unless I put phone on speaker.  I was not hearing my alerts and notifications either. I thought it was a phone problem. Not. It was the bluetooth connection with these buds. The inconvenience is that you have to turn them off when not in use or all of your audio continues to go through them! I thought they would disconnect when I put them back in the case. They should...my granddaughter's Airpods do. No switching on and off.  I know it's not a huge thing, but it was a step I did not want to have to remember to do every time I used them and then put them away.",3,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"The quality of these headphones is something that is pretty awesome, in that fifty dollars can get you something that will in theory, do the job. But my concern with these headphones was three decent sized problems.The headphones themselves are not very comfortable. I have average ears. I have not come across many sets of earbuds or headphones that feel awkward or difficult to wear. These earbuds do not feel good though. They also have a huge problem of sliding out, no matter what position I place them. I attempted the different size inserts, and they also had similar effects. This has not been a problem on other brands. I have since switched to the JBL Free X and they fit without any issues and have thus far been extremely comfortable.",2,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0

Company was in contact with me about the product and is sending a new set.

Bought these for myself a few months ago and now everyone in the family got a pair too. They're bulkier than the more expensive options and the case is almost too big to pocket but they sound great and hold a good charge. They've got more volume than other wireless buds I've used (Jabras) and more bass too. They use a standard diameter for replacement tips so they accept memory-foam tips just fine. With the tips aiding in noise isolation they sound even better. I've had no issues using these daily for a long time.,4,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0
"The sound quality is fine, and for the price I definitely can’t complain. I love the look of the earbuds and I like having the charging case. However, the earbuds are very uncomfortable and top-heavy, causing them to flip out of the ear very easily.One of the most annoying things about these earbuds is the stupid button controls. There is no way to control volume or skip a song. Instead, double clicking the button REDIALS YOUR MOST RECENT CALL. Who would want this? Furthermore, both earbuds have buttons—but the controls are identical. This seems like a waste to me. If one earbud controlled volume and the other could pause/skip/rewind music, these would be great. Instead, both earbuds have stupid controls that only sometimes work.",1,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0

I only use for about 1-2 hours at most at a time so can't speak to use-life, but the sound quality is great. It also stays linked so as soon as you put them in your ears they are connected. No wasted time monkeying around with BT connections on every intended use. I don't think they are noise cancelling, which is why I gave it 2 stars, but technically once they are in I cannot really hear anything else so that's why I still gave it 2 stars. I would definately recommend these to anyone looking for a good pair of workout earbuds that hold a charge, have a case, and sound great.",4,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
"These were my first pair of Bluetooth ear buds. I had Bluetooth headphones previously, but they broke. I miss them. The cons to my old headphones were the size and that I couldn't sneakily listen to music at work but aside from that I loved them. I bought these to replace the headphones. These ear buds are tiny and convenient to carry around, they have decent battery life and ok sound quality. The cons though, I'd say 85% of the time I have to manually connect to my phone, sometimes only one ear bud connects and not the other so I have to try again. They also disconnect all the time and reconnect a second later, and it's annoying because it talks and tells you you've been disconnected/you've been connected(it was only a second!aaah!!! ) . Also, if your battery is at 10% it'll start interrupting your audio every 30secs telling you you have low battery. It's really annoying, I can see the battery life through my phone, I don't need it to tell me and keep repeating it every 30seconds especially at 10% I still have some minutes of life leave me alone. I give it 3 stars just because I find the interruptive talking annoying and they don't connect right away.",3,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0
"Used it with my Galaxy S6 and returned it the next day. The sound quality was nothing of note, it did it's job when I was walking the dog.

"I am not an audio pro, I only know good sound when I hear it. I have been loyal to $15 S*ny earbuds for a long time because they where the only ones that play the deep base notes. It’s the frequency range I believe. Most ear buds have a range of 20-20,000 hertz. S*ny’s went from 8-20,000, thus playing the deeper base notes in music.My test song is “How to Love” - lil Wayne. In the chorus there is a diving base chain that reaches a note that a lot of audio equipment won’t play. Or it’s poor quality of you do hear that lowest note.",5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,1
"This product was for my husband since he travels for work and needed hands free calling. We wanted an alternative to the very expensive Apple air buds. Although the design and concept are nice, they didn’t fit as comfortably as expected and seemed to fall out easily. They do come with different size ear “plugs”, so that could be user error. The sound quality was decent and battery life also ok, not superb.Although the product itself isn’t great, for the price I think it’s fair compared to the market and we have friends that recommended these.",4,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0
"My first pair were bought almost a year ago and they were fantastic. I used each earbud separately and each lasted consistently about 4 hours. I lost one of the pair, so I was quick to replace with an identical set. However, the new set does not last nearly as long. I am lucky to get two hours on each earbud and sometimes I only get one hour. The charging case on the new set always has the battery-level lights lit up, which is annoying and wastes battery. In the end, I may opt for another brand when I buy a new replacement set.",3,1,2020-6-14,1,1,0

"Considering the low price, these would be great earbuds if the battery life wasn't awful.

This is relatively moot, as Bluetooth doesn't work very well through water anyway.That aside, the sound quality isn't as good as Airpods, but the battery life is pretty comparable and they look pretty sleek.

The headphones would disconnect and reconnect every 20 seconds or so. That kinda ruined my run. Also double tapping the headphones while one will call the last person you talked to instead of just moving to the next song. So I got put into a very uncomfortable phone call with a girl that just broke up with me, and last but no least they broke after very light use.  Couldn't I have gotten just a bad pair? Sure, but I'm not buying these again. Sidenote: why in gods name do these headphones call people with a double tap? Every other pairs of headphones just moves to the next song.

"Theses earbuds fit and sound great. Battery life is really good. However, I’ve been having issues with the charging case. The original case it came with stopped charging the left ear bud. I wrote amazon and was sent a new case. Now the second case is giving me similar issues. It seems that the charging contacts just aren’t strong enough so the earbuds can come out of position in the case causing them to not be charged. With little movement, connection is made and they start charging again. This is causing the charging case to constantly be in need of charge. For $50, it can be dealt with for the few times a week I use them. If you are looking for everyday use, spend more money on something of better quality",3,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0

I will say, I hate the noise cancelling. Not because it's bad, but because its TOO good. My housemates are evil and like to scare me. They are able to come into my room and just watch over my shoulder for minutes until I notice..I do have a few critiques though. I wish that when you where adjusting the volume using the bud, it wouldn't do the beep. Its not a huge thing, but I'm just not a huge fan. And I wish that when you where skipping or going back to a song it wouldn't say foreword or reverse. Little things that would just be nice to have ironed out in the next version maybe.",5,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0

They came with the generic size which I feel is a normal ear size. I do a lot of cardio and they slip out every 3-6 minutes. It’s so annoying. The tutorial video they advise you to watch, suggests you twist the bud in your ear. I can twist it all day and still slips out of my ear. The sound is ok, but very very basic.

She loved not have to mess w/ connecting wires from her set she usually uses and only had to re-adjust them one time to make sure they were secure. Were super easy to sync up with phones...and for about $40 are a great bargain compared to more well known brands.

The earbuds also come with four different sized caps so you get a good fit. When you remove the earbuds from the charging case, they immediately power on and pair. You can also turn the earbuds on/off manually and they will then pair. The sound quality is good - I'll be using these for running - and wanted a little more bass - and these seem to fall in a good spot for that so far.

"Tried it the first time and it kept disconnecting and trying to reconnect to another device that was not paired to it. So I thought it was a faulty device. Company exchanged it and this time the earphones won’t let me answer phone calls, and it kept saying forward, and my conversations were not heard from people that I had on the line. Had to return it, tried as much to work with them since they had high reviews. Company is great overall, just the product was not what I expected.",3,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"I've had these now for just over 3 months.Positives - The price is great. They have good sound. I don't know what I expected for price, but the sound on these exceeded my expectations. The extra rubber ear pieces make it so you can really set them in your ear well. I like the charging case and the idea that I can carry it with me to give an extra bit of charge if needed.",3,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"The sound on these are amazing, I was nervous because these are not the expensive kind so I wasn’t sure how well they were going to work, but wow. Im super happy with the purchase and product. They do say noise cancellation, I can hear a lil noise but not too much. It also states you can take calls with these but when I tried it, the person said I sounded really far away. For me that is not a deal breaker though because I really got these to listen to my music and stuff without having a wire in my way.",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
I took a while to decide which EarPods to buy and looked at a few before I settled on Tozo.  I tried my youngest sons AirPods but they weren’t comfortable in my ear and kept cutting out during phone calls.  I considered buying the new AirPod Pro but my experience with the original AirPods discouraged me....not to mention the hefty price.  My oldest son told me about the Tozo EarPods and asked for them for Christmas. We both fell in love with them. The sound quality is amazing and definitely better than the AirPods in my opinion.  I have to use the smallest ear piece and these fit very secure and comfortably in my ear. I travel a lot so this is perfect for me to use use on the plane.  Great quality for the price.  We now are a Tozo family - I have purchased one for each member of the family.,5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"The fit and function of the earbuds are good.  With different size cushions you can custom fit to your specific needs.  Sound quality is good, but lacks a bit of bass punch in my opinion.  I travel a lot and use them for listening to audio books and music.Touch controls are simple (pause/play, on/off and answer call), but effective.  I've tried earbuds with sensitive touch response, and was accidentally pausing, fast forwarding or some other function when I reached up to adjust the earbud in my ear.  Pairing with my phone was very simple.",4,1,2019-7-13,1,0,0
"Everything about this ear bud is outstanding. The sound has great midrange and bass, the 5.0 Bluetooth reachability is amazing, the ear fit is perfect and the case battery life and wireless charging technology is excellent!!! Being waterproof is a big bonus.. I use it on the jacuzzi with confidence while doing my hot water therapy. The technology of this product is soooo far more superior to that of JBL Free (which I returned by the way after using the TOZO T10).  This is now my headphone of choice while watching movie on my IPad in bed, instead of my Bose QC35 II.  Great for outdoor hikes as well. I just wish TOZO will send me another one of these as a New Year present ...lol",5,1,2018-12-30,1,1,0
"Sound quality sounded great for the first few uses. After that, it seems to have dropped pretty significantly. They cannot handle the “bass booster” equalizer on Spotify without sounding like crap. These are what I’d consider average sound quality these days.While working out in a crowded gym, the Bluetooth is virtually useless. Sometimes I’ll get through an entire song without the music cutting out, other times it cuts out every 5 seconds. Very frustrating.",2,1,2019-3-23,1,1,0
"Thank you, TOZO, for an actually affordable option for non-Apple users! These earbud have been perfect for several projects we are doing around the house-- I don't have to listen to the sandpaper and I can easily distract myself while watching the paint dry! But in all seriousness, these earbud are exactly what they claim to be, and their customer service is extremely helpful as well. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. They will get back to you ASAP with useful answers to any question.",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"This is my first pair of wireless earbuds and I absolutely love them. The smallest size is a comfortable fit for my ears. They feel like a solid product and I love the charging case. The sound quality is great and even has some noise cancelling since they fit so well. So far, battery has lasted a lot longer than I thought, and I don’t charge them every day. I’ll use these a few hours a day with little fatigue in my ears. Awesome product!",5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,1
These earbuds have high quality audio. They have great noise cancelling capabilities. I can use them for around 4 hours per charge. I tend to get probably 3 charges off the case. The only complaint I have is that twice now the tip came off the device in my ear. I had to pull it out and reattach. If it wasn't for that I would give 5 stars. They are very durable though. This happened when I was mowing. The front tire of the lawn mower ran over the hard device piece and it still is intact and works get as well!,4,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"Bought this to replace my last pair of Bluetooth wireless headphones (from a different brand, bought on amazon). Compared to that one:Noise canceling & sound quality is good. But I hate how this pairs. You pair the left to the right and pair the right to the device. It’s not optimal. Pushing button may cause redial last number which is a weird feature. Pairs really weirdly and sometimes disconnects. If one pairs first then second one pairs to it.",3,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
"I got these for my husband who is a touring musician here in Nashville. Here’s what he had to say:I’m picky about my headphones because of being a musician, and I was really impressed with these. While they’re not as good as higher end In ear monitors, for the money, they’re perfect for what I need and much better than my wired headphones that came in the box. Very happy with the quality for the price.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"OMG!!!! Absolutely love, love, love these headphones!!!! Sound is amazing. Fits perfectly in my ear. So comfortable that when you pause your music you forget there are in there. Battery life is amazing and I love that I can just sit them down on my wireless charger to charge hassle free. Pairs up as soon as you take out of the charger without having to touch a button. I am so proud of myself for finding theses. I’m telling everyone I know.💗",5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
"After using these for a while, I've come to really depend on them for my commute. The sound quality is pretty great for what you're paying for. They don't really cut out outside noise unless the volume is on full blast. However, my biggest complaint is the audio skipping. I really wish I understood why this happens, especially when they're fully charged, but the audio seems to skip. Hiccup is probably more accurate. It's very odd since it happens in two different ways. One is a straight up skipping of the audio where you'll miss lyrics or beats. The other sounds more like a hiccup in quality. It'll drop tones and come back sounding muffled or grainy. It can be really annoying especially when you've found your groove with a song and it happens 5 or 6 times in a row.Like I said, they're a decent pair for the price point and are great when they actually work. I'm just hoping this is a manufacturer defect or something.",3,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"honestly these are the best affordable Bluetooth headphones. I thought about purchasing the airpods and the airpod pros but knowing that apples regular headphones don't stay in my ears I was going to pay 150$ for them. I currently have two pairs of these headphones. I got my first pair about 1.5 years ago and they still sound great (even after some slight munching on from a puppy).  One pair I leave at work so I can watch YouTube and listen to music while I'm working and my lunch break walks. The other pair I use for home, working out, running, gardening etc. I decided to get another pair for home because I'm very forgetful and tend to leave the other pair at work. They are excellent at canceling noise while I'm working out or when my parents are attending zoom meetings. I've called friends/family with them in and they say that the audio on calls is similar to the quality of car Bluetooth. Overall I'm very impressed with these head phones and I am ecstatic that I got two pairs for half the cost of airpods. If they ever die I will definitely be repurchasing them.",5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
"Bought this product to go for runs because wired headphones never seemed to work for me, and over-ear headphones were too bulky to use outside or on the treadmill. It worked very well for the first 3 months - great sound quality, no crackling, and decent battery life. I didn't buy it for the noise cancelling, but it did the job I needed it to do. The fit of the headphones, even with the smallest ear caps, was uncomfortable and I had to frequently adjust it during my runs. My major problem with this product is that it suddenly stopped working one day, and I was not able to fix it. The right earbud refused to connect to the left, and it wouldn't connect with my device either. I tried resetting it to factory settings, making sure both of the earbuds were charged, and forgetting them from my device, but none of these worked. I reached out to Amazon product services, who did what they could. It still was not fixed, so I ended up returning it after the 30 day period. Works in the short-term, but not great in terms of durability.",3,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"Sound quality for these earbuds is amazing. I was not expecting the clarity to be so precise. There is also the perfect amount of bass. When I have both ear buds in my ears the noise cancelation is top notch. I have so much trouble hearing anything else. The only con I would have to say is tge battery life. While they do have a case that recharges quickly, I would like to use them longer than 2-3 hours. This was the case when I connected to my computer. They seem to last longer connected to my phone. I love that I can use each ear bud separately to extend the usage time. Overall very pleased with this product!",5,1,2020-10-1,1,0,1
"I purchased the T10 on December 2, 2019.  The sound is great!  But, since that time, they have been unable to pair on numerous occasions.  I have always powered them off, reset them and reconnected to BT without issue. Now, when I try to reset them, the left earbud light turns purple but the right keeps flashing and never turns purple.  I am able to connect to BT but there is only sound coming out of the left side.  After about 2 - 3 minutes, the right earbud turns off.  However, I can still hear out of the left one when watching videos.  Unfortunately, since the right earbud doesn't produce sound, I can no longer use it for phone calls.  I contacted TOZO and they are replacing them for me.  Great customer service!EDIT 7/4/2020: Upon contacting TOZO, they immediately replaced the earbuds.  I wanted to wait a while before updating this review to see if the replacement works better than the original purchase.  So far, so good!  Again, great customer service!",4,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"Received these from my wife as a late bday present. The pairing process is SUPER EASY (at least on android) and they came already charged so I was able to test them out right out of the box. The sound quality is pretty good for the price (and for being bluetooth), tho really strong bass which might be a plus (had to adjust my phone's EQ settings to bring bass down a bit).However, the fit is a bit complicated. I read a lot of reviews on how to make them fit properly so they don't fall out, but even wearing them around the house (no exercise, no jumping around) they start to come out little by little. Still trying out different ear caps to see which one is the best for me, but definitely keeping them.",4,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
"These ear buds are amazing from the design and use of the charging case to connecting with any device.  I like that they operate seamlessly when you take them out of the case by turning on and automatically connecting with each other and then once paired which is easy, they connect each time with your tablet, phone etc. without a problem.  You can use one ear bud or both they have great sound and they fit the ear perfectly without discomfort from prolonged use.  Definitely great tech for the $$ highly recommend them if you are looking for this type of audio deice.",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0

My old pair of Skullcandy Method Sport earbuds sounded better than these for half the price.  There's also a noticeable delay if you're using these to watch shows/movies, which was another reason I decided to return these in just a couple days.

When they were new, they constantly re-acquire for the first few minutes of use but would mellows our after like 10,12 min.

However bluetooth range probably the worse in its kind (less than 15 feet) sounds spotty and lost connection outside 15 feet range.

"Updated 09 OCT 2019 - received the replacement earbuds quickly and packaged perfectly!  Unfortunately, they have the exact same issue as the original ones... they work and sound amazing inside, but as soon as I go outside the left earbud breaks up.  These would be great if I only wanted them for inside, but that isn't the case.  Sending these back as well....This is a perfect example of ""I should have read the reviews.""  I was initially very happy with these earbuds.  Charging and connection were pretty seamless, sound quality and noise cancelling (while initially wearing them in the house) was great!  During my first attempt to wear them while walking outside, the left earbud kept going in and out (as described in so many other reviews).  I unpaired and repaired, as well as unpaired from other devices, thinking it may reset the earbuds and possibly eliminate interference... but no change.  After returning home I reset the earbuds per the instruction manual and again they worked great inside the house...but just walking into the backyard made the left earbud fade again.",1,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0

"These buds have great sound if you can keep them in your ear. The concept is good, but the functionality isn't. The buds are heavy and fall out easily. The need to constantly rotate them back in is annoying. I guess the point of them being waterproof is just in case they fall out of your ear while your near a body of water. It's a no-go for me.",1,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
"Not a fan- I am switching over to some other brand, though I haven't made a decision on which yet. After having these and using them for  about a week, they have fallen out constantly, have poor sound quality and poor battery life. I am outside working all day, with a decently physical job, in addition to my workout routine. Any amount of sweat, moving around or even when chewing and they fall out! I tried all three sizes of the inserts and none fixed the problem. Only perk is that they did actually work, which the the highest praise i can give these headphones.",2,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
"The TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds are simply put, a quality product. I have always been one to take my music seriously and I tend to listen to a progressive jazz and mood music. From the first time I received and placed these in my ears, WOW! the sound was amazing and with such pure clarity and excellent bass! Now since I like to tailor my music sound, a few moments setting my equalizer for my music app on my phone and bam! I was enjoying my music in all the crystal clear highs and lows I could take in. The bass is also amazing. I used to play bass guitar so i tend to enjoy a greater amount of bass in my music and these earbuds do not disappoint. I have had expensive headphones in the quality range of Bose and Harmon Kardon and these little earbuds will hold their own! In summary, this was a great purchase I would highly recommend.

I have worn blue tooth headsets and but I thought I'd give wireless a try, but since I am a runner was afraid of losing, so I figured I will try with a inexpensive set first before purchasing a ""higher end"" set. I think I will keep my money and just stay with the Tozo10s. I've run with them and the noise cancelling is awesome. The rich bass really comes through. IPX8?! What?! For the money so far, this sounds as good if not better than the Jaybirds I have. Excellent, can't go wrong here!",5,1,2019-2-18,1,0,1

The charging case is substantial with magnets that hold the earbuds secure and the case closed making the earbuds easy to charge, store and take with you in a bag or pocket.

"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.",4,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"Great sound( frequencies, sound stage, sound balance). What I found is, depending on the phone it is paired with will affect the Suns quality. iPhone XS Max with google music ( highest streaming) bass was overwhelming, but with a music app that adjusts the EQ , you can these earbuds sound great. With Samsung Note 10, it Is great with no adjustments. Bought master&dynamics, more going to return the $300 earbuds for a $50 pair. If sound quality matters over features, try these.  The only problem I have with them is the fit, the tips are too bulky for my ear, can’t get a solid fit all the time, but when I do, oh boy, great sound.",5,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0

But, what was most impressive is the sound, just amazing. So crisp and clear. I could hear every detail in the music. I have only had the TOZO T10 earbuds for a day and I have been bragging about them to friends and co-workers. I look forward to more and more awesome music.

Tozo doesnt get a fair enough shake. They fixed the issue I had with the ear rubbers. I honestly haven't used these buds much but their newer 6. Is a great bud. I spend alot of money on air buds I can tell you their closely comparable to Sony and samsung... samsung has superior battery life by double. But only this bud can I drop in a glass of water and still work. CRAZY RIGHT.  Go running or wanna use in a shower these just dont work but still charge without a dry time..,5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
I cannot believe the sound quality on these ear buds. The sound is excellent! The design is sleek and looks beautiful in the black case. The buds are very comfortable and feel very secure in your ear. They are very inconspicuous and do not have that embarrassing look that AirPods have. I would bet that these ear buds are superior to Apple's new AirPods Pro. I definitely recommend you get yourself a pair.,5,1,2019-6-15,1,1,0
"This is the first pair of truly wireless earbuds I’ve ever bought. And I have to say, I was NOT expecting them to sound this good! The bass and treble are both astounding; the bass is perfectly loud but isn’t “muddy” or overdone, and the treble isn’t “tinny” or anything. Really fantastic sound quality.The case is also very well-designed, with magnets that allow the earbuds to “snap in” and stay secured to the charging terminals, as well as magnets that keep the lid snapped shut when it’s closed.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0

He says, literally no sound comes through when on the mower from outside - no issues from sweating....amazing battery life.......WELL worth every bit of the money that we paid at a fraction of the cost of name brands.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0

They also provide extra sizes so you can choose which one fits best! The sound quality is really good, really nice and clear as if I were just holding the phone up to my ear. It’s not muffled and it doesn’t sound like the other person is far from the phone. I also like that it’s noise cancelling when I need a break from all the chaos, I can just put these right in and listen to music. They also include a charging cord and a string to make the case a lanyard. It was super easy to pair and learn how to use. My husband bought a different pair a while back and I don’t like his because it’s just touch to answer and hang up, but this one is an actual button. You do have to press it a little hard but it’s not that big of a deal, I’d rather have the button than the touch because I would always accidentally hang up when I would have to adjust the ear buds when I used his.

These are high quality Bluetooth earphones for the price! I ordered one last week that claimed to have good sound quality and ended up returning because it was horrible. However these really live up to expectations! Safe to say we can’t expect the same quality as the Beat earphones for $30. I think it is a fantastic buy and I’m glad I decided to buy these!I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it seemed to be kind of spotty on cloudy days.

"I wish I could give zero stars. I received well packaged and new. But after the first full charge I noticed four blue lights would not go away, which is odd, but nevertheless it did not really bother me, I figured they are one for each full charge they claim it gives to earphones. I started using the earphones and every time I used for maybe 1 hour max and put them back in the box only to find out that after each time I put them in the box one blue light is gone. I did not want to believe what I am thinking is right and kept testing. They really do go away every time I use for short time (sometimes 30 minutes) and put them back in box. Still thinking that I might be wrong and those lights indicate something else I fully charged the box with earphones in again. All four blue lights came one and stayed on after plugged out. Started using the earphones for short spans (20 mins, 30 mins and 1 hour max) and kept putting them back in box after use, the lights started going away and they were all gone the second day. Overall I got 4-5 hours of active listening from both earphones and box charge. This is ridiculous. Contacted amazon and they offered to return. Thought they gonna send me a return slip, but apparently I have to go and drop it off at a location to get my refund. What a headache.",1,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0

I was even skeptical of their claim to be waterproof, but once I actually tried wearing them in the shower, I realized they were right! The headphones worked amazingly while in the water and after.Unfortunately, after a few months, one side did stop working, but I have a feeling that was more due to my lack of being careful with the product. I reached out to the Tozo company about the issue and they were really helpful. They suggested some tips on how to get them working again from home and were completely understanding when I still couldn't manage to turn it back on.

They sent me reset instructions, I followed it step for step but was still experiencing the same problem. I contacted them again and let them know I was still experiencing the same issue. In the reply email was a response they were sending me a new pair out and I would receive them in 7 days. They arrived in 3 days and I have not had a problem with the new pair! The person on the other end of the email was very pleasant and easy to deal with as I am a very busy person, I prefer email as I can get to it when I have the time.If I need, I would buy from them again.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"I was having all sorts of connection issues with the Bose wireless earbuds. Returned them and got these at a 1/4 of the price. The sound is awesome. Good deep bass, like Bose. THe connection is much easier. I am still running into the issue if I am listening to music and I get a video call they don't always stay connected to the call, but if I put them in case and take out again, they connect right away. For the money, I am much happier than with the Bose for a lot more. And they fit well in the ears too.",5,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"I purchased these for my kids, my mother in law, and myself. I love that they are wireless and have a long battery life. The only thing I didn't notice is that you cannot use these for phone calls. I have tried several times and the other person couldn't hear me. I do love these earbuds as I can use them in my ears at work and tune out the annoying coworker. I just wish they didn't stick out so much and I also wish I could use them in a call. Overall a good purchase.",4,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
Pretty great for the price you pay! They are definitely noise cancelling. They pair very quickly and DONT FALL OUT when exercising which is so nice compared to others (AirPods). Not having a wire is great too. It’s unfortunate you can’t control the volume or sound selection and a little difficult to press the button on the headphones when they are in your ear but I don’t mind because I always wear my Apple Watch and can control the volume and song selection from there super easily. If you don’t have a smartwatch though that may be annoying. I’d definitely try them though!,5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"I love to use these earbuds when I work out and they're so comfortable and fit perfectly in my ears. The sound quality is excellent and I really prefer the design of these to the Apple AirPods. I say this because these earbuds come with the silicon earpieces so they are much more comfortable (I've always preferred the silicon material). Overall, I'm really satisfied with this product. So if you're searching for inexpensive wireless earbuds that are high quality, this is exactly what you're looking for!",5,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0
"the title mostly says it all. Bought a pair for my husband to use with his work laptop and the connection was so choppy that it would straight up disconnect him from meetings. Thought the computer might have been the issue, so tried them again with several other bluetooth devices only to encounter the same issue.  Thought the pair was defective so opt to do an exchange with amazon for another pair. Opened them up and tried them out, same exact issue on all devices. Used my AKG wireless headphones to make sure the devices all even worked with wireless headphones to behin with, they do.These headphones have become one of the biggest disappointments I have ever purchased.. I was so looking forward to loving them, but cannot.",1,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"I love the sound the TOZO T10 Bluetooth ear buds make, and really wanted to give a five star, but the size of them are HUUUGE!! They are so heavy that if I eat, they fall out, after about ten minutes of just sitting there with them in, they lose suction and begin to fall out. I wish I didn't buy them and waste my money.If you have huge ear canals, these are great. But those with a standard ear canal size, don't waste your money.",2,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"I got these earbuds for my son's birthday and they stopped working within a month of getting them. A glitch occurred where they would attempt to connect to his phone even while they were in the charging case, meaning they would never actually charge while they were in their case.

"I love these ear buds.  I've had them for almost two weeks and have used them every day.  I love listening to audio books, but if I just listen to them on my iPhone speaker my mind wanders.  It doesn't when I used head phones.  These are light weight, easy to use, and, unlike two other pairs that I've had, they really are wireless.  The sound is really good.  They are also comfortable - but I with there was an even smaller end than the ones they have.  I have very small ear canals and it takes a bit of effort to get the buds into my ears.  They are reasonably priced and still really good.",5,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
"These earbuds are AMAZING!!!!!!! I own a pair of Apple buds and they are great.  But, I am not a fan of white, and I wanted to try out a pair of black ones before I bought the pros.  So I took a chance and read some reviews  These honestly sound much better than my Apple 🍎 buds.  They are so crisp and extremely loud.  They are my new favorite!!!!

"Really good earphones. I'm not interested in spending hundreds on EarPods, but I wanted to have a wireless pair available for occasional listening to music and work calls. These do the job and cost a lot less than EarPods. My only complaint is the fit. They are not very comfortable if you keep them on for a while and even the smallest cover that comes with the set feels like it's putting too much pressure on my ear after wearing them for a while. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase.",4,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"I have been testing out many headphones/ear pieces over these past few years commuting to work in the DC/Virginia area. I have about an hour commute each way and usually am listening to an audiobook, or enjoying some music as therapy for the gnarly traffic and the crazy drivers that get your blood pumping.Bluetooth wireless earpieces are a must now with the audio port gone from the iPhones. My experience has been that connecting up the phones is not always easy. The TOZO T10 ear pieces seem to connect with ease-- only one ear piece needs connection and the other will join in with ease. Good on TOZO.",5,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0
I like the fit of each bud.  I was skeptical at 1st if they would stay put while working or playing.  They do. I didn't have to change out the rubber ear pieces .  The ones on the buds fit just right.  The bass is amazing but the treble is a little weak.  The battery life so far has been about 3 hrs between charges on the base unit.  That is less than my old wireless jlab set that would go 5+ hours.  Maybe these will get better.  Noise cancellation is extremely good.  I can't hear my work hand held radio and have actually missed calls addressed to me because of the cancellation.  I have to loosen them in my ears just so I won't miss any more radio calls.,5,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
I love the freedom of no cords. I love that they're water proof but they're a little bit big and they fall out of my ears a lot. They seem to be too big for my ears. Today I was happily sitting on the toilet listening to something. As I turned to flush one popped out and fell into the toilet and away it went. 😥 I'll try the smaller version which I think might be the T6 because I really did enjoy them for the few weeks I had them.  Just don't wear them on the toilet folks! 🤦🏾‍♀️,4,1,2020-1-20,1,0,1

"I am a 72 year old grandmother and I dearly love my TOZO T10 earbuds.  I am Apple person from the very beginning, but when I saw my husband’s Apple wireless Airpods, I thought he looked like an alien!🤪. I have found my TOZO earbuds easy to pair to each other and to link to my iPhone and iPod.  The enclosed instructions were clear and understandable.  The wireless feature is important for me,  as I use these earbuds while I am knitting and there are no wires to to get tangled with the yarn.  I also like the wireless feature when I walk outside or am doing household chores.  I listen to my own music from Pandora, my subscription radio shows both live and in a podcast format as well as to the audio books that I listen to from the Audible App.  I do not plan on testing them them in the water, nor can I comment on noise cancellation.  I very much like the convenience of use, the portability and being able to others things while enjoying a fine listening experience at the same time.  It is of great use in my retirement years.

"There are 0 complaints, except maybe that my sister likes them too, guess I will be having to share these. The price is amazing for the comfort as well as the sound, and battery life! I could get one set of AirPods for 3 of these, in my opinion they look, probably feel better, and sound just fine, I could ge a pair of wired earbuds for $40! My opinion, some of the best out there. Plus it gives you 4 different sizes for your ears!",5,1,2019-11-30,1,1,0
The earbuds have great sound and battery life. The only problem I had was that the earbuds can’t get a snug fit in my eat. Causing them to fall out of my ears no matter what I do. I contacted customer service and the only thing they said was for me to buy different silicon ear pads. Their are no attachments for the earbuds to fit better besides what I was told. I refuse to buy new parts for earbuds that I just bought. Good luck with earbuds fit in your ears.,2,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"They fit well, and stay in place with whatever you are doing. Haven't had an issue with movement yet. The pairing process can be a bit funky at times, and I have to place them back in the holder on occasion to get them to pair and connect correctly, but only a slight issue and one I am sure happens with whatever earbud you might be using. The sound is ok, kinda heavy on the base, but most people seem to like that when working out which is what I use these for mostly. I don't notice the base nearly as much when I am listening to an audio book though. As far as connection, I have noticed a random dropping of connection for like a split second sometimes. Usually it is because I have moved from my phone or the battery is low. Over all, I recommend especially if you are not sure if in the ear wireless earbuds is the way you want to go.",4,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0
I absolutely love these headphones! They sound really good the last pair of headphones I had was Powerbeats 3 but my cat chewed the cord so I bought these for my birthday! I have to say these do a really good job of staying in my ears once I switched to the smallest ear pieces.  I can’t hear anything around me which I like so people do t talk to me lol. It also looks like you aren’t wearing any headphones. Down side is that you can’t skip or replay through the headphones you can only pause . You can use Siri to change your music if you don’t want to pick up your phone. The other downs side they don’t hold a charge for long about 2 1/2 hours. So always have your case charged. They do charge pretty fast though so that’s a plus. Other than the battery life and unable to skip or replay music the sound is really amazing I’m not mad about this purchase at all!,5,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0
"I took the plunge and decided to get bluetooth earbuds, instead of my wired headphones. I looked at the Apple AirPods Pro (I'm an Apple guy), but it seemed like way too much money to spend on earbuds. So, searching Amazon, the T10s came up as having a ton of reviews, the majority of which were awesome. So, I bought them. They paired immediately with my phone, they fit perfectly, and they seem to last a pretty long time. For the price you pay, they are more than worth it. I would highly recommend them.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0

It’s almost like signal was lost for a brief second but it happens intermediately but it’s constant. WTH!? Maybe I do have to spend the $200+ to get some apple AirPods.",1,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0

I even forget there are there sometimes. Other earbuds have given me ear aches or discomfort overtime, but these never have. solid construction and I love that they're waterproof as well. The case is great as well, and it's handy to have the indicator lights to show the charge level. They have better quality with phone calls as well. The people I talked to on the other line say they hear me just fine where as previous pairs have made talking on the phone difficult to understand each other. Even with background noise like driving. I can use voice commands as well. Awesome product for the low price!",5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
"These wireless earbuds are great for the price! I like the sound quality with good base and noise cancellation.  The battery life could be better as you only get maybe 4-5 hours continuous play before needing to charge again but that’s all I need; plus you get about 30 to 50 feet circumference away from the device you are using with Bluetooth.  Overall, great buds for the price.  I would recommend these to anyone.",4,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"I've used a couple other types of bluetooth earbuds in the past but these are my favorite so far. Aside from the fantastic range and depth of sound quality there are a number of features that make this product worthy of all around 5 star ratings.The noise cancelation is impressive in that even without any audio playing there is still a huge degree of external noise dampening similar to that of regular earplugs. With the sound on this is even more significant. Another feature that initially sticks out is that the bluetooth connectivity seems to be very strong and maintains a connection under conditions that would've caused other bluetooth earbuds I've owned to disconnect or cut in and out, but not these. The button on both sides is also very functional and easy to use, not requiring too much pressure to depress. The carrying case itself is also very well constructed and small enough to fit in a pocket while being big enough not to easily lose. The satisfying click it makes when closing the lid is addictive in and of itself!",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0

"Very good quality for the price.  The earbuds are small enough to be comfortable in the ear and come in a sturdy and protective charging case that will also recharge your earbuds.  They paired easily to me Pixel 3.  Good sound quality for music and movies and phone conversations.  Comfortable fit and they didn't fall out during normal wear once I placed the right earbud cushions on the earbuds.  The earbud must be placed in the ear channel for proper fit and to keep the device in place during normal wear.  I tested the noise level from external sources while listening to music and movies on the TOZO T10 Bluetooth earbuds.  They are not noise cancelling.  You can hear noise in the background but most prominent is the audio in your ear.  I had no trouble hearing the words of the music or people talking in movies.  I was able to hear the audio clearly without turning  the volume up to an uncomfortable level in my ear.  I had no trouble focusing on the music or movie because it was the most prominent thing I was hearing.  I bought these for listening to audio media on a plane.  I think that they will work just fine.  During phone call (and video call) conversations, I was able to hear the conversation in both ears clearly.

First, to keep them in your ear you really have to shove them in and it's not painful but it's not pleasant either. Next, to push the button either one you basically have to shove it more into your ear. Last and most important, the connection can be very iffy. The range isn't great and gets blocked if anything is in the way (including a hand).

These are great earbuds for the price. I have to say a couple things though. First the instructions indicate to try all the ear pieces to ensure you get the right ones for you. I started with the ones that came on out of the box. They seemed to fit and be secure in my ear. While using them the sound seemed to be louder in one ear. I could press the less loud one to make it sound the same but it would not stay when I let up on it. I tried the smaller ear pieces and they fit into my ear canal more completely and everything was even and sounded louder. Second, tweak your EQ. They sound was not very good until I adjusted the equalizer settings and it made a world of difference. I would definitely recommend these once I made these changes.",5,1,2019-7-8,1,0,0

I also loved how I could put my phone away and use the buttons on the headphones to turn them off and on, skip songs, or make a phone call. The sound quality is great too. I'm thrilled with these!",5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"I have to say, I was skeptical of these when deciding to buy them.  For the cost of some of the other ones out there, I really wasn't all that sure.  However, these turned out to be a great buy.  I've only had about 2 hours of listening with them, but I think their quality is great.  They fit comfortably in the ear and don't have that ""getting ready to fall out"" feel that others I have worn do.The battery case is nice and sturdy and convienently stores the buds, which are just the right size.  Pairing was a breeze and I can walk around a pretty wide area before the signal gets lost.  My 15 year old Tech son was also impressed.",5,1,2019-7-27,1,0,0
"Update:I tried to work with them and their customer service tried very hard to help me fix my problem.  I have to admit I am impressed by their willingness to help.  Should have contacted them earlier.  When they realize it cannot be fixed on my own, they are willing to send me a new one.  Will update when it actually arrive.",4,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0
"I was really looking for something that had good battery life, excellent sound quality for listening and speaking, and would not fall out of ears, or hurt after little wear. Unfortunately this product didn't deliver on any of these. Sound quality okay/meh for listening, but people had great difficulty hearing me. These often fell out and hurt my ears only after an hour.",2,1,2019-7-29,1,1,0
"I tested the T10 device after it was delivered and was surprised at the quality of the sound. I had low expectations since I was just looking for a true wireless headset to wear and not having to bring my chargera and cable for a ""wired"" wireless one.I may be second guessing this a bit since there is a different model that has touch response. On these are actual buttons and with in-ear headphones it could be dangerous to try and push the buttons. I haven't tested the battery life on these yet but manual says about 3 hours battery life. I listen to music almost all day during work and it's a bit of a bummer but that's to be expected with small true wireless headphones.",4,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"I will never understand for the life of me why someone would pay so much for other wireless earbuds when we live in a world where these exist at the price they do. I enjoyed my previous version of PeohZarr wireless earbuds so much, I decided to give these a try and give my daughter my pair (since her $200 pair of Apple earbuds recently died). Man, these are a step up in every way possible, and for only $10 more than what I had paid for my original pair. I never thought I would want or need a waterproof pair of headphones, but I am honestly excited to try them out in the shower. The sound is richer, and believe it or not, they are actually more snug as well (which I didn't think was possible). On top over all of that, I think they are far more attractive than the longer earbuds that drape down the side of your face. Kudos the people behind this product, as it checks off every box for me. I won't hesitate to make these stuffing stockers this coming Christmas for all my friends and loved ones.",5,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
"These are my first wireless buds so I have no competition to compare with. With that said, these buds are excellent IMO. I love the wireless charging, battery life has not been an issue. The charging case feels solid and is legit, keeps the buds tucked and safe.  If I had known how nice these are then I would have bought much sooner. Delivery time was great. I would order again. Also, get the charging plate by Tozo, fantastic products!",5,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"I wish I could give this product a better review! I love the feel of the earbuds, the look is pretty good and they are comfortable...BUT...the right ear bud continually dies quite a bit faster than does the left ear bud. I usually get about an hour more from the left bud. I've tried connecting them to different devices but continually get the same results. Totally bummed as I was pretty excited about this product!Update: Customer service has been really trying to get this right for me. They reached out quickly and told me they’ve updated the headphones. I’ll give another update once their fix is completed.",4,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"I have have never written a review in my life, but these are so worth the price I had to tell people. I am very experienced in music sound and have purchased top of the line headphones for recording and when I play music live I wear studio headphones. I am late on this wireless headphones thing because I won’t use them much. So I didn’t want to spend a lot of money. I give these a 5 star overall because for the price you are paying, it does not get any better. Have I heard better, of coarse but I paid $499.99. But I’ve also paid for over $150 for headphones that this thing beats hands down. The bass is refreshing and is clear. It doesn’t shake your eardrum but you get to hear and still feel the bass like the artist wants you to hear/feel. Doesn’t noise cancel everything but that does not matter to me. I read reviews a lot so if you are seeing this and you are wanting to buy a headphone that doesn’t break the bank but can still get a good quality sound (better than Beats  earbuds imo) then you need to get these.",5,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0
I was looking for waterproof earbuds and I found them! I use these to listen to music while soaking in a hot tub/spa. I have used them for about two weeks and am pleased with the sound. I accidentally dropped one of them in the spa and it was submerged for at least 30 sec in 100 degree water. It worked ok when I fished it out and after sitting in the charger box for 24 hours it was back to normal. I highly recommend testing out the various size rubber earbuds that are included in with these earphones. I finally settled on the Large size after experimenting with all of them. The bass response is best with a good seal in your ear and finding the right size rubber earbuds will make a huge difference.,5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"Comfort- once you use the right size silicone inserts, they generally won't fall out.Sound- highs and lows sound great!  You will probably have to adjust bass/treble,  better sound than you may be accustomed to.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"Great sound. Haven't gone swimming yet, but i will let you know after I have. UPDATE. When I Got in the pool, I had to duck under a rope to get in the 2nd lane. When I came up they were full of water and fritzed out. They didn't last 30 seconds. Had to return them. They did fine in the shower, but couldn't take full emersion. UPDATE: I am a little upset by this rating system. I thought I was rating the product. I have come to learn that the rating reflects on the seller, not the product. I have changed the rating to 5 stars because the seller deserves it. The product, however, does not. Also, this will be the last rating i will give, unless the seller is really that bad, as i don't care to rate a seller. For me, a rating is to express to other buyers what experience i had with the product. What is the point in giving a 5 star rating and then explaining the product wasn't as expected?",5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
These earbuds are legit.  Excellent sound and battery life.  The case is designed perfectly and even the packaging is excellent.  When the earbuds snap into the case with that magnetic pull ..... for just a second you think Steve Jobs was involved.  I ordered two more pairs for my wife and son after using mine for several days.  The value for your money is outstanding.  Get their wireless charging pad as well.,5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"Although I don't like TV ""news"" because of the blatant anti-America bias, I do love listening to internet news sources - continuously.  These are perfect for listening while at work, walking, shopping, and cleaning the house.  I noticed that one has a stronger sound level than the other, which is not a problem, because I often wear only one at a time.  Now, I can listen to something worth listening to and those around me can't complain.",5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"Five stars purely for the convenience. Extremely easy to use. Pull them out if the box and they instantly start trying to pair. Wireless charging box has worked on every charger I own. Take them out and they're ready to use; put them away and they start charging. Very simple.Sound quality is surprising. Still great even if it's noisy around you, though it may not suppress all surrounding noise. I listen mostly to podcasts and talk on the phone. Everyone has said they're impressed with how I sound.",5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0
Purchased these in April on a whim and couldn't be happier with the pair of headphones. I use them almost daily at work and they tend to last at least a few hours on a full charge. The case is a little bulky compared to airpods but the fraction of the cost for the sound quality makes you easily forget it's in your pocket. Would be 5 stars but my right bud stopped working randomly and is needed to pair with your device. Fortunately a single email to Tozo's customer service took care of the issues and a new pair is being sent free of charge so how could you best that?,4,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"These are my first pair of Bluetooth headphones and they are great! I wasn’t sure if I’d like cordless Bluetooth headphones as I don’t like not being able to use them if I forget to charge them and also they are so little I would probably lose them since they’re not attached to a cord. So I didn’t want to invest a ton of money into a pair. Glad I got these though - I am still afraid of losing the buds but the headphones and case are easy to use, sound great, and stay in my ears. Great price for the headphones assuming their battery life and sound remain decent for a while.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"The product seems to be built fine, sound is great, and the noise cancellation is great as well. However, I rate an overall a 2 simply for the range. With my phone in the house, in a window I can only go about 6-7’ away before the music starts going in and out. If I go any further than 7’, I lose all connection. I would’ve expected a lot better for the distance. UPDATE: Since I have written this review, I would like to add that Tozo has written me an email offering to send me an upgraded pair of earbuds for free and keep the original ones, send me a gift card, or offer me a refund for the product. I of course chose the refund and gave an awesome thank you for doing this. Customer service was on point. I still am keeping the rest of the review because I still feel people should still see what issues I was having, but possibly could be an issue with this particular pair.",2,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"Wow, these are awesome! I've been through about 7 bluetooth headphones and these are the best so far. I was apprehensive about buying these because I'm sure I'm going to lose them but after going through so many different corded versions, I thought I would give these a try. They do not disappoint! The bass and sound are great! I might lose them but for the price they are well worth it. I would buy them again.",5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"I bought two pairs and not one of these worthless piece of S***. It is nothing but Chinese knockoff product. I have tired all the silicon buds provided with it and no matter which one I use, they refuse to stay inside my ears. Thousands of positive reviews got me conned. I am not even able to return these since i got them from the US and i live in the UAE. Beware and don't fall for them. Go for branded ones which are expensive but worth the cost. I got the Jabra elite active 65T which is bang for bucks. I so regret buying these junk funk.",1,1,2019-9-3,1,2,0
"Gave these to our son for Christmas & he absolutely LOVES them. He works out a lot & these worked great for him in the gym (no cords to get tangled, excellent sound, comfortable to wear & convenient case). I can't say about the waterproof, but these have a pretty good battery life & are fairly quick to charge. He says these are the best wireless earbuds he's had so far (and he's gone through A LOT of headphones at the gym). Would definitely purchase these again.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"The sound on these are great and so is the noise cancellation, but I wear them in the gym and they fall out EVERY TIME I USE THEM.

I am going to have to bite the bullet and buy another pair that doesn't fall out which is really disappointing.",2,1,2019-9-5,1,1,0
"This is a really sturdy and well designed product. The noise cancellation was pretty good and pairing was easy. The charging dock is well designed and magnetic. Bluetooth range is great - I left my phone on the second floor and still have a good reception while at the first floor of the house.I would love to keep this item but had to return because my ears are too small. It’s not really meant for petite people or people with small ears lol. I used the smallest earbuds and it worked better than the one it came with, but it still gets loose and I have to keep on adjusting. No issues when I’m not moving tho. Lol",4,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"For the price I cant imagine you could do better. To be fair, I have only had one other pair of wireless buds that were terrible, but I have had some jbl bluetooth I swear by, and compare these to those. If I jam up the sound they cancel noise haha, but otherwise not completely. Some 200$ pair would probably do that, but the sound quality is great, they're very loud also, my wife says the voice on calls sounds good, they're a great buy at 40$.",5,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
"These are great little earbuds for the price you're paying.  I can get a solid few hours out of them before they need to be charged again, the case has enough power for 3-4 full charges and charges itself quickly when plugged into my computer USB.  The sound quality is great, the bass actually surprised me — it's really good, which I wasn't expecting to get out of earbuds like this.Plus, they stay in my ears when I'm upside down doing aerial yoga so that, above everything else, is really what earned them that 5-star rating. :)",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
These earbuds are an excellent value.  They fit nicely and hold without slipping.  The sound quality is very good and I like the fact that they shut off and turn on automatically when placed in the charger.  I've used eight different sets of ear devices including one other set of ear buds and these are the best I've tried.  I don't know if noise cancellation is supposed to cut out all external sounds or not but these still let you hear some outside noise which I prefer.  This is the second set I've purchased,5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
"I got these for myself a few months ago so I could wear one and work and no one would know with my hair down, works like a charm! I consider myself a bit of an audio nerd, I'm majoring in audio recording and engineering and I think the sound is surprisingly full and of high quality for the price. The different sizes that earpieces are very helpful, and these actually stay in my ears when apple earpods do not. They are comfortable, and the battery life is great! I rave about them so much my coworker has a pair and I just bought a pair for my tech-snob husband. He loves them and is using them every day. A great buy, definitely recommend!",5,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"Very impressed by this product. I love how it instantly connects as soon as you remove it from the charging case. Great design. I would love it if the battery lasted longer but it's still good for about 2 or 3 hours. Depending if I'm on a phone call or just audio. I now have a new problem I face with wireless ear phones, where do I put the bud when I need to listen to someone talk? Hahahha I almost lost it once doing that.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"These are great because they are buds that come with a charging case that makes these easier to keep up with and keep charged without always having to plug them into an electrical socket!  They do fit easily in the ear, but I am not sure if they would stay with a lot of activity- I work out with them, but I don't jog with them or anything...I will say I am not wild about having them so deep inside my ear- that's new for me, but for something that fits inside the ear, it does fit well, and does block out the noise around me pretty well, as well as they can get LOUD and they are clear.  They look a little funny in the ear but I guess all of these things do. They can be linked to the Bluetooth together, or individually as 2 separate ear buds...  I did get them wet in the rain (the buds not the case) and had no issues with them to date.  All in all, pretty great set for wireless ear buds!!!",4,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0
"I only gave this product 4 stars for several reasons.  I used this set for phone calling all day long.  I found it cumbersome to end and start calls by pressing the side of the unit.  It fit well and provided several sized ear bud covers, however, it did not meet my needs for the reason I was using it.  I'm guessing if you use them during workouts or other situations where you leave them in and don't accept lots of calls during use - they may work better.  The SOUND WAS GREAT.  If used for music or video's - they would be a great set.",4,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0
"I have only used these once but so far they hold up to the other reviews. The charging case and earbuds feel quality. Although I wish the case was a little more compact. The plugs are soft and after some finagling I figured out how to get them to fit well. They do feel a little heavier in my ears than expected and I was afraid they would fall out easily. But they stayed in for my entire run without needing any adjusting. And they are pretty comfortable. I havent tested the battery life yet but the sound quality is reasonably good. I didn't really feel like they had great noise canceling qualities but then again compared to traditional noise canceling headphones, earbuds never do. Overall I am pleased with this purchase.",4,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0

"These have very good sound quality, and I like the convenience of wireless charging. The volume levels are good (I use these under ear muffs for mowing) and they stay connected 95% of the time.The only issues I've had have been the pairing of the Bluetooth; when using both earbuds, they do not automatically pair with my Galaxy S9 like everything else does - you have to pair them manually on the phone; and sometimes they even don't pair with each other out of the charger box - I have to put them both back in the case and pull them out together again. If I want to use just the right earbud, it won't pair with the phone because it is looking for the left earbud first and hangs there, requiring several iterations of ""back in the box"" and pairing again with the phone.",4,1,2019-8-17,1,0,0
"These things are great!  Lots of bass, fit good, and mine lasted over 3 hours and 50 minutes on one charge!  They can be turned up so loud that they will blow your eardrums out.  I like loud music, but I can’t turn them up more than a little over half way before they are busting my head open!  I read a lot of the other reviews and was kind of skeptical, but after trying these I would have paid more for them.  Other people were saying that they kept losing connection, but even after almost 4 hours on one charge they still sounded amazing and did not cut out even once.

Regardless, everyone is different of course and just be patient, you'll find the correct size. The quality is absolutely amazing and I just can't image how much better a set of expensive Apple Earpods are compared to these. All I know is, $39.99 is a sweet bargain. And, 33,000+ people have bought this. That should say a lot. I love them and will buy again if end up misplacing them.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0

Im not sure how this product got so many positive reviews.  The earbuds are comfortable and stays in your ear.  However the connection is glitchy. I returned mine cuz it was really bad and got a replacement. it was better but it continues to cut out when i move my head to certain positions.  The worst part is i have to manually go to my Bluetooth setting and connect...i have the iphone 8+...the battery life is total LOL,1,1,2019-6-2,1,1,0
"For starters I like that the case lid is opaque and you can see only the LED's through it.  It can also charge wirelessly which is just a bonus in my opinion.  These buds are simple and easy to use.  Once you pair them to your phone for the first time, you literally take them out of the case, they pair to each other and your phone automatically, and you put them in and start listening.  They are a pair of headphones that do exactly what they are supposed to do. One button on each side, that you can't even see, to answer a call/pause/play if needed.  Also a built in mic, which i admit i haven't used yet, but that doesn't make a difference to me.  I needed something for the gym so I didn't have a wire hanging to my phone, and these are perfect.  For the price, you can't do any better.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I'm not a big fan of the ""plug"" style ear buds.  I have always had trouble keeping them in my ears.  They offer 4 different sizes, and they do stay in, but ears start to hurt after extended use.  Splitting hairs at this point but I would love to see these with the little rubber hook that fits in your ear to hold them in a little better, similar to the Bose style.",4,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0

First of all 5 stars for the excellent customer service. My right earbud stopped working after a short while. The customer service at TOZO was immediate and very helpful with information to troubleshoot any problems and sent me a replacement once it was found faulty.The earbuds sound great and will last a few hours full volume.

"ORIGINAL: I was excited for these earbuds since most of the reviews were 4-5 stars, however my pair had a very loud static sound when playing music (to their credit they were perfectly silent when no music was playing). This sound persisted after resetting the earbuds (suggested as a static fix in the manual). I've owned cheaper earbuds which had no static, so I'm reasonably sure it isn't a problem with my device. Hopefully this was just a defective set and can either be fixed or replaced.EDIT: I returned my original pair for a replacement; While the static is less pronounced on the new pair, it is still more present than it was on cheaper pairs, so these aren't great for quiet music.",3,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0

They are sleek and the sound quality is superb. Waterproof is a plus. I can use these for listening to music, taking calls at work or mowing the lawn. Completely satisfied.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0
Glad I bought these instead of over paying on something else. Had them just over a week. Fit your ear with the assorted rubber ear piece sizes first bc I dropped one in the washing machine (still works great) and the second time one hit the concrete I sized my ear up and it stays in great. Bass - if 10 is unbearable these are a 8. Treble a 9... Both can be used for hands free talking so during business day I only use one at a time and swap to charge /give an ear a break about ever 4 hours.,5,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0
Love the ease of use of these ear buds. I’ve been using them for a few months now and love them.  I love How the case charges the ear buds up. You just charge the case and your good to go for a few days. I like How you can use both or just one. They sit very comfortably in the ear and sound great. I’m liking these a lot better than the ones you put around your neck. If you don’t want to carry the case with you and you have to take the ear bud out. It fits nicely in any pocket.,5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0

I love them, work great, decent distance from device, audio quality is a solid 8 out of 10, and connection pairing isn't quite as smooth as apple, but really works pretty well.  The only complaint I have is if you only want to use 1 it will beep for about 30 seconds signalling it is trying to find the other one, and if you don't ever connect them it will finally stop the beeping, I haven't found a way to get it to not do that.  but its a minor price to pay considering I usually use both ears, which connects super fast.",5,1,2019-5-13,1,0,0
"I bought these earbuds. After trying it out, I experienced a problem of the sound chronically cutting on and off while walking.  I thought it was defective so I returned the 1st one and got a replacement set. The replacement earbuds also has the same problem. The earbuds works fine when sitting down stationary but had problems while moving. I planned to use these while walking but if it does not work while walking it defeats the purpose. I saw that other customer's reported the same problem so I am afraid this problem is common with no resolution. With that said, I am going to return for a full refund and look at other similar products. I would NOT recommend this product if you use these while walking/running/moving",1,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"These earbuds would be great if they lasted longer, you only get 3 hours of battery life! The sound quality is good and they fit my ears good but they die so quickly. I ended up giving them to my 11 year old son and I bought a pair of Back Bay wireless earbuds and those are amazing! 10 hour battery life with nice bass and sound quality. These have potential but not with that poor battery life.",3,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
These things are awesome. There very easy to pair. Sound quality is great. They have a weight to them they feel good in you ears . charging case feels good in the hand like an much more expensive pair of btear bud.All in all im very happy with them. I had a pair of beats before and incant tell the difference between the two as far as sound quality goes.,5,1,2020-7-2,1,0,1
I already own a pair of Jabra Elite Active 65t true wireless earbuds but... I stupidly left them at home for a long trip abroad and ended up buying these on Amazon as cheap temporary replacements. Definitely no chance of them being more than that.Cons:,3,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0
"Decent earbuds,they connect easy, comfortable to wear, good sound. I have one major problem with them that has me considering returning them... At 30% battery charge, a nagging, persistent ""battery low, please charge"" voice comes on. 30%? Really? Seriously... It's really frustrating that 1/3 of the already questionable battery life (from a full charge, they only lasted about 3 hours before the warning started) is unusable because of the annoying voice. I'll let them go through a couple more charge cycles, but I'm leaning towards returning them. Maybe there is a way to turn the warning off? Really disappointing.",3,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"I'm really happy with these earbuds so far.  Great quality sound and very comfortable.  I am very picky when it comes to sound quality and I can honestly say that I am very satisfied with the sound that these earbuds produce.  Very fast and easy pairing with my phone.  Very fast charging.  I haven't had them for long,  but I have purposely tried getting the earbuds to fall off by jumping around and shaking my head, with no success, they are on there real good.  Amazing earbuds for an amazing price!!  I highly recommend!",5,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
"I purchased based on reviews of the high quality sound being as good or superior to AirPods. That is a stretch. By no means are they poor just not on same level. The recharging case is nice but need to make sure they are in just right or won’t charge.  I bought them to wear while doing yard work. I do find that they pop out rather easily even after using a smaller rubber thingy. Pairing requires manually clicking in settings every time which is actually kind of annoying. Overall though, a decent purchase. One impressive point is that they survived a round trip through the laundry.",3,1,2019-8-16,1,0,0
"I had gotten some Bluetooth earbuds at Walmart during Black Friday for my self and as presents for Christmas.  The sound quality was lacking and the product was disappointing overall, I quickly returned them.  I went to Amazon to find alternatives and found my self here.  I purchased these Tozo earbuds and was thrilled about my purchase.  These were in another world compared to the ones I had returned to Walmart, and I saved money.I want to start off saying I love the ""truly wireless"" features, you charge the carrying case every other day and it charges your earbuds when you aren't using them.  You Just remove the earbuds from the case and they turn on and are ready to use.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"I just got mine, and I’m trying to get them to fit my (evidently very small) ears, but nothing is working. I have the smallest ear caps on them already, and that’s not the problem I’m running into. No matter how I rotate them or how far I try to shove them into my ears, they still never fit snugly; I can fit the entire tip of my index finger between my cartilage and the main part of the earbud without trouble. In addition, even when I shove them uncomfortably deep in my ears to try to get them to fit snugly (which doesn’t work), it doesn’t last long, and they return to the same position, floating away from my ear. I haven’t moved from where I’m sitting, so for now, they’re staying, but as soon as I get up and start trying to actually do things, they will most definitely fall out.Sound-wise, they work really well, so far, at least. In fact, the size is the only complaint I have about them; I’d love them if they actually fit. Highly recommend for someone with average-sized ears, but if you have small ears, I’d suggest against these.",3,1,2020-7-13,1,0,1
"It's hard to go back to non-waterproof earbuds/cases after having used these. Not because I plan to go swimming, but when I'm sweating like a pig, I don't need to think about it. Wearing them while mowing a dry and dusty yard is not a problem because the dust won't affect them. Also, if they get dusty, I can wash them off without worrying about breaking them. All around fantastic. Wouldn't mind a better battery life.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"The good: These are classy and very portable. It's really nice not to have a wire or headset connection between the left and right sides. They are sleek looking and the design is very attractive.The bad: Wow the battery life is awful. I'm getting 2.5-3 hours of active listening. Not good for a long work day sitting in my office, or a long workout.",3,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"I’ve owned multiple sets of ear buds just to find the battery life was short, sound quality was just “ok” and after a while, they were uncomfortable. As soon as I used these for the first time, I was shocked at how awesome the sound quality was, how comfortable they are, especially for long periods of time, how well the noise was cancelled and how long the battery lasted. Already recommended these to my coworkers!",5,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
First time trying these and I'm very disappointed. U got the Soundpeats True Capsule ear buds and they were great. After they broke I took a chance on these because of the reviews. To start the feel is weird. They don't grip and I'm constantly adjusting to find the right sound.Controls aren't as simple as they were with my Soundpeats. Battery isn't as good ad those either.,1,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"I bought these buds Jan 26th and have used them most everyday. These buds do fit well and sound pretty good. They do keep a reasonably effective charge and they do cancel noise fairly well. My problem is, I listen to pod cast and youtube while I walk and while I ride a bike. It seems as though they have a difficult time maintaining reception. I thought it was my phone, but using an old earbud (soundpeat) I have noticed it to be much better quality for lesser price. I lost the right sound peat and can only use the left now. If the Tozo earbuds are being used and my phone sitr still while charging, I can do very little movement. vacum, wash, go up and down stairs. If I put my phone outside on our picnic table, I can't even pull weeds or paint fence. I would love to trade these for another pair of sounpeats. Also the reception for these is not good when speaking thru bluethtooth, I always get people saying (HUH) I don't understand what you are saying. Thre are better buds for lower price",2,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"I am a bit of a sound nut, having grown up in a family where music is paramount and a father who designed speakers and sound processors. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of sound that this product provides. I poured over previous reviews, paying attention to what was said about the sound quality and bass output. I finally decided to make the purchase and have yet to regret it. The quality is good, the bass is ok, but after downloading an equalizer app for my phone (as suggested by the company and other reviewers) the quality became sharper and the bass has a nice kick to it. I've enjoyed using these at the gym. They fit great in my ears as well, since I have smaller ear canals and have trouble keeping most buds in. These stay in whether I am running, talking, lifting, or just moving around in general. They have yet to hurt after prolonged wear too. Ive also been impressed with the case, as it charges the buds quickly and works with my Samsung wireless charging pads. Very happy with this purchase.",5,1,2019-6-29,1,0,0
"I had gotten some real cheap wireless (though not true wireless) headphones on here before that lasted forever. They are still going strong but due to heavy use and possible damage, they were becoming a little spotty, so I needed to replace them. These headphones, I'm pleased to say, are keeping up, so far, with my old fave pair!The cons I'll go after first and all are minor or personal preference. They do feel a bit weighty in my ears, even with different cushions. It can cause part of my outer ear to ache slightly but that is after lots of hours of use. The other thing is the pairing, since the Left has to connect to the Right and can sometimes mess up due to other things they are connected to (my phone and comp will sometimes push the Left earbud out of connection) so I just have change a setting every once in awhile.",5,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
"First of all the earbud seems to be a bit big. So when you have it in the ear it's like this awkward piece out of your ear. They also fit tight in the ear which after a while makes your ear hurt. Do me a favor and save some time and money by not buying this product and getting others. I decided to buy because of the rating and what everyone was saying, but it's all false. At last, you get what you pay for...right?",1,1,2019-5-6,1,2,0
"The sound is clean and super good. It comes with extra ear caps in different sizes for a much better fit. The pairing with my iPhone and iPad was smooth, at the first try.The box wireless charging feature is a great bonus.",5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"The earbuds sound good when they are working properly. One of the earbuds cuts out all the time, I've paired and repaired them, turned things off and back on, checked settings in my phone etc. all to no avail. I was going to send an email to the manufacturer, but I've been trying to find the contact information here on Amazon and had no luck. Maybe I just got a defective pair of earbuds, but leaving this review seems to be the only way I might be able to get the manufacturer's attention.",1,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
"I have relatively small ear-openings and these actually fit quite comfortably. They likely fit better in terms of seating more within the average person's ears, but so far I have run around with them and no problems!!! I'm not sure if they would fall out with swimming (they suggest in packaging that they can) but I don't swim so it's hard to comment. I am however really happy with the sound quality!!! I actually feel the noise cancelling is quite impressive for this price range, and the packaging is great and so slim. Love them :)",5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"These earbuds are great .  Pairing and connecting was easy little effort required.  Sound quality is great.  I work in a loud warehouse and the sound is outstanding.  I like the effortless recharging of the earbuds in their dock.  I can't believe wireless charging of the dock.  A great value.  I purchased these to see if my ears would tolerate them before spending $130 to $250 dollar earbuds.  I am sold, don't think I will purchase the higher priced ones.  Might buy more of these TOZOS earbuds.Customer Service is Outstanding.  Their concern is to make the customer experience the best one could ever expect.  I have never experience this level of friendly, patient, and fast customer service.",5,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones in February and I wanted good headphones for the gym that had decent bass. These are awesome; I use them for running, resistance training, or even at work. I can't speak to whether coworkers at the office can hear them when I listen loudly, but it hasn't been an issue. The bass is great and the highs are decent too for not being over-ear headphones. Ultimately I have loved them.I did have an issue in May where the left earbud wouldn't pair with the right, so while I could get sound playing out of each one individually, I wasn't able to use them in the same capacity. I tried for three days to fix it using the instructions but the earbud on the left wasn't lighting up purple as indicated in the directions so I had to contact the TOZO support email. They are sending me a pair of brand new ones for free, which is amazing. I am just glad to be able to have smaller earbuds again for when I go running.",4,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"Far too much static.  Not that comfortable to wear.  Would not buy again.  Customer service sent me a second set of earphones.  I hate to say this, but they were worse than the first set.  This set has no base.  Both sets do not provide a lot of volume.  I'll modify my review because they did try to help.  I think the second set was actually an older model than the first Tozo-T6 vs Tozo-T10-R.  Anyway, I still can't recommend them.  Sorry, Christine",2,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"The packaging and quality of these earbuds seems great. The case stays shut magnetically. The lid is black and you can see the lights inside representing the charge status of each earbud and the case itself. Charged very quickly. The sound quality was very good. The best sound quality of the 3 wireless earbuds I have bought so far (all similar price range) I would give the sound quality an honest 7.5/10 Crisp highs, clear mids, surprisingly well represented but still a bit muddy lows. I wasn't able to get the most sealed and comfortable fit with any of the provided tips.  Unfortunately I was lead to believe these were compatible with google assistant and that's kind of a selling point for me. I'll most likely return these for some that work with google assistant. If all you want is headphones for listening to music this is a great buy.",4,1,2019-6-17,1,0,0
"I like these earbuds just fine, they hang out of the ears, mine at least, a bit more than they are shown on the site, sometimes pairing is a pain, but by far the worst issue I have is battery life. I haven't had these very long, not even year, and the battery life is just about 2 hours. I know this because yesterday I was on a run, my run was 2 hours and 17 minutes, and the earbuds died 10 minutes before I was done. I was hoping to use these in my race in 3 weeks but I'll be running longer than that and these just won't cut it. I'd get something else if you're looking for battery life.",3,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"Purchased these earbuds for my daughter. I tested them out myself first. In my opinion the sound quality is excellent compared to the name brands that cost 4 times as much! The bluetooth connected without problems to my daughters iPhone as well as my Android. My daughter has never liked the ""fit"" of the earbuds that come standard with iPhones but says these are lightweight and comfortable in her ears. For the price , I won't have a heart attack if she loses them compared to the name brand ones.",5,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"I was initially disappointed with the headphones. Despite having actual buttons, on both earbuds, there is no volume control or playback control beyond pause and play for whatever is playing.With that, I proceeded to spend the entire evening after receiving these little guys trying to find the perfect pair of affordable headphones that ad all the features I wanted and proceeded to purchase a competitors device. When those headphones arrived I was disappointed by the mechanism that is used to engage the controls ( Jlab Jbuds AIr Sport), and what was really bothersome was the volume and sound quality. I literally canceled the return on these bad boys and returned the jlabs.",5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"No matter how much the battery is charged, or how close my phone is to the headphones, these headphones keep ""skipping"" audio because of issues with the Bluetooth connection. I tried all the steps to get it to improve, but nothing worked. Bought some jlab go airs and they do not have this problem. They're also lighter and stay in my ear better.EDIT:  After this was a 1-star review, the vendor sent me an ""updated"" version (the TOZO T6 item that is listed as the updated version of this T10).  The problems with Bluetooth Skipping and issues are gone, as far as I can tell.  The T6's fit better, are lighter, and the case is smaller, and more variations of ear-plugs with variable stiffness and sizes.  If you're looking at picking up these headphones, Get the T6.  They're much better.  I'd still give the T10's 1-star, but I'm changing this review to 4 stars based on both the support of TOZO, but the T10's are still **terrible**.",4,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"These provide a very good sound quality and easily connected to my iPhone.  The charging case provides on the go flexibility.  Provides multiple size ear pads.  My only issue (and its a big one) is that they are constantly falling out of my ears, even after going to the smallest size in the ear piece selection pack. This might be something most users will not have an issue with, but they just have not worked out for me.  I gave it 4 stars primarily because the product itself is very good and hopefully will work out for most users.",4,1,2019-7-8,1,0,0
"I've finally found ear pods that actually fit my ears!!! I've searched high and low for years trying to find ear pods that won't fall out of my ear while I'm walking but now I've found TOZO!! They came in a timely fashion and it came in attractive packaging. As soon as I opened the packing I was surprised at how nice the ear pods looked but what really got me was the sound quality! These little ear pods have very nice bass to them and the quality of sound allows you to hear little nuances in your music, that you ordinarily would not hear. Pairing your ear pods to my phone was effortless. You just have to make sure that you connect the (right earpod) first, which is the dominant ear pod and the left ear pod will automatically connect once the (right earpod) connects. Another nice feature is the charging case. Once you've paired your earpods and taken them out of the case, the earpods will automatically connect to your phone. When talking on the phone, the person could hear me clearly, which is another feature I look for in earpods. I have not had the earpods long enough to comment on how long the battery life is but if its anything like the other positive features of these earpods I'm sure I won't be disappointed. THANK YOU TOZO!! GREAT PRODUCT for a reasonable price!!!",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0

The only thing is at times the connection drops but it comes back and sometimes I am not sure if it’s the area or not but the person can’t hear me. So far I like them they are convenient and the charge definitely lasts for a good bit, much longer than me iPods. Love black do the color doesn’t bother me much.

Any my other noise cancelling over-the-ear headphones while providing good sound weren't suitable for running because they were soaking in all the sweat.I completely satisfied with the sound quality of my new TOZO earbuds. They don't provide complete isolation, which is good when you're running outside. As long as I found right size of cushions they sit comfortably tight in my ears. I didn't have any pairing issues.

If you like strong, solid bass, warm midrange, and crisp highs, these earbuds will not disappoint. I have a collection of wireless buds from different brands (Mpow, Anker, Soundpeats, Boltune) some with larger 10 to 12mm drivers, but IMO the TOZO T10s have better range, clarity, and bass impact.",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,1

"Could not be happier with this product volume level is much higher than most Bluetooth devices. Battery life is great, sound quality is great and bass level is also great for the price point.

I've owned other products that were similar to these, but for less than $10 more than I spent on those other earbuds, there is a BIG difference in quality with these made by Tozo. Here are some of the things that stand out about this model vs earbuds made by other companies I've tried:First of all, the build quality is fantastic. The charging case is sturdy, and the magnets which ""click"" the earbuds into place are very strong.

It would also connect to a random device that I did not own (or at least say it was connected to another device) so that would interfere with the device I wanted to listen to. When this would happen my music would go in and out. I haven't used this device heavily so I don't know why it would suddenly start having problems.Maybe I just got a lemon, but like I said, it was great when it was working correctly.

I would have to shutdown bluetooth, on my closed, sleeping mode computer before it would let me attach to my phone-very irritating. These were so effortless. I LOVE it.

I am blown away. The sound quality on these earbuds is beyond belief. For the price, you CANNOT GET BETTER. I am a musician and a DJ, and I know music. These are phenomenal. The bass is nothing short of intense. The mids are clear. The highs are crisp. Oh, and by the way, I'm writing this review in the shower. My Note 9 is waterproof too.

Battery life is decent, at work I only use one at a time and each one lasts about 4-5 hours so I have to switch from one to the other midway though my shift but that's fine by me. They were also super simple to pair, even my boomer dad could figure it out lol. The only cons I could come up with if I were nit-picking is that the charging case is microUSB and not type-C (though you can just use a wireless charger) , and if you cover the left earbud with your hand it can sometimes break the BT connection. Other than that they're perfect. 4.8/5 would recommend.",5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0

About 30min-1hour later, it lost it connection. I tried to reconnect and it didn't work. I read the 'troubleshooting' and it said to remove and reconnect to device.

Also, when I connect to my phone and listen to music, the sound would randomly stop for like a second and then come back.

They sound very bass heavy (like its electronically boosted) but doesn't distort the sound.  The treble sounds prominent enough and not harsh.  They have good detail and sound stage.The main problem with these for me is they start to slowly come out of my ears after a few minutes of putting them in my ears (especially the left side) they then lose bass, audio quality and outside sound dampening.  I know many people don't have this problem so I won't subtract stars for that.  If anyone else has that problem I've found that wearing a head band helps a lot to keep them in.",5,1,2019-2-14,1,0,0
"Reason for reducing 1 star is it has no volume control function on the ear buds. Now why is it important? It is coz u may not always have easy access to device it is connected to control volume.Otherwise, it's a great product, fits decently well, sounds great including bass is very good.",4,1,2019-7-12,1,0,0
"I use wireless headphones every day in the gym and while working in the yard, riding bike, walking and sometimes just doing housework.  I've got Bose, Samsung, JBird and several others.  I actually really love these and for the price I can have a few different pairs so that one is always charged.  The wireless charging capability is an even bigger plus.  We are buying these for Christmas Gifts this year.",5,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
I haven't had it very long but I have to say I like them so far. They are comfortable in my ears and stay in well (I had to return a different pair of earbuds because they made my ears hurt)I do wish that the battery life of the earbuds was longer. We'll see how much this effects my enjoyment of the product. I really like the case it comes in. I especially like that you can see when the earbuds are charged without opening the case.,5,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
"I really wanted to like these wireless earbud, if for no other reason, they were my first and they were waterproof.  After all, what would be cooler than being able to take a shower with earbuds on.However, I immediately noticed that they did not fit in my ears at all.  At first, I thought it was because the ear caps were too small but even after putting in larger ear caps and twisting the ear buds into ear canal, they still felt very unstable.  Even though they are not that large, the lack contour and the weight distribution just feels all wrong.",2,1,2019-9-7,1,0,0
"Background: I am by no means an audiophile or someone who has used expensive audio devices or has exceptionally high standards for quality. Despite that, these were bad enough for me to return, and I will explain why. In recent history I really just use whatever Powerbeats-style (connected by a wire, loop/hook that goes over top of ear) knockoff/budget pair I find, and most recently I was using the SENSO Bluetooth headphones. When those broke after much use, I found these and the style was a little different but I decided to give them a go. I will break down my experience in a few categories: fit, sound, bluetooth/design, battery life.Fit:",2,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0
"Everything was great until I took them outside for a walk. Had my Iphone XR in my pocket and the music kept going in and out..Took out of my pocket thinking too far from ear buds...nope...still same issue. They work inside the home with no issues...outside, maybe too much interference or something. But when it does work, I am very happy. Like rap and a lot of base and this has just enough crisp base for my liking. I would not recommend this since I can't use them outdoors.",3,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"I always have trouble keeping ear buds in my ear, it always feels like they slip out easily. I still have that problem, but I love that I don't have to wear it around my neck and have the cord in the way. Also, if I need to keep an ear open for my kids while I wear them, I can keep one tucked safely in the box and just use the main one. The sound is awesome, and they turn on and connect as soon as you place it in your ear. You can listen for a long time. I have yet to have one shut off due to low battery.",5,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
"So far I’m rating this product only by sound quality and it is amazing. I had trouble keeping the buds in my ears without them falling out but I have not figured out how to do it right yet. TOZO company, based in China, does not advertise themselves as sound engineering firm, which brings up a question of how this kind of professional hi-fi sound quality can be packaged into such low price product and where the sound engineering technology is coming from.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"I ordered this in June and had no problem setting up, charging and using.  It was very convenient and easy.  However, after about six weeks of use, the right ear bud would not pair with my phone.  I contacted TOZO and they quickly responded with a method to reset the earbuds.  I did as they instructed but the right bud still would no longer pair with my phone.  TOZO replied that this was a very unique situation and would replace both buds free of charge.  I was most impressed with the way the problem was handled and solved.",5,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"The packaging was very well done. The pairing is fast and easy. I have it for about a day and it never fell off during my movements, i mainy got this for exercise. The bass is like asmr to my ears. The quality of sound is clear and crisp. Charging is also very fast, and battery last over 3hrs something before you get notified that the battery is low. It magneticly snaps into the charging case so it's hassle free. I am totally happy with this product. It comes with a 1 year extended warranty too.",5,1,2019-10-18,1,0,1
Overall I love these. I got them in tan so they were less obvious if I wanted to wear them discreetly.The first time pairing was about as easy as it gets and they came charged so I didn't have to wait to try them.,5,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0
I have to say I was very surprised how light and comfortable these earbuds were. The sound quality was a lot more than I expected. The bass tones were rich and I could not hear any other noise around me. It is very convenient that there are multiple sizes for earpieces. my wife and I have different sized ears and it's convenient to interchange them between the larger ones and a smaller size. the wireless charging of the case was it unexpected surprise. This is definitely a good price for the value of earbuds that you get.,5,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
These are some of the best sounding earbuds for the price and I really like them over other brands that I have purchased.The earbuds charge has lasted several hrs with no charge and stay in place very well.,3,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
I had these wireless earbuds for about a week and I have been enjoying them. I like the sound quality and was easy to pair to my devices. The negatives are when using it on call at times the other person cannot hear me but on most calls they hear me clearly. It is however better than other wireless earbuds I had where the other party could not hear me at all. Another thing I noticed is when I use it with my tablet at times there is a slight delay with the audio when streaming shows. I love using them in the shower to listen to music and I don't have to worry about disturbing my family.  So far I like them and I look forward to seeing how they are over time.,4,1,2019-1-8,1,0,1
"I bought these back in July and used them for a bit and loved them right away. The sound is great and they stay put really well. This wouldn't normally be an issue, but I had jaw surgery recently and I cannot have anything in my ear canal anymore. I was so bummed about this but my husband was grateful because I had to give them to him. He uses them all the time and is very happy about it.",5,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0
"After a few days I'm impressed with these buds. Sound quality is surprisingly good for earbuds (though not good by any objective measure of sound quality, let's set that straight), and noise isolation on calls is acceptable. In noisy environments your first syllable will get dropped when you speak.The fit was good for me, but not for my wife, it's about the shape of the ear not the size, and the right one would fall out of her ear. For me, 40 minutes of vigorous walking did not dislodge them at all.",5,1,2019-9-1,1,0,0
"Excellent quality for the price of the product. I haven’t used the product long enough to determine battery life, however the product itself is great in terms of features and quality. The sound quality definitely impressed me for the price. It is pretty clear sounding in terms of music. Like regular earbuds, it is pretty noise cancelling, especially when using the right sized bud. There are different sized buds you can attach on the earpiece (S,M,L, & XL). I usually have an issue with earbuds falling out (especially the wired Apple ear buds). When placed snugly in the ear, they don’t seem to fall out. I use the smallest sized bud because I have really small ears. Overall, super impressed, easy to set up, and worth the price!I will say I was slightly skeptical given the large number of great reviews, but decided to order and I’m extremely impressed! I never have written an Amazon review before, but I would write another great review on this product if I could!",5,1,2020-10-2,1,0,1
"I first purchased them for my boyfriend whose extremely hard on everything or looses things.  First day he lost one in a field on a rainy day. It was hours before we were able to find it but he powered it up & it worked perfectly!! If they make it through him, they are tough! I then decide to get a pair myself & overall I really like the Tozo T10! I love the charging case, sound quality is wonderful, they fit well & stay in place. I’ve also had a few accidents with liquids but so far my earbuds have rebounded without any problems. My only complaint would be the battery life while listening to music. I did not realize your total listening time was only 3 hours, I’m a music lover & run out of battery throughout the day. My saving grace is having the charging case which makes it very easy to recharge & continue listening. Not once has my case battery run down throughout the day, it’s wonderful!! I love they way the magnets grab the earbuds into place in the charging case!! I would totally recommend them to anyone, especially anyone whose rough on things, they are tough!!!",4,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"I really enjoy these, surprisingly. I think my only complaint would be getting them to pair together. I generally just have the right one in, which is supposed to be master, and use both occasionally. But pulling left one out of the case just transfers all my audio to my left. I've fiddled with them in multiple ways to figure out how to get them to pair simultaneously, and the only thing I've found so far was to put them both in the case and pull them out together. Kind of a pain. This all could be operator error, however.All that aside, great product.",4,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0

"Ok. So I just got these but, I bought mine because I loved my daughter's pair.  They arrived already charged and easy to use with my phone.  The sound is Amazing. I didn't have to turn the volume up very far to block the sound of the tv.  My daughter tried talking to me while I was wearing them, turned off, and she was very muffled. I would say these are really great earbuds. I am going to buy another set for my husband.",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,1
"I'll start off by saying that customer service is great, they reply back fast and assist you with any problems that arise.These TOZO T10 earbuds are well worth the money. They are a great affordable option for people that don't want to overspend on name-brand expensive earbuds, as they work just as well! The bluetooth pairing was simple and effortless. I love the sound, its crystal clear and has a nice base and volume. The case is sturdy and well built, not to mention super cute! The only drawback is a personal problem, I have pretty small ears so I had to put on the smallest earbud size. But all in all, these are great for working out as they are waterproof so sweat won't damage them. I'd recommend this to anyone that wants expensive sounding earbuds for cheaper! Thank you TOZO!",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"(full disclosure: I was given a newer and better product to review and have changed my review based on that product) The T10 earbuds were still okay. The physical button was a hassle and the case is large. I was sent the T6 and was allowed to keep the T10, if I agreed to review the T6. The T6 is a much better earphone and addressed every issue that I had with the T10. The T6 is full touch, way smaller, and retains the wireless case charging. I recommend the T6",5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"I'm very pleased that the treble for these earbuds comes through so clean and these aren't bass boosters like most devices.  I use them inside of over-the-ear noise protection when cutting the lawn and solo when cycling.  I can still hear surrounding traffic, bit more as background ambient noise.I did have one earbud come out while riding once (very sweaty by that point) and it rolled into a storm drain structure.  Sat in water for 5-minutes while I pried the lid up and worked just great ever since.  Very please with these.",5,1,2019-6-17,1,0,0
"These have very nice sound quality and are easy to use, however, I am having a hard time getting them to fit in my ears, even having changed the ear pieces.  Maybe I just have weird ears. My daughter tried them and she felt that they stayed in her ears very well, that when she shook her head back and forth, she didn't think they would fall out.  But she only had them in for maybe 20 seconds or so.  I like the taupe color, but I don't like the bulkiness of them.  However, these are a good value, I feel, for all I need them for.",4,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"During this stay at home period, I started to focus on my daily walking routine and thought this ear bud is going to be my companion.  Unfortunately when listening to music the music periodically stops and distorts and when listening to podcast this was really annoying.  Also at times when I wanted to take the call while outside, the other person could barely hear me.  I thought may be my phone provider signal was a problem and so I connected to my wifi while inside home and tried it and still the same result.  I am completely not sure what is going on with this piece.  I bought this with over 90K review all totalling 4.5 stars and I loved all the comments but very disappointed that I am not able to use this device effectively and now it is sitting in my office corner waiting for me to pick it up..  nope, I am using my over the ear beats wireless which is doing an amazing job on all those I mentioned earlier..",2,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0

"I've been using these earbuds for a few days now and I absolutely love them! I spent hours researching true wireless earbuds. When I came across these, I liked that they were waterproof and noise canceling  - as I mainly use them for the gym. I've had some pretty sweaty workouts with them and they stay in. The sound is awesome too, and this is coming from a previous Beats user (when Beats were good). I've told family and friends to invest in these as well.They come with a 1 year warranty - another plus!

After going through two pair of the wireless earphones, I decided I wanted a pair of wireless ear buds for working out on my elliptical a machine.  I sweat a lot so I wanted a set that was sweat proof but I wanted a pair that had very good audio quality and long battery life.  These TOZO T10 wireless ear buds were the perfect replacement.  They have fantastic audio (excellent sound across the entire range), they are sweat proof, and have excellent battery life.  They were easy to pair to my phone.  A bonus for me was that the case also can be charged wirelessly. Couldn’t have found a better pair of wireless ear buds.",5,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
"This was probably the easiest set up I've had. Connection was immediate. Ease of use was a 10. The sound quality is really good for the $! I thought I was taking a chance, but this panned out. The earpieces can be switched for a snug fit; I cannot use Apple products as they fall out no matter what. I thought I would always have to use a version with a clip. This is awesome. I'll check back after a month of use, but this looks good!",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"****Update. The left earbud has stopped working. It won't pair with the right earbud and the voice prompts are slowed? It's weird. Anyway disappointing as these weren't ""that"" cheap. They should last longer. I hope there is a warranty....I really love these. I bought them so I could listen to podcasts in the shower and not bug everyone with a shower radio.  Sound quality is great. No connection issues whatsoever. The only and I mean only flaw really is that wearing them in the shower....as soon as you get a little water in your ear area, they loose grip and start to come out. I wish someone would come out with some earbud tips that have rubber that has some grip/texture on it so they don't want to move.",1,1,2019-1-10,1,1,0
Okay so the reason why I give this four out of five is because sometimes audio goes in and out when you jog or even just standing around. I don't like the fact every time the battery gets low the Stars to do this constantly. I'm actually thinking about returning them if the problem gets worse. Besides that when playing music it works flawlessly and when on the phone the people can hear me clearly. If they just fix the sound cutting in and out it would be perfect.,4,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
Earbuds: They sound great. I LOVE THE BASS. If you search a a battle scene on youtube and put these headphones in...it feels like your in the movie theater. The bass is good an deep. I love them. I don't have any issues with them connecting to my phone. The treble is a little weak but I think a quick adjustment in your phones settings will do the trick. The volume is also plenty loud. I never but them up all the way.Mic: I have no issues with the mic quality at home or in my car. The volume also gets plenty loud as well. Even on the highway the mic dosnt seem to pick up a ton of background noise. You can use one or both earbuds! This was huge deal for me! Alot of these other earbuds will only do one ear and dont get loud enough.,5,1,2019-5-14,1,0,1
I bought this product five months ago. It started with only 4 hours of battery life and now it’s only 3hours.Also I can’t use it when talking on my phone because the other person gets horrible feed back.,1,1,2020-9-30,1,1,0

"These work very well and the battery will last about 3 hours on a charge.  They are a little large, but I find them comfortable enough. I’m not sure they would stay in place during activities although for my use they are fine.  The holder is also a charger and it seems like I can get 1 or maybe 2 charges before it needs to be plugged in again. They turn on when you remove them from the box and connect automatically to each other and your device. They can be used on multiple devices once you have them paired.

Durable so far, if it falls on the floor, and because of the magnets if picks up all kinds of grinding dust lol.. I wipe it off stuff It back in my ear and works fine.

Highly recommendedEdit 06/19/2020: Had to take my rating down to 4 stars because I came to the realization that the battery life is terrible. They need to be charged every 3 hours or so (a voice comes on telling you to). That's pretty bad compared to a lot of the other options out there.

"I was looking for earbuds that I could listen to my music at work and have the ability to watch tv without volume being an issue.  I had been on the hunt for awhile when I came across TOZO.  I needed something that was going to stay in my ears, have good sound, good range, ability to connect to different types of devices and be at a reasonable price.  After reading the description I delved into the reviews with my focus being on the negative. I have to know what the primary complaints are to see if they are deal breakers.  The only reasonable complaint were the few connectivity issues.  This group is very small into comparison of the reviews and was a risk I was willing to take.I had no issues with the packaging, which everything was secure and how I expected it to be. I was able to connect to each device that I planned on using it for without incident.  The sound quality is shockingly good and all outside sounds are virtually cancelled out. Huge plus!  The case is solid and buds drop in smoothly for charging.  I did wait a couple days to write a review as I wanted to wear these for an extended time to see how my ears felt after wearing them for a few hour and walking around and away from the device it was connected to.  I did not have any aching in my ears from pressure or weight and I did not lose connection.",5,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"My husband and I love these earbuds. Sound quality is great, as well as how loud these little buds are, they cut off at times but really good earbuds for the price. We do night Patrol we receive calls, as well as call each other, and listen to music while on property so our car speakers don’t be blowing up tenants sleep. We can’t afford to be getting tickets for talking on the phone so these came in clutch especially for the price.We both have our problems with the earbuds. My issue is that my right earbud works but my left one doesn’t, same goes for when I charge them right one charges left one doesn’t as well as the the earbud cutting off constantly.",4,1,2020-9-9,1,0,1

I wear them at work where I'm constantly moving, turning my head and bending over. They stay in my ears. There is little sound leakage even with the volume all the way up ( which isn't needed as the sound is strong).I read reviews that they lasted a few hrs, I had mine last at least 4 hrs before I took them out for a break, so I'm not sure how long they totally last yet. I would recommend this pair of earbuds.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0

Personally, I really enjoy that it's waterproof, as I can listen to music while I shower without any fear of my earbuds being damaged. I work in a warehouse, and sometimes do monotonous tasks where I can just take one out and listen to some music, even if I'm working in wet conditions. The charging case is lightweight and easy to carry around in my pocket, and the earbuds themselves stay in my ears with no trouble at all. It's also great for talking on the phone, and I've asked multiple people about the sound quality. So far, there have been no complaints.

"Love these little suckers! The sound really is in both pods making music so much better to listen to. Battery life is great too; I use mine for about an hour or two a day and only have to charge every five-six days. They stay in ear pretty well, but little ""wings"" on around the edges might help keep them in-ear better. This could also be because I have smaller ears and the pods don't sit all the way in - which is probably also why noise cancelling isn't so great for me. Minor inconveniences for the sound quality and battery life though.",5,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0

"Seemed like a great purchase at first but now (about 5 days after receiving them) , it has become apparent that it is a really bad product. The battery life is somewhat short. But the main issue is connectivity. Even on the first day, they disconnected at random, and this continued. And now, just a few days after opening them, the left won’t pair to the right. I have tried restarting them several times to no avail, and putting them in the case and taking them out, but no luck either. I am waiting on a response from the support team but from what it seems, this product is cheaply made and not worth the buy.Update: The team got back to me and the initial connectivity problem was solved. However, today, the right earbud fell out of my ear onto the floor and now does not work at all. From my ear. If these are meant for exercise and have no strap to stay in your ear, not designing them to survive a fall from ear height is absolutely ridiculous and such poor quality. Still one star.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"The ear buds and the charging case they come in are great and customer service was the best experience I've ever had. They even emailed ME to make sure everything was up to par, which it was. The bass sounds awesome and the highs are crisp and possibly a little sharp but not enough to take away from the listener's experience. The waterproof rating is awesome so I can even listen to them in the shower if I wanted to. You won't find many with that high of a rating. Also, the charging case has the same waterproof rating of ipx8(just a little sidenote). They do have a nice Bluetooth range of 10 meters or about 36 feet and even at that distance it's still got a decent connection; any further and they will cut out too much. I found it interesting that when I was using the left earbud and had my phone with me, but the right earbud(the master earbud) was left in my room, the left would cut out until I was near the right one again even if I left my phone on the back porch. So the right earbud is the one that holds the connection, but you can still use each one individually, and the connection will be fine. I purchased the 3 year extended warranty without knowing the product comes with a 1 year extended warranty that is super easy to sign up for; just scan the QR code that comes in the package, which takes you to the website, enter in your amazon order number and that's basically it. They not only emailed me to make sure I was happy with their product, but they offered me a COMPLETELY FREE, no strings attached (no pun intended)wireless charger! That goes BEYOND customer service in my opinion. I'm glad I didn't order one beforehand(which I seriously contemplated). All in all they are a great sounding, comfortable set of waterproof earbuds with an excellent battery life, and the charging case doubles as a power bank to charge your phone. The 1 year extended warranty included is decent, and customer service is alone worth well more than the money you spend on this item, especially since they offered me the completely free wireless charger to make sure I'm happy. If you're interested in purchasing, just seal the deal. You WILL be happy.",5,1,2019-5-21,1,0,0
"I had two pair of the style 10, one pair sucked. Then the second pair started to act up.The company replaced one pair as a courtesy. They sent style 6 for free. Replacement went smooth company is great to work with, just wish your product was better quality as in connectivity and durability.",1,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"I wear hearing aids for hearing loss I sustained while I was in the Marine Corps, so I am very particular about the audio products I use. I swim for exercise, and I like to listen to Audible, so waterproof Bluetooth headphones are a must for me. I've tried several types of headphones and have had varied success. The last produce, which was similar to Tozo's T10, however, that set of headphones kept cutting off when the water touched it. Tozo's T10 has not had that problem. Signal strength, sounds, and ear seal has been great.",5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"Thought I'd give these a try since they are the most popular earbuds on Amazon.  I think they have good sound quality - not professional of course but for most every day use, it is good.  They fit great in my ears and I like the simplicity of wireless charging, pairing, etc.  HOWEVER, the left earbud does in fact drop signal or cut out if you're doing any activity such as walking around, exercising, or just being outside.  This was my immediate experience after trying these out.  I'll probably keep them because I'm only using them in bed at night, but for anyone else, you might want to consider this.",3,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"I've had these for a couple months and even though I had some issues with them staying in my ears - especially if I was working out, talking or eating - I generally enjoyed them. Sound quality is good. Battery life is ok. But just recently I've started having pairing issues, in that they were constantly trying to pair with my phone. I've had a difficult time charging them because even in the case they are paired to my phone. I've been using other bluetooth devices, then when a call would come in it would answer with these earbuds that I wasn't even using. It's really frustrating and I've tried cleaning the case and buds thinking that would resolve it but I'm still having issues. I know the description of the product said these are super easy to pair, this is just inconvenient. As much as I've enjoyed using them I think I'm going to let the battery die out and then just buy a different pair.",3,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"I've had these earbuds for a couple months now, so I figured I'd leave a quick review.  Ultimately, I'm pretty satisfied with these!I primarily use them when I'm in the gym.  The reason I actually looked for and bought these earbuds was because my last pair of Sony bluetooth headphones began to crap out after a while (partly, due to sweat), so I needed a quick replacement for working out.  So far, so good!  I don't take them swimming or anything, but they definitely seem to hold up pretty well during vigorous exercise on the treadmill and in the weight room.",4,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"A solid pair to tide me over while I saved up for AirPods. Okay battery life with great noise cancellation if you choose the right-sized bud cups. Sound quality is fairly good if you aren’t a musician or an audiophile, but the low ranges are boosted quite a bit, making everything very bass-y, even moreso than, say, a pair of Beats, and you just don’t the same crispy-clear sound you would with AirPods or other more expensive Bluetooth earbuds.Earbuds also occasionally have a tendency to switch between right and left channels, and then recenter, especially during calls (these earbuds prove to be very technologically inadequate at performing calls). This can be annoying at times, but you get used to it.",4,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
Several reviews listed these as being good for people with small ear canals. I guess I have really really small ear canals because they still are too big.  But I have to say this company has excellent customer service and worked with me to make sure I was totally satisfied.  Give them a try.,5,1,2020-5-17,1,1,0
"For the few days that I used it, the product itself was good with a few instances of fading out of range from the blutooth connections just by crouching. The battery life was about consistently 5 hours at full charges but the case itself could fully charge them a few times which is nice. When I would pair them, It would need to pair with the right one only and both would play if they were out. If I were to put the right one in the case, the left one would stop playing.  Suddenly the right one wouldn't work anymore, no sound, no charge, no ability to turn on. I found out the charging connection on the right earbud itself is damaged. Now I have to connect blutooth to the left one and the right one doesn't work. It lasted just over the warranty which was 2 weeks.",1,1,2020-7-17,1,0,1
"I bought the T10 Earbuds before traveling via air, so had an opportunity to really put them to the test. They are very solid-built from the earbuds to the case and charging port (see photos). The charging port is very well-designed with a protective cover to keep it clean. The sound is excellent with a solid and comfortable base. They come with several choices of comfortable quality plugs to find the best fit. They paired well with my Samsung Galaxy S10 mobile phone and have very effective noise-canceling, which was noticeable while flying with the heavy background noise. Tozo never disappoints and these are a solid choice.",5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,1
"I have had a few pairs of wireless earbuds before. A lot of times when working out, they would always seem to fall out due to the sweat or me moving around. With this set, its been different. They have really held up to my standard of working out and them not falling out. I think the only issue i have with these is that the battery life is somewhat weak but they do last a while and also the earbuds are sometimes hard to push the button on them when in your ear. But overall very happy with them.",4,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"I’ve only had these for a little bit but I am so amazed with these. I wanted air pods and now I am so glad I got these instead. The sound is amazing, and after paired they connect automatically when you take them out of the case. Phone calls sound great on both ends and the range is great so you can share with a friend easily. The only cons that I’ve found is that you can’t skip songs from them (on an iPhone at least) only pause, and if you click the button twice it redials? Which is strange to me I feel like that should skip songs instead. And the voice that tells you the device is on or connected is very obnoxious and loud and interrupting, I wish it was just like a tone.",5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"The pricing is completely irrelevant to the quality of this product. It can be left in 1 meter deep water for 30 minutes, the sound quality is the best ive ever personally experienced, and the battery life is so extra its almost pointless. When you take them out of the case to immediately put it on, the headset pairing voice is very quick and low so it would never hurt your ears. These could be 1-200+ dollars and id believe it, but for $50 its a steal, I was ultra hesitant but as a fellow human ill tell you, you've found the product.",5,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"After trying several different true wireless ear buds (and some not so wireless), I have finally found the perfect pair.I workout a ton doing functional training and needed to be free of cords.  I would constantly get the cord tangled and ripped out of my ear mid workout.  OR they would just fall out if I didn’t constantly keep readjusting them. I’m looking at you AirPods!",5,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0
"I have had these earbuds since June, and every time I go to use them, they’re dead.  When I prepare and MAKE SURE to charge them before a trip or workout, they’re great.  Excellent sound, 2-3 hours of play time, they stay in my ears (no small feat), and are very comfortable.  But I also have Anker SoundCore wireless earbuds, and while they don’t perform as well (fall out of my ears now and then, sound is good but not great), I can charge the case, put in my earbuds and they’re always fully charged, even after weeks in my backpack.  The Tozo ones are always dead (and yes, I seated them properly in the charging case and followed all of the direction ... to the letter!).  Five stars if they can fix the battery life / charging problem.",3,1,2019-8-16,1,0,0
"Note: This was a gift for my son-in-law and he loves them! Here's what he says:""There are so many different earbuds out on the market right now it was really difficult to decide on one I wanted. However, Amazon reviews are one of the biggest factors I look at when purchasing something and the reviews weren't wrong about this! The battery life is long lasting and the range is good. I don't use them for swimming so I don't know about the waterproofing but they fit great and the sound is clear and crisp. I love that they connect right away to each other and my phone. I also really like that the case can be charged wirelessly! I also use these for making calls and so far, everyone I've talked to has been able to hear me just fine. The only issue I've found is that they can randomly disconnect but they promptly reconnect after. I'm not sure why they do that but it doesn't happen often enough for me to care. I think that for the price these are the best value you will find and highly recommend the purchase!""",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I bought the Tozo T10 as a replacement for a pair of ear buds that lasted six months. I unpackaged the Tozo T10’s, fully charged them and started the pairing process. Let me tell you, I was amazed at how easy it was to pair these ear buds to my phone. Once paired, I selected my favorite music station and enjoyed a full 2.5 hours of music before having to pack up and attend a meeting at the office. When I put them away to recharge, I had no indication that power was low, so I believe I could  have gotten at least another 2 or more hours on the charge.Now, I’m no audiophile but I personally thought the sound these ear buds produced was fantastic!",5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"I liked how the setup for these earbuds took almost no time and I can quickly switch between my macbook and iphone if I want to use it for either. The voiceover when it connects is nice because it tells you that you have a call and such. The earbuds came with 4 different sizes which was very useful since my ears couldn't fit the original size, swapping out to the large was necessary and it's a perfect fit! I like most how I don't have to play them loud at all, I keep them at the first 2 digits on the volume and this is because of how well it cancels other noise. Overall, I'm currently enjoying these earbuds and will continue using them for as long as possible! It's nice that they are waterproof and they are pretty durable. The case is also a nice shape, you can even hang it from a keychain or something using the lanyard, but it fits in my relatively large pockets well.",5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"I have had the earbuds for about 3 weeks now, and they are great. Good sounds, clarity, and even works well to talk on the phone! I was down b  by the lake and one of the earbuds fell in about 3' of water. I was lucky to be able to find it after about 2-3 minutes and reached into the water and retrieved it. I thought I had probably ruined it. I shook it off let it dry  for a few hours, put it in the charging case and then tried a could of hours later. Powered up just fine, and is still working today. I am truly impressed with these earbuids, especially for the price.",5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0
"Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase. First I bought a more expensive product that arrived broken and I was super upset, but then I saw these and the ratings were so good and the price stood out to me, as well, that I thought I'd give them a try.They were so easy to set up and the noise cancelation is amazing. I have to watch out that I don't miss important alarms or something while I have these in! The sound quality is so good, too. I was worried that these were not as cute as the more expensive ones I had returned, but the ergonomic design makes up for it because they are so comfortable and definitely don't fall out!",5,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
"I bought these to wear on my motorcycle, the price isn’t outrageous and I figure if I lost one it wouldn’t be so bad. To make sure they fit and stayed put I tried them while mowing the lawn first (NOTHING will stay in my ears it usually hurts or just doesn’t even go in) these fit perfectly, didn’t budge the whole time and worked so well I couldn’t even tell if my blades were engaged I had to take them out to make sure it was running!Well I only wear one bud when I’m riding my motorcycle so I can hear road noises. I lost it. Because I still had the other ear bud I contacted the company and asked if I could purchase a single earbud, I’m very happy with them I just needed to wear a head band overtop so I don’t lose them! The company sent me a new right earbud as well as some mini caps so hopefully the fit will be better this was sent FREE OF CHARGE! I was not expecting to get it free it wasn’t their fault it fell out! Just buy these they’re awesome and they’re backed by an awesome company!",5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"Let me start by saying you will not be disappointed. These headphones fit very well, music sounds superb, not very bulky, the headphones and the case are magnetic which is a big plus. They do not feel cheap and also comes with a variety of sizes for the earbuds. I didn’t have to change mine, the medium fits perfectly.When it come to pairing, these are the fastest and easiest headphones I’ve had when connecting to my phone. It was practically automatic. When it comes to playing music, the settings are easy to remember and not difficult to control. Great sound but you can still hear if someone is trying to get your attention. I bought these when they Amazon had them as a lightening deal. I’m so glad I bought them. $25 is a steal!! Buy then if you are looking for something affordable and great quality. WAY cheaper than the AirPods I was looking at.",5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,1
"Very solid earbud case. The sound and fit of the earbuds are great! My only dislike is that there's no way to skip to the next song (that I know of) without using your phone. Other earbuds usually have a double click to switch songs, but these earbuds call your last contact when you double click.Not a deal breaker for me, but I would personally prioritize song switching over redialing.",2,1,2019-3-2,1,0,0
"If you're looking for inexpensive in ear buds, these are a good buy. Very easy to pair. Easy to charge. Look good. Decent sound quality. If you lose or destroy them somehow, your not out alot of cash. Come with a good assortment of rubber tips to fit most any size ear canal. Recharge time is fairly fast. Nice for the gym, or yard work. No wires. I use them for late night patio time, so I'm not bothering anyone.",5,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"I wanted to try a wireless headset but I didn’t want to spend so much on an Apple product. Ofcourse I search here first to find alternatives. After carefully reviewing comments about several products, I settled for this T10. I like the fact that it will allow me to use it for several hours more than AirPods, it’s black and it’s easy to use. Sound quality is great, noise cancelling is great, and fits nicely on me. This is definitely an amazing product!",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
So I bought these earbuds because apple iPods just don’t stay in my ears. I seen these and it was a good price so I took the chance and got some. Once I received them I tried them on and they were super comfortable and cause so pain or discomfort. The sound quality is awesome and love the noise canceling feature. I did have a issues a few months later after I use them everyday. I contacted TOZO and they were able to provide some tips to help fix my (R) earbud which wasn’t working. Those tips unfortunately didn’t work. So with no luck with the tips TOZO is sending me a new earbud. I would like to say that their response was quick and I can’t be any happier with them. I have recommended these earbuds to a couple people at work who know have them. Thank you TOZO (May@TOZO) customer service for your quick and helpful service.,5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"These are absolutely amazing! Sound quality is great, the 4 different size options available ensure a perfect fit in your ear, & they are so super comfortable, I honestly forget if I have them in. I love the chargeable case. I simply charge the case through the night while I sleep, although it doesn't take long at all to get a full charge on the case, maybe an hour or two. Honestly don't know for sure, cause I've never had them die on me. I simply take the case off the charger in the morning, then wear one at a time throughout the day. When one earbud dies, I swap it out for the other, then well before that one gets the chance to run down its charge, the other one is charged & ready to go. You can honestly do that throughout the entire day, & still have charge left in the case before ever needing to charge the case. They are the best!! I've purchased so many that were great (some just ok) at first, but then quickly just quit working all together without any explanation why. I've had these a month already & have no complaints. Will update if anything changes. Pairing up with your phone or device is very easy also. It's labeled either R (right or both) or L (left only), & is so easy to pair or unpair, while swapping back & forth between the two throughout a day's use. I haven't found that the sound is any different when only using one earbud, like can be the case with other earbuds/headphones. I don't miss any sound/dialogue/background noise/music when only one earbud is in use, it's the same as if I were using both. There isn't a way to adjust the volume on the earbuds themselves, you have to use your phone/device. However, unlike previous earbuds I've purchased that started out with the volume level way too soft/quiet needing adjustment, these are perfect with a wide range in volume level. I suggest these to everyone who asks about them. Plus the company, tozo, is great with an extended warranty available & other amazing product offers. Like I said, hopefully the last pair I need to buy",5,1,2019-5-22,1,0,0
"They look great, feel solid, are comfortable and block out noise perfectly. Pairing is not as easy as the T6, but paired well with my Galaxy phone. I also tried it on my Ipad with similar results. The sound was great, and I walked around my house with the phone in the bedroom to test out the range. I had no drops or signal loss, and I was beyond the 35-foot limit. The default ear plugs fit me fine, but not my wife. Fortunately, there are extra sets of plugs for different-sized ear canals. She's perfect now.",5,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
"I am really pleased with the sound quality, fit and comfort of these earbuds.  I had been thinking about getting some AirPods but I’m really glad that I tried these instead, because I am totally satisfied with Tozo’s earbuds. I can tell that a lot of thought went into their design. The only thing that I might change is ordering a different color because they are easier to see if you drop one.  I have been so happy with these that I went ahead and ordered some Tozo T6 earbuds, and they’re fantastic too. Give them a try!",5,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"I live in another country and I bought this item. Within a day of purchase the Primary  right earbud Stopped connecting. I reset it several times, it still refused to connect. I contacted customer support, who told me that the only way I can get a new one is if I returned it. I explained to them that the cost of shipping back to the US is more than the cost of the ear buds. He basically said there is nothing else he can do but provide me with the manufacturer information.I emailed the manufacturer and they responded a day after, they were courteous and kind, and within a week I had A replacement For the defective bud without returning the old one.",4,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
"Everything is great except for a misunderstanding and a technical problem. The misunderstanding that I saw was the fact that the earbuds themselves have a microphone. This, however, is not the case. I tested it by connecting them to both my computer and my phone and going into a different room. The people I was in a call with all said they could not hear me in the other room and that my audio sounded the exact same when using the earbuds.The technical issue is the fact that anytime I'm using these suckers on my phone, only one of them works. Both of them work on my computer, it's just my phone. YouTube, YouTube Music, iTunes, everything. Except for calls. I've had them work on both video and audio calls. But everything else has only one of them working. And I can switch between whether the left or right one works, I just can't get them to work together.",3,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"I bought this item the end of March and have used it maybe a handful of times. After maybe the third time the left ear buds stop syncing, now it won't power up.

I love these earbuds because of the noise cancellation and quality of sound so I am thrilled that I don't have to buy another pair.UPDATE: My second pair was sent out to me by the company and now it is October and again the new pair stopped syncing. I would not recommend to others and I won't buy again!!!!!!!!!",1,1,2019-4-28,1,0,0
Great wireless headphones from someone who has tried many! The sound quality is excellent for an earbud type headphone. The case charges them but is clear about how many charges it has left. The wireless charging for the case is super convenient. Headphones are lower profile and do not stand out too much while being worn. BEST FEATURE: when you take them out of the case they automatically turn on and when you put them back they turn off and charge. SO INTUITIVE!,5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,1
"Headphones are great for the price, and a good alternative so it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for good sound quality. One of them abruptly stopped working about 3 weeks after I got it.

No issues and you won't be sorry for buying!",5,1,2020-9-30,1,1,0
"I use these to listen to my music or podcasts while I do yard work.

"This is a very well designed product. The portable charging case charges wirelessly and holds enough juice to recharge the earbuds several times. I never find myself without a charge. Sound I good, with good base, particularly for the price point.

"I was a little skeptical that these were really noise cancellation headphones, but I was on a flight and tried them out and I was happy that it did cancel a LOT of the noise on the airplane.  I did have to insert them tightly and twist them towards the back of my ear to get a good seal.  Super happy with this purchase as they don't take up too much room.  The only downside is that the charged battery only lasts about 4 hours and I had to recharge them.  It does not take very long to recharge though.",5,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
"They aren't bad... Not as great as I thought, but worth the price.For sound: The sound is nice and clear when listening to music or phone calls, but I get a very subtle static-like clicking noise from mine when I'm closing an app, or pressing a button (it's not the sound effect from the phone, because I hear both the phone's sound effects and the clicks). It annoyed me because I heard nothing but praise, but I got over it.",4,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0

The sound quality was okay and they were fine for what it was.  A couple days ago one of the plastic ear hooks broke at the base of it and I took it back to Best Buy who told me it was still under warranty but that I would have to take it to an Apple store because they deal with the warranty stuff.I took it to the Apple store and they said that it was ""physical"" damage and that they couldnt replace it or give me credit for it.",5,1,2019-9-12,1,0,0
I mainly bought this so I can listen to podcasts and music while working. The earbuds work as intended. When you take them out of the case they turn on. You can use the left or right separately or they can link together. If you do intend to use them separately make sure you pair both of them and not just the right. They also turn off as soon as you put them back into the case. The case also holds a pretty good charge so I don’t worry about the earbuds dying.The only downside is that the left earbuds keeps falling out of my ear. So I probably need to switch to a smaller rubber piece or it could be a problem with my ear.,5,1,2019-4-25,1,0,0

"I have no clue how these got such great reviews!  The sound quality is so poor!  Tinny, scratchy, like you’re listening through a tin can at the end of string.  I got these to replace my old Apple EarPods, which have begun to fade after 4 years, but even they sound significantly better. I tested every ear-bud option that came with these headphones, and none made them sound better. I like a lot of bass, but find these are all bass and no tone.

"I've had my TOZO earbuds for about 3 weeks now and I love them. When I got them, I had to change the earbud shells (which are included) because my ear canals are small, but once I did I have never had any trouble with them falling out or feeling uncomfortable. The first time I put them in and connected them to my phone and started music, I was AMAZED at the quality of the sound, particularly the bases. I've never had any other earbuds or headphones that match the quality of sound, the comfort, the battery life, or the ease of use as the TOZO earbuds.I was somewhat cautious when I was considering buying them because of some reviews that state that when they use them at the gym, the connection fails repeatedly. I only use mine at the gym and I've never had this happen. The signal strength seems to remain consistent and, once connected to any device, I've never experienced any drop in the signal.",5,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0

"So far so good. I have only had these for roughly a week and love the sound quality from these. I have yet to put them to the test with the waterproof feature. I was able to connect both sides to my phone easily. One of the things I liked is that these came with different sizes (the piece that goes in your ear) so you can find the right fit. These will more than likely be used at work where the wireless feature will come in handy. I, so far, recommend these for those who want true wireless headphones.",5,1,2019-9-8,1,0,0
"work great, pretty good, but they have a tendency to randomly connect to my phone when they're in the case and recharged.

I don't notice this until I either go to use them or see that my phone is connected to a bluetooth device and its them. It doesn't hurt anything just a little weird and mild inconvenience. The sound quality is really good but they can have a little too much bass with some songs. Overall good product and I enjoy them.",4,1,2019-11-22,1,1,0

Not for swimming! They stop the second they get wet. With the description I was under the impression they would work even in water but they do not work in water. It’s good sound quality and tight fit but they are not for swimming or swimmers. They be good if you’re a boater or in a kayak with your phone in a dry bag but that’s about it. They cut the signal when wet. Also the Bluetooth range is shorter than my other Bluetooth devices.,2,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"All the technical aspects of earbuds were great. It was a little loud, so I never went more than the lowest sound level on my phone, but the battery life and sound quality were great. I would have rated this 5 stars, however the left earbud keeps falling out, which is strange considering that the right earbud is snug and fits amazingly. I’ve gone through all the earbud sizes but have been met with no luck. So it feels like I’m only getting half the experience. Other than that, they are definitely worth the money and my issue doesn't seem to be persistent with others’.",2,1,2020-7-26,1,1,0
This is my second pair. The first set of these started malfunctioning about 8 months after purchase. The prior set suddenly stopped disconnecting and charging when they were put in the case.Sound quality is great. Used when mowing the lawn it cancels out about 85% of the sound. They stay in the ear with ease for the most part but did tend to start to slip when working out. Mic seemed to work well. No complaints from others when on conference calls for work.,4,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"Tozo T10 earbuds are a game-changer.  Good sound, wireless earbuds at a great price.  I have worn wired earbuds by Yamaha, NuForce, and 1More.  However, all of these earbuds have eventually broken within a year, likely because of repeated damage from cord snags.  After reading other reviews, decided to give T10 a trial.  Warm sound with appropriate (good, but not overpowering) base response.  Decent soundstage.  I use these predominantly for exercising - not having a cord attached is so freeing - absolutely love it!  Call quality is not great due to lack of noise cancellation - if predominantly using for phone calls, will need something more expensive.  However, at $40, don't have to worry if you accidently lose these.  I did have one earbud stop working 3 months after purchase, but Tozo was very responsive in having a replacement sent (shipping did take some time d/t covid, shipped from China).  In summary, great sounding, great value, wireless earbud for the price - highly recommend - you'll love running without a cord - no more microphonics, no more snags!",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"SECOND UPDATE—Just received the Tozo T6 headphones and wow. Huuuge difference from the previous pair I had. Sound quality is better, they’re more comfortable in my ears, plus they have touch capabilities. I’m very impressed, first and foremost, with the customer service and secondly with the upgraded headphones.",5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"These are excellent earbuds for the price. They sound very high quality for an in-ear earbuds. The pairing is very seamless as well. I especially like the feature when the earbuds are inserted in the case, they automatically turn off. Unfortunately, I did have the right earbud quit working on me. However, a customer support representative (Jet) was very quick to help. I am very satisfied with the quality of this product and would recommend to anyone looking for a wireless earbud solution.",5,1,2020-3-9,1,1,0
"I am generally satisfied with the sound, Bluetooth aspects and love the portable charging box.But the none of the pads fit my ears very well, unlike other buds I have had. They feel like they will fall out, but they are new and may just need getting used to.",3,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
Nice product overall. I purchased these because I thought I had lost a pair made by Taotronics. I got this pair because of the amazon recommendation. They work well enough and make music listening while I work enjoyable.Compared to the TaoTronics  these are actually not as good and a bit more expensive. Thats not to say they are bad just not as good. Sound quality lacks a bit and the carry case is a bit more intrusive when pocket carried. Still a good buy if you need smaller.,4,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
"They look great. The connectivity is bizarrely terrible. The left channel disconnects if I look to the right far enough..... yeah. I thought there was RF interference or something, desperate to blame it on anything other than the earphones themselves. Nope. Went to the middle of a 30 acre parcel of land, looked to the right.... it cut off. Oh, and it cut off on the walk back. Apparently my skinny arms are enough to interfere with the Bluetooth connectivity somehow.  Can’t speak on the battery life because I use them in ~2-3 hour sections, and putting them away charges them again. Truly strange seeing it so highly rated, they do seem to look good enough. Maybe it was the specific set I got. Maybe it’s Maybelline. It’s definitely a refund.",1,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
"After posting this review customer support contacted me and said they would happily replace them.  only i had to send them the old ones and wait a week.  So i ended up paying about $8 more and waiting another week to recieve earbuds,  which they told me later well you didn't have to return them but.... they now have battery issues within about a month of me using them twice a week.  The battery at best last about 2 hours now.  i would return these if i could get my money back in a heartbeat.These earbuds sound great love the base  and they are comfortable to wear.  But they have odd connection issues, like they seem to loose connection to each other on and off or loose the signal momentarily and then come back.  they also seem to be pretty laggy on anything with video.  I've tried this on multiple devices, and it seems pretty consistent. sometimes it so often you can't hear anything but on and off and on and off.",1,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"I’m very impressed by these ear buds. They came pre-charged because they were ready in about 10 minutes. They automatically pair to each other when you remove them from the charger then took 3 seconds to connect to my phone. They come with 4 different ear caps to adjust to your comfort ability. I haven’t been active yet to see how they stay in the ear but Volume, bass and noise canceling are all pretty good so far.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,1
"I bought a pair for both me and my boyfriend to use during our workouts and we love them so far.  The sound plays great and the price was even better.UPDATE:  My boyfriend's left earbud was going in and out, so I contacted TOZO and they are sending me a new pair!  I don't even have to return the old pair (such as hassle)!  This is what customer services is all about.

"The right (master) side connected once. Then died. The right side shows no light. I charged for 24 hours. Right side totally dead.The left side works well. It connects quickly and stays connected.

"The Tozo T10 wireless Bluetooth earbuds are such a great product for the price. Pairing and syncing the earbuds to devices is quick and simple. The sound quality is really exceptional, especially considering the price of them; I was truly surprised. The bass is punchy and mids and highs are well rounded. I find the battery life to be pretty good—I can get about 4 hours of use from them on a single charge. At first I thought that kind of sounded low, but I realized there isn't really a point in time where I have earbuds/headphones in for that long anyway.The earbuds come with a super cool charging case that is a remote charging battery. You can plug the charging case into any USB device and it will fill the battery pack. You can then place your earbuds into the battery pack which magnetizes and secures them in the sturdy battery case and it will charge your earbuds on the go. The earbuds charge fairly quickly. You can tell they are charging by the red LED light on each earbud. Likewise, the battery charger/case has four (4) LED lights that are blue, which lets you know how much power is available in them.",5,1,2019-9-15,1,0,0
"If only there were a zero star review. They developed the different functions to work off of 1 tap, 2 tap, and holds. However, there is ZERO button feedback so you have no idea what finger inputs have been received or not received, which then leads to songs skipping, it pauses, etc. The only way out of the ""loop of confusion"" is to power them down. Which seems to only work half the time as well.  Also the button is so sensitive that you accidentally tap every time you need to adjust the bud position in your ear. SO your skipping songs that way too.  Bottom line you can't create a multi function single button device with no button feedback. This is electronics basics 101!!!Next is the sound quality. 1 star there too.  Comparable to what you get form the 10 dollar Walmart/convenience stores. No bass, lacks volume.",1,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
So I’ve been looking for new wireless earbuds for a while I was almost dead set on waiting for the price to drop on sonys newest WF-1000XM3 but after losing my air pods I finally made the jump to buy something now. These for sound quality is mediocre granted I only used my AirPods at work to listen to music or watch a quick YouTube video but that’s what these are replacing and comparably these don’t sound nearly as clean even with the noise cancellation factor of them being all the way in your ear. Now do they sound good for a $50 WIRELESS earbud yes better than expected honestly. Now build quality wise they’re pretty good nothing exceptional but they don’t feel cheap either. As for the case it’s a different story feels like cheap plastic case and it’s bulkier than I anticipated. I was hoping for something smaller but I may just have been spoiled by apples AirPods. When it comes to comfortability I definitely will say for someone with really small ear canals even using the smallest rubber fittings they’re pretty uncomfortable they hurt my ears after about 30 mins of use and now you can take that with a grain of salt because I have avoided wearing these style in ear ear buds for a long time for that fact alone I would suggest picking up a memory foam fitting if you plan on wearing these for longer periods of time. But all in all a decent pair of total wireless earbuds for the price I don’t think I’d buy another pair if I lost these though I’d either go back to AirPods or look for something else maybe worth a few more dollars from a reputable brand like skullcandy jbl sennhesier Bose or Sony.,3,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"First set of wireless headphones I've purchased. I was pretty pleased to see the sale price and had just decided it was time. The noise cancelation is pretty amazing. I have a toddler who sat next to me, talking, and I couldn't hear him at all.I haven't had the opportunity to use during a phone call and will update when/if I do (provided I remember), but my husband has a similar pair and did voice chat recently. Everyone he spoke with said they could hear him very well.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
"Sound quality is great, in a busy gym though now that everyone has a Bluetooth earbud the connection will easily break if it's in your pocket.My main problem however is that even though both ear buds turn off when placed into the charger either one will randomly turn on again and connect to my phone. This is extremely annoying when I'm connected to my car's Bluetooth and suddenly it stops because the TOZO decided to wake up.",4,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"These little guys are amazing! They come halfway charged with very simple instructions to pair and set up. The noise cancellation is awesome. My ears are also really small so the extra (smaller) ear bud things were helpful. They come with an extra 3 sets varying in sizes. I debated between these and Apple air pods for a while before purchasing. You can’t beat the price, sizing accommodation, or sound quality. I’m definitely going to get a set for my boyfriend as well!",5,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
"These are decent headphones when they work. The problem is that each ear is independent and each loses signal at different times.  This makes it really disorienting when walking outside, making you think there is a call or some one is near you. This happens so much that is has become near impossible to use if I am moving around at all. This is so bad I am now shopping for a better set.",2,1,2020-10-5,1,0,0
"Phenomenal sound, and they fit perfectly. I, personally, don't have to use the included different sized earpieces, but I can't imagine anyone would have an issue with sizeThe sound is absolutely great! And I love that I can wear them in the shower without issue.",5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
Returned these after a few days. Reasons:1. Like to listen to podcasts/music while going to sleep. These have pretty bright blinking lights in the dark—wife didn’t appreciate it and plus I felt like a freakin borg.,2,1,2019-6-19,1,1,0
"Just got these, so I will have to update after I have used them for a while, but shipping was quick, package is well made.  Took several hrs for first charge.  No prob pairing with my iPhone.  They sound great!  Haven’t received a call yet, so can’t comment on that.  So far I am very happy with my purchase.  The quality seems great for the price!  Comfortable to wear.  I did change to the smallest size, but the med that was on when I opened them wasn’t a bad fit, just like the smaller better.  So far, so good!!! 👍👍",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
I purchased these earbuds for use at work (I am a chemist and work in a laboratory with constant noise) and I could not be more satisfied with the quality that I received in these T10 ear buds. The noise cancellation paired with the cutting-edge sound technology makes for an experience that must be had. Have you ever had Johnny Cash play just for you? That is the quality of what you get with the TOZO T10 ear buds!,5,1,2019-6-22,1,1,1
"The sound quality is awful. Neither the case nor the earbuds hold charge. The bluetooth connection is spotty at best with a range that is worse than normal. And the body of the earbuds is so bulky that it slips around and hurt my ears. I could only wear them for a little bit at a time. I know i should have expected them to be poor quality for the price I was paying, but held out hope. Don't bother with these — save your money and get the new AirPods.",1,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0
"I really love these headphones. I only purchased again because I lost the right side. Make sure to get the warranty! They really are waterproof (splash proof) too. If course I've only used them like in the shower occasionally, not fully submerged in water. The sound quality is amazing. I have really small ears and they fit so well because they give you different sizes for the earplugs. Definitely worth the price.",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"I've only had these for the last 24 hours but I can already say that I am extremely pleased with the quality and fit of these wireless earbuds!  I wore them for a solid 6 hours while finishing up my work day and going home to cook dinner/meal prep and I didn't feel like they hurt my ears at all for that extended period of time using them.  I've primarily been using them paired with my cell phone for listening to music but I also tried them out on a lengthy phone call and was told that my voice sounded crisp and clear (which was an issue I experienced with some wired headphones).  All in all, I'm excited to continue putting these to the test in different scenarios (gym, mountain biking, trail running, etc.).",5,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
This is my 2nd pair. The 1st keep falling out and very heavy and I returned them...These are stable and actually stay in the ear canal reducing outside noises..fits like a glove in my ear and not weighty. After 20 days Ive notice there is not a power off feature on these..nor an option to use Only the left or right as I have to have1 ear open for work. It would give alot of usuage if I could alternate both l/r but it uses same charge for both at same time. Also once used and disconnected it has to reset to the charger box just to reuse..thats a hassle!,2,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
"I do not recommend this product to anyone, pairing with any Bluetooth device is too difficult, I tried to pair it with three different Smartphones, and it was really too complicated, when I finally did it, just with one of them (Left) the sound is not as good as I expected, it's only acceptable. The seller only gave me a very vague answer when I wanted to ask for help with the pairing. Never again did the seller give me any answers, therefore I had to ask for the money back, which seems to take more than three weeks. Very bad seller, very poor technical support, and the product is not of very good manufacturing quality. Not recommended ... PLEASE!!!!.. Do not buy this product.",1,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
"These TOZO T10 BT 5.0 earbuds are the best I've ever had.  Most importantly, they stay in your ears.  All you do is twist after placing in your ear.  The sound is great.  Pairing is always a hassle with other earbuds, but these are a piece of cake.  The wired charger is great.  Place the buds in their two places in the charger (they fit) and lower the lid.  All done.  The BT reception range is not a long distance, but when you come back in range the music is still playing.  I can't ask for more.  The documentation is easy to read and I had these buds up in running in minutes.  No wonder these buds are ranked right after Apple's AirPods and before everything else on Amazon.The best is TOZO has been in touch within the month and wants to send me a wireless charger at no charge.  How cool is that?  Can't go wrong with these TOZO ear buds.",5,1,2019-8-22,1,1,0
"They are very lightweight, comfortable, and sturdy. When fully charged, the case itself provides 2 full additional charges, which you will need as the battery life isn’t great. From dead to fully charged it takes about 30ish minutes and they last just about 3 hrs. My biggest issue with the short battery life is the fact that you’re given no warning when the battery is low, so you can be in the middle of something and they will just die on you. Also, the buttons on the earbuds which let you answer calls/pause/skip are pretty stiff and you will end up shoving the bud into your ear for it to actually work......",4,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"Great sound. Bluetooth goes at least 10 meters (30 feet). Easy pairing. Cool charging station with lanyard that stores 3 more charges.  Good bass response, very clear highs. Immersive sound. Good price, quick delivery. I bought these before I received my Jiveminipods, which I expect to be a big disappointment after hearing these. Comfortable. For less than 10 more bucks, go with these instead.  Nice boxing, nice manual, nothing wrong here.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
I have had wireless earbuds in he past and I would have to say these are the best! I workout with these each day and I cannot express how content I am with the quality.There was one instance where the two earbuds did not connect to each other and I was only hearing music from one earbud at a time. I messaged the customer service and they sent me a replacement immediately. I was very happy with this entire product.,5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
So far these have been a nice surprise.  The bass is full though the mids and highs are slightly muddy... but maybe im just getting old?  I've never been a fan of earbuds as they always seem to either make my ear holes sore and/ or one or both constantly pop out of my head....Not so with these! So far these fit nice and snug (annoying without sound as they act like ear plugs the sound of breathing fills my head) and they keep all the noise you don't want out while the sound stays inside your head where it should be. Not too shabby at all!,5,1,2019-6-1,1,0,0
"They are great quality.  Some people might want to hear what's going on around them,  and yes there could be safety issues because they very heavily block out any sound. I, however, really like the complete separation from sounds around me while I work out.  No screaming kids, no people talking bs. Nothing but me and my tunes.  I can hear people scream or very loud things, but nothing of a reasonable volume gets through.  When I am done listening and put them back in the case, they routinely reconnect (by proximity only) to my phone and this drains the battery. So that really sucks because I'd be ready to use them but then they've been drained from this unsuspecting connection.  Happens pretty frequently.",4,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"Awesome earbuds. Fit great, block out outside sounds. Quality sound. Lasts decent amount of time on a charge - I just have to remember to keep them charged in between use. Not sure if it’s me, but if I don’t keep them charged, they seem to loose charge between uses. More than happy with them though. Used them during a half marathon and they lasted the full 13 miles.",5,1,2019-8-17,1,1,0
"I like these earbuds although the first version is a tad large for my ears. The sound is very good, battery life is about 3 hours with constant music and the price is great.

"I'm generally pretty skeptical when I see sponsored ads/posts on a website describing a tech product, and so I was with the T10 wireless earbuds. But for the price, I decided to give these a try, as the prices from the leading tech companies are just too much for me to spend. After getting these last night and letting everything get the initial change overnight, I gotta say, I'm VERY impressed with them. The sound is fantastic with deep bass and great highs, the pairing process was dead simple, and the cost ... yeah. Believe me, you need to get these. Time will tell on the durability, but the T10's are worth MUCH more than they cost. Your ears will love you!",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
Sound quality is greatI bought these for the wife to work out with and she was afraid that they would not stay in because of other brands having the same issue. She was very impressed by them and says that they have great fit.,5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"These come with 4 different sizes of ear caps, and as I have very large ear canals, I wanted to try the largest ear cap.  However, it is impossible to get installed onto the earbud.  Using any other size works, but the sound is just way too tinny.  I suspect I'm not getting a good fit due to the incorrect size of ear cap.  Sure would be nice if I could get the largest one installed.  Overall, they seem to be a good quality earbud, and I love the fact that as soon as you remove them from the charging case, they pair to my iPad automatically.  However, if I cannot get the largest ear cap installed, or get decent sound from the ones I can install, then I'll be looking elsewhere for earbuds.",2,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
They sound good. My issue is that I ordered myself a black pair and they have a push button that when you push it to pause it goes further in your ear. Later that month I ordered my wife a white pair and hers has a touch feature instead of a push button. Not a big deal but it's a lot nicer with touch. Also my case has to be charged pretty often where hers has only been charged once. It's almost like I got a refurbished pair. Also my left ear bud keeps cutting out.,3,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0

Update: One of the earbuds (left) stopped working on the replacement pair.  I also ordered a different set of headphones from the same seller because the audio quality was good.

"So I don't really have a break down of pro's and con's for this, so I'll just lay out my thoughts.First and foremost, I accidentally left these buds in a pair of pants, and ran them through the wash. After blowing out some water, and resetting the headphones, they are still working 2 weeks later. I also wear them to the gym, and sweat all over them, so the water proof part seems to be true.",5,1,2019-8-27,1,0,0
"Good,The product has really crisp and nice bass. It’s pretty comfortable to wear since it is truly wireless earbud. The build quality is pretty nice too. The case has a solid weight and the earbud itself is very light. The material used in these are pretty solid.",4,1,2019-1-28,1,1,0
"Got these headphones a few days ago and so far have been very pleased. I've had decent success with off brand headphones in the past but each have had there issues. I haven't like the wire connecting the sides, some have poor sound quality, others say they are waterproof but just a shower ruins them. I haven't tried these in the water yet but every other aspect has been superb. No cord between is awesome, super light, easy to use, but the best part is the sound. The sound quality is off the charts better than my past experiences. I think the only thing I've found that isn't 5 star is the timing of the sound is sometimes just barely off what is happening on the screen. Sometimes the words spoken are just a hair behind the mouth moving and I don't know if that's a headphone issue or a phone issue as I've recently gotten a new phone. Other than that, these are far and away superior to past experience.",5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"Five stars despite terrible sound quality because they work great. The charge lasts up to a couple hours (amazing really), then you just drop them in the magnetic case and (assuming you remembered to charge the case) they start charging immediately.  You're good to go again in only 20-30 minutes.  Very convenient.  Not very loud, music sounds horrible, but great for podcasts and books.",5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0

So first off I wanna these headphones are exactly perfect for my situation I work construction therefore AirPods are a bit pricey to be having around my field of work further more the quality is excellent they completely block outside interference and bring you true in depth audio with proper bass to hit all those deep tones also the water proof functionality is no joke I’ve never submerged them as it says not to do so but I have gotten them wet and they still work perfectly fine and the customer service here is also nothing to worry about they are definitely organized and on top of the game I highly recommend these phones coming from an audio engineer it should be 6 stars rated,5,1,2019-8-22,1,0,0
"Just received these. First impression: this are exactly what I wanted.I dont love the look of air pods and I have ear buds that have the cord connecting them to each other, but are wireless from the phone and I sometimes struggle with those too and getting them caught on things.

i love love these! i was using regular headphones at the gym and i was always embarrassingly getting caught on things while switching equipment. i didn’t want to pay $200 for airpods and i’m so glad i didn’t! these are great for working out even when my ears get moist they stay put. and they really do cancel noise so i can’t hear the grunts of people maxing out on their dead lift. superb compact design allows me to wear them at work with a headband!,5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"I was a bit skeptical about these headphones, but went ahead and ordered them based on all of the positive reviews.

Just what I was looking for.... Well almost... I wanted the sound of a $200 dollar pair of headphones in a pair of a $50 pair of earbuds but honestly that's not very practical thinking.  They do have a rather good quality sound and pair nicely. The charging case is pretty nifty also.  Hopefully they last currently enjoy using during workouts.

So the Tozo T10 5.0 wireless ear buds are my first set of true wireless earbuds but had many traditional headphones and earbuds with wires and those wireless earbuds that use a wire to link both sides. With that being said I'll never look back!First off the Tozo's were a great deal with awesome reviews for under $50.  I've payed $80 for wireless Skull Candy's and there is no comparison.,5,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"Fit and sound are good with these earbuds. Some other buds offer ability to click a button and hear ambient sounds. These buds do not have that feature and almost completely block out ambient sound, which can be good, but I wish I had the option to hear people talking. Also, I wish I could control volume (or even skip tracks!) with these buds. But they are good for what they are. Didn't know they were waterproof when I purchased, so that is a bonus!",4,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0

"In all fairness, I would give these something closer to 4.5 but for the problem with Firestick.  It's not possible to reduce the volume when paired with a Firestick (to watch TV)... a previous reviewer, who had the T6 model says just hold the left button down for 3 seconds, but that turns off the T10 version.  Since I bought these to watch TV it means they are virtually useless to me.  Disappointing, and I would ask for a refund but I live in South America so it's not possible to return them.",2,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Happy with quality, built and sound the customer service is what we all are looking for. I had a small issue with one of the earbuds and they took action rather fast, I got an immediate email from Mrs. Carol which helped me to resolve an issue with my right side earbud. I love that the company took action fast no questions asked, this is what we are all looking for, Amazon has the same approach, Kudos to TOZO service Dpt. for jumping to create a complete satisfaction experience. I recommend this company to anyone considering purchasing quality sounding Earbuds, affordable and most important, Customer satisfaction driven approach.  Keep up the awesome work.",5,1,2019-7-30,1,0,0
"I have been using the TOZO10 wireless ear buds for almost a month.  So far, this product has met and exceeded my expectations. One of my main concerns with looking for a budget priced set of earbuds was the water proof-ness of the product. So far, these ear buds are working properly in heavy sweat conditions during workouts. These ear buds pair easily with iPhone X. One feature I like is that you can leave them paired,  place them in the charging case, and when you take them out they will turn on and  reconnect automatically. This is one of the best Bluetooth  pairing experiences I have had and paring  is seamless with iPhone. The charging case is really durable and has wireless charging capability. After four weeks of regular use, I can tell these buds are a solid value for the price. They have a great battery life as well. I would recommend this purchase!",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,1
"The Tozo T10 earbuds have great battery life, I can use them all day on and off and still have 25 - 50% left on the wireless charger case. The wireless charging works great, but when it isn't perfectly aligned, I have noticed a strange high-pitched whine coming from it. Also the fit took some getting used to, but now that I have it down, they stay in pretty well. I don't find them to be super comfortable, but I'm still getting used to them. The sound quality is ok except the volume is realitively loud with no way to turn it down from the earbuds even with low volume from the phone. The microphone is okay, but it's a bit too quiet, and I couldn't get it to work with Windows 10. It works with Android though.  I'm pretty satisfied with these for the price.",4,1,2019-5-9,1,0,0
"Wireless charging doesn’t actually work at all. The lights go on but nothing actually happens beyond that. I’ve been told that they pick up background noise when in phone calls.If just using them as headphones they’re pretty good. For $50 the wireless charging was like a bonus to me so I wasn’t entirely butthurt about it not working, inconvenient mostly since I almost exclusively use wireless charging for my phone it would have been nice to be able to charge my headphones wirelessly too (you know... like they were advertised)",3,1,2019-9-24,1,0,0
"These turned out to be far too uncomfortable to me for long-term use.  I can't speak to the sound quality because I couldn't have them shoved into my hear long enough to give an accurate opinion.I'm sure they might work right and can be sized for most folks out there but for me, for whatever reason, these just didn't work.",3,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
I love these earbuds.Sound is great for this price range and battery life is descent.,5,1,2020-6-9,1,1,0
I am very disappointed in the long term use of the buds.They cut out and can not be more then 5 feet away from my phone without them cutting out.,1,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"I bought these after seeing great reviews on Amazon, and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. Right out of the box, the setup was easy, and the sound is very good, for a set of buds in this price range. I love the charging case, too. Great quality all around. I'd definitely recommend. One note: the left ear bud might be a bit static until you do a full reset of both buds. Easy and fast. Not sure why this is needed, but it fixed the only issue I had. The instructions recommend doing it. They stay in my ears even when jogging, too. Very nice.",5,1,2019-5-28,1,0,0
"I bought these ear buds to go with my new Vivoactive 3 Music watch. They arrived quickly. The package had the charger, USB cable, ear buds and an assortment of ear caps. My charger had 3 blue dots indicating almost a full charge right out of the box. No need to wait for the first charge. The ear buds paired with the watch easily and have good sound. I am still experimenting with the ear caps for the best passive noise cancellation for me. I have not run any battery life tests for the ear buds yet since the watch only has a 5 hour battery life when playing music. I think the buds will outlast the watch in play time if I alternate left and right buds in the charger.",5,1,2019-8-16,1,1,0
"The product arrived on time and in perfect condition. The ear buds sound great, but the problem is that it didn't come with different size ear bud covers like the directions talk about, the battery only last half day even though it was on the charger all night and it pauses itself constantly. Otherwise no other issue's. The thing I like most about it is that the volume will go down when you turn the volume down on the phone unlike a different type that I also have.",4,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
They will not stay in your ear.  I bought 3 sets for me and my family.  The sound is decent if you are sitting still.  The sound is quite good sitting still.  I was hoping to use these for video calls with client so I could talk without headphones on.  The mic is terrible.  I tried calling several different people with different phones an the mic is just bad. I regret buying and would not recommend these.  Good customer service though!,4,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"I love these ear buds!  I lost one in the yard when it fell from my pocket and I didn't notice.  It lay in the yard for two weeks of heavy rain storms.  The yard was mowed twice before my wife found it.  It had one nick in the ear bud from the mower blade.  I plugged it into the case, it charged right up and worked fine. I am totally impressed!  I would recommend them to a friend and I would but then again!",5,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"I got these headphones in March 2020 as all my meetings moved to Zoom and I found myself in my phone all day. Overall I loved the size (my ears are small and the smallest silicone pads fit well in my ears) and the sound quality. I’d have to knock off a star however for battery as the case conked out after less than three months and wouldn’t charge. I tried a different charging cable, to no avail. I’d give higher marks to customer service though, who emailed me back in 24 hours. Fingers crossed that the replacement case will last longer than its predecessor.Updated June 8, 2020: customer service was extremely responsive and I received a replacement charger box promptly. It’s a pleasant surprise how easy they were to correspond with and I’m glad that I now have working earbuds again as I like the size and quality of the earbuds themselves.",4,1,2020-6-9,1,0,1
"I bought these earbuds more than a year ago - they are a solid product.  A good fit in my ears, with great battery life.  At first, the audio quality was impeccable, although recently, people I talk to over my phone sometimes complain they cannot hear me (when I switch to Speaker phone, it's fine).Also, a note about the seller.  I had problems with the left earbud in that it was not synchronizing with the right earbud (when you can hear simultaneously out of both).  The seller sent me a number of Facebook Messenger messages instructing me how to reset the earbuds.  When that did not work, the seller offered to replace the left earbud free of charge.  This is what I call great service!",5,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0
"I've used my earbuds about a dozen times now and the sound quality is good outside of occasionally there is a sort of audio  hiccup.  It's not super frequent, and sound returns to normal a fraction of a second after the hiccup, but it is worth mentioning.  Beyond that I've had no problem at all with my ear buds and they seem like good quality for the price.  Not difficult to set up or anything either.",4,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"This may work with a phone to adjust volume, but I want to use it with my Samsung TV.  It pairs up just fine, but I have no way to adjust the volume. The volume control on the TV has no effect on the buds. These are like putting my ear up next to a running lawnmower engine just inches from my head. I like everything else about them. I hope they make one with some volume control.",3,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"The battery life is eh on these, and while the sound quality is great, they don’t stay in my ears no matter which size rubber pieces are on them. They pair individually to your device which is a nightmare to get them to work together. They also only control pause/play and answering phone calls ending them. Didn’t realize they did not control the music entirely from the headphones until I searched thru reviews...",3,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"After reading the positive reviews I decided to give them a try. I was excited when I finally received them. I love listening to music and audio books through them. The sound is clear and the battery life is perfect.  I contacted customer service regarding a small issue I was having with my earbuds and the service I was provided was professional and quick. If you want a good wireless earbuds with a company that is friendly, courteous and professional then Tozo earbuds are for you!!!!",5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"First set of bluetooth in-ear headphones and I have to say I'm impressed. I've had them for a few months now and I really like them. The sound quality is very good, the battery life lives up to what it states (I can easily get 2.5-3 hours of continuous use at work) and it comes with a ton of different sizes of earpieces, which is nice. I have somewhat smaller ear canals, so having options is a must.These probably wouldn't be a great option for working out or a lot of movement, as I've tried all the earpiece fits and they don't tend to stay in too well when moving too much. Not a big deal for me, but some folks may need to know that. Still, great value for the price.",4,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"These headphones so far seem really amazing! Unboxing them was super easy as well as pairing them. Sound quality isn't perfect but for $40 I'm not complaining. They're also super easy to charge. Able to change sizes from S-XL. I will say that if you have small ears they are a little bit on the bigger side but not anything too bad. I have Bose noise-canceling headphones and the noise canceling on these don't come close to those but again, for $40 earbuds having any kind of noise cancellation is really amazing. The buttons on the headphone themselves is a BIT touchy but not unbearable. Also, I LOVE the color. I got the gold ones and the color is really pretty. If anything changes, I'll update this review!",5,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"I initially bought these earbuds for running.  They were recommended to be by a fellow runner.  At first they were the perfect purchase.  The sound is great.  They fit great and I love the lack of wires.  However, I have had continuous problems with the connectivity.  I have to repeatedly put the ear buds back in the case and take out to get connected.  Often as soon as I get them in, they disconnect and I have to start the process over.  While just walking around the house all is fine.  Once I start to get a distance away on my run, they disconnect and reconnect at will...often.  It is very frustrating.  I have started carrying the case with me when I run so that I can put them in it for a second then take them back out. This helps reconnect.  But this defeats purpose...as I wanted less to carry when I run and not more.  Also, when I get into certain areas on my run I get static sounds.  Sometimes the music pauses and then I lose connection.  And then I have to start the reconnect process all over which throws my run off completely.  I wish I didn't have these issues as I loved these earbuds when I first got them.",1,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
I purchased this item looking for something that would not have any restrictions from something hanging or an extension of the item. I also wanted something that was water resistant and sweat resistant.After reading the reviews for this product on not only Amazon but also outside resources. I also researched the company and read really good reviews on how they take care,5,1,2019-11-21,1,0,1
These earbuds are awesome for the price!  They fit comfortably in my ear and I have had no ear fatigue using them for a few hours.  The sound is clear and volume has a wide range.  It was easy to charge and setup with my smartphone and charges fast!  The best thing is that they are so cheap!! I have galaxy buds and would be on the fence about replacing if lost...these I am about to buy a set for my 12yr old and not blink about it!,5,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
"I had to replace the order twice because the left earbud would not connect or hold battery. For the first order, the left ear bud did not work at all. The replacement was not a better deal. After a few days the left earbud would not hold battery and, it would turn off after a few second. I called the tech support and she refunded the money. Sound quality was great but I would not trust this product anymore.",2,1,2020-6-16,1,1,0
"The sound quality, especially for under $50, is great! The different sized earbuds help keep earbuds in ear. The charge lasts 3 to 4 hours; however, I never timed it. My ear canals are large (I guess?). So, I do have some difficulty keeping the earbuds in place, especially when running or doing ""jumpy"" exercises. For me on exercising with buds, this product is better suited for weightlifting than jumping around a lot.  I also recently cleaned some corrosion (green stuff) that had formed on a connector in the unit's charging box (Q-tip & rubbing alcohol--a 2-minute job). Other than that, I am mostly satisfied with the purchase.",5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"You can tell as soon as you open these headphones, quality is of great importance to this company. The packaging is professional, and the charging case and headphones are very sturdy and well-made. I bought these because they are IPX8 waterproof, and so far they have not disappointed. Other brands have given me issues on long runs from sweat or rain, but these are working great so far.  The sound quality is great, and the bass is deep. I recommend these to all my friends now.",5,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"I've been using a pair of AKG's for years now. Finally decided to lose the cord and went with these on a gamble. So glad I did. The bass is scary good. Everything is clear, treble, mid range, everything. I cannot believe the price for these for how good the quality is.The tips are comfortable, though I may look into foam ones just because I've always preferred foam over silicone. One tip was missing in box but thankfully not a size I needed.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
I use these for my daily walks. They sound amazing. I’ve never had a pair of buds with such a clear sound. I had a little trouble keeping them in my ears until swapped out the earplug (they send various sizes). Now they fit perfectly and never fall out. They always pair and connect flawlessly. I have had a lot of trouble with other brands getting the left to pair with the right. I’ve never had that problem with these. Definitely a good value!,5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"The earbuds worked seamlessly and well out of the box. I use them while working out and when working at my desk. I can still hear outside noises when needed for safety, but can listen to  to music without disturbing others. The earbuds are comfortable even during my runs and they fit securely. Using my earbuds as a headset with my phone is easy as well. The audio quality is at least stereo Hi-Fi and the earbuds paired easily with phone, laptop and tablet. Wireless charging and having a large backup power source for the phone and terrific features.",5,1,2019-5-2,1,2,0
"These were great, at first. About two weeks later, the left one kept shorting out and sound only came out of the right. I have tried reconnecting the bluetooth connection but that did not help. I have spent more time trying to get them to work properly than actually listening to any music. Only benefit was that they staying in my ears perfectly fine. I wish I would have gotten a different brand, but that's on me!",2,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
I have the bose wireless earbuds and these exceed them by 1000x. The earbuds for bose would not hold in my ear when running and the volume max was somewhat lacking. I was so surprised when I turned these on and the noise canceling worked on Par or even better than my bose. Not only that but they stayed din my ears through the entirety of my run which by itself is enough for me to write a review.,5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
They auto turn on and turn off and pair fast and just like they should. I only ever had one time where they didn't and I put them back in the case and took them back out and the issue resolved itself. They fit and stay in ear well. Bass is good. I put 4 stars as noise cancellation as a good thing. I think with Bluetooth earbuds designed for things like calling it is good to be able to still be able to hear the world around you. If the volume is up though it blocks out everything.,5,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"These headphones have good sound, are water resistant, and at a very nice price. They come with different size rubber fittings so they will fit nice and snug in any ear. The case is nice and it’s an added bonus having a wireless charging capability. They work great with my iPhone 7 Plus for listening to music as well as making phone calls. The person on the other end said that it sounded great. Well worth the money",5,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
"This is only my second pair of true wireless earbuds (the first pair was another brand), but these are easier to setup and use, and have more features. The setup is so easy, you have to want to mess it up to do it wrong. The sound quality is great, and the noise cancellation works quote well. I just got them, so I really can't say anything about battery life, but the wireless charging case is great. I have a pad that I haven't been able to use for anything, until now!",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"I have had the T-10s for a while now and have to say these are pretty awesome. They don’t fall out as you’re running, and they’re nice for anyone who doesn't want to carry around a pair of big bulky headphones. I can't speak towards their water resistance but they don't seem to have a problem with a little sweat. The price point is difficult to beat especially when compared to AirPods not to mention they are so easy to setup and use. They're amazingly lightweight but don't feel like cheap plastic and still provide great sound quality. If you don't have an iPhone don’t worry about it, they'll work with every Bluetooth compatible device. The basic controls seem to work well with both Apple music and Spotify. They stay in the ear securely and will not come out unless you directly knock one. The case they come in is also very handy, it’s not only easy to carry around but it charges them too! You only need to charge the case and the charge for the case is enough to fully charge the buds four times, so you don't really have to worry about battery life. I use my Tozos daily and have never had an issue with loss of connection or them not connecting at all. As soon as I put them on they instantly connect and I’m free to play my music immediately. Getting them to pair is also tremendously simple. Overall, the Tozo T-10s have made my life easier when it comes to listening to music, they have no chords, no bulkiness and amazingly simple design.",5,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
"I really love these earbuds. They have really good sound quality and the case is really streamlined to use. BUT, there are some connection issues that happen from time to time and it’s annoying when it happens. I also figured out today that the battery life is right at 3 hours, which is a little less than I was thinking. However, with all of that, I would still easily recommend them based on the value alone. For the price you pay compared to others, the few issues I have experienced are no major issue. Plus, you get a one year warranty should you have major issues.",4,1,2019-2-18,1,0,0
"The treble sounds really good although there is less detail at low frequencies than what you get from other headphones. This sort of limitation in audio quality is to be expected even in high-end models that cost 2 - 5 times as much.I bought these reassured that they would be included with at least one pair of ear pads that fit. I've been using in-canal ear buds for 20 years, and I must say that these are incredibly comfortable -- you almost forget that you're wearing headphones. However, this is the loosest fit that I've ever experienced first hand. They're waterproof but they pop out when I'm under water.  I can't even take off my t-shirt without popping them out of my ears.",3,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"Earbuds fits the ear pretty well compared to the other earbuds I have used before. Sound quality is phenomenal. Signal distortion is next to zero. I tried swimming with these but practically you can’t listen to music while swimming because the signal bounces off when your head is in the water. I recommend wearing a single earplug in the side where your head comes off the water for breathing. The other side will get disconnected since it rarely comes out of the water. Not to mention that I was using the front crawl swimming technique. In general as long as you keep your head above water, the earplugs will work fine. Battery life is pretty reliable and probably holds the record for being one of the best earbuds battery life I have ever dealt with. Also, the two sides get paired immediately and sometimes it struggles to detect the phone. A simple restart can easily solve the problem. By so far, the only concern is that it pauses automatically without any user inferences. It has not been a huge hazzle but hope it won’t get any worse.",4,1,2019-2-19,1,0,0
"I already had one pair of ToZo T10 white earbuds and I have always been amazed at the sound quality which I tell my friends these less than $50 earbuds sound like $130 earbuds. Now, I must say, the whole reason for getting a second pair is that I keep ""losing"" one or the other or both of the first pair - just about once per week... maybe even more often - and then end up finding them just before I order another pair of earbuds except for this time (Although on the night the new ones showed up I AGAIN found the white ones). I recognize this is not a product flaw but a user issue and as such, I will highly recommend picking up a pair - or two or three (3x these=price of Samsung's buds) - and enjoy wireless earbuds with sound as good as any on the market and as good as many wired headphones.",5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"After trying a couple other sets of wireless earbuds, here are the top 3 things I appreciate about the TOZO T10s.First, they are very comfortable. I tried another set but they didn't seal well in my ears, and the sleeves had rough edges. I couldn't keep them in more than a few minutes before they started to rub and hurt. But the TOZO T10s have great soft sleeves that feel great and cancel noise well every time I put them in. And they're snug: they don't fall out when I'm working out or running, and that was the main reason I looked at these.",5,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0
"I ordered this item based off of the positive reviews. The package came quickly. Actually, it was perfect timing! I was spring cleaning out the yard and my Plantronics headset just died. I open the box and thought, “maybe these have some charge on them? Sure enough, they did! Another hour and a half of use right out of the box! Paired in moments. Noise-cancellation is to be expected from ear buds (good, as nothing is ever going to beat over-the-ear cans!) I didn’t really buy these for swimming, but I can tell you they stood up to an afternoon of yardwork sweat!",5,1,2019-4-12,1,0,1
"These earbuds were a great bargain! I was really pleased with the quality of sound - I have found them to be plenty loud even with my device set to a lower volume and think they sound great! They were also easy to operate immediately out of box, and pairing was smooth. I especially love the charging case and being able to place it on my wireless charger. I’m also impressed with the mic quality - it picks up my voice better than the mic built into my webcam or laptop and sounds clear. When using these earbuds as a headset on Zoom calls, it seems like the output will only come through the right side, but this isn’t a huge issue and means I can just use one earbud. Customer service has been responsive and quick!",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"I'm only one week into owning this product, so I can't give any insight into how the long the battery lasts or the long term durability of the product. Although, I can give my first impressions on the sound quality, noise cancellation, fit, and overall experience I've had with the product so far. I came from using Bose Soundsport wired headphones and I went through 2 pairs in about 4-5 years. I was initially worried about sound quality coming from a wired 100$ pair of headphones to a completely wireless 50$ pair. Right away I was kind of blown away by the sound quality on these headphones. My expectations weren't super high, but sound quality is really important to me and these definitely surpassed my expectations. It has a nice bass sound when sitting properly in your ear, and they are really loud and fairly clear.  Fit can make or break the experience. It felt great with the rubber tips that came on the product and the smaller set that it came with it. Both worked well with my ears and it's nice to have 4 options to get the size just right. I wasn't expecting any noise cancellation, but these have a great seal and I felt immersed in my music. I think noise cancellation can be affected by the fit and how it sits in your ear. Fit is king with this product. If none of the 4 sets of rubber tips fit properly it's hard to get the most out of this product.My overall experience with the product has overwhelmingly been positive. Paired immediately with no fussing around, sound quality is great for the price, comfortable, immersive, and I love the travel charging case. I only have a few worries and concerns for the long term. But overall, I'm definitely happy with my purchase.",5,1,2019-9-26,1,0,0
I absolutely LOVE these. They exceeded my expectations! I ended up buying another pair as a gift and they loved them as well. Definitely worth every penny. I think they are better than the $200 ones I use to have. The charger plugs into the case the earbuds go in and you charge it that way. It's really convenient. It also comes with a string so you can hang the case around your neck of you want. Buy these. You will not regret it!,5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0

Fits very comfortably in my ears.  I loved this pair so much, I bought a second pair to use while running,.  I am an avid runner, so I had concerns about these staying put while I was running.  Not a problem.  They stay firmly in my ears during my entire run.  Very happy with them in every aspect.",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these earbuds. My first concern was that they would fall out of my ears. They stay in place and the quality is excellent. While I also like that I can use the two independently and they work equally well, they beep. Not sure why but after a while it becomes white noise and helps me ensure I still have them. I love they are waterproof because I have shoulder length curly hair and don’t usually dry it so it’s wet for the first couple of hours each day which is when I use the earbuds first.",5,1,2019-5-23,1,0,0
"I have been working from home due to COVID-19 since March and a significant portion of my day is spent in teleconferences.  I had been using normal wired bud headphones with a microphone in the cord, which worked well, but a colleague recommended that I get wireless headphones.  I chose the T10s based on reviews and it has been a game changer!  The sound is great (both from my end listening and when I speak) and they are very comfortable even for a day of meetings.  The best part is that I am not tethered to my phone and can very easily move about my apartment and not lose bluetooth connectivity to my phone.  All-in-all a great purchase and highly recommended!",5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
They are Bullet proof waterproof and make you feel as if you are in your own world sound better than their t6 counterpart and yes they are a little bigger (t10 are) but you get your moneys worth if your gonna work out and listen to music get these if you are gonna use them more for music and or Bluetooth phone the t6 does our shine a bit overall but for what I use them for the t10 is a clear winner,5,1,2019-11-12,1,2,0

"Bought these in the middle of May and they worked very well, clear and crisp with good bass quality, but had a problem with one of them in August with not wanting to charge. I reached out to the manufacturer since I was outside of the return deadline and they got back to me within 12 hours and are replacing them with another paur for free. Talk about quality customer service, very happy with my order.Plus they fit damn good, just make sure you use the right bud adapter",5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,1
"I don’t usually leave reviews but I got to give credit where it’s due. Are these Beats headphones- NO! However, they are incredibly good for the money- great value. Good cancelation of external noise, base is sufficient, fit comfortably (which is rare for me), and the design looks weird but somehow works really well (you got to twist the headphones while putting in ear for extra snug fit). Anyhow, I’m not a bot or paid by the company. I just think a good product deserves to be recognized. I’ll update if battery life quickly depletes or other flaws pop up.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"First time purchase of wireless ear buds. I know, where have I been!  These are delightful! Easy on my ears, noise canceling was a bonus.  I e always hated the Apple earbuds as they make my ears tender and sore. The sound is amazing and plenty good for me. I can hear things in the music I didn’t hear before. I haven’t had chance to rate battery life but love the magnetic charging case. Nice form hold doesn’t make me worried they can slip out.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
Everything about about these feels like quality. Even the packaging is durable and attractive. The instructions are clear. I thought having to pair two devices would be a hastle but you just follow the instructions and once paired they connect with your phone automatically when you take them out of the charging dock. I was also a bit worried that they wouldn’t stay I my ears while running but they provide 4 steps of different sized earbuds so finding a size that fits and stays put is easy. Love these earbuds and use them every day. Would definitely purchase again!,5,1,2019-3-18,1,0,0
"The T-10 Failed after three months. The company agreed to send me a later model, their T-6,  which they have. I looking forward to using this new product. The other one worked like a charm until the charge station stopped working.  I have an extended warranty on this one, so I have peace of mind.  I will revisit this site when I have some experience with it. Good company to deal with.",5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"I just want to say that I'm impressed with Tozo's handling of an issue.  I bought a set of T10s for my daughter for christmas 2019.  They worked great for 4 months.  Then, Left bud stopped finding Right bud at power up.  After many attempts to re-pair them, I contacted Tozo by email.  They walked me through the steps until it was determined that I could do no more.  Then they sent me another set, no further questions, no returning the old ones.  The new ones are working well.  Thanks Tozo.",4,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"I wasn't sure about the quality of bass but once I got them and put them on the quality is ASTONISHING. I need it somenthing just for when I go to sleep, my Galaxy S20 Ultra came with wired headphones that wearing at night to sleep meant to wake up in the morning with the wires entangled on to my neck, I decided to borrow my wife's Apple AirPods, she use them during the day but not at night and wireless obviously makes a difference. I decided to get my own but for the purpose I need them I wasn't to spend on a pair of Apple AirPods so decided to give these a try mainly because the good reviews..I must just say... I'm getting a second pair for my wife, once she heard the sound quality she loved it specially the BASS which we both agreed it beated hers. I'm glad I decided to give it a try..was surprisingly worth it.",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"I've tried multiple other earbuds before around the same price point, but the biggest issue was that the signal would be lost from just moving into the next room. I wanted something that allowed me to move around and into other rooms without any interruptions in the sound quality. These earbuds do exactly that. The quality of the sound is great, and so is the level that the volume goes up to. The earbuds come in multiple sizes, which is also a plus for those who need bigger or smaller than the standard size buds. So far very satisfied with my purchase.",5,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
"Although there were many reviews for these ear buds, I believe most to be fake. Sound quality on my end was great. The receiving end has a hard time hearing me like I am in a tunnel. Ear buds keep dropping in and out while the phone is in my back pocket. Sometimes you et what you pay for as the old saying. I would not buy again. This is a real review!Harley from Montgomery Texas.

"They work aright, probably about fair for the price. Sound okay but battery quality isn’t great, and it’s easy for them to skip if anything comes between them and the phone for a second. Not a big fan of the silicone tips either, none of the sizes really seem to fit well, if I was going for a run I wouldn’t trust these to stay in.",3,1,2020-1-12,1,1,0
"The sound is great with these earbuds.  They fit in your ear quite well, as long as you follow the instructions on putting them in your ear(s).  I also love the charging case how you can charge the earbuds on the go.  The only downfall, and what gives these earbuds a 4 star is the length of the charging cord, it is very short.  I am sure the most of you have cords that will fit the charger that is longer.",4,1,2019-5-11,1,1,0
"These are great, affordable wireless headsets for those who are not sure whether they want to purchase Air Pods. The noise cancelling is nice, and the sound quality is good. Hooking up to your PC or Phone is a breeze. They are also quite comfortable. I often forget that I have them in.I had an issue with one of my earbuds suddenly not charging a month after purchasing them. When I contacted customer service, there response was prompt and gave me possible solutions to the problem (dirty prongs, charging case issue, reset). After none of those worked, TOZO was nice enough to send me a new pair of earbuds. I don't even have to send them the non-working earbuds back! I would recommend them on that alone. If there is an issue, they work with you to make sure you are satisfied.",5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"I really want to like these earbuds. The features are all excellent and I want them in anything I buy in the future. Problem is, the sound quality is trash. They came out of the box with that annoying buzzing staticky sound that you find in cheapo headphones or good ones that you've ruined by running at full power for a long time.Update: The company contacted me saying that I may have received a defective set. They sent me replacements which work very well. Their customer service was excellent, and I am bumping my score up a star for it.",4,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"Update: The company reached out to me and replaced the earbuds with an upgraded pair. That’s never happened to me before! The new pair is fantastic. Super glad to see a company that takes pride in not only their product, but also takes customer satisfaction seriously!

The sound quality is good, but not great like my previous pair that has been discontinued.",5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"The Tozo T10 is an excellent earbud. Especially for the price. The option of several size ear caps makes for comfort and the ability to stay put in the ear. The sound quality is spot on, with good sound reproduction range.  With the IPX8 function,no worries of moisture damage.Charging and bluetooth function are both quick . Phone answer is good with one push of a button. Call quality is good. Well made product. Recommended.",5,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"A well thought out product.  And,  they sound great.Addition:  I have read some of the other reviews and wanted to make some points known.  While I have received the offer of a free wireless charger, by the time I received that offer I had already written this review giving it 5 stars. I have had many different sets of earphones/headsets from cheap to expensive.  These actually qualify as being inexpensive and for the money, fairly awesome.  The sound expensive and can't be beat for this price.",5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
"Different earbud sizes were difficult to put into these TOZO T10’s, but twisting and pushing works. And I’d rather have a right fit for wireless earbuds held only by that playable plastic. Haven’t had any issues with them falling out. Noise cancellation is roughly that of regular squishy earbuds pushed deep into ear when no volume or nearly quiet point in song is reached. Calm American campus crowd conversing is cancelled out at 15% volume. Loud Americans’ conversation one table over could be heard at their loudest points. Arriving with charge was a huge plus today when they arrived. With the portable charging station, which can be charging while you wear the earbuds, you could wear one, charge the other, indefinitely and go hours without plugging into a wall socket. “Fast charging; 20 minutes charging can provide 1 hour of music play” but they can hold charge for 3 hours’ playing music. Case will “provide 4 full charges”.",5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"5 stars for service. The T10 model fell out of my ears when I was just sitting down. So, I put them in a drawer and left a 1 star review. They reached out and offered to send me their T6 model free or charge or give me a gift card for my entire purchase price. Wow. I just received the T6. They have more earpiece sizes and I really like them. They are currently $10 more than the T10s on Amazon, but they're well worth it. Big thanks to Wendy at Tozo!",5,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0
"I absolutely love these. I bought them to replace another pair I had that wasn’t water resistant. I get when when I’m watering the trees no matter how bad I try not to. These are great. I wear them at work and when I go grocery shopping. They do cancel out noise well. The battery lasts about 2 weeks at a time for me.I came so close to buying AirPods, I am so glad I tried these first.",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"These literally only lasted just over 2 months.Just after I'd had them for a month, they stopped transmitting anything, which meant I could no longer use them for phone calls (I could hear the other person but they couldn't hear me) and using the button on the earbuds to pause/play no longer worked. I tried to return them at that point but I was a few days past the return policy so no such luck.",1,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
The reviews are all true. These headphones are amazing and for such a good price. The small bud covers fit perfectly in my ear. The first page of the guide book is easy to understand and easy to get started using the headphones. I got the white and they look beautiful. The charging box is so nice and I think guarantees I won’t lose one or both of the headphones!! The sound is also impressively clear and I seriously can’t hear anything else. Can’t wait to use these at the gym! Highly recommend.,5,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"When I saw the number of reviews on this item I quickly purchased it. When the first pair had a faulty left ear piece and didn't charge correctly I didn't think anything of it. Then when the replacement arrived and right off the signal keeps skipping and the sound would alternate between the 2 ear pieces I was done. These are not good earphones. Tried resetting the earphones, my phone's Bluetooth, even my phone. Very disappointed with these earphones.",2,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
"These Tozo T10s are the third set of inexpensive wireless ear buds I have purchased within the past year.  They are by far my favorite.  The sound quality is the best of the 3 brands I have.  The wireless charging capability of the case is great, because we have 4 wireless charging pads around the house. These are very easy to pair with my chromebook, Yamaha amp, etc.  For this price point I highly recommend these ear buds if you are considering trying some.",5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"Love these buds! Had the same issue with the left bud cutting out but after ""reading"" the instructions, I got them to work perfect. After pairing them to the phone, they will pair asap upon removal from the case. That being said, to get them to work properly u must first turn off BT from your phone prior to taking them out of the case.  Take the right bud out first, then the left and let them pair together before turning on BT from your phone. I hope this helps others.",5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"I was not expecting very high quality earbuds at this price point, as the only thing I have to compare these to are Apple products and we all know how much those cost. However; these sound just as good as my stepson's AirPods and actually fit my ears more comfortably! I have not tested how waterproof they actually are yet but that wasn't why I purchased, so I'm not very concerned in that regard. These have really surprised me though -- the case is made very well and has a magnetic clasp, the earbuds are kept in place inside the case with magnets, and setting up to pair is super easy. It took me about 15 seconds to get them paired to my phone. I've been using them off and on throughout the day for probably 4 hours or so in total and have had no issues with battery power whatsoever. You can also activate a one-year warranty after receiving your purchase, which is always reassuring.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,1
"I bought these to replace my previous bluetooth headphones which had a wire between the two earphones. I was a little worried that these might just fall out, but actually the way they sit in my ears with the small earbud covers is perfect, they don't move around at all when I jump around/sweat/go jogging. Pretty impressive. Plus the sound is super clear. Excellent purchase. UPDATE 3 WEEKS LATER: Downgrading to 4 STARS. Because although I still love how these feel, fit and sound, the battery life is only 2.5-3 hours at best. And they don't bleep to advise you of this until 2 mins before they power off. UPDATE 5 WEEKS LATER: So disappointed! Now only the right earphone works, the left one is totally dead. The charging box lights are ALWAYS on, which they shouldn't be. I have taken really good care of these but they only lasted 6 weeks :(",4,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"This is my second pair, the first I left on a vacation.  I was happy with them and price was reasonable so I purchased again.  At first I was worried because they would not stay in my ears but I simply changed out the rubber ear pieces and they stay in perfectly.  I lift weights and run with them.  I have no problems with them coming out.  No issues with sweat or water.  Sound is great, bass is very noticeable and battery life is good.  They work perfect for me!  Oh, I also used them on the air plane and helped keep out ambient noise a lot like my more expensive noise cancelling.",5,1,2019-3-6,1,0,0
"I had been using wired earbuds for a while but I found the wires always wearing out at work. I finally bit the bullet and bought wireless earbuds. I have been really happy with it these, I was originally concerned that the charging case would open unintentionally all the time but have yet to have an issue in the time I've had them, the case and the earbuds themselves are built well and have survived some mishaps in the kitchen with no damage or drop in sound quality. Also the battery has not died on me once yet, as long as it's charged most nights it rarely goes below 2 bars of charge. My absolute favorite thing about them is how well the Bluetooth pairs, it's automatic when you take them out of the case and I've never had them give me any trouble, I had one pair of ""wireless"" earbuds before that weren't truly wireless as they were connected by a wire between the two buds that I had to fight to get to connect with my phone.",4,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"Totally in love with these.  This is the second pair we've ordered because my man kept borrowing mine.  The bigger driver gives great bass sound.  The surround sound is so realistic I find myself looking behind me.  I wear them while kayaking and biking almost daily, and haven't had one slip yet.  I've also worn them while showering.  Water resistance is good so far.  I also love the feedback from the button.  I have a very hard time with the buttonless models.  Easy to use, fantastic quality, great price, and unbeatable value!",5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"For awhile I was debating on buying a pair of new Bluetooth headsets. My previous headset was the Google Buds, and I was not impressed. Before dishing out a lot of money on a pair that received mixed reviews, I figured I would try the Tozo. The series of strong reviews drew my attention. I was expecting a lot, yet I am thus far very impressed. Great battery life, fits my ear perfectly, and the sound quality is good. For the price, by far the best pair of headphones I have in my collection.",5,1,2019-9-9,1,0,0
"You can't change songs or podcasts forward or backwards so don't buy these if you are planning on listening to music.  The battery worked for about 6 hours for about two weeks.  Now, it only lasts for about 3 hours.  The sound cuts out a lot when I am just sitting at my computer watching movies or Television shows.  I don't recommend buying these.  I am watching a show right now while typing this review and they cutting in and out a lot.",1,1,2020-6-7,1,1,0
"After my others (brain fart, can't remember the brand, but waterproof, $250ish from Best Buy, not Bose) died I needed something to replace them because....let's be honest, working out at the gym without headphones sucks. Was skeptical cause these showed up as amazon's ""top seller"" or whatever, and usually those are paid reviews. But these have way better sound than I thought, they don't stick out of my ears like I see some of the other brands (JBL / Bose). Huge fan of these. HUGE",5,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"I am pleased to the extreme with these earbuds, which I initially only picked for their affordability and the fact that they were also offered in the color “khaki”, which I really liked. Not only are they very  comfortable to wear, they also stay put in the ear. They have a very good sound quality and cancel outside noises well. No technical knowledge is required, since they effortlessly pair themselves within seconds and are very easily connected to my phone or my IPad via bluetooth. The fact that they can be charged wirelessly in their case comes as a real plus as well, not to mention their portability. This is a five star product, which I very highly recommend.Note: the color “khaki” looks more like a beige/pink, but I like it very much.",5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"I received my earbuds and thought ""well lets open this piece of crap and send it back."" Then I opened the package and saw the box. First of all, the packaging is quality. Secondly, the product itself is beautifully designed and very high quality. So I thought the sound quality would be the factor that got me to send it back; I was flabbergasted. Deep crisp bass and clean treble tones greeted my ears. So then I thought it would have to be the fit - I tested them whilst using the heavy bag, lifting weights, then on a four-mile run. The only time I felt I had to take them out was once during the run when I accidentally knocked the right bud out myself.These things are nuts!! One of the best investments I've made. Right now I am on week two of having them and I love them. At the price, it is a whole lot of bang for the buck.",5,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
"This is my first wireless earphones ever and I must say, I LOVEEEEEE IT! It is worth every single dollar! Pairing is as easy as ABC! Sound quality is great, battery life is amazing. I only use them to and from work (45 mins to 1 hr train ride) so I only charge it like every 4-5 days. I love the fact that it comes with the different size ear piece silicone so it can fit right. If you ever find that only the right side working, place both ear pieces back in the charging pod and take them out again. HAPPY LISTENING!",5,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0

This is supposed to have larger capacity charging case but I'm having to charge after 2-3 hours of use when with my previous pair I couldn't even tell you how much I used them between charging it was so infrequent. Also none of the earbuds fit me properly, they constantly fall out of my mouth ears.",3,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0

Easy pairing, and instructions. Many different sized earpieces to choose from. I would definitely recommend. I bought two.I had a minor issue with the earbuds but I contacted TOZO, and they quickly responded with all kinds of great support and honestly. They completely took care of the issue and went above and beyond to resolve it. Their customer service is very friendly, extremely supportive, and they stand behind their products.

"I've had these headphones for almost one year now, and they've been pretty excellent for the price. For the most part, as long as your phone is near by, these headphones maintain a strong connection to the device and each other. If you are moving quickly (in particular, bicycling) they have a hard time staying connected if your phone is in a leg pocket. I purchased an exercise pouch that goes across my waist, and this purchase pretty much alleviated the issue.The battery life is solid, about 2.5 hrs listening time and about 2 charges in the charging box. The box charges quickly when plugged in.",4,1,2020-7-30,1,0,1
"Usually, I don't believe the ratings or hype, but I decided to give these a try because I really can't live without wireless earbuds. This is a real rating so listen carefully....THESE EARBUDS ARE SIMPLY THE BEST PERIOD!!! I paired these up with my One Plus phone in seconds, without reading even the quick start guide. I did glance at the packaging and I noticed that they said WATERPROOF. Again, I didn't believe it because for sub $50 you don't usually get everything as advertised. Seeing that Sony, Bose (who I love) and Samsung are selling the same type earbuds with less advertised features for hundreds of dollars more.Well, I decided to wear these in the shower - since I purchased the Amazon extended warranty I figured if anything goes wrong I am covered. Well I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!! They performed flawlessly - hence my long review!!",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"After going through my old pair of bluetooth headphones which didn't last me that long, I decided to give this product a shot after reading the reviews. After having them for a few months, the TOZO T10 earbuds do not disappoint at all! The earbuds have an amazing quality sound for such an affordable price and I use them on a daily basis. They're great for people who are very active since they do not fall out and are sweat resistant.The earbuds are a bit large for those with small ears such as me, but with a little adjustment and the correct rubber ear piece (which are provided in various sizes) they fit perfectly. Battery wise, these earbuds have last me for a full work day which is impressive since I constantly listen to music/podcasts. The distance from my phone and the earbud is quality, I can be in another room and still have my music.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"I’m not an audiophile by any means so for me, these sound great. They get pretty loud without the volume being turned all the way up.Unfortunately, I was looking for earbuds that fit flush into my ear and doesn’t make me look like an early model cyberman. These are def not it. They are humongous! They look like they’re literally falling out of my ear and I have to readjust them often to make sure they stay in.  The charging case is very good quality but that is also extremely large.",3,1,2019-9-26,1,0,1
The bluetooth reconnection is less than desirable. Iphone to headphone connection is 1 out 10 without requiring going into the iphone bluetooth settings and manually selecting connect.The battery life is okay.

Below is my initial review for the first pair of earbuds I received. Tozo has since sent me a replacement pair but they are T6 not T10 although I think that's actually an upgrade? I'd give them 3 stars but who wants to receive a defective product and have to return them before getting a similar product that meets advertised performance.Don't know if I got a refurbished pair or if they just have poor QA but all 3 batteries are very poor, about half of that stated in description. Sound quality is worst than 30$ pair I bought these to replace.",2,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"I've been using this product for about a week now, and it's not disappointed! Purchased it a bit tentatively at first, because all the wireless bluetooth earbuds I've purchased so far have been wonky and broke down fairly quickly. I love that the sound has a rich bass, also provides good sound proofing around me. Love the way it fits my ears when applied the right way - they give me sufficient access to information on how to put them on right so that they don't fall off! Used them for a 30 minute run in the rain, and it was water resistant, just like they said! Over all, recommend! I think I might invest in another pair just for running, since it can get quite sweaty and icky (through no fault of the earbuds themselves)!",5,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"I'm glad I bit the bullet and tried these although they are not name brand. I chose these because I wear glasses and around the ear don't stay and over the ear headphones eventually hurt my head from pressing on my glasses. I got them for watching videos while treadmilling it and they have not fallen out yet. Sound quality is good, but my usage is to work and exercise in them, not sip brandy in a leather chair and try to decipher every note. The battery life is good, I haven't run out yet. I will update if they end up being trash.",5,1,2019-5-18,1,0,0
"I generally exhaust at least 3 months of use for new products -- namely electronics -- prior to writing a review, it's essential to be as transparent as possible. I've tried many Bluetooth headphones at low price points, one via Amazon I purchased thrice over within a year alone! Needless to say, they didn't make the cut.These headphones have only been with me since March 2020, but they're reliable, battery lasts for DAYS w/o charge station & cancel outside noise/sound exceptionally. They're a tad clunky, certainly not the most aesthetically pleasing, but very durable overtime!!! Depending on the cushion size they may become a bit loose in ears when exercising (#moisture) but other than that occasional annoyance, they're near to perfect.",4,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"I'm really not sure how these earbuds managed to acquire a four star rating. The sound quality is mediocre at best. The soundstage is flat and sounds like you are under water. The bass it definitely lacking in these, as well. Trying to get them to connect to my LG V30 is a chore. I have to manually attempt to get them to connect each time I take them out of the case. This process usually takes about a minute or two before both earpods are actually connected. Usually only one connects and I have to press the power button on the second eaerbud and hope it connects. Starting today the right earbud is failing to stay connected so I'm only getting audio out of the last earbud. Needless to say these are pretty worthless. I paid $28 for these which was way too much. There are way better alternatives out there from major name brands in the $50 range! Please save your money and headache and go check out the alternatives. You've been warned!",1,1,2019-6-15,1,1,0
"Exactly what I was looking for, I've ruined past headphones sweating at the gym, these are working fine regardless of the extra moisture. They sound great and they stay in my ears comfortably, I almost fell asleep with them on during my initial trial. No connection issues, they pair fairly quick, and they pause and play music when I push the button on either side without delay. I got these mostly for working out to music, so I haven't tested call quality yet, but so far they are everything I wanted. I also love the wireless charge feature.",5,1,2019-5-6,1,0,1
"The over-all quality/price-value is high, but I would not recommend if this is your first experience with wireless headphone technology. The instructions provided aren't overly detailed (but contrary to many other's complaints- the manual does include a table for basic commands including going forward/back, managing calls, etc). Unfortunately- everything besides the pictograph of instructions is ""translated-to-english"" and this makes understanding the written instructions very difficult. The website is the same. Even though I would rate my tech-savvy on the higher end of the spectrum, it took way too long to pair with my first device (phone) and I have been unable to pair with other devices.  If you have owned similar products and are familiar with the basics, it would be a good purchase.",3,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"These earbuds have good range and can be paired individually if you want to one use one at a time. Even when paired as individual devices on your phone, they are smart enough to enter stereo mode when you take both out of the case at the same time. Sometimes I have to put them both back into the case and then remove the one I want to use if I am wanting to go from using both to using only one, but that is a very minor inconvenience.",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
Was looking to buy wireless earphones (I.e. AirPods) but my wife got a recommendation from a friend to get these instead.They were very cheap $35 - and easy to use. Paired right away with iPhone and automatically pairs every time I take them out of the charging case. Great battery life. Haven’t had them die on me despite several hours of use.,5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"The ear buds keep losing connection to my phone even though my phone is only in my pocket. When I turn my head too fast they lose connection. When I bend down they lose connection. When I jog they cut in and out continuously. There's probably someone only wrong with the pair I got. When they do work they're great. But for the most part they just haven't been working properly and nothing I do seems to fix it.They also don't stay in your ears very well. They keep slipping out over time. I tried all the different size ear pieces and it still slips out. And yes, I was putting them in correctly.",1,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"Considering it's price, this is a great pair of wireless bluetooth earbuds.  Sound quality is very good. Overall quality of construction appears solid.  My biggest negative is the fit of these buds in my ears.  Their secure fit relies primarily on the anatomy of the way your ear is shaped. They come with rubber cups of different sizes to accommodate a wide range of ear canal sizes.  I personally found that they were either too small or too large, and would tend to come unseated, reducing noise cancelling and bass quality, forcing me to constantly re-seat them. Inconvenient when you're busy doing something like cutting the lawn.  I very much like the ability to use a single earbud (the right one) for occasions where I don't wish to be totally cut off from the sounds around me (phone, podcasts, etc).  Overall, I'm happy with my purchase but learned that you definitely get what you pay for!",3,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"I got these a few weeks ago and really enjoy them, they are easy to set up and sound really good. The waterproofing is a nice touch as well. Battery life seems a little shorter than expected but its not a significant issue. I did however suddenly have an issue with the audio on the right earbud suddenly becoming quieter than the left so I contacted thier support and they were fantasic, they had me reset them and see if it helped, unfortunatley it didnt but with the one year warrenty they offered to send me a new pair without hesitation.For the price these are definitely worth it.",4,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"I want to like these, and I'll have to put up with them because my other wireless ones died. But there is a weird chopping/crackling sound every so often while a song is playing that just stands out like a sore thumb. After doing some testing (listening to headphone tests as well as general use throughout the day), I found out that when a song is playing two different sounds from the earbuds (say, two different guitar riffs -one in each ear-; or a panning sound where the sound is louder in one ear than the other), the headphones don't like that at all and kind of bug out and make the sound choppy and really hard to listen to. I really hope that I just got a defective unit because these things are comfortable and compact. I can't return them either because these are the only headphones I have that work for my phone (who needs a headphone jack anyways?) I'm really Disappointed with these...",2,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"I bought these to wear while running on the treadmill and they work great. I use them with my iPhone 6 and I'm glad I didn't spend extra money on the apple airpods, which just look silly to me. These seem to disappear under my dark hair and they have similar sound quality whether listening to music or on a call, although I don't use them a lot for calls.

I recommend these especially if they are on sale.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
Usability from just my one case (2-month experience with 3-minute round trip commute 3-5 days/week:(1) Bluetooth connectivity leaves much to be desired. Expect minutes for completion of successful connectivity (both left and right ear components actually “connected”),1,1,2019-9-24,1,0,0
"I recently bought a cheap pair of earbuds and the sweat from my workout turned them into earplugs and nothing more. So, when I looked on Amazon I found the TOZO T10 water-resistant earbuds and made the purchase. I am so glad I did!. Once they arrived I loved the solid feel and case that snapped shut. The case holds about 3-4 workout sessions (about 90 minutes each) worth of charges. I charge the case about once every two weeks and haven't had one time where they were dead. Just pay attention to the 4 blue lights that denote the battery life. The sound quality depends on whether you use the tight fit rubber ear pieces (it comes with 4 sizes). I like to hear/feel the base so I use the small pieces and ""stick"" it in my ear for maximum hold. It took about 2-3 tries to get the right fit that would hold from moving around a lot and sweating during cardio. The larger ones ""felt"" better but the slightest movement and they were falling out. Overall, I am glad I invested in this project and have not had any trouble with pairing, charging, or sound quality. The only issue I have is that you have to pair in the correct order; pair the left with the right...then pair the right with the phone. Otherwise, you're not pairing them altogether. Buy them and be glad you did!",5,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"Bought these like 3 months ago, loved the wireless charging part. the sound quality is good but ok noise cancelation. There is no issues with audio playback, just the microphone. When I am on call and walking outside, the microphones pickup the wind rather than my voice (that's why just 2 starts for noise cancellation).Overall, I wanted to give 4-start but after 3 months usage, my right earbud just died. unable to charge the earbud. Contacted TOZO support team via email they are responsive. Gave few troubleshooting tips, but none helped me out. Support is sending me a replacement, once receive the new set will comeback to post my experience.",3,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
I was skeptical when I first placed my order. I’ve bought Bluetooth earbuds before and they always sounded like speakers you win out of a claw game. Just horrible. These earbuds surprised me. They have amazing sound quality. The noise canceling is not my first choice because I need them for work but it works really well. The fit takes some getting used to and I can’t wear them for long periods of time but the fact that they stay in while I’m moving big boxes are going for a walk or even a run is fantastic. I’m very happy with this purchase and glad that I found them!,4,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"I really wanted this product to work.  The sound was amazing, but on the first set, the left side would intermittently stop working...ever few seconds.  So back to the seller they went.  Second set, no luck - same issue.  The left side would work for a few seconds, then stop working, then work, then stop.  Very maddening.  I tried re-pairing the set, resetting them, all the recommendations.  No luck.  So back went the second set.",1,1,2019-8-10,1,1,0
"Worked well, then left ear started cutting out.. Then then the right.. I was very happy at first. No reason to buy these, they sound great look great. Don't perform well.

Doesn't matter if they are fully charged or where the phone is.",2,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
PROS: Cheap price. Battery lasted for about four or five days. Comes with 1 year warranty.CONS: These are just like any $50 Amazon AirPods. They never stay in my ear.

"This is my first pair of wireless earbuds and so far so good.  The sound quality is pretty good (but not enough noise cancellation to block out the roomie that sleeps on the couch an snores like a freight train) and I've taken some phone calls with them without any problems.  Running into some pairing issues though, probably because I keep switching back and forth between my Macbook and my Galaxy 10. It's a bit inconvenient to have to unpair from one device to get it to register on the other. Again, my first pair of wireless earbuds and I don't mess with Bluetooth a lot so I have no idea if that's simply the nature of the beast or not.  Will say that it usually pairs with the Macbook with no problem, but it usually takes multiple tries for them to pair with the Galaxy, but once it does, I haven't had any problems. I like these well enough to consider simply getting a second pair so the Macbook and the Galaxy each have a dedicated pair.",4,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"I got a new phone and needed a set of wireless headphones for it.  My wife found these and I must say they are incredible.  First, they are filled with features.  I have had bluetooth headphones before but some of them still had some wiring.  These have no wires and come with a high quality storage case that doubles as a charging station on the go.  But as with any headphones, the most important part is the sound.  These have a wonderful warm sound and the noise cancellation is some of the best I've ever heard from a set of ear buds.  Often they don't fit comfy or don't seal properly and you get noise pollution.  These feel like they fit snug yet soft, lightweight, and blocks out all the noise.  I am eager to use them on the go when I have an audio book or watching some of my Masterclasses.  On top of all that, they are waterproof so I can wear them in the rain or shower or while relaxing in the tub.  Highly recommended",5,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0
"These are excellent wireless earbuds that look bigger than they feel. On first opening the box I was convinced they would be uncomfortable and heavy.

Not great, not as bad as the ones you buy on an airplane.  Squarely in the middle.  All of this I could forgive for the price, but what drove me nuts was the inability to turn them off.  I could power them down, but the second you placed them in the charging container they powered on and started pairing with my phone.  If they were in the charger they were on.  Period.  Super annoying.  Returning.",2,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
I didn't really think the waterproof feature to these ear buds was ever gonna pay off for me (I bought them for the positive reviews on sound/battery/wearability-usually ear buds/pods constantly fall out everytime I turn my head). I'm a groundskeeper and custodian and I left the ear pieces in my scrub top and accidentally washed them AND THEY STILL WORK PERFECTLY. They do sometimes fall out but they are way way better than any ear pieces and now I'll use them while cooking or cleaning.,5,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0

I love these earbuds.  I was skeptical because I have had wireless earbuds cut out when using them but these are awesome.  I used them while mowing the yard and they stayed connected the entire time while my phone was in my hoodie pocket.  They are very easy to connect to my devices.  They have a very comfortable fit in the ears with nothing hurting.  I have bought the AirPods two times and both times the right one hurts my ear so I've sent them back.  I definitely recommend these.,5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0

It's still an issue with the new pair, but I've always had issues with headphones cutting in and out so that may be a problem with me? I'm not sure. Anyways I'm happy with what I have for the price. They're simple with only 1 button, but the sound is fantastic. They're definitely sweat proof. The battery life is pretty good considering the size. They're super light. They stay in my ear no matter how hard I try to shake them out. Overall I'm happy. This was money well spent.

Other times, it sounded almost like a radio static in the background and bluetooth connection would cut in and out so often I couldn't make it through a song without multiple interruptions. So when they were functioning properly, they were pretty great, but they weren't reliable.

Short videos on social media can't watch laying down without the left ear completely disconnecting regardless of what side I lay on. Charging is irregular. One earphone charges more than the other. Can't entirely blame on the manufacturers for these issues because I've worked at package handling places such as ups and single handedly experienced how they treat packages, didnt get a warranty either because the warranty itself had very bad reviews.. reason why I gave an ok rating...

The sound can be very loud if thats your liking or at a medium level with little outside noise interference. Outside of running and gym workouts, I use these as I cut the grass. I barely hear the lawnmower. I am also an audiobook/podcast fan and am easily distracted. I am submerged into my book or podcast with these earbuds. Exercise is no longer frustrating as these earbuds fit snuggly into my ears without constant adjustment. To me the best part of these is the pairing ease.

Its a true stereo set. i have another set that doesn't connect both ear pieces at the same time so its nice to get true stereo going. if you use one ear piece at a time u get unlimited use as when one runs out of juice u put it to charge and use the other Ive used the two pieces to give me music hour an 18 hour stretch and still had 2 bars on the case.,4,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
My husband bought these earbuds for him and I soon as I tried them on they became mine.

He received these in December and they still work. Couldn't be happier. Listening to him on the phone with the headphones isn't the best quality but I can still usually make out what he is saying. The sound is good on his end though. I say worth every penny and as always buy insurance just in case.,5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"The ear buds are easy to use, comfortable with a number of adapters to customize ear comfort. Pairing requires some practice but works well once paired. The charger is very efficient and convenient, allowing the ear buds to be stored and charged at the same time. The charger works via an included USB cable and also by placing the charger on a wireless charging station all by itself.",5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
The ear buds have freed up my ability to listen to audio books while I work and Drive.  They also handle cellphone calls with a built in microphone. The sound quality is perfect. One reviewer mentioned blue light blinking in a dark room - yes that happens so just close your eyes or cover your ear buds.  NOT A PROBLEM. There is a reason that these were an Amazon Prime Favorite... which is one reason I bought them.  Amazon has great quality controls and recommendations.  I would buy these again.,5,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
"I have small ears so it is hard for me to find earbuds that stay in. I tried another pair first, and they didn’t fit well, and the sound was quiet. Then I tried these. They stay in my ears 95% of the time, however they stick out very far and don’t fit in the outside of my ear like they are supposed to do they are easy to knock out. They also come out easily when I sweat a lot. The sound is great, but the fit doesn’t work for me. I would have returned but I missed the return window.I wish these had touch control, because you can’t tap to pause. The button is difficult to press so you have to hold the earbud while you push the button. It’s a little annoying.",4,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
I use these almost daily and for the most part they are good.  I listen primarily to audiobooks with occasional music and the quality is good enough for me.My main complaint is the controls.  A tap of the button will toggle play/pause but there is no way to advance to the next track or adjust volume.  A click and hold of the button instead triggers a phone call to the last person I called which is not very useful for me.,4,1,2019-4-10,1,0,0
"I LOVED my AirPods. But I lost them while traveling. I was saving for new ones them came across these. So far they’re awesome. Easy to connect, great sound, and way longer range than AirPods. They’re a fraction of the price too! The one thing that annoys me is that when I adjust it in my ear when it shakes a little loose, it pauses my music. I guess I have to get used to them.",5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
Updated the rating to 5 star.I had originally received a faulty product and left a 2 star review. The customer service rep reached out to me and was able to help solve the issue by resetting the earbuds. They also provided me an extended warranty option and ability to get replacement at no cost. I love that the company backs their product and has great customer service. Highly recommend it to other customers.,5,1,2019-10-4,1,1,0
I absolutely love this product. I bought this product because I have a 3yo and a 1 month old and having earphones with a cord was so annoying because they were constantly being yanked. These headphones work perfectly. They seem to have great noise cancellation so I use one at a time so that I can actually hear what’s going on around me. The sound is awesome. It has good base so songs and movies sound great with these. I feel it’s worth the price. You can’t really go far without the phone being with you though. Maybe about 30-40 feet.,5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"I wanted headphones that will be good for swimming. I think that it’s very important to be able to listen to motivational music while being in the water. Unfortunately, with other headphones I have not been able to do this. These headphones are a life changer! I absolutely love being able to put them in and swim. They don’t fall out, they don’t stop working, they don’t hurt, they’re perfect!!! The sound quality is amazing and I’m able to hear my jams even in the noisy gym and while the water is splashing around me. They double up as great ear plugs too! I tried them out in the shower first (lol) and I love them!!",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,1
"After trying them out, the first thing I noticed is how very pristine the sound quality is!! The bass is enough to rattle your teeth right from their sockets so no complaints there. I haven't really tested to see if they're really water proof or resistant. I just don't think you should mix water with electronics any day of the week. The charging case is a little large but nothing too cumbersome or anything. It's super convenient to be able to charge your earbuds anywhere you are without having to plug it in to an outlet. Love the color!! These things are beautiful and I think they'd impress anybody. Hope this helps in your decision to purchase. I don't think you can go wrong with these for the price! ;)",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
I received these ear buds today.  The case came charged so I was able toStart listening right away.  They were easy to setup and pair with my iPhone.  Great sound quality.  I was impressed with the range when I discovered I was still listening to my audiobook in another part of the house away from my phone.  Will submit another review after I have used these a while. So far I love them.,5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
"These are pretty good headphones - blue tooth is so so with a Mac, they cut in and out a little or the audio bounces between left and right ear but it's workable. I updated this review after being sent updated headphones that work a lot better than the pair I had and I haven't had the charging/case issues with these. Tozo reached out directly which was nice to resolve the issue.",5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
"I liked the fact that with the rubber on the earpiece I was able to screw it into my ear for a secure fit. But this tight fit blocked out too much of the world around me and people I was talking to did not like the sound and we’re always saying are you on a speaker phone, could you turn it off because I can barely hear you.Also the battery life was often less than 8 hours.",4,1,2019-9-8,1,0,0
I rarely and i mean rarely write reviews but i really really like my earphones they are super lightweight and very convenient and yes they don't fall out of your ear unless someone or something touches your ear or knocks u. 99% of the time they won't fall out and i really love the color and sound of the product to be honest this is comparable to the crusher wireless headphones as far as sound quality and base all it needs is a little slide to move up or down the sound of the bass and may i remind u that the crusher wireless start at 100 to 120 dollars and this half no double half the price and it's affordable and convenient only con for me at least is that u can't use one ear phone without the other more specifically the right one if u try let's say u try to charger the right one and keep the left one on it will automatically disconnect and unpair i really wish that would have made the earphones separately instead of having to relie on one earphone but again that's just me and i love the noise canceling it's so much more enjoyable to enjoy music and ignore people and not have to listen to loud people or babies crying or homeless people asking u for money it's great i would highly highly recommend this to people if they are looking for great cheap and affordable earphones,5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"Update! 20200624 reached out to customer service over a defective right ear bud they immediately shipped me out a new pair, I've never seen a more responsive customer service. Definitely a must buy!Best bang for your buck, fits perfectly make sure you put the right ear caps in for maximum efficiency though. Sound quality is amazing for the price! If you have any problems customer support responds right away!!!!!!",5,1,2020-3-25,1,0,1
"I've been using these at work and they usually last less than 3 hours. They sound much better than any cheaper headphones I own, but I'll have my device on my desk (2 feet from my face, tops) and when I turn my head, the sound cuts out of the further earbud. The connection really sucks on these and I wish you could only use one ear at a time but they disconnect if too far away from each other or if one ear is charging the other disconnects immediately. A good first buy but teaches me to be more careful when buying my next pair of wireless earbuds",3,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
Of it looks great feels very premium. Easy to pair no issues with the charging and the Packaging was very nice the only problem that I have is that they fall out of my ears so maybe I needed change the size of the tip but would have been nice to have some kind of better retention mechanism. Although I do see that there are going to offer wireless charging at some point so that's very cool to the case is nice and feels very premium,4,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
"I had an issue initially.  The company went above and beyond - they contacted me, were concerned about my experience, and went out of their way to make things right.  I would definitely do business with them again!",5,1,2020-8-27,1,1,0
"These earbuds are very comfortable and fit nice.  The battery last for me all day at work.  I am going to buy my husband a pair as well.Update:  I am disappointed with these earbuds because I realized you can only pause,hang up phone, redial phone calls, etc.  there is no way to fast forward, rewind Or skip to next song.  I bought these to listen to music, not make phone calls.  Not sure I will use these now.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"I saw a featured article on these earbuds in my news feed and after reading the other customer reviews I decided to give them a chance.  Amazon shipping delivered them promptly and the very professional packaging impressed.  Inside the buds were very well packaged and included all the necessary charge cables and additional foam fittings for various ear sizes.  Four sizes in total and I settled on the second largest for best fit for sound quality and ability to stay seated during movement.  I am not planning to use these while exercising, running, biking, etc … just walking and doing chores around the property, and for this they fit and stayed seated really well.  Being very small I did not have high expectations for the sound quality as most are very thin and tinny sounding.  These earbuds have a substantial amount of bass an actually produce an overall balanced and nice sound for my preferred pop and rock music.  I cannot comment on volume as I have no intention of cranking up to max to see what they will do, but at a normal, comfortable level they are fantastic.  Final comments are on the charge/carry case.  Very well constructed with a great fit & finish... the bugs pair when removed and auto power off when placed back.  I'd like the case to be a bit smaller but it's a fine trade in exchange for the additional charges it carries.  Plus it's nicely rounded and smooth so slips into (large) pocket very easily.  All in all I'm delighted with this purchase!",5,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0
"Bought as a replacement since I lost one of my AirPods and didn’t feel like paying an arm for replacements or arm and leg for newer editions.Overall I love these sound is great, functionality buttons are useful for calls, came with variety of earbud replacement(I’m particular about how headphones and earbuds feel) and I love the charging case! The only draw back is battery life seems short, but that could be me I have a habit of staying connected when not using them.",5,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"The sound from these are great.  I love the deep base and clear tones.I've never had problems with the ear buds themselves running out of battery, but I've only used them for a couple of hours at any one time.  However, my charging case has had issues.  It seems to lose a charge even when it's idle and not charging the buds and then just recently it started being able to charge at all.  I have contacted the company and they are sending a replacement without any issues, which is wonderful.  I hope I just had a bad case and the new one both charges better and holds a charge as well.",4,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0
"These are ok. In the past couple of days of using them, I began to see some flaws in the design of the product. The product page says is Ip8, but at the bottom of the charging case, it says Ip68. But regardless of the Ip rating, it did well with sweat during my runs. The stock bud tips were ok, ended up switching them out for the MPow Flame ear tips cause the stock ones didn't feel all that secure in my ear while in use. One big gripe I have is that it does not automatically connect to my phone. I would literally have to go in the bt settings to connect to it ( I cleared out all of my bt connections to see if that would fix it, it didn't. Waste of time) and my phone is either in my hand or inner coat pocket. For $50, I would expect it to automatically connect.Pros - lightweight, stays in place, sound quality is good, good battery life.",2,1,2019-4-26,1,0,1
"I decided to try these out as my first foray into single earbuds. I really wanted to like them and picked these for the extra features of the Qi charging, waterproof status and decent case.It only took me a few days to realize this product was subpar. The sound was weak. I swapped out all the different ear bud pieces to find the right fit, nothing. My volume was maxed out on my phone (tried 3 different devices) to the same result. I normally am listening comfortably at 50% volume.",1,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"I like these earbuds so far. I have small ears, and they fit well. I ordered the white color - case is sleek. All parts and items arrived intact. The only issue I have is making phone calls, it's difficult for the mic to pick-up what I'm saying, and people on the other line have trouble hearing me. Also, I haven't mastered the simple buttons on these, so I have a tendency to leave them on and run the battery down because I can't figure it out yet.",3,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"I just got it in this week. Thus far, the sound quality is excellent. The multiple options for the earbuds helped me find what best fit me, and the waterproofing hold true as I've both worked out and showered with them on. The charging case is easy to use, and it came with a cord (no base, so you'll have to make do with whatever that means for you), and it's overall wonderful at the moment. Now comes the test of longevity, since I'm working out 5 days a week. We'll see if it can take a beating or not (as of 6/2/20)9/29/20 So about 3 months in, my right earbud no longer held charge or would charge on the charging dock. A bit frustrating, but these things happen. The people at Tozo replaced it within a couple of weeks and I have a new working set of ear buds! The quality of the product was great, and as long as this doesn't happen in the near future again, I very happily recommend this product. There was a slight language barrier when dealing with the Tozo customer service, but they were polite and prompt and professional.",5,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"I've owned other wireless earbuds and headsets in the past but these MORE than exceed the quality of any of them. Very nice build quality and packaging. Easy to set up and get going in about a minute!! I don't plan on swimming while using these but the waterproof feature is a definite plus.I find them very comfortable in my ears and the sound quality is exceptional. For the price, you can't go wrong with these!!",5,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
These really are the best earbuds I've ever owned! After you pair them to your phone the first time they automatically turn on and pair each time you remove them from the case. Several sizes of buds are sent with the package so you can match the right size to your ear. I love these! Inexpensive and very modern. I plan on buying another pair so I always have one in my gym bag and one next to my bed! Love them!,5,1,2019-4-23,1,1,0
"I bought these headphones a couple months ago and have used them nearly daily since I purchased them. I use them for working out and for my bike commute to work as well as any other leisure bike rides.The headphones fit in my ears very well and stay fairly snug. As other reviewers have mentioned, make sure to try the different earbud sizes for the best fit to minimize any chance of them falling out. I had mine start falling out once I would get a bit sweaty on the treadmill, however this issue was averted when I moved a size up. Sound quality is on point. I have never worn these headphones for longer than 1.5 hours each day, and usually wear them for a few days in a row and they stay charged up in the case before I have to recharge again. The noise cancellation is decent, but not really noticeable above what regular headphones provide. Regardless, that's not what I bought them for and I can hear my music clearly while wearing them, which is what I really care about.",5,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones because I needed an everyday pair to take to the gym and get sweaty.  Since these were waterproof, on lightning sale, and had good reviews I picked them up.  When I first tried them out I was impressed that they easily paired to my phone.  Some sets I've had in the past proved to be difficult.  Then the sound quality came in.  The treble is loud and clear but the bass us so so.  But to be expected for a $25 pair.  They are pretty good when it comes to noise canceling too.  I charge them after every use so I cant say for sure how long the battery lasts.  Overall they're a great pair of headphones for the price.  I'd buy them again.  Oh yeah, and they have an 18 month warranty!",5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"I must say, I love music. And I also prefer wireless charging . I purchased these ear buds earlier in the year.  I went everywhere with them. I unfortunately lost them so I decided to do some shopping and research.. and here i am again on my SECOND pair!  I always had an issue with headphones being uncomfortable or too big for my ears. These buds STAY PUT! I run in the city and have no issues at all. I am a frequent traveler and I must drown out the sounds of a plane just to relax somewhat. The charge is more than sufficient.  It charges quickly on my yootech 3-1 charger. I use them with all my devices. I highly recommend these. They are long lasting and the sound quality is amazing!",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"I love these earbuds! I have had them for about two months, and I've only had one problem with them. They are super noise canceling (which has been perfect for my college studies), but if I want to hear road traffic while I'm running or hear people around me, I have to take one of them out. When I take one out of my ear and set it somewhere or hold it in my hand, the music quality isn't as good. But that's probably just because the two earbuds need to be in range to stay connected to each other. Other than that, the sounds quality is great and super noise cancelling. They hold about a 3-3.5 hour battery usage and connect super well and fast. They come with several ear bud fitters so that you can fit them to your ears. Very pleased with these earbuds!",4,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
Update: December 2019Super happy with their customer service! I almost forgot that there is a 1 year warranty you sign up for when you purchase the earbuds so I reached out and let them know what was going with my charging case. They apologized for any inconvenience and said they would send me a Free replacement charging case immediately. Very happy with their fast response and customer service!,5,1,2019-2-14,1,0,1

"Was recommended by my roommate because it was time for me to upgrade to wireless earbuds and because I wasn’t willing to spend a lot. This is a win-win!!! Really great quality and great price!

"for the price, it's a pretty decent pair of wireless earbuds, but they're honestly kinda a pain! i've tried all the earbud sizes and none fit right; they always fall out in minutes or are in so tightly they're uncomfortable. recently, my left earbud has stopped connecting with the right ""master"" bud, or when it does connect it periodically disconnects. it's sorta hard to jam out when your earbuds are constantly going ""DISCONNECTED... CONNECTED. RIGHT CHANNEL. LEFT CHANNEL.""noise cancellation is ok, and the volume is pretty loud (though i honestly wish they could go quieter). there's not any features with the buttons on the sides of the headphones other than pause and play -- no skip function, volume adjustment, etc.. they're shaped very oddly, in a way which makes them very hard to adjust and, again, stay in properly.",2,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"This product has good and bad things about it. The first thing to note is that the sound quality is TERRIBLE. There is a  band of sound almost missing so that anything coming through sounds muted and weak. The build quality and battery life on these are actually pretty decent. No complaints there. They also have issues connecting to some devices. For example, when connected to my computer, they will drop the sound and then fade back in. It will do this constantly. However, it works perfectly fine on my phone.Overall, I would not purchase again and find an alternative.",2,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"Was able to connect them successfully the first time, but audio was not playing through these earbuds. It was playing though my desktop speaker instead. I double checked to see if it was properly connected, turns out there wasn't an option to play audio through the earbuds.

Great headphones! I’ve only had them for a day but they sure are good :) no need to pay outrageous prices for Bluetooth earbuds. I like the TOZO brand and they haven’t let me down with customer service either. Always quick to respond. I hope these are better than another brand I had that stopped working after a few months use.

Well I normally don't write reviews but I could not stop writing review for T10. I just got T10 today along with an other earbud. Clearly I can distinguish the sound quality between those two. Infact T10 is much clearer and sharper than my iPhone wired earphones. I can also connect to my Firestick and sound quality is awesome.Pros:,4,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
"My kids purchased two other brands and they worked ok.  A pain in the neck trying to get the two ear buds to link.I purchased these Tozo T10 for myself and I am very glad I did. They were not much more money since headphones are cheap.  But the setup was all automated and the sounds is great.  I had surgery on one of my ears so I was afraid these would not work.  But with the many ear pieces they supply, one of the sizes worked.",5,1,2019-4-29,1,0,0
"I’ve been looking for a good set of earphones for me to be able to workout in without them getting in the way. So far I can not recommend these enough, especially for the price point! For reference I do mostly weight training and I boulder. While I weight trained they stayed in place. I’m glad they provided extra sizes for the ears. The sound quality is also exceptional! For the price, it is loud and has a good enough bass. I’ve worn these around the house and are also really good at noise cancelling. Will try to provide more updates as time goes on.Update: (07/15/2020) I don’t reach for these anymore. Idk what happened but these would not stay in my ear when I would run.",4,1,2019-9-15,1,0,0
"At first I was very happy with this purchase. I wear for my job in which wearing my previous earbuds plugged into my phone I would get caught on things. I have had people tell me that they can't hear me so doesn't seem they are truly noise cancelling, maybe just on my end. I purchased these in May and last week the right earbud started acting up. I'm sure we all experience an earbud going out; if you're on a call or listening to music the sound comes and goes. Now today, the left earbud volume is low and I had my phone on high. Overall they lasted 3.5 months, not worth the price. Very disappointing.",2,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0

I was very impressed with the sounds quality. The presentation — the case itself and the style of the earbuds — is very modern and sleek, and I was very impressed with this as well.However, what I was really impressed with is the IPX8 rating. I am a college student who attends a school with very hostile weather, but I had no problem connecting them to each other and listening to them in rain, snow, and even a couple times in a snow blizzard :).

"Bought these as a Christmas present and have enjoyed them all year. Works great with both iPhone and laptop.  Made sure to register them after purchasing as the paperwork stated. After 10 months, the usb charging port did break off just a little bit on the very end. These things happen and I understand that. Contacted the customer service via email and received a fast response and resolution (within a couple days and emails). Not a long, drawn out process like you get sometimes. They offered to ship out a brand new charging base at no cost and I didn’t have to take the extra time  or have the expense of shipping the old one back. That is GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE to me!

"I am an active person that goes to the gym a lot. After snagging and breaking two of my wired earphones within the same year I made the decision to try out wireless earphones. I browsed Amazon and purchased the TOZO T10 5.0 wireless earbuds after reading the reviews.The sound quality is great. The extra bass makes itself known without muddying the balance. The product is light and easy to store. It may feel like the earbuds will fall out easily with the first few initial usage. However, you will soon realize they can be snug fit if you adjust the wearing angles. You can also switch the size of the bud tips for better fitting. The amount of play time I have been getting after a full charge has been constant at around 3 - 3.5 hours. Hopefully the battery life will not decrease anytime soon.",5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
The built in microphone is a disaster. People could barely hear me when I used them for calls and I actually had to take out and hold one of the pieces closer to my mouth in order to be heard at all. As other people mentioned in some of the reviews the connection between the speakers is really bad. After some use the left piece goes into an annoying cycle of disconnecting-reconnecting especially when you move your head and you have to keep resetting them in order to fix that. Whether I got a defective one or all of their products are like this I don’t know. But it seems like it’s a common issue so I’m not going to replace it and hope that the new one I get will be different. Sound quality is good and battery life is okay hence the two stars but I wouldn’t recommend this product. I wish they didn’t put that useless microphone in there and focused more on the connection strength and overall quality.,2,1,2019-2-20,1,1,0
These buds would not stay in my ears even after switching out the cushions. They immediately popped out. The sound quality was good and I would have been satisfied with them if they fit. They fit perfect in my husbands ears. I had to return them.Update:,4,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"I wanted to like these wireless earbuds, but they're not great. You get way you pay for. The sound quality is fairly poor IMO - it's staticky and not clear or crisp. I also don't care for the controls - I always have issues with connecting both of the earbuds and that can lead to me accidentally hanging up while on calls. They are fairly comfortable with a nice battery life though.",2,1,2020-9-29,1,0,0
Not really big on using wifi for headphones but saw good reviews so figured I try it. At first they feel as of good quality and heavy. Easy to pair to my galaxy note 9. They stay in my ears pretty good although I'm not working out just use in my office or to cut the grass. The big downside is that while you are moving they cut off the music very frequently. Now if I'm in bed not moving they seem to be ok. Overall I wouldn't recommend for gym usage. Might give them to my 7 year old daughter and myself a better brand.,2,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"I bought 3 headphones, black, blue and gold, I'm very impressed with the quality, sound also is very helpful for me when I receive phone calls.

I would like better battery life for these buds but they make up for it in other areas. The Tozo T10 outperformed everything I put it against in my everyday commute and workplaces. I would strongly recommend this as a tech gift this holiday season",4,1,2019-11-25,1,1,1
"At first I was a bit skeptical buying headphones like these, because just dropping one side of it and losing it was a fear of mine, and would certainly warrant a lot of ""F's"" in the chat.After getting these though, the sound quality, how comfortable it fits in my ears, and the battery life on the headphones themselves, and then there's the price: I'm just gonna say that these are worth the purchase, and I have a feeling these will last me quite a while. I've also gathered (from reading other reviews) that the customer reviews are pretty solid in their own right, so that took care of my earlier concern.",5,1,2019-1-29,1,2,0
"I've been very impressed with this set of wireless earbuds. The audio has been exceptional with all the music and audiobooks I've used them with. I was a bit worried that the shape would be uncomfortable over time, but I've quickly forgotten they're even there most of the time. They paired with my Pixel 2 right away, and with one another without any problems. The magnetic snap-in charger box is very cool. The earbuds click into place and hold firmly, and start charging right away. The box itself has blue LED indicators to show how much charge is left in the internal battery, so it's easy to see when it's running low. One feature I didn't notice when I bought them was the wireless induction charger in the bottom of the case. If you have wireless chargers already, you can just set this case on them to recharge the internal battery rather than use the included USB cable. It's a very convenient feature to have! Overall, I've had a great experience with these, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to others.",5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"I chose these because of the price point and all the reviews from people with small ear canals saying they stayed in their ears no problem. That was not my experience. I could just be sitting and they would fall out. I tried all the different sizes to find the right fit, but none of them worked. They also hurt my ears after a short time of wearing. The sound quality is not the best, so don't try to listen to anything with a lot of bass. Pros about these buds where the wireless charging and a long battery life.",3,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"These have great sounds and awesome fit, but when they say 3 hours on a charge, they mean it! I need two pair... One for the morning and one for the afternoon while the first pair charges.

So i have had these buds for almost a year now.  and there are some definite Cons to them and good Pros.Pros:  They do cancel out the noise very well.  They sit snugly in the ear and aren't to heavy at all.  I really like using just one and leaving the other one out so i can still hear around me.,2,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
"When the earbuds work, they're great. WHEN they work though.  In my home, when it's just me, never had a problem. At the gym though, it was constantly dropping.  It wasn't a distance issue. My phone could be in my pocket, or I could be actively on it with it 12"" in front of my face and it was still dropping. I re-paired, turned off/on bluetooth, reset my network connections, restarted the phone, and cleared a cache from the boot menu. Everything short of factory resetting my phone and the issue persisted. The pair I am replacing stopped charging, but I never once had connectivity problems. If you never are gonna be around other bluetooth devices, give em a shot. If you plan on using them in a bluetooth device dense environment, save your money, they aren't worth itI was also offered a free wireless charger if I gave them a good review. Makes me wonder how many 5 star reviews are charging their earbuds with a free charger",1,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"I have had these ear buds for 6 months now.  From the beginning they often disconnect from my cell phone (Android) bluetooth and then reconnect.  They would be pretty good value if they solved that. But now I have to get a new pair of ear buds.  Cannot have that?You are only as good as the customer service provided after you purchased a product.  So many don't get that.  After post the above review and two stars I was contacted by Tozo customer service.  I did not contact them... they contacted me unsolicited.  Their first contact with me was an offer to replace the item at no cost.  Did I say they contacted me!!  Stuff happens and when a vendor steps up after a purchase.... you have to give them a five, right.  Thanks Tozo, nice to see.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0

Great quality and was ready to go right out of the box. Plenty of options to make sure you get a perfect fit. Just feels like quality when you hold them. The case has a certain heaviness to it that feels expensive. I’ve used cheap wireless ear buds and the cases are always light and flimsy. I’m really quite happy with these!

"So far, so good. I just received them. I tried all of the sizes of the rubber ear tips but stills feels like they are going to fall out. I got these because the sport ear buds I have with the Bluetooth wire that drapes around your neck people said they couldn't hear me or it was muffled.

He often watches a different program on his computer while I'm in the same room watching TV.

"I purchased these wireless earbuds for my son for Christmas and he loves them. I own a pair of Apple air pods and was curious about the sound quality comparison, so I tried these ear buds and could tell little to no difference is sound quality. Now I’m kind of mad I paid $200 for Apple’s that don’t stay in my ear, when these are just as good. Considering purchasing a pair for myself anyway. Great job ToZo. I ordered them at the last minute and they got here still before Christmas which is a plus. The battery life is great and it supports wireless charging. JUST LIKE THE $200 AirPod 2.

"Got these for just $20 on Black Friday and how could you beat that deal. Did a lot of research before buying these and I’ve been happy so far until recently. I use them on average of 6 to 8 hours a day and recharge the case daily or every other day but sadly the earbuds and case aren’t lasting as long as they used to, battery wise. Only having these for 4 months it’s disappointing I am in the market for more headphones. Either will try a more expensive pair or just buy these again. Either way, battery life aside I am more than satisfied!",4,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0

"I got these headphones because the last ones I had were wired and kept falling to one side so I had to keep pulling them back in place and they got shorted out.

They don't always connect automatically to my phone which I wish they did, but it's a small problem that can be easily overlooked. Overall, I'm happy so far but I've only had them for about 3 days.",4,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"If all you are doing is listening to stuff, these aren’t bad. The sound is a little tinny. The microphone makes it sound like you are far away, and not all that clear.

"Great wireless earbuds for the money. They magnetically attach to the case to charge, which can in turn wirelessly charge or charge through the microusb port. Sound quality is quite good, I think it's as good or better than airpods, while this is 1/3 the price. Airpods technically have more battery life, but I never listen to music long enough for these to run out of power anyway, and they get over 10 hours or something when you're putting them back in the charging case every few hours or so. Comfortable in the ear, just gently twist to get a good seal. Depending on the size of your ear you may need to change out the ear tips (multiple sizes are included). Just connect to the right earbud and it will automatically connect to the left. Thanks, for reading, I've enjoyed these earbuds and would recommend them!",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,1
I was worried when buying these since just because something is popular doesn't mean it's good but to my surprise I love these. The pairing process is super easy and they connect before I can even get them both in my ears so I'm not sure how people are having issues with them not connecting or only having one connect. The case has a very satisfying magnetic lid that is just translucent enough to see the charging LEDs for both the case and the ear buds themselves. The sound is awesome I love heavy bass and these have just as much bass as my much much more expensive German Beyerdynamic wired headphones I have for my PC which surprised the heck out of me. Overall these are awesome and I would recommend them to anyone.,5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
These buds are great. perfect pairing every time of the case and sound quality is beyond what id expect / most people would deem amazing.

"Iphone user. Wanted to buy AirPods, but did not want to pay their outrageous price. Saw this deal on amazon and decided to try it out. Sounds quality is great when listening to music! However when you make phone calls, the other person says it picks up a lot of background noise. To me it sounds great, but bothers the other party. Battery life is good (don't know how many hours). I haven't tried it while exercising, but I am sure while listening to music it is great. Overall, if you don't want to spend a ton of money on AirPods and want something for everyday without braking your wallet-this IS the thing for you!",5,1,2019-2-13,1,0,0
For a while I had resigned myself that i could't get great sound from earbuds but now I am totally impressed by the deep bass and clear highs. I had almost forgot the great sound I heard from my music collection until I got these earbuds. I could swear the bass is near sub-woofer levels and that is while jogging in the city. The noise cancellation blocks out most sound but still being able to hear sounds that you need to hear like fire engines. Just the perfect amount for me.I am impressed by the battery life because I listen rather loudly and thought it would drain the battery too much but it has no effect on the battery life. I love the charging case!,5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"A couple of weeks back the left pod failed to connect, my teen son did not tell me right away, it was his Christmas gift.  Then I found out he didn't register the product.

Jamie wrote back right away, free replacement on the way, they don't want the failed pod back.  Just flat out real customer service!  There is a lot of good and bad coming out of PRC.

They are comfortable, the sound is great, and they block out all of the gym noises; even the really loud grunters!

I listen to these almost the entire work day (6-8 hours) and have no issues with them falling out or disconnecting. Sound quality is fantastic.

"The overall of the product is great but there are minor things I think they could improve. First of all, it would be nice if you can decrease or increase the volume by pressing the earbuds... But that is not possible. They set the product to do the same things in both right and left earbuds so that limits the possibilities of what you do by double clicking or triple clicking them. Besides that the sound is amazing, they are very conformable, not too big, they pair easily and fast, the changing box is solid and good quality, you can charge the product many times without charging the box aaaanndd something I really really liked was that you can charge the box wireless too... So overall the product is great it just that I would like to be able, in some way, to change the volume by pressing the earbud.",4,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"I got these to replace a set of bluetooth earphones (with the left and right buds connected by a wire) to use for workouts, conference calls, and listening to audiobooks / music while walking outdoors.  These earphones failed at delivering even decent quality on all 3.  The left and right earbuds frequently go out of phase, so there's a micro-delay between the L and R channels.  If that's not bad enough, if you're in a crowded gym, outside with your iPod / iPhone in your pocket, or ANY situation other than ""empty room with your paired device 3 inches away from the earbuds and no obstruction between the 2,"" there are frequent gaps in the audio. This proved true on multiple devices, with a full battery charge, and basically every other situation I can imagine.  Don't buy these, they're not worth it.",1,1,2019-8-29,1,1,0
Earphones are excellent. Sound great and they are also comfortable to wear. I paired mine with my Samsung tv because I do not hear well and I was amazed how much better a movie was to watch. I heard sounds I usually never hear and made the movie experience superb. I also used them to listen to music on my phone and was really happy with the sound quality. They are also excellent for taking phone calls. These are a must buy if your looking for a great pair of bluetooth headphones without breaking the bank. I would highly recommend these to anyone. In fact I orderd another pair since they paired easily with my TV and other devices.The only complaint I had was I ordered grey and got sent beige.This was a quick fix after I contacted Amazon customer service. I have the correct color on the way now. I rate Amazon customer service as excellent.,5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"Even though this product had good reviews, I'm not happy with them.  When working properly, which is only about 50% of the time, the sound quality is very good.  The problem is that they cut out, switch back and forth between left and right, and go into an echo mode randomly.  They've completely dropped out in the middle of calls several times so I can't count on using them at all for important virtual meetings.  And battery life I haven't found to be anywhere near what is claimed.My opinion is that you should buy something else.  These aren't worth the money.",2,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0

So I’ve had these for quite some time. They have been used a lot and sound great.  Just recently I left them on my night stand out of the charger and  a few days later I was going for a run and thought they would be drained. I popped them in and had no problem going for a 45 min run With plenty of juice to spare. The music sounds great with nice of bottom end. I’ve been a recording engineer for 35 years and these are plenty good for me. At this price point you can’t go wrong.,5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
I bought a pair(black) about 9months ago and was blown away! The sound was excellent! The pairing was a breeze! But sadly I lost the left earbud. I rocked just the right one for about 4 months and finally I needed the left ear and broke down to buy another pair(khaki/rose gold).

"I have had the earbuds for roughly 3 months and they were great for working out, work around the house, and listening to videos. However, there were three really big downsides: Bluetooth quality, lifespan, false garuntee. I first noticed the Bluetooth connection to my phone was spotty whenever I would go out for a run. It seemed that the connection would not hold while on the move and my left earbud would stop playing audio at random points as I ran. Walking, however, did not affect the connection. Not being able to use these on a run was a large upset. Second, after the three months of use, my right earbud died. Not in the sense that the battery ran out, but that it would play sound at an almost inaudible level. Now, the right earbud has ceased playing any audio at all, yet I can still connect it to the left bud and connect it to my phone. So, I decided to cash in on the free ""1-Year extended warranty"" that comes in the package with the product. Just filling out the information for the warranty was tedious and suspicious as it was not specific at all towards who bought what product, and thus, I have been denied any for of re-imbursement or replacement. The T10s were great for those three months, but I would not recommend if you are not looking to repetitively buy earbuds every three months!",2,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
"I left my Airpods in Houston after a business trip; which was a good thing because the sound quality was poor and they had zero noise cancelling capabilities. I bought the Tozo 10's on a whim to replace them, and could not be more satisfied for the price. They fit well and don't fall out. The bass and sound quality is satisfactory, and they look about as good as you could ask for. The most surprising thing I found is that they really are waterproof. I work out in the pool a lot, and I gave them the full test in the pool yesterday. Water was splashing on them and it didn't effect them at all. The ear buds keep almost all of the water out of your ear, so the sound never really gets distorted. I even wore them beneath the water, and they still held true. However, the sound cuts out when you go under water because the Bluetooth signal cannot traverse a liquid environment. Whenever I surfaced, the music would go right back to playing. The signal distance is satisfactory as well. For example, I wrapped my phone up in a towel and put it in the center of my 25 meter long lane, and I received minimal cut outs in sound. Would, and already have, recommend this to anyone trying to get decent/good quality wireless headphones.",4,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
Was very surprised at the sound quality. Definitely topped my view on it compared to the Beats earbuds and regular iPhone headphones. The ear buds and charging case lasted 2-3 weeks with out being charged. I guess it was cause the use of me using them was minimal but def was nothing what I expected. Exceeded my expectation. The one thing I don't like that it sometimes slips out your ear if it isn't snugged securely or properly but other than I love that the ear bud covers were able to help with that by changing the sizes it came it with.,5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"Thanks for the Bluetooth 5.0 technology in the budget earbuds by TOZO. The range is great and the battery life if really really good. The microphone reception is also very good that the other person on call didn't find hard time hearing me. One thing they can improve is the noise cancelling part, but, trust me, this is far better than any other budget earbuds at this price. Once more thing is that, not all ears are the same, but, try all the ear caps provided in the box before you complain about the problem of fitting in the ears. I did the same thing and with the advice of the customer service, I tried the rest and got the one which fits for my ears.",5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0

I used them one time in a very light rain that came about during my daughter's soccer game and now left bud does not work.

"Edit:  After using a few times, I am happy with the quality of sound.  There are a few glitches that happen though.  If the source of music is not very near the master earbud, ie the right side, it will cut out at times.  It doesn't cut out for long, but is annoying.  I moved my phone from my left front pocket to my right front pocket and this seemed to disappear.The left earbud will cut out after about an hours worth of use.  Don't know if the battery is getting low to the point where it will periodically disconnect from the right, again, is just a moment lost, but also annoying.  Other than that, I have no real complaints.",4,1,2019-3-6,1,0,0
"Even with the smallest ear piece, they didn't fit right in my ears and fell out. If I went any bigger, they hurt.

UPDATE: the range is awful. I can’t walk into the next room without it cutting out. The fact that you can’t use the left by itself is a bummer but the range is why I will return it. They also have you leave a review to register the warranty with the promise of a possible free accessory which would encourage many people to leave a high review on a brand new purchase that they haven’t tried.So far so good.

"Good sound quality, but otherwise, really hard to deal with. The bluetooth signal gets attenuated completely if it has to pass through your body at all - I cant listen to music if my phone is in my left pocket. Also, the pairing is a pain in the rear. The left and right earbuds can become unpaired from each other, meaning I not only have to pair them to my phone, I have to experiment with the dumb one-button pairing feature until the pods pair with each other, then, if I'm really lucky, with my smartphone. Review to follow up in ~3 months if these stop working like every other set of ""Amazon Choice"" bluetooth headphones I've bought...",2,1,2019-7-14,1,0,0
"I wanted some easy to use wireless earbuds for when I exercise - either in the gym or on a bike ride outdoors. I have worn them twice and I have to say I am pretty pleased.  They paired with my Motorola X4 phone right away.  I have had used them twice so far. First, I charged them on the previous night.  The next morning, I noticed that they seemed to be having some very short connectivity gaps when the microwave was on.  It was an odd coincidence, but it happened.  Then, I wore them to my gym and I was doing various exercises.  I am not sure why, but it seemed like at times the right earbud was momentarily losing contact with the left earbud as i tilted/crunched my way through the exercises.  It wasn't bad, but I was not expecting that.  My expectation was that these earbuds are only 6 to 8 inches apart between my ears so why would there be any problem? This morning, I wore them on a bike ride and I experienced no issues whatsoever.  On both occasions, I was also wearing my Fitbit Inspire HR tracker so there were at least two Bluetooth connections to my phone. I'm not sure if that matters.I am going to continue using these for the next few days and will monitor the performance.  However, if these don't stop working and continue giving me a good experience, then I will feel it was well worth it.",5,1,2019-9-21,1,0,0
"You only get about three hours of listening time before you have to charge these again. Probably not a big deal for some but I use music to improve my daily focus in the office. All in all, these are nice to use on the weekends when gardening outdoors. I don’t end up snagging a wire and pulling out of my ears when wiping off sweat. And the water resistance is a nice quality as I tend to have neighbors who stop to talk while I garden, meaning dirt gets transferred to the surface and I have to rinse off constantly.",3,1,2019-6-11,1,0,0
"I've had these earbuds for about two months and have really liked this product. They were very easy to set up/use the first time. The sound quality is good, as is the battery life. They don't cancel out all other noises (if someone calls my name/knocks on a nearby door, I still hear that), but they do cut down on background noise, making it easier to focus and listen to an audiobook or what I'm listening to - that's perfect for my needs.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"I bought these for my boyfriend who does lawn care as a side business. He needed something that he could still hear his music while using the mower, weed eater, etc.  These fit the bill! The ability to change out the ear ""bud"" is what really sold us on purchasing these. He says that the sound is great and I can attest that I can hear him CLEARLY while he's speaking through them on his phone, even when hes using lawn equipment. Definitely recommend!",5,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0
"So I was looking at Apple Air Pods and I just couldn’t bring myself to spend that much on arpods after looking at the reviews. I found a ranking of best ear buds, which these were at the top of and figured I would give them a shot. Color me surprised when they worked and sounded much better than I anticipated. Very each setup and quality packaging. Comes with different sized ear inserts so you can pick the ones that fit the best which was also really helpful because I have small ear canals. I will recommend these to anyone who asks and absolutely recommend them to whoever is reading this.",5,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"Good sound quality for music/voice. My husband said he could hear me fine talking to him on the phone (and he is somewhat hard of hearing). For the price, I was really impressed with the musical quality. I use them when exercising. I'm having trouble keeping the right one seated in my ear, so I may need to put a smaller rubber ear bud on it, but the left starts comfortable in place. I haven't used them over a long period, so I can't speak to battery life yet. They paired easily with my Note 8. I would recommend them.",5,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0
"Buds would not stay in my ears, kept falling out with just walking around. I tried different size ear pieces but still no good. I belive what I received was a used not new set of earbuds and had missing pieces. The sound quality was not that good in my opinion. Maybe I just got a faulty set but I did not like them so ended up returning which I don't do that often.",1,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"I've purchased over a dozen different wireless headsets, headphones, buds over the years. None gave me issues like these. I used them about 7 times before the left earbud started to cut out every 30 seconds or so. It would reacquire the signal but then cut out again.I tried to just use them as is and for music it was annoying but serviceable. For podcasts/audiobooks, it wasn't even worth it.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"Originally bought these so I wouldn't have to put the phone to my head, but everyone I've talked to says they can't hear me, or it sounds like I'm in a well. For this reason I have to knock off 2 stars, as 50 percent of what I was expecting to work decently is not.So now I just default to them as strictly a listening device, which the quality is great.",3,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"I like these headphones, but I don’t love them. I initially got these headphones on black Friday and waited a few months to leave a review. I primarily use these headphones when I workout so I don’t have to worry about wires.What I like about these headphones is they sound great. They aren’t expensive and they’re great quality for what you pay for.",4,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"I cannot use those Apple wireless pods....my ears are small and they stink.  This set comes with a variety of earbud sizes, which was nice...EXCEPT....mine were missing one of the extra large sizes and the one extra large was defective.  Not an issue with me as I cannot use that size anyway.  Aside from the missing part, these are my newest favorite purchase.  Bonus!!!......they are waterproof.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"I liked this product, but with once or twice a week use, the left earbuds stopped syncing with the right. I worked with Amazon product support after failing to fix it with Tozo troubleshooting processes; Amazon sent me the replacement.Now here’s a catch. The product offers 18 month warranty if you register the product within 14 days. Their website does not exist anymore. They do not list phone numbers either. So I wonder, what does it mean? Their support or warranty does not exist anymore. Although I liked the product, I won’t recommend purchasing it with high probability of failing (lots of same problems on web) and their lack of support.",1,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"The good - super efficient so they play plenty loud.  Sound quality is pretty good - lots of bass, but a little tubby.The bad - bluetooth.  At the house I could only move 5-6 feet from my phone before they would lose connection.  At the gym they wouldn't stay connected at all.  In my shirt or shorts pocket or even laying on the treadmill they stuttered constantly.  I don't know if I got a bad set or not since there are so many positive reviews,  but that is completely unacceptable.",1,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"I used to have a AKG N60nc headphones before the headset broke, I got tired of the headset style as I have a large head. Best sound quality I have ever had, until now. Never thought I would wear another pair of headphones with such great quality. These headphones have a bit more bass and the sound quality is equal. Took me 10 seconds to set them up and pair them to my phone. Highly recommend.",5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
"These are some pretty solid earbuds for the cost. As with most earbuds, they're pretty good at cancelling sound; and that sound, the quality of it, is pretty great. I'm no audiophile but I enjoyed just about every little part of the noise coming into my ears. I don't believe anything was enhanced at the cost of another; every instrument got in the spotlight with these.Also, extremely portable too. Fantastically portable. Tiny little box, no bigger than a cigarette box (smaller). Easily fit in a coat pocket or any pocket really. Magnets in the earbuds make attaching them to charge a quick ordeal, and the lid is magnetically closed too. Very durable.",3,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
Very poor battery life 3 .5 hours maybe.  Very happy with sound quality and volume. Blue tooth range is not that good. They cut out with phone in back pocket. Too easy to dial phone when just tapping earpiece. Storage case charges ear pieces 2 times so you can get about 9 to 10 hours out of earpieces if fullly charged along with case.  Will try other manufacturer for next time. Worth the price but maybe its time for me to up my budget. :),4,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
"You will love everything about this product, it comes with multiple earbud sizes for all types of ears, a charging dock that can charge up other devices and an amazing sound system. I usually don’t care for most material things but this product has impacted my life so substantially that I had to do a review. I can sync one earbud to one device and sync the other to another phone simultaneously and it allows me to get more things done in a quicker amount of time. For only $50, this is the best product you can buy by far from any others, thank you!!",5,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0
"The fact that I was willing to buy a second pair of these headphones is both an endorsement as well as a criticism of the product.The positives are that these are comfortable, good sounding headphones at an affordable price that work as well for phone calls as it does for music or videos.",4,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"I was somewhat despondent after our puppy chewed my Bose ear buds into a very mangled and unusable versions of their former selves. Since purchasing another pair would be fiscally irresponsible at this stage, I decided to give the TOZO T10s a shot. Figured there was not much to lose at the price.I will admit to initially being quite impressed with the overall presentation and packaging upon receipt; however, packaging doesn't mean much if the product doesn't deliver. Well, it delivered for me. The one step setup and pairing could not have been easier. Both wired and wireless charging is quick and works well. Battery life is consistently right at 4 hours with my usage. As for the fit, I feel extremely lucky that the T10s fit perfectly for me right out of the box, but it is good to have three other tip options just in case. In fact, I have been in the gym with them and have not felt the need to stop and adjust them as I move around. For my amateur, untrained ear, the sound quality and call quality are well beyond my expectations with noise cancelling and waterproof being nice bonuses.",1,1,2019-8-3,1,0,0
"Extremely impressed with Tozo T10  purchase. Amazing packaging with quality build material, magnificent features at an economy price.Pairing with my phone(iphone 11 pro /iphone 8) was too easy. Excellent sound clarity and the richness of the bass are of the quality with perfect noise cancellation. Remember Right ear bud is the primary. Wireless charging is quite handy all the time. Pick from the charging box and put in your ear; all set to rock with your music.",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,1
"Great product for the price - the multiple size ear buds are a definite bonus / sound quality is very good - easy to use - stays in ears very well- long charge life - only one recommendation  ,  for the very few times that the buds have come loose from the ears a thin cord that is attached to both buds would be a plus  - just a safety precaution- I would by these again & recommend !",5,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
"UPDATE: The company has mentioned sending me replacement ear buds.  Hopefully the new ones will be better.  Original: I can't stress how out of the box broken these were.  Maybe I got a bad pair of buds but these DO NOT stream clear audio.  Here's the problem, when connected I start up my music and the right bud will usually work but the left ear bud will constantly cut in and out and sometimes not play anything at all.  If I even move my phone slightly they will cut out.  I can even sit still and it will have connectivity issues.  I think through a 1 hour workout session I can get consistent clear audio for maybe five minutes but the other 55 minutes I am listening to snippets of audio.  I have tried different apps, a different phone, and literally not trying to move at all which defeats the purpose of these earbuds but they will constantly produce jittery audio.  I've tried turning them on and off in different sequences and ensured that they were fully charged.  It doesn't matter if the phone is in my pocket or on my arm or right next to the earbuds on the table, they still cut out.  I'd really like a replacement if this isn't normal behavior but I tried to give it the old college try with these.",2,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
"Just purchased these a week ago and i have to admit, these might be the lowest sounding wireless earbuds i have ever purchased.  With my volume at max, the sound might only reach half the volume of say my bluephonic, focuspower or smartomi earbuds.  Such is disappointing because I do like the look of these and the case that it came with is pretty cool since it can charge the buds up to 4 times.Edit: Increasing my rating,  Customer service was actively trying to work with me and replace item as well as provide additional support products.  Because of that i have increased the rating.",5,1,2019-7-11,1,0,0
"I love the sound quality. Clear, no static and loud enough to cancel out other noises. The khaki color is cute. The case looks nice. I haven't seen how long it can last when fully charged cause I just got it but I think it will do good. I will come back and review that. I like the fact that it is waterproof. I haven't tried that as well, again will come back with my review on that...Update: it does work well in the shower. I even dropped it in the shower and its fine. I havent went swimming with it as it's been winter.",4,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0

The commands are also really annoying.",1,1,2020-5-25,1,1,0

These are truly wireless, great sounding earbuds for a beautiful price point.My only comment is that they're not waterproof... Just water resistant. Major difference there. That and the battery life isn't great unlike the JLabs Air Wireless Earbuds, but to have the charge box include qi charging, makes up for it.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"I have been using these earbuds for months and they are amazing! First of all, the price is affordable compared to top sellers like airpods and in my opinion they have about the same quality and are more comfortable. I can easily connect them using bluetooth to multiple devices such as my phone and laptop. The sound is great especially when hearing music and not having to worry about a wire or accidentally pulling them out. The case is also great because it acts as a portable charger. The battery life is decent and works for my purposes as a student who loves music. One problem is that sometimes the connection between the earbuds and my phone can be disrupted when walking or running but it doesn't happen often enough to be a big problem. Overall, I greatly recommend these earbuds because of their price, sound quality and comfort!",5,1,2020-9-15,1,0,1
Great. Last me the entire workout. Accidentally dropped them in the sink with water but they survived.They do tend to pop out every once in a while.,5,1,2019-4-25,1,1,0
"These produce much better sound than I was hoping. I like a deep, rich bass and crisp highs. I'm not a huge fan of mids for most of the music I listen to - when I use an equalizer looks like a ""V"" for most things. These really deliver that for me and I'm really pleased. I was hoping the battery life would be better. I sculpt stone and my last set of ""connected wireless"" BT headphones would run all day (6-8hrs). These last about 3hrs. I'm not a huge fan of how they fit in your ears, but my ears are wonky. They come with 4 prs of different sized nubs and the standard size fits in my left ear well and feels stable. I've tried all of the other sized nubs for my rt and none of them feel super stable unless I really jam into my ear canal (not so fun). It's still pretty stable and as long as I'm not dancing around too much righty stays in - it just doesn't FEEL stable and that's a little distracting. I wish they made attachments that would wedge against the cymba of the ear - I think that would warrant 5 stars regardless of the batt life.",4,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
"My first truly wireless ear buds. I have small earholes so thankful for the interchangeable four sizes of ear caps. The small fit snugly. They arrived charged which was nice. The case is solid, the buds snap in and are held securely with a strong magnet.I purchased them because I listen to a lot of broadcasts so they're not really for music. I did play some music. They have a soft slightly muffled sound with lots of beat. Not the tiny sound you usually get with cheap headphones. For the price they are an unbelievable product!",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"I ordered this product and received it next day (with Prime).  The packaging was excellent, and the product exactly as described and illustrated.

In short, I would definitely recommend this product and more importantly, this seller, to anyone.

An excellent purchase and experience!",5,1,2019-1-14,1,0,0
"The Tozo T10 wireless-Bluetooth earbuds are wonderful. They paired with my iPhone with no problem. The sound quality is surprisingly good; deep bass and the treble is not... tinny. Mostly, though, they are so comfortable. The 'buds come with 4 different-sized cushions to insure the perfect fit. Unlike those 'other' white, plastic earbuds that cost $250.00, these fit my ear wonderfully, and stay in! And... they're waterproof!! What more could a consumer ask for?Thank you, Tozo",5,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"I've had these for a couple weeks now and am very happy with the purchase. I can't speak to the longevity yet, but everything else has been great. The sound quality of these earbuds competes quite well against other more expensive earbuds I have used (airpods, JBL). The noise cancellation is great and they fit in-ear quite comfortably. Comes with different sized tips to find that right fit for you. The carrying case is compact and provides 4 charges for your buds before needing to be plugged into the charger again.Overall I couldn't be happier with these. What you are getting for this price point can't be argued with. If you are an intense audiophile than I am sure you will find something to criticize, but then again you probably aren't using earbuds all that much either. For everyone else, I would highly recommend them. Easy to use, great sound, great fit, and great price.",5,1,2019-4-2,1,1,0
"These earbuds are really good and I can recommend them if you just want something for a bit of music listening when you're out and about or at home.However the battery life is only about 3 hours long so any extended usage is going to be interrupted constantly, and the portable charger is nice but it only holds about 2 or 3 extra full charges. On the upside it only takes about 30 minutes to charge the earbuds back to full.",3,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0

I did not bother to experiment with fit and simply used the ear caps that were already on it, will save other sizes as backups. Charging case is compact, sturdy and well made - closes and stays closed via strong magnet.Pro tip: Left channel is a slave earbud and will appear on screen as not to pair (see pic) - don’t choose it! Put them on and listen, devices are quite intuitive and automatic. If it doesn’t work, just start over and repair!! No need to overthink, instructions are also pretty straightforward.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,1

They sound great. They have killer bass. They cancel noise really well. All and all I'm pretty impressed but the battery doesn't last but a cpl hours on the ear buds and you only get a cpl charges out of the case. I've had them about a week. All the sudden the left ear bud is cutting in and out occasionally. I can only assume it will get worse as time goes on. Also the mic works well.

"Super impressed with these for the price. I will say they were a bit tinny but I changed the equalizer setting on my iPhone to Treble Reducing and then they were perfection. Noise cancellation is pretty good, especially if you get a good fit from the four different sized cushions offered. The instructions are in broken English and offer a one year “hassle warranty” but the case magnetically holds the ear buds and also magnetically closes, so honestly this was just a great purchase.",4,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0

I use them mostly at work, during my lunch hour, and the other ladies I work with are louuuuud when they come into the break room too.

They are super easy to pair with devices and very simple to use.  They ship super fast as well and seam to be very durable.  TOZO Customer Service is very responsive and very helpful.  I did have a charging issue with one headphone after a few months, and they sent me very detailed help information to help.  When that did not work to fix the charge issue they immediately responded to send me a new set for free.  Bottom line an excellent experience and great sound for such a low price.

"I had a different pair of Bluetooth headphones I loved that I accidentally ran over with my car (sad, sad day). So I was unexpectedly in the market for new ones as the company I had purchased from didn't make the headphones I ruined any longer. After significant research and reading reviews I decided to go with the TOZO T10 5.0 Wireless Earbuds based on over 5,000 reviews that were mostly positive. Turns out I made the right decision, and here's why: 1. These cancel out ambient noise better than any pair of non-custom headphones I've ever owned (I do own a pair of Alcair in-ear monitors custom fit and they are the only things that seal better than the TOZO). This means when I am mowing the yard, edging, or on a run near a busy street I can hear the podcast to which I am listening without an issue. 2. The low end in these headphones is substantial giving power and depth to music you stream. 3. They fit very nicely in my ears and, no matter how much I sweat on a run or doing yardwork, they remain in my ears once I have put them in place (the instructions on this are very helpful and really do lock these universal earbuds into your ears as if they were made for you - though to be fair I have larger ears so headphones do fit a bit easier). 4. The charging case and battery life are nice. I went two weeks after the initial charge upon receiving them in the mail before I had to charge them again.",5,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
"I usually don't leave reviews but I thought this was an excellent product. I bought these and a pair of Apple knockoffs to compare. The Apple knockoffs at first stayed in my ear better, but had worse sound quality and less battery. Then I bought some foam earbud replacements that expand. It helped sound quality/noise cancellation and for them to stay in my ear while walking around.I usually pull one out and put it in my ear so I can still hear what's going around me and it lasts about eight hours.",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"I was worried about these being too heavy and falling out of my ears but they have yet to do so, no matter how rigorous my work out is. They come with different ear bud sizes so you can easily customize the fit. The sound is awesome, really good bass and for that price, you can't go wrong. I tried more expensive brands and honestly couldn't tell much of a difference with respect to sound and comfort. They charge very quickly which is an added bonus and the microphone works very well. I ordered the beige ones which are much less noticeable, than a stark black bud. Really good bang for the buck!",5,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"I had a pair of AirPods for a few years, and the battery life went down to about 15 minutes or less, so I looked for a cheaper replacement, as I only use them at work so when I turn my head from my computer, an earbud doesn't get ripped out of my ear by a cable. These sound better than the cheap wired set I had, Everything seems good so far. I'll update if anything turns out bad. Audio quality isn't the same as my airpods, but that has more to do with the plug fit vs open fit of the airpods. (I can hear myself breathing with the noise canceling fit, and my joints moving)I would recommend these over anything in-between these and a premium brand. If you want premium, go for that, if you don't need premium, this is a great choice.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"These headphones are super comfortable, fit snugly (and come with extra earbud covers in different sizes), and sound great. I played a Hozier album and it sounded like he was in the room with me. Can't speak to the battery life yet, but I'll update if it's not good.",5,1,2020-6-22,1,1,0
"So... I'm new to these bluetooth earbuds. I had to buy a few in order to find that these were my pick. What's good about these is that they're consistent all around. Solid sound quality, especially for the price, good build, easy to connect, and no drops in sound despite being bluetooth. That was my big gripe with the Tribit, which I do not recommend. Much clearer mids as well, lesser treble and bass though.It also has a pretty good range, despite some reviews. Can kind of go through walls.  Just don't count on being more than 10-15 feet away from your casting device. Overall, very solid buy, excellent bang for your buck. Jack of all trades, and just generally good all around.",5,1,2019-4-11,1,1,0
My expectations when I first bought these Bluetooth earbuds:- The color being the same,4,1,2020-6-19,1,0,1
By far these have been the best wireless earbuds I've bought... You get your money's worth with these...I tried the Frogz and I thought they were good until I bought these.... the clarity is amazing!!! Easy to pair and recharges quickly and if fully charged they last a long time... I have converted my friends who now have them and they also really enjoy them...,5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,1
"I fully agree that I am really happy with my earbuds.  You can pair them separately, fits awesome and Great sound on calls.  Since I can use them separately, I can listen to my music for hours at end.Update I purchased TOZO T10 little over a year and a half ago.  They still work as awesome as ever, but my charger was starting to not hold it’s charge as long (normal for any battery charger).",5,1,2019-1-17,1,0,1
"Usually, you would pay about $100 for a decent set of Bluetooth earbuds, but these are a great bargain. The earbuds connect easily to your phone and the volume is loud. I keep mine at a low volume and still get a full immersion experience. They cancel outside noise to a high level to the point I could not hear car honk the horn right outside of my house. The battery lasts about 4 - 5 hours of continuous play time and the earbuds charge super fast in the carrying case. My only gripe is that the earbuds tend to come out from time with jolting movements. I ride my bike and hit bumps and an earbud has come out in on two occasions. Make sure you have the right size ear piece on for your ear but that still will not prevent the occasional loosening from extreme movement. I had no problem with them coming out when doing a gym workout.",4,1,2019-5-2,1,0,1
"Great headphones. Simple to operate, good battery life. Only issue was that I had to use some different silicone ear peices so that it would fit in my ear correctly because the ones that came with the earbuds didnt work for me. If these earbuds dont fit in your ear, just order a variety pack of the silicone earpieces to find out what works for you. Once I got that figured out these worked perfectly for me. A good value for the price as well.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
This is exactly what I wanted when I bought this product!Sound quality is amazing. The bass is the main thing I was looking for and it has plenty.,5,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"Usually ear buds fall out of my ears and I have to hunt down replacement rubber ends for them. The Tozo buds came with multiple options. They’re comfortable and easy to operate. The first time I tried my favorite playlist, I was absolutely amazed. It was like being in my own sound bubble. The bass and sound quality are great. My friend was talking to me with both buds in, I didn’t hear a thing. No pain as of yet from extended wear. Great product! Also, I’m so happy that these didn’t break the bank like most wireless headphone/earbud options",5,1,2019-8-22,1,0,0
"Great value for the money, really I feel like its a steal compared to other headphones on the market. This comes with a lightweight recharging case that actually charges fast. It also came with 4 different ear bud sizes which was super useful as I needed the smallest size it came with. And the case is a magnet to shut so no need to worry about a clip breaking.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,1
"I've had these for about a week now. They are easy to use. I like they're magnet and pop into the case very easily. The sound quality for calls and music is very good. However, your callers may be able to hear the noise around you better than you can, if that makes sense.  The only issue I've had is once or twice, the earbuds said they were connected but I couldn't hear anything. I unpaired and re-paired them and they worked.",4,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"I have the Airpod 2s and the AirPod pros. Neither of these expensive options will connect to my iPod. This is my third pair of wireless earbuds from Amazon. Theses Tozo earbuds  are by far the best earbuds and my favorite. The sound quality is amazing, the bass hits hard, and the sound is clear. I cannot complain. The only thing I wish it had are play control options. I would like to be able to rewind and fast forward from the earbuds not the device. But for $50, these earbuds are the best.Here is what I do with my AirPods when I’m listening to my Tozos.",5,1,2019-9-13,1,0,1
"I bought these earbuds because I needed something to use for working from home conference calls during COVID, but also wanted something I could use for workouts. These do both, and I couldn’t be happier! I have small ear canals and usually have issues with any earbuds without an ear clip piece, these came with multiple size in-ear pieces and the smallest option worked great!!",5,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
"I just unboxed these about a half hour ago. I ordered based on a lot of bang for the buck reviews. So far, I'm very happy with them. The case had a charge in the box, but I charged it up to be sure it was a good charge. The buds charged up in about 20 minutes. Pairing was a cinch, just have your device set for Bluetooth and scan for new items and remove them from the case simultaneously.  They paired up in a snap. Sound quality is even better than I expected for the price I paid. I've gone through several wired bluetooth earbuds,  mainly Skullcandy and Beats. The bass in these Tozos is clear and full. I highly recommend fitting them with the different cups or caps to find the right seal for your ears. It will make a huge difference in sound quality and comfort. I can't give a true rating on battery life yet, but ao far so good. I will be gifting a set to my kids in the future. I'm very happy the overall product.",5,1,2019-2-27,1,0,0
"I’ve had these for a week now. Sometimes the pairing is difficult, when I’m working I can only wear one side. Sometimes the ear piece that is in would beep for a while making you think that it can only be worn with both pieces in your ears. On the plus side, they do not and will not fall out . Though, feels like My ears are popped with them in, same feeling as when an airplane takes off. The mic for when you speak during a phone call is much better quality than AirPods, says my wife. I tried  AirPods before this purchase but they continuously fall out of my ears. I’m a grown man by the way",4,1,2019-3-7,1,1,0
"I am very happy with my purchase of TOZO wireless earbuds! They are very comfortable and do not fall out even when working out. The sound quality is clear and loud. Even if I have the volume very low, the noise cancelling feature works great! I love these so much I got a pair for my dad too! We love them! Also, the battery pack can charge them 4x and you can put a string on the charger too so you can wear it on your neck if you have no pockets.My only con is that the left earbud cannot connect without the right earbud being connected. But they're identical, so you can use the right one in the left ear if you want, so I still gave it 5 stars.",5,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0

"Basic wireless... nothing fancy.. returned mine because it sounded like a fan was running in the background.. not sure if they were defective or not but didn’t want a replacement.Also, really wished they were capable of using only the left bud at times. You can use the right one by itself but the only way for the left to work is if the right one is being used as well.",4,1,2020-7-22,1,1,0
The sound on these suck. The sound also goes in and out where I can only hear through one of them and then it will cut back in through both. They also don't automatically connect to one another. It usually takes several attempts to get them to connect to what ever device I am using. The wireless charging worked at first but now they will only charge if plugged in. Waste of money. That is what I get for going cheap.,2,1,2019-4-27,1,1,0
The sound is amazing I have songs in my playlist that I use to test ney speakers and headphones the sound that comes from these is comparable to my alexa 3rd gen the only down side I've found is that to see the amount of power left in the charging case you have to put the headphones in to be charged there should be a button that will display the amount of power left,5,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
"So I was looking for some headphones without wires and after reading reviews from the high end to the low end, I decided to go with these after a lot of good reviews.  I was looking for some strictly for the gym, something that could last at least 2 hours or more.  So far I love them.Pro:",5,1,2019-5-25,1,0,0
"I ordered these earbuds after my last pair (Phaiser BHS-730) died after only 2 years. I ordered these and have had them for a two weeks or so. I use them 5 days a week at work for around 5 hours each day. I am a commercial landscaper and mower. The sound quality is very comparable to the Phaiser BHS-730 I had, maybe a little better. It handles all types of music well. The highs and lows are definitely enjoyable. The battery life is interesting, they work excellently for me, but this is because I am able to throw them in the changing case and carry them in my pocket between jobs. They definitely charge quickly but the charge doesn’t last forever. They are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time and I love that I am able to wear sunglasses (no over ear hook to get in the way) and a winter hat (they don’t stick out of your ear too far) without any problems. The fact that they are very water proof is fantastic because I get rained on a sweat considerably at my job. And they will handle workouts well. The noise cancellation is pretty good. When the music is on (mid level or about as loud as most will listen) and the earbuds are properly seated I can barely hear the loud mower or backpack leaf blower I am using. The only thing that I don’t love about these earbuds is that you can not control the volume from the earbuds. You have to use your phone. Other than that, couldn’t be happier. I would definitely recommend buying",4,1,2019-5-12,1,0,1
"I was lucky enough to get a pair with touch control. I ordered the ""khaki"" which is actually rose gold. They sound amazing! The touch control is so handy! I loved them so much, I ordered another pair. This time I got black, only they had no touch control as far as volume and skipping songs goes. What the hell!? They're the same version, but not the same! Needless to say, I returned the black no-touch-control pair. I suppose a person could keep buying/returning until they get the good ones.",4,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0
"My kids have never needed the big name brands, so these blew them away when I got them for Christmas.  The biggest advantage for iPhone users is you can listen while charging.  Some of the newer Android phones don't have a headphone jack either, so they are nice in that instance too.  They came packaged as nice as you would expect of today's tech and out of the box were easy to set up.  Now our daughter barely speaks to us anymore.  Hooray.",5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"I received these headphones as a gift! The fit is not quite as good as that of an AirPod, but you get what you pay for! .They worked for about six months and then the right earbud stopped working.However after spending thirty minutes on the phone with amazon they finally gave me the email to Tozo who immediately helped me out! After giving them a few details, they sent me a new pair! Five star on customer service for Tozo! Although my first pair broke it was work thirty dollars. Great product I recommend to anyone who is looking for another option other than AirPods!",4,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"Really want to like them, still giving them the benefit of the doubt. Currently searching on why the constant changing of pitch, always cutting out, suddenly calls people, only a few uses on charge.I primarily use them when working out - this is not a vigorous work out, but more like walk 45 minutes then cardio for 15. The phone is in yoga pants pocket so it's not a distance issue. Originally thought it was connection issue so changed phone from wifi to data - that doesn't work. Nothing seems to work on constant cutting out. Then there's the pitch change - nothing like jamming to a song with base then suddenly there's no base then insane treble.  I'm still going to be optimistic.",3,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"I have tried for so long to use the iPods.  They simply don’t work for me.  For $40, these are great!  The fit nicely, cancel outside noise pretty well, the sound is not like what you would find with some higher priced items but it’s still very good!  The storage/recharging unit is nice looking and stays closed in my purse or pocket.  I’m pleased and will definitely purchase another pair should the need arise in the future.",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"I'm really impressed with these little ear buds. At first, I had the same problem others have reported where the left would cut out. I emailed the seller and got a response within a couple hours. They gave me instructions on how to reset the ear buds, which seemed to do the trick. About the only thing I could say is I wish the largest grommet was slightly bigger. However, I'm a giant, so that's more on me than these great sounding things. Highly recommend these buds and seller!",5,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"By far the best earbuds I have ever used! I purchased these do I could have some music during my runs, but after the first test I couldn't stop using them. Anytime I wasn't at school I would have at least one of these in at all times listening to some music. The battery is great, just keep you case on your person and you'll easily have enough battery life to get you through your day and some extra. The carrying case charges super quickly, and is suprisingly satisfying to open and close. Everything is built super well with high quality materials. The only time they have fallen out is after I got into a bad skateboarding accident, but even my phone flew out of my pocket at that point! I am absolutely considering buying this product again, and I recommend anyone reading this to buy them too!",5,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
"The sound is AMAZING. I had to - and recommend - adjust sound settings of my cellphone to lower the media volume settings because I think its too loud. Felt like i was going to go def because its so smooth, clear, and intense. I play it on the lowest volume level and it sounds great.Comes with USB charger.",5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,1
I sweat a lot during my workouts so I was concerned for my AirPods which really don't have any water resistance. The T10's IPX8 resistance is great. The fact that the even the case is water-resistant is so cool. I can take them to weights area but also to the pool area (so I can use them while my upper body is above of the pool or the hot tub). The sound is good and they provide enough privacy from surrounding sound (which is relevant for me since I also listen to a lot of audiobooks.),5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
These are a decent pair of truly wireless earbuds for the price. Noise cancellation isn't the best. I could still hear sounds around me but I'm ok with that.  I use them on my Galaxy S8 and music sounds pretty nice especially if you can adjust the music EQ. Bass sounds good and sounds are clear and crisp. I used them in the shower and they worked fine. Even after getting them soaked. I do think if any moisture gets on the silicone piece that goes in your ear they could slip out. I'm sure if you have the right fitting silicone bud it could avoid this issue. It comes with extra silicone buds. But when dry you can run and jump in them and they'll stay in. Every now and then I feel like there is a frequency issue because sometimes the left bud will go in and out but not always. It's enough that I wouldn't mind putting up with it. The microphone on these for calls isn't so great. I find myself having to raise my voice and almost yelling so the caller on the other end can hear me. I'm a truck driver so that's kind of a big issue for me. But if your just looking for truly wireless headphones for music these will do just fine.,5,1,2019-3-26,1,0,0
"They aren't Airpods (which I've lost 2 pairs of), but they get the job done.  The sound quality is not as good, but I do like that they seal the ear, which drowns out outside sound. The user features (on/off button, BT connectivity) aren't as streamless/user friendly as Apple.  The different earplug sizes suck. Small is the only comfortable one and that still hurts your ears.",4,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"These are my first bluetooth earbuds. I didn't want to spend the money for airpods. They work well. My major complaints are that even the smallest ear-thngy, falls out on one side, so I will only use at my desk and not walk around or take out of the house. The noise cancelling is good, but it has the feeling of ear plugs. If someone asks me a question, I have to take one out to hear them. Also, I can't fully hear myself so sometimes I am very loud speaking into them.",3,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"These were a good buy. If you're not trying to be too cheap, but you want something between the best and second-rate quality, these are great. In my personal experience, they aren't awesome for exercise (I'm a runner) and this might just be my ears while being active, but they're more than fine for everything else.I chipped the right bud while out on a jog (fell out of my ear to the ground) and the sound quality suffered a tad.  TOZO was helpful and delivered on a replacement. So I'm satisfied about the product, through and through.",5,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
"I wasn't sure about this pair of earbuds given how affordable it was, but right out of the box, it feels like premium quality!

Update a month out. Right ear quit charging. Contacted tozo and they sent me a new pair and they work great. Left ear does not drop at all. Sent me a wireless charger for inconvenience also. Customer service did a good job.The sound quality is excellent. They fit well in my ears. Very easy to use and connect. Charging case is convenient. Problem I have with them is the left ear cuts out a couple times a minute while jogging or working out. If sitting at my desk or driving they work great but I purchased them to use while working out so 3oo5 rating from me,4,1,2019-8-4,1,0,0
Sound quality is great....battery life satisfactory...but doesnt work well when using during exercising which is why I got them. Tried the different size ear buds. One of them works pretty well in my left ear but none of the options work very well in the left ear. Both will fall oit while jogging fairly quickly and eventually fall out while walking. Left does a little better than right. For me they only are consistent if using while sitting or maybe on stationary bike or something.,3,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"I use these all the time and I only spent a like 15$ more than my other earbuds that I hated! These have great sound, 3 diff size earbud pieces, the case charges on my wireless charger! No wires or fumbling around, it's great. I even wore them in the pool A LOT, they got wet and I even dropped one in the water! They were perfectly fine and work the same as day one...they are waterproof, but up to an extent. lol I am quite impressed. They get used very often! The cost was great, the packaging was impressive as well, and they came in the mail quickly. Def. recommend these.

At first I really liked these they seemed well made and everything. I ignored the fact that they didn’t fit my ears right and Dealt with it. Btw I did Change the size and they size feel out.  Then 3 weeks of use went buy and they stated getting really staticky and the sound was not as good. It’s only been 3 weeks since I bought them. Because of the static I started getting headaches. I tried to fix the issue thinking maybe they r connected to more then one device or something else is causing this static but nothing fixed. I honestly should of got a better pair because now I already have to dish out more money for a new pair.,1,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0

"These earbuds were at a great price point, and have awesome reviews. I wanted them to work for me, but they kept falling out of my ears. I work with gloves on and can’t just grab them when they fall out, so they are unusable for me. I ended up buying a different pair that stayed in my ear better. I would still recommend these for people that don’t have very small ear holes",4,1,2019-12-14,1,1,0
"I finally took the plunge into wireless earbuds and boy am I glad I did.  These earbuds offer great sound and even cancel out noise when listening at a decent volume (which was an added bonus).  I had been reluctant to go wireless as the ones I've tried from friends fall out of my ear.  These come with different size cups and after swapping out to the smallest size, I was able to go for a 3 mile run and not have to adjust them once.

Not sure if they are actually waterproof as I'm not going to purposely going to submerge them in water to test them, although I may try them out in the shower one day.

I love that the case holds a charge so I can just keep it in my pocket and when I need to switch them I can do it where I am at and not track down a cord till I get home later.

My one complaint about this particular product was it wasn't clear that I wouldn't be able to use each of the pieces seperately.When I bought these I knew that the ear buds wouldn't have incredible battery life (several hours without charge is still pretty great) but on my old set I would maximize the amount of time by alternating between the buds as one dies.  With this brand only the right earbud can be used independently of the left. (In the instructions they call it the ""slave/ master"" set up) so the left is dependent on the right. I didnt see that clearly before I bought them (maybe I didnt read closely enough.",4,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"After returning a different pair of wireless earbuds, TOZO's were the next on my list of bluetooth buds to try. Once I recieved them and put them on, I knew they were on a different playing field. When it comes to a good fit, they shine. I use the smallest size of insert and after following the given instructions, they felt right at home, barely budging and inch with vigorous head weaving and bobbing. Thankfully, this fit is not the only going for these bad boys. The sound is fantastic. Paired with the more than decent sound cancelling, the bass packs a punch I didn't think was possible on bluetooth buds like these. The depth of sound going on here is not to be passed up. I'm no expert on sound specs and quality, but I do know what sounds good, especially for the price that these TOZO buds are at. The pairing, after getting conifgured on my phone, works quickly and efficiently. The range on the bluetooth is quite good. I have yet to run into any connection problems with these buds. The battery life is just right. While I haven't driven them dry from a full charge, they shoe great promise for someone who doesn't intend to wear them every moment of the day. The charger is a nice shape, featuring simple to understand LED charge-level lights. Having the ability to wirelessly charge makes battery life a non-problem.Overall, I love these things. The ergonomic design might produce some soreness if worn for longer than a few hours, but which earphones won't do that? Give these ear phones a chance.

I've only had 1 pairing issue but that was easily solved once I followed the included instructions for resetting the earbuds. The case feels well made and durable and the battery life is great given how easy it is to simply let them charge in the case when not using them. I am only giving them 4 stars because I wonder if the performance will stay the same over an extended period, and the connection error I had once. Overall great product!",4,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"First impression: sound quality and bass are great! I love bass. Sound cancellation also great, My sister had to yell for me to hear what she was saying.  Had her test them out—she had AirPods—and says the sounds quality is “fuller” on these tozo 10 compared her airpods.  Volume is very good, airpods did not sound any louder. Comes with 4 sizes of earbud sleeves to give you a more secure fit and to have the desired sound quality. Fit highly affects sound quality.  I do wish they protruded less out of my ear.",5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"I would happily give this product five stars if the left earbud worked as well as the right.  The left earbud disconnects and reconnects every few seconds, making it impossible to enjoy listening to music.  I have paired the earbuds several times and the problem persists.  I didn't bother returning the product because I like to run with one earbud so I can hear traffic, but it's a shame that that is the only use these earbuds have.  Even then, the right earbud will spend the first several minutes after pairing with your phone annoyingly chirping as it searches for its useless slave earbud.Before you buy this, look at some of the 1-star reviews.  This company offers replacements if people delete their bad reviews.  You are their quality control department.  Absolutely unacceptable.",1,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
"Really happy with these headphones so far. They have just about every feature I could want: Wireless charging, waterproof, Bluetooth, good sound quality, easy to connect to phone, multiple touch controls on the headphones themselves. Everything works just as promised without any issues so far. For the price of these headphones, it seems hard to get a better deal anywhere else!",5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,1
"Whats not to like.  first off awesome price and they sound good. Some distortion once in awhile but not bad.  It is easy to see why these are number one Amazon seller.  A lot better than hanging big headphones on your head, especially in  Florida where the heat will really make you sweat with headphones on.I would of given them 5 stars but the print is so small in the directions, I had to use a magnifying glass to sort of read them.  I finally found how to use on the net",5,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0

"These are HORRIBLE! My boyfriend tried using them without complaint for a couple months and just couldn’t do it an longer. I decided to try them and wanted to throw them across the room. Every time I got them situated in my ear (I tried multiple size ear pieces) the damn things would fall out the second I tried talking. I would try to push them in to avoid dropping them, and I would disconnect the call...EVERY...SINGLE...TIME! Such a waste of money. Just buy the Apple AirPods and save the hassle of returning these.",1,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"I thought they were a great deal.  They look great.  Came in a nice case with a handy strap.  And I really wanted them to work, but...I tried pairing them with both my iPhone and iPad.  They kept cutting out.  So I tried charging them again.  And they're still cutting out on me.  And they won't stay in my ears.  I've tried adjusting them every way I could think of but one or the other falls out.  Very frustrating!  I give up.  How do I return them?",1,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
Excellent sound quality and easily to pair with many devices. I have 4 other pairs of earbuds and these are the best I have found.  I use earbuds every night to listen to movies on tv so as not to disturb the wife while she sleeps.  These are fantastic for that.  I also use them during the day to listen to music while walking or biking.  The Best Earbuds at an incredible value.  Everyone who needs earbuds should have at least a pair of these in there possession.  Awesome quality in the best earbuds I have found online!,5,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"The Earbuds initially worked very well, good battery life and sound quality.  For some reason, after a couple of months of eventual use,  one of the buds started malfunctioning as if it had a poor connection inside and suddenly, stopped charging and became useless.  Very disappointed, be prepared to be statistically surprised.",1,1,2020-7-9,1,1,1
"I love these earbuds! I have them on me constantly. They are incredibly easy to maneuver into a comfortable position from the case to your ear. Most of the time I do it with one hand.The package comes with three sizes of ear buds that you can swap out to reach the ideal comfort and noise cancellation. The ear buds stay in my ear really well. Once they’re in, I don’t have to adjust them at all. I’ve gone on 10 mile runs without having to worry about them at all. I also have no issue with their comfort or ability to stay in during high mobility and high impact workouts.",5,1,2019-4-26,1,0,0
I ordered the TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds to replace a pair of wired headphones that I have been reluctant to put to the side due to their outstanding sound quality.I saw a good deal on the Tozo T10 and figured why not give them a try.  The order was received quickly and I was very pleased with the quality of the earbuds.,5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
I mainly got these headsets because I sometimes like to wear a hat on a hot day and bulky over the ears headsets don't fit if I have one on. I usually don't get in the ear headsets because they never managed to fit me. They just pop out of my ear. But these are suprisingly snug and light. Its great to were for a couple of hours for workout and commute to work. An added bonus is that the seller cares about your purchase and how happy you are about it. It's a breath of fresh air on Amazon to be honest and I greatly appreciate that.,5,1,2019-4-4,1,0,0
"I only use buds for listening to music, not for phone calls, so I was disappointed to find the only music function with these is a pause function.  No skipping songs or going back.  As far as sound goes, I'm probably the only one that will complain they are too bassy.  It often sounds like the bass guitar is the loudest instrument on some tracks.  If you like a lot of bass (it's all about the bass, right?), you will love these.",3,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"I have tried many ways and tips to secure this in my ear. All to no avail. About the time you get it in and think it’s fine, it will fall out.I just can’t get comfortable with it and keep it in my ear.

"These are really good, I am not sure if it's just me but I can't seem to get them to fit right, I changed the plugs so it fits in my ear and got rid of the problem, one of the best sounding headphones I've tried, they look weird but they work so I don't care. I love the case and how they are waterproof, I don't have to worry a out the rain or anything, and the case is a little bulky, but I lose everything so it's perfect for me, I had AirPods and lost them, and I like these better, and the case and the headphones are waterproof. At the price point too there is nothing that would come close. I didn't need anything insane and wanted wireless and affordable and got exactly what I was looking for. And a plus for me is they had a blue one, I literally get everything in blue so not a necessity but really nice to have that option.",4,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"These are great Bluetooth earbuds. The water resistant feature is great... I was even able to talk on the phone in the shower and was told the sound quality was better than the Bluetooth  Set up in my truck. My only issue is that the size of the actual  Electronic component is still a bit large so when I am on a long sweaty run no matter how well the silicone interchangeable buds fit, the weight and the force from repetitive striding eventually causes the buds to slip out of my ears.",4,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"I purchased these earbuds based on the positive reviews and I am very happy. They are incredibly easy to charge and pair with a device. The case is sleek, but not so small that I will lose it around the house. They fit nicely in my ears and don’t come out. This sound quality is good! Even better then I expected. I am really enjoying this purchase. I would Definitely recommend these as an affordable alternative to the  expensive Apple ones.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0

"Update: problem resolved. Hear customer service!! So frustrating, I've only been using them for 4 months and they will not connect to charge.

"The sound is great, the person in the other end says it's the clearest they've heard my voice. Music sounds awesome in them! Best sounds I've ever had in either wired or wireless.

I think I finally found the one!",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"Initial impression: Sound quality and fit are great, there are several sizes and different shapes of the earbuds, so it's easy to get a comfortable fit. I tested my earbuds sound quality on a large variety of genres from Dubstep to Trance, Classical, Rock and Roll, and Country as I like basically everything, and the sound was great all around. Bass was a little weak as you'd expect from any earbuds, but better than most of the earbuds I've tried including the wired ones.I'll update on other aspects like the durability, noise cancellation, and signal strength once I've been able to test them out in different circumstances for a while.",5,1,2019-3-15,1,1,0
"I have had these earbuds for a little over 3 weeks now. I have used them multiple times while riding. I will say that you really have to keep an eye on them when you begin to sweat because they can fall out. I rode 3 hours and 15 minutes today on the road bike and probably had to push them in 12-16 times. What really bothers me is that the battery “can” last for 4 hours. Well it “does” last 3 hours after 3 weeks of use. Sooo, if you don’t actually exercise for more than 3 hours and you don’t sweat a lot when you do then these are the earbuds for you. On the plus side the sound is great and you don’t hear hardly any outside noise so they really are great, just not for what I do or for how long I go for. Not sure about longevity because of sweat yet. Hoping the IPX8 lasts longer than other IPX7 earbuds.",2,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"I recently purchased these since my Bose Wireless SoundSport Free Earbuds stopped holding a charge long enough to get through workouts after two years of ownership.  Apple ear buds and Beats ear buds never fit me well and always pushed out of my ear.  These don’t and sound great.  The carrying case is much nicer than the Bose one in my opinion.  The downfall of these are the button functions compared to others out there.  The only functions are play, pause, double click for phone call, and one other.  But there is no button function to skip to the next song, no triple click for previous song, and no volume controls.  Other than that sound great and to me at least $40 vs $200 for the Bose is worth it.  Not sure on longevity yet since it’s only been a week.",4,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"They sound great, when they are connected. The volume fades in and out and they disconnect a lot. I have used these with my previous phone and my new S9 Note, same issues.

I'm past the date to be able to return, so they will sit in a drawer.",2,1,2019-4-21,1,1,0
"Edit: So the company reached out to me and sent new pair which appear to work great. I suspect I may have initially gotten a defective product, but the new item sent works wonderfully. Would recommend!So I brought this primarily for listening to Audible, and in that capacity it works well. However (and I'm not sure if this is a defect or an intentional design) when listening to music it becomes clear that the left earbud seems to have practically no bass at all.",5,1,2019-4-18,1,0,0
"I bought these to use at the gym. The instructions were a little bit lacking but the product is great . It appears very well made, very sturdy. The color is darker than appeared on my screen ( I got the grey one) which is fine it just blends in to dark surfaces.  It came with 5 different ear plug sizes so I was able to fit them perfectly. They charged quickly, paired easily and performed great! I would purchase these again.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"Having lost my second pair of wired earphone Jaybirds, I decided to give these a try.  I've had the Tozo T10 earbuds for 2 weeks.  My expectations were exceeded for price I paid.  I've used them running and cycling with good result.  Occasionally on my ride, the left and right will get out of sync for 10-30 seconds, giving a very slight echo affect but readjusted quickly.  Sound itself has been very good, I mainly listen to voice ( audio books and podcasts with a little music).  Ive done several calls with no complaints from callers.  T10s have been very comfortable, wearing them 1 -2 hours at a stretch with no issues staying in nor on battery life.  They charger case is great, enabling 3-4 full recharges.Cons are very limited controls on earbud but mitigated by using phone to control  and no sound customization  (ie, no equilalizer to make tenor/base adjustments).",5,1,2019-6-5,1,0,0
Excellent sound quality and very simple to pair and use.  I received these wireless earbuds the other day after realizing my iPhone no longer has a port for earphones.  They have four different sizes of ear pieces so you are pretty much guaranteed to find the perfect fit.  I paired with my iPad and iPhone and wore them comfortably to watch a show while working out at the gym.  They delivered crystal clear sound and canceled out the gym noise.  I love them already.,5,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"Got these for daughter. I can't give any feedback on quality, but I can tell you that the color is off. Supposed to be rose gold, but they're definitely brown.

They replaced the product I bought with the T6 model (in black). They fit and sound great. A lot of features for this price point. I just received the new ones yesterday, but early signs are they're a good product. And, customer service is, apparently, good as well.",4,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0

"So I switched from the crappy beats headphones (went through two pairs within a year and a half) and needed some headphones for the gym and running. When I run, I run a lot and in hot weather so I sweat profusely, also I am an avid weightlifter so I needed wireless capability with battery life because I tend to forget to charge the phones after the gym sessions most days. I have had these for a week and can honestly say, these blow the CHEAPLY MADE power beats out of the water, they fit very well including while running, the sound quality is very well as it cancels out virtually the rest of the world, and because of the charging case, I really don't need to charge these every day. I don't plan on swimming with these on (it does say in the manual you can swim with them but not to submerge them?) but for everything I use them for, they work great. The price is well worth it if especially if you're an avid athlete like I am, I am very happy with these and will see how they hold up in the coming months. They come with a 1 year warranty which is also very nice.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"Buy theses if you like to boost the bass. It sounds like the bass is on 10 and everything else is on 7. Now, I like it this way. These are great for workouts. I even watched an action movie to see how these compare to an actual subwoofer. Well, they are not as good as surround sound with a ""real"" subwoofer BUT they sounded better than all my cheap gaming headsets and WAY better than my old earbuds. And they are definitely the loudest. If you listen to these on max volume you will be deaf.  I only purchased yesterday so I can't speak of durability of the t10 but sound is GREAT even if bass is really boosted. If you like edm or HEAVY bass buy these.",5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"I had to come back and show my support for this product after 5 months of use because of how shockingly satisfied I’ve been my purchase. I am frequently reminded of now much more pleasant my listening experience is since buying these. Apple air Pods hurt my ears, and in my mind they are too expensive for something that can be lost or damaged so easily. THESE WERE ONLY 40 dollars! The sound is clear, they charge in about 20 minutes. Their case holds 4 charges and whenever I take them off the case they automatically connect to the last linked device instantly. I can freely walk near or far from my device and continue listening smoothly. I use them almost every day, they sit in my ear comfortably for hours. I can’t get over how much I love them. I feel like I already got more than my money’s worth out of these, and the free one year warranty isn’t close to done. Thanks so much Tozo, seriously love you to death<3<3<3",5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0

I can even hear the individual background instruments when listening to songs, sounds that I had never noticed before!

"It is nice, but it felt heavyweight compared to other wireless headphones. Then, after a few weeks it started acting up and turing on while it is in the case.

"These are the second pair I have purchased. The first one was the black pair for my fiancé and this second pair are the white ones for me.

"I commute on the bus and was tired of fussing with the cords from the standard iPhone earphones. Getting on and off the bus, crowded, sometimes standing room only, digging out bus passes out of pockets, all was made more difficult with earphone cords getting in the way. Often I would catch a cord and the bud would be ripped from my ear. Enough! I had to go cordless. But I didn't have the desire to spend hundreds of dollars for the standard iPhone cordless buds. Especially not for a 25 minute bus ride. Looking at various alternatives, I read all the reviews and went for the TOZO T10. They are easy to pair, even between my personal phone, my work phone and my laptop. Sometimes I have all three and have bounced between them for music on one and a WebEx meeting on the others.

They fit comfortably in my ears and it sounds like a concert. It's almost as if you were in a perfect world with your music.

"I'm seriously impressed. I've never been a fan of wireless headphones or earbuds, but these have completely changed my mind. Based off the shape, I presumed they would constantly fall out like a lot of wired earbuds I've had, but they didn't move in the slightest even with me trying to make them fall out on their own. They're actually comfortable and have a really clean sound to them. It was also surprising how much outside noise these filter. The base seems stronger than my wired earbuds; not headphones level base but definitely solid. It was easy to connect them to my phone and they stay put even when I'm exercising. The built in charger case was also a pleasant surprise since apparently I somehow missed it in the now obvious product description.

The noise cancelation could have been better ( I used them in my car and people complained about the background road noise).  The are easy to use and appear to be well made/durable.  The only real problem is that they are very uncomfortable on the ear. They come with several cushion sizes for the inner ear, but the pain is caused by the way the outer portion rested  on the ear.

You cannot beat the comfort, sound quality, and battery life. I got a white pair for me and a gray pair for my husband. My husband is a music producer - he made a few adjustments to the sound settings on his cell phone and fell in LOVE!! Only surprise was that my white pair had a 1-yr warranty included inside the box and my husband's gray pair had an 18-mo warranty inside.

"I had recently been gifted a pair of cheap bluetooth earbuds and they broke only after a few weeks. I didn’t want to spend $200+ on something like AirPods, so I decided to find something more budget friendly. Being only $50, I was a bit skeptical on how long these earbuds would last and how well they would perform. However, they seem to be of good quality. I originally wanted something that would hook over my ears, but these seem to stay in just fine without the hooks (they also look more stylish). The different sized caps were nice because I could experiment with them to see which one would hold my earbuds in the best. I took these on a run and they stayed in just fine. I didn’t purchase these because they were waterproof, but I can say that they continued to work well when covered in some sweat. Pairing the earbuds takes me usually 15 seconds or less. I appreciate the little carrying/charging case that comes with the earbuds. It makes charging them so much more convenient. It feels kinda cool how they stay in the case magnetically. I’m not much of an audiophile, but I think that the sound is very good overall. There’s not much bass, but it is something I don’t really mind. I was kinda surprised how well these little earbuds block out sound and reduce noise. Maybe not at the level of headphones, but much better than most earbuds. Overall, the quality of these earbuds are very good for the price. They do exactly what I wanted them to do. The one year warranty is nice too. Highly recommend!",5,1,2019-8-12,1,0,0
The sound is excellent! Fit very well and they almost jump into the carry/charge box. After about 3 months they would only hold a continuous charge for about an hour of book listening.

"Great alternative to the much pricier ear buds.  They worked as described and came with 4 pairs of other ear pieces in case the default ones are too large.  Sound is great, and the unit can charge wirelessly.  It does take longer to pair again vs. other bluetooth headphones I have (about 10 seconds from taking them out of the case), but other than that, smooth sailing with these so far.

"They’re ok for the price. They’re a little big but they come with different sized cushions so they fit ok in your ear. The sound cuts in and out sometimes and when they do it’s relentless. It happens most when you’re moving around a lot. If my phone is still everything is fine, but for some reason the Bluetooth cuts in and out if I move my phone the wrong way. I know it’s not my phone because I have at least 3 other Bluetooth systems and it only happens with these headphones. That being said I can jog with them as long as my phone is strapped to my arm just so.Battery life could be better but if you just keep them plugged in when you’re not using them it’s no big deal.",4,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0
"EDIT: I contacted the seller, and told them my earbuds broke. They tried to bribe me into leaving a five-star review before they would send me a replacement.

"Great starter ear buds. I had been looking to get some but the ones at the local electronic stores are so spendy. My ears don’t fit air pods and I wanted something different. Read all the review and decided to try these and they are great! They fit my ears. They have different sizes though. They sound great! Good base and they feel like I am not wear anything at all!

I do hear a beeping sound in the right ear bud when the left one is in the charging case! I use these for work only, to listen to music on a low volume. because I work in healthcare I can not use both at one time. I dont know if the beeping is because one is being used and the other isn’t! If that is the case, these ear buds are not for the use of one at a time!",5,1,2019-8-24,1,0,0
"I had gone through two pair of the Apple wireless ear buds and lost both pair due to their falling out of my ears becasue of the loose fit!  I read many reviews and looked at several options before settling on the TOZO 10t.When I received the earbuds, I charged them and began using them right away.  I did have to change out the buds to provide a snug fit and once I did,  they did fit perfectly and provided a comfortable fit.  Be certain to rotate the buds once they set in the ear!  This prevents their falling out and loss.",5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"I knew it was too good to be true.  These things are duds.  They work great for the first month or two, and then it happens.  They start continuously needing to be charged.  They start reporting the wrong battery % on Windows 10 so you think it has a full battery but -- SURPRISE -- it dies in the middle of a Zoom call.  Typical crap, buyer beware.  They last long enough to where you can't return them.  Best to stick with the big players if you want reliability, all these Amazon cheap knockoffs flooding the listings are garbage.  This is the second set I've tried with the same.Exact.  Results.  Shame on me, but hopefully this deters you to learn from my mistakes.  It's cheap for a reason.",1,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"The earbuds overall work great, nice clean looking case and assortment of earbud sizes. However, fully charged and not used, the battery will die within less than a week. So not practically portable unless it's constantly charging when not in use.UPDATE: They offer a very generous offer ($40 or free T6 earbuds) for low reviewers like this one, which explains the overwhelmingly high rating of a highly mediocre device.",2,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"Just got an Apple Watch5.  First one.  Had to find ear buds that really would fit.  Wow!  These do - only ones out of 5-6 I’ve tried.  Noise cancellation is okay - but I don’t care as much about that.  Usually only wear Right bud so can stay tuned into what’s going on around me.  Excellent sound (especially for the money!) with both in.  I LIKE THESE WAY BETTER THAN APPLE AIRPODS!  For a lot less $$ money, too!",5,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0

"I can't wear airpods (including the Pros) because they hurt my ears. These are very comfortable though I do push them in sometimes. The battery life is not very long so I find myself charging them constantly. They are not noise cancelling. They have flashing lights on the side that don't turn off so they are very obnoxious to use in the dark which is frustrating as a college student with a roommate. The music quality is good, but calls are not. I would have loved if the buttons on the side controlled music, not calls, especially considering the call quality is too poor to use them for that. For the price I would get them again but don't expect professional quality wireless headphones.",4,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
Headphones did not stay paired to each other and the battery life was very short. I saw other reviews showing this but hoped for the best. When unboxing the headphones I thought they had a sleek feel and paired the first time with ease. The next morning when I tried to use them the would not stay paired to each other and my phone. I ended up messing with my headphones instead of exercising. I ended up returning them.,1,1,2019-12-19,1,1,0

I am loving my new ear buds. I was skeptical at first because I didn’t think they would stay in my ear or even be comfortable. They not only are staying put but are extremely comfortable to wear.

"Overall these headphone are great. The sound is great and the noise cancellation is so good! The only thing I don’t like about them is that they stick out of my ears too much and doesn’t feel very stable in them. If I run they feel like they’re gonna fall out. And also, you can’t just use one. Both of them have to be out of the case for them to pair. Since they are soundproof I feel like the option of just using one is required.",4,1,2020-2-7,1,0,1

"This appears to be the only reasonably priced truly waterproof, truly wireless ear buds that you can wear in the shower and such. Unfortunately the microphone quality makes it useless for calls, and the company apparently has poor quality control because the first one developed a strange issue with the audio coming out very quiet on one side, and the replacement device the company provided has a weird buzzing in response to certain frequencies, which is rather annoying and makes for very poor audio quality overall. I was going to give them another shot with a return but the return window expired before I got around to it, so I guess I'm left with a decent and usable wireless, waterproof earbud set with poor audio quality of both the microphone and sound drivers.Edit: I discovered that even though the Amazon return period expired, the Tozo warranty still had me covered.

I don’t really ever write reviews but these head phones are worth a review!The reason why I give them 4 stars is because I found that when I use them at work and I’m walking around (with my Bluetooth devise in my pocket) it would occasionally cut in and out for a few seconds.

The bass was exactly what I was missing in my 3 other pairs of headphones. I really like the noise canceling, too. I really think I could pop my eardrums if I tried to listen to full volume. These really do a good job of giving me great sound so I can block out outside noise and really focus.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0

They stay in place, connection is great-I can walk around my apartment without my phone.The battery box is the coolest part. If it's fully charged I wear my buds for 3 rounds of three hour sessions before I have to plug the box in to charge. Doesn't seem to matter how long in-between uses. I just put them back in the box when I'm done using them and they charge back to 100 % so I can go days without recharging the box depending on use.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
The sound quality is fantastic for listening to music. Very clear with audible highs and deep punchy bass. They fit in ears well and they last a long time on a charge. Also the the case charges the earbuds and the case can charge wirelessly also which makes it very convenient. Only drawback is the quality of the sound heard by people on the other end of the call when using it for a phone headset. They say it is muffled.,4,1,2019-8-25,1,1,0

That works great too. I am very satisfied with this purchase. For the money, cannot be beat.",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0

Can easily start play just when holding the earbud in my hand, if not very careful.",5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0

UPDATE: so someone from Tozo saw my review and saw that I was having trouble reaching out and offered to give me an upgraded pair for free or an amazon gift card the the amount of money I spent on the first pair. Customer service through this whole process was a breeze.Sound quality is amazing. They were great until about two weeks of using them the right earbud completely crapped out. The woman’s voice is super annoying and she started sounding like when in a cartoon they shoot the talking stuffed animal and the voice gets all deep and slow. Then it wouldn’t turn back on nor charge. So now I’m stuck offshore for another month and a half with only one working earbud and I use them all day Bc this ship is loud and I actually work all day so I’m highly pissed. The company is all Chinese so idk how to even get in touch with someone for customer service or anything. $40 isn’t much but it’s annoying when you have no way of getting more,5,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0

If not 'the best sounding earbuds I have ever heard connection is pretty solid listened to them for 6ish hours and the connection didn't drop . After about 6 to 6.5 hours the voice assistant in the headphones alerted me that the battery needed recharging which I just popped it back in the case which charges the earbuds wirelessly.

"I had a pair of expensive headphones (the brand name isn't coming to me right now for some reason) that were over $100. I loved the sound but they broke in under a year of me having them. For a poor college student who worked hard to set aside that money, it was really disappointing. So, I turned to Amazon to find a cheaper pair and I was apprehensive because I am picky about sound quality. These ones are GREAT! They sound pretty much the same as my expensive ones, they come with multiple tips so you can find the ones that fit best in your ear, and they are affordable. I knocked one star off the ""noise cancellation"" feature because they don't block out sound like some other headphones but it's not obnoxious. I like that I can still kind of hear what is happening around me when I go for walks by myself. Not a bad thing at all.",5,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0

I do want to mention that the right one works consistently but not so much the left bud. At home they are above average and have range pretty much throughout the house when away from the device. Battery life seem good but I haven't timed it.  Charger is decent weight and I've charged buds up to four times per charge, And the case lid is secure.

"The Tozo T10 is an ok head set when it comes down to the way that it's set up for charging and easy storage when not in use.*However the main problem with Tozo T10 is the reception it has when out doors. For example if you are outdoors jogging or just walking and you put your cellphone in your pocket the reception becomes very poor very fast for some reason or the other. I have tried the same thing with different cellphones just to make sure the problem was not the phone itself. Yes, it has been confirmed that the Tozo T10 will not function properly (very poor reception) if you're out doors and what ever listing device you are using your Tozo T10 earbuds with is either in a purse or in your pocket",2,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0

I can listen for a few minutes and then the connection messes up. I have tried to fix them by docking but...$40 down the drain 😭 I love listening in the shower.

These ear buds really give you a lot of bang for your buck.  They sound great and are really easy to use.  For the price paid I would definitely recommend them.  I can make it through the work day on one charge usually as I alternate one in each ear and with the case charging while not in use it really makes a big difference.After one month of use I did have an issue with the left one going out but the manufacturer is replacing them both free of charge.  If I have any other issues with the replacement I'll update the review.  Other than this I've been extremely happy with them they are easy to pair with my iPhone and sound great!,5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"These headphones are too big. I put on the smallest ear piece attachement and they still didn’t fit well and kept falling out. I have no problems with other wireless headphones when it comes to size so I don’t think my ears are strangely small. They also protrude out of the ear a decent amount. All in all, they don’t fit well and look awkward. I can’t judge the sound quality since I couldn’t use them as designed.",2,1,2019-1-31,1,1,0
"My sister bought these for her husband and he loves them for his active lifestyle. With their recommendation I ordered 2 pairs-one for myself to use for exercising and one for my husband to use while he mows grass/fishes. I used mine tonight on a high intensity walk with my Apple Watch 4. They sounded great and cancelled out pretty much any outside noise, but they cut out so bad it drove me absolutely insane. Every 10-30 seconds the music cut out like a cd skipping. The hubs has only used his for about 15 minutes but he says they seem fine so far. I, however, am super bummed out and guess I'll be returning. After reading customer reviews when I got home I found that probably 30-50 other customers experienced this problem as well, but in a sea of over 1000 good reviews they seemed like a great purchase at the time.

Man where do I even start?! These earbuds have far exceeded my expectations! My purchase was a little over a month ago. I needed to wait a while to give it a true and experienced review.The main point I want to cover is the sound quality. It is simply amazing. And I ain't speaking light-heartedly. I've had my fair share of horrible headphones and earbuds. You can hear the beat and the treble in one intricate unison. The battery life speaks for itself as well. Haven't had it die on me in the middle of a groove. The noise cancellation is flawless. Not a single peep from elsewhere. The only sounds you hear are from those coming from these earbuds. I also love that you receive 3 or 4 different earbud sizes. Had to switch out to find the best that fit my ears.,5,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0
I received these about 5 or so days ago and so far I am pretty impressed. They are very well made quality wise and the sound quality honestly shocked me was way better than most other forms of earbuds I've had in the past. I really love the charging case that they come in. Fits in my pocket so I can care it around at work and charge basically whenever I need too. The only down side is the battery life. Now for the record the estimated amount of hours on full charge I believe is 3 to 4 hours which so far that is true. I rated the battery life 3 of 5 because I know of other wireless earbuds that last 7 or more hours each charge. I also haven't used them for phone calls mostly listening to music or watching youtube. But I will say that while I was out walking I tried to call upon my Google assistant with my phone in my pocket with the earbuds in and it couldn't pick up my voice.  But for what I wanted to do with them I can just wish they lasted more and a few hours between charge.,5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0

(It's also my preference, so wanted to try something new.)Straight out of the box, I was able to pair it easily with my phone, my computer was a bit harder, but that was just due to outdated bluetooth drivers, and I managed to solve that issue.While the quality for sound is not perfect, it's great for the price, and I personally love to hear the bass in everything, so I was already happy they seem to bring out the bass in things well.",5,1,2019-9-6,1,0,1
"I've owned a pair of Bose Soundsport Wireless headphones for a couple of years and absolutely loved them but I've been searching for a set of true wireless earbuds. Airpods and Airpod pro's weren't an option, just don't like the way they feel in my ear. The Raycon earbuds looked promising but after a conversation with a co-worker who had purchased the Tozo T10's instead because of their great reviews and price, I took his advice and purchased a pair. Do yourself a favor and buy a pair. Great quality and sound with 5 sets of inserts to choose from they'll fit just about anyone. Wireless charging is a plus. They pair easily, I have an iPhone X and it took all of 30 seconds to set them up. Battery life seems to be good as well, only had them for a week so if that changes i'll update my post. Just can't beat the price, just wish I had discovered them before Christmas, they would have made excellent gifts.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
I have only had these for a few days but I am very pleasantly surprised. The sound quality is very clean and clear. They pair very easy after the first initial pair. Now I just take them out of the case and they auto pair up with my phone. Have put them through more then maybe an hour of use so i cant say to much about the battery life. But the hour i used then they never lost connection or made it seem as if they were dying. The product page says they can go 3-4 hours and just based on the quality of these I'd say that they could definitely go that long. They also sit very comfortably in my ears. I was lucky and didnt have to change the buds the stock ones that came o  it fit perfectly. I even shook my head rather hard and they didnt fall out. All in all I'm very impressed and would recommend picking them up.,5,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
"These headphones sound amazing!  I was looking for earbuds that 1.) Fit and stay in place, 2.) Sound great, 3.) Have functionality.  2/3 isn't bad!  They fit and sound great but you can't skip tracks forward or back.  I can't activate Seri to make calls and if I double click either earbud it dials the last phone number I called.  Convenience wasn't the primary factor for my purchase and I have another set of earbuds that have all of the functionality I want but don't sound that great.  So for sound and fit 5 stars.One thing that I'll note and the primary reason for my 3-star review is the battery life for the recharging box is really low.  I only used them for three, thirty-minute bus rides and the charger only has one dot left.  For this same reason, I had to have the first pair replaced because the charging box was drained after one charge.  Not sure what's going on there, but otherwise an excellent set of earbuds.",3,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
Perfect for what I wanted. I didn't want to spend 140 on ear buds that didn't or didn't like. They are comfortable don't fall out and the battery on one charge seems to last about 2 1/2 hours. The case is small and convenient and charges the ear buds fast. It has a nice indicator on the box. It was easy to pair with phone and mp3 player.Putting the ear buds back into the case is great.... They are easily marked R & L and the magnets make sure it stays in the box. I may get another pair!!,5,1,2019-6-27,1,0,0
"Love this product! It comes with different size earbuds so you can fit the right size for you. They stay in place and do not loosen or fall out of ears. Sound quality is awesome!! You get full stereo sound. They pair to your phone, tablet, laptop so easy. You don’t have to push and hold any buttons to pair. Devices recognize them quickly and easily. Fast pairing. They instantly pair to each other as soon as you remove them from charging case.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"I was a little concern about ordering these earbuds but after speaking to one of my brothers, I decided to place my order. They were delivered when I was supposed to get them.  The package they came in was just simply beautiful. It came with easy set up instructions, both earbuds worked great and the sound was just amazing with listening to music. These are my 1st set of earbuds that I've purchased, so it's taking some time getting use to them. But overall they are great.",5,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0
"These are great. The sound quality is decent. Bass is heavy and tight. Good sound stage too.The only issue I've noticed is that when the battery is low, it will shout in your ear every 30 seconds and die after a couple of minutes. Very annoying.",5,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0
I can not believe the sound quality. For the price this is a great purchase. The only negative I have found is both phone calls I have received had poor connection for me to hear the person I was talking to. They could hear me great but I could hardly hear them. Maybe it was a fluke (and in that case I would rate this 5 stars). My Dad said he could hear me better than when I talk to him from my actual phone.,4,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"I really liked these when I first got them. However, now I can't get the left one to charge. Even after trying all tips suggested on line. I would contact the company but won't since I attempted to previously contact them via email and never received a response. My previous issue was that while these paired immediately to my iPhone and iPad, they will not pair with my Amazon Fire. I'm not at all happy!",2,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"I use bluetooth earbuds to listen to podcasts when I'm virtually doing anything during the day. I needed a pair that would stay in comfortably, pair automatically, and charge without any issue.I owned the SoundPeats brand that were good, but the charging station was not the best and it was incredibly difficult to pair the two together. These Tozo earbuds are far better in comparison and the cost is similar. They pair to your phone automatically when taken out of the charging station, have a magnetized charging station so there is no missing the charge adapter, and have multiple ear pieces to accommodate all people.",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,1
"I previously gave this product a bad review, as it didn't work on my cell phone.  After linking these with my wife's phone, I discovered that the problem was not these earbuds--they seem great--but rather that the bluetooth on my phone seems to have a hard time syncing with devices.  I wonder if other bad reviews have similar issues--worth checking if the issue is your phone or your earbuds.",4,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"These are my first true wireless earbuds, and I have to say I'm impressed! Listening to music and following along with workouts without wires is truly liberating. Speaking of workouts, I primarily jump rope for exercise, and these things stay in the whole time! I'm glad I don't have to worry about fidgeting with them mid-workout. As far as sound quality, I'm no audiophile by any means, but I do care about sound quality and love a good set of speakers or headphones. These buds sounded a little weird out of the box, and discovered there was a bit of latency between right and left. I turned them off and on and boom! Perfect. While there is an obvious response curve (fairly bass-heavy), I find these to be very enjoyable to listen to. Plus, once you find the best eartips, they are comfortable and won't fall out. Overall, I am very satisfied with these earbuds! Great price, great quality.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"HMMMM....😀  Great outta the box!  Its another great selection by Amazon.  Great sturdy storage case. (Wireless charging too.) I luv that there is a main bud that quickly syncs with the other, as you're removing them from their case.  I'm using them with my Bethesda games and music listening. Great sound quality while blocking out other sounds and noises.Haven't used them in the shower yet.",5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"I ordered these true wireless earbuds after reading a tin of reviews. I was super happy with this purchase. These by far are the BEST earbuds I've had in a long time. My beats, ludacris, and JBL's dont even hit as hard. Great noise cancelling ability and they have a great fit.Unfortunately, my right earbud went out and only the left works. I contacted the vendor and they have been absolutely the easiest to work with. I tired their reset protocols but the right still didnt work. Not a problem, I let them know and they're sending a new set for me. That's outstanding customer service and I appreciate their willingness to work to make it better. I've already bought another pair for my wife and she loves them.",5,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
"I am so impressed with these headphones!  I've been afraid to try wireless headphones for fear of reduced sound quality, but these far exceeded my expectations!  I'm amazed with the bass quality.  I am also very impressed with the click features; they are very easy to use.  Listening to music has never been more fun on the go!  The commands for taking phone calls are very intuitive and my friends all say the call quality is very good!  I highly recommend these headphones and have been telling all my friends to get them!",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,1
"The TOZO T10  not only stay in my ears but deliver clear sound that is truly amazing.  I have used these to listen to the blues, jazz, classic rock, and audiobooks. In each case, these earbuds exceeded my expectations. While I didn't purchase these for noise cancelling, they do block extraneous sound from surroundings. I am stunned that these T10's  are priced so reasonably for what you get.",5,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0
I had a pair of ofusho headphones before purchasing these since I lost them and they are even BETTER! Others are pretty good sound but very low volume. These seem to have a little break in time but it’s quick and they are loud and crisp. They have excellent sound quality because I am hearing details in the music I could not pickup before. Also they have great deep BASS notes. I really like these and all the reviews were correct. They can be loud if needed when outside and have excellent quality all around. My new favorite headphones. My wife loved the fit bc only AirPods work for her normally so she bought a pair too!,5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"Headphone looks really good and it does feel very comfortable when you put in your ears. Sound is great. I like the quality of sound too. So here is the sad part, when you are running or moving, the sound keeps cutting off in the left side  headphone. If you do not move there seems to be no problem, but when you start moving the left side headphone cuts off in and out. Looks like the pairing between the left and right is not good. Sorry I am returning it.",3,1,2019-8-14,1,1,0
"Wow. Seriously amazing product at a fraction of the price vs the competitors. I stumbled on these while I was about to buy the skullcandy wireless buds and I am glad I did. I even compared these with my studio beats and these are very good. The battery life is also amazing. I love the fact that if I run out of power with one I can pull out the other one from the case and charge the other one. These also feel like they are made with good quality materials. All I have to say is give this a chance, if you don't like it get your money back.",5,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0
"I have to say I was pretty impressed with the Tozo T10's. Packaging and build quality is high-end. Wireless charging is a bonus. IPX8 waterproofing is the icing on the cake! I am an avid mountain biker and these perform in the rain without issue so far.Pairing was simple. Just make sure you take them both out of the case at the same time and choose TOZO-T10-R. These sound just as good as high-end earbuds but at 1/4 of the cost! I have some wireless Beats and I can't tell the difference. I wanted something I could ride with and not worry about a $200 investment! I typically ride for 60-90 minutes and I can easily get 2 rides out of them before recharging. The charging case is top notch as well. It's quite sturdy and can be charged wirelessly. Can't say enough about these little earbuds. If you're in the market for some earbuds, look no further. You won't regret this buy!",5,1,2019-2-28,1,0,0
"Just finished trying them out after taking them out of the box. I was hesitant buying these because some people said sound quality was awful, but I disagree! It sounds like you'd expect regular headphones to sound.  I haven't done a workout with them yet, but they seem to stay pretty well in my ears. Not heavy enough to bother me. Easy to use after pairing them with my phone for the first time, just put them in your ears and make sure your bluetooth is on. Haven't experienced any issues with the left earbud.3 week update: I'll be returning these. They fall out even when I'm sitting. I cant find any accessories to make them fit any better and I cannot be fiddling with my earbuds every 5 seconds during my workouts anymore. I have tried working out with all the different sizes of buds and they fall out and loosen immediately regardless of what size I use. This also eliminates the noise-canceling aspect too, I can hear the people next to me breathe. Btw: the earbuds fell out as I wrote this update sitting on the floor. Good pairing and sound quality though.",2,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
These are an amazing for the price!! I like that you can use each headphone individually since I usually just wear one headphone when I’m at home. My Jabra pair was more than 3x the price and it only lets you use the right channel by itself. The left channel doesn’t work on its own.The sound quality is good. The battery lasts a long time. I definitely recommend them if you don’t want to splurge on the more expensive brands.,5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"I like these headphones. the sound quality and fit are exceptional. The commands are clear and precise - you know when they're on in you ears, paired together, and paired with your audio source device.The only thing I don't like is sometimes when I've stored them in their charging base they will pair with my phone. They should never turn on and pair with my phone when they are in their charging base. The only way you'll notice this is by seeing the paired headphone signal on your phone. Just this morning I woke up, picked an app on my phone to listen to my favorite radio station and noticed that my phone was paired with the headphones that were stored in their base in a pocket of my backpack. kind of ridiculous...good thing the battery life is exceptional.",4,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"This product has a very fragile Bluetooth frequency. When I listen to my music or anything else I have my iPod Touch in my left pocket; so when I go out for walks the music stops for about a second whenever I turn my head left and right to check for dangers such as cars. It even happens when I reach into my pocket to grab my iPod to pick a different track or album. This makes me question its ability to with hold the Bluetooth connection when swimming in water. The earbuds don't stay snuggly in my ears and are easily to fall out, yet I use the smallest rubber cushions because I have small ear canals. Finally, over a month of using it, this product has activated itself three times while the ear buds are in the case. To deactivate them I deactivate the Bluetooth receiver on my iPod. However, by doing that, and turning the Bluetooth back on the battery in the charging case is spontaneously dead.",3,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"No need to waste your money on this. Pay a few bucks more and get a better product. This thing can not hold a charge. The ear bud AND the base unit, if left alone and disconnected will completely drain of power on its own when not used. Now that I’m out of the return window, it’s garbage. Completely useless. This does not happen with other similar knockoffs, including the ENACFIRE F1 which I also own and is superior.",1,1,2020-8-6,1,0,1

"I was not knowing what kind of quality to expect from my TOZO T10 wireless bluetooth ear buds. I must admit, I am really pleased and happy with the quality, sounds, and comfort of these buds. The noise canceling quality is so good that I don't have to turn my volume super high to hear my music. Good Rich volume all the way around. I'd encourage everyone to give these babies a try, you won't be sorry!",5,1,2019-8-23,1,1,0

The first time i used them i only used the right and had no issues except i cant pause by tapping on it. Sounds good. The next time i used both and once again sounds great but still couldnt use any of the features and when calls are made all background sounds get picked up so i cant use them for calls. The next time i used them i used the right until it died which was about 3.5 hours of continuous use. I put the right ear bud in the case to charge and tried using the left only and ut wont connect. Put both in and the left worked. So not worth the money for me. I cant use them like i need too.,2,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"I have always been skeptical about using wireless earbuds but these earbuds totally changed my mind. In the past I have use earbuds where the sound quality was bad or would even lose signal despite the phone and earbud being close to one another. I have also had ear buds where the mic did not pick up my voice well. All of these concerns were resolved with the TOZO T10. I have had the ear buds for about one week since the writing of this review and I have nothing to say but praise so I will just mention points that are important to me.First, the sound quality is very good. I use the earbuds for music and calls and the sound has always been clear. The earbuds also produce a surprising amount of bass which I would say is comparable to what you would get from wired ear buds/phones. I also like that you have the option of using one or both wireless ear buds and the sound quality does not suffer.",5,1,2019-6-6,1,0,0
"I like how this earphones are first and foremost ipx8 grade water-resistant, these are good for working out, it won’t fall out of your ear even if you move alot. Sound quality is better than a good number of them out there, noise-cancellation is only passive (means it cancels out noise a bit only because the earbuds are exactly fit, but there’s no noise cancellation feature on the earphones itself). Overall these are great set of earphones especially for its price, also this comes with 1 year warranty from Tozo which is cool!",5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"The sound quality of these earbuds are very good. They’re very easy to connect and easy to use however I notice from time to time that the sound in my left earbud cuts out for no reason. It’s only momentarily but just the same it can get a bit annoying. Also, I have a hard time keeping these in my ears. They will definitely fall out if you’re not careful. I like that they automatically connect as soon as you remove them from the charging case and they automatically disconnect when you put them back. All in all, I could live with all of it except the sound cutting out. I may send them back.",4,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
"I've had these for about a week now, and really like them. I previously had wireless, but wired earbuds, and it's amazing how much more comfortable running is without having a wire on your neck. The build and feel of the headphones are great. Sounds is perfectly fine for podcasts/audiobooks. Battery life is a bit of the shorter side ~3h, but since you are conditioned to put them back in the charging case, it stretches the battery life to a more substantial timeframe--I've only had them ask to be recharged once in the countess instances that I wanted to listen.Will continue tracking longevity, but so far these are excellent and I'd buy them again! Bargain pricing at <$50!",5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
The price point on theses was right where I needed it to be.  I didn’t want the $10 and $20 knock if’s that only last 20 minutes before needed I g too be recharged.  And I didn’t want to pay $150-$200 for ear buds I’d be devastated if I lost.  So... after reading many reviews I chose these.  They were easy to set up and pair w my phone.  (Didn’t need to enlist my kids help for once!) sound is great.  Hope they last 💛,5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0

Update: They sent a new pair (updated model even) but it still wouldn't keep a strong connection to my iPhone when I was in motion. Trying to ride a bike and having the music skip every 10 seconds is not ideal. Will update from 1 stars to 3 stars because they really went out their way and they do work when you are not moving fast.Guess I'll have to spring for AirPods :( ... these headphones disconnect sporadically during VC on laptop and cut in/out while listening to music on iPhone. Great sound when they actually do work.,3,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
This is my first pair of wireless earbuds and I was  unsure if I would like them or not. I love them! They connect easily with my phone and laptop (after reading the instructions about connecting the main earbud first!) and they sound great.

"These headphones seem of good quality but there are definitely some issues. #1, no matter what I do, they seem to have a hard time fitting in my ear.

The bass is minimal and overall its a very mediocre sound experience. #3, the left headphone is constantly disconnecting while listening.",3,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"Very satisfied with these. Unlike other models, you can use just one earbud at a time and leave the other in the case. Other models require you to have both out of the case for the sound to work. Since I only use one earbud a lot of the time, having both out would mean one would get lost or broken. They have also stayed like new over several months of use. I will buy this brand again if anything happens to the set I have.",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"Battery life is lacking and it has no controls from the buds like double tap to skip. Some people say they are able run with them, but for me I have to readjust them while jogging so not the best for active movement but i5 can work. If they had one size bigger ear inserts then maybe it would work better. I do like the sound and bass quality for such cheap buds. Also the ability to use QI charge is convenient.  The ability to throw them in my pocket makes them portable and great for when I go solo to Disneyland for the day.",3,1,2019-3-2,1,0,0

The bluetooth v5.0 provides for a better connection as greater distances. The clarity and richness are of a quality that one would expect from a high end earbuds. I have not tested the water prof feature of the T10's although I am certain that they will live up to the expectations of the seller. I was pleased to find that I could use the T10's for a little over four hours before they required a charge and that I was able to get four charges from the case before the case batter required recharging.",5,1,2019-9-29,1,0,0
"Good earbuds for the price, they don't fizzle out before I'm done with my workouts at the gym.  I like that the case is good up to 4 charges and they power on automatically when removed and power down when placed back into the case to charge.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the right earbuds is louder than the left, but for $45 buck what can I expect?Update:. I bought my wife, daughter, and son a set for Christmas.

Due to a manufacturing defect, the right headphone has died.With that said prior to that, the sound quality has been great and battery life excellent. I usually get through most of my work shift and then some with out any problem listening to music or audio books. For their size sound range is great and base comes through well considering their size. As for the noice cancelation, it’s not the best on the market, but in terms of their size they do an adequate job and block most noise. By the time your playing anything most noice is cut out. Load noises  do come through, like with the lawn mower, but it’s definitely better then just plain headphones.",4,1,2019-9-29,1,0,0

I’m usually pretty bad with misplacing & losing things, (Especially little things) but since I like these earbuds so much I haven’t lost em yet, I always make sure to remember about them.Overall the product is great and I recommend them to everyone, I’ll probably buy another pair if I ever lose them.",5,1,2020-3-16,1,0,0
"Updated 9/23.... wore these on the plane yesterday and the sound was phenomenal.Original:  I have to say, I can see why these have such a great review.  I tried with the buds with the covers that came on them, then tried the smallest and by the time I was done I found that the Large gave me the best sound quality of all of them.  I guess it is not about whether it fits into your ear canal but how well it blocks our surrounding noise etc.  So far I am extremely happy with them although I did get a call and had to pull one of the pieces out as it sounded strange to me :)",5,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0
"I've only had my earbuds for a week now, but they work great. The sound is very clear, people can hear my without any static when I make phone calls, they stay in without wiggling when I'm working out, and having the case recharge the earbuds keeps them fresh so I haven't had any issues with them dying on me. Also the connection between my phone and the earbuds seems to be very strong. No issues like I've experienced with another brand.",5,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"I purchased these headphones on a whim a few weeks ago, after becoming frustrated with dealing constantly breaking wired headphones and lightning-3.5mm adaptors. So far I have been consistently satisfied with my purchase. The sound quality has so far surpassed my expectations, similar or better than most wired alternatives if used in the price range. I also enjoy the Bluetooth range, which I estimate to be about 20-30 feet. It's nice to be able to move around the house or work out without having to constantly carry my phone around. The battery life has also performed as advertised; about 3.5 hours sounds about right, and it will last much longer in stand-by mode outside if its case as well. Speaking of the case, the charging case is excellent; time to full charge is fast and the case is small enough to carry easily in a pocket or gym bag.The only concern I have with the earbuds is that they are more prone to fall out than my old wired headphones, Especially when wearing hats, changing clothing, or a heavy workout. However, I may simply need to experiment with the other provided earbud sizes to find the proper fit.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"After using these everyday for 2 months I’m disappointed in the longevity of the ear buds. The sound quality is good. I can hear the production very well and distinguish highs/lows. Noise cancellation is great IF you get them all the way in your ears. The ear buds are starting to cut out after only two short months. I haven’t tested them in the water. Battery on lasts 3 hours with constant non-stop (active) use.  Both earbuds have audio at all times, meaning if you take one ear buds out, they both stay on. Great start but needs improvements.",2,1,2019-4-20,1,0,0
"First let me say the sound quality is great, the range u can be away from ur phone is not. Also they sometimes would glitch and stutter the sound. My case would be charged but the buds would not always charge so they would die quickly, also I have had these less than 2 months and I now can not touch the ear bud to pause or start, they just shorted out all of a sudden and so in order for me to pause or what ever I have to do it by my phone, so sad, I loved these when I first got them but they didn't last very long.",2,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"These work fairly well. Sound is good for the price. Battery life is ok. Biggest issue is when it says, ""low battery please charge"" & then repeats itself every 5 seconds in case you forgot. You can't use them with a ""low battery"" because of the pointless, repeating warning. They're headphones, not a fire alarm.  That warning also comes on when the battery level for the headphones shows on my phone as being 20%.

I LOOOOVE these wireless earbuds!I got then in the color khaki and they're beautiful in person. AMAZING quality for the price point. They sync very easily to any device and the sound it's crystal clear (I love listening to music with bass and THESE DO IT FOR ME lol).,5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"I love how they fit in my ear and the fact its lightweight and easily hidden. The earpieces it came with didnt cancel any noise for me and kept sliding iut so I got some foam ear pieces. My problem is that my Left side seems to have sync problems when I'm walking and continues to go in and out while walking, jogging, mowing the grass or even sitting at my desk. Using them individually is fine but, when the L and R are synced and using the R's connectivity they dont seem to be working staying in sync.Update: I'm very disappointed with the earphones because now I cannot get the two to work together. (I mean that the right being the main isnt controlling the left anymore). Their arent any instructions to get them to work again and I have now emailed the manufacturer with no response to a fix. I can only use them individually now. For the amount of money, I would expect a device that works as well as a response if there was an issue.",1,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"Can’t beat the value for the price.  I was looking for a replacement for my beats X for gym, I wasn’t going to spend another $100-$200 on a pair of wireless earbuds.  These were featured and they’ve been working extremely well.  IPX 7 rating and battery life with the wireless charging case.  You can’t go wrong for the price either.  I bought 2 pairs",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"I have tried several wireless earbuds before trying these and I have to say I am very happy. They stay in my ears, they connect easily and don’t become disconnected randomly. Make sure you use the different size buds to see which is the best fit for you, because I preferred the smallest ones and it really changes how well they stay in. Also, I bought the khaki hoping it would be more like a rose gold as pictured, but it’s not. It’s definitely khaki. Would have chosen a different color, but the description is correct so no harm there. Great product.",5,1,2020-5-29,1,1,0
"I'd rather pay twice as much for a good pair and save money than throw away $50. I have no time to return these.The main reason for one star is left ear plugs does not charge, I put them on charge for a full night and the left one says low battery please charge.",1,1,2019-8-7,1,1,0
"I use these at work every day. The battery will last me about 4 hours on a full charge, so it doesnt quite make it to lunch.You also cannot use each bud independently. You can use only the right bud or both the left and right buds, but not just the left bud.",4,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"I love the TOZO T10. The sound is great (surprising bass for such a small package), and at a very affordable price. Setup was very easy and the charging time is short.  I find the TOZO T10 comfortable to wear. Noise cancellation is very good. In making and receiving phone calls the sound is good on both ends for indoor conversations. I haven't tested outside in windy conditions yet. I've already recommended these to several family members and friends.",5,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"I am quite impressed with this pair of earbuds. First, the sound is great. There's a good balance of bass, the mids, and the highs. The low frequencies do not drown out the mid and high's. Second, the earbuds are water resistant. One of the earbuds accidentally fell into my sink that had about 1/2 water in it. I picked it up after it was emersed in water, dried it with a towel and it still works! So, I don't worry about the earbuds going bad after walking several miles on my treadmill. Third, the earbuds can be charged in a charger that has wireless charging capability. I don't have to repeatedly insert into the charger the micro USB cable that comes with the earbuds. Fourth, when I'm done listening, I put the earbuds back into the charger and they automatically turn off and disengage from my iphone/ipad/macbook pro mid-2012. I have not tried other earbuds, but I'm quite satisfied with these earbuds based on the reviews and how the product has been functioning thus far.",5,1,2019-6-13,1,0,0
"I should have ordered this pair earbuds long time ago. I was in process to purchase more expensive brand and I am glad I didn't, this has saved me some $$$!After unpacking the earbuds automatically paired with my iPhone X. The sound in my opinion is clear and crisp, the only complain I have, I can't hear my surroundings especially when my wife calls LOL! (sarc)The earbuds fit snug and surprisingly soft without any pressure inside my ear channel.",5,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"They're decent, sound quality is decent, but these earbuds are shaped like trash and will slip out of your ear 30 times in an hour. If you start to sweat, the earbuds slip out. If you do any movements where you bend your head (deadlift) these will star to slip off. Any vibration (running) will cause these to slip out your ear.2/5 at best do not recommend.",2,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
"Rare for me to leave a product review but sadly in this case I felt it was warranted.  Initially, a very positive experience with these earbuds - nice packaging and design.  As others noted, recharging case is a little on the plasticky side but it does the job.  Set up was straightforward with my iphone (although read instructions about just pairing right earbud).  Overall, sound quality was pretty darn good - particularly in the bass range.  Apart from some occasional syncing issues with the left earbud, the first week went great until it didn't.  Left earbud issues increased until it just stopped working altogether.  I'll be sending these back and verdict is still out on whether I'll do an exchange or go in another direction.",2,1,2019-4-2,1,1,0
"I was skeptical when I bought these but I needed a really good pair to keep me going on my long runs. At first, my phone had trouble sustaining a connection but I realized it was because your phone needs to be on the right side of your body because the right earbud is the receiver. After I figured that out, I haven't had anything but good things to say for months. As with any wireless earbud, be very attentive to how loose the earbuds are cuz once they fall out, you may never find them again. Get the insurance, cuz when (not if but when) one falls out and you lose it, the insurance will replace them both.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0

El sonido es nítido, lo único que pienso que hace falta para una próxima versión es que se pueda subir y bajar el volumen, y por ende que se pueda adelantar o regresar a una canción. Pese a este plus que es necesario, me parece un excelente artículo por el precio que se paga por este!",5,1,2019-11-7,1,2,0
I love these earbuds. I use one at a time and they last for 4 hours. When one dies I recharge and use the other. I actually ordered a second pair for home. Original was for my office. I listen to music and podcasts all day. I can also answer my phone when it rings. The only thing it doesn’t do it advance to next song. Not problem because I keep phone close.

"First let me say I am a Bose fan to the end.  But if would have got these first I would not have a set of Bose.  These sound great, contect easy and stay in my ears which usually is a problem for me with this type of earbud.  Full range of sound from highs to lows.The only issue for me is if you just use one, for about a minute it beeps to let you know it is looking for the other to connect to.  One of the reviews I read said this but it is really not a big beal to me.",4,1,2019-7-8,1,0,0
My  TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds are the second pair that I have purchased after losing my first ones. I would totally recommend them because of the cost/benefit dilemma.One my second pair I had a malfunction and decided to contact TOZO Customer Service. They replied in a matter of hours offering to send a new pair totally cost free. It is hard to find this type of service. I would absolutely recommend to purchase this earbuds.

"I have been wanting a great pair of wireless earbuds that I can rely on for a long time without breaking the bank, and I was not disappointed by the Tazo T10.  Since they have arrived, I have used them daily.  The sound quality is wonderful and they do a wonderful job of blocking out background noise.  I also have daily zoom meeting, so they are a great, discrete way for me to not be tethered to my computer.  I also like that I can pair just one of the earbuds to my devices if I desire.  The customer service is also top-notch and reliable.  I had a question about one of my earbuds, and they responded immediately with helpful and kind service to help me solve my query.  I was so satisfied with the product, I have purchased a pair for my wife and my in-laws.",5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"Absolutely bought a pair of  air pods, hated That they kept falling out my ear . These TOZO 10 are the truth!!! Very fitting & doesn’t even fall out of my ear, not even when I’m jump roping haha, very easy to use and the packing is very nice.The sound on these are absolutely amazing & the noise cancellation is wonderful!! Over all I give them all 5’s!! Definitely will suggest buying things for way less than the Apple ones. These are so much better!! Don’t wait, buy it and enjoy them yourself.",5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"This is a brief update on my past review. After submitting my unsatisfied review earlier, this company made their best effort to contact me, sent me a replacement and made sure I changed my mind in regards to their newer much more improved product which is way better than this version. The only issue now is the fact that the new headphones have very low volume and I doubt theres anything they can do about it.",4,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0
"The setup on these could not possibly be easier -- I had them connected to my iPhone and playing perfectly within about a minute flat. Both the earbuds themselves and the charging box feel quite solid. I don't have a wireless charging station, so I can't speak to how that feature works. Pausing/playing by clicking the center of the earpiece works seamlessly, as does accepting incoming phone calls. Same with the built in microphone -- my caller said they couldn't tell I was on a Bluetooth device. And while I'd love a bit more bass, at this price point the sound quality is pretty darn good. Very satisfied!",5,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"I purchased these, and then sent them back.  The range of the Bluetooth is about 2 feet line of sight.  If you put your phone in your pocket the signal keeps dropping.  They also fell out of my ears easily.  A few times I had to turn them on and off because the left ear would not sync with the right ear.  Maybe I just got a bum set but this is what I got.",2,1,2019-4-28,1,1,0
"Ok I had written a previous review about liking them but they didn't fit my ears so they would fall out. Now I'm being HARASSED by the company to delete my review and they will give me a Amazon gift card. What?! The person was all ""I'll get fired if you don't delete it and I'm Chinese so I didn't have a job for awhile"". I wish I was making this up! The product itself is ok. My husband really likes them. But the service. Hard pass",1,1,2020-4-9,1,1,0
"Great product!  I didn't expect this type of quality from bluetooth earbuds.  It works better than my wired head phones.  The sound is outstanding with its bass.  I use these for work and for working out.  When working out these never fall out when i'm running on the treadmill or just lifting weights.  It says last about a few hours per charge, but I used it for work a few times and I got 6 hrs of usage with the headphones still showing 25% left.  These are way louder and crisper than my other earbuds I have.  I can tell the difference between these bluetooth earbuds and my other ones.  The sound is clearer and louder.  The case having wireless charging is also a big plus!  The only thing  I will say that could be improved on atm is the case that holds the earbuds, its just all plain black.  I would've loved like a TOZO logo or something to show off :P.  Will definitely buy again and recommend to others.",5,1,2019-4-25,1,0,0

"its ok,but it does not come with extra ear buds for the different ear sizes like in the add, contacted co and you have to reply with all this info like i am trying to waste my time to get free ear caps. NO GOOD .also its kind off heavy to the ear and not sure its a good choice if you are using them for running . i will say it goes dead after about 6hrs of use and they are bulky so if you have small ears or drum its gonna stick out or fall out",3,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"The earbuds were packaged very well but still easy to open up.  They IMMEDIATELY began to function as soon as I removed them from the case; pairing them with my phone was pretty much automatic.  The sound quality is very good; I just got them so I can't address battery life at this point.  I've got to trade out the tips to get a better fit for my left ear, but it looks like noise cancellation will be quite good.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"I was skeptical about a product at this price point but the reviews had me sold. I received these, it was easy to pair and they worked right away.

I think I figured it out, but it isn't as easy as I thought it would be. Overall though, I highly recommend it.",4,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"God made these headphones and then made AirPods as a joke. These babies are unbelievably comfortable, they look adorable, and the sound is impeccable.

These headphones are great! I've never owned a pair of bluetooth headphones it's amazing how little I miss the wired ones. I can walk all around my house leaving my phone behind.

"I'm really impressed with the earbuds. The sound quality is excellent and they fit well in my ears with various sizes of ear adapters to get the right fit. They're easy to connect to bluetooth, and I love not having to deal with an audio wire.  They're especially good for the price, given apple earbuds $200 price tag.  I would give it 5 stars; however, the charger usb cord that comes with it is too short - maybe 8 inches long, so it makes it too short to charge in most places, plus the plug in adapter is for a samsung, not iphones. Overall a good solid product.",4,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
I really like these headphones. I’m surprised at how well they perform for this price point. I had really expensive Beats headphones and I lost them. I was looking for something that can do the job but wasn’t as expensive. So when I checked on amazon I found these and was pleased with the reviews for it.  I decided to give this a try and was very satisfied. They play loud and clear and do a better job than the more expensive beats. I love these!!,5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"Pro: great price, comfortable and relatively easy to use. Does an excellent job of canceling out other noises and sound pretty darn good. Usually have pretty good phone call quality as well.CONS: the ear piece is turned off but seems to turn back on in the charger and effectively, not charge.

I'm glad a lot of reviews mentioned the bass quality which helped to make a decision. Being wireless is wonderful, no longer will I have to struggle with the cord getting caught on the workout machines at the gym. Only had it for less than a week and so far so good. Not sure about the battery life yet but seem to stay strong for at least 3 hours. This being my first time with wireless earbuds I have to say I am pleased with everything so far. They pair easily, have a nice charging case, and seem to fit my ear without falling out when running. I was quick to receive the shipment and the product packaging was great.

The portable charging case is good quality and built better than I originally expected. The lid for the case is magnetic and the earbuds are magnetic as well, so you don't have to worry about them falling out of the case. I wish the battery life was a bit longer, but they charge pretty fast. Battery life is about 3 hours for music and 5 hours for phone calls.

The ear piece would stay in while jumping, walking, and running. But then at random times, it'd fall out of my ears, even when standing still. One fell out of my ear and down the drain while I was brushing my teeth, so now I've gone back to wired Bluetooth headphones.",3,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"This was a great purchase for what I'm looking for in inexpensive earbuds. Very good sound quality. I've only tried one other pair ( apple styled soundpeats ) which were actually very good but lacked the bass quality I was looking for. I settled on the Tozo T10 because of the number of reviews. Not disappointed one bit. Keep in mind these are not audiophile quality, but they do the job very well. The other reason was because I could select which earbud to listen through which the soundpeats only allows listening thru the right earbud. All in all I would recommend this for gym or casual listening as they stay in my ears very well.",4,1,2019-8-8,1,0,0

So I ended up losing my Samsung ear buds which were not cheap yet alone an anniversary gift from my wife.  I then decided to search and purchase the best and most affordable ear buds i could find.

IMO these are hands down the best set of ear buds out there.,5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,1
"For $40, the sound quality is decent. But I have to say I was let down by the battery life of the case. It has about two full charges of the earbuds. For me this requires me to charge the case everyday.Also, when the battery on the earbuds get low, it will start warning you 5 mins or so prior to completely dying out which is not enough time imo. Once the first warning starts, it will tell you that the battery is low every minute or so which is annoying and unnecessary, and it will die about 5 mins after the first warning.",2,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0

I use them for my meditations, listening to music in the office, listening to audio books, etc.  As for battery life it's ok, sometimes it dies on the middle of my day but it charges fairly quickly and when not using I charge the box on a wireless charger.  Very easy to pair and it doesn't disconnect out of nowhere. So far so good!!",5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0

I wasn’t expecting the best sound quality but I sure wasn’t expecting the worst either. Holy guacamole these produce tinny and one dimensional sounds.

They’re comfortable and don’t fall out even when I’m running. Not to mention they’re water proof! I wear these all day at work and you never even feel them in your ear! They’re REALLY comfortable!

These are so worth the investment, especially since they are so stylish! Definitely recommend!!",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
I’ve never had wireless buds before but have tried my daughter’s air pods as I was thinking of getting those and these are much better.  I didn’t like how hers fit and after awhile were uncomfortable.  I like how you can change the ear piece to fit your ears specifically.  Very comfortable and I don’t feel like they are in my ears.  I’m using them as I write this review and definitely block out background noise greatly.  My daughter is in a zoom call with her college class right next to me and not hearing anything of what they are discussing.  Definitely happy with these and glad I took the chance!,5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
I am amazed at the quality if these earbuds fir under $40.  The pairing process was so easy and so quick.  The build of the buds is solid.  The fit is perfect and the case is a plus especially with the wireless charge feature.  Now when I actually played my first track I was blown away with the audio quality.  The lows popped and the highs were clean.  Bluetooth range from device is just excellent.My son tried them and wants a pair so I am ordering a second pair fir him.  These are amazing earbuds!!  Tozo has a winner with the T10.,5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"I've had them for about 3 weeks now. I use them everydsy for about 2 hours. I did not have to put the pack on charge for 3 weeks. No lie! People seem to hear me fine as well. I like that they come with smaller adapters too because I have small ear holes. Fits nicely!Update 2020: I have accidentally washed and dried these, first couple times they still worked.  3rd time the microphone went out. 4th time one head phone stopped making sound. Pretty good quality in my opinion. Also, dont wash them lol",5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0
"I have a pair of the ""expensive"" brand and these Tozo headphones blow them out of the water hands down! Had them about a year now and they still hold a good charge (few hours of straight music). The charging case still charges them 3-4 times. Bass is phenomenal. Volume can go HIGH. Low profile so they fit in my motorcycle helmet. Literally no complaints! Buy them!",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,1
"I have been impressed with these earbuds. I had to change out the plugs because I have freakishly odd shaped ears, but they stay in my ears, better than the ones I had that wrapped around my ears. I use these for working out and part of that is running on a treadmill. These stay put. Also, pairing with my iPhone is easy.  The only complaint I have is when I lay to do ab workouts one of the earbuds cut out. It’s not a huge deal to me though.",4,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
I just go these yesterday. I have used many ear buds in the past but got these on sale.I wanted a set that the case itself could be wirelessly charged.,5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"There are quite a few wireless buds available online and, like other reviews, I wasn’t sure which would be a good alternative to high priced options. I selected the TOZO 10 based on the literal thousands of reviews and good feedback. These things are great! The packaging is professional, warranty is a simple QR code and then in a few clicks you’re registered. The devices fit perfectly and the charger is pretty unique as it doubles a carrier and comes with a lanyard. If you’re going to spend $50, these are the ones to spend it on. You could spend more but honestly, you’re going to get a very good experience with these and the customer service is excellent from a thank you acknowledgment to quick receipt when you submit the warranty. You’re going to like these!",5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"I’ve tried several ear buds, and these are by far the best one.  A lot of the ear pods come in a standard size, which may not fit your ears depending on whether they are too big or too small for your ears.  But these come with a few different fitting so that you can chose the right size to fit snug in your ear.  With that, you drastically decrease any unwanted noise.  The sound is great quality is great, and loud, if that’s how you want it.  The battery life is long enough to complete several task with out them dying.  I use them working out, cutting grass, and at work when I’m starting loud pieces of equipment that I usually wear ear buds for.  Using these for a replacement of earplugs are not the intended use, but they work just as well to me.",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"It constantly falls out of my ears. I’ve tried changing the sizes of the ear piece, so far it doesn’t stay put. Also I have to pair it to my phone each time I need to use it. It doesn’t reconnect easily. I always have to forget the device and search for it again. This app is a pain.... I really like the sound quality but the other issues takes away from the product.",2,1,2020-10-5,1,0,0
"I like these a lot for listening to music or watching a movie, but don't even TRY to use them for phone calls. No one can hear me at all no matter what I've tried, even in my quiet room, they are useless for conversations. I do find them to have a good bass response and they are good for exercising and entertainment. Wish the battery life was better, but I think they are OK.",3,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"These earbuds have excellent sound quality, especially for the price. They're easy to use and the instructions are very clear.  There are four sizes of the silicone earpieces to choose from.  I haven't used it for phone calls yet, but for playing music they are very nice, and you don't have to turn the volume up high on your phone or anything to get a nice sound.  They're easy to charge and come with a charging cable, the case, the earpiece tips, and a strap so you can put the case around your neck if needed.  I would definitely recommend these.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"Ok, so this is my second pair of Tozo earbuds. My first pair last countless drops, several runs through the washer and dryer, and a teething toddler. I’m pretty sure there was nothing about them being water proof but boy did they hold up.It’s easy to make another purchase from their company as my first pair took a beating. They make a quality affordable product.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,1
Just got these in today. Sound is great. They don’t feel loose or like they will fall out and that’s with the default medium ear caps (tried the smalls ones but they were too loose). Don’t know about battery life yet as I just got them. Very happy that these came with a charging cable (the ones these are replacing didn’t) and excited about the prospect of wireless charging.,5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"I used these headphones when I’m working in the office and when I’m working out: cardio, running, lifting. I would not recommend these to a friend. My biggest issue is the battery life. Even when the bud is properly seated in its case and disconnected from all devices, they are still on. I have reverted back to my wire headphones because these are never charged when I go to use them. My other issue with these is how poorly they fit in my ears. Even with the properly sized cushions, they still protrude. I often have to readjust them to stop them from falling out every 10 minutes. Finally, I’ve found that they often disconnect from one another, cutting out the audio in one pod for a few seconds.I’m to the point where I purchased a pair of Skull Candy pods because I can’t rely on these.",1,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"Initially purchased in August 2019, sound quality was intermittent. Used with an Apple 4 watch on morning walks, I had to hold my arm still to hear sound in the left ear bud. After several weeks buds refused to charge. Contacted Customer Support, explained my problem in detail, and TOZO quickly provided replacement ear buds. So far, the replacement buds work as advertised--sound is good in both ears. No issues charging.I am especially appreciative of TOZO's customer support to ensure that all customers are satisfied with their product.",5,1,2019-9-27,1,0,0
"This product worked great for the first few months, but barely holds a charge now. The earbuds die within 20 minutes even if just pulled from a fresh charge. The lights on the charging case don't light up anymore, pretty much useless. You get what you paid for...$50 for almost a year of Bluetooth ear bud usage. 3 stars overall for sound quality and simplicity.",3,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"SO FAR, this product is exactly what it says it is.  However I'v bought these kind of devices in the past, after few months of use you start realizing their ""buggs"".  As of yet don't see anything wrong with them even call quality (and i'm pretty much deaf in my left ear) is amazing, best I have ever experienced.  Music quality is like no other, bass is so amazing I was impressed!! So over all AGAIN SO FAR, this product is really, really good!!  I will continue this review in about 3 months if I find any crap with these.",5,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0
"Update: the right earbud stopped working and the charging case doesn’t shut off at all. I would not by these... I thought they were good but now they don’t work at all.I went through three pairs of blue tooth headphones from FYE.

"I received my new TOZO T10 earbuds today, and just spent three delightful hours listening to a nice variety of music. My initial thoughts are that these are very impressive earbuds, especially at their affordable price point !My ""everyday"" earbuds are the Apple AirPods Pro, and I wanted an additional pair of buds to wear in my pool, without worrying about water damage.  After several ""Google searches"" and after reading many Amazon reviews,",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"Just received my new set of earbuds from Tozo, and i have to admit i'm surprised at how good these sound.  They linked up quickly to my phone, came with about a half charge on the charging station and full on the earbuds.  My preferences in sound tend to lean towards a mix of punchy bass and rich mids, the highs can be overpowering for me, but on this set they're just right.  My last set was a bass boosted set from a competitor that i enjoyed quite a bit, until i ran them over. Noise cancellation is pretty good, getting the fit correct is important as i noticed with different earbud tips that it changed the richness pretty drastically, but once you find that sweet spot on fit, the sound is fantastic.  I would recommend these buds to my friends for sure, and the price point made me feel like i basically got away with something dastardly.  My wife got a chance to listen to them too, and will be ordering a set. Sound-5/Noise Cancellation 4/Battery Life 4.  Awesome buds TOZO!!",5,1,2020-3-15,1,0,0

"Great wireless ear buds for the price. It is critical to get the right fit for the pads, but once fitted properly the sound is great. Battery discharges within a week if left in the case (disconnected from the device) but overall I’m very happy otherwise. So happy, in fact, that I bought a second pair and my wife also bought a set (so 3 sets altogether)!",5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"I returned by jabra elite 65t for these things. The jabara was better at noise canceling, but phone calls were terrible. Constant echo's.I turned to the TOZO T10 after a random encounter on Amazon. And I can say that it's an easy replacement. I've used these for music, working out and phone calls. With the latter being my main use case for work.  The battery life could be a bit better, but it's a moot point since I can charge it up rather quickly.  These are a must have at the price point.",5,1,2019-4-8,1,0,0
"I finally broke down and decided to get a pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds.  I was overwhelmed by the seemingly endless choices on Amazon, but settled on the TOZO T10s after seeing so many 5-star reviews and the price (I even got them delivered a day earlier than expected).I walk a mile from the train station to my office and back every day and am very satisfied with this product.  The sound is full and clear with just enough bass to compliment the other instruments rather than drown them out.  The fit is excellent (I recommend taking the time to find the right tips before making any judgements) and the sound isolation is good enough that I can hear my music or podcasts clearly without being completely cut off from my surroundings.  The fact that they are waterproof is a nice feature, which is why I purchased a pair for my fiancee (she uses them for her workouts and is quite happy with them as well).",5,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0
"The product itself works very well. I like that there are different size ear buds to fit everyone’s individual comfort level. The sound quality is also very good. I gave three stars because after less than 2 months of moderate use, the right earbud has stopped working. It won’t even power on for me to attempt a reset. I use it 3-4 times a week while at work, and never under water. It’s fallen from my ear maybe twice, but not significantly enough to cause any damage. So for the short term and the price, it’s a good product, but it doesn’t last long.",3,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"I was really excited for these earbuds. I checked the reviews and they looked promising, so I caved and ordered them.Once my package arrived, I noticed it was substantially larger than what I'd expect for a small box of earbuds. I picked it up and my heart dropped as I heard my brand new earbuds just sliding around, slamming on the sides of the box. Once I opened it, there was absolutely no padding inside. Just this tiny box of earbuds. So right off the bat I wasn't too happy due to poor packaging. Luckily, the earbuds didn't look damaged. I charged them for a bit before I paired them to my phone, which was quick and easy.",2,1,2019-2-27,1,0,0
"I loved these buds when I first got them, then I had trouble pairing them together.  I wound up sending back ccv to Amazon and received a new pair. Thus far after 2.5 months of use they work great. I originally bought 3 pair for me and my family.  My daughter's worked great from Christmas till a couple days ago. Couldn't get them to pair. Wrote to Tozo and received a response 24 hours later.  I did as the instructions said and perfect her buds are back in action pairing together.  The sound is great. Battery life is at least 4 hrs.

"I know it's a little early since I only used for a couple times, but so far so good. Wanting the free wireless charger so here we go. Bass is very good, volume can get loud and it stays in ears very comfortably. I am worried about the charge life since the battery case is at 1 light after 2 uses. I hope it does not suffer from same situation as the Gear Icon X did with their charger where it continually charges the earphones and drains the charge case.",5,1,2019-9-7,1,0,0

"Priced right. Received quickly. Still having difficulty keeping them in my ears, even though several size buds are included. When I am out walking I like to listen to music but when I perspire these ear buds slip out occasionally. This is not good if you are running or walking over areas where they can fall into a stream along a path or into deep grass. I almost lost one in the dark. I had been running at dusk because it tends to be cooler when the sun is setting here in Florida. Thank goodness, I saw the tiny light it was emitting .I tried a few sizes, but have not found a secure fit.~ Maybe..It is my ear shape? I am not certain. Otherwise, they are worth the money.",3,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0

I absolutely love these earbuds. My man bought 2 pairs and we enjoy them so much we actually turn up in our own little worlds lol. They’re great for their price. My oldest actually has the AirPods and I like these better and the AirPods hurt my ears and these are super comfy and fit. Don’t fall out while I work out too! And I usually can’t turn it up more than half the volume without it being too loud for me and it will block out every noise around you :) I hope this was helpful for everyone else that wants to buy them. You won’t be disappointed. I went based off reviews too. Enjoy!,5,1,2020-4-23,1,1,0
"So, these things went above and beyond my expectations. You can’t get much better than this for the price! The noise-cancellation function is great. I can’t hear anything but my music. The sound quality is pretty great - much better than my basic iPhone headphones. The also have pretty decent bass, too! And the best part is the battery life! I listened to just 1 all day at work (8hrs) for 5hrs straight on medium volume and it didn’t go dead. Charged it on my lunch break and it lasted the rest of the say. Also, I work in a very fast-past environment and these withstood all of the fast movements, running and sweating and never fell out.

I like that they're easy to pair and connect. I like how small they are and the fact that you have no wires or anything hanging around your neck is great. The only thing is that at times it just stops playing. Sound quality isn't great but I don't mind since most of the time I'm listening to podcasts anyhow. Overall for the price I'm happy with what I got. Don't go into this expecting Bose quality at bargain prices. Charging is quick and easy. Battery life is about 4 hrs.,3,1,2019-7-18,1,0,0
I bought these instead of AirPods because I have trouble with them staying in my ear when I walk/jog. So I went for a jog the first time using and one popped out when I got a lite sweaty and the champagne color I chose blended with the dirt. Couldn’t find it:( other than that I think the battery life and quality are nice. I’m wondering if I can get just the right earbud replacement now?????,3,1,2020-8-6,1,1,1
"Tozo.  Come on.  If I haven't used these earbuds in a few weeks, why do they connect to my phone out of the blue, while they're sitting in their case???I suppose it has something to do with the battery level getting low and maybe them turning themselves on and auto connecting, but that's something that should have been fixed before selling them to customers.",1,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
I love this cheaper alternative to the apple airpods. the sound quality is sooo much better and the noise cancellation is impeccable. a lot of times people around me would be talking to me and i couldn't hear a thing! I loved this product so much that i got my sister her own pair.the only thing i hope they might be able to change in their next model is to be able to turn the charging case on and off so the earbuds are not being charged everytime i put it back in the case. because sometimes i only use the earbuds for 10 minutes or shorter.  another thing i hope they might be able to modify is to be able to use the earplugs individually. a lot of times i want to go out with one of the earplugs so i can at least hear people around me (because the noise cancellation is soo good with both on) but I am not able to use one of them alone because of the beeping that happens if you put one if them back in the case. the only way i can use one of them is when i put the other earbud in my pocket but i am always afraid of losing that earbud.,5,1,2019-8-9,1,0,0
"I bought these to replace a slightly cheaper pair that had a tinny sound and no bass.  FANTASTIC!  Buy 'em, you won't be disappointed unless you are a stone-cold audiophile, in which case you should be a different price point.

I've had other earbuds that feel like they should have better quality, but don't fit very well. These ones have fit fine though.Only con is that you can't get too far from your phone, but it's fine for my purposes.

I work in a call center that can have a lot of downtime between calls and was able to use mine since I received them on 4/21 and didn't have to charge them again until 4/26.

I couldn't hear my husband playing his video games in the other room nor one of our dogs barking. Sound quality was great, no skipping or anything like that. Today I took an hour long walk with these on. The entire time the left speaker would just go out on me even when I stopped to pair it back to my phone.

The biggest annoyance for me is the ear fit - I don't think I can keep these in for longer than a minute before one of them falls out. That could be just my ears, so the fit might be okay for others.

"Overall for the price, they're good headphones. I wanted to just cover some of the issues I ran into. 1st was connectivity. I found it was sometimes spotty, however this may have been to the location i work at. 2nd and this may be due to the layout of my ears, but I found it difficult to really keep them in. Tried all the sizes for the buds that came with it too. Lastly the battery charger doesnt turn off. So if you're done using the headphones for the day and you store them in the case. It'll recharge them, but, it will continue charging them until the case itself dies and then in turn drains the headphone battery life.

The only thing I will say the battery life isn't what I was looking for for 3.5 hrs compared to other wireless ear buds that can last for +5 hrs just for the buds for themselves or 34hrs with the buds and the case. But the earbuds are really good if you are looking for an inexpensive wireless product.",3,1,2019-7-1,1,0,0
I liked the product a lot at the beginning but now it’s May and the sound is fine but the microphone on each ear bud is bad. It echoes terribly and the reason why I bought it has been negated. The sound quality again is great but the microphone leaves something to be desired.

"I purchased these headphones after the death of my previous sets of wired headphones in a series of cat-related cord-chewing disasters: quite frankly, I had been avoiding bluetooth headphones due to the cost and because I expected the sound quality of reasonably priced wireless headphones to be poor.Given the reviews on this product, I bit the bullet and made the $50 purchase, and I'm honestly very glad I did. The headphones themselves were relatively comfortable straight out of the box, but were better once I changed the earpieces. They stay in well; I haven't had them fall out while running, mowing, or working, and they are IPX8 so I also haven't had any issues with sweat or moisture. The noise cancellation of the headphones is also wonderful, as it's hard to hear anything with them in. This could be alternately a blessing or a curse depending on what you're doing, but they worked so well that I can't deduct anything from them for being well designed.",5,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
So far so good! I hesitated to purchase wireless ear buds but working from home has made them necessary. I got these in the mail today and they were very easy to set up.

Still sceptical, I went ahead and purchased these with the amazing price knowing now what I get out of these ear buds.One of the first things I did after unboxing was figure out the perfect size for me and I'm glad i did. The Bluetooth is unbeatable! I absolutely hate being locked in one spot if I don't want to lug my phone around at the gym. (Might as well still have a cord) Walking to go get water across the gym was no problem with no disconnection. The capability of starting and stopping music with both the left and the right ear buds came in handy on multiple occasions. One thing I was surprised about was the sound quality and the noise cancellation capability. I've been through so many headphones and ear buds from high end brands to knock offs and always seemed to be disappointed with some aspect of them from sounds quality to Bluetooth connection. One last thing i will highlight on would be the battery life and charging box. I couldnt beleive how long these lasted and how quick they recharge in a pinch. Overall these ear buds from Tozo has checked every box for me and easily became my go to for everyday/ every occasion use.",5,1,2019-9-19,1,0,0
This product (T10)  was great in all respects except you can't control either Volume or Multimedia.I have the other more recent one (T6)and it allows you to control both Vol and Mult. Problem is that it operates on touch. When I take a shower or on a windy day it becomes unusable.,3,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
Just got them. Amazed at the comfort and sound of them. Let's see how they last.Edit: had to return first because couldn't hear people on call. Disconnected these and used other Bluetooth and worked fine. So dault wasn't with the phone. They sent me another replacement and after a week did the same.,1,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"I have really enjoyed these earbuds. Once I found the correct size for my ear I could wear them anywhere. I have used them for working out and running with no worry of them falling out. I have used them in the shower with no worry because of the water resistance. I have even fallen asleep in them with no issues or pain when waking up.These earbuds have great sound quality and I use them for everything from country to rap, and even podcasts. I would recommend these to anyone wanting a good quality for the price.",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
Just received in mail today. Packaging was great and everything was present in the box. Easy to put in the ears and to charge. I am still playing with the earbuds to get use to them. I have yet to learn how to get both earbuds paired at the same time. So far...i have not been successful.**Update** Been using for a week now an i have learned how to have both earbuds on at once! Definitely utilize them while cleaning or folding clothes! Highly recommend,5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,1
These earbuds are great. I wanted to pair of truly wireless earbuds because I travel some and needed a small Bluetooth option. I also wanted some that I could work out in for running and weight training and not get tangled up in wires or fall off/out if my ears. They work perfectly. They sound fantastic. I was honestly surprised at how good they sounded. They lean slightly to a heavier bass profile but for me I don't mind that. I highly recommend these.,5,1,2019-10-12,1,0,0
"It's been a fight with these ear buds. To get them to sync is a challenge. Now the right ear bud the primary device, is the only one working. Little tech support, but once that was exhausted and didn't work, I got a message that they would send out a replacement earbud that was the problem. All works now thank you guys for the great troubleshooting and follow through.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,1,0
"One of the earbuds fell into a bucket of water and was in there for about 30 minutes before I found it. Amazingly after I dried it off, it worked right away! I would give this product 5 stars but the charging case does not hold charge for very long, when it is fully charged, I can charge the earbuds only once before it is down to 1 bar. This is not too much of a problem as I use these at my desk at work so power is always near by.",4,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
Very good sound for the price. I gave it only 3 stars because after a week; the left bud started to drop out if I turned my head in a certain direction. It didn't matter what device I used. I have 2 Ipods (5th and 6th gen) and a Note 10+. They all did the same thing whether it was 5 inches away or 5 feet away. If I turned my head the wrong way the left would cut out for a second or more but come back. Other than that annoyance it sounds so much better and louder than the T6.,3,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"Genuinely impressed with the value here. I was looking for an affordable alternative to Apple AirPods. I tried and had to return a different company’s wireless buds first, because the sound quality was bad. A few months later, I picked up these Tozo earbuds and have to say I’m all around impressed. Solid sound quality, connected in 10 seconds, and the company seems to have put some effort into the entire presentation. Doesn’t feel cheap yet the price is the cheapest I’ve seen. I think these are hidden gems for the value.",5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
"I actually liked my new TOZO earbuds. I had Skullcandy SESH prior to that, but lost them. Decided to try something different.  TOZO worked well as far as sound quality, bass, comfort etc. The microphone was good for occasional phone calls. About a month later, right piece started acting up and would not reset. I contacted the seller and they went out of their way to address the issue. They apologized and send me a replacement set (which actually is an upgrade). Communication was prompt and direct.  Good seller!",4,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"They look great and work well HOWEVER, they are way too big for my ears. I am 5’5” 115 and average build. They fall out within seconds. The bud that goes in the ear is a bit large even with the smallest bud but the piece that should tuck in the ear crease is enormous. Will see if they fit my grown son as he is a 6’ 200 pound fellow. If they are too big for him we will return them.",4,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"Do these earbuds sound as good as true audiophile options?  Of course not.  But they sound awfully darn good, and they cost $30.  I wear them for running.  They are comfortable and stay in place.  I don’t have to worry about getting them wet.  The battery lasts a reasonable time and charges quickly.  It is important to make sure you have them fit properly.  The earpieces that came preinstalled fit fine in terms of holding the buds in place.  However, the sound quality was poor.  Too bright, too thin, no bass.  I tried the next larger earpieces.  They allowed the buds to fit more deep and snug into my ears.  This really opened up the sound.  I am very pleased with the buds.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
I don't understand how overwhelming positive the review of these ear buds is. These fall out of my ear after 15-20 minutes. The sound for phone calls is great and this is a productive tool to have for work. For music? No way - Garbage. I compared my traditional apple ear buds that came with my phone and other wireless head phones that I have and it is night and day. This product lacks the bass. Battery life is also not great. The price should be lower. After using these I should have just sprung for air pods and paid more. They look cool and the charging dock is nice.,3,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"Before I purchase this earbuds, my mind was everywhere to find the good and the best earbuds. Searching and keep searching finally I decided to purchase Tozo10 to give it a try since. But when I got it and try it out and this is the second day already, it was amazing, absolutely amazing. Fits my ears and also looks stunning. I really love it. Thank you once again. Will definitely recommend this to friends and family. 👍👍👍👍",5,1,2019-11-22,1,0,1
"After giving my daughter my first set of wireless earbuds I purchased these to utilize the wireless charging feature. The quality sound and build of the earbuds really surprised me. These are great earbuds! When I ride my stationary bike my ears get a little sweaty and occasionally the first set would fall out of my ear. (They were not made by Tozo.) The new set don't fall out so they don't disrupt my workout. Great sound, great fit and wireless charging for a reasonable price make me a happy customer.",5,1,2019-8-28,1,0,0
"There seems to be some kind of interference when I use it while riding bikes. The connection between the phones is very unstable and the sound fades very frequently. I use to ride shared bikes, that have an embedded GPS tracking. I don't know if the electronics embedded in the bikes are causing such interference. This problem doesn't happen when I'm walking.UPDATE: It is getting worse each day. Now it sometimes looses connection even when I'm walking, and when biking it is much worse. I already tried the reset a couple of times, but it doesn't improve anything.",1,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
Looking for something to use running that wouldn't slip out when the others always seems to fall out or there were too many wires getting tangled. After buying a number of pairs these seemed to fit the bill. They're lightweight enough to stay put and it's a good balance of sound quality and noise cancelling as I don't want to block out 100% of the traffic around me when I'm out on a hilly road and need to keep my wits about me. The carrying case was a definite bonus as it charges them too. The hardest part is testing all the various earbud combinations to figure out which size works best to keep them put. Winner Winner me!Update** After a week of using these I noticed the same quality issues other users faced where the sound cuts out intermittently. It's really quite annoying. I've done the troubleshooting but haven't been able to resolve the issue yet and may return these in the next week if the MFG isn't able to help.,2,1,2019-9-2,1,0,0
"I just received my new headphones in the mail and right away was very pleased with the look and presentation of the product. Also the feel and functionality were exceptional as well, easy to use and sounds great.  Being truly wireless is a great feature for me as I used them during my work and wires get caught easily so I love these earbuds.",5,1,2020-10-3,1,0,1
"I was looking for wireless headphones and didn’t want to spend a lot of money. I feel like not only did I get wireless headphones for a reasonable price but they are really good headphones. They were easy to set up and they had multiple sizes for the ears. I last earphones would always fall out, I had a slight smaller size on one ear than the other so they fit perfect.",5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"Fantastic headphones at a fraction of the cost of AirPods with just as much convenience. I wear them at work while doing my opening duties, I wear them at home while doing chores, I wear them watching tv late at night on the couch as they pair with my Amazon TV. They charge quickly and effortlessly in their case, and the case charges on a wireless charging pad. Super convenient and the sound quality is fantastic. Highly recommend.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"I think for the price, these really are a good deal. I use them because it's easier than plugging in a pair of wired headphones when I have to walk somewhere. Now, for you audiophiles, I have noticed that there is a slight crackling/clipping/cracking with SOME songs that feature more aggressive percussion. The level of crackle varies with some songs. For 8-bit and electronic stuff, it is 0, whereas with vocal and rock stuff, it is definitely noticable. Not a deal breaker for me, but still an issue if that matters to you.",4,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"*Update: I received a replacement pair which seem to work as intended. The representative at Tozo told me to keep the earbuds I already had, which saved me the hassle of returning them and also left me with a spare set of earbuds and a charging case. The second charging case I received seems to be a little wonky, the left earbud wiggles around a bit too much and if it moves it may switch back and forth between charging and pairing modes. This is a little annoying but since I had a functional case already I just put the new earbuds in the first case and called it a day. I'm upgrading my overall review to 4 stars because the second pair is functional, continues have great sound, comfort and ease of pairing, and the customer service was very good.*These earbuds and their charging case are well designed, comfortable, sound great with great volume for their size (tweak your eq to bring up the bass and make sure you get them deep into your ears to get the most out of low tones), and charge quickly. However, my first pair has problems with the sound in the left earbud sputtering and cutting out rather frequently. It's hard to tell if this is related to an unstable bluetooth connection or a physical defect, though it seems to happen most when I move around or adjust either earbud, leading me to believe they are somehow damaged. Customer service responded to me almost immediately, offering to replace them. I would like to give them a higher rating if my second set works properly because the sound, comfort and security in my ears are truly great for the price.",4,1,2019-6-8,1,0,0

"Don't come in expecting audiophile quality jams. You are buying a quality, cheap pair of wireless ear buds that work great at the gym. I use them 4 days a week and they come with me in the hot tub post workout. I get a random disconnect maybe once every other session and sessions last about 2 hours. It's very brief. I'd say if you are on the fence about a new pair of headphones, these are a great pic.",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"These sound good and are in fact waterproof, which is great.  I use them in the pool.  They are fairly comfortable - maybe not quite like AirPods, but they also don’t cost $200.  They look nice and feel pretty solid.  The first pair I received didn’t pair correctly (to devices, or each other), but the seller was super quick to replace them and the new ones work perfectly.",5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"Amazing sound! Noise cancellation is great. Extremely easy to connect to my Pixel 4XL. Sounds much better than my daughter's air pods in my opinion. I can't compare them to anything other than the air pods bc I was never really an earphone person to begin with, but they fit comfortably and I like the design better than that if the apple product ear buds. I got the Navy blue and they were $40.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,1
"I bought these earbuds about 2 months ago.  I love the sound quality and noise cancellation.  I use them mostly at the gym.  If I had reviewed them right after I got them, it would have been 5 stars.  Unfortunately in the last few weeks, they have started cutting in and out even when my phone is right next to me.  I have to constantly tap on them or preposition them to get them to stop.  It's VERY frustrating.  I don't know if that's usual for this item or I just happened to have a dud.Update:  When I made a return and requested a replacement, it was going to take 2 months to deliver the new ones.  I cancelled the order and now have no way to request a refund for the one returned.  I’m out $40.  Horrible experience with this company, the product and Amazon.",1,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"For the month they worked, they were nice for the price....then the main earbud that links the bluetooth functionality (R) stopped responding entirely out of nowhere so they were made completely unusable,right before christmas. Today January 7th I recieved a replacement pair agger reaching out and the pair I was sent was in different seperate packaging(sans charging case)and they refuse to link up to work no matter what I try.

Decided to give these a try and I am happy I did. These earbuds sound great with incredible bass. The fit in the ear canal is perfect. They are not loose when I am at the gym. I also love how the charging works when you place them in the case and you can either use the attached cord to plug them in or if you have a charging pad you can just place them on top and walk away. For the money you can't beat them in my opinion. Best earbud purchase to date!,5,1,2019-8-18,1,0,0
"My first bluetooth anything.  I purchased based on the reviews and am not disappointed.  I miss the bass from my corded over-the-ear headset but other than that, these earbuds are great!  ...And the price is reasonable.

I bought these for boyfriend for Christmas since he needed a new pair after losing one of his old wireless ear buds. He feels the sound is remarkable and clear. He generally uses them at work and loves how convenient they are. My boyfriend has a hands on job working at a car dealership so it’s perfect there are no chords getting in his way while listening to his music while working. Battery life is okay. He can get away with 2 full days worth of listening (He works a typical 8hrs; 8-5 job).Overall I’d say he is pretty satisfied with these headphones!,5,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0
"Looks great. Easy to set up. But I tried playing some videos games with them and the sound quality was terrible. It couldn't handle the constant gunfire or explosions. Which is okay, my plan wasnt to use them for games but it would have been nice if I could them for everything. They sounded okay when I turned the volume almost all the way down but what's the point then?And when they arent being used there is an odd noise kind of like feedback. I have sensitive hearing so that may not bother everyone.",4,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
"Sounds quality is decent but they are big and bulky. Working outside sweating, these things just fall out even after trying different size ear buds.

These are definitely going back.",1,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"Just bought these earbuds and am really enjoying them. They stay in very well and block sound well. The music comes through very clearly. They are waterproof, I tested them in the shower and ran the waterproof case under the faucet. I haven’t tested how much they can be submerged since Bluetooth doesn’t work underwater, but you don’t have to worry about accidental splashes.The Bluetooth between earbuds has enough range to stay connected when you have them in. The buttons control calls and play/pause. You can connect one earbud at a time without continuous beeping if you take them both out first.",5,1,2019-5-17,1,0,0
I don't have a wireless charger but that's OK since the earbuds came with a USB cable that can be used for charging.  The product comes with an assortment of ear piece covers so getting a good fit was no problem.

There is no strap connecting the earbuds together to get twisted or caught on something which I really like.,5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"When I first ordered these, the pair I received had a bit of crackling in the left ear, and the sound would cut out. I messaged the seller who quickly fixed the issue and issued me another pair.

"I was skeptical about purchasing these due to the price compared to others on the market. I’m glad I went with them! Absolutely great sound. It overpowers the local gyms music and is crisp and clear. Believe it or not has a decent bass hit to it as well. Charge time is pretty insane, I can plug them in literally for a couple minutes before leaving to the gym and they are charged up. As for falling out of the ear, I’d say 95% they stay in even when sweating. When I’m doing sit-ups at the end of my session they occasionally slip out. Also the cases charging port has a rubber boot that protects it when not in use. This thing is extremely difficult to get out to plug your charger into. Not that big of a deal at all... but worth mentioning. Overall excellent product and would buy again in a heart beat.",4,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
"This headset has a very powerful bass that rivals AirPods and is stronger than Jabra. The phone call was also very clear. I bought it for three days and found no problems. This price can buy such a wireless headset, very value! awesome! I really like it too much. If you want to buy a friend of wireless Bluetooth headset, this is it, bought it right.Additional comments： It took a while, and now I found that the left earphone connection is unstable and the connection is always dropped.So change five stars to three stars",5,1,2019-3-8,1,1,1
"Overall I’ve been extremely satisfied with this product . The sound quality is absolutely phenomenal and I love the bass inside that’s provided . I’ve tested it on all genres of music , and believe it you can hear the bass on all levels.  Terms of noise cancellation, the higher the sound the less and less you hear . However it does a pretty good job blocking out most noises . Now the battery life varies on the pods themself , and I mean that. While yes they can last up to two hours it merely depends on the output (sound) of how quickly they die . Terms of comfort they are very comfortable, but they tend to slide out if you’re to active .If I had any complaints about this device it’d be the battery doesn’t last long enough. There is also the fact they fall out from time to time . Wish they were a tad more snug when I ran . Other than that they’re perfect .",5,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"I recently had my (very expensive) pair of Powerbeat earbuds break recently, and not being a big fan of the Apple buds I went looking for a cheaper alternative. I was a bit skeptical of this product despite the number of postive reviews because of its price, but decided to give it a shot anyways. And now that I have it my, well, ears for about a week now I can safely say that it is completely worth the money!I was actually blown away at the sound quality of these earbuds, and putting them in pretty much blocks out any other sounds for me. Along with that, a constant problem I had with my Powerbeats is that they would constantly keep falling out of my ears despite having those odd (and apparently pretty fragile after said breakage) ear hooks. But these buds stay in my ears no matter if I'm jogging, going up stairs, doing jumping jacks, or whatever odd movements.",5,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0
"These earbuds are great, this is the second pair that I've purchased to replace others BECAUSE they operate independently. I've not found a pair of earbuds that have great battery life yet, with the others I have when the battery on one goes out, you can't use the second.

"So many great features on these, but unfortunately they didn't fit in my ears well, even the smallest ear cups. While seated at my desk they were great, and sounded decent for the price, but if I tried to eat with them in, the movement of my jaw muscles worked them out of my ears every time. I also found that during a 1 hour walk, I was constantly adjusting and pushing them back into my ears. I can attest to their waterproofness though, after one fell out of my ear and into the toilet, haha. I guess I just have freakishly small ear canals.",4,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
I love these buds! Great sound at a great price. Bought some for my wife too. In my original review I only gave 2 stars due to an issue with the earbuds my daughter purchased.

Definitely recommend these earbuds!,5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
I really like these earbuds. They are easy to pair to my phone. They stay in my ears (especially after using the correct earbud size) and the batteries seem strong. The case is very durable and charges easily by just plugging the USB to a computer. It can also be charged wirelessly; you have to buy the wireless charger separately though. The sound is awesome; you can hear the bass! The microphone is powerful. You don't have to speak loud to be heard during phone conversations. It's a good earbud to buy.,5,1,2019-8-15,1,0,0
"I've got to be honest, I almost never review an item on Amazon but these are just not worth the $40 I spent on them. To start with the positives, they do a pretty good job staying in my ears and form a decent seal for noise-isolation.The problem comes when you actually try to turn them on and try to listen to music. They are sort of finnicky when you take them out of the charging case. They take longer to pair than any other bluetooth product I own. The biggest flaw is the sound. The sound quality is not even half as good as the $7.99 wired earbuds these were replacing. There is no depth-of-sound whatsoever and if the music you listen to has ANY nuances then they will be completely lost. It sounds like listening to your music through tissue paper while the speakers are across the room.",1,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"Packaging is top notch.  Sound quality is clear but bass could be amped up some.  Battery life is as advertised, but keep in mind that I use only one bud for phone and do not use for music.  I do have one problem with these, and that after pairing with Galaxy S8 phone, the connection drops/connects approx., every few minutes.  This does not happen with any other BT devices used on this phone.  Have done recommended trouble shooting to no avail.  Currently waiting for response from TOZO customer service about problem.

"My husband bought these for me to wear on my morning runs.  It may be my ears, but none of the guards worked to keep these things in my ears. I wore them for the first time while doing some house cleaning, not quite as jostling as running, but active nonetheless.  I was adjusting them repeatedly, changing the guard sizes, trying again to no avail.  I was worried they’d fall out while i was cleaning the toilet.  It could be that the weight of the outer part is just too much to be offset by the part that inserts into the ear.  They work well if you’re not trying to do anything other than sit or walk.  There have been a couple little glitchy type things with the sound quality, but nothing repetitive and ultimately not a big deal. They work surprisingly well at noise cancelling.",3,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"I really enjoyed (and still do when they can hold a charge) this purchase. It took a while to get used to not having any wires and keeping track of the case and the ear buds, I will admit. Between July 2019 and January 2020, the right bud dies super quick while the left still has great battery life. Since you set up the right bud as the master, and left as secondary, it will shut down both when the right dies.But they have great sound, and the noise cancelling is helpful. They do not kill all outside noise, but it takes out a lot! I still can use them, just have to charge quite often now.",3,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"The little wireless earbuds have great sound quality for listening to music.  They go into the box for storage/charging and automatically pair when they are pulled out of the charging box.  The charging box has a battery of its own so the earbuds get charged even when not connected to a charging cord or wireless charger.  If using for phone calls, the mic isn't great - it picks up sound from everyone nearby.  We'll keep them to listen to music because that part is great!",5,1,2019-8-22,1,0,0

"I had written a previous review about how inefficient my last pair were. Tozo reached out to me to, sent me new ones, and they work perfectly. They now connect automatically to my device, sound amazing, and battery life is better. I had originally given them a one star review but after their excellent customer service, I am very satisfied with my new pair and changed my rating to 5 stars.",5,1,2019-10-10,1,2,0
"I got these for my birthday (which I had to buy to replace the vacuum my husband bought me...smh) and seriously these are fantastic!  I just plugged them in, they connect to each other with no effort on my end, and easily connect to my phone.  The fit is fantastic, and do not fall out, no matter how hard I try!!!  The sound quality...WOW!!!  I had no idea how bad the cheap cord ones I have used for years were until I used these.  I can't comment on the moisture wicking, but these are seriously the best!",5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"Awesome ear buds! I was looking for some good Bluetooth running earbuds and have finally found them! I had some other brands that i had to return bc they either fell out of my ear or the wires that connected them would catch on the back of my neck and drive me crazy. So o decided to order these... they have been awesome so far! Excellent sound, they stay in place and the battery life has been much better than anticipated! I have run everyday this week and they are still fully charged. I just put them back in the case after every run and the case charges them right up. The waterproofing is an excellent addition!",5,1,2019-2-13,1,0,0
"So in general these aren't a bad set of ear buds as you can see by the other reviews.However, the set that I got must be defective as they have a really poor connection during use. While using them in the gym if I moved more that 3 feet away from my phone the audio would cut out. 1 ear bud would stay connected and the other will go out, the would reconnect, then it would flip.",2,1,2019-10-30,1,0,0
"Product works well. Easily paired and so very convenient to use. I love the ability to use the right earbud while leaving the other in the case. Allows me to have a conversation while being able to listen to music. I've owned so many earbuds but this is the best for using while my head was in a pillow which helped me recuperate while being sick. Even with all of these features, the best was the customer support and follow up from the company. It's been a long time since I've had a company that I actually felt cared about my experience. Will buy many products from them in the future.",5,1,2019-9-6,1,1,0
"My father has been a music producer all his life. I have used high quality earphones in recording studios and I can say, the price I paid for these would make me buy it again even if I lost them.  The only thing i would say is, the loudest they can go isn't the greatest. When you turn them up on the earbuds themselves they don't really change in volume.  However, any problems and the Company will help you the very day you send them an email. This company... Treats their customers right. I had bought these earbuds for my first wireless pair ever. I had lost my left earbud about a month after and I emailed the company. They treated me kindly and actually offered to get me a replacement. FOR FREE. It was NOT in my warranty!! I will recommend this company for any of my friends who are looking for earbuds.",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"These headphones are a bit ridiculous. The charging case stays on even after the headphones are charged, until the battery is drained both from the case and the headphones. There is no way to turn it off. I’ve been leaving the headphones out of the case when I don’t use them, otherwise they are always dead. Also, the headphones gives me three warnings that the battery is dying. But the warning are within 5/10 seconds from each other. So in less than a minute from the first warning, you are left with dead headphones in your ears.",2,1,2020-8-8,1,1,0
"Just received these air buds a couple of weeks ago. Within the first two weeks, distance of Bluetooth connection is better than anything I have ever purchased (can go between multiple floors in home without connection issue). Buds fit comfortably in your ear and the extra sizing options you normally receive with higher cost products. Noise cancellation is pretty good, but as I’ve never owner ear buds that also have that capability, I can’t make a fair comparison. I rated the battery life of the earbuds at an average rating, only because I haven’t used them all the way to completion, as I only work-out around 45 minutes to an hour. Otherwise, no complaints. Customer service is fast and pretty amazing. With more use, I will change these ratings to higher ratings overall, as these buds are the best option in have in my arsenal. Customer service is also a game-changer for a $40 option!",4,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
These earbuds are fabulous.  The sound quality is excellent no matter what volume you choose to use these earbuds for.  I've had some wireless earbuds before but they did not cancel out any of the outside noise but these do!  I use these earbuds at work when I walk (usually outside) and I can get a good week of not charging out of the earbuds.  They do not need to be charged every night - which is fabulous as I do not need one more thing to remember at night to do.,5,1,2019-7-13,1,0,0
I needed noise cancelling earphones for work. I really wanted headphones but they're so expensive so I opted for these instead because they were on sale even with the already low price.I'm surprised at how noise cancelling these are and am very pleased with how long they last.,4,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"I am in love with these headphones! The sound is great the fit is wonderful! I didn't even have to swap out the ear pieces that come with it, but if needed they send a multiple sizes of ear pieces to get a perfect fit. These are guaranteed to fit. Waterproof! Wireless charging option! These are truly appreciated features! The cons other people are complaining about don't really affect me as I don't use these for calls. I strictly use these for my podcast / music and have had no issues. If you go watch the YouTube videos and the reviews there you will learn a lot about how to use these headphones properly. Walking about my house I do not lose connection with Bluetooth. Granted I have a smaller home but it's good to know that you can move room to room without carrying your phone with you. Anyway, so glad I got these as an alternative to the over priced air pods or other brands. Time will tell how long they last but so far they are an excellent pair of headphones, if you were on the fence don't hesitate just buy them! Can't be beat for the price!",5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,1
Either I got a bad pair or something else.  But I was listening to some music and buds began to have a nasty static noise.  Just got them today and used them for only an hour....Will be returning and not sure if I will be getting a replacement.,1,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"I loved the noise cancelation that these have. There is no software based NC, but they do seem to plug your ears very well. Audio quality is above and beyond a 50$ pair of earbuds, has wireless charging, case is built really well. I have walked about 50 feet from my phone and had no dropouts in sound. Just make sure you aren’t in a collision domain. Many different things can affect Bluetooth. WiFi, other Bluetooth devices, microwaves etc, but this is still the best bang for your buck. I would get these over AirPods.",5,1,2019-7-2,1,1,0
"I wish I had found these before wasting money on other styles and brands.  These things are awesome.  I don’t know where to start but I love these things.  I wanted a music solution for while I mowed the lawn and these are it.  I ride on a loud zero turn and finally I can hear my music loud enough to enjoy it.  The buds are lightweight and comfortable.  The sound is punchy and capable of handling deep bass.  The charging case is tight and compact and it too is IPX8. Even its charging port is protected by a snug, watertight flap.  I’m so excited about these little buds!  Don’t hesitate, just buy them and you’ll see for yourself.  Totally awesome!",5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"This is the second pair we have purchased in our household.  These are great for in the car as they cancel the road noises.  They fit snugly and are made well.  When making a phone call others have no trouble hearing what I am saying.  They fit well into the ear and never feel like they will fall out.  The earbuds never seem to lose a charge even if the case shows it needs a charge.If one wants to connect to a second device, a compromise can be made by using only one of the ear buds.  It will connect to your phone first then you can connect to an ipod or other device.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"I was hopeful that buying this product would be a positive purchase, especially with 10,000+ reviews and the majority of them being positive ratings. The product arrived quickly as anticipated. Out of the box, they seemed to be a quality item. I read the directions and synced to my phone and they played right away with no initial issue. Then I started experiencing intermittent problems with the left earbud, where the left one would cut in and out. This is not just a once of twice thing. It happened 40+ times in an hour or so. I tried in house, outside, in the gym, and yes, my phone (XR) was about three feet from these earbuds while this was happening. Remembering that the directions said that if you experience connection issues or static, you should shut them down and re-pair to your phone again. I did this and tried again. Same problem. I then tried it again the next day and the same issue occurred. The cutting in/out seemed to happen more often when the volume was turned up towards the max and even seemed to align with the bass in the music. Not sure if I got a bad one or if that is what was to be expected, pursuant to the instructions in the box which talk about static and connections issues. Disappointing.. Just dropped them off to be returned.",1,1,2019-9-13,1,0,0
"Bought these for my daughter who is a competitive dancer. She can use these back stage and while warming up to listen to her music without interference from what’s happening around her. She also uses these for her online dance classes. They stay in place even while working out. Even when not getting ready for the stage, she uses these for everyday movie watching as well as participating in her classroom discussions. Great product and highly recommend!",5,1,2020-7-5,1,1,0
"First thing to like is the ease of pairing. Really couldn't have been any easier! Next high point is the great sound. Deep, deep bass and clear highs make for a truly enjoyable listening experience. The noise cancelation feature really completes the listening experience bu minimizing the intrusion of undesirable external noise. Having a level 10 water resistence really is icing on the cake.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
These are a great alternative to the more expensive wireless buds I was looki g at. They fit great and work excellent. I knocked one star off because they do disconnect then reconnect more often then they should. I've tried resetting them but it does still happen. I'm impressed by the battery life but the remaining life notification in my Bluetooth settings do t seem terribly accurate. They stay above 50% for a long time then seem to drop to 20% quickly. Maybe I'm not paying close enough attention to remaining life but the overall life is good.,4,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
My personal tips for people who's struggling:1. Use various sizes of earbuds to find what's a good fit for you. Spend good amount of time to find it because it is important for your future use.,5,1,2019-7-10,1,0,1
"I was first impressed with the packaging of these earbuds. I know that doesn't add to the sound quality but it certainly gives a purchaser a great first impression. In addition, I had occasion to contact the company and their response was both very prompt and extremely satisfying. Wow! I didn't expect that.The sound quality of these earbuds is excellent. At my age my hearing is not the best but the sound output has made me forget that limitation. Great product and great value.",5,1,2019-5-27,1,0,0
"I question the reviews about not being loud enough for the gym! EEks  I had it at 1/3 the volume and it was plenty loud at peak times at the gym!  It has not fallen out of my ear, despite much sweating!  My friend and I can go for a walk together and listen to music together! I use one ear bud and he wears the other.... the different sizes of ear bud attachments make that possible!  It easily paired with my phone....I love it!",5,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
"I bought these to replace some expensive Jay birds I had.  I got tired of the wire connecting both ears.  These are great because they are separate, they have a tad too much bass, but it isn't terrible.  You can adjust your EQ and it'll be perfect, I just don't like the inconvenience of having to change it back for when my car connects.I've used these maybe 10 times, get very sweaty, and they're working fine.  The rechargeable battery dock is a nice touch.",5,1,2019-6-22,1,0,0
"The left earbud didn't work on my first set and I returned them.  The seller immediately sent me a new pair free of charge!  Unfortunately, the left earbud didn't work on that set either.  Luckily, they sent a 3rd pair which I think was a mistake since I didn't ask for a 3rd pair, but the earbuds work great so I'm keeping them! They definitely stay in your ear while you jump, run, exercise, mow the grass, etc., and they're completely noise canceling so you can hear nothing but the music from the earbuds.",4,1,2019-3-6,1,0,0
Love these! It charges in the case on my fast wireless charger pad. Comes with a usb charger but the pad is easier and faster. Sound is great! Synced with my iPhone in about two seconds and I did nothing but turn them on. I have had other pairs and these are by far the best. Volume can go high which I like for work and sound quality is perfect! Highly recommend.,5,1,2020-6-3,1,0,1
"It's really disappointing the issues with this headset. First off they sound amazing! BUT the Bluetooth connection issues are too much to overlook. Constantly disconnecting left earbud if I step 4 feet from my phone. Browsing internet or doing stuff on your phone will cause the left earbud to cut in and out. If your at a busy gym, your gonna get annoying Bluetooth interference with everyone else causing cuts in and out. If they fixed the Bluetooth issues this would be a 5 star but unfortunately it's caused me to return it and go with another product",2,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"Pretty disappointed. Although the sound quality is excellent, these constantly fall out of my ears. I have tried each of the provided silicone attachments and still haven’t found a good fit. Additionally, the battery life is horrible. It seems the battery is being used even while the headphones are off and in the case. I give them a full charge, then two days later when I go to use them, they’re dead. I barely use them now since they don’t hold a charge.",2,1,2020-6-29,1,1,0
"I bought these to have something to use while working that was wireless and wouldn’t get in the way. I used them for about two days before i decided that they were not for me because of how they fit in my ear. The sound quality wasn’t bad But I expected more for $50, kinda crackly when you turned them up to anything above half way to full volume. The noise cancellation was good, but that might have been because even with the smallest size of earbud that came with it, the fit was too tight and cause too much discomfort to keep using. I didn’t have them long enough to really get a feel for the battery life. But if you considering buying these, make sure they are what you want. Because I returned them over 2 weeks ago and I still haven’t gotten a refund. I can’t even track the refund through amazon anymore. So just be sure that you have no interest in getting your money back if you have any issues.",3,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"I’ll be very honest these ear buds are very good, the sound is excellent and I do feel the noise cancellation is okay.I purchased Bose air buds A little over a year ago and then I lost them. I thought about purchasing a cheaper pair but I didn’t want to cheaper quality, these are not cheap quality at all.",5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"All in all, a very nice product. The waterproofing lives up to standard, the case charges the earbuds very quickly and charges quickly itself, they feel nice in your ears and they don't fall out easily.My only problem with them is that the button functions only allow you to pause and play the music, there is no way to change the song with them. Double-clicking the button typically does this on other headsets with controllers, but I quickly found that that redials the last number you called for some strange reason. You also cannot change the function of the buttons, and they're all geared toward phonecalls and not music.",5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I have been using these for a few weeks now during my workouts. Everything seems to work fine, except the Bluetooth connection. My pair uses the right earbud as the master and the left one as the slave (meaning my phone connects to the right side and that connects to the left one). The connection to the right earbud is ok, not good, but ok. Works fine when my phone is near me but if I venture more than 10 or so feet away in the same room it starts to cutout (note that Bluetooth should work at 30ft+ in an open space). It will also cutout if my phone is in my right pocket and I look to the left. My bigger problem is the left one. That one cuts out constantly even when my phone is in my hands. It's very annoying and causes me a lot of frustration during my workout.Reached out to the manufacturer for a replacement, will update if the new pair is any better.",1,1,2019-8-30,1,0,0
"I’ve used this with both an apple and android device and the connection quality is terrible. Lots of cutting out, or odd splitting into separately playing audio on both earbuds. Battery life is inconsistent, and there is no indication of low battery until it’s just about to die (will go from 90% to 10% suddenly). Once it gets there it will repeatedly chirp at you that the battery is low about 2 minutes before the battery dies. It’s not like there’s an option to charge it while I’m using it, so I’m not sure what the point is of that. Between the constant audio shorting out and the game of chicken I play with the battery life every time I step out the door, I really can’t recommend them. At least the earbuds themselves block out sound pretty effectively.",2,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"Do not buy.I have given them 2 stars because they fit well. However, often times only one earbud will connect to my phone. As soon as I get the other to connect the first one disconnects. It’s very frustrating.",4,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"These headphones are perfect for my daily casual usage on the train. They stay in well due to the multiple sized earbuds, and the microphone is actually clear for people to understand if you're on the phone.

"Likes: What I love about these headphones is that they have great sound quality and they fit extremely well surprisingly. Whenever you do heavy lifts such as deadlifts they tend to come out, but it takes less than 5 seconds to put them back in.Dislikes: they stopped operating 3 months in! I was so shocked because it happened randomly one day whenever I tried syncing them to my phone. The earbuds stopped pairing with one another and it was hopeless trying to factory reset them. Thankfully customer service sent me a new pair for free!! I would pretty stoked about it, so I only went a week without headphones. Very pleased with the customer service!",5,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0
I purchased these ear buds for my versa2.  I do own apple air pods but could not control volume on my versa2.  I am very happy to report that I can control the volume with my versa2 and the sound is great !!!  I posted a earlier review saying I did not receive the different size of ear covers boy is my face red they were at the end of the enclosed box.  So sorry I posted that.  I would hightly recommend these ear buds!!!!,5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
"I have to say I really love these.  I was a bit hesitant at first because of the low cost, but I find myself wearing them a lot more than I thought I would.  It took me a couple of days to get used to it because I am not used to having something inside of my ear.  After I got used to them I can't take them out.  Comfortable, long battery, they pair perfect with my Pixel 3XL.  I can't say enough good things about them so far.",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
I got these as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend to use when he works out. Unfortunately they always fall out of his ears and cause frustration because it interferes with his workouts having to stop and put them back in constantly. He's tried all of the different sized ear pieces included and none stay in. I've even given him my ear hooks from my own ear pods that I don't have problems with and they still fall out. I'm looking into returning them now.,1,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
Got this for the wife as she didn't want an expensive big brand wireless earbud.So far it has been good. It was very easy to setup and pair. The instructions were clear even though the Grammar could use some help especially when the product is targeted at the US market.,4,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0

I was really excited to start using these headphones while I run. But was sad because the Bluetooth connection goes in and out when your phone is just in your hands. You really have to keep your phone close to the headphones to have a strong connection. I reached out to customer service and they said they would send me a new pair and they also help to reset them. But still didn’t work. Customer service was helpful but still disappointed,3,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
These headphones are absolutely amazing. I honestly didn’t think they were gonna be that good. I made sure to do my research before hand to make sure they had all the features that I looked in wireless earbuds. They seemed legit so I bought a pair. When they finally arrived I was satisfied with the packing nothing was broken and the box was in perfect condition. Everything was well put in the box and very neat. The best thing I love about these earbuds is the ibx8 waterproof. This works exactly how it says it does. I’ve taken a shower with them about 4 times now and the first time I even dropped it in the shower and I put them right back in and they were perfectly fine. The bass on these are INSANE!!! That’s one thing I was a little iffy about but I gotta give them props cause they are amazing. Other than that it’s just an all around great buy and it’s basically the Samsung wireless earbuds just a cheaper version that does the same exact things if not better.,5,1,2019-11-6,1,0,1
"I have just charged it and connected, so easy and intuitive, didn’t even need the manual.

"Everything they claim on their Amazon page is accurate and true.  I tried several other pairs of bluetooth earbuds.  These were the last pair I was going to try before making the jump to Samsung earbuds that cost $130, but I actually like these more.

"I spent quite a bit of time researching various earbuds after my wife bought some earPods and wouldn't stop gloating about them. I accepted the challenge to find <$200 earbuds that were of comparable quality.While I will say that these are not as versatile as the earPods (earPods don't feel as stuffy as these ones do, and have better noise pass-through when off), I sure love the fact that these cost about 25% of the price as hers.

I have a hard time finding earbuds or any headphone for that matter that actually stay in. Since I bought these they have not once fallen out. If you are like me then these are the earbuds for you!  The different size gel caps are great if you have an odd smaller or bigger ears. The sound quality thus far is awesome.

You pair with the Right side since that is the main one, and when you take it out of the charging box, it'll pair up automatically with each other.Battery life is really good and the charging case is super convenient. The case is also qi-wireless charging compatible which is super useful and you don't have to deal with wires. It also has neat magnetic lid and place for the ear buds that snap the buds into place with ease.

"Overall I like this product like the others have said, I can’t wear apple iPods and these are very comfortable they don’t fall out and there snugged in just right . Apple iPods are so expensive and I wanted affordable ones and these do the trick ! I highly recommend ! I got the blue ones something different rather then white or black .",5,1,2020-9-28,1,0,1
"These earbuds are really great. I was concerned that they  would not fit snug enough in my ears to keep from falling out during a work out and they have been great so far. My only issue with these is that the noise will cut out from time to time even with my phone in my pocket. The bluetooth range is also pretty limited with these. You don't have to move to far from your device before the sound starts cutting out.For the money, I think these are worth it. The sound is really good and the set up is easy. The bass is really deep with these, almost too much depending on what you are listening to. The cut out issues are really more of an annoyance than anything else.",4,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"You get what you pay for. They’re fine if you’re going to the gym or for a quick run, but the battery dies after 2-3 hours. You also absolutely cannot make phone calls with it because you won’t be heard. The charging box is a little too big. I would’ve preferred something slimmer. I will say they’re quite comfortable, the sound is very good quality, and it does a decent job at canceling most noise out (I’m not easily distracted, so I like hearing some background noise).",1,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"I had the Samsung ones but my dog ate them.

When trying to use the left ear piece only sound keeps cutting off and and it’s just unusable as well. When using both the sound is good, but almost every time there’s  head movement the sound cuts off. It gets really annoying.. like I said built is good and Sound is good.

"This review is simple: if what you want is great detailed sound (high highs, balanced mids, and strong bass), security, durability, and AFFORDABILITY, then look no further. Case provides 4 full charges for 3hrs of long lasting sound, and the earbuds fit securely (after selecting the right cup size for your ear) to provide you with the peace of mind while you go running, jumping, rowing, and all other general activity, and no fear of losing a bud. The saying is ""you get what you pay for"" and for a measly $40 compared to $140 apple ear pods (which for me fall out at the twitch of an ear), you get a whole lot more for your buck.",5,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"Quality is pretty nice an simple to hook up just choose TOZO-T10-R when you see it on the bluetooth an you are set.Haven't really run long with it, but it takes a light jog, make sure to use the tight earpieces that fits your ear so it wouldn't move around. Overall its small and fun to use.",5,1,2020-3-3,1,1,0
"I've used these for a week on commuting and the gym (~11+ hours total), and I'm pretty happy. I'm not used to wireless earbuds and probably have gotten used to the shape of Apple style wired headphones, so they didn't feel super natural to me at first. I had to switch the size of the gel covering like recommended, but I've really gotten used to wearing them for hours on end. While I can't comment yet on its longevity of performance, I researched Airpods only last like 2-3 years so if these can do the same, they are a way better deal. I noticed how many good reviews these got and I think so far that has spoken to their functionality and quality. Really strong noise-cancellation, which I wasn't expecting. Almost makes it hard to interact with the outside world until you press ""pause"", which you then can kind of hear people muffled, but I'm going to assume that's a common thing with the earpods. Overall, I'm satisfied.",4,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"Worth the buy, sound quality is crisp and clean. Pairing is simple, you can wear it showering, swimming but not underwater. Keep in mind that the Signal transmission is 10m any greater than that you will experience some interruptions. You can customize earbuds by selecting ear caps that fit you.I enjoyed these wireless earbuds. Definitely worth a buy.",5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
"Overall this was a good purchase.  I found out the hard way that when you use these buds, don't let them touch each other or place them in a pouch or carrier that will cause them to touch.  Keep them in the bulky cradle provided so that they are separated.  The bulky (my only negative) cradle is a pain to carry in your hiking shorts (as I do), but the cradle provides additional battery power should you be on a long hike/run as well as keeping the buds apart.  When touching they tend to disable each other.  I found the customer service department of this company to be very generous & helpful when I encountered a few problems due to my ignorance as stated above.",5,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
Just wanted  to share a quick review- The TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds ear pods sound absolutely great and  they were incredibly affordable.  I have smaller ears but found these to fit snug yet comfortable. I 'm so glad I found them and after  reading many of the other reviews I gave the a shot! Completely satisfied with this purchase - I think you will be too---> using the money I saved to buy a cd burner for my macbook  ;),5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"The earbuds are surprising easy to setup and sync with my phone. They came charged and ready go. They come with different size tips. I found out when fitting these in my ear that I have two different ear canal sizes. This was no problem, I just used two different earbud tips. The sound quality was better than expected. I got these for my bike rides since my Apple Airpods aren't nearly loud enough for me to hear once the wind starts blowing around my ears. They stay in my ears have had not yet fallen out, even on my bike rides.",5,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"I primarily use these earbuds to workout. I also use them for general use around the house, because I style my hair and using over-the-head headphones would ruin my hairstyle.My previous headphones was the Amorno Wireless Headphones. The TOZO T10 is my second set of earbuds. I needed a new set of earbuds because the Amorno Headphones charging case usb connection thing broke (not my fault).",5,1,2019-7-30,1,0,0
"Battery life is not great.  The lowest volume on these is still too loud. There is no way to quietly listen when you might want to do that.  Also the sound, I’m not sure how to describe? Maybe a lack of bass. The sound is almost annoying. The one positive; they don’t fall out of my ear. I guess they were about what I would expect for less than $30.",3,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
Pros: These work well and have better sound quality than the corded earbuds I was using. The case charges with a regular microusb cable and the buds make a satisfying click when they snap into it.The batteries last several hours for sure but definitely will need charging on e.g. a longer trip.,3,1,2019-8-12,1,0,0
"The weak Bluetooth signal makes this almost unusable. My phone or laptop could be three feet away, but it will cut out when my body turns the wrong way, or if I happen to rest my hand on my head and partially obstruct the line of sight.I took them on a walk the other day, and I literally had to keep the phone in my right front pocket so that my body didn't keep obstructing the signal to the main receiver in the right ear bud. (And I'm a fit person, just to preempt your fat jokes.)",2,1,2020-5-9,1,0,1
"I work in a factory and the noise cancelation works great. The Mic work great, the battery will last forever if you swap ear's throughout the day like me, and it sounds great.remember to dry off connections between the ear buds and the charger if they get wet (not damp, wet.) or you will need to buy another set like I'm about to do. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<The connections will corrode and fail >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Just something about this type of tech that a didn't think about that cost me.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"They fit well in the ear and are very compact which is great.  Also for the price point I didn’t expect many bells and whistles which is fine.  The sound quality is solid for being under $50. No complaints there.The battery life leaves a lot to be desired as I only get a few hours out of them at most before they die.  When the audible battery life notification starts, you have less than a minute till they’re completely dead.",3,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"I bought these after my last headphones stopped working. Paying $240 for wireless earbuds did not sit well with me so I looked at these and after all the raving reviews, I thought I’d give them a try. I can see why there are so many positive reviews on this product! They are so comfortable (I use the ear attachments that are already on the earbuds), sound great, and cancel out a lot of the noise.  No matter how much I move my head, they do not budge. The charging case is just an added bonus to the earbuds. It’s so easy to carry around. I am very pleased with this product overall!",5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"Very good performance. Sound quality and noise cancellation is as good as expected. Mic sensitivity is a bit weak.However, it has a bit conflict with my laptop. Whenever it is connected with my laptop, there is always a high-pitch white noise in left earbud. When connected with other devices, e.g. my iphone, no high-pitch white noise. I suspect it is due to signal frequency conflict with my laptop Bluetooth signal.",5,1,2019-7-22,1,1,0
"I bought these to use for running and for calls at work.  They worked well initially, although I had to spend a lot of time switching around different earbud tips to get them to fit.  They would not stay in while running, at all.  After a few months, they starting behaving very erratically: they would pair with my laptop, then immediate drop when an application tried to use them (even adjusting volume).  After about 5 minutes of use with another device, and the left earbud just drops.  Don't buy.",1,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"Absolutely terrible quality. Within seconds I was ripping these out and digging my old waterlogged Apple earbuds out of the trash. No noise cancelation, static in the background, and just all around terrible quality. I could find the same quality in the headphones you get for free on an airplane. $50 for Bluetooth noisemakers? Yeah right. They look good, but they ain't good.",1,1,2019-6-13,1,3,0
When I first got these headphones they were pretty legit and actually I was honestly pretty impressed by them. They had great noise-cancellation their battery life was good and the sound quality was good. It is August 2nd and I got these July 27thfor some reason just out of nowhere I felt like the sound quality dropped the noise cancellation is still good and the battery time is still good. but I just decided to put them in one time and when I went to go turn on my music the song quality wasn't there like it used to be I have to turn my volume to max in order to have a normal hearing of it. Or when it used to be I could barely keep it on six clicks without it starting to get super loud. I honestly still love these headphones but I don't know why the sound quality got lowered hopefully this is maybe just a fluke with mine.,2,1,2020-8-2,1,0,1
"I also am one of  those people who cannot wear just any earbuds.  Finally I have found a pair that fits.  When I workout I sweat, and these earbuds stayed in my ear.  The sound is great also.  When answering the phone with them the quality is great also.  I do wish that you could forward to the next song, but I can forgive that because they are able to stay in my ear.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has a hard time keeping earbuds in their ears when they are working out.  Also I love the fact that the charging case is waterproof also, and the case comes with a strap.",5,1,2019-6-30,1,0,1
"I needed a way to listen to music at work without having cords hanging as I only use one at a time. Based on customer reviews I decided to give them a try-so glad I did!! They arrived in one day, all charged up, pairing was a snap.  The only reason I have 4 stars for noise canceling is because I don’t use them both at once, however the sound quality is awesome I’m very pleased. The range is excellent! I got an entire work day (9 hrs) of play from one charge, I use the right one first then charge it while the left one is in use. The fit is great, I had no worries about them falling out.All in all, I would recommend these! And a 1 year warranty is included..",5,1,2019-5-14,1,0,0
"I was highly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, right out of the box these earbuds looked impressive, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing. The bluetooth have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 40 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. The charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds.",5,1,2019-8-1,1,0,0
"This product works pretty well, for about a month and that's it. Pairing is dependent upon the right earbud and that is the one that became faulty therefore making the device unusable. Prior to becoming unusable, the earbuds gave so-so quality, what you would expect for earbuds at a slightly cheaper pricepoint. Spend a little more money and get a more reliable product. LOOK ELSEWHERE!",1,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
I am changing my rating based on the proactive customer service for this item.  I believe I had received a defective initial pair of earbuds and the customer service reached out to me to send an upgraded set for free.  I appreciate their time and effort to make this a positive transaction.  New set seems to be working well.  Good sound and hopefully battery life meets spec.,5,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0
"I had high hopes for these based on reviews alone. I’ve never owned a pair prior so I had nothing to compare to.Upon arrival, they connected to my phone immediately. Great!!!! Put them in my ears, not even close to staying put. I changed the plastic coverings, nothing helped. They are huge!! They last about two hours in play time, seem to charge pretty fast. Sending them back as I could not get them to stay in my ears.",2,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
First they're pretty much the same quality as my last bluetooth headphones. Same or less battery life. Except they mess up a ton when outside just walking. A solid 4/5 in my current experience.Update: The right ear piece seems to die lot quicker than the left. The battery life barely gets me 3 hours or less before I have to charge them.,3,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"The case is super smooth, and feels a lot sturdier than charging cases ive had in the past. It seems durable. I LOVEEE that it has a loop to secure a keychain or lanyard to them so they wont get easily lost (although i am not a fan of the lanyard it came with). The ear buds are solid, the sound is great and they can get pretty loud. The noise cancellation is a great plus, I usually put on headphones when I'm doing a task i need to focus on. And who doesn't love a wireless charging case! So convenient.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,1
"Just got these for my daughter (12y/o) she had no problem connecting them herself. So I would say ease of use is amazing.  Everything was neatly packed and easily accessed. If she doesn’t break these in less than 6 months they are worth every penny I got them for. She says the sound is clear and loud enough to block out her brother.  So I’d say noise cancellation is good, because my son is really loud and annoying at this time in his life. All in all a decent product.",5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"They are nice looking and convenient, but they aren't as loud as I hoped and as some have said in other reviews - I don't think the sounds quality is that great either.I don't like how you can't increase the volume on the buds,  and can't skip tracks from them either. If I would have known any of these things about these buds, I would have never chose them. I don't feel like they are worth what I paid.",3,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
"I got these after ordering some dud earphones from another seller and seeing these recommended in those reviews. I am very happy with my purchase. The difference in quality is astounding! These feel well made, the battery is quality and the earphones have a magnet to affix them to the charger easily. The range is good and so is the sound quality. I am very happy with my purchase.",5,1,2019-3-21,1,1,0
"Pretty good quality overall. Love the battery life and how small they are in my ear - minimal wind interference!Only real complaint is with the touch commands - sometimes my arm will graze the side while stretching or lifting over my head and it will pause. Also trying to power off by touching and holding both sensors is very inconsistent - it usually just picks up a ""forward"" or ""reverse"" command instead. But not the end of the world, I usually just pause and put them in the case to power off.",4,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"Great headphones for a fantastic price.  Use them during my workouts and handle both sweat and pool just fine.  Fits well in my ear with no risk of falling out during workout.I did have on problem and reached out for support, which was handled quickly and professionally.  Nice when a company stands behind the products.  Great alternative to the much higher priced options from Apple, Google, and Samsung.  Had samsung earbuds before this that had a problem, and samsung did not stand behind their product like tozo did.  Kudos.",5,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"Normally I use electronic devices longer before reviewing them. However, this set has so far proven better than the 4-5 other bluetooth headphones I've owned, so I'm happy to review them now!-Great range, better than any other BT earbud set I've owned (all at this price point)",5,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"Love these wireless earbuds.  They are so easy to use right out of the package.  The sound is very clear.  If you are one who has trouble finding earbuds that are comfortable, they have four different sizes of ear caps.  You will easily find a size to fit your ears.And can you believe they are actually waterproof!!  I have already talked my mom into getting a pair for herself.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"Don’t have much to complain about at all! The only thing I don’t love is the battery life, wish it lasted longer. I accidentally washed one of the ear buds and it works perfect still! I know they say it’s waterproof but I was a little nervous about it being washed but it did great, don’t plan to do that again though :/ ha. But the sound is great and people are able to hear me no problem as well!",4,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"I’m not one to write reviews (good or bad) unless I absolutely feel that it is necessary for others to know my experience. I’m very sad and disappointed about these headphones because I had super high hopes about them after reading a lot of good reviews. I’ve never had a problem with a pair of headphones fitting perfectly and staying in my ear but these...they didn’t stay at all. I tried all the different sizes multiple times, read the directions, stood in front of a mirror and played around with them for awhile and I could never get them to stay in place. As far as anything else about them, I can’t comment on that because I never got past them being able to fit in my ear for more than a few seconds so I couldn’t test the sound, charging box, battery life, etc. Also, I must add (and this is just my own personal opinion) but it felt like a suction cup on my eardrum when I was trying to get them in correctly and I don’t like that feeling at all.",1,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
So I’ve always been hesitant to wear the ear buds cause I have little ears... I’m happy they provided 3 different sizes to fit I’m the smallest. For how little these are they really are awesome !! This is my favorite purchase of this year. I really like having the case to place them back in so I just keep them In my purse now. The sound quality is amazing and even when I take calls there’s no problems there either.,5,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
"You won’t believe what just happened. I just unloaded my washer and found these at the bottom of the soaking wet clothes. So, I hopped on to write a review for you all. My husband already loved his Father’s Day gift....now we are super impressed. (I’m sure the maker won’t suggest you try this at home)",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"They worked great for about a month and then they stopped connecting to each other.  This means that you can use only one earbud at a time.  The manufacturer reset, which is supposed to remedy the problem, does not work.It is interesting to note that they provide a “solution” (which does not work) in their manual.  If this is a known issue why have they not addressed it?",1,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"No matter which adapter I used, I couldn’t get these to fit in my ear properly. I have had trouble with buds before but thought I would give these a try. I cannot rate any of the other features, but if you have problems with ear buds in general, don’t think these will solve that problem. I am returning these and plan on getting a set with ear hooks.",1,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
If you are looking for a little bass...these are not the headphones for you. They are loud and have a lot of treble...good for Metal. Bad thing about these is you cannot skip songs. A double click will redial your last number called. I'm not sure if I will keep these...only because sometimes...you just got to skip the next song in the middle of a workout.,3,1,2019-4-2,1,1,0
"These headphones are a complete disgrace to all headphones out there. Where do I start? Oh, the bluetooth functionality....if you wanna call it that. It works when it wants to, for the most part doesn't work at all. I'm so upset with these headphones I don't even feel like writing a review about how crappy they are. They are so crap they aren't even worth the negative review I'm giving here.",1,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"Was skeptical that these would not be any good for 30-35$. I am amazing by the sound quality, and they do a great job of noise cancellation. So keep in mind you wont hear much of what is going on in the outside world if you have both of these on. I usually keep the right one in when I am doing certain tasks so i can still hear whats going on around me. The pause/play button is a little hard to press, but i think that's a good thing to prevent accidental pausing. Microphone is actually REALLY good on these too. Overall 10/10 for the price. Battery life is astounding too. Case is kinda bulky but that is probably due to the large battery life so I can for sure compromise.",5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
So I just got my new Pixel 4 phone and I wanted some cool really good earbuds to go with them. I checked out the reviews online and found these to be really good. I was not disappointed pairing was so easy I couldn't believe it. Sound quality is awesome The only thing is that noise canceling is so good I can't hear anybody else talking which honestly is a good thing sometimes. I can't believe for this price that they are so good. Very happy with my purchase.,5,1,2019-10-31,1,0,0
"These are very uncomfortable.  They constantly fall out of my ears unless I shove them so far into my ear that it almost hurts.  They fall out so often that I’m pretty surprised I haven’t lost one or both yet.  Further, the battery life isn’t very good.  Not a good substitute for Air Pod style pods, which are FAR more comfortable.",2,1,2020-10-3,1,0,0
"So far, the earbuds are great. They sound phenomenal, fit well, and stay where you put them once you find the rubber tip that fits your ear correctly. HOWEVER, as some have experienced, I am finding that the left earbud cuts in and out frequently. When it does this, my phone is less than 18” from my head. The other aggravating thing is that it is random, and about the time I go to turn the buds off and back on, it quits. I just spent 30mins on a stationary bike with my phone on the shelf between cup holders, and it seems to be the worst there. Hopefully I can find a suitable solution, because I love these earbuds otherwise.",3,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
I really like the noise cancelation that these earbuds have. I also like that they have a wide range of volume. I can only handle about 4 clicks from muted. I enjoy them a lot and I hope to keep them for a long time.The main purpose why I got them is to use them while I run and they are great for outdoor running. They stay in place and they do not come off easily. They are sweat proof and when I use them I forget that I'm wearing them.,5,1,2019-11-9,1,0,1
"Got my wife a pair of these for her birthday, and i listened to them once and had to get myself a set. Great sound quality, i hear little bits of my music i've never heard before. They even block out background noise pretty well, too. The battery in the little charging case seems to drain kind of quickly, but the ear buds themselves hold a charge for a long time. Despite the case's short battery life, it will charge from stone dead to full in 20 minutes or so. Glad i bought these!",5,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0
"I had been looking for a pair of truly wireless earbuds that didn't cost me an arm and a leg. Especially now working from home and trying to carry an infant and/or my toddler, needed something where they couldn't pull the wire which in turn pulled out my earbud. I love that I can use one or both of these earbuds which helps when trying to have a work call and listening to what my 3 year old is saying to me as well. When I'm focused and using both earbuds, the sound quality and noise cancellation is fantastic! The sound quality while taking phone calls is amazing and they are very comfortable to wear once you find the right ear bud size. I really like that it comes with a charging case and that they automatically connect once you remove them from the case. Would highly recommend these for hand free use!",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"I bought this because I lost my earbuds. I could connect both earbuds wit no problem. Later on I noticed that the right earbud’s sound is not great as is the left one.  Left one I can tell bass, noise cancellation is superb but right one has a cheap sound.  Battery of right earbud (I can use only one at work) lasted less than 5 continuous hrs.",4,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"The sound, battery life and noise cancellation were all phenomenal. The quality of the product, less so. Within a day of using it began to cut in and out of it's reception with my phone, despite the phone being in my pocket; and then the auto shutoff upon placement in charging case failed and drained my headphones overnight so when I got to work they were both dead. If you're looking for a great sounding, shoddy product then look no further.",1,1,2020-7-17,1,1,0
This is an out-of-the-box review.  I can't comment on the longevity of the product because I've only had it for one day.Having said that I think it's Superior quality and very easy to use including well written instructions.  For the price you can't beat the quality of the product and the features and functionality.,5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"I just received these and tried them out and wow do they sound amazing. The only downside is I totally didn’t realize they don’t have a skip song or volume feature. Overall that’s not a break it for me so that’s why I gave 5 stars. I plan to use these for running, so if they’re terrible I’ll come back and edit my review but overall fit pretty decently, very customizable and really comfy. Definitely excited to have a completely wireless pair for work and working out! Also the case is magnetic which is really nice!",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,1
"Before using TOZO T10 Bluetooth earbuds I was listening to devices through their speakers, or through wire connected earphones.  The wire connected earphones just caused me irritation because they continually fell out.  I ordered the TOZO T10 Bluetooth earbuds at the suggestion of a friend, and they allow me to hike and listen to soft music without distraction.  The TOZO T10’s have greatly reduced the effects of anxiety in my life by allowing me an environment filled only with quiet piano music or other quiet instrumental music.  I enjoy all types of music; however, the quietness allowed by the TOZO T10 with soft music was something I saw as noteworthy. The Bluetooth earbuds have also been a big plus as far as phone conversations.  I have spent many hours outside walking while talking to a friend on the phone through the TOZO T10's and they are great.",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,1
It stays in your ear. Easy to recharge. As soon as you pop them out of the charger it reconnects to your phone. I really like that feature. The biggest problem is it picks up every noise in my truck and people can’t hear me that well. I mostly bought this for talking in my truck but I use it to listen to talk radio. The sound is very clear.Built well. Solid materials. Magnetic earbuds so they snap into place in the charger. Batteries last 3 hours when I continuously talk or listen to podcast.,4,1,2019-4-1,1,1,0
"I bought various Bluetooth earbuds which were less than $60. Tozo T10 had the best sound, and very loud. It's even slightly better than Airpod in my opinion. The caveat is that the shape of the earbuds is large and may not fit all types of ears. My phone is iPhone 8.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,1,0
"I really like the sound of the buds, nice bass!  They work great when just listening to music.  But when I try to use them with my IPhone 11, they keep disconnecting.  I am only using the right bud when using it for the phone, so I am not sure if that is why.  But, I can be talking, then I get... ""disconnected, reconnecting, connected"".  And this happens every 30 seconds to a minute.  Just got the new Iphone, so now the return period has passed, I guess I'm SOL!UPDATE:  changing my rating because the company offered me a refund after two sets of buds.  Good customer service.  I hear they have a newer model, but I have gone a different route, but am thankful for the refund.",4,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0

Really impressed by the sound quality and the connectivity via bluetooth 5.During first pairing better to reset (Thats what worked for me) and later successive pairing is quite easy. Perfectly fits my ear. if does not fit, you still got 3 more different sized pairs. Overall its great product for the price value.",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"The bass is incredible as are the mids. Drum sound is better than any earbuds I've listened to at this price point. Sound is clear and realistic. The highs get a little muddled but I found a solution for that. I replaced the tips with a pair of Comply SmartCore tips. They make a huge difference in the sound most noticeable in the highs, which now sound as good as the rest. The buds pair very well and fit nicely. Would have given these a 5 rating but without the 3rd party tips I'm rating them a 4.",4,1,2019-3-19,1,0,0
"I previously had wireless bluetooth headphones that were connected to each other via a cable and this upgrade to the 2 individual earbuds was something I didn't know how much I'd appreciate. I was especially impressed when I put them on and heard the sound. Every song I listen to sounds new with the great bass and full sound. In addition, the microphone is actually useable, which is something that hasn't been the case with my previous Bluetooth headphones.The negatives for this is that the connection between the two earbuds gets out of sync often, which results in either an echo or audio drop outs almost every time I'm walking around with them. In addition, when you take the headphones out of the case to start using them, it takes about 20-30 seconds of booting up, syncing with each other then finally my phone. With my previous pair of headphones I'd turn them on and could be listening within 3-5 seconds.",3,1,2019-9-15,1,0,0
"Followed the instructions like 8 times and was able to reset the earbuds as recommended.  The left earbud just never sync'd or ""blinked slow blue"" as the instructions indicated.  The left earbud never played any sound over bluetooth.Returned the defective product.",5,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
"I’ve given these a couple of months and I have to say, they completely surpassed my expectations. First, they are COMFORTABLE! I was hesitant about the size but they ended up fitting just right. For the sound, There was enough cancellation to quiet the loud overhead music at the gym about 85% and I couldn’t hear the sound of my treadmill while watching Netflix, so that’s a huge win in my book. The sound is crisp and clean, music sounds full and the bass is great! Worked perfectly with my Apple products, too. Now for the style. It’s so nice that these fit INSIDE your ear so, unlike my AirPods, there’s nothing hanging down. It’s especially nice when removing a layer of clothing during a workout because nothing gets caught on the ear but and pulls it out. The case is sturdy and well designed. The case charges and so do the ear buds, which is great because it’s the equivalent of keeping a portable charger with you. I got about two and a half hours on a charge, popped them back in the case and charged them up from it. So useful! These are an excellent value. I find myself using them as my go-to over my high-dollar ones now!",5,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0

"These are awesome in every way EXCEPT one, and it's the most important one. The bluetooth connection is horrible. I loved these, I prayed to the high heavens that they would work because they fit wonderfully, they have great sound quality, the wireless charging aspect is awesome, the charging case is the best part of all of this. The biggest down side is that they CONSTANTLY cut out and lose the connection to my phone. They claim they have a 10m connection, but if my phone is in my back pocket of my jeans, I can barely listen to my music because they're cutting out every 30 seconds to a minute. It's frustrating and unfortunately outweighs all the positive things. Not sure how this got such positive reviews, since although nice quality in all other aspects, it's nearly impossible to actually listen to anything. Very, very disappointed.",1,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
I bought these in September 2019 and they have worked great until recently. The right earbud stopped turning on and would not charge. I emailed customer service and were quick to respond and are sending out a new set. Hopefully I won’t have any issues with the new set but time will tell.,4,1,2020-6-10,1,1,0
"After I lost one of my AirPods and couldn't justify the cost of new ones, I decided to get these based on the positive reviews. These do their job.... but not without some major issues. The main problem is the size and shape of the earphones. They are too big to comfortably fit in my ears, and so they constantly fall out and/or cause pain. I typically use headphones when traveling or when listening to a sleep podcast at night, and in either situation it's inconvenient to constantly readjust the earbuds as they pop out or put pressure on my ears. Even pressing down on them to turn them on will usually make them fall out. Based on that factor alone, I don't get a lot of use out of these. The battery life is also not the best. I wish that like the AirPods, they would conserve the battery by turning ""off"" when they're not in my ears or in the case.For the cost I wasn't expecting a lot, and they do their job. Had I known they would be impractical to wear on the run, I would have rather spent more money on headphones I could get more use out of, though.",2,1,2019-7-30,1,0,0
"I really enjoy these ear buds. I use them mostly when I'm cycling and have no issues with them falling out or answering my calls. I enjoyed them so much, I bought another pair for a friend, but they were defective. The left ear piece didn't work at all. In the midst of me exchanging them, we stopped talking. Wasn't meant to be I guess. I love mines. They work great. Sound quality is amazing... especially for the price. I highly recommend them even though the second pair didn't work.",5,1,2020-3-6,1,1,0
"I've only had these headphones for a short while but am very impressed. I was skeptical about true wireless headphones since I have never owned a pair and the reviews on several of other brands' were bad. I was worried about connection issues, poor sound quality, not connecting to my phone, range, etc. However, with these, I have had no issues at all. The sound quality is AMAZING. They have a really good bass and clarity for such small headphones and being in-ear. I also have had no connection issues and they have really good range. So as I understand it, the right connects to the device and the left connects to the right so that they will always play the same if the right has connection to the device, which is really smart in my opinion. I was also skeptical of them falling out or being uncomfortable but I have worn them several times to run/workout and they stay in place and are really comfortable. I would definitely recommend these for anyone who wants a nice pair of true wireless headphones for much less that name brand competitors!",5,1,2019-2-15,1,0,0
"These have been pretty good.  The controls are touch and the sound in fine for movies.  Music requires using an EQ,  and the range is not as good as wired or larger headphones, but acceptable.  I had purchase another pair, but the controls were push button,  looked exactly the same as the touch.  This pair is more comfortable to use.",4,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"I lose my headphones a lot, and shop around a bit when I repurchase, because you never know what badass thing is around the corner for less money (or occasionally more).  With that said, these kick the sh!t out of any other headphones I've bought under $50, and I'm hoping to find the pair I recently mislaid because the Tagry earbuds I bought to replace them don't hold a candle to the Tozos.  Stop looking in the $20-$30 range and just drop the $40.  you'll be glad you did.",5,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0

"Like some of the other reviews, I also had Apple AirPods (that my dog decided would make a nice chew toy). So instead of buying the super expensive ones I thought I'd try for something cheaper this time around. I have certain times at work where I'm making 20-40 calls a day and having hands free/good sound quality is a must. So I called my mom in a test call earlier and she said it sounded super crisp and clear. So WIN WIN! & I got to save about $100 by not buying Apple again. These headphones also DON'T FALL OUT of my ears!! Which honestly is the first pair I've EVER had that this is true for. Love these!",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"Sound is good for music, podcasts and calls. Sound is equivalent to mid-priced wired earbuds. Noise cancellation could be better when outdoors, but definitely not the worst. Single charge lasts about 2 hours. The case will charge the earbuds three times and works with a Qi charger.  I'm pleased with this purchase and the earbuds are better than I expected.",4,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"I bought these because I am on conference calls all day for work and my last pair died. I decided to try these bc they were on Deal of the Day. I can hear everyone I’m speaking with on the phone loud and clear. They can also hear me loud and clear but what they hear over me speaking is alll of the noise around me. Things that’s I can barely hear while outside (birds, kids playing, etc) are amplified to the person that I am speaking with so much so that I have to disconnect the headphones. Apparently a ceiling fan sounds like hurricane-force winds. They seem to be pretty decent quality and are very comfortable but I will not be able to use them because of the background noise they pick up.",2,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0
"I like the sound quality, the ability to talk with it is not the best, but maybe the signal from the phone call it self.The reason I say that is because the fact I dont always get great phone service. It has style and is comfortable, if your in to ear buds, some people like just regular headphones. the Bluetooth signal is pretty great.",5,1,2020-6-17,1,1,0
I am a walker and couldn't go as far without my music. I go rain or shine (usually.) I was looking for waterproof earbuds because I hate wearing a hat and sometimes I get wet. Not only are these waterproof but the sound is really great!

calls sound great with my iphone 11. Music sounds great and I can still hear what is going on in my surroundings which is important to me. Great buy for the money! no need to spend 1 and 2 hundred bucks. Update:A few days after completing the 1 year warranty on line I had a mishap and an earbud was exposed to water. I thought it had worked itself out but I was wrong. I contacted the company to see if they could help. Heddy got my information and circumstances and sent me a new pair! I had only asked for the one to be replaced but they sent a full new order. Incredibly kind and fast and all through email. Would highly recommend this product not only for the quality of sound and fit of the ear buds but because of the people backing the company too.,5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"I had these headphones for 90 days and loved them.  The sound quality is great and so is the noise cancellation (which I didn't realize I would enjoy as much as I did).I did take them swimming for the first time and one of the earbuds quit working.  I was outside of the return window, but they agreed to send a replacement ear bud.  The replacement bud worked, but the charging case would no longer shut off when the ear buds were fully charged, it would be completely dead if sitting for 6-8 hours.  I emailed Tozo asking for a new charging case.  1 week later a completely new set of earbuds showed up and again are working beautifully.",5,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0

You can only end it from your phone or wait for whoever you called to answer, then hang up on them ;) and to add to it, no volume control from the earbuds either. Bought these for listening to podcasts while floating in the pool, so given the above, I had to return these.Pros: from the very short time I had them, they were comfortable, the charging box felt very sturdy, easy to pair to my phone and good sound quality.",3,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0

"Overall, this is a really good product. Once I figured out which size rubber adapter fit my ears, these have been awesome. You would have to be ok with things being in your ears like earplugs for these to be comfortable. Sound quality is really good with good bass and quality treble and mids. The only thing I would like is for the battery life to be a little better, but considering how small these are and how good the sound quality is even at high volumes, it is more than acceptable for me.I mostly use them while running and they stay put in my ears and cause no discomfort. I would recommend these for the price.",5,1,2019-10-20,1,1,0

"Bought both the nude and gray version of the earbuds because I read great reviews about it. The other day I used it while doing some outdoor work and exercise. The earbuds stayed in my ear regardless of how much my head was moving around, which was great. I liked how the earbuds blocked out all of the unwanted noise and had a great sound quality to it. Also, the earbuds work fine if you just want to use it with just one ear in, instead of using both.The only down side was that I didnt get the smaller earcaps for the gray earphones. However, that issue was easily resolved by emailing the company and they were nice enough to send a new set of earcaps.",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,1
"I wanted to give the product 5 stars because there is so many positive things. The one drawback is the slave earbud (left side) occasionally has signal loss when I am riding bike with phone in pocket. It didn't matter which pocket (left or right front).

"I LOVE these! I was a little hesitant to get them because there were a couple of poor reviews regarding the microphone and ability to do phone calls with them but I have absolutely no problem with people hearing me and I’m told the sound quality is great! I only use two when I want to listen to music. The rest of the time I use the right earbud alone so I can also hear what is going around me. I also don’t like the way my own voice sounds with two. To use only one, take them both out of their case to let them connect to each other. Once the lights have all started blinking you can put the left one back in the case. I also had misunderstood how to charge them and thought after reading the reviews that I had to have a wireless charger so I got one. While it is really nice to have, I didn’t need it because there is a Lightning port and a short USB cord.",5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0

"The quality of sound on these buds is actually very impressive. After my beats wireless buds went bad I decided to get a cheaper set and these outperform the Beats earbuds on sound quality as well as volume. The major problem with these buds is the battery life. The description says you can get up to 7 hours of life on these things, but I have personally never gotten any more than 3 hours of life out of them. Also, the charger only charges them about two times on a full charge. Definitely disappointed, but I guess you get what you pay for.",2,1,2019-8-18,1,1,0

"These are hands down, the best earbuds for the money.  I have a hard time getting earbuds to stay in my ears and the only ones I've been able to keep in my ears are the apple airpods.  However, even those would at times slip out.  These earbuds stay in about the same as the airpods and have I believe,  better drivers which equal better sound quality.  The only caveat is the battery life.  They also lose their charge if you dont keep the case charged.  Wireless charging however, is a bonus.  I use them for a 45 minute run and 30 minutes of free weights after.  I've even left them in during my after workout shower just to test the water resistance and had no problems.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go.

After using them more it's obvious the sound channels leak into the opposite earbud (can hear scratchy low music tones from the left channel leaking into the right earbud) and the case has stopped holding a charge to where if it's not plugged in it will continuously drain until its dead (which will turn on the earbuds and drain those too). If they worked flawlessly for the price I'd say 5 stars but these are almost disposable earbuds at this point so... 1 star.

They block out most of the ambient sound, yet do allow me to hear things like cars that are approaching from behind with no problems.",5,1,2019-9-2,1,0,0
"Edit: I wanted to edit my review because I finally managed to get in contact with a customer service representative who was willing to help me. They shipped out a new pair of earbuds within 24 hours of my email, and they work great!TLDR: The earbuds are ok, but if you get a faulty pair like I did, their customer support is nightmarishly bad.",4,1,2019-5-25,1,0,0
"I have had my earbuds for over a week now they are really simple to set up on your phone, I like the variety of sizes they give you for your buds so they fit your ears, the quality is wonderful and the company it there to help you every step of the way if needed.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great set of earbuds for a very reasonable price.  They are also waterproof which is a great plus if your into swimming or you sweat a lot!",5,1,2019-8-8,1,0,0
I used this for only 4 months before it started not holding a charge and was no longer reliable on a regular basis. Today was the final straw. I should be able to make phone calls and use it on my runs (longest run was 12 miles) but it keeps not working. I came onto Amazon to get them returned but apparently the window to returns is closed. I definitely DO NOT recommend if you are going to be using them for longer than 4-6 months. Now I have to find a new pair and $40 doesn’t seem like a lot of money but to this mom of 7 every dollar counts.—-,1,1,2019-6-5,1,0,0
The owner has reached out to send me another pair free of charge because my set was defective. I will see if they stick to their word. I’m looking forward to writing a new review after I receive the new ones. I have received the new ones and they are working just fine. The owner made good on the replacement of the defective product and I’m quite happy with the ear buds . You should try them.,5,1,2019-4-8,1,1,0
"This is my first pair of wireless headphones. I have tried the airpods and they never stay in my ears. I tried a friends Bose and while they sounded good, the price scared me off. I have a couple pair of TaoTronics wired headphones and absolutely love them so I bought the Taotronics wireless earbuds as well at the same time as the Tozo T10. I tried the Taotronics first and got exactly what I wanted, affordable wireless ear buds that sounded good. I then put in the TozoT10's and was completely blown away at how good they sounded. It was like my ears were woken up. They sounded so good I had to try the Taotronics again to make sure I wasn't hearing things, I wasn't. These headphones sounded much better, I gave my wife the Taotronics and kept the Tozo for myself. The pairing process went exactly as they describe. I had no trouble connecting right to my ipad and iphone. I really feel like the twist motion will keep them in my ears when I workout. I always have a problem with phones falling out and my initial reaction is that these were very secure.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0
"I bought these for my wife after she saw and heard mine.  Yes, we have two pairs of these (different colors).  The sound is better than others that I have bought int he under $50 category.  They work great with my phone; conversations are clear.  Music sound great. Battery life is good.  The charging case is convenient and will recharge mine about 3x before needing to be plugged up.",5,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
"I've tried countless earbuds and nothing can stay in my ears. And, if they were wireless, I couldn't get the battery to last for 2 hours at the gym.This did all of that! I put them in and I could forget them. The blue tooth hooked up to my phone very easily (I had to struggle with other headphones), the battery lasted, and I wasn't spending the entire workout putting them back into my ears.",5,1,2019-7-8,1,0,0
"These are not for people with petite ears. I used the smallest earbud size and jammed them into my ears, but they would still fall out withing 30 seconds. I cannot fathom working out or traveling with these in. They are great in every other sense, they feel nice, the case is great, the sound is awesome. I just wish they weren't so big. Hopefully I can return these.",2,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"I am enjoying these earbuds quite a bit.  They are easy to pair, sound is good and I love that I can charge the charging case by placing it on my charging pad.  About the only thing that I think could use any improvement is how long the battery life is for the buds.  They last about 4 1/2 to 5 hours of use.  What I do is use only one at a time.  I listen to iHeart Radio all day while I'm at work so I switch out the buds half way through my day.  It is working out just fine.",5,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0
"For the price point you cannot be these! They have excellent sound quality and decent battery life. Love how you can recharge in the case without the case being plugged in. You can use them together or separately. They were easy to pair as well!

"I was a bit skeptical about these bluetooth earbuds before purchasing. However, after a few weeks of having them I can say they are great. I can either use one and for the money I'd say it's a great product. More than loud enough with good sound quality. Best of all they have quite a long battery life. I listened to over 5hrs straight and I still didn't have to charge them.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
"Not much of a music person.. but my Gosh, is this life changing. Cant get enough of wearing it, very comfortable, wont slip away due to interchangeable sizes available, user friendly. theyre almost undetectable while covered w/ my long black hair lol which is a plus at work. This is SO Awesome, Wish i bought this sooner!!! Get yours Now!",5,1,2020-3-1,1,1,1
"I have honestly tried several headphones and spent more than I did on these for headphones that I wasn't as happy with. The last ones being the JBL Reflect minis that don't even pair with Android phones. These came with excellent instructions, paired immediately, and the sound quality is fantastic. The fact that they're also waterproof is amazing and I'm so happy",5,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
After reading a lot of positive reviews I decided to order these headphones. I apparently have freakishly small ear canals because every other wireless headphones I’ve tried just fall out. Same thing happens when I try to use earplugs. I did try the smallest ear caps with this product and they still fell out but after trying it with no ear caps they fit. It didn’t feel uncomfortable so I’ll just wear them as is.,5,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0
"I've tried other wireless headphones but these are a step above in terms of sound quality and volume. The manual is in a very broken English which had me worried at first-- however the headphones are great. Half volume is plenty most of the time-- which is unlike any other wireless phones I've used.I wear them running on the treadmill, lifting, commuting, etc. They have only fallen out a couple of times when changing my shirt and knocking them out.",5,1,2019-4-8,1,0,0
"I wanted a pair of headphones that I could keep in when I got in the shower at the gym. These work great, and stay in my ear even when wet. (Once I found which of the four ear piece sizes worked best in my ear).Don't count on the microphone working great. I've had spotty success with calls. I usually end up switching back to my phone for calls, but since I'm not on the phone much, it's not a huge deal to me.",5,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0
"I just got these so I can’t speak to long term quality, but they paired With my iPhone instantly, and the sound quality is really impressive.  The bass is impressive, and the clarity is so good, I just noticed for the first time a background part in a song I’ve been listening to for over 30 years.  Everything feels solid, very happy with the purchase, especially considering the price.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"Typical earbuds do not fit/stay in my ears. I apparently have small ear canals. These come with a few different size plugs that go in your ears. The smallest size still doesn't fit correctly in my left ear but it fits well enough for my purposes.While doing farm, landscaping and construction work or simply chores around the house, I can comfortably wear these without cords getting tangled in plants or tools.",5,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0

"Tozo has truly created an incredible product. I have tried four different headsets (Beats, Diginex, Sony) and Tozo is by far my favorite. The earbuds don’t fall out easily, they fit nicely in my ears, the microphone picks up my voice well, and the sound quality is superb. The tone features good lows with an excellent high end. I am someone who enjoys good sound. I have installed GoogleHome products all over my house to have surround sound wherever you are in the house. Just so you have an idea of the kind of dude I am about sound. Water proofing on Tozos is legit. I work out a lot and sweat like a monster. I’ve worn Tozos lifting, running, rowing, biking, it doesn’t matter (Obviously not swimming [one could only hope]).  I couldn’t be happier, thanks Tozo. Will buy again.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"I got these for working out. They are comfortable and have multiple earbud sizes which is nice. I also sweat a lot, and these stay in and have thus far been effectively waterproof as far as I can tell. For the price, sound quality is great too. Wireless charging a nice plus as well!Update:",2,1,2019-1-23,1,0,0
"Had issue with T10 when using in my pool (left side fell out and after I retrieved from bottom of my pool it seems to short and have issues).  TOZO contracted me and offered replacement (they gave me the T6 which I feel is a little better, both sounds great, but maybe T6 sounds a little better bass  wise and balanced,  and has better case (smaller), and also T6 fits my ear a little better).  So 5 stars to TOZO for support and the T6 quality (I liked the T10 before I had the issue with the left ear bud).",5,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"Love the sound quality of these T10s. I bought these at my son’s recommendation to replace my worn out Apple AirPods which I have really enjoyed. I’ve never been a fan of in-ear headphones, which is my only complaint. I think I’m going to like them though. The bass doesn’t overpower the mids  and highs. Really nice soundscape. Listening to “Flamenco Sketches” by Miles and really enjoying it. These are awesome for modal jazz. Each instrument is clear and has its own “presence.” Peter Gabriel’s “Mercy Street” is as ethereal and haunting as it should be, maybe more. Lastly, Metallica’s “Enter Sandman” is all it should be! Very happy paying less than it would cost to replace ONE AirPod for a new complete headset!",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"The sound quality is amazing.  Best earbuds of any II've ever owned, not just for a $50 pair of earbuds but ANY, even sets where I've paid 2-3x the price.  Full base, great volume, good battery life.  SUPER comfortable even after a couple hours of use and they stay in my ears during workouts.  I love the IPX8 and the fact that I can wear them in hte shower or swimming.The only drawback is the the button functions on the earbuds are geared towards phone calls, not music - no FF/RW or volume.  Missing volume is not uncommon for true wireless but the lack of FF/RW is a big miss.  That said they are so good in every other respect I'm keeping them and would most definitely  buy them again.  Hopefully on their next version they fix the one shortcoming.",5,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
"Just received these. Shipping was fast. They came ready to go. Popped them in the charger bank to synch. My phone, Samsung note 10+, found them right away.

"I've tried a lot of different wireless earbuds and I own a running company. Hands down these are my absolute favorite when looking at form, fit and function. The fact that they have a charging station that holds the earbuds is simply amazing but the sound quality is excellent, plenty loud and has great bass. So far we have purchased two sets and would have zero hesitation recommending this to anyone. I have not received any compensation and do not often write reviews but wow these just blew me away as being phenomenal. Thanks Tozo!",5,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0
"Yes, I gave them a five.  I think the sound quality is so much better than a previous set of earbuds I bought.  I think a lot of is that the previous set lacked bass and these  are pretty darn good.Battery life is good, I'm pretty sure I got about 2.5 hours out of a charge.  I can verify that the wireless charging works like a charm, though my particular charger is a stand and I had to flip the case up vertically to start charging.  I got them at 20% off, so though more expensive than my previous set, I think this is the better buy.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
I got these as a replacement of my $200 Bose wireless headphones (I was an incompetent moron who lost a bud) and am pleasantly  surprised by the quality. The audio quality is pretty great for a $40 pair of headphones. The noise canceling is also very nice. The ear buds are comfortable and stay in nicely. I have always loved truly wireless products. Overall a great product for the price.,5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0

The sound is amazing with clear bass and well define upper register. At the time I write this review, I can only say that I didn't get to the end of the battery life and did not use the charge that the case carries.

"I'll make this brief.  These are great earbuds, IF they will stay connected.  If you browse through the reviews, you will see multiple people having the same problem.  They seem to situationally cut in and out constantly.  This only happens to me at the gym, but that's where I primarily use them.  It does not matter how good they sound, if they won't stay connected consistently.  After reading other reviews of people having the same issue, being sent a replacement, and still having the issue, I am sending these back and will try something else.Edit:  Editing to add correspondence with the company.  They offered me a $60 amazon gift card if I would remove or edit my review.  So, I am editing my review as they asked :).  I would keep this in mind if you decide to buy something from them...",2,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"I have purchased many electronic devices through Amazon before, but this is the first time I have ever posted a review.  I knew that these earbuds were very popular and had been reviewed very positively, but I never expected to be as satisfied as I am.  They arrived promptly and paired in no time at all.  What blew me away, however, is the sound quality.  The clarity and vibrant bass response comes very close to my Sony MDR 7506 headphones.  All I was looking for was a way to listen to music on occasion without getting tangled up in cords.  In other words, all I was looking for was utility, not sound quality.  How utterly amazing it is that I have not only done away with the cord, but I am actually enjoying the sound.  These are amazing, and when I factor in the price, I have to say that this is one of the best buys I have ever gotten on Amazon.",5,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"These are my first Bluetooth earbuds, although I've had several BT speakers and one BT headset for office use, so my grade reflects my new-ish-ness to this type of product.That said, I'm very happy with them. The pairing and setup are relatively foolproof, and the battery life has been sufficient for my usage over the first week+ of use. (Primarily, they've been used while watching movies on my iPad, so up to 2.5 hours continuous use leaves some power to spare.) The sound quality is good, though I may increase that to 5 stars as I get more experience and make alterations to the source EQ. Noise cancellation is as good as any earbuds I've ever owned, particularly once I finally figured out which sice of pads to use.",4,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
I have to admit that even with the reviews I wasn't sure what to expect.  When they arrived I opened the nicely packaged box and thought hmm.  The case is nice and sturdy and I love that the earbuds fit in snugly and the lid snaps closed.No issues at all pairing with my iPhone or iPad!  The sound quality is great and clear!  The only thing I wish it had that I haven't been able to figure out is how to mute other than using my phone.  This doesn't change my rating since the phone has to be within a certain distance.,5,1,2019-2-21,1,0,1
"The sound is great, as is the noise cancellation. The problem is that it cuts out, all the time. Turn my head, cuts out. Stay still, cuts out. When it works, it works great, the issue is that it cuts out so frequently that it really irritates me, which is the exact opposite of what I want my music to do. Also, as a side note, I have kept my phone in my pocket, and as close to them as in my bra, so it's not that the quality is fading due to distance.",2,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0

"This is my first pair of wireless earbuds. I’ve had numerous pairs of over the ear wireless earphones as well as wire ear buds.  I must say I’m extremely happy with this purchase. The ear buds arrived in one day. They were already charged and ready to go. They paired with my cell phone with no problems. I also paired them with my ipad. Because you can have two devices paired at the same time, I’m able to play music from my ipad while monitoring my phone as well.  I find the overall sound quality to be very clear and the bass is amazing. The range of the Bluetooth is excellent. I am able to walk around my home without the ipad and not loose the signal nor hear any degrading of the sound quality. I love the fact that the case pulls the earbuds in and locks them in place magnetically ensuring good contact while charging. There are 4 lights to show you the status of the charge/charging. The case is compact and easily fits in a pocket.  The earbuds have red lights to indicate they are charging and are out when fully charged. You can see these lights through the case top so no need to open it to check status.These are very high quality wireless earbuds that are well worth the money. I highly recommend them.",5,1,2019-8-9,1,0,0

These have only been used 4 days a week, 6 hrs a day.. for barely over 2 months.",1,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0
I use these for hydrotherapy / swim lessons to help my back. They help me concentrate on myself rather than the kids playing around in the pool.

"I ordered these and got a replacement shortly after, because the button didn't work to disconnect calls. The replacement actually has the same issue.

However, it's super inconvenient to carry the dongle and pulled the trigger on these wireless earbuds since it's got great ratings. And it is well-deserved. Immediately, you can feel the robustness of these earbuds as well as the case it comes with. The sound quality is much better than I was expecting at this price range. With the right ear silicon size, it fits snugly and do no fear it falling out. Definitely recommended.",5,1,2019-9-10,1,0,0
Bought this product instead of paying more for other brands.  Love the sound quality and battery life.  They do in fact connect really easily and I find them easy to use to turn music and podcasts on and off.BUT I wasn't able to use them to make phone calls - microphone quality seems terrible.  Also the slot to insert the microUSB for charging the case is needlessly deep and hard to fit at times.  I'm worried that when the port gets damaged over time they will become unchargeable.,4,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0

I only used it occasionally.Update: company reached out and sent new model (T6) (sent me one pair). So far it works well and is not giving issues. Sound is clear and bluetooth works great. Highly recommended. Will update if anything changes.",4,1,2020-3-25,1,0,0
"I decided to give these a chance because they were a little cheaper than the Alpha X200 ear buds that were stolen from me when someone broke into my car. The biggest pain in the butt for me was that the earbuds aren't synchronized and you have to connect both the right and left separately. They are also difficult to connect and I've never had any problems with any of my bluetooth devices. The sound quality is okay if you like to listen to your music very quietly because once you crank the volume up they can't handle it. They barely cancel out any noise in the background, While they were in I was able to hear my dog licking himself in another room in the house (and he's a corgi, not a big dog). The battery life is pretty good though. I'll give it that.",2,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
Update:Tozo reached out to me  in regards to my initial post. They sent me the updated T10 version and they work fantastic. This is exceptional in my book.

The main problem is they don’t fit well in his ears and although it says there are different size pieces you can use to hold them in, his pair did not come with any different size earpieces. I’ve trying to figure out how to get them from the seller but haven’t had a response.",4,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
The case is very sturdy and well made. Set up was a breeze.The fit of the headphones is great! It comes with various size ear-pads so you can pick what suits you most comfortably. These headphones cancel sound well for the listener and also do a good job keeping the sound down for folks around the listener.,5,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0
"I have used a number of different headphones, headsets, and wired to each other earbuds over the years. However, this is my first set of truly wireless earbuds and I must say I am impressed. This is only day 1, but the sound quality is as good as any other headset I have used. I have tested them with podcasts, music, and YouTube videos. There was no noticeable audio lag. For the price, I have trouble believing there is a better value out there.They were easy to pair, I just set them in the case for a second, took them back out and phone recognized them in seconds. There were 4 different sizes of silicone ear buds (adapters? the part that physically goes in your ear)",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
I've owned a lot of bluetooth headphones/headsets and have been disappointed by all of them. I'm a bass player and all these headphones came up woefully short on the bottom end. Then I bought THESE. The sound is AMAZING!!! So crystal clear and perfect bottom end! 4 hour battery life. Ridiculously lightweight in the ears. Seriously the BEST bluetooth ear experience I have ever had!,5,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"I am not a connoisseur of all things headphones but I have listened to my fair share, (Air Pods, Beats etc). These are a LARGE step below the ones mentioned. The first thing I noticed is they have WAY TOO MUCH high end. I haven't figured out how to bring more bottom in other than adjust my iPhone settings.  Listening to music on these isn't an option for me. I have relegated them to simply listening to audio books. The BT connection can be good or bad depending upon the day. I have had to delete the connections and reestablish them more than once.  I seriously contemplated sending them back for a refund but ended up keeping them just because of how many audio books I listen to. If you're looking for a good sounding BT wireless headphones I wouldn't recommend these. Who knows maybe I got a faulty pair but from what I received they aren't very good.",3,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"I was tired of using corded earbuds because of their constantly getting caught on things and being yanked out as I was trying to work. Nothing worse than when you're in the middle of a project  (think doing the dishes, changing the oil in the car, mowing the lawn) and in the middle of a fave song when suddenly the shock when an earbud is caught on something and suddenly yanked out of your ear. Oh, the horror. Well, now I am much more free and able to do more with these particular wireless earbuds. They pair quickly, charge quickly, and the sounds quality is as good as my previous $30 earbuds but of course, these are wireless. Well worth the money and easy to use. This is my 1st Bluetooth anything and so I am looking forward to streaming with other devices. Tozo makes an excellent product, here. Highly recommend for your first or 2nd or 3rd wireless earbud purchase. Give them a try. I'm sure you'll be as satisfied as I am.",5,1,2019-9-11,1,0,0
"These little things are pretty good for their price. The multiple earbud sizes are a plus (I actually had to go up myself to get a perfect fit). As they are earbuds, the noise canceling is excellent as the buds penetrate your ear canal. Sound quality is really good, although I think the bass is slightly high. There are also no controls on the earbuds themselves to advance tracks if you are listening to music; you have to do that from the actual device it is paired to. I made a test call and the microphone seems to work well if you speak at your normal conversational tone.  The charger is great: waterproof, can hold 4 full charges, is magnetic to hold the buds in place while charging, you can see the status of the charge (red/blue) through the lid of the case, and can see how many charges the case has left. They also included a little lanyard for the case if you want to use it. I haven't used them much yet, but they fit well, snug, and will work well for what I need them for.",5,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0
"I got these, and I was super excited to try them out. However, after 2 seconds of use, I realized that the right earbud was significantly quieter than the left. I managed to fix this by adjusting the output through my phone so that the left was outputting left, but overall I'm disappointed. The sound quality is ok, and the battery life is fine, but honestly, for 35 dollars I was expecting much more than a broken pair of earbuds.  I'm hoping I just got a faulty product.UPDATE: I returned the faulty pair and got new ones that work much better. The sound quality is good enough to satisfy me, a low-key audiophile, and the battery life is nothing to sneeze at either. They stay comfortably in my ears, which is a nice bonus for me. The mic isn't the greatest and I would not recommend using it, but for wireless earbuds, a built-in mic is a very handy convenience.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0

"I got this headphones for hands free calling. They work great for listening to music or audio but the pairing has been a nightmare. Sounds quality is good and so is the battery life. I gave two stars because the pairing is the hardest part. Here are my general issues:1. Auto pairing with phone: I was not able to connect these automatically to my phone. Sometimes, I paid one headset auto and then have to restart the headset to pair both. It requires me to turn off Bluetooth and then turn back on.",2,1,2019-6-26,1,0,0
"Unfortunately, maybe its due to bluetooth limitations, but the left earbud always cuts out randomly and comes in, via movement, doing nothing, etc. The right earbud always works however, so there is that. The earbuds overall are pretty good for the price that was given, and functions as advertised, but I did not test water.Overall, if the left earbud did not always cut out randomly consistently, it would have been 5*.",3,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"Sounds good, little bulky for my ears but the sound is really good. Enough bass. My right side slips off a lot no matter how I wear it, it gets a little uncomfortable while working out. But if you’re not doing high intense workouts, the ear phones are fine. Went sprinting, sweat of course kept getting right side to slip. Maybe it’s my ears but I have smaller ears (female) or maybe the shape that makes it a bit uncomfortable. Almost a sore to my ear.",4,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
I brought these just because of the reviews so i took a gamble so all the reviews are correct the only issue I had was paring with my phone but once my provider help me with this I was truly amazed by these I did used the smaller ear set and they fit perfect Im trurly amazed by these ear plugs I highly recommend buying them also please but that I'm not getting paid to make this review,5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"I had been wanting a decent pair of bluetooth earbuds for a while, and these fit the bill quite nicely. I’ve only had them for about a week, they do a good job of noise-cancelling, the bass is pretty deep for the price point, and they’re comfortable to wear for longer periods of time, which is something I can’t say for the Apple EarPods. I love how the case can be wirelessly charged, and the case itself holds enough of a charge to fully re-charge the buds a few times, which is super cool. Haven’t tried out the waterproof aspect of it and probably won’t, because I don’t feel the need to use them while showering or swimming. All in all, I’m really happy with them, especially for the price I paid!",5,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"I don't know if it's because my ears are waxy or just oddly shaped, but earphones never really stayed in my ears.  These ones though....  I LOVE them.  Great quality sound, and they don't budge, must be the awesome design.  Plus, I can set the case on my wireless charger.  Seriously, not only earphones that I've ever actually liked, but LOVED.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"Just got the pair yesterday, tried them on doing great. It is well balance for its price. After the next day of use, right side ear piece started having issues. It’s out of sync with each other, and the right has volume issues compared to the left. Read the manual that piece should only connect to the device, and didn’t matter whether I connected to the LH or RH piece. Tried connecting both at the same time didn’t help either. Next, the charger cover is too difficult to remove. Also the charging port cover is held in pretty tight to keep water or dirt out which is nice. However, the tab used to help open the cover is too small, when trying to open the cover its strain the tab to the point of tearing it. Opening the cover is difficult, due to the small tab, tried my best to carefully not strain the tab of the cover.  Which, as predicted the tab did tear due to the strain. It would be nice if there was a better way to open cover. Finally, position of the buds is always a concern, when the position is wrong, the bud won’t play any. As a result I returned them.",2,1,2019-6-7,1,0,1
"I really like these but they are too big for my ears. They fall out. They are hard to pair with my Ipad and you have to do it each time you use them. The sound is great though and I would love them if they fit my ears. Even with the smallest little pads, they fall out of my ears.  UPDATE: This company has reached out to me and offered to replace the earphones. Wonderful customer service, unlike any I have had for a long time...",5,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
I got these earbuds a little less than a week ago and have tried it out every night both while working out and while cooking/cleaning.  Here are my thoughts on it:-- SOUND QUALITY --,4,1,2019-3-14,1,0,0
"For the price of these headphones being around $50, you get a lot of  features. Unlike another pair of similar headphones I bought, they do not have connection issues between the two headphones when out walking, and the distance to the main bluetooth device can also be quite far. I really like the waterproofing, a great thing to be able to use them without worries of damages. The case that they charge in is really solid as well, and the wireless charging in it can also be very convenient.The shape of the headphones is slightly bulky, or I guess larger than similar headphones, but the bass response on these headphones is good. Audio quality in general is quite good, not balanced or perfect, but great for the price. Also the shape of the tips included cover a good range of ear sizes, and different tips can also be used and fit in the case, as the hole for the headphones is quite large.",4,1,2019-6-11,1,0,0
"These headphones work like a charm! With their amazing sound quality and noise cancellation, it truly matches the description provided. I’ve had them for over a month, and they’ve paired great, the only thing is that these headphones might not pair with each other after a certain time. It did end up happening to me, and so I contacted TOZO Services. They rapidly helped me with the issue (which was a short circuit in the headphones) by sending over new ones, and they’ve worked as well as the old ones.*Edited* The replacements I received lasted over 7 months, and then the same situation happened again, this time the right channel wasn't working properly and the voice that says ""right channel"" sounded slow/deep. So I emailed them again, and once again received great service from their customer service aide, (Jude) who helped me with the issue. I utimately bought a new pair to replace the old ones, overall: worth the buy!",4,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0
I bought these after my Beats Pro earbuds were stolen. I just wanted a cheapish pair to tide me over until the new AirPods were launched. I am so happy with these that I don't want to do that anymore. They fit exceptionally well and provide a good seal thanks to the super soft silicon caps that come in different sizes. They are small and discrete yet are much louder than the Beats. The sound quality is exceptional too.,5,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"The earbud charging case blue lights will come on by themselves even if the earbuds are fully charged. Also the blue lights on case will stay on for a long time after I unplug the usb charging cable after a fully charge. Because of the blue lights remaining on for awhile, I lose a full charge cycle. So instead of 4 charges I’m down to 3. Intermittently the left earbud cuts in and out. When this happens, it is extremely annoying.  I have tried resetting everything and these issues still occur.",2,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0
"After REFUSING to pay $200 for Apple’s AirPods, I decided to give these gems a try. They are fantastic. They fit great and sound great. The case is of good quality, as well. There’s the occasional glitch where the sound drops when I unlock and re-lock the screen while music is playing, but it’s only for about a tenth of a second, so it’s more of a minor annoyance than anything else. These are well-worth $50. I even ordered a second pair for my daughter!",5,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0
"This manufacturer has manufacturer quality control issues. The headphones weren't dropped  and just stopped working with intermittent sound in right ear. Probably a cold solder joint. Will not buy this brand or products from this manufacturer again. Threw away my box already, so I probably won't bother returning. $50 wasted....",1,1,2019-6-1,1,2,0
"I really like these earbuds. The sound quality is exceptional, especially if you get your own foam earpieces (I recommend memory foam as it adds to the comfort and improves noise cancelation). I never really had an issue with distance, it is about 20 feet if you're in a different room. I LOVE the waterproof feature. I can wear these on my run when it is raining without worry, as well as the shower. However, they don't stay in your ear very well in the shower, as the silicone doesn't grab your ear well. Still stay in well for workouts.My only issue is the battery life. With constant music playtime it's about 3 hours max until you have to charge them again which is a little annoying sometimes, but manageable since they charge quickly (full charge in less than an hour).  If you just pop them in the case when you're not using them you'll never have too much of a problem with battery life.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
If you're looking for a good pair of earbuds for a reasonable price then look no further because I don't think you're going to find a better pair for less money.I've owned or tried a few different in the ear style earbuds and these are the most comfortable and best sounding I've experienced so far.

"These worked very well for me for about two months. Good fit, good sound quality, decent battery life. Recently, the left earbud stopped working/charging. It used to be solid red while charging, then after cutting out while in use, it began rapidly flashing red & blue while charging, and now it does not light up while in the charging case and doesn't function.This happened after my Amazon return window, so I contacted TOZO directly and they are sending me a new pair free of charge. They don't even want the old pair back, which is nice. This is good customer service and I will update when I receive my replacement pair. Hopefully I won't have the same issues.",3,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0

I read the specs and decided to take a chance on it. They arrived in this beautiful package, tried the eabuds on , and I was amazed.

"I'm very happy with these. When you consider price point vs features, these buds excel in quality and performance. Pairing was a breeze. I love they way they auto turn on and off when removed and replaced in the case. Use one earpiece or two. These buds are smart enough to know your choice with no extra clicks or buttons to push. Music and voice navigation is easy. The case is compact and light. I can charge it on the weekend and use it at work all week. If you're looking for value, this is it.",5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0

Junk.. don’t buy. Left earbud has very weak connection to right earbud.Constant audio drop-outs and stuttering. Attempted multiple devices with same results.

"These are definitely the most quality completely wireless earbuds I've bought in this price range. Considering that they're advertised as ""Deep bass for Sport"" they perform as promised and even a little more. I did have some doubts because they were advertised that way, but they vanished when I pressed play. I was relieved and truthfully a little surprised. So full points there.I bought them for the gym. They stay secure whenever I'm doing resistance training and any cardio that isn't running. However, if you do run and begin to sweat, that combined with the impact from running cause them to start dislodging from your ear. I expected as much so it wasn't a deal breaker for me but if that's a problem for you, now you know.",5,1,2019-6-26,1,0,0
These earbuds were very disappointing. The packaging was well done. The earbuds pair easily and automatically connected when taken out of the charger.

This is my second pair of the T10 wireless earbuds; I misplaced my first pair about a couple months after using them almost every day and enjoying every minute. Then couldn't find them and couldn't live without them so had to buy another pair! So reasonably priced, I didn't even flinch at getting a second pair (though still hoping I find the first pair!)Sound quality is excellent, especially if you like your bass as I do. Bluetooth pairing is quick and easy and the connection is rock solid with my phone in front, side or back pocket.

Highs tend to be drowned out by the lows although they do seem to have a ""break in"" period. Bluetooth range is terrible though. It cuts out with my phone just in my pants pocket similar to early bluetooth headsets from 10 years ago which makes me wonder if it's actually bluetooth 5.0. Both sides are in perfect sync though",4,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0
I love that I can use these on either ear. I mostly use in my left and just switch them out. They connect easily even when switching as each ear connects independently.

"I've always had difficulties finding a set of earbuds that fit comfortably and sound good, at a convenient price. I've bought many pairs over the years that would have a tendency to pop out of my ear, even changing to the different size inserts. I've resorted to buying the corded buds with the ear loop. These would become uncomfortable after awhile and just didn't want to mess with them. I was using a pair of padded, over the ear headphones at the gym but didn't have a good Bluetooth earbud solution until I got these TOZO T10s!

I eventually took it out and laid  it next to my phone to dry off and went back to swimming. When I got out of the pool I tried to put them back in my ear but it wouldnt come back on. 2 hours later the right ear piece will still not come on. I'm so sad!!!

However, most of these issues were solved quickly by their customer service or Amazon.",5,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"TOZO has pretty much the best customer service experience of any company we've worked with. We ordered a pair of these waterproof headphones in July, used them heavily for 2-3 months before the left side stopped one working one fine rainy day in August. We had kept the warranty card that came with the headphones, and noticed that we did not ""register"" our device within 14 days of receiving the item. Despite that, we emailed TOZO anyway since the warranty is for 1 year, and asked if they'd be willing to replace the product. Within hours, a representative assured us that we could, and within 2 days we had a fully functional new set, and there was nothing more to be done. High-quality headphones, even higher quality customer support. Thanks, TOZO!",5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"These were a Christmas gift to myself. I listen to music, audible books, and podcasts. I LOVE these! The bass is really good as is the noise-cancelling function. I also like the fact that the earbuds can be used and charged separately without the case having to be connected to a charger. I HIGHLY recommend these earbuds! (I also purchased the service plan just-in-case there are problems.)",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"Bought these because they were inexpensive compared to my Airpods, which were slowly giving out.  VERY happy with this product in the first few days of owning - stood up to sweat just fine, sound is good, charge lasts AST LEAST 2.5 hours, and they are easy to use.  Very happy with the purchase, and if they stay at this price point, a GREAT value.",5,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
"As a college student, I was looking for something affordable that was not air pods (they are too expensive for me). I got these earbuds with hopes of them being good quality for a nice price, and that is exactly what I got. I have had these for about 3-4 months now with no problems (knock on wood). They have lived up to all of their promises and delivered on all their expectations. I bought a 3 year warranty with them thinking I might need them within the first month, but this has not been the case whatsoever. If you're looking for quality at a low price you have found it.The only complaint I have is the battery life. It does last 3.5 hours, and with 10-20 minutes in the charger they'll last another hour easy, but I wish the battery life was longer. Besides this one thing, I think this product is one of the better ones in this price range. Talking is easy, noise cancellation is great, and the sound quality is perfect. You can connect one ear bud at a time or both at the same time, it is perfect!",4,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"I was looking for a suitable alternative to RayCons. These are ok. They certainly don’t fit in your ear like the raycons, so that makes them a little awkward. Sounds is fine, battery like is fine - need to charge them at least 2x a week.Overall, my biggest complaint is the the fit, but for the price I would buy again.",4,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
"I bought these earbuds because of my work which involves surveillance’s. Holding a phone to your ear while following someone is unacceptable. These earbuds fit better than any other Bluetooth ear piece. They stay firmly in your ear even during moderate activity. Additionally the sound that you hear, and the sound the receiver heard is great quality. The one button push operation makes these buds very practical.",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"After continuous use the last 4 months I’ve been very impressed with this product. No it won’t win any Apple style points but it’s been dependable and easy to use across many devices.PROS:  Easy set-up, pairing, comfortable fit, good sound quality, more than decent battery life",4,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
"They're very loud and clear.  The reason why I'm giving it 3 starts is because like with all other buds this manufacturers seem to not tests these devices on actual human beings.I have bought about 5 pairs on the last six months and none seen to fit my ears.  All different brands, but they seem to make them for people that have small ear holes or lobes, whatever the word.",3,1,2019-12-22,1,0,0
"I always look at review and the number of responses when shopping so I was very surprised and disappointed with this buds. These were used for meetings while working form home and after two weeks they would stop transmitting sound after 5 minutes of the meeting, even if they were taken off the charger right before the meeting and fully charged.",1,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"I mostly use these for listening to music at work and have been largely impressed. The sound quality is great and the container they are stored in is small enough to throw in a pocket when not in use. The case automatically recharges them while they are put away, and can fully charge a depleted battery around 3 times before it needs plugged in to a power source. Overall if you're not using these for high end audio purposes you really can't go wrong they are well worth their price",5,1,2019-11-25,1,1,0
Very sleek design I love how easy it is to connect and the built in battery with the case makes it to where it’s super easy to charge them and the fact I can only wear one if I want to while I’m working makes this a great purchase for me as a mechanic getting wires caught is a real threat and this solves that issues would def recommend,5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,1
"Sound quality is pretty decent. As is the noise cancellation. Depending on how loud I have the music playing, I cannot hear A N Y T H I N G around me. So good job TOZO. Battery life is decent but could be better. They only last about 4 hours before they need to be charged again. They are small and easy enough to workout with. The waterproof aspect is good too. My biggest issue with the earbuds is that the range is not great. I can't be too far from the device its connected to otherwise the bluetooth connection gets all choppy.",4,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
I was looking for a pair of Bluetooth earbuds for work.  I work outside so being sweat and water proof is a huge plus. I don't like to wear Ipod earbuds… they hurt my ears too much.  These fit really well like a soft ear plug so I dont get that ear pain from wearing them for any amount of time.  I connected them to my phone very easily.  The case is also very nice with an optional lanyard to wear it around your neck.,5,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
I wanted to like this but just cant! I have had others that are way better and cheaper. I hate that the box needs to to be near by and you need to have both devises on and out of the box for that super annoying beeping every 10ish seconds to go away. I go for runs and as a girl I cant put 2 in my ears as it's a safety hazard but having to hold the box and the extra bud is stupid. The sound is pretty good but unusable for my needs,2,1,2019-9-14,1,0,0
Not completely happy with these. I received them 3 days ago. I certainly wouldn't say they are noise cancelling at all and they make a crackling sound quite often so the sound quality is not the best. I love the fit and the charging case. The easily sync to my phone after the first time or two and occasionally they wont sync together but it's not difficult to fix. They aren't the worst but also aren't the best by far.,3,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"These earbuds are awesome! Especially for the price! They stay in my ears with no issues. Sounds quality is excellent! It’s like a perfect balance between bass and rich sound quality. The noise cancellation works way better than my AirPods (original). Setup, pairing and installation was easy. I paired these to my iPhone and PC and the perform very well with both. Overall VERY great value!! I might get another pair, just because! Lol",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"I owned this earbuds for 5 months and both earbuds started to drop connection randomly in the last 2 weeks. They sometimes work and sometimes doesn't. I am really upset as I actually really liked these earbuds but they died in 5 months. I use them an hour a day when I am walking so I was very gentle with them. Since the return window is closed, I will try to connect the manufacturer for a solution.",1,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"I have only had these earbuds for a day, but I’m super impressed!! They charged pretty quickly, and I absolutely LOVE the sound quality. I like to listen to loud music with a good bass, so this is important when looking for headphones. I tend to purchase skull candy earbuds, but those have been notorious for not lasting longer than a few months, at least for me.. I decided I wanted something cordless this time around since my iPhone no longer has the headphone jack and I HATE having to bring an adapter everywhere. The sound is great, the noise cancellation is amazing when music or a podcast is playing. I can’t say much for the battery life, yet, since I’ve only had them for a short time. For the price, this is the way to go if your ears like this style of ear bud!",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"Purchasing these headphones were worth it. Pros - wireless, minimal issues pairing, and while they are not noise-cancelling, they are in-ear so they block a lot of the outside noise. Cons - a little bulky of a fit, but that's kind of to be expected. The other thing, while not exactly a con, is that they are quite loud. I keep them on the lowest volume most of the time, otherwise I think they probably would be bad for your ears. Overall, would definitely purchase again.",5,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"I didn’t know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised and impressed! These things work right out of the box and sound amazing! I couldn’t believe how much bass you could feel from them considering their sizes! Really awesome wireless earbuds at a great price! I’ll update if I have more to say on the battery life, but for now, they’re pretty impressive!! Highly recommend them if you’re on the fence!",5,1,2019-11-13,1,0,1
These are pretty decent for the price. I personally wasn't crazy about the pairing procedure and find them a bit confusing for turning them on and off. I don't think the software is the best to be honest. But I gave them to my wife and she likes them a lot. She uses them everyday and has no problems with them (I'm more picky lol).,4,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
Disappointed that the left ear bud is no longer working. It is just dead. DEAD! i have owned this all of two months and only got to enjoy them for about 5 times. Out of the return window... this is now a waste of money. I had bought this so I can enjoy while swimming. It is waterproof but the sound paused as soon as head is in the water. I kept it anyway as a spare and just for those days I want to hangout in the pool. Bah... no chance of that.,1,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"I never even got through the set-up of these because they wouldn't stay in my ears. So I can't provide a proper review.That being said, know what kind of ear buds typically work for you. If you tend to use a kind like these, you'll be fine (probably).",4,1,2019-3-21,1,0,0
"I was looking at all kinds of wireless earbuds and I wasn't really even on a budget. I kept coming back to these and after all the positive and even rave reviews, which I didn't find on earbuds four to five times more expensive, I decided to get these ones. Even after everything I read, they still blew me away. I was not expecting such great sound quality. I was so excited, that I brought them to work and had planned to just wear one earbud, but I had to hear a couple of songs with all their sounds so I ended up with both earbuds in. I was having a grand time until a coworker had a question and scared the living tar out of me. I didn't hear him knock or come in, so I can definitely say the noise cancellation is good.The ultimate test though was running - which was the primary purpose for these. I ran with the right ear bud in and no connectivity problems and I don't think the earbud moved at all, even after tripping over my dog and taking a tumble in the snow.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"You get what you pay for. Although the sound quality initially was great, within 90 days the left earbud began cutting in and out. I thought maybe it wasn’t making a good charging connection but it appears to charge then is dead when I go to use it. The battery life isn’t great either. My advice? Step up to a known electronics maker.",3,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0
"I’ve been researching wireless earbuds for the past few years. I tried another brand a couple years ago and they were a huge disappointment. I understand why these are Amazon’s Choice and why they are at almost 5 stars with over 4,000 reviews. These earbuds are super comfortable, with different rubber ear pieces to make sure you have the perfect fit, but the sound is phenomenal. I have wireless Beats by Dre, and those are wonderful, but I wanted something much smaller, with comparable sound quality. These are it. And a fraction of the price.I couldn’t recommend these enough to anyone looking for easy-to-use, yet great-looking wireless ear buds. The charging box they come with is an added bonus too, and so easy to carry around!",5,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0
"Initial impression, glad I found these ear buds.  I was considering a much more expensive option, when I saw the great reviews for the Tozo T10.  The sound is so much better than my previous Bluetooth Earbuds and the connection was very easy.  The charging station is very convenient assuring they are always fully charged when I need them. Like many reviewers said, they fit well in your ears, I have no concern of them falling out.  Compared to JBL, these are quality earbuds at a reasonable price.",5,1,2019-6-15,1,0,0
The battery on a good day last's about 3 hours. I work in a very noisy office and always need to listen to something. My last set of headphones that I had finally died after 10 hours a day for 2 years. The sound quality is not very good either. Sometimes it sounds (if on a phone call) as if they are around the corner and you have to strain to hear. I realize I did not spend a lot of money on these but the last pair that I paid $10.00 for had amazing sound and would with stand my 10 hour work day.,3,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"I love these except they barely work. I loose signal if I turn my head or put my hand between while carrying phone in a run belt.The fit is nice, they are light, and the wireless charging is a nice feature. I really want to love these but loosing signal so easily is extremely disappointing.",4,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
These are amazing. I love the noise cancelation feature. it does it's job wonderfully. I also love the fact that you don't have to turn the volume all the way up to get the full feel of your music. Phone calls are clear. With other low priced earbuds. The people I'd be talking to would often complain that they couldn't hear me well. NOT WITH THESE. SO far they've been an absolute pleasure to own. I can't comment on the battery life because I don't wear the too long. Only for about 3-4 hours. But i'm sure they'll pass my test. Not sure if there is a volume function  on the buds themselves....,5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"These are my first pair of wireless ear buds. I wear them at work and I bought them after I got annoyed having to take out my headphones every time I got up from my desk because I had to keep my phone plugged in. Don't get a new phone, get new ear buds.My son picked these out for me because he saw that I struggled with less tactic ear buds. With these, I don't have to try to figure out where to wave my finger at to get the song to pause or answer my phone. I just have to press the buds and not only can I control what I'm doing, I know what I'm doing.",5,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"The sound quality is decent, maybe it's just because I have sensitive ears but I envy all the reviews that mention no static because for me it depends entirely on what song is being listened to. The higher the tone of the song, the higher likelihood there will be staticIn all honesty, I probably wouldn't recommend this product on its own due to its iffy consistency, but considering how much the seller is willing to work with people who have issues, I'd say go for it because even if there are problems, the seller will make them right.",5,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"I needed wireless earbuds that would withstand a whole day in the garden or a morning jog! I personally find AirPods to be uncomfortable after a long period of time! I checked these out and I was skeptical because of the awesome price. I received them today, they are so comfortable.. you can almost forget they are in your ear. I’ve played them through several genres of music and the sound is not bad considering the price point! I’m happy and I would suggest if you are thinking about grabbing these... you won’t be disappointed!",5,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
"These sound pretty good when they are working. Bass heavy which I expected from other reviews.I have a problem with these where the left earbuds cuts off very often. Pretty much whenever I look to the right even though my phone (Galaxy S10) is in my left pocket. Can't understand why but it happens very consistently and makes it so the listening experience is poor. I'm not sure if I have a defective unit or it is a design flaw, but I do see other people with the same complaint, so I'm going to return these and they a different brand.",2,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0
These earbuds are amazing.  I could tell from the way they were packaged that this was going to be a quality product.  Once you find the right size earbud attachment they are very comfortable and they stay in your ear.  The sound quality is great and they even have good bass.  I put one of these in my ear and an airpod in my other ear and I could honestly not tell the difference.  I had my wife who has never tried either before do a blind test and she picked the TOZO brand stating that they were more comfortable and had better bass.  For a quarter of the price of a second generation airpod you get a similar product that is waterproof!  I would definitely recommend this product! Great customer service too!,5,1,2019-3-29,1,0,0
"I’ve been looking for some good in your ear buns versus the Apple style AirPods and my friend showed me these TOZO earbuds. They are stellar regarding battery life, sound quality, and reliability. They seamlessly connect and reconnect when I walk away from my phone. I can go all day using these without charging them in the case. Why would I buy overpriced AirPods that don’t even fit snuggly in my ears when I can use these for hours at a time?I’d say, buy these and you’ll be content for a long time.",5,1,2020-3-11,1,1,0
"I got these to replace my non waterproof buds I had before and I'm so happy about it. I use them at work and then move to the gym and they are amazing.

No problem these bad boys didn't miss a beat even in the sauna.",5,1,2019-5-10,1,0,1
I had these for about a week and a half. They woked when I was on the beach just walking around. After the first week I tried to work out in them. After my first work out with them I notice that my earbud had looked vieny and the sound became staticy. As you can see from the pictures one is worse than the other.  This because I was sweating more on my right ear then my left.,1,1,2020-6-24,1,1,1
"Wow! This are very nice! I compared them to the Apple AirPods and these pair is way better. Better sound quality, sound canceling, very comfortable and easy to use.

Great product for a great price 😀😀🎉🎊",5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"The sound quality is quite good and seems to last a long time. While I have tried different sized inserts, I have never gotten so confident that I could do too much activity without losing one or both of them. Not that I jog, but I can't imagine them staying in place. I'm prepared for this to be operator error and me not getting it down yet, so I will continue to use them. Perhaps I will eventually learn to play the violin and jog!? I was very impressed with the holder/charger and the overall quality of the construction and most importantly the sound.",5,1,2020-9-29,1,0,0
"This product looks very sleek and high quality.  The ease of syncing to Bluetooth is as simple as it gets.  They cancel outside noise very well and the sound quality is great.The reason I didn't give full 5 stars is that I have noticed that while the sound is great quality, people I call often say they cannot hear me very well so I end up taking them off and just using my phone directly.  I'm not sure if there's a setting I can adjust to have a stronger microphone, but that's been the biggest issue.  For listening to music, however, the headphones are great.",4,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
"Great sound with strong bass. Battery life a little short, normally get around an hour into my jog before they go in the case/charger but they recharge quickly.

"These do not stop dying. The case charges them, but it never stops charging them. It continues to attempt to charge until it dies, and then the earbuds die. It has been like that sense I got then. Basically if I know I'm going to use them I have to leave them on the charger the day before. They will die on their own in a day without use in the fully charged case.",1,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"Tozo gave me these buds to check out.  I have not used ear buds before.  I was really happy that they paired and worked right away.  I think sound quality is good and the volume range is good.  I was frustrated when I tried them later and couldn’t get them to work.  Found out they were pairing to my iPad instead of my iPhone.  That wasn’t their fault, it was mine.  Once I got the hang of the touch control it is great. Its nice that their case will charge them without reconnecting to usb connection and that the case recharges wirelessly also.  I definitely would recommend.",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
I bought the Tozo T10 airbuds for my husband and so far he is completely satisfied.  It was listed for $49.99 and the $15 coupon made this option even more attractive.  The clarity of the sound is amazing and the bass experience is the real deal. I have tried it on my tablet as well and the background sounds were crisp and clear. I’m still to try it on our smart tv.Paring to our phones and tablets was simple and the varying earbud sizes were a welcome.,5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
When buying something at this pricepoint you always have to keep this cost in mind.Sound is fair- I have a pair of Bose but the battery went kaput so I got these just to try.

I've been able to get about 3 1/2 charges out of the case before charging again overnight. The earbuds turn on and pair with your phone as soon as you detach them from the case, they are magnetic so attach to the case very well with little chance of anything falling out. Haven't tested waterproofness yet but they seem well built and so far sweatproof. GREAT SOUND QUALITY! Will not go back to wired buds after wearing these! Great product!",5,1,2019-9-27,1,0,0
"The sound quality of these earbuds are amazing. The battery life is not that great, I only get between two to three hours of use per full charge. As far as comfort goes, they are extremely comfortable and they stay put well. The main reason for my 5 star review is due to the extremely great customer service that I have experienced. They are quick to return emails and VERY fast to replace a defective device.",4,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
"I really enjoy these! So much cheaper Apple and Bose. The setup reminds me of Bose though. You can take phone calls on this, it’s waterproof (to an extent of course) and I can’t hear anything around me if I have both headphones on! I like my music loud, and with it almost all the way up my family can’t hear my music. Which is good for them and me lol!

And the battery life is awesome, I was on the tractor for 5 hours with a less than 100% charge on the buds and they lasted 5 hours...no telling how much longer they would have lasted with a 100% charge. I also bought these because I specifically searched for small buds because I have such small ears. These were recommended. I use the smallest ear insert and they stay in place...FINALLY a pair that does not fall out of my ears. Save your money from buying the $100 ones and BUY THESE!",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0

Sound quality is perfectly fine for music, podcasts, video etc. They hook up, pair and sync instantaneously when you take them out. Charging case is durable. Battery life hasn't been an issue at all.

I’ve had AirPods 1 for about 2 years and started becoming frustrated with the ever declining battery life and with how long it takes to connect to my phone (and not to mention the constant disconnecting).I decided I wanted to try another brand that doesn’t charge over $100 just in case the experience would be the same. I’m so happy to say that these headphones were easy to connect on first setup, connect to my phone quickly and offer features that AirPods 1 don’t such as noise cancelling. They also offer features I’ve been dying to have in a wireless earbud which is waterproof and volume control. Prayers have been answered!

I broadcasted music from my Fitbit, the distance was less than a feet in any given time, and the connection never worked properly.",1,1,2019-2-26,1,3,0
Bought these earbuds for Christmas based on all the positive reviews and so glad i did. Happy they include a few different size buds to fit into ear as i needed the smallest size and it fits just perfect for me..i also love that when you place in the ears a voice lets you know right channel then left channel is connected...excellent quality sound is the topper. Very happy with purchase,5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"I recently purchased a pair of these headphones based on reviews. After receiving the first pair, the battery life was about 3-4 hours which was much less then advertised.I ordered a replacement to find the 2nd pair after charging more then 8 hours did not last on a flight from LA to Dallas (roughly 2-2.5 hrs)",1,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
"First, I have to say that the sound of the T10 is ok, no  complains about that. You must know that this phone has no controls but play and pause. You cant skip music or change the volume. You have to do it in your source. But the problem is that the left earbud stopped working a few months after use. It does not connect with the right one anymore. Could not figure out a way to solve the problem, but TOZO support sent me a new earbud, no charges, so I have to say, their support is ok and I am ok with them.",5,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"The sound quality, range, battery life and comfort are all really decent for the price point.I had a special experience with these though. I don't know if it's a common problem or not but after 6-7 months of very frequent (4+ hours a day) usage the left earbud stopped charging. I made attempts to clean the charging pins and other troubleshooting techniques to no avail. However I emailed the manufacturer and within 24 hours had a reply that they would be sending me a new pair. After a few weeks, which considering they came from China direct from the manufacturer isn't bad, I had a fresh new pair delivered free of charge.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"If you have no concern for musical quality - buy these.  If you don't mind a short battery life - buy these. If you dont mind having sore ears from heavy pods - buy these.  The case is large and clunky, only charges once (Real air pods can be charged 3x's) These cost $30, if you're buying them for a kid (that you don't like) buy these.",2,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"Great price and very pleased with the quality. It sometimes can take a few min for the two to pair but I’ve found if I put them back in their storage container and take them back out they pair immediately. Overall the quality is great for the price. Glad I tried this brand before paying $200+ for something name brand.

"This is a great set of headphones for exercise.  I sweat a lot.  Like torrents.  These headphones have not been ruined by all the sweating.  Sound quality is good.  They are comfortable.  They stay in my ears when I'm at the gym.  They work for phone calls.  The price is terrific, especially when compared with other ""name brand"" headphones.I have only been using them for a few weeks, so I can't speak to long-term durability, but so far, I love them.",5,1,2019-6-11,1,0,0
"Sound quality on my end is great (unless your head is in water) but my friends can hear background noise very loudly and say it's painfully loud during phone calls.

NO phone calls, NO Zoom meetings, NO swimming laps.... 2 star rating is generous... for my needs...",2,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"I like that there is no cord catching on things. Other reviews who recommended trying various size plugs were absolutely right.

"Headphones are as pictured.  Sound is great, has rich and full sound with decent bass.  Great value.  The case charges the headphones 2-4 times pending your use.  Easy to pair.  Haven't used the calling features yet but seems easy enough with a series of taps on the headset button.  Sometimes one or both headsets can disconnect if you move too far away from the source.  The charging case can be finnicky with the headsets and sometimes you have to spend several attempts to get the headset to register in the charging case accordingly.  Overall a great set of headphones.",4,1,2019-4-20,1,2,0
"If you plan to do anything besides sit in a chair typing these are NOT for you.  Have run these through their paces and they CONSTANTLY fall out of my ears.  I have tried all 4 sizes of included soft attachments and none of them stay in place during even light movement.  Its fine if you're doing weights but during running, jumping, even pushups they constantly slide out and i have had several ear aches from constantly jamming them back into place.  Sound is average, battery life is good, and durability is good (because they fall from my ears regularly and haven't broken yet form hitting the floor).  As soon as i submit this I will be ordering a different set that won't constantly be falling out and these will just be for sitting at the computer.",2,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0

The sound is amazing and I can’t hear none of my surroundings in my home. Which is a good thing. The bass is good too! And my volume is not even all the way up on my phone! I’d give these a 10 stars if possible! Everything came in my package, nothing missing. I wanted the Rosegold ones. But they weren’t in stock. I got the Black, but it’s good too for camouflage.",5,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0

Don't fall out of my ears, quick pairing, last 3 hours+ (I haven't used them to dead battery yet), automatically turn on/off when you place/remove, from case, and magnet holds them in place.Only gripe: cant leave one in the case, you have to pull them both out of the case to connect to your phone.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0

The sounds is incredible and I can’t even hear the person sitting next to me 😂 I have small ears so the fact that they fit is a huge plus.

"The T-10 have a solid sound.  They have accurate midrange response. High end is a touch thin along with the bass response, to be expected with small buds of any brand.They charge very quickly, and maintain a long life on a full charge at average volumes. It is easy to see their charging status even through the closed case.  I do like the convenience of wireless charging, I can drop them on an old wireless charging mat I have and it works great.  When you have just one in, it will beep notifying you that it hasn't paired with its partner bud, but this beeping will eventually stop and you can use just one bud.",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,1
"I used to have another set of Bluetooth headphones that were very good at first, but quickly, the battery life became shorter and shorter, the noise cancellation became worse, and for some reason, the volume began dying down steadily.  Which is why I purchased these and I am so glad that I did.  The battery lasts me about 2/3 of the day through my workday when running non-stop with only one charge and I can charge it up to 100% in about 20 minutes.  The see-through lights are so handy to be able to see when the headphones are charged and whether they are charging or not.  The noise cancellation is world's better and the sound quality is bar-none.  Couldn't be happier with these as I run every day and it wouldn't be the same without some tunes.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
Not quite as blue as I thought they'd be but they sound great and I'm pleased they work so far away! I walked all around my upstairs and it was loud and clear. Also the connection to my phone was about as simple as it could be.I'm still up in the air about how long they stay charged but 🤞🏾 it improves after the first day.,5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,1
"What's not to like:  Attractive, comfortable, paired with phone almost immediately, easy to charge, crisp sound,  effectively blocks outside noise, waterproof, less than a third the price of Airpods with comparable sound.  No, they do not have the longest-lasting usage time before re-charging, but seriously, anyone who wears earbuds more than four hours at a time has other issues.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"Those iPhone earbuds are too strange-looking so I read some of the reviews for the Tozo Earbuds on Amazon and boy was I directed well! These are great. Very easy to charge up, they pair to each other automatically and to your phone in seconds, and they sound great. I would suggest actually carrying them around in the case/charger because I've forgotten they were in my pocket they're so light! Very happy this company chose to offer this product. In fact I left my buds at home on my recent trip so I ordered another pair! I'd rather have a spare than no Tozo at all!",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Received original item and turned out to be defective I sent back and they replaced immediately. I really like the sound quality, length of battery is long which surprised me in a cordless headset, the charger box it comes with is very well made and really protects the headset even in my purse!

"Despite cycling through the different sets of silicone earcaps, I can't find a set that keeps these things in my ears... but that's just a personal problem.  The bigger issue is the voice quality when making phone calls: listeners report hearing a slight hiss that makes it difficult to understand what I'm saying.  That said, the sound quality listening to music is fantastic, and they pair effortlessly with my phone.",3,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"I like these a lot for the proce, the one thing I wish that they had was a way to skip to the next song. So if you want to change songs you'll have to do it on the connected device.

"This replaced a set that I had problems of having it fall out of my ears at the gym. The Tozo fits great as they provide many ear buds. The sound is great, they work when I am far from my mp3 player as well.  I really like the storage unit that has a magnet to ensure the buds are in place and it automatically charges. Also has a USB connector as well. Great price! Love these earbuds!",5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
"I had bought another pair of cheaper wireless earbuds and returned them due to bad microphone connection and the fact that it didn't fit my ear very well. These were the first ones I had looked at and so i decided to give it a try. They work so much better than the other ones I bought! They fit into my ears very well (I have small ears and piercings that sometimes get in the way of other earbuds) and these stay in without me having to worry about them falling out. I had airpods but those did not like to stay in my ear. The quality and noise cancellation is amazing, however the functions for the button on the earbuds do not include skipping songs or volume up or down. Instead it is more focused on phone calls if that's what you're using it for, then it had redial, etc. Overall I am very happy with my purchase!",5,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"I had considered several different brands of Bluetooth wireless headphones, but after comparing prices and reading the reviews I decided to go with the TOZO T10.The first thing I noticed upon opening the package was the elegant design of the product.

The controls are intuitively positioned and easy to master.",5,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0
Ear buds a good. better than the previous ones I was using. For my bike rides these ear bids work well as they do not interfere with the straps on my helmet compared to the ear buds with the stems.

"These do exactly what the description says they will.  They sound as good as in ear buds can sound. To me, better than apple.  The controls are good. the noise cancelling is great as they are ear plugs with sound so you will hear nothing.  I love the charging case and they paired easily in about a minute.  I am not usually a fan of buds because of the way they feel in my ears but I am going to try and get used to them as I do like the sound and convenience.  I have not tried on a phone call yet.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
The sound is pretty good for the price. Not sure why they say it’s got great bass. It’s almost non-existent. The main thing just bugs me about these are the fact that you can’t control the volume or skip tracks. But you can answer calls?! Seems sorta backwards. I’d rather have control of the music than incoming phone calls which makes these pretty much useless at the gym because now I have to take my phone off the arm band to skip tracks or adjust the volume.,2,1,2019-6-20,1,0,0
"I originally bought this as a true wireless earbud system since the wires on my older set kept getting stuck on my neck during workouts. This took care of the problem and more - I was genuinely surprised by the sound these little units produce as I purchased this without any real expectations and mainly bought these for a ""function over form"" item. The best thing I like about these are how long the battery has the potential to last - just bring the case with you and you have 4 full charges of your earset (which last approx 4-6 hours each for me, not bad at all if you ask me) The earbuds also come with a variety of different sizes of earpieces so you can get your best fit in order for the earbud to stay in your ear. They are pretty comfy! I haven't gotten these wet yet, but another part of my purchasing this earset was due to their water resistance. It was the highest (that I found) whilst shopping other similar earset and although I have yet to test that aspect of it, I am fairly confident that it will deliver based on all other aspects being delivered, if not exceeded.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0

"I actually purchased bluetooth earbuds from a different company of a similar price along with these to compare and contrast between the two and see which one I preferred better and these earphones really took the cake for better sound. The bass and overall sound quality was noticeably front and center and more apparent than the other brand I tried (taotronics), which sounded more distorted. I have other products from taotronics and was hoping their earbuds would be good too but compared to tozo's earbuds at least I must say these were much better by a landslide. I've used mine every day since I got them and had no problem figuring out how to connect them so the ease of use is great for when I'm gymming or when listening to music at home and want to dive into bed and chillax. I appreciate that these earphones also seem to have noise cancellation although it may not be advertised? The only issue is that it blocks out too much sound that it's dangerous when I'm on the stairmaster and don't realize how loud I'm panting because I can't hear anything else besides my music! Anyway I was blown away by the sound quality over anything else compared to standard quality of other brands I've tried, and that'll be the main reason I'm choosing these over others of similar price (and airpods are too expensive lol).",5,1,2019-4-11,1,0,0
"I received these ear buds a week ago.  So far, I am very pleased with them.  They came very well packaged.  They were easy to set up and pair with my iPhone.  I really like the charging case they came in.  Good place to store the ear buds when not in use.  The set came with four sizes of ear caps.  They are a little difficult to change but definitely stay in place once put on.  The ear buds take a little getting use to in placing them in your ears but once you learn how it is no problem.  I think the sound quality is very good.  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.",5,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
"The sound is fantastic I wouldn't say they're completely noise canceling which I like. I would give five stars but they kinda hurt my ears, like if I have them in for more than like 5 hours my ears will be a little sore maybe my ears are just to small for them i'm not really sure. I use them all the time though, they are very convenient and sleek. I have told everyone I know to purchase them. Such a great price for a great product.",4,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"Got the earbuds today, the sound quality and noise cancellation are better than expected, as well as the battery life (I used the earbuds for about two hours or so, and they still had a good amount of power left). I had an issue getting the left earbud to stay in my ear, even after I tried all the different sizes of ear cushions they provided (they provide 4 different sizes, very nice!), but I managed to make it fit after I used a cushion from a different set of earbuds. So, not an issue with the actual product, but just my ears. It's very convenient that you can use other ear cushions with these earbuds in case the four sets that come with the product don't work well for you. All in all, a very great product, especially considering its relatively low price when you compare it to Galaxy Buds or Airpods.",5,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0
"Here’s my 4 star story, and hope it doesn’t retract from buying the product. Sound quality is great! I’m a carpenter and finding things to keep the loud saw-sounds out has been difficult. These buds lasted all day for my 10 hour shift, and charged very fast. The charging station also held about 3 charges for the buds before it needed a charge. The reason I gave it four stars is that they are not quite waterproof as they advertise: I left them in the washer accidentally one day. The left one didn’t survive and they cannot be used individually. I would recommend them, however. Absolutely fantastic and worth it for the money.",4,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"This is by far the best product I have ever bought. The sound quality is so accurate and amazing. While I believe this deserves 5 stars, there are some minor flaws. I wish the battery life was longer and sometimes one earbud with randomly stop playing music but continue quickly after. However, there quirks are worth it and dont occur too frequently. I wear these while doing homework, walking around and working out. It truly is wireless and a much more efficient, low priced form of headphones compared to every product I've previously used. I had experienced an issue with my first pair, but was able to easily get a replacement due to amazing customer support on both Worgo's and Amazon's part. I am excited to continue my use with my replacement. I definitely reccomend this as you wont find a product with its quality that's the same price.",5,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0
"These buds are better than many wired ones I've bought before. I was really hoping the bass response would be good, and imo it is. For the price point, I'd say I'm extremely pleased with this product. And many other reviewers also believe as I do, that TOZO cares about their consumers opinions. It's things like that, that will win me over more times than not. I might even buy another pair. Aw work pair and a home pair. I'm also interested in buying the fast charger, it looks like a great deal as well. I would recommend these earbuds.",5,1,2019-9-8,1,0,0
The earbuds seemed to sync well to my phone and tablet. It took a little practice at first but I figured out how to get them to sync. The microphone works well with my phone and I really like how well I can use the earbuds to have a hands free conversation with my phone without a wire getting in the way. The case is great and works with my wireless charger. That is a plus. My main issue with the earbuds is the sound quality. There is no bass and the sound is a bit tinny.UPDATE: TOZO Customer Service reached out to me and offered to replace the earbuds with the new T6 earbuds. Their Customer Service contact was unexpected and I appreciate their commitment to provide quality products to their customers. I gave the product 4 stars because of their Customer Service. I will see how the new earbuds work and provide a new update when I have tested them.,4,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"I've always listened to music my entire life, from cassette players, to cd, and finally apple products starting with the ipod Nano, over the course of all these devices there has been  one consistent issue, Headphone/Earbud Longevity, whether it's from me simply moving about as I listen to music, or perhaps it's from when you put your Headphones/Earbuds away in your pocket, bag, etc, but I've rarely ever have had a pair of either last more than three months or so, then come along bluetooth earbuds and it seemed like my issue was finally resolved, and while yes they did in fact last longer than earbuds and headphones connected to the device they still had the issue of a wire or cable connecting them which again lead to longevity issues, but now with these new earbuds that issue is a thing of the past, I'm allowed to move as freely as I want and I even have a perfect charging station/carry case for my earbuds that completely negates any potential wear and tear damage, so if you're looking for a pair of TRULY wireless earbuds then I highly recommend these, they're EXACTLY what i've been waiting for for YEARS and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase overall.",5,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0

This is the best customer service I have seen in a long time.,5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
The only.negative about these are the ear cushions themselves.  There is a molding nit line in the middle of the silicone. So it scrapes your ear putung then in and removing them......  Ive been using them for about a month now and my ears are so sore... even with the smallest pair supplied....Worst design flaw by far.

"These headphones are absolute trash. Any time they are on and not connected to your device they automatically go into pairing mode. This means that anyone could just hijack your headphones if they wanted to. The sound cuts in and out all the time. Too close to your computer or phone? sound cuts out. Too far ( 10 to 15 feet)? sound cuts out. The sound quality is terrible. Treble only I'm afraid. These headphones sound like they are sawing through your eardrums at even remotely high volumes and handle bass so poorly that the volume continuously goes up and down with every bass sound. These headphone also have a built in fade in to the sound for some reason. Music fades in with each new track and not just quiet to normal volume, but also from right ear to left. I've tried the ""reset"" function a few times. It does nothing. Youtube and Amazon are full of shill reviews. Don't buy this chinese trash.",1,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
Very nice set of wireless earbuds. They are very comfortable and can wear them for hours and the battery life lasts longer than I expected.My only problem with the earbuds is the volume control (or lack there of). The quietest settings on my device is still louder than I would like (would like to be able to hear if someone is talking to me) and whenever I connect the earbuds to my phone after turning them on they are automatically on max volume (felt like I almost blew my eardrums out).,4,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0

Reset them, doesn't solve. Contacted the seller, and they did not even respond. When they work, they're very handy and sound good. Not reliable, however.UPDATE: finally tried them for a workout (usually don't do that). They're even worse for that. Cut out on every single burpee, right next to the phone.

Present for my mom on mother's day. She uses it at work so the noise cancelling is kind of hard to gauge. Quality is decent for wireless and battery life is hard to gauge because she is only using it sparingly and puts them to charge whenever she isn't using them so I dont know how long they will actually last from 100 percent battery life.,5,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"I'm not an audiophile but the sound quality appears excellent.  Nice deep basses.  Pairing is easy.  Packaging was very good.  Problems: 1.  I use it to listen to my TV and there is a significant sound delay though it might be the stereo system or the dongle (Avantree Priva III) I'm using.  2.  Battery life is poor.  Doesn't get 3 hours of active listening.For me, the poor battery life is the most disappointing part of this system and the only reason why, if I had to do over, I would look for another brand.",3,1,2019-6-17,1,0,0
"These were extremely easy to use, immediately out of the box. The pairing instructions were simple, and my phone had no difficulty pairing. I love having their consistent volume and clear sound quality in my ear while doing chores around the house. They cancel out indoor ambient noise very well. They stayed in my ears with no trouble while out on a walk, but I could still hear someone speak directly to me, which seems safer than 100% cancellation.

"I just received my TOZO T10 IPX8 waterproof earbuds today and so far I really love them. I got them to go with my new iPhone SE 2020 that I bought to replace my old iPhone SE. I wanted a good pair that wasn’t going to cost too much. After searching through hundreds of different brands and thousands of reviews I ultimately ended up buying these because of the amount of good reviews, the very reasonable price, and the fact that it came with 4 sizes to choose from. I have small ears and the smallest size are perfect for me and do not fall out. I can’t comment on battery life yet since I just got them but will update my review after a few months of daily use. I would definitely recommend these earbuds!",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,1
"These ear buds are unique in the fact that they come in various colors!  Sound quality has very good upper and mids range sounds but has medium to low bass.  Overall very happy with the purchase, the build quality is very solid and have tested the ear buds in the shower (surprised they worked, lol).",5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,1
"This is my first pair of wireless earbuds. I did a lot of shopping around before settling on this pair. I'm a customer  review reader, and I liked what I read about this product. These earbuds are so easy to pair, and child could do it. Once i learned how to place the buds in my ears, the sound was fantastic. I was amazed with the bass it produces. I'm still learning about all the features that these little beauties hold.The buds fit nice and snug in my ears after I found the correct ear pieces that fit me. The sound is great, and the price is even greater. LOL  Ipods have nothing on these buds, at a price everyone can afford. Makes a great gift for anyone.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"These Bluetooth earbuds are pretty good for the price. I use them when I go workout and they stay in my ear throughout the entire time. These earbuds are great for those that want a premium set without paying the premium price.One thing I would like to point out is that they are great for listening to audio, they don't really excel at making calls. The feedback I've gotten from the few calls I've made so far is that you can hear a lot of background noise. I suppose being at the gym didn't help. But overall I'm very satisfied with the T10s.",5,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"I really like these. Comfortable. Good sound. Noise cancellation, kinda like that of ear plugs. Easy to pair. You can use one at a time and leave the left one in the base, but you do need to set both in the base momentarily before picking both up to work together. If you only pick up the right to use it for a while, then pick up the left, the left won’t sync up with the right. I just set the right one in the base, then pick them both up so they can sync and that’s it. Still easy. Especially for the price. You can walk away from your phone and keep talking. You do have to push and click to answer calls, not just touch it.",5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"Just OK. They work alright with my phone when it's within reach but anything farther than that is a challenge. I paired them with my TV but they kept cutting out & there was no way to fix the slight delay so that was disappointing. They can be finicky to re-pair with devices & the battery life is so-so. But, for a ""cheaper"" pair they do OK.",2,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0

"Wish the battery life was much longer, however, the charging case has several charges in it which makes up for it. They were too tight (too big) for my mom so she passed them on to me and she didn't like not being able to hear herself talk with them in. They may not work for smaller ears even with smaller earpieces. They do stay in well if you get them in to start, great noise canceling.",4,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
"Got these anticipating the arrival of spring and being out doing yardwork, wanting to be active, and not wanting wires in the way while I'm working.  I liked upfront the price, the solid reviews, and the charging case and swappable ear cups.  Now that they're here, I'm really delighted by them.  The sound quality is fantastic, battery life is excellent, charging is easy, and they really remain in place once I put the right ear cups on.  I rated noise cancellation a 3 only because I didn't think these have it as a feature.",5,1,2020-4-30,1,1,0
"I love these earbuds. The sound quality is great and phone calls are clear. I use them for personal use and at work. Battery life is great as well. With me using the navigation and music constantly, I can get about 8 hours per fully charged bud. I got a second pair for my coworker because of how great it is for work as well. And it fits my ear perfectly with the smallest plug. I sweat and move alot at work and it has never fallen out. Very happy with these and the wireless charging feature is a plus.",5,1,2019-9-15,1,0,1
The set I have suck horribly keeps losing connection. I have to keep my phone in my hand in order to keep a connection. I wouldn't recommend these.

"Couldnt picture them being better! Great value for the price. Highs are clear as day. Not a real big bass guy so this gives off a nice amount for me to be more than satisfied.

I seem to always need to turn my earbuds up to max and then they still aren't loud enough for me when I'm at the gym. These aren't too bulky looking either. I was afraid they'd stick out too much, but they don't. They stay put very well! Tried to shake them loose with my head and they stayed put. Very happy with them!",5,1,2020-6-5,1,0,1
"Purchased for $40 and so far it's a great product (I've only owned them a few weeks).  Sound is excellent and multiple sizes of ear bud adapters allow for a perfect fit.  I have purchased many wireless earbuds in the past and these by far are the best I have owned at this price point.  The charging case is well made and the earbuds power on and connects automatically when you take them out of the case.  Also easy to use only one if you need an ear free.  I have worn them walking, running, cycling, mowing the lawn, and working at my desk.  They stay in place and offer great sound.  We'll see how long this great experience lasts but for now I am very pleased with my purchase.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0

I have to write a lot of papers for school, and voice dictation helps cut down the time papers get finished by a lot.After making this purchase, I noticed that voice dictation did not work, or there is no feature. This was disappointing, however the quality of the headphones make up for the lack of voice dictation.",4,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
I bought these with the intention of using them for running and working out.  They sync fast and appeared to be a strong set of head phones.  However every time I used them they would fall out of my ears.  The box contains only one set of ear buds.  The main reason for falling out is due to the weight.  They are heavy and stick out of ear a lot.  Therefore they fall off when running.  My right ear phone fell off and I ran over it with my foot.  I wont buy another pair of these.,2,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"These earbuds are absolutely fantastic for the price! The audio quality is great and has some surprisingly good bass. The batteries in the earbuds work for hours before they need to be charged, and the charging/holding case can charge the earbuds multiple times before the case itself needs to be charged. They fit snugly into my ear and don't feel like they're going to fall out when I move my head around. The Bluetooth range is also fantastic! I have no trouble staying connected to my phone if I leave it in a different room on the other side of my apartment. The build quality is solid to the point that they're also quite waterproof.All around I would very genuinely say that these are the best wireless earbuds in this price range. I have recommended these to so many people.",5,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"Had these for almost a week now and have listened to both a book and music and each time I have had moments where one or both of the ear buds goes out.

Owned for 2 months.  Great sound.  Simple instructions.  Easy to use.  Last week the blue LED lights on the charging case stopped working but Tozo Customer Service responded to my email about the problem the next day with 3 easy steps I could take to try to fix.  Those steps didn't work so Tozo promised to send me a new charging case for free.  I'm happy!,4,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"The sound was very good in these ear buds and I was happy with them in that sense, but forget these if you have smaller ear canals. They hurt after 20 minutes of wear and they stuck out really far! The charging case was convenient, but I had to return them because they made my ears insanely sore and did not look good sticking out (I tried rotating them and using different ear bud covers with no luck). Battery life was good for when I did use them.",4,1,2019-6-20,1,0,0
"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Disclaimer: To activate the 18 month warranty I was asked to write a review.I have only worn them once for about 30 minutes so far, but they sound pretty good. I actually cant hear anything people are saying while wearing them. I find that for some reason by music kept changing tho? which is odd and requires further investigation. Could just be my phone though, so who knows. Anyways for 30 something bucks and a potential warranty, I think it's a pretty reasonable deal.",4,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0

You CAN pause, play, skip, reverse, volume control up and down and pick up calls!!!!! I have done it all and am very pleased that I can.I got the Khaki color and it's like a mix between rose gold and flesh color, and blends well with the skin. I like them. Happy customer.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,1,0
These are pretty bad. The sound quality sounds horrible. But they are almost unusable. The case is huge and does not fit in pockets making it really hard to carry around. They come with adjustable ear pieces but the smallest one is way too big for my ears. The size makes them extremely uncomfortable and also makes it so they fall out of my ears constantly. I know they are cheap but they aren’t worth the money.,1,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
I was really surprised by how well these work. My mom has the galaxy buds that were $150+ and these work just as good as hers. She is actually a little jealous because she spent so much on hers and mine work just as well. It comes with different size ear bud adapters and a convenient necklace that I like to use when carrying the case if I have nothing else with me. I would definitely recommend over the more expensive brands.,5,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
"I've tried lots and lots of headphones and I've never really found any that fit well in my ears as well as cancel noise. Literally the only downside to this product is that if people are trying to talk to you, you will not hear them. They last about 4 hours of listening to music, but if you want to listen continuously, just use one of the pair and have the other charging. Then switch them when the one you're wearing dies. The ""low battery please charge"" reminder will play approx. every ten seconds so you might as well start charging them when you first hear it.Overall, I'm very pleased. For 40 bucks, it can't be beat. Plus, they're way more comfortable than AirPods.",5,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
The earbuds of the year 2019 should no longer have the blink blue light while using. I need no light as I use them at night next to my baby that sleeps early. The blinking made my baby to keep both eyes on them.The sound quality are just the same as those found at TJ Max.,1,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0

"I was really excited to get these wireless earbuds. They are big, clunky and heavy. The sound is VERY tinny, there is little to no bass at all. I wore them to walk in the neighborhood. I was walking quickly and they kept falling out of my ears. They don't fit the way you would think, either, which ends up making them top-heavy, which then is the main reason they keep falling out. Will be returning them ASAP.",1,1,2020-9-28,1,0,0

Can't beat it for the price I recommend them for anyone that's looking for some good headphones that sound great and not trying to break there wallet. You will not regret this purchase.

"I love the sound and quality of these... So much that I ordered 2 more pair as gifts. There is one fatal flaw though. Despite trying every combo of the ear buds, they fall out during exercise. My son has the same problem and so does the friend I bought them for. If you run or power walk, they unfortunately fall out of your ears. Deal breaker on me recommending them.",2,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
"I use these regularly for listening to music and videos will at work, through the house. The sound is great, and they fit well - as long as you change the earpieces for your ear size. They also hold a charge for about 3 hours, and recharge very quickly (within 30 minutes). The other thing I really like is the case is the charger - and you can charge it wireless. I have a wireless charger for my Samsung phone and set this on the charger to ensure I have fully charged base every time.I was skeptical, but very pleased with the purchase. I have had other wireless earphones that I was not so impressed with. This purchase was well worth the money!",5,1,2019-5-4,1,1,0
"The sound quality is probably the best thing about these headphones in that they sound just ok. Otherwise, I have have problems with them falling out constantly despite trying every combination of replaceable eartips they come with. I think they're just too heavy to not have any support. Clicking the button requires you to push it into your ear, or hold it awkwardly to push it. The battery life isn't great, I feel like I get maybe 4 hours out of them. They lose connection pretty often, especially when using both at the same time, I usually only use a single one because of this. The case is just too big to be pocketable, when you do pocket it, it's too clunky to be comfortable. I wanted to like these, but now I'm shopping for some replacements.",2,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"For the price, these are really good.  Here's the trick to pairing and re-pairing them with multiple devices- DO NOT TURN THEM OFF!  It takes forever to re-pair with another device, even if you've already set them up- hey, you get what you pay for.  Once I discovered that trick I was much happier with them.  The right one is the ""main"" connection.  Just keep your case charged and you should be set- otherwise that battery life isn't the greatest.  They come with 3 different earpiece sizes.

Wow is all I can say! I have had TWS earbuds before and really liked the convenience of the wireless experience but found that there was a tradeoff in the sound quality. Not so with these Tozos. Base and treble are right up there with high quality headphones. The sound stage is good as well. I believe that these earners will not only be great for calls but also very good with music as well.

"I have to admit these are really good for comfort & sound quality. The way I judge sound quality is if they sound great without using any EQ on my phone. These pass that test, and work well.The only things that I don't like are the fact that on the outside it has a ""R"" and ""L"" which I think looks kind of stupid.

So I bit the bullet and ordered them from Amazon and right out of the box they paired quickly and bluetoothed with my Ipad, Iphone and my flat screen TV.Perfect and affordable.",5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,1
"Easy to use and sound quality was amazing. A little tricky trying to change the size of the earbuds as you just pull them off but getting the new one back on takes few tries to get them on. My first pair of wireless earbuds and I'm happy so far. The biggest issue is when you are on the phone, the other person hears you far away. It didn't matter who it was or where I was, but the moment I put one of the earbuds close to my mouth to speak, they were able to hear me better. If you are just using it for music, then it's a great product. If you need it for phone calls, I would stick to something where the mic is closer to your mouth.",4,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"These earbuds have great sound, would be nicer if they were a little louder. Bass and clarity is good. The problem I have, like several other reviews, the connection is choppy. While mowing my lawn I keep my phone in my pocket, and every time I turn my head it causes these to cut out. It's not just a sporadic thing, it's Every single time. Also if I leave my phone on a counter and walk 10-15 feet away, the cut out or disconnect. I've reset them, as suggested in other reviews, and still choppy. I wanted to like these because the sound quality and stability are GREAT! Just wish they didn't cut out with every head movement. Needless to say, I am sending these back.",2,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
"These actually sound really good and they paired good and stayed connected. Can’t say the same about another brand I bought, which is no longer available (fosho) or something which sounded horrible nw would not stay connected and the one that did at times had static reception. Anyway, these seem nice, and great for the price, however let’s see how long I can get them to last.",5,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"So, I got these because one, I was tired of my wired ear buds catching onto doors, or being a certain length, basically all the jazz that is associated with them.And 2: I had been wanting to get a set of blue tooth earbuds for awhile.",5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"I would love to write a review on this product, but the item arrived with everything except the earbuds. It seems like a great product and I’m waiting for my replacement item. It’s a shame because this was a Fathers’ Day gift that I presented to my husband today for early usage, only for him to be the one to discover the missing component.",1,1,2020-6-18,1,1,1
"I absolutely love these!  I had tried two other kinds in the past.  One set was sent to me broken (twice).  The other set, the battery didnt last.  This pair is awesome though I can go to the gym all week and not have to worry about charging the battery pack.  I like they they come with three sizes of the ear bud silicone pieces, so I was able to change the size so it would fit in my ear.  The sound quality is awesome and the connection from my phone to the ear buds doesnt skip or get interrupted. I have tested the distance they reach from my device, but I usually have my phone on me at the gym anyway.  I am so happy with my purchase.  Plus they come with a warrenty!",5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
"The TOZO T10 is a great bargain when it comes to earbuds. I own two and use them for workouts, showers, and many other things. The sound quality on them is comparable to many of the more expensive options on the market, including my Samsung Buds. The bass is also very impressive. The battery seems to last quite long as well, even when using the earbuds at the highest volume. Additionally, the case holds multiple charges, which is always a plus.  My only issue is with QC, as the earbuds ceased to work properly after a couple of months. However, the customer service provided from TOZO was first class. They solved these issues quickly.To sum it up, volume, bass, and battery outperform many of the other options on the market. At this price point and with excellent customer service, I would highly recommend the TOZO 10.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"These are the best ear buds I've ever owned ! Sound quality is far superior to Beats buds. Working distance is approximately 34-40 meters, loud with deep punchy bass, a solid 5-6 hours of play time and almost 3 days of standby time !",5,1,2020-1-16,1,1,0
I've owned these for about 3 weeks and have been using then almost daily. The fitting fits quiet nicely and I have had no issues with it falling out (except when I accidentally touch/hit it. They are the perfect weight and is not too heavy not overly light.I was genuinely surprised by the great sound quality especially for a fully wireless earphone. Volume can get pretty loud so do not worry about it being too quiet.,5,1,2019-2-13,1,0,0

"Awesome headphones. I just got these, but they seem to be everything as advertised. The power button is a click button, I feel is way better than the touch ones I have.. Easy to use and sound quality is AMAZING and has a decent range on them. I was able to leave my phone in the house and walk outside  and the music didn't even scramble. So far good!",4,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"I bought these in September 2019. I am reviewing them in June 2020 because I prefer to see how a product works long term.  I have been impressed with these since I bought them. They sound good, they're comfortable, and the price is good for the quality. Lately, however, the left earbud disconnects after a few minutes of use, and doesn't reconnect unless I put the buds in the charger and start over.  I saw some other reviews mentioning connection issues so I guess I'm not surprised. Bottom line, they were great while they lasted but I was hoping for a little more useful life.",3,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"These were my first pair of bluetooth earbuds and as an iPhone user I wish I hadn't waited so long... no more lost or broken headphone adapters!The audio quality is impressive and gives you plenty of bass. Great if you're running or lifting and want to really feel the music and ignore the outside world. If you're not a basshead, the sound might be a bit unbalanced with regards to the mids/highs so don't be afraid to adjust your EQ settings. Given the price, convenience, and build quality I am completely satisfied with the sound. If you're looking for incredibly detailed and nuanced audiophile quality, these are not it... but that's not what they're supposed to be. These are an everyday carry item that perform well in almost any environment.",5,1,2019-9-24,1,0,0
After about a month and half the right quit pairing and talks really long and slow when powering on and off.  Thought it might be the battery but charges co workers ( same set different color) just fine.  I have emailed TOZO twice for assistance after trying the reset option and still have not gotten an answer from them.  As it has been just over the month mark i am only entitled to a partial refund from Amazon.  I loved these things and They were great while they worked.  The fact that i found an affordable set that i could use each earbud independently was super awesome too.EDIT>>>> Tozo customer service replied back and is sending a replacment so that i will have a working set.,5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"I was initially very pleased with this product with the ease of use and sound quality. However, as with most things you get what you pay for.  I've used this product daily for about 30 days and now the case will not charge and will not charge the earbuds any longer.  I've tried different cords, different outlets, wireless charging and wired charging.  I cannot recommend this item due to it only lasting over 30 days.  Others may be luckier than I but I'm out $40.",1,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"I really loved these Tozo headphones. I wanted to wait a couple of weeks before I wrote a review. Before I bash these, I will say that the sound quality and looks are great. The issue that I have is that the headphones are beginning to cut in and out when I go for a walk. I have not noticed this defect when I’m in my house, only when I go outside and walk. I busted my butt to find these headphones and read hundreds of reviews, enough that my wife was so over me talking about it. I finally decided on these. So when I finally got them, I wasn’t  disappointed until this little glitch began to happen. I did register for the warranty, but it really doesn’t have directions to redeem it. I guess I’ll have to do some research.",2,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
The ear buds always fall out of my ear. Always. I’m always chasing them down stairs or in parks. Only one side works at a time. I have iPhone XR. It connects each ear bud but only one works at a time. They are easy to charge and sound quality and noise level is excellent. I just wish they didn’t fall out of my ears. I’ll probably trade these in for ones that don’t fall out.,3,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0

"It's a good quality product but even with the smallest ear buds it doesn't fit into my ears and sticks out. They are extremely bulky and heavy, and fall off frequently. You need to have elephant's ears to be able to use them. It feels like you are inserting pine cones into your ears. After trying for a week I gave up and decided to send them back.",3,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"Bought these for my wife for Christmas last year, I tend to use Bose Over Ear noise cancellation but due to recent change in active lifestyle (cycling) i didn't want to spend the $$$$$$ on new Bose Wireless and since I knew she loved hers I decided to give these a whirl.  I, like my wife, are extremely happy with this purchase!  They sound great, SUPER user friendly, and since we both have wireless charging pads we love that additional feature for the base.  If you think they look bulky, they're really not (she has small ears) and they're EXTREMELY lightweight for the quality.  Really great item for the pricing.  Would recommend to anyone and buy again in a heartbeat.",5,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"Battery life is no where near where they claim it is.  Also it behaves very goofy.  It will just loose connection with your phone after a few moments of silence and the only way to get it back is to power cycle them, the volume is low even though my phone was turned up all of the way.  They're just not well designed.  In returning them.",1,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
UPDATEAfter owning these for almost a year they have went down hill.  The left cuts out all the time.  Right seems ok most of the time.  When the right cuts out then both do.  But mainly the left cuts out.,1,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"Good fitment, pairs quickly, and decent sound quality. HOWEVER if you're using them in a loud/semi loud environment, you can hardly hear them at full volume. I've tried using them while cutting the grass and running a saw, and all you can make out is a slight mumble of what you're listening to. Thinking it was my phone, I plugged in my corded headphones with the volume at max and it nearly made my ears bleed it was so loud. I might keep these as a back up or just to workout in, but for what I need headphones for most of all, is going to require me to buy another set from someone else unfortunately.",3,1,2019-4-5,1,0,0
These earbuds have worked so well for our family we have bought three pair total. Small enough to not standout like I'm trying to show off my wireless earbuds. No white tail like a animal in my ear. Sound quality is great. I use them for music and audio books at work running loud equipment. We did have one pair that a single earbud quit working shortly after it arrived. No problem! Custom service was great. Gave us a few trouble shooting ideas. Those didn't work so new set shipped to us. That easy!,5,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0
"It stopped charging the day after the warranty expired. The left side became very hot when plugged in and there was a strong burning plastic smell It was amazing while it lasted (excellent sound quality and battery life), but it should work more than 31 days. I’m worried if I had left it changing and I wasn’t home, it would have caught my house on fire!",1,1,2020-6-20,1,1,0
"They don't automatically disconnect when charging in the case (how maddening!!) and occasionally would pair with my phone without me knowing. Probably because of this, battery life seems considerably shorter than another brand of earbuds I had (lost those and thought I'd see if I liked these better). I was excited for the low profile earbuds style and water resistance but the fact that it can't even get basic features working means I definitely won't be reordering these when I inevitably lose them.",2,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0
"Really nice product, and it’s inexpensive. The sound and bass quality is amazing, can’t ask for much more. Pairing is easy, the right earbud controls both and the left can be turned off or used individually and each will pair as u pull them out of the charge box. Charge box quality is great to. Also they stay in my ears real good, just put in the right rubber ear piece. Enjoy",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"These come with a few different earbud pieces so you can get just the right fit.  The case has a magnetic lid to keep it closed, and there is a little rim that insets into the base to keep it closed snug and keep dust out.  Earbuds snap into the base magnetically so there's no issue lining up the parts for a proper charge. To my surprise, there is even a little card in the package suggesting to register for the 1 yr warranty, didn't know the warranty was part of the deal.  They are ""waterproof"", and instructions say you can't dive underwater because of blue tooth signal limitations.  5 stars so far, though I'm still charging them up for my first jog with them.",5,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0
I really liked the charging casing the earbuds came with. The sound quality was solid for music and for listening to podcasts however it seemed to diminish only while on a call. Recipients could not hear me as well as I could ear them over the earbuds. The volume would decrease on its own while on a call. The battery life was unreal! They did last for around 4-5hrs without a charge. I used the earbuds interchangeably bc I only use one while riding my bike which allows me to switch to the opposite earbud when the current one begins to loose charge.,4,1,2020-3-3,1,1,0
It definitely gets the job done. But I am not pleased with the following details:- range: you have to stay close to your phone to hear the music and have little to no obstruction in the way.,3,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"These are a solid pair of wireless earbuds, especially for the price. The sound quality is very high for phone calls. For listening to music, the quality is still pretty high, but the range of sound is a bit limited. The battery life is long-lasting. I have kept my earbuds in the case when not using them, so I have not actually let them run out yet. The case will charge them for 2-3 days without needing to be recharged itself. My only issue with these earbuds is the difficulty with getting the second earbud to connect when I start with only one earbud and then decide to use both. In this situation, it is necessary to reset both earbuds and then restart with both on at the same time. But as far as starting with both on, the connection process is smooth. Overall, a solid pair of earbuds.",4,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"The fast charge, wireless charging case, and sound quality mean I stay sane during tiring office hours. the only thing I'd change is give them more battery life., but a quick smoke break is normally enough to bring them up to around 80%.That and the ability to change the function of the buttons, double press for re-dial on a pair of headphones seems useless. But almost all headphones do that (to my and many other's annoyance).",4,1,2019-7-1,1,0,0
"The Bluetooth freedom and perfect fit make this next sound listening option a must. But you do have to pay attention to the fit of each bud as head movement can cause them to become loose. The sound quality for music is acceptable with lots of ambient noise but much better in quiet settings. Phone conversations are even better than the best car sound system! Battery life is the only drawback but for $45, its viable compromise when compared to like Samsung buds that advertise for $119 at Costco and 20 hour battery life. Overall, great value and ease of use for the price.",5,1,2019-5-13,1,0,0
"This is the worst product I have ever bought on Amazon.The first is that the packaging of the product is damaged, the true quality of the product is not consistent with the introduction, the sound is very harsh,and the most important thing is that the store' s service attitude is very poor,which makes I am very angry.",1,1,2020-6-6,1,1,0
"For the $ the sound quality is very good. I get these wet all the time and they do just fine. The software is simple. Bluetooth connection with my android phone is seamless. Put them in ears and go. The mic is not good for phone calls. Most people tell me I sound far away. If you're on a bluetooth headset for work all day, this will not be a suitable replacement. I wish I could find some earbuds just like this with a great mic",4,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"All in all they are ok headphones, I'm not sure about the set that I got however because the smelled like cigarette smoke right out of the box and I was missing a few of the earcaps and they would not pair To each other as much as I followed the instructions.

"Holy moly, do these wireless earbuds sound amazing!  I was skeptical about the price and brand but I figured 80K+ plus people can't be wrong right?  Everyone was right! These have to be the best earbuds out there.  I've listened to the Apple earbuds and those don't hold a candle to the sound quality these give.  People don't NEED a 300 dollar pair of Apple airbuds, they WANT them.  I will say this though, you NEED these airbuds.  You can't beat the price and quality.  I highly recommend!",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0

I used the Tozo earbuds for a few months with my iPhone X. It was great & awesome but then all of the sudden the left earbud stopped pairing with the right. The sound will only come out to one earbud at a time...NOT at the same time. I tried resetting per manufacturer's instruction but no success. This product was great in the beginning but now it's garbage. I would not recommend to buy. Better to invest in AirPods. At least I know it will work with my iPhone unlike this Tozo piece-of-crap earbuds!,2,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
"I have small ears and these worked perfectly for them. They come with three sized ear bud tips. They also are great for blocking out noise. I wear these at the gym and they stay in place. I use these for PC and phone and they work great. Sound quality is crisp and all music types sound good. I just wished they came with a carrying pouch because if you put them in the case they turn on and drain the battery, otherwise they are fantastic!",5,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0
"These earbuds are garbage. The biggest issue is the connectivity consistently cuts out on the left earbud and often enough on the right as well. (phone pairs to right bud, then right pairs to left) If I have my phone in my pocket the sound cuts out, when I have it in my workout sleeve it cuts out, when I breathe it cuts out. I have my phone on my desk with these in as I type this and it's cutting out for no reason.I didn't expect much noise cancellation given the price but I can hear someones conversation as clear as if I was just playing music next to me.  Avoid these at all costs. Just do yourself a favor and spend the extra cash on a decent pair.",2,1,2019-6-25,1,1,0
They feel good in the ears and pick up a clear sound.  Also I like the built in charging case and they stay charged up while in the case.  I just got them and tried them out and they worked great with picking up the sound from my Galaxy Tab 2 and my Motorola G5+ cell phone.  This is my very first pair of wireless ear buds and I am very impressed with the sound and function.,5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
These earbuds are really great and long lasting considering the price. I ordered mine in February of this year and I’ve been pretty satisfied with them. I had a bit of trouble keeping them in my ear when I do strength training at the gym until after I looked at the manual and put them in the way it’s described. If I tried to run with them they seem like they would fall out regardless. The only problems I have with them is the bass and that there’s no support for Siri (yes I have an IPhone). The bass seems to get lower whenever an artist starts with their lyrics. I’ve used other headphones to compare and these seem to be the only ones that do it. It could be something to do with the songs themselves but I’ve only really noticed it with these. I use Siri kinda often and my older headphones just needed to be pressed for a couple seconds to activate it. These only call the last number that called you if you press and hold the button for a couple seconds. Overall still a really great product.,4,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0

My husband and I both purchased a pair to try for working out. Out of the box they paired very nicely without any issue.  (Bonus.....They don't conflict with each other when both sets are on) The fit is snug inside the ear WITHOUT adding extra pressure and making them uncomfortable to wear. The noise cancellation was quite an added surprise. It blocks more than enough so that listening to your music or whatever is enjoyable.  They do have GREAT sound quality. nThe bass was perfect. Sweating in them is not an issue. Overall we are very pleased with our purchase and would recommend these ear buds. to others.,5,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"Don't believe the ""deep bass."" They're okay for podcasts, but not so much for music. People on the phone say I sound tinny and far away. And when I went running with them, the connection skipped like they were 100 feet away from my phone (which was on me in my waist pack). I guess I'll keep them around in case they're useful for some reason at some point.",2,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
"These ear buds are fairly comfy, easy to wear, and sound quality is fine. Will they last longer than 6 months? The last two pairs didn’t last 6 months.

I’ve gone through many a wireless earbuds and these have got to be my favorite.  They were easy to pair with my phone. Really “plug and play.” Sound quality is excellent and blocks out just the right amount of sound. And the 3 different size silicone buds are perfect.

I bought my first pair several months ago after having gone thru a few pairs of earbuds from other manufacturers. Fell in love with them so much i bought a pair for my wife.Here's what i like:,5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"If I could rate this product with 6 stars I would. I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. Extremely well packaged, the build quality is first rate, a lot of bang for your buck. Connectivity was instantons and super simple and sound quality was excellent. Another great feature was ability to charge unit with charging pad (no cable needed) I have had a set of Apple air buds previously which I paid big bucks and was extremely disappointed, they were very uncomfortable and kept falling out of my ears. I wound reselling at a loss. Highly recommend!!!",5,1,2019-11-25,1,1,0
"Love love love these!  I'm a little afraid to wear them in the pool because I must have smaller ears than most people.  I'm afraid they'll fall out. I wear them to bed and I'll be wearing them to clean so it's not such a chore.  I bought the tovo charger as well and the charger, case and earbuds charge beautifully.  👍👍",5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"They seem to work well so far. Honestly can’t speak for battery life yet but will update after using for a while. Good sound quality. They stay in my ears well and I was worried about that because I have small ears and when I’m running, earbuds normally fall out. I like the charging case as well, seems like good quality.",5,1,2020-10-4,1,0,0
"Bought these to replace a set of Airpods that died on me after a year.  I figured if a pair of 170$ Airpods are only going to last a year, I'd prefer to pay a lot less, so went with these.  Solid build, and while the fit isn't perfect, I'm able to use these for running without too much of a struggle.  Occasionally they will start to loosen while I run, but a quick push will get them back into place.  Very happy with the purchase, especially the price.",5,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0
"Was skeptical at first but the reviews were good and the price was right so we gave these Bluetooth earbuds a chance.  We bought one pair to try and they were so awesome my husband was like “I want a pair too!” So we got a set each and we love them.  I take mine with me everywhere.  They’re great in the car when I need to make a call, or at the gym and theses little things can really bump up the music! Noise canceling feature on these is not exaggerated.  Definitely want to get a wireless charging pad for them if you can because it’s easier to charge, because you just lay the charging case on it and go (and it holds a charge for hours and days if not in constant use) and the wireless charger pad is cool for your phone too so it’s nice to have.  So if you’re on the fence and looking for some new Bluetooth earphones, these are it.  I promise you won’t be disappointed.",5,1,2019-8-19,1,0,1
"Had apple air pod that cost almost$200. Stopped working after 1 year of 1x a week use. Didn't want to spend that much again and got these.

Great purchase at great price.would recommend.",5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"I specifically purchased these to be able to do my lap swim. I did not realize or was aware that it only goes 10 meters far from the phone. With that being said a pool is 25 meters and it kept constantly cutting off. I wish the description would state it was only for 10 meters other than that I can’t complain. They really do work great. I use them for the gym, but for what I originally purchased it for did not work. If you plan on having your phone on you all the time while using these headphones then I say go for it .",3,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"I like that this product has an easy full wireless setup, that it is IP68, wireless rechargable and discreet. The only slight annoyance is when I have both buds in and either wearing a paper mask or something on my face, the sound would cut out from the secondary earpiece, also no sound from either headset when device is in either back pocket or pocket opposite of primary earpiece or when device is facedown with a book above it. Just a weird quirk but definitely a great buy.",4,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"My son was about to purchase AirPod Pros, but I told him to wait until I bought this pair. We are both so happy he waited. Definitely got good bass. Definitely cancels noise. Why pay so much more?

I like the fit and the pairing was easy. Not sure about how long the battery will last, only had them turned on for about 30 minutes. So Far So Good.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"I liked these except for two major things, and that is when I was using them the bluetooth would keep cutting out which was annoying. The other thing was that when I would get text messages it would cut the sound which was really annoying as well. I returned them and repurchased the Omoron which I really liked the first time and work great.",2,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
The Tozo T10 wireless earbuds work great. I had to charge them when I received them. But that was just fine. They synced up just fine with my phone. I like to listen to music when I'm on my elliptical and my wired headphones kept getting in the way. The Tozo stay put in my ears and are not heavy in weight. I was able to zone out my dogs and my children.,5,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0
"Just got these ear buds and was surprised by the quality.  The manufacturer's box was organized with care; the sound quality is really good (after repeated comparisons to Apekx sports, couldn't tell a difference); everything's simple, efficient and tasteful (the charge box has a magnetic pull on the ear buds and the L and R are easy to read).But after so much care, there is one major design flaw:  the buds continue to flash when used.  Didn't notice in daylight, but like to watch with the lights off at night.  It's like two lightning bugs blinking greetings to one another, without stopping.  Will definitely keep them, just can't use them at night, so deducted 2 stars (will not give anything a perfect rating).",2,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"Was extremely hesitant on buying these earbuds but after using them for three days so far and it is a good purchase for the price. I bought other earbuds before (Beats Powerbeats and Bose SoundTouch). While they are great sounding headphones, they are not meant for long term use. Neither were waterproof (low waterproof rating) and with most earbuds (Powerbeats in particular) they started giving a less pronounced sound from everyday use (and that is the case with most wireless and wired headphones). I tested them in the shower and walked through a thunderstorm, they were still working at optimum use. Bottom line, if you want an earbud for everyday use, you can not go wrong with TOZO T10. You want a good earbuds for everyday use and for a low price, I definitely recommend TOZO T10.",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0

"These lasted about two months...good quality while they worked. The sound quality became poor and one of them stopped working. I pulled the product up on my Amazon order, which said to contact the manufacturer/shipper. They said to contact Amazon. When I contacted Amazon, the company reached out to me. I received some instructions to try and reset it, but the writing contained very poor grammar/English. I tried what the suggested as I understood it and they still did not work. I sent another email to the company, and they said they will send a replacement...I am currently waiting for the replacement to arrive.",1,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"The sound quality is not that of earbuds that cost hundreds, but it is more than adequate for the price and in line with my expectations and intended use.  I use these earbuds for running and have no issues with them staying in place.  I did have an issue with the wireless charging case (only one side would charge).  After contacting the seller to explain the product issue, I was promptly provided a full replacement which arrived within days, which was much appreciated.  The product performance is adequate, the features are basic but quite good (wireless charging case), and the product support was very good when an issue presented.  All considered, for the price I consider this to be a great value and am glad I purchased.",5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"i ordered these after my spouse lost their $200 earbuds at the laundromat. I was hesitant because even those expensive ones would cut out or drop off often. After reading reviews and looking it over, I decided to try these out.I have only had them for a couple days so I haven’t been able to really try out the battery or anything. However, I love the way they look and the sound really is nice. I plan to use them for the gym and the transportation to/from work.",5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"I have always purchased inexpensive headphones with a wire or that awkward laying on your neck ""wireless"" wire. This was the first time I really wanted wireless buds. I was definitely not expecting these earbuds to have such a high quality. They arrived quickly during the pandemic. They came with charge already so I could excitedly try them out. I was unaware that the case is charged and carried multiple full charges and could charge wirelessly itself. The small size soft buds that came with the package were perfect. I have small ears and usually can't handle wearing most headphones for too long. I was able to go jogging with no trouble. Hopefully I can update my review after a few months of use. I feel spoiled even for how inexpensive these were !!",5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"The sound quality is very good EXCEPT that it tends to cut out for no apparent reason.  My phone is sitting right next to me, I'm not moving around, but still the sound will occasionally cut out for a second or two.  Very annoying.

"The product is as advertised. Very well balanced bass. Noise cancellation. Loud. Comfortable. The box that the product arrives in comes complete with pairing instructions upon opening, a manual, earbuds for variable sizes, a charging cord, and a lanyard for portability.Update: So after using it for a while, a few things are apparent to me after using this item for an extended period of time. Bravo to the people who designed the housing for the battery. This battery charges fast. On the offhand, the volume limit is kind of disappointing.",3,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
The tone is good and the sound is crisp and clear. The bass is very good but fit and bass were improved when I switched to the smaller ear buds. TOZO adds an interesting feature in that when you take the right earpiece out of the case it immediately powers up. Take the left earpiece out and it syncs to the right earpiece. Pairing with my phone was no problem. I am not a runner but I had no issues with the fit or the earpieces staying in place during brisk walks and riding my bicycle.,4,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0
"Very nice Bluetooth earbuds and very easy to setup. I didn’t even read the manual. I linked it with my phone in 10seconds. Yes. Not kidding. Actually it’s less than 10 seconds. For the sound. Its exactly my taste. Crystal clear at high. Good enough bass at low. Voices is clear on phone call. Even on the noisy street background. I usually charge it twice a week. The charge cover is hard to open. I believe they designed it this way because of IP8 rating. Anyway I don’t need to open it since its Qi wireless charging. Yes. Its wireless charging. I mean for this price. With this good quality. I say this is perfect, no complain at all.",5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,1
Buds arrived late and I almost returned since I specifically purchased for my international travel schedule. I decided to try and immediately loved these. The souls is crisp and clear. I virtually hear no noise. These are perfect and very easy to operate. I use while working out. I get lost in whatever I am listening to which makes working out less painful! (It’s bee a while!) I definitely recommend this product!!,5,1,2019-9-14,1,0,0
When I first used this items I noticed some problems w the charging case and or buds.  I contact the customer support/ manufacturer and they quickly made things right by sending me a replacement.  I was unable to write a fair review of these buds because they were defective.  Now that I recieved the new buds the case charges really quickly and it also charges the buds quickly as well.  Sounds quality is amazing for such small buds. The bass quality is surprising as well.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I am glad I got an exchange instead of a refund.,5,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0
"I have been looking for some wireless earbuds but wasn’t going to commit to expensive AirPods, so I decided to look for some good quality earbuds at a reasonable price and these are it.

"I have several earbuds that was crappy, and no one was able to hear me. I did some searching and came across these TOZO T10.  Watched multiple reviews and they are amazing.  The charge life works for me. I can use them with my office phone and my personal. They do not slip out your ears. Comfortable. I have just turned 3 people on to them and they will be placing orders ASAP.Called my mom while using them and I was like mom how do I sound. She said thank god you got you some earbuds that work and do not sound a mess anymore on the phone.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,1
I actually hated to give these a bad review bc they worked great for about 3 months. Then one day it just stopped charging out of no where. I've seen other reviews with the same issue....I can't return them bc i'm past my return date. What a total bummer....Only other thing I will say about these is if you have small ear holes they wont stay in...Luckily I was able to switch the ear piece out with another set I had.,2,1,2020-9-29,1,0,0
"I like these, but they were hard to sync at first. Just takes a bit of patience, I would not wear them swimming, they say waterproof,  But that is not the problem. The problem is they fit loose in the ear they would fall out easily. I do light workouts on treadmills and do weights and they do fine but if you are doing somersaults flipping around for anything super extraneous out get something with more secure holdings",4,1,2019-8-27,1,0,0
Took a while to get the right silicon size to fit my ears (any earpiece would always fall out in my big ears) but once I found the right size these are great. The only issue is that the battery life is very low. Will not last a full work shift even if I use one at a time and charge the other one. But the sound is on par with any of the higher end stuff. And charging is a breeze with the case.,5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"Good sound quality, plenty of bass. Headphones will sound better of course, and home stereo speakers will sound light years better than headphones.

"I bought these to help for my schooling. I am very pleased with the fast delivery. The sound quality of these is pretty good. The initial setup took me a few minutes to get the right ear bud linked to the left, but i believe that was do to my errors. There is no lag when watching videos. I was able to watch 2 hours worth of lectures for college classes without the need to charge. the case is durable and has good weight to it. I highly recommend these to people. Now i also tried them when working out, but they kept trying to come out when jogging. Walking or other exercises was perfectly fine. Very pleased with this purchase.",5,1,2019-7-28,1,0,1

"Overall excellent product! These also work great in the shower. The only thing I would have liked to see is the ability to have just one active at a time if desired. I use one earbud often for specific reasons, and I have to place a small piece of paper under the connectors in the case to keep the earbud I’m not using from turning off. This keeps the second earbud-disconnected-beep from repeating in the earbud I’m using. This is probably a highly uncommon situation, but thought I’d share it regardless. Again, these are an excellent product and I’m very please with them.",5,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0
"Purchased these to replace wired earbuds that my puppy chewed up. I was pleasantly surprised that these have good sound and easy set up. They also have noise reduction and you can use both or just one at a time.  I've connected to my phone for listening to music (haven't tried calling someone yet as I've purchase these to listen to music and tv), and I've connected these to my smart tv. I had to go thru the steps twice to connect to the tv, as only the right earbud had sound the first time, however, I believe that was because I didn't wait until the two buds connected to each other before connecting to the tv bluetooth.  Overall, I'm happy with this purchase.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"I bought these because they had great reviews. And it's true, they do sound great. They stay in my ears well. I use the smallest ear hole pad that they supplied and they fit well and are not uncomfortable. I use them often in the pool but according to the instructions they don't recommend staying under water with them for too long, which is not a problem for me as I usually just chill on float anyhow.But what makes TOZO a  great company is that after two months I was having trouble with the right bud so I sent an email asking about my warranty. They responded the same day and were very sympathetic. Two days later there were brand new headphones on my doorstep. This was some of the best customer service I have ever experienced!",5,1,2019-8-9,1,0,0
"Technology has come a long way from what it used to be, and wireless headphones/earbuds are one of them. These earbuds in particular are definitely worth checking out. There are so many new wireless earbud technology coming out, and this is one you might want to get. It has some pretty good highs, mids, and even lows. If you want to test out a bass intensive song, these should not disappoint. For complete experience, I cannot really complain about the sound quality. They come packaged neatly with a charging dock that you can use multiple times before recharging the dock itself, so you won't lose your world of music or other uses for the earbuds. I haven't had problems with them yet, but I'll keep on the lookout.",4,1,2019-1-9,1,1,0
"I haven't used these a whole lot yet, but they definitely present a great first impression! They fit great, sound great, paired perfectly, and I absolutely love the charging case.

If my opinion changes after a bit more use I'll update my review, but for now these seem to be high quality earbuds at an extremely reasonable price.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,1,0
These work great when they actually work. Im constantly trying to get them to charge. They have to be plugged in when you undock them for them to work cant just throw them in a gym bag and go.

Worked well a handful of times and then had lots of issues.,3,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
Been tied to my cell phone in travels and at properties I own.  Always in my pocket and can't dig it out in time.  These blue tooth buds have made my life less complicated and simplified.

"Just received the TOZA T10 true wireless headphones. So far I am blown away! They arrived a day earlier than expected. They sound incredible and the volume gets much louder than the other set of Bluetooth earbuds I have. They paired to each other and to my phone very easily, just follow the couple steps in the instructions and ready to go. They fit into my ear almost perfectly and come with 4 sets of rubber sizes for ear types. The case feels very durable and has satisfying magnets to hold the ear pieces in place while storing and charging. So far I'm blown away by them and the only nit pick is the on ear controls don't allow for track skipping or volume control, but I likely wouldn't use them anyways even if they did. I definitely recommend.",5,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
"I wanted to purchase Apple's wireless earpods but then I found this product on Amazon. The price and the reviews made me take the plunge to purchase it. I have had it for one day now and I have to say that I am really impressed with the product. I have used it on my daily train commute to work for listening to music on my phone, used it in a call and used it in the gym during workout. The sound quality is great and mic seems to work great too. The size is small enough that it fits well within the ear and it doesn't fall off. The only improvement I would suggest is to add more controls in the buttons so it could be used to skip tracks etc.",4,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"These earbuds worked fine-until they didn’t. The left one stopped pairing with the right one, so I can only connect one or the other to a device at a time. Emailed to see a replacement and was prompted to try resetting them, which I have tried to do over a dozen times in the last week. I have yet to receive a reply to my second message I have barely been out running lately as it is not very motivating to run in the city when only one earbud is providing music. Very disappointed with customer service. I bought these specifically because they had high ratings by people with small ear canals. While the sound was often muffled because of the angle at which I had to insert device to avoid it falling out, I could live with it. I can’t live with only one working earbud.",2,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
"This item is... ok. If you’re looking for something to work out in, not for you. The way that it’s designed makes the back too heavy and in the end it just falls out when ever you move up and down (I.e. running, yoga, swimming, not gonna work out). The sound is decent, it’s loud and over all pretty average, an ok amount of bass behind it as well, but the left bud is quieter than the right. The connection is pretty bad. Sometimes I’ll just be sitting and I’ll rest my hand on my head and the sound will cut out in the left ear bud. Also, it only sometimes automatically connects to your phone, and while the right headphone is supposed to be the “master” bud, the left one will attempt to lead as well and then neither of them work with the phone, just causing more steps. I think that there are better products for the price, it was my first wireless earbud purchase, and I think it’s ok for my first run, but not a great item.",3,1,2019-5-2,1,0,0
"I received these recently and so far so good. They sound great I listen during workouts. They don't slip out. The range is pretty good you dont have to carry your phone in your pocket.

The range is great, I walk around and no one thinks anything. My rating went from 4 to 5 nice product.",5,1,2019-6-25,1,0,0
"I have both the T6 and T10. I like both, but so prefer these. The touch on the T6 is a bit sensitive. But I prefer the case for those more as they fit my pocket easier.

"The monumental cons: I knew as soon as I put these on they were trash. As soon as I queued up some test music, the popping began. Go ahead, try it with any music that features trumpet such as Stan Getz or electric guitar such as Metallica's And Justice for All. These earbuds can't handle high treble sounds to save their life. Period. I'm avoiding all earbuds in this price range for now as they all seem to be of poor construction. The pros: Good punchy bass and noise cancellation.",1,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
",These earbuds fit the bill perfectly for me!  The set-up instructions are clear and concise, and pairing was easy.  The extra earcaps allowed me to find the right fit so the earbuds were comfortable.  Sound quality is great for what I need them for.  I have not used them much yet, as I just received them.  The only thing I had a little difficulty with is pressing the center control button, as it seems to push into my ear instead of ""clicking"" to use the functions.  Maybe that will get easier as I get used to them. The charging case is small and durable and allows you to see the status of the charge without opening the case.  Overall, I'm very happy with them so far!",5,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
"I really wanted to like these for running. Unfortunately, compared to my older and cheaper wireless buds, these have a much shorter range. While running the sound cuts in and out constantly, if I am not moving it's fine. I never had this issue before with my other earbuds. The rechargeable base and holder are great, but those features dont make up for the poor reception. A separate note is that the volume level between 0 and the first step up is higher than I would have liked.",2,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I work remotely with folks daily and have tested dozens of earbuds over the years.  The pass or fail is very quick.  With this new product, I really wanted them to work, and probably kept them too long.  They drop signal, people can't hear you well, sound quality is poor.  They are bulky compared to other earbuds and frankly ugly.  Its like having a black bolt sticking out of your ear.  I finally text Amazon support late one night so frustrated that they gave me a refund.  I don't know who these folks are that are giving good ratings, but this product is crap.  I took my refund and bought a pair of  Alterola IE800 Bluetooth 5.0, which I've had for two months and have given them a review rating of 4.5.  They are excellent and look good.  I hope this review saves at least one person the frustration I went thru.",1,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0
What I mostly like about it is that the sound is great. I was looking for some earbuds that worked very well when I’m video chatting with my colleagues overseas via FaceTime and Google Meets. When listening to music the sound is clear and love the base. The carrying case is cute and has a strap you can add on. This help a lot do to I carry my keys and stuff around my neck so I can add this to the key chain from the strap. The battery life is good so far being that I just got it today.

Impressive base, compared to my previous earbuds and noise cancellation impressive as well. Pairing took only a few seconds with my iPhone 8+.

Also, I am able to leave my phone upstairs and still have good sound quality without degradation when I am downstairs. If you are looking to control your playlist from these, that is not an option but is also not a deal breaker for me.I am impressed with the sound quality for the price I paid.

"This is my second pair of true wireless ear buds but my first from TOZO.  The sound quality is so much better than my first pair that i bought from a different company and paid over 4 times the amount I spent on these. I even wore these while riding my motorcycle and not once did they feel like they were going to come out. The first time i pared them to my phone took less than 20 seconds and now when i remove them from the case they are connected before i get the first one in place! Music is a very big part of my life and my music which is heavy and fast sounds great and very clear!! I am about to order another pair for my girlfriend so she will leave mine alone. If anyone would ask me if they should by these I would absolutely tell them yo order now because they are missing great sounds!!

"First wireless earbud ever owned - after comparison shopping and some research, i chose these and i have to say i am glad i did. Great sound - good bass and crisp treble. Some issues connecting and pairing first time but could be because didn't read instructions. Reset the buds and they paired and connected with my Android without a hitch. No issues with connectivity on subsequent usages. Pausing the earbuds with the button does not stop the audio play - just mutes it. Have to pause in the app you are listening to if you need to stop playback temporarily. As for fit, these buds are lightweight and one of the 4 sizes of rubber grommets included should keep them in place. I have to push these bud back in now and then but over all they have stayed in place with jogging for 30 min. Recommended purchase!",5,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0
I REALLY wanted to love these wireless earbuds because the sound was phenomenal... but the battery life was minimal (normally only lasted an hour or two max) which made carrying the charging case a must.

Disappointed to say the least.,2,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0

"Everything exceeds expectations.  I went swimming twice the first day, sure, it disconnects just under water but it immediately reconnects back above water.  great sound for tiny earbuds, i like that i can turn them off.  its surprising to see way more expensive earbuds that you cannot even turn off, thereby, wasting any remaining battery putting unnecessary extra wear on the battery. volume control and ability to skip the song from the earbuds would make it a 10-star product!",5,1,2020-7-14,1,1,0

It sounds like I'm standing in an empty room and all you can hear is your music playing, even when I'm at the busy gym with the gym's loud music playing.  However, the left ear piece constantly cuts out then fades back in and crackles occasionally as well. Even when I'm holding my phone right next to them. I did that just to make sure I wasn't interfering with the connection somehow. I have sent for a new set. If they work without a problem I will be very pleased. I will keep them at 4 stars because of the hassle of returning them.",4,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0
"I've been looking for bluetooth buds for a while. I originally had the collar style by LG.  But $160 for the TONE platinum I thought I was getting my money's worth. I was wrong. I had nothing but problems.  The sound quality wasn't top notch and for the price I paid, I was very disappointed. Also I was always bound to have my phone near me otherwise I'd lose the signal.  The collar would always shift and turn while wearing. So after my disappointing impulse purchase I decided to go with a wireless bud style. I'm very happy with the T10. Sound quality is very good and I like that Im able to use one bud . The wireless charging is nice and the case also holds a charge so I'm not bound to carrying around a charging cable. The T10's are also very lightweight so they're very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  I would highly recommend these to anyone.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"The sound quality was great, but after trying all of the rubber ear caps that you put on the earbuds, the earbuds kept falling out of my ears. The booklet has helpful hints and directions on how to put the earbuds in your ear, but nothing helped. I had to wear a headband over my ears/head to keep them in place just to wear them.  In my case these buds are top heavy and rotate out of the ear.",2,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"While searching for earbuds on Amazon I had plenty to choose from, but I was looking for an affordable entry-level set since this is the first time I've ever purchased a Bluetooth earpiece/headphones.  My criteria was price, fitment, sound quality and ease of use.  I feel like I scored with these.  They were super easy to connect and the sound is very good.  My ears can be hard to fit and I definitely wanted something that wouldn't keep popping out as I work or exercise and these hold pretty well.  I don't have much to compare it to since it is my first set, but I'm very happy with these and don't plan on buying a more expensive set anytime soon.  Good purchase!",5,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0

They don't fall out on the treadmill or while lifting and they are great in all situations. It's crazy how well these little things cancel the outside noise. The charging case makes it super convenient so that I can go days without worrying about them dying.

"Earlier this year when we started going through COVID, my old Bluetooth headphones went out. I needed a new pair. I had been meaning to try out buds for a while, but didn't want to spend the money for AirPods. So I found TOZO and got them in April. I've been using them ever since. They're super easy to use, recharge and work exactly as advertised.The only bummer was that I must've synced them to one too many devices and I think the headphones were on without me realizing it. I put the volume up too high on a podcast and busted the right bud. I messaged TOZO on FB Messenger and they responded immediately. They were kind enough to help me get a replacement bud.  Really appreciate their customer service.",4,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"The case it's great, magnetically closed and the earbuds and held in magnetically which is a nice feature, they self seat to the charger. The BASS is amazing on these things. Two down sides are that the buttons don't cycle through the music and the left earbud only connects through the right one so you have to use the right one if you want over bud at a time.",4,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0

Switching bluetooth connections is very smooth (tested on my Pixel XL).",5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0
"The sound quality is amazing for the price. The lack of skip track functionality sucks but overall it's a great deal for the price.

"First set died within just a few uses.  I'm walking laps in the pool for physical therapy.  Hardly extreme use.  I wanted waterproof for in case they got splashed, not to use underwater (signal won't travel through water anyway).  They had me send in for a replacement.  Second set died after a few months.  Well, one of them did.  Was not able to return for a refund.  I was offered a replacement for the dead side, but no refund.  Not worth the hassle.  Will not purchase from this manufacturer again.Note that they will tell you they need to dry out.  I let it sit for over two weeks and it never regained function.",2,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"I use them everyday in the hot tub. I’ve also used them in the steam room. I like that if your charging them with a Micro-USB cable you can fold the cover all the way back so they can dry better while they charge.

"I needed these for calls more than listening to music while working out, and for that purpose these get the job done well. I had someone call me with these so I could hear the audio from the other end, and it's perfectly clear with no static or breaking. Music quality on these is great, but it doesn't have the heavy bass and other qualities I've read about in higher end products. I'd rate the sound quality as slightly lower than Apple's earpods (never used the airpods), so that should give you an idea of how good these are. Pairing was easy. Still testing the controls. So far so good.",5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"I’m really disappointed in these headphones. I’m not sure if I got a bad pair or what, but the charging case doesn’t hold a charge at all! I will fully charge them, use the headphones once for maybe 20-30 minutes and place the headphones back in the case. Then if I try to use them the next day or two or three days later, everything is completely dead. How do the headphones die when the case is supposed to charge them when they are in it?! I shouldn’t have to charge the headphones before every single use. It’s so annoying and disappointing. I’m past the return date on amazon, so now I’m stuck with these duds.",1,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"The headphones have messed with the audio of every device I have connected them to in new and mysterious ways. On my phone they like to randomly turn the left side on and off repeatedly. On my computer they have decided that they determine when my calls should end, often totally preventing me from making calls like I otherwise could.They do sound good when they work. But I would like them to work more.",1,1,2020-6-2,1,1,0
"I love the T10 earbuds. I have the kind of ears that will not hold Apple earbuds. They just fall out. I have not been able to find others that stay in my ears reliably, until I bought the T10s. I did 50 jumping jacks wearing the earbuds yesterday morning, and they stayed in place! Today, I gave them a more rigorous trial. I did a 30-minute P90X3 workout called CVX that involves lots of jumping up and down - lots of impact. The earbuds stayed in place the whole time - no problem! The sound is so good, that although I have done this workout at least 20 times in the past, this time, I heard parts of the commentary that I had never heard before. My previous earbuds had carrying cradles with hooks that went over the ears. They worked fine as long as there was not abrupt movement or bouncing. Then they would come loose and fall off. This even happened when I was on my rowing machine. The T10s, in contrast, are rock steady regardless of my movements. I also find that they pair easily with my iPhone, and my iPad, and my MacBook Air. And while I had trouble with my old earbuds when trying to switch from one device to another, the T10s are a breeze to switch between devices. I've only owned the T10s for 3 days, but so far, they seem to be an excellent product.",5,1,2019-5-8,1,0,0
"These earbuds far exceeded my expectations for the price. Primarily use them to listen to music to go to sleep without disturbing my wife (or being disturbed by her snoring! Sorry, honey...) Sound quality is good, noise cancellation is good; I can't hear her mild-to-moderate snoring next to me when they are on. Battery life is good, also. I have the headphones on for anywhere from 4-6hrs per night and only need to charge them twice a week. I highly recommend. I'd give 5-stars, but I don't know what to judge them against since it seems I got lucky on my first pick!",5,1,2019-10-18,1,1,0

They are more bigger and heavier than I thought in my case doesn’t fit well in my ears.

"Unboxed and fully charged the charging box and earbuds, charge for the earbuds only lasted 45 minutes after charging for 45 minutes. Once connected sound cuts out while walking.... Sound cuts out if I wave my hand over my phone... Cuts out if I put my phone in my pocket.... Cuts out for literally no reason even when phone is in my hand and total distance from phone to war buds being barely 2 feet.Sound quality is great but the fact that an ant fart interrupts the Bluetooth connection makes them unusable.",1,1,2020-5-30,1,1,0

If they do have buttons, they are stuck. It feels completely flat with no give. They connect about 50% of the time, and there is no volume control (no buttons/extremely flat and stuck buttons). Also, they feel like different headphones all together because the khaki ones say primary and secondary instead of left and right.

I'm super happy with the purchase and would highly recommend this to everyone.",5,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
These earphones are honestly the best purchase I've ever made. I'm a really picky person so this is an honest opinion of this product. The tozo earbuds really do secure onto your ears without any chance of it falling off especially during a workout which is full of movement. I've had these for about a month and these are great for the price and quality and comparable to Apple Earbuds or dare i saw BETTER.I recently lost my carging case in which the eabuds go in and I applied for the year time warranty discussing the incident and they responded the next day reassuring me they can do some arrangements for the loss. I'm currently waiting what the next step is so I'll keep you updated! Also when applying for the 1 year warranty they added a free wireless charger so I'm excited to see how that goes.,5,1,2019-9-19,1,0,0

"I’ve owned these since June.  I leave these by my desk to use while working.  What doesn’t make sense to me (as I own another kind of ear bud that I leave in the kitchen to use while not working), is the battery life.  The battery on these drains without me getting full use of the ear buds.  So, if I didn’t use them for a week (due to vacation or other reasons), when I go to use them, I find that the battery needs to be charged again.  My other ear buds don’t drain that quickly at all, so I don’t know that these are worth the cost.",3,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"The initial pairing of the Tozo T10s is pretty simple! I really like that they come with multiple size inserts to fit different ear profiles. I spent the first few days of owning them trying out different inserts before settling on the medium size. They aren't noise canceling but when I establish a good seal I have trouble hearing people when they speak to me even if I don't have any audio playing through my ears. Battery life is solid for a several hour study session and they will definitely last for a couple days of moderate use; but I like to charge them nightly with my phone because I'm always using them and I would rather not be inconvenienced with having to charge them during the day and having to have a silent study sesh or workout.Overall, I have a hard time seeing how these earbuds can be beaten for the price of $50!",5,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0

I called Amazon tech support to assist but they determined it was a bad pair and sent me a replacement. After 5 months of use I am experiencing the same problem. The right ear bud will not pair to the left one any longer. The sound of these head phones is great when you can get them to work. I’ve determined that I will try out a different brand as I expect $50 earbuds to last longer than 5 months.Received these wireless earbuds to use at the gym.

"Fast delivery, great packaging, product looks great and easy to connect. I've been using them for approx 24hrs and haven't tried anything water related and don't expect I will. Sound quality is really good, however I did experience a few pops/sound dropouts while walking around with phone in my packet (IE phones was very close and shouldn't have had connection issues). My only complaint is battery life...I am only getting approx 2hrs continuous playback time between calls and music. Even though they come with a charging case I can carry with me it's certainly a disappointment to have to charge them every 2hrs which interrupts me using them. I was expecting the 4hrs+ advertised.

"This product is great! The sound quality and bass truly astounded me for the price. I originally had a little difficulty getting the right earbud to stay in my ear (a typical problem for me), but with adjusting the earpiece and doing a little twisting, it works great. I encountered a problem within one week of purchasing where the right earbud stopped working, but I emailed the company and they immediately responded and let me know that they would send me a brand new pair (without even having to send the old ones back)! Even if the product didn't sound as fantastic as it does, I'd back it simply because the company so assuredly stands behind their product! They also are excellent with noise cancellation as they ended up stopping working during the middle of my workout, but I kept them in because of how good they canceled out my surroundings and helped me focus on my lift!",5,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0
So far so good. One gripe would be having to push the button on the each ear piece for its features. All that does is shove them into my ear hole. Virgin ear holes no longer.

Ok so I'm a nurse 🤘 and I bought these about a month ago to wear inconspicuously while at work (when I'm charting or doing something else not involving direct patient care obviously! Get off it you vultures!!) Normally I just have one in so that I can still hear all the call lights and various emergency calls 🙄 alright so nursing is EXTRA stressful with all the 'rona goin round. I absentmindedly left one of these in my scrub jacket pocket and when I get home I immediately strip down before I go in the house and throw that shit in the wash 🤮 fast forward to me folding laundry and I find this little guy.

They sent me a new set based on my very minor issues! I didn't even complain they just read my review and initiated a solution! Fantastic service! It turns out my first set had a battery issue and these are perfect now. 10/10!",5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"What I like about these headphone is that they are relatively cheap compared to other wireless headphones on the market, without compromising the quality of it. These headphones are great at cancelling background noise from your environment, and they are also very small and not so noticeable. The sound quality is quite clear and the range for volume is within reason. The only improvement I can see is a longer battery life that can last at least a day rather than a quarter. However, I do like how the charger is portable so you can charge your headphones later on the day if you run low on battery.",5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
Very happy with these earbuds I would suggest that you make sure that you get the proper fitting for your ear it does come with I believe three or four different sizes so I took the time to make sure his size worked and followed instructions on putting them in and turning them it does make a huge difference. The waterproofing is good for swimming or taking a shower. I noticed that when you’re in the shower the sound is even better because you get water that goes onto the air Bud and your ear and it creates a perfect seal in the base comes out even better. For the price I am very satisfied with these earbuds!,5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"I love these headphones. I use them for ""headphone dance parties"" where I dance to a song that is synced to my dance partners. We dance to the same song playing at the same time without making noise around us. The earbuds stay in doing twirls and dynamic movements. I wish the battery lasted a little bit longer, but with earbuds so portable and high quality, it's not a big deal to me. I can still dance until I am tired! Overall I'm really happy with these headphones.After about 6 months of using them the charging case stopped working- I contacted TOZO and they have provided me excellent customer service. They will be sending me a replacement case at no charge. Fabulous!",5,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0
"The earbuds connected quickly and easily. Sound quality is good, much better than expected. With the multiple sizes of silicone earbud fittings included, the fit is great. Wireless charging is an added bonus and gives one the option of being completely cord free. Case is solid and sturdy and the LED lights show when buds are charging as well as the internal battery level (case). I'd recommend these and after seeing mine, have already gotten a coworker to get a pair.",5,1,2019-4-1,1,0,0
"I wanted to like these ear buds SO badly. Everything for quality checks were great: fantastic sound, good charger and battery life, good Bluetooth connection.BUT I can’t use them whatsoever. I’ve tried all of the different sizes of rubber ear plugs (idk the term) and put the in correctly according to the directions (with the upside down twist) but they still won’t stay in FOR OVER A MINITE! I’ve never had this problem.....and again I’ve tried all the sizes but think I am too late to return and they might be hard to sell idk.",2,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0

"I love how discreet they are, even more than AirPods in my opinion. The nose cancellation and the sound quality are amazing; I can hear and feel the bass of certain songs and the volume never has to be very loud for me to not hear anything but the song I'm playing. The best part is that the earphones charge in their case so even though the battery life is 3 hrs (from full charge to zero), it ends up being longer if you always put them back in the case.",5,1,2019-5-22,1,0,0
"I buy these earplugs mainly for work, so I want them to be wireless and a little bit discrete. These earplugs are great for me. I'm worried about buying earplugs from Amazon because of all the scammers there, but I'm very impressed. They're small, they have good connectivity and sound quality. I want to know that they're going to stay in good shape because I walk around a lot, and my ears are small, but they're fine, they have buds of different sizes, and they're great. And it also has a portable charger. Its shell can hold about four hours of charging, so if they disappear on the way, you can charge your buds on the road. Overall, it was a good deal for me and I have recommended them to some of my colleagues.",5,1,2020-10-3,1,0,0
I received these as a gift and loved them. They produce great sound and are very comfortable. One earbud ceased working and I contacted their customer service. They responded very quickly and resolved the issue by sending me a new set.  Great company to work with. I would highly recommend and buy again. Thanks for standing behind your product.UPDATE:  I received my replacement 2 DAYS after contacting customer service with my problem. I could not imagine receiving such fast and satisfactory service. Again great product produced by a great company.  Again many thanks!,5,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"I tested the earbuds more than a week. This is my best wireless earbud so far.Compared with another wireless earbud I previous used, TaoTronics TT-BH026 https://amzn.com/gp/product/B074QKS8RK, TOZO T10 outperforms on the Bluetooth link speed, and the battery life.",5,1,2019-7-26,1,0,1
Update:The company reached out to me to provide a replacement. I received it and it works fine. I might have earlier received one from a bad batch.,4,1,2019-7-25,1,0,1
Battery didn’t last as long as my last wireless earbuds. Have used several times and they won’t stay in my ears.Seller contacted me and offered to replace the defective earbuds. Received different style and they do work better and stay in longer. Battery life is longer. Please note it is a completely different item than this one. So my review of this item still stands but seller did make up for the original item that didn’t work for me.,4,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
"These are pretty simple to use even before you read the directions (I would recommend reading them anyway). The charging box is very compact and the earbuds fit in very easily and stay put. The earbuds themselves have decent sound quality for this price point, but they do have some sound coloring to compensate for the small speaker (this is pretty standard). The amount of extra ear cups is nice too because I usually have to try them all before I find the ones I find most comfortable. I can't say much about the water proof claims as I would never wear headphones or any electronic device around water, regardless of branding. I do wish the battery life was a little longer. They also have very nice packaging. Overall I'm satisfied.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"These are the best Bluetooth headphones I've ever purchased. The battery life is amazing. The case is amazing, it's constantly charged. The fit is amazing. Now regarding the actual fit there was a trick that I did to make them fit perfectly. If anyone is use to work earplugs you know that the recommended way to apply them us to pull (the top of) your ear back and I sent the plugs in. Now, same applies to these headphones. Pull your ear back and insert each headphone in while twisting it clockwise. Once you let go of your ear the plastic piece will form to your war canal and create a perfect fit. Once I did this trick the fit was amazing, the sound was incredible the bass is 10x better. Totally recommend!!",5,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I tend to lose one when I am planking or doing pushups. I always have an issue with finding the right size for my ears. So it's not the buds it is my ears. These are great for the summer workouts here in Florida. The sound is great and phone calls are clear.,4,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"Just got these today. They are very nice! Easy to pair, good quality, feel expensive not cheap and since I got the rose gold I shouldn’t lose them as easily as my old ones which were black and I lost frequently. I love the charger and I can tell these will be one of my favorite Amazon buys. Great item for the price.",5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"These are pretty solid, if the bluetooth range to the device was better, these would be the best head phones I have ever purchased. The batterylife is pretty good, the only think that stinks is the headphones won't work if the case is out of battery when you pull them out.The range worked okay the first day, then when I put my phone in my pocket to go for a run, the sound kept going in and out. I took my phone out of my pocket and it was fine again, and if my phone was in my pocket upside down it wasn't as bad. Seems to me it needs a direct line of connection with nothing blocking the connection (my arms while running or the bottom of my pocket when it was right side up).",3,1,2019-9-15,1,0,0
"I never ever write reviews but I had to for these. I have gone through many pairs of wireless headphones, but this was the first truly wireless set I owned. I wanted pro airpods, but I opted to spend a mere fraction of the cost on these. I am really impressed with the sound quality! Bass is very important to good drum and bass, and there is no lacking bass in these headphones. They are really lightweight, fit in your ear great, and have a great case that recharges them. If you were thinking about getting these, do it!",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"Overall these are very nice headphones. If you position them correctly in your ears they sound kind of amazing. Even bass notes come through nicely. But it's all about positioning them properly in your ear.  I really was impressed when listening to certain songs with these.  I'm used to tinny sound out of earbuds but these really sound nice.Only minor issues I have are sometimes I need to manually connect and other issue is that if you connect only one headphone, for a couple minutes that single headphone will beep waiting to connect its partner. It doesn't do this if you use both headphones.",4,1,2019-10-8,1,0,0
"You get exactly what you think you will with these headphones. An amazing quality product for an extremely affordable price. Folks. I've always been the type to speculate and say ""Yeah I'm sure there's a flaw with these somewhere"". This is truly one of those moments where a product is too good to be true - but has no faults and is well worth the buy. Just get a pair already.",5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"The earbuds are nice my wife uses them and seems to enjoy them.  She does wish the R & L were more easily read on the buds.  She's new to Bluetooth earbuds, but seems to like them.  The sounds is good to mike seems good as well. Last minor gripe, is that the mildy hurt her ears after a short while. The built, the charger pod, the easy of connection, and the sound quality make these winners!",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"I purchased these to use in my office because of the chatty kathy's, but I find myself using my new earphones while I workout, listen to audiobooks, and streaming on the plane. These are AMAZING! I hear literally no outside noise when these are in use. Nice bass and overall sound. I've been using most days for the last 2 months and the battery life still holds out well (about 4 hours). When not in use, I just pop them in their case and they charge wirelessly on the go. They're also my go-to for talking on the phone. They fit perfectly in my ears and have absolutely no problem with the transmission (on the receiving and talking end).Highly recommend!",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
I bought these earbuds about a week ago. I am very happy with my purchase so far. They sound great and have been  trouble free for the most part. The first time I used them the left ear piece would cut in and out. I put them in their case and fully charged them and then did a reset and have not had the problem since. I have used them with both my cellphone and my PC and they have worked excellent. I only use them a couple hours at a time and then put them back in the case for charging and storage. Time will tell how durable they are.,5,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0
"With over 4K reviews, mostly favorable, I thought, for the price, why not?  Bad decision.  The sound quality is fine, that is if they would stay in my ears.  I have tried every attachment that came with the phones, and I spend a lot of my time picking them up, from the floor, car seat, etc.  I’m moving back to my trusty ear phones.",2,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"Update:This newer version of the T10 is even better than the original. Same great sound quality, a bit lighter overall. The packaging is professional. The controls are easy. Quality is still outstanding. Great value for the price.",5,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"Great sound quality for a great price. Only reason I rated a 4 star is because I have not figured out how to control volume when using it with my 4K Firestick watching TV. Seems I have no control of volume. That may be on me and open to any suggestions someone may have.  Level that comes out however is comfortable. Other than that works great with my phone and Nexus 7 pad. Volume level is controllable and quality is much better than cheap pair I had previously purchased and as good as very expensive pair I had tried. Storage/charging box is very convenient and takes away any anxiety one may have as far as using for a long time. Charges very fast , both ear buds and charging box. Charged case to full when I received it and still at full after a day. Buy them, you'll be glad you did.",4,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"I give this product 5 stars because it's a great product for the price. It's a sturdy, low profile, and stylish. I haven't tested its waterproofing yet but there's a sketch of a guy swimming with them in the manual. The sound quality is good. However, if you're an audiophile and are meticulous about sound quality, you may find the sound in these ""satisfactory"". Honestly, you're probably not going to find a much better sound in earbuds of this nature and price. But overall, a good buy if you're looking for a cheaper alternative to airpods.One thing I need to note; you may find people saying these earbuds have good noise canceling. While it is good, don't mistake it for ""active"" noise canceling. These earbuds will block as much sound as you'd think plastic and electrical components would. So just keep that in mind.",5,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0
"I recently started working out on daily basis and I was sick of the wired ear phones that would get in the way of my hand and arm movements. For the wireless earbuds, I initially was considering the airpods, however it's very costly and I tried them feeling not very comfortable with them in my ears. I searched online and found the positive feedback on this Tozo T10. Got it and put it on and immediately was fascinated by its sound quality. There were four sizes of rubber pieces to try and the smallest ones fit me. Don't forget to slightly turn them backwards so that they would fit snugly. Now I wear them every time I work out, morning runs, lunch time gym, and home core trainings. My husband is now jealous of me having them and he's asking for a pair!",5,1,2019-8-29,1,0,0
"Wonderful sound!  Easy to use and most of all a great price!  Numerous ear buds for any ear size.  I also bought TOZO wireless charger for my phone and these ear buds. It’s outstanding too!  I was so impressed that I told all the people at work about these headsets and they bought some and were thrilled with them! The only con is when you change the ear bud part it takes a little patience. They fit pretty tight on there. If somebody has an easy way of doing this please post, that would be great!",5,1,2019-9-7,1,1,0
"I love these earphones.  They're much more liberating to wear than headphones/earbuds with cords.  Plus they aren't annoying like traditional ""over the ear"" earphones.  The sound quality is great, and using the mic for calls works well.  My friends can hear me better than when I used a collar version of mic/earbuds.  I wish I could wear these all day.  My only disappointment is that the 3-3.5 hours or charge goes by too quick.  I think I'll need to pairs to recharge one while listening to another.  Then problem solved!  Thanks Tozo!",5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
"I was going through wired headphones at an unsustainable rate (the cable was fraying and I'd only get sound from one side) and decided to make the jump to wireless earbuds. I found great reviews for these earbuds both on Amazon and elsewhere and used that as reason to purchase them. The sound is great (though I'm listening to podcasts 99% of the time instead of music), and the noise cancellation is something I've never experienced before (I will literally keep them in my ears not listening to something if I don't want to get distracted by noise). I did run into one issue with the earbuds, and emailed the company for help, when their recommended fix didn't work they sent me a new earbud. I respect companies that stick by their product.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
I usually don't leave reviews but I had to on this one.  These buds are absolutely amazing!!  I'm not planning to take them swimming so the whole waterproof thing doesn't really apply to me but the quality coming out of these little guys is *unreal*.  I have those huge $400 Bose over-ear headphones and the quality is basically identical (only these have deeper bass).  I can't stress enough how amazing these are - ESPECIALLY for the price!  Easily the best headphones I've ever owned.  Will definitely be buying more as gifts.,5,1,2019-8-13,1,0,0
"Bought these earbuds to wear at the gym. At home they worked just fine, although the audio quality isn't perfect it's certainly decent for what I'd expect at the price. However, when I was at the gym I found I had this consistent problem with the audio skipping while running. If I kept my phone on the elliptical it was fine, but if it was in my pocket the songs would keep cutting in and out. I'm not sure if it's because there are so many other bluetooth devices in one room or my body blocking the connection but I don't have the issue at home. And I never had that problem with other, even cheaper, bluetooth connecting audio devices.I want to be able to keep my phone in my pocket, since I'm not always going to have somewhere in eye-shot to leave my phone out in the open to keep the connection stable.",3,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"So far so good. I’m very impressed with these earbuds, and It was a breeze to setup the pairing. Here’s a tip for getting the right fit - start with the smallest earbud sleeve, then go to next larger etc until one fits firmly and blocks out more ambient sound, so the bass sounds deeper. At this point the sleeve will also help with a snug fit. I pair it with my galaxy watch when I go jogging. And what’s cool is if you’re going walking or jogging with a friend you can share buds. Very good earbuds.",5,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0
"These wireless earbuds are really good. The sound is good and very clear. They come with 4 different tips so you can get a great fit, I didn’t need to change them from the ones that came on the earbuds. They charge quickly and last about 3 hours of continuously listening to music. I recommend them for quality and price. I did have an issue with the charging case and Tozo is replacing it free of charge.",5,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0
I have always just worn the Apple earphones that come with the Iphones and they never sound the way that the music actually sounds- if you know what I mean. I wanted headphones that would play music with bass and actually stay in my ears because when I work out or even walk the apple ones fall out. These are perfect and have a bunch of different nub things that fit to your ear so I tried them all and found the ones that fit me. They stay in even on a run and lifting weights/ etc. Very happy with bass and I don’t have to turn them up very loud to hear the music because they cancel noise. Great purchase. So much more for your money than Airpods or Beats.,5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"I checked the review before picking up a pair. These are my first wireless-charging earbuds. I purchased them to function with for my new phone, so I got them in white. They have a high quality 'feel' and look slick.  Like the other reviewers mention, its surprisingly great sound quality! These earbuds provide a clear definitely ""amped"" sound, not an expert but they sound high-end. They fit in my ear comfortably and are pretty secure even when I'm out and about. I was worried they would be pretty heavy, but so far I'm not complaining! Pairing was easy enough (just search for some how-to videos and figure it out if you're new to it). Last night I paired them with my laptop to watch shows. So far so good, and the battery life is holding up for a few hours last I checked. Definitely worth the price if you want mid-range earbuds.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
I bought these to work out and jog with. Without the jangling of a corded earbud. They don't fall out easily so that's good. Sound quality is good. It does the job. My problem with these is that I can hold one in my clenched fist and they will disconnect. Sometimes when im walking with my phone in my pocket the connection cuts. But besides that they are ok.,4,1,2019-2-24,1,1,0
"Great earbuds! I bought them for my new iPhone 11.Update: I really wanted these to work. But, they don't pair together. I have tried every possible thing to get them to work.

"I got these on Black Friday at about a 50% discount, so I would have been happy with quality generally available at that price level. I was surprised at how good they sounded, how well they fit, and how simple they are to keep charged.

"So I did want apple airpods but they are way to expensive. So I looked for the top rated earbuds within my budget and just so happened to find these. When they arrived I was honestly very surprised at how fast they shipped, and the sound quality is amazing. I thought that there had to be something wrong because of how cheap they were compared to air pods but instead i'm blown away with how good they are, and they don't just fall out of my ears like apple's earbuds do.",5,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0
"My previous pair of bluetooth earbuds cost about $25 and had better sound quality and less latency.  These are very bassy, so much that the mids and highs are lost in the mix. On top of that, the highs sound compressed (like radio fuzz) which I've never heard before on any headphone. Another problem is latency which makes watching videos annoying since the audio is behind the video just enough to take you out of the experience.  Because of these faults, I decided to return these. Some final comments, these fit nice and the build quality seems fine, I did not get to test the battery life so no comment on that.",3,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"Product was easy to setup and worked well right of the box. The sound was also pretty good compared to other wireless buds I have used in the past and the battery life is pretty decent. The reason I am giving it a one star rating however, is that they totally failed at the claim of being IPX8. After owning them for a short time (couple weeks), I dropped one of the buds on the ground and thought I would give it a quick rinse in the sink (we are in the midst of a global pandemic after all). Immediately after, the bud started cutting in and out. Later when I tried to recharge it the red led charge indicator refused to turn on and once it's battery fully died the right earbud no longer worked at all. Long story short, if you are looking for water proof buds look elsewhere.",1,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
I purchased 3 sets for my children.  We were very happy with these until my son dropped one of them in water and it stopped working.

The other 2 original sets are still working great.,5,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0
"Sound quality exceeded my expectations by a landslide, volume is decent too. The earbuds themselves fit incredibly well, very comfortable in general. Definitely seems to be waterproof as advertised, although not usable completely underwater, which is only a minor issue. Smaller than I expected, meaning they don’t stand out too much. The magnets on the charging case is a great touch and is a very convenient feature. I have no qualms when it comes to bluetooth pairing, it works perfectly as far as I can tell. Seems to be a great product all-around.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"This was a surprise in quality. I’ve ordered and returned other sets from other makers. These are really comfortable and don’t fall out nor leave your ears sore! That’s a big win!

"This is the second pair of random Chinese earbuds I have purchased on Amazon and they were both defective. The sound quality is OK, not good but not terrible either. The charging case is nice as it successfully extends the battery life pretty well.BIG PROBLEM: whenever I move around with these, like walking or working out, the slave earbud drops connection to the master for a second quite frequently. This is incredibly disruptive and frustrating. As long as I sit still like at a desk they are fine, but as soon as they get moving there are constant drops in connection. Indications of a faulty product or terrible quality control at the manufacturer. You get what you pay for, and these are just another set of relatively cheap Chinese electronics that may or may not serve you well.",2,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"These are really good for the price. They lasted 7 months of almost daily use (about 2-4 hours a day). I did have some issue when in heavily crowded areas, mainly large auditoriums. The sound would cut in and out.Now 7 months later the left earpods is no longer synced with the right one and the voice that says its status, a female voice, now sound super deep and slow.",4,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
Bought these to avoid spending 3 times as much on Airpods and am very happy with my decision so far. The sound is great for the price and they fit very well. I've used these on runs and have no problem with the headphones falling out. The bluetooth connectivity is pretty good. Every once in a while it seems best to reset the headphones by putting them back in the charging case and then removing them again to repair. This solves the issues that occasionally occur if you don't put them back in the charger and just turn them off and try to repair. The battery life so far seems to really be 3+ hours and the case is good for a few more charges.The only thing I missing is the ability to change volume and song via the button. The button allows for pausing only. This is only really a problems when on a run but is the thing preventing me from giving them 5 stars.,4,1,2019-4-10,1,0,0

"Easy to use and battery last really long. I use it for workout and running, no fall out even when I get pretty sweaty. The different sized ear plus cushions, came with the product, are helpful to find the right size that fits different ears.

"Hard to believe 70% of 30000 people could be so wrong. It has some good qualities: solid build, wireless charger, design. But the 2 main features, namely sound quality and connectivity, are far off the mark.

Sounds like playing from a match box. Really empty.",2,1,2020-1-25,1,1,0
"These were my very first pair of truly wireless earbuds and I was amazed of how great they sounded, good bass, and pretty clear highs. I'd say these are pretty good beginner friendly earbuds, easy to pair. and good design they fit good and can use them for their entire battery life without any sort of pain. And pretty long range I can walk away from my phone and I don't have to worry if it'll disconnect. And they have decent battery life and they take no time charge, pop them in for 30 mins and your ready to go. And I love how they are waterproof and I love showering with these and I don't gotta worry about a thing, just the best budget earbuds VERY worth their price. The only complaint is the button it kinda hurts to push but you eventually get used to it.",5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"If I hold my phone up in front of my face these thing sound great, but let's be real here, once hooked up we put our phones in our pockets and expect them to work just as good. I'm very disappointed in these earplugs. From all the good reviews I was excited for them to arrive, and was let down instantly",1,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
I wanted to wait a while before reviewing these earbuds because I wanted to make sure they lasted. My biggest concern is battery life. These last for several hours without losing connection or being uncomfortable. The music quality is good and they're an overall god bang for your buck. I recommend them.,5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"Update: (12/23/19)I got into contact with the seller's customer service and they were nothing but helpful with the process of my initial issue, they sent me a a brand new pair after attempting to trouble shoot the old earbuds I had initially purchase.  Wonderful Guest Service!",5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"It is so sad that my earbud does not remain in my ear. I am suppose to walk around and talk, exercise and talk or listen to music, however, this product fails woefully on all those counts. The thing has fallen from my ear so many times, that I no longer use it. Cant I cook and just listen to a nice instrumental? Well....Yes, except it falls from my ear every time. Maybe my ears are too small or something. product works fine if and only if it would remain in my ears!!!",3,1,2019-4-2,1,1,0
"The Earbuds worked OK for almost 8 months, then the left earplug started to sound duller and duller until it quit completely in August'20 (11 Months and a few days). The Batteries last for approx. 3 hrs.  before re-charging is required.Soundwise, they're OK, not the best but for the price not bad.",2,1,2020-9-28,1,0,0
"Sound quality is good for the price.  I would have rated the item higher except that the connection cuts in/out.  I wear these while doing yard work and while running...and listen to spotify, pandora, etc.  When doing yard work, my phone is in my front pocket.  When running, my phone is strapped to my upper arm.  In both instances, the connection with the earbuds cut in/out often when moving.I love the fit of the earbuds and the charging case is great...just issues with the connection which is a critical piece...",3,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"These earphones sound great! They should be more expensive than they are when you consider the quality of sound and overall convenience that they offer. The bluetooth linking is simple, charging is convenient and has great battery life, and they fit great. It took me a few tries using different sizes for the ear piece until i found the size that would stay in my ear the best. I can work out, run, jump, play basketball - do any physical activity with them and don't have to worry about them falling out of my ear. Highly recommend!",5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"Considering the price, these are absolutely fantastic truly wireless earbuds.  The sound quality is outstanding and they fit my ears perfectly.  They paired with my iPhone 7 in a matter of seconds and I have not had any instances of them disconnecting.  The power buttons, though small, are easy to use. While I have not yet wore them long enough to truly test the battery life I have no reason to suspect it to be bad.All in all a great value.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
This product is pretty good for a reasonable price. I enjoy the sound battery life is pretty good the one issue that I found is for some reason the right which is usually the more dominant bud well loses battery life much faster I wanted to say about 3 hours. Just out of curiosity I turned off the right but when the battery said low the left Bud still had 8 hours of charge left. That's a pretty significant difference.,4,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"Product feels and looks of amazing quality, sounds is great and bass sounds very deep, I do recommend tunning with equalizer to suit your taste of more or less treble. Noise cancellation is really good and the case has a battery to recharge on the go so you can get more if you do not have access to wall jack. Also you can choose to only have one on and paired which Is a really neat feature at this price point. To pair turn both of them on and on your device choose Right side and it will pair both. Really happy with my purchase and will be recommending these and most likely buying some in the future as well.Will be updating on waterproof abilities, once I get a good workout or use them to work outside.",5,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"I'm a vocalist and guitarist who has recorded and produced music privately for many years. I'm very picky about sound quality. I read a lot of good reviews so I decided to give these a chance due to the super cheap price point. I have not had these long enough to evaluate the battery life, but the sound quality is really nice. Really bright and crisp highs, clear mids and very punchy bass. I will try and update this review once I've seen how the batteries hold up. The charging case has a magnetic closure on the lid, which is super nice as well.",5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"I absolutely love these. I read a ton of reviews and I wasn't sure, but after receiving them. I love them. I always have a hard time with buds fitting in my ears because they are small and or staying in and these do both with the multiple size buds and they don't fall out or hurt. The sound is incredible. I definitely didn't think they would have that much bass in them. Absolutely will recommend!!",5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
The sound quality and bass reproduction are excellent vs other Bluetooth ear pieces I have tried. The only issue I have notice is they take a long time to connect to my phone once they are removed from the case. I have used them in the pool and while walking/running and had no issues with sound quality. I would have given 5 stars but there is the issue of them taking a long time to connect via Bluetooth and once in awhile I have lost connection to my phone when running and my phone was in my backpack.,4,1,2019-8-14,1,0,0
"First off for an inexpensive set of wireless earbuds the look and feel quality is impressive, for me the fit of earbuds is critical these were perfect for me out of the box, although they do come with several different sized tips. The sound quality for listening when music is very good this is my primary use case. Pairing was supper simple and quick with my iPhone XS, you can also use with just one earbud although it must be the right side for one ear use.",5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"Needed a set of headphones to work out with.  The highs and mids are perfect on these.  Do not expect the lows/bass to be extraordinary, because they aren't.  For in-ear headphones this was exactly what I was looking for--great battery life, great sound with minimal bass, and very comfortable on the ear canals!",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
sound quality was ok for a week. Now after a full charge they last 20 mins top. DO NOT BUY.  I emailed the company and expressed my concern and they didn't even bother to send a message back. Terrible customer service also...,1,1,2020-8-5,1,2,0
This pair of earphones are so great.  The sound quality and bass are superior and the price affordable.  I am  bummed it took me so log to find these.

"I was looking for some wireless earbuds that wouldn’t fall out while exercising and would have decent to very good sound quality. I think I found a winner. The ear-canceling design is so good, almost too good. The sound quality is clear. And this is the best-fitting earbud I’ve had, and I’ve had a few over the years. I see why this ear bud had close to 30K reviews with a 4.5 average rating.",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,1
"Ive had them not quite a full week yet. They take a little getting used to. I find that I want to readjust them in my ears often but I think that comes from me being afraid of them falling out... They never do, I'm just anxious. I think sound cancellation may depend on your ear hole size and shape. There have been instances where I thought the noise cancellation was awful but I think it was just douchebags being loud at the gym and not so much the earbuds themselves - maybe a little bit tho. So far I love them. They are quite useful in the gym - weight lifting, yoga, handstanding, running, dancing, all of that! They never fall out. They stay out of my way which is exactly what I wanted. I was using an LG Tone neck band before and it just got annoying. I think they're definitely worth the money and they come with a 1 year warranty! also the hands free call aspect is wonderrrrfulllll. over all I love this product.",5,1,2019-4-29,1,0,0
"The sound quality is great! I wanted wireless earbuds for running, but didn’t want to spend too much. I wasn’t even super picky on sound quality. However, these are actually really great so I’m all around happy! I’ve been wearing them for about 20 minutes and my ears don’t hurt, so that’s a plus as well... and I have ridiculously picky ears.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"I have been looking 6 years now for a way to go wireless with my phone and MP3 player.  These little bluetooth beauties from Tozo are by far the best I have tried.  I love the versatile charging system.  I work 10 hour days and listen to music from the time I leave home.  The battery life is  pretty average at 2 1/2 to 3 hours of continuous use, so I have 3 pair and get through the day changing them out as  needed.  Pairing is super easy.  The sound quality beats any of the wired buds.  As expected, it took a few tries to get the best fit, but once I figured out which size to use,  I rarely have problems with them falling out.  I have learned that chewing gum or eating will get them to fall out though.  These wireless ear buds are a great buy and the customer service is excellent.",5,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0
"This is great for sedimentary uses. I tried to use these for a jog and the earbuds kept falling out. It has great call quality, but the sound quality isnt the best (what can you expect from 45$ earbuds??) Lastly, when I was first pairing it with my phone, holy guacamole... it was a bit of a challenge. I had to play with it for a while even after reading the instructions. Battery life is great.",3,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
I bought these headphones because I previously had bluetooth headphones that had a small wire connecting the two earbuds together. I finally decided to just go all in and buy true wireless bluetooth headphones and I bought these because they were bass-boosted and had a fair price in my opinion. The carrying case charges the earphones when you're not using them and doesn't have to be plugged in to charge.Pros:,5,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0
After looking for a pair of wireless headphones for quite some time I decided on these. I am extremely happy with this decision so far. The battery life of the individual ear pieces isn't great. However; having the charging case with you easily allows you to use them all day with some short breaks to charge.I briefly tested the water proof feature in the shower and had no issues with connection or sound quality. I have read others had issues with sound quality when submerged so your mileage may vary on that.,5,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
"After breaking my last set of earbuds it was time to shop for a new set. I was really not interested in spending $140 for the Apple ipods although I'm sure they are great.

"I bought this headset a few weeks ago. The included ear pieces make it easy to adjust to your ear. The sound quality is very good as is the Bluetooth range. The charging case is a great design, because as others have said, it can charge the ear buds several times. Once the case is charged up, it can be unplugged and it acts as a portable charger for the ear buds.I had an issue with the right ear bud and contacted customer support. I received a reply the next day. They are sending me a replacement set.",5,1,2020-10-4,1,0,0
"Originally, I bought these buds for my brother in law for Christmas. He called me the next day and raved about how awesome they are, and how crystal clear the sound is. For my birthday, I decided to order some for myself. Right out of the box, I was extremely impressed with the ease of connection, and my brother is right - the sound IS awesome! I've had several more expensive earpieces in the past, none of which even compare to the sound quality with these buds. Additionally, they are comfortable to wear - even for long periods of time. I'm extremely happy with this purchase!",5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"Didn't like the difficulty of pairing both ear plugs and sometimes it pairs only one and the tapping the ear plugs to start the function wasn't that easy.

"***UPDATE WARNING*** {My Tozo 10 cuts in and out when just walking very frustrated I will be returning these. Maybe some people have been lucky.So far everything is average. Music is loud even on low volume. Has nice a case to charge earbuds lets you now when it done charging aka no light but has 4 blue lights when case if fully charge.  Very short charging usb cable ! Has no usb wall plug ! So you might get lucky if you have a spare or use your phone usb wall plug. I don't know who would go swimming with these on. I have yet to go in the extreme heat or sweating will update soon. Easy to pair, sounds seems to be stereo.",1,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
Update The Company sent me a free set of earbuds as the ones I had at first were bad and fell within there warranty period. The Overall Quality of customer service was great. The earbuds themselves still need a bit of adjustment made to improve the product but the replacement pair they sent work as described on there listing. The replacement pair is lot better then the fist set I had received. The experience has changed my opinion of the product going from 1 star to 5 star. I will not gig them on the overall quality of the product because you get what you paid for a set of Bluetooth earbuds that are waterproof with in there specs. I would buy products from this company in the future knowing that they will do what is right to fix any issues for which are covered under warranty. I hope this review helps others,5,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
"Sound quality is surprisingly really good, as well as the fit. They stay in your ears well unlike apples earbuds, these are very comfortable. I love the fact that the case serves as a charger and that you can put it on a wireless charging pad. Bluetooth pairing was super easy. My fiancé has apple’s AirPods and he was jealous of these. Love that these are superior quality for a great price!!",5,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"I love this product , I tried with multiple ear phones and not satisfied except this TozoT10. I used this to practice my songs with kareoka and gives perfect music . Product Manual is very easy to understand , set up also a just 2 step process . Different size ear buds helps to fit in different ear sizes and it’s shape is perfect fit to sit in the ear and do not feel that it’s dropping .Overall I love this product as of now , Iam using it every day since I purchased .i purchase this product again if required extra pair",5,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"this is my first pair of wireless earbuds, and I did lots of research to finally decide on this one. here are my reasons and review:1-price is acceptable",5,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"These headphones are extremely good, particularly for their price. They come with a handy charging case, several different ear pad sizes, and a charging cord for the case. The default earpads fit my ears perfectly. I took them for a test drive on my most recent trip to the grocery store. I was able to listen to my audiobook without having to constantly adjust the earbud and it made a banal task into something fun. I'd highly recommend these headphones for anybody who wants decent sound at a great price and wants to be able to charge them wirelessly. Battery on the headphones is excellent lasting me for over 4 hours. The case can charge that your buds up three or four times so these are good for long trips or long shifts at work. These are easily one of the easiest recommends I've ever made.",5,1,2019-8-18,1,0,0
"Do not buy these, I have been using them for 10 months. First, the connection is weak, you constantly hear the hopping sound of them trying to connect even long causes disconnection. Then the battery starts to decay very quickly, first they last all day then they'll last half day, then they last only a couple hours, now they don't even charge. They were great compact and don't even feel them but they don't last.",1,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
These earbuds have amazing sound including great clarity and amazing bass and they are very comfortable. These earbuds pair easily with my phone. They charge quickly and they last around 4 to 6 hours of continuous use. For the price I don't think you can find better quality earbuds and I would purchase these again without hesitation. The company is also an A-plus company and if you have any issues with your earbuds the company will be extremely helpful and accommodating.,5,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"Honestly, you can't really go wrong with these wireless earbuds. The sound quality is great for the price, they fit snugly and comfortably (and the earpieces can be changed, so its bound to work with you) and the battery life is excellent. At times I'm forgetting I'm wearing anything and I've even fallen asleep with them without any worries about them being uncomfortable or falling out.I've yet to find any problems with them regarding bluetooth pairing, though I must admit the buttons on them are somewhat mushy and not clicky enough for my taste. Likewise, I think the charging case is a bit bulky and might be uncomfortable to have in a pocket compared to other lightweight cases that are out there.",5,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0
The sound quality is fairly good with nice bass. But that's about the only good thing about these earbuds. The bluetooth connection is very spotty after only about 10 ft and completely gone at about 15ft. The right earbud got very hot during recharge. The earbuds are large and protrude from the ear a long way. They are also uncomfortable in the ear and made my ears sore if inserted far enough to keep them secure. Over all I'd give them a 2 rating.,2,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"I love these earbuds, great price, Great sound quality, I love the case they come in:  however, I must have a small ear hole because they don’t want to go all the way in my ear.  I have tried the smallest ear piece that came with it.  Am I doing something wrong.  They have fell out a couple of times and I feel like I’m talking ina barrel.  Maybe it’s something you have to get use to.  I give it five stars because all of the things it ask above deserve 5 stars.",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
Work ok you only get 4 hour of battery life. The bud is round and dont fit in my ear all that great. I have another set that are oval and are alot better and I get 10 hours of life. They do fully charge in 15 minutes. They would fall out of my ears all the time so I gave them to my wife and she likes them. To each there own I guess.,4,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"So these have taken a dump. Calls aren’t heard. Sounds like I’m in a jet engine. They keep disconnecting. I’ve taken care of these and stored in the case. No reason they should be failing. I’ve hardly used them. Bunk!Unwrap the package and set your phone to pair. Everything else is automatic. No holding down buttons or re searching for device. It’s amazing that either bud can be an independent unit. Essentially use one until the battery dies and then pull the other out of the charger box to continue your phone call. It automatically turns on and pairs. Every time. The sound quality is crisp and the person you are talking to can clearly understand you during the call. Regarding music, sound quality is spectacular. Finally a quality Bluetooth product that is great.",1,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
The beeping sound that goes off every few minutes from the earbud trying to connect to the other earbud when I only pull out one to use by itself goes away after about a minute. Its alot louder than the FocusPower F-10? FocusPower 10. It Definitely has the word Focus Power in it(the one that comes with a single earbud).It's pretty comfortable. Although I've only had it for a few days. Will update later on.,5,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0
"Bought these as a Christmas gift for my son.  They included a variety of sizes of earpieces, which guarantees a good fit.  Sound quality is good, as is the battery life.  No issues with Bluetooth pairing.  The lights on the charging box make it easy to see if the earbuds or the box need charging.  The storage box can be charged via cable or on a charging pad.  I plan to get a pair for myself for the gym.",5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"For my purposes - which are  basically listening to music, ebooks or you tube- these earbuds are great. I'm happy with the sound & battery life. The only problem I have is with the fit.

"I just purchase the TOZO T10 earbuds. They are wonderful!  I was a little skeptical at first buying them because I have found that earplugs/earbuds have a hard time staying in my ears when I am out walking or moving around.  They seem to be a little too big for my ears.  My IPhone earplugs are good sitting but when moving around they too have tendencies’ to fall out of my ears plus they are not wireless.  The TOZO T10 comes with a choice of four different size earbuds to attach. I find that the smallest fit great; they are comfortable and when walking/moving around they stay in.  I do like the distant range I can move away from my device. They have good quality sound, but what I like most is that they talk to you pairing them together, turning on and connecting to your device.",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"This product did exactly what I wanted it to. I bought these with the hope that they would be able to do everything my wired earphones do, but without the wires. It very much satisfies these requirements. The connection didn't cut out as long as I stayed within roughly 8 meters, and I got the full quality of sound that wired earphones give. The battery time wasn't a problem at all, with me being able to keep them in my ears for up to 4 hours without any problems. The water resistance was also a big selling point for me, and I was able to take them into the shower without a problem. If they do end up breaking, the free 1-year warranty eases my mind. The case seems quite sturdy, and I have yet to have a problem with it. They were extremely easy to set up, and I would happily recommend these to a friend.",5,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"The earbuds have good sound quality, the design is somewhat slick, and the charging case is nice looking. That being said, they feel uncomfortable as they are sort of bulky and heavy-ish. They do not offer an option to use them individually without the other. That is, in order to use the left earbud alone, for instance, the other has to be physically out of the charging box. Additionally, once you walk away from the right earbud (if you’re only using the left) the connection goes bad quickly.  Lastly, the left earbud’s sound cuts off continuously.",3,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
These are great sounding BUT they DO NOT stay in your ears. I have tried each size rubber ear plug. None of them work unless I keep my head perfectly still. They are waterproof however. One popped off and fell in toilet. Still works fine. Just annoying that you cannot wear them around without them randomly popping out of ears.,3,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
Omg I absolutely adore these headphones I got the khaki color which is beautiful almost a Champagne rose gold the quality is amazing I definitely get a lot of battery life out of it which is amazing and I've already refer to people to get them because I'm so in-love they include an extra pair of butts to make sure everybody has their own perfect size which I adore not to mention you get several full charges from the case alone which by the way wirelessly charges I'm obsessed beyond words skip the Galaxy buds or airpods and go with these,5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,1

"I bought these earbuds about a year ago and love them (when they work). They're great at canceling out busy street noises when I'm trying to study or focus on a workout. Sadly, about 6 months after my purchase, I noticed my earbuds acting a little funky. Sometimes they would try to sync to my phone when they were in their charging case, and sometimes when I had my phone in my left hand or in my pocket, the sound would cut in and out. It was manageable until recently, when my left earbud would no longer charge in the charging case. I contacted customer service. A representative contacted me back within 24 hours and was very nice, offering me a replacement set of earbuds for the ones that had broken. I'm very glad that I will get to continue to use these earbuds.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0

"I have pretty freakishly small ears, usually any type of earbud that doesn't have those silicone cushion cannot fit in my ear and is painful, but these come with plenty of different sized silicone pieces and do not hurt my ears at all. I saw that they were waterproof and gave them a try in the shower and they work perfectly, the one thing I would change is the touch button on each bud to a regular button, sometimes I accidentally touch it and pause my music and sometimes in the shower the droplets activate it. All in all I would buy these again. These even seem to have more bass than my over the ear solo wireless beats that I was replacing",5,1,2020-9-28,1,0,0
"The earbuds sound quality is good, but the ergonomics are not comfortable. The push button adjustment is awkward due to the angle that the phones rest in the ear.Update. I initiated a return.

"After an unfortunate incident with our washing machine, I had to replace my beloved Bose ear buds. I was apprehensive at first, but decided to go with the TOZO T10 wireless waterproof Bluetooth earbuds. They are easy to pair with your device, sound quality is second to none with a range of crisp clear highs and mids and real clean deep bass you just don’t find in many other earbuds. In my experience, you get in the ballpark of 4-5 hours battery life. The case is also your wireless charging station with its own internal battery. It can be plugged in via a standard micro usb charging cable or just sit it your wireless charger. These earbuds are a homer in in my books and if anything were ever happen to them, I would not hesitate to purchase another set!",5,1,2019-7-4,1,0,0

"I would not buy these again. They simply do not stay in the ears. They will only sit snug if the user is completely motionless, and even then they need constant readjustment. Repeat: DO NOT BUY if you are a human whose body moves, exercises, sweats, or walks around a lot. Anything with an ear strap would be better. Probably the most annoying earbuds I've ever used.",1,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"I needed wireless earbuds because I do a lot of driving for work but need to answer calls throughout. Unfortunately, my car is rather simple and doesn't have a bluetooth system. I bought an FM transmitter in hopes it would take care of all the problems, but that didn't go well, and I returned it. When these earbuds came in, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to connect them to my phone and then to set up the charging units. So far, they've been wonderful! Music comes in strong, the pushing of buttons is simple, and they don't fall out even when I'm shaking my head intensely for... no reason.I only have two areas of concern: 1) even with Spotify tracks, there's a bit of fuzziness in the background, and 2) using the smallest earbud covers, the earbuds end up being a tiiiiiny bit too big for my ears (but then again, maybe I'm the only person in the world with this problem, sigh).",4,1,2019-9-8,1,0,0
"Case is a bit large but for the battery life you get, its fine, pairing process was simple, only 1 of the earbuds need to be paired at once, either the left or right and the other will connect as wellVery bassy, but overall sound quality is decent, not as good as galaxy buds, but for less than half the price, its totally acceptable",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"I lost my Jaybird X4s so I went out on a limb with these as they are pretty cheap. Lots of positive reviews convinced me they’d be worth trying. I really liked the case these came in and the packaging seemed high quality. I tried all of the earbud sizes included and just could not get these to stay in my ear. Even then, it wouldn’t matter as I would be returning these regardless. The south quality is just straight up awful. Maybe I’ve been spoiled by my Sony WH-1000MX2s, but don’t believe any of the reviews saying the sound quality is “perfect”. Mids are watery sounding, highs are tiny and unpronounced. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money for a way better product. I’m returning these for some Jaybirds or Sennheisers.",2,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
"I bought these as a cheaper alternative to my expensive Samsung Galaxy buds when doing dirty outdoor yard work.  I quickly found that the sound quality was better than my Samsung buds when doing things with a lot of background noise, such as mowing the lawn.  The bass and midrange comes through with a lot more clarity in noisy environments.Customer service was very responsive when I needed to contact them.",5,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0
"Great sound. My only issue is that they loosen which causes a huge reduction in base and overall quality in sound. A lot of the times they just fall out of my ear. I have tried every size option, and twisting method as directed my the manual to no avail. Great sound but useless if they don't stay in my ear.Update: Purchasing these ears buds allows the TOZO to stay in my ear, bumping to 4 stars. Forgot to mention, it is not good for calls, just music. Below is the link for where i bought the buds. The Thimble type worked the best for me.",4,1,2019-9-8,1,1,0
"I bought these under my wife's account, so I can't show up here as a verified purchaser, but rest assured, I bought these headphones here on Amazon last week, and have been using them for about 7 days now.About a year ago, I bought a pair of Zolo Liberty wireless earbuds for over twice the price of these, and had nothing but problems. The earpieces would often fall out of sync, and would lose connection with the phone in my pocket. These are much better, plus waterproof, and I greatly enjoy the fact that I can drop them on my wireless charging pads and come back to full batteries. The sound still cuts out every once in a while, but it very quickly improves, and I am not bothered by it when I'm listening to music or podcasts walking around in crowded areas. The sound quality and comfort of these earbuds is at least as good as that more expensive pair, but I lost those for a direct comparison.",5,1,2019-2-28,1,0,1
I used these headphones almost every day and enjoy them a lot! Until the battery life started going down after 8 months and the headphones stopped charging. Not sure if it was the case or the actual headphones but I decided to pick up another because they are a good value for the price (make sure you get the warranty so you dont end up like me),3,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"I LOVE these headphones!! I’ve been a little hesitant on buying wireless earbuds since my ears are VERY small. But, these are perfect. They’re easy to use, compact fit in my pocket or purse and charge very quickly. I will definitely  be ordering some for my friends and family. Not to mention, they’re waterproof & come with a cute wristlet cord.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,1
It's not often you get value for your money these days and I was very skeptical about buying earbuds off Amazon but I got to tell you people at work are like okay dude we get it there great headphones I mean I'm serious I'm promoting these things all the time you think I'd work for the company but I don't definitely definitely awesome headphones the bass the treble the mids so good I mean just so good,5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"First once I charged them up and took them out of their case they instantly paired with each other. Then once I paired these earbuds to my phone,  I am still amazed how fast these ear buds connect to my phone , so fast before I can even get it in my ear they are connected.  They have good sound quality and the microphone works good also. Overall I would recommend them.  Good earbuds at a good price.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
Worked ok when standing still. When walking around bluetooth signal faded in and out.

"The Tozo T10 Stereo Earbuds seem to be a fine quality product. Comes with a nice charging case, charging wire, case lanyard and various ear adapters. Pairing was easy as removing them from case and selecting T10 from Bluetooth list on device. Sound quality is good and made better with equalizer controls. Expect these to hold up well.",4,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
I bought these back in March and they worked well for a while. They were easy to pair to my phone. They did sometimes drop the music from my phone but it came right back. But now they won't pair with each other. I can pair one individually with my phone but they will not work together any more. I've reset them several times and made the phone forget them but I can only get sound out of the right earbud now.,1,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"Absolutely fantastic.  I bought these only for the IPX8 rating, but have been surprised at every turn. Sound quality is amazing. Noise cancellations awe inspiring. I wore these to a Brother Moses concert and it brought the noise levels down so my hearing was not fatigued from the concert speakers. They also allowed me to enjoy the music while making conversation with my friends around me do-able. I am excessively happy with my purchase.",5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"For the price, you cannot beat these earbuds. Very good sound quality. I use them all the time. Battery life is very good. Much better than I expected at this price point.  I highly recommend them.Update:  After reading some of the other reviews, I want to clarify mine. I only use these when I sit in the garage to enjoy a cigar. I don't know how they work for exercise or any activity when you are moving. If you block the right earbud, the left one will cut out. Not an issue for me. I usually listen to jazz with them. The sound quality is pretty good at the price you pay. You want $300 quality, then buy a $300 set of earbuds. For what I use them for, I am very happy with the purchase.",5,1,2019-4-25,1,0,0
Good value for the price.  Sound quality is excellent.  Good for just listening or work outs.  For running I found these a little uncomfortable and the left ear piece skipped quite a bit.  I prefer my Jaybird J4 for running as they are lighter and have a longer battery life.  However I am satisfied with the purchase.,5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"I ordered three well reviewed bluetooth headphones in a similar price range and tried all. These were the best in sound quality and noise cancellation. UNFORTUNATELY, they are missing one obvious and important feature -- SKIPPING to the next song. They added answer call, end call and even call back the last number! and pause/ play music but no way to skip to the next song which is so disappointing. If I am swimming or at the gym, I really need that feature!!!",4,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"I had such high hopes for these! I have been looking for earbuds that I can use in the shower & during exercise. For these reasons I was looking for a pair that fits well without falling out all the time. Based on the reviews I went with these ones and I also loved the fact that this came with multiple size caps. For whatever reason I just can't get them to stay in my ears!! I tried all caps but they still fell out eventually. It's a great quality device for the price, however I can't use it for what I wanted to :(",3,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"These are comfortable, great-sounding earbuds for a very reasonable price. I have ears that seem to be hard to fit with earbuds, but these fit quite firmly and comfortably.

I had a little difficulty connecting them to my IPod but after reading the instructions and trying again I was successful.  I ordered on a Tuesday and received on Wednesday.  Been using them every since I received them.  The charging box is great!  If they would come in the color ""red"" I would definitely order a second pair.",5,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0
"Have used them at the gym a few times now and they worked perfect. They did not slip after putting in the right sleeve (multiple sleeves came with package, find your best fit). Great noise cancelling feature,  I was in my own world. Clean sound with GREAT voice activation for calls. I have tried two other brands, one less expensive and one more expensive,  these are far superior.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"I previously posted that my left ear bud had stopped pairing with the right after a couple weeks of use. Tozo was very responsive to the complaint, immediately responded, and asked how the could remedy the situation. They shipped a new set immediately, which seem to be working fine thus far. (The replacementmodel is T6). These earbuds have good features at an affordable price. I like the size, sound, and weight of both models of earbuds. They both held a charge, are portable, and pair instantly with my phone (Samsung S9+).  If any defects persist I will update this review. Otherwise, I recommend Tozo earbuds for their features and price.",5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"These earbuds work great, amazing sound quality and battery lasts a fair amount of time, I'm always using them, I've had my pair for 3 months now and they've been great up until now, suddenly the right earbud, which is the one I use most, has stopped working, it won't turn on or charge, it wasn't wet or anything like that when it stopped and I can't get it to work again...",3,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
"UPDATE:They worked great for a few weeks - now they won’t stay connected to my phone, laptop or my husbands phone. I can’t get in touch with anyone for assistance so I cant say if it’s an isolated issue.

Love the Bass, easy to use out of the box, easy bluetooth connection, no issue connecting to all my devices - surface pro PC, Mac Pro, ipad, samsung notes 8. The cover for the base charger snaps in place as it is magnetic and the the ear piece slots for charging inside the base is also magnetic and snaps into place is a great feature.

"I ordered this TOZO T10 for my daughter who seems to lose any and all wireless earbuds.  The price for value ratio is super solid and if she misplaces them (as sooo many times before) I will not freak out!  The sound seems to be as good as a very similar pair I own from a few years ago, again great value!  Seems to cancel noise well, wish I could easly get on a plane to really test them out, but with this stupid virus, that will have to wait!  Daughter really likes the coral/pinkish color, great to not be forced to buy another black or white pair!  Black seems to get lost fast as flies to a..., well, you know!",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,1

Great sound quality and very comfortable in my ears.  I am very impressed with how nice these earbuds work.  They paired right away and the range is pretty good.  I can't say enough about the comfort and music quality.  I own Air Pods and I prefer to listen to music on the TOZO's.  You don't have to spend a ton of money on some good earbuds.  Try the TOZO's I think you'll like them.,5,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0

"Initially when I opened these and put them on I was amazed. The sound quality is fantastic they are very comfortable, and they worked great for phone conversations. Now I'm three days in and the sound quality is still there but they randomly disconnect mid phone call. The weird part is my phone still recognized them they were still powered on and my phone showed I was using Bluetooth in the call but I couldn't hear anyone talking unless I switched to my phones native speakerphone or handset talking. The Bluetooth would just give me dead air. The left one also disconnects at random where I'll be listening to music and the sound will just drop out. Initially this was going to be a five star review but after a few days and having these problems the only reason it didn't get a one star was because they actually sound fantastic, just when they work though.",2,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"It falls out very easily if you have medium sized ears. I have tried all of the different sized ear things that came with the headphones and they didn't solve the problem. I bought these to work out in and they didn't do a great job for that, one jump and they would fall out because of the way the weight is distributed in the product. Because the outside and the body of the buds are so heavy, they fall out of your ears super quickly. Not worth the time and the money to buy and then return it because it serves no purpose.",1,1,2019-7-7,1,0,0
"I got these earbuds and originally had no problem using them. Then when I had put them back in the case to charge and took them out to use them again, they were magically unpaired from one another. I followed the reset instructions which says to hold down both earbuds until they flash purple, but I couldn't get them both to flash purple at the same time. For some reason, the left one didn't want to reset. I tried troubleshooting and resetting multiple times, but it took a few days before I was able to fully use them again. I tried it again today and it worked, but I'm afraid of them unpairing from one another again. I otherwise really like this product, but I rated 4 stars for the troubling pairing issues.",4,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0
"The Tozo T10 wireless earbuds are an excellent budget earbuds. They have terrific sound and bass quality. The also come in a nice slim charging case that is sleek and easily fits in a pocket. The charge time is pretty good, I have about 4-5 hours in earbud time. They are said to be waterproof, but I have not had a chance to test that yet. On my runs they stay firmly in my ears and sweat doesn't make them move around. The one negative I am upset about is the call quality. I read other reviews on this product that the call quality is pretty good both for caller and receiver. I may have a defective pair but the receiver says I sound alien like. My voice is distorted. I tried this 5 times with different phones and people- same result. Since they are also budget earbuds you do not have as much touch control with the earbuds themselves. 1 click- play/ pause. 2 click- redial last number. I haven't seen anywhere I can change this.",4,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"Product gets the job done, but has a couple flaws I wouldn't expect in a $50 product.1. Microphone is super quiet; no one can hear me well when I use it, so it's basically useless.",4,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
"I have only had the chance to use these earbuds for two days, but so far they have been absolutely wonderful. The sound quality is awesome and it was extremely easy to pair to my phone. I have not had the chance to test out how well the battery life is but I like how the case charges the buds between uses. The only unfortunate thing is that the earbuds cannot control volume and/or change the song. In the scheme of things this isn't a huge deal for me. All in all I am extremely happy with the earbuds and would definitely recommend them-especially for the price.",4,1,2019-6-22,1,0,0
"These are great sounding BT ear buds with excellent base...  Until the left ear bud stops working.  Happened twice after exchanging the first set for the same reason.

"I purchased this product as an alternative to the more expensive Apple Air Pods.  I had tried several “generic” AirPods and had frequent sound quality issues, range issues, etc.  I also liked the fact that these earbuds are waterproof—though I have not had the opportunity to use them while swimming yet.  THe sound quality, charging case (which also charges wirelessly on any wireless charging mat) and earphone are excellent.  I did have a rare problem with the left earbud battery failure, but customer service was prompt and eager to solve the issue.  They come with a one year no-hassle warranty and they mean what they say.  I appreciate all the help and enjoy using these earbuds.  I recommend highly recommend the product.  I did mark down noise cancellation to 4 stars, but earbuds inherently do not have the same ability to noise cancel as over-the-ear headphones.  I have three young children, so noise cancellation can be a huge feature when I am trying to work from home.",5,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0

"These came up as a best all around seller on Amazon. I want good quality, but I’m not that picky, I use them to listen to audiobooks and podcasts, or while gardening.

I did not like these headphones at all. They keep glitching. The button to push to pause/turn off is really hard to press and has redialed to call people when I was trying to just turn it off. It's clunky and cheap material. I would say spend an extra 50 or whatever and get something better. These are a waste of money and definitely not worth 50 bucks. I would say the sound quality is worse then a pair of 15 dollar wired headphones.,1,1,2019-8-25,1,0,0
"Great fit and fairly comfortable.  I say fairly as the do get a touch uncomfortable after wearing them for a couple hours (this is in the outer ear only, not in the ear canal...  that never got uncomfortable).

I wish they would incorporate the contacts so that you abe better able to screen your calls",4,1,2019-5-28,1,0,0
I still want to dish out the cash for some AirPods in the future but these have been a great introduction into wireless headphones. The battery lasts long enough to not be annoying and their waterproof capabilities makes it easy to work out without anxiety of damaging them. If I had any issue it’s that they’re a little bulky and the blue light that occasionally flashes can be distracting but I don’t think that makes them worth any less considering the reasonable price tag.,5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones after I thought I lost my Jabra pair after seeing it was rated pretty high by host reviewers and I can say after a little more then a week (in that time I’ve used them almost constantly between having to charge, sleep, and socializing).I can say that they function well and beyond my expectations of headphones in their price range I will definitely be recommending them.",5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"I’ve been looking for a decent pair of earbuds for a decent price for several months. A few days ago, I just happened to come across these bad boys on Amazon and then spent a long time on YouTube checking out the reviews. The positive reviews far outweighed any negative comments. As we all know, you can’t please all the people all the time. I finally decided to “pull the trigger” and placed my order with Amazon.I just received my new TOZO T10 earbuds. The pairing process with my iPhone was a seamless non-event. The enclosed instructions were a little lacking but my countless YouTube searches paid off. These are the first earbuds I have ever used and I totally love them. The fit in the ear canal with the “medium” ear cap is just right for me.

Not a bad set of Bluetooth headphones. They don't hold a charge all day but will for a few hours. Easy to use and sync. They do cancel out noise quiet well. I can't hear people talking to me.

"These little suckers pack a decent punch, especially for the price.  I was pleasantly surprised, even after I read all the positive reviews.  Very discreet and stylish.  Stays firmly in while I run.  Solid battery life for the size.  Considering it's about 1/5 of the price of the brand that shall not be named, this is well worth it to be non-conforming.  Do I wish the cradle were a little bit smaller and pocket-friendly?  Yes.  But it's definitely not a deal-breaker since it gives me 4 full charges.  I highly recommend.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0

"Initially, I was not happy with the TOZO ear buds. Using the supplied tips, they would not stay in my ears at all. Eventually, I found a set of tips in the back of a drawer and tried the smallest size and the ear buds seem to stay put...as they should.  Unfortunately, the extra tips that come with this product did not provide a ear gel/tip option that worked for me. Sound quality is ok. I have other wireless ear buds with much better sound depth but these are not bad, not great but ok.

"These headphones are a good quality for the price.  They are easy to operate and fit comfortably.  While I haven’t had them long enough to really give a full review of the product features, I just had to give 5stars for customer service alone.

Turns out that I had to put my phone in my right side pocket to get it to work, which is not that big of a deal but still disappointing. It claims to have range of 10 meters but it can't handle a left side, seems very strange. I do have a Samsung 8 so maybe it's just a specific issue with that. Otherwise it's everything that it claims.",4,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"These are my first wireless earbuds and I couldn't be happier with them. I like the audio. With one full charge, it can go for 4 hours straight. They are easy to operate. I wish it could support Bluetooth multipoint so that I don't have to completely disconnect from one device to connect to a new one, but I think for the product's price it supports the best features there are to offer. The charging case is sleek and compact. With a full charge, the charging case can charge the earbuds for about four times without needing any extra charging. I got this product during a sale and I have been very pleased with it.",5,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"For 1/6 of the price of a premium brand wireless earbuds, you’d definitely get the bang for your buck with this one! The bass really is deep and good for mobile gaming. Satisfied with battery life and if you lose these by accident, it doesn’t punch your wallet in the gut as it would if you lost the other top tier brands. Watch me unbox this.

"These earbuds sound amazing and when one quit working, all I had to do was contact TOZO and they were on the ball to make it right. All I asked them to do was to please replace my non-working ear bud (one single earbud). They could have done that and I would have been happy. They did that and SO MUCH MORE, ABOVE AND BEYOND GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! They sent me a WHOLE NEW SET of earbuds, two earbuds, and case, and even covered the shipping! That is what I call AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE on top of an amazing product! I WILL USE TOZO again! Thanks so much for being such a stand up company. Other companies could learn a thing or two from you!",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of these headphones, given the price.  My only complaint is that when connecting to my laptop, apps such as Discord and Zoom have issues keeping the connection to the headphones.  Even watching a video, the headphones come in and out.  I don't have this problem on my iPhone or any other mobile device I've used the headphones one.  It's entirely possible that the difficultly is something on my computer settings.  Nonetheless, it's a solid purchase.",4,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"The sound quality exceeded my expectations. The bass was nice and clean with a good mixture of mids and highs. The case/charger felt solid with a magnetically closing lid.  The buds themselves were quick to charge and I had no issue connecting the ear buds to my computer via Bluetooth. Please note, the right connects to your device and the left bud connects to the right bud. You can use the right bud without the left, you can not use the left without the right.I did find the ear buds to be a bit uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time (15+ minutes), even after trying the various sizes of ear pads that came the unit. This is probably a personal preference as other may find them comfortable. This is the only reason I'll be returning the ear buds.",4,1,2019-1-22,1,0,0
"Amazing headphones at a great price, I quit buying earbuds a while back and switched to over ear because nothing stayed in my ear right or didn't sound good. These solved the problem, they can with multiple earbuds sizes. They sound really good.

Bought these as a Christmas gift for my wife who had said previously that site did not think she would like Bluetooth earbuds. I got them because she loves to listen to Christian music while working out on the Nordic track butt she is always complaining about the wires from her headphones being in the way. After using these earbuds once she was hooked and I don't believe will ever use anything else. She loves them!,5,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
"After going through a number of wireless headphones, and hating all of them, I was pleasantly surprised when I went for my first run with these. The right one popped out on me during a jog but I believe that was due to heavy perspiration. I think a bit of silicone or rubber around the edge that sits in the shell of your ear would help keep this from happening. The sound qualities decent but a bit loud even on level one because of how far down it sits in the canal. But overall this product is great. The charging system is compact and handy. I also love that these are waterproofed. Finally, the price tag can't be beat.",4,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0
"I bought these for working out. The first set I received had a faulty right earbud, battery only lasted about 25-30 minutes. I contacted customer service, within a couple of days, I had a new set delivered to me. Been using them for over a month now. After finding the right size for my ears, I have had zero issues. Good battery life (longest I have used them continuously has been about 1-1/2 hours, but I am sure they will last longer), good sound quality and no issues of disconnecting from source. Overall, good buy for the price.",5,1,2019-11-28,1,1,0
"Quick to charge, charge lasts a long time, audio quality is ok. It will pair well with my Android phone (OnePlus 6). But pretty much nothing else will want to pair with them. I did get my Nvidia Shield (Android TV) to pair one time, but not since. Since I was going to use them with my Nvidia Shield, or TV or even Soundbar, and none of the will pair...this is a FAIL.",2,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"My original order was lost in the mail. After reaching out to Amazon customer service I had another one sent to me right away. Once received, it was easy to connect to both phone and laptop and the sound quality was great. Unfortunately after a few days while running the right ear bud fell to the ground and never turned back on. This time I reached out to Tozo directly and they were willing to send me another set. I don't like that that the ear bud stopped working after falling once but I'm giving it 4 stars for the customer service. Once I receive the new one I'll revisit giving it 5 stars.",4,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"Happy to finally find true wireless headphones that fit my ears. A little bulky with what sticks out, but not as annoying as the little white “stalks” that AirPods have protruding, especially when they’re constantly falling out of my ears. Sound quality is good, especially the bass. Noise cancellation as good as you can expect for the price. These aren’t Bose over-the-ears. I haven’t really worn them out of the house yet, but it does well while I’m exercising and listening to music in the same room that my wife is watching TV. Overall, definite quality for the money. Use your brain - as I’m sure any random pair sent out could have a problem, be smart and sign up for the 18 month warranty.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
"Overall materials, design and functionality are very good. Instructions are thorough and complete. I am having some issues with keeping the earbuds in my ear.

Will keep trying and update this review once I have spent more time with them.",4,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"They come with a case that holds them magnetically in place, charges them and lights up when charging. Which is great. Wasn’t aware I could pick a different color but oh well. I’m stuck with the ugly color.

I guess I wasted my money...",4,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0

I was looking for wireless headphones that wouldn’t cost me an arm or a leg to get. I’m so happy I came across these pair of headphones! I did my research of course because I wanted to make sure they were top notch for the price and they really are. I’ve had these for a couple of days now and the sound quality is amazing! The battery life has lasted me a couple of days now going on my way to work which is a two hour commute. I defiantly would recommend the Tozo T10 to anyone looking for great quality headphones for the right price.,5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0
I love these little guys! I ordered the navy and they are almost black but that's not an issue for me. I love that there are 4 ear bud sizes. Most are way too big for my ears so i like having smaller options. The case is magnetic which is really nice and they look and feel like quality materials. Overall i have ZERO complaints. The amount of bass was surprisingly great!,5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,1
"These are incredible earbuds, well worth $80.00, and only cost $40...can’t beat that. Sound is very nice, so easy to put on and connect to Bluetooth.

I am not one to write reviews, however in this case I would be remiss if I didn’t give it 5 stars",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
I was looking for an alternative to Airpods. I will not spend $150  on earbuds or on a product that doesn't even fit in my ear properly. A friend of mine who is an audio engineer recommended these. They are nicely priced. They have the ear cushions so they don't hurt my ear and they don't feel like they will fall out.  I highly recommend these.,5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"These are great. I love how lightweight they are. I don't like wearing headphone hook over my ear because I have to wear glasses, which makes my primary headphone uncomfortable to wear. These are a good alternative if you don't want to wear contacts to the gym all the time. Pairing is simple and the earbuds have a nice sound quality. The case for the earbuds doubles as an external battery that can recharge the earbuds up to fours times. Well worth $50. Get rid of your Bose and Beats. Downsize to these.",5,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
"These earbuds are pretty solid for the money. After charging them and linking them up they were fine and then after about an hr or so the left earbud started disconnecting for some reason even after following the instructions and rebooting them.

"The sounds is pretty good. However I am disappointed with Bluetooth range it says 10 meters. How come? With Bluetooth 5.0, devices can use data transfer speeds of up to 2 Mbps devices can also communicate over distances of up to 800 feet (or 240 meters). Battery life average 14h.  I have other $20 QCY earbuds with them I can walk around the house with no interruptions and battery life also higher 20h. Will be returning.",2,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"Although this isn't top-of-the-line like other high end wireless earbuds (which I remind you are around $130), they still have amazing performance for their price. They have amazing noise cancellation, even blocking pretty much all the sound from my vacuum while cleaning the house. The sound quality is also very good, matching quality you'd get from higher-ish end earbuds. The only issue I had is with the battery life of the buds themselves. Although, it is a pleasant surprise that the battery actually lasts LONGER than what they advertise it to be. However, it is amazing for the price point. If you're looking to buy budget earbuds that actually are high quality, this is for you.",4,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"9/2/2020 Updated review: I've had these since June and yeah they were great but now they die after only 3 hours of usage. Save your money and buy something else. What a disappointment.An update, the buds they provide hurt your ear and I had to buy new buds to go over where they insert into the ear. They are also loud...a little too loud and it's annoying but they last long and that's appreciated..... Color me impressed I honestly was not expecting amazing quality but I was so pleasently surprised! The case is durable and they give you everything you you need!",1,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"Great wireless headphone. I bought the white for me & black for my boyfriend. First pair of wireless headphones for both of us. We both love these; great sound and easy to use.

"I purchased these ear buds just a few days ago and they came straight away. Connected them to my phone, which was incredibly easy, and proceeded to listen to talk information. I was impressed by the clarity and noise canceling of the units. I honestly have a hard time hearing anything outside of the sound coming from the speakers. This morning I decided to listen to music (heavy metal), and was once again VERY pleased with the quality of the product. The full range of dynamic sound is actually way better than I was prepared for at the price of them.If I did have one complaint, it would be that they could go louder. Personal preference of course as I like my music to BLAST my ears when I am in the zone! :)",5,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
I was wanting so bad to love these but they just would not stay connected to each other or the phone. I returned them as a result of one continuously cutting out on more than one occasion.The IP rating is what drew me to them and the sound was actually not bad I just couldn't continue to have my left side keep disconnecting.,3,1,2019-8-22,1,0,0
"My review of products typically consist of a single word: bad, good, OK, satisfactory, great, etc.  For the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds a single word is not sufficient.  A group of friends and I travel on our motorcycles.  The Honda Goldwing has on board sound but when wearing a helmet I have to use a wired set up.  The wired sound is OK until getting or turning off the bike. When the bike is off so is the sound. The T10’s make it possible to Bluetooth through my iPhone, wear the earbuds with my helmet on or off and exit the bike with no interruption of music/sound.  The T10’s sound quality is crisp and clean unlike other earbuds I’ve tried.  The pairing is SUPER easy, they fit securely in my ears, the sound quality is exceptional, comes with a charging case and all for less than $50. I am exceptionally happy and pleased with this purchase!!!",5,1,2019-5-10,1,0,1
"I'm loving this headset.  I replaced the amazon echo buds with this headset.  The echo buds would not stay connected no matter what and this rendered them useless.  This headset is less than half the cost and simply works as advertised.  The quality of the headset is amazing, volume is perfect, and the noise cancellation is an unexpected benefit.  I'd highly recommend this product!",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"Last year I purchased this same product but the generation before (cant remember what they are called, but the ones before the T10) and they absolutely sucked. Wouldn't pair to my phone after just a few days of use and the sound quality was nothing impressive. I was very weary about giving this company a second chance, but boy have they redeemed themselves. These are the best pair of wireless headphones i've ever used. Perfect for working out. They never fall out, sound is good, and the charging system received a MASSIVE update. WOW! Everything is magnetic on the charging case rather than spring loaded so its super satisfying to pop open the case and shut it. Not only that, but the actual headphones are held snugly in their charging ports via magnets. All you have to do is hover the headphones above their little slot in the case and they pop right into place effortlessly. I am very impressed with the quality of these headphones and I am very glad I decided to give this company another chance.",4,1,2019-9-18,1,0,0
I like that the battery seems to last so long and that I can wear just one while I charge the other. Many others I looked at required I wear both for them to pair.I liked these so much that I got my son a set for Christmas. BUT now I am changing my 5 stars to 1,1,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"Just received these today, the case is durable and easy to use. It secures the earbuds and I would never worry about the case opening and losing either of the ear buds.

So far, super happy with them.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"My work friends and I all got a pair for ourselves the same week, 1 got the real deal ($$$$$) another got the WISH version ($) and I got these! Everyone hates there’s but MINE ARE PERFECTION.

Definitely the perfect quarantine buy at a fantastic price.",5,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0

"I decided to go cordless with my earbuds and saw the Tozo T10 as a highly rated and recommended product on Amazon. I did not want to spend the $150+ for the top tier earphones on the market so decided to settle on a pair of Tozo T10's. After using the product for a couple days, I can say that I do not regret the purchase. Going cordless has been a true game changer and these earbuds did not disappoint. The earbuds connect very easily with my laptop and phone and the sound quality is quite good. I have not tested its water resistant as I do not use these in the shower or go swimming often but I will trust the product's description and believe that it is in fact water resistant. The case that holds the earbuds is magnetic and the earbuds snap into place when putting them in the case. The charging port for the case is traditional USB type A but that isn't a big deal at all. Overall, the product is worth it for its price and I hope these last me a while.",5,1,2019-8-27,1,0,0
I was hesitant to switch to wireless earbuds due to battery life and wireless technology in general. I've had no connection issues and I've yet to run out of batteries in a day. Having the case handy to store them in and charge them at the same time is while not in use is awesome. Overall I am very happy to be rid of wires that get caught on things and pull the earbuds out. The bass is great and I won't be going back to wires after these!,5,1,2019-9-8,1,0,0
"For anyone with sensitive ears, these may not be the best due to the very loud and strong sound it gives. It is awesome!!! I literally can have my sound turned up on my iPhone 1 notch and it is loud enough. I couldn't imagine these on iPhone volume all the way up!!! If you want great sounds, EXTREMELY loud, and can not hear anyone talking (or yelling) at you then I recommend!

I scoured the eleventy billion Q&A on the product page and nothing seemed to actually address the issue until I found the answer deep in the bowels of all the questions.For one earpiece use without the constant beeping you have to start by taking BOTH ear pieces out out of the case, let them pair with each other, let them pair with the device - THEN - after those steps are done you can put one of the earpieces back into the case and while you'll hear a disconnect notice and another annoying beep that's it!  No more constant beeps and the remaining earpiece will still be connected to the device.",4,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0

They are also very comfortable and a lot more balanced than I thought they'd be.The sound quality is way better than I expected and they absolutely blow away my old fitness wired earbuds, wow!

"Overall, these headphones are great. I’ve been looking for a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones for while now and I stumbled across these on Amazon and I’m very happy I bought them!Sound quality is great! Love the bass, as I listen to a lot of hip-hop/rap and edm when I’m working out (which is when I mainly use these). They have a lot of sound power to them and can very loud, so I keep them at maybe 30-40% volume AT MOST and that’s perfect!

"I have been looking for a great wireless pair of headphones for a long time now. These popped up in my last search around my price range and I couldn't help but notice the 9,000+ positive reviews on them. Since I have had them I have worn them every day and used them for something. The sound is great, charging case is convenient and lasts long, and the microphone works on phone calls phenomenally. What's even better is the customer service. When you open the box there is a sheet of paper with instructions on claiming the FREE one year warranty (Make sure you do this right away it takes literally 1 minute to set up). After about a week of having them I dropped the case in the gym and it broke, but once I reached out to the customer service they were more than happy to send me another charging case immediately!

"I rec'd my earbuds a couple of weeks ago and have basically used them non stop since I got them. They came completely charged out of the box. Pairing was a breeze & I've been getting nearly 3hrs per charge. The sound quality has been excellent, whether for podcasts, audio books or music. It takes roughly a hour to charge them and you get 4 charges before you have to charge the entire unit. While I've not gone swimming with them, they do hold up well in with sweat & water. I tried them in the shower and they were excellent in there as well. I do have the occasional issue with only one pairing instead of both, but a quick reset does the trick. The only con I can think of is I can't get more than 10-feet from my phone before they lose signal, but that's easily remedied by not getting too far away. 100% would buy them again & the price point of $50 is a great deal.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0

"I use these most everywhere.. As a normal earbud, they are fine. Nothing bad, not great. A bit pricey for not much low end. I notice the lack of performance in the gym and on my motorcycle. They fall out easily in the gym and the speaker 'shorts' or crackles when when sweating, and eventually stops working after about 15 minutes. This is with trying all of the different sized, silicon 'buds' to get the best fit. On the motorcycle, wearing a helmet, they work fine for music and I can even make calls. Noise cancelling does not work well, though. For the $49.99, I would expect a more robust, better performing product. Battery life is intermittent from 2-4 hrs. Not as much as expected or advertised.UPDATE:  Seller has contact me and said I may have defective product. Offered to replace. Nice move.

I cannot say enough good things about these. I love how long the battery lasts for. I get at least a few days between charges. They look better than airpods at less than half the cost. They connect very easily and I love them! If i had one complaint I would say do not wear them in the shower or water. they say waterproof but as soon as your ear gets wet they are falling out. Otherwise 10/10 would buy again,5,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0

These sound quite tinny. They do work and they were delivered quickly. But the sound is fairly poor and they momentarily lose the link to one or both ears if you make sudden movement. I read on some reviews that they will continue to work from 30m which is absolutely false (using iphone 8). I did not return them as they were not so expensive that it is worth the effort but they are not a very good buy and definitely not worth of the 5 star reviews which people are giving them. These reviews are almost certainly false if my example is indicative.,2,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"After a couple of months these earbuds would only play music out of one earbud at a time. It was impossible to get them both to play simultaneously. They began showing up as two separate bluetooth devices. Obviously, it's only possible to connect to one bluetooth device at a time. Look elsewhere.",1,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"These are the absolute worst wireless earbuds I’ve ever used. First, the sound quality is not good. Also, with any head movement (i.e. side-to-side) the reception cuts in and out, which makes using them while running or working out irritating. Second, the battery life is pathetic. I’m a marathon runner and I can’t get halfway through a long run before the battery dies- honestly, 2-3 hours, max. Also, just a nit-picky design criticism: for the last 10-15 mins of battery life, there’s a beep followed by robotic voice that plays on loop over and over. It’s entirely unnecessary, once is enough. Third, the buds pop out of my ears way too easily. I’ve tried three different sized pads, but none of them stay in easily or feel secured.Terrible product- do not buy.",1,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"So for the price and what they are, I really like them. If you want to use one at a time though, it beeps in your ear for a good minute to two before it stops trying to connect the second earbud. The battery lasts okay but I have to constantly keep the container plugged in. However I do use them almost every day so they do really well. For casual listeners, battery life would probably be fine. They do slowly migrate from my ear the longer I listen but I have smaller ears",3,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"Great ear buds for the price.  The sound quality is great with clear highs and good bass tones.  The pairing procedure has been easy with all of my devices.  The wireless charging is also a great feature.  The buds feel very comfortable and secure in my ears and the extra ear buds provided help to create a comfortable fit.  I love these so much I will probably get a second pair.  Battery life is about 3 hours continuous use , however having the rechargeable case is convenient to restore the charge.",5,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0

"I've been eyeing the top brand name headphones for a while but I can't justify the money on such a trivial part of my life.  A friend recommended these to me.  After reading through the reviews I went for it.Good purchase.  You get way more than the asking price for a pair of wireless headphones.  Great pairing, good sound (I've had other top name wireless running headphones that cost a lot more and had worse sound) and they just feel right.  I can't believe that you can get quality (only had them for a day, so going off first impressions) for only $30.  They stay in my ears and the silicon cups stay sealed so far in my ears to reduce outside noise.",5,1,2020-10-3,1,0,0
"Great earbuds for a reasonable price. Comfortable in the ears, last a good amount of time and charge pretty fast in the case. It should be noted that if you leave the case lying around that it may lose charge so be sure to charge your case from time to time (indicated by number of lights on the case - lower number means needs to charge). Comes with a strap to you wear it on your wrist or around your neck to keep the case close. I use it primarily for workouts at the gym while connected to Amazon music or Spotify. They connect seemlessly to the Bluetooth once you take them out of the case. Basically, if you want a budget friendly earbud compared to the AirPods this is a very solid pick.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0

It has very good balanced sound on music. A little light on the bass but very clean and crisp with good noise reduction. While talking on the phone a few friends said it sounded like I had a cold or something.They fit comfortably in my ear with several cushion options. Unsure on the battery life as I just got them.,4,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"I bought these because of the reviews and am really disappointed. The sound is of lesser quality than the free corded iPhone headphones that come with your phone. Sound for music isn't horribly disappointing but the hands free phone function is absolutely worthless. I can still hear a lot of the noise around me but that doesn't bother me personally. I had thought I read good points about battery life but out of the gate I think the longest they have lasted is 2-3 hours at best without a charge in the little case. I have had these for a week and already have the left earphone not connecting to Bluetooth.I would suggest looking around. Maybe I just got a bad set, I do not know. I will likely be requesting a refund.",2,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
My daughter purchased these first and I love the sound quality these buds gave while I was speaking with her.  She gifted me ear buds because she was tired of listening to the echo from my previous Bluetooth.

"Bought these so I can use my navigation app in the car without using the car audio.  Works well, except everytime the navigation gives an instruction, the earbuds beep at the beginning (so I miss the first 2 seconds of the instructions) and then say ""call ended"" after instruction is given.  This can be a little annoying.  I haven't figured out if I can adjust the settings to avoid this or not.I haven't had these long enough to know how long the battery will last on one use.",4,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0

You can't control the volume, you can't skip ahead or back a song and even better...a simple double click...which occurs during normal handling...redials the last person you called. DUDE!! Not cool!!!  After calling my husband like 5 times in 8 hours, I decided these need to go back, and I'll try the T6 instead.",1,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
So I was looking for something I could take to the gym that's loud enough so that I couldnt hear my surroundings. Now I'm not looking for noise cancellation as much as I am for clear loud volume but these are a miss in that category. The volume sounds pretty choppy and low and I'm not impressed at all. Even with the value I feel like I could of gotten a better deal elsewhere.,3,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
I like these very much.  After finding the right ear piece to place they fit perfect.  I used the smallest pair provided.  They stay in place.  The sound is good with one in or two in.  Very easy to pair with my phone.  Syncs fast with my music apps.  The only complaint is I wish you could tap them to pause the music instead of taking them out. I love the charger!  Very secure.,4,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I loved these the first two days. The sound quality is equal to or better than my airpods. The noise cancellation is superb. The battery life is several hours. My problem has only begun today, as the sound keeps cutting in and out, on in one ear, off in another. They are fully charged, but the on / off again sound is making me crazy. I really loved these pods.",3,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
This seems to be marketed as earbuds you can wear swimming but the limitations with bluetooth and water make them not work well at all in our experience. If you submerge them the music stops - it's very annoying having the sound swap between ears as you swim. That part was our fault for poor research.However... one of the earbuds has stopped working after only a few months of very light use. Can't seem to get it to reset. The quality of the case is also not nearly as good as other headphones we've used such as Soundpeats.,1,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
To me for the price and quality you can't beat these everyone else pays 200 plus dollars 4 name brand earbuds but to me this is just as good I've listened to the other high price earbuds and cannot tell the difference between them and these would definitely suggest by these instead of the high price name brand earbuds,5,1,2020-7-28,1,1,0
"I bought these ear buds for my husband for Christmas.  He wanted something small that he could put in his ears at night to listen to sermons, books, etc., and that didn't have  ""blinding"" lights on them to keep me awake (small amounts of light keep me awake!)  These ear buds work fantastically and are a great quality for sound.  They also don't have bright lights on them to keep me awake.  I highly recommend these!!",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0

These are okay.  I’m not an audiophile so they sound good to me.  My only problem with them is they’re constantly dead.  I’m not sure why the battery drain while you’re not using them but my other earbuds actually turn off.  This is the same for both of the ones I bought so unless I was just unlucky I think it’s how they were designed.  Unlike my other wireless headphone I can leave them for months and when I turn them on they still ready to go.  They may have “shorter” battery life but I would have rather have longer uninterrupted listening then constantly having to recharge I. The case as I go.  I feel like they only stay charged for 4 hours or so which is a pain when I have to stop listening to charge them.,2,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0

My first we're my favorites but I lost a bud to angry vacuuming 😔 I ordered the pink other version to compare but the other style isn't as loud as this one.

"as I really love this product there is one thing that sticks out to me and almost bothers me enough to send them back. These earbuds have little to no control on the actual earbuds. While there is a left and a right, they both do the same commands and there’s only four of them. And out of those four commands - three of them deal with taking phone calls. Yes that’s an important part to Bluetooth earphones but I can’t even change my music from the buds...all I can do is play or pause my music. I can redial the last number I called through...which is not helpful. I really felt like they wasted the button functions and left out important functions (like skipping music or restarting a song). I’m sorry but I’ve redialed a number maybe a total of 10 times in my life whereas I skip a song at least three times an hour. I just don’t get how making calls can be more important than having normal functioning buttons for music that are literally on every other pair of Bluetooth earbuds.",4,1,2019-9-28,1,0,0
"I like everything about these except the fit. When I insert and wear them as instructed, they stay put for about a minute and then come loose and... plop ...fall on the floor.

These will be going back.",2,1,2019-2-28,1,1,0
"This is the first time I ever felt the need to write a review.  The bad news is the product will not connect to any device.  So for bluetooth headphones there is no rating above 1 start that can be given.  The left ear can connect alone and works, but the right ear is the master headphone so the left ear connects to the right ear and the right ear connects to the phone.  For a brief moment you will hear sound and it is a nice full sound. Unfortunately, the headphone will disconnect and if you listened to the headphones for 5 minutes you might get 10 seconds of music and 4 minutes and 50 seconds of the headphones saying 'disconnected'.

Audio is good, however I'm typically connected to my phone which has bluetooth version 4.1. The audio when connected to my phone isn't as nice when compared to having it connected to my laptop which has a more updated bluetooth version (I'm not a techy person so apologies if my reasoning is off). Quick charge both buds and case. Mic isn't the best but again, first pair of truly wireless earbuds so I've got nothing to compare it to.

Nice to have the magnetic retention in the case when your done along with the charging feature. Helps me get through a whole week of workouts without having to worry about charging.

I only keep one in at a time so I can hear other things around me. Once one dies i just pop it in the case and start on the next. The charging pack seems to last forever. I can't give a specific amount of hours because I keep it charged so its never died on me yet. Even if its on one out of the four bars it charges the pods fully. Love love love it!

I was pretty upset, because even though I had a warranty, I know from past experience how time consuming it is to claim warranty's from manufacturers. TOZO however made it really simple. I let them know via email what happened, and they got back to me within 24 hours! They replaced my earbuds with a new set AND let me keep the defective ones.

This is due to the high frequency from the welder and only happens when you dont strike an arc so its just a little thing but still doesnt change my mind that these are awsome",5,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
"It only took a minute to sit down, sync the earbuds, figure out the wireless charging, and sync the earbuds to my phone. I really like how the earbuds easily snap into the charging case, which I just set on top of a wireless charger. The quality of sound is great, and it does a pretty good job of being noise cancelling. For the price, these were a great purchase.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"The right earbud survived a trip through the washing machine. I am constantly impressed with these things. They're comfortable, though they do slip out. I blame sweat for that, as I wear them under eardrum protective earmuffs. The sound isn't bad at all. My only issue is trying to make the left earbud the master and the right the slave so I can charge one and listen with the other. I haven't had luck with that.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"Like others, I too have had nothing but issues with these. At first, I thought they were great. However, I'm now unable to hear out of them. I would return them but I bought them in January.

"After reading through reviews for a dozen or more earbuds, I decided to give the Tozo Earbuds a try, and I’m glad I did! The packaging they arrived in was really nice. The earbuds paired with my iPhone as soon as I took them out of the charger. The earbuds come with a variety of cushions to ensure that they fit securely in your ears. Once I chose the right size covers, the fit was perfect. I recommend these earbuds to anyone who wants a great product without breaking the bank.",5,1,2019-6-9,1,0,0
"I LOVE these earbuds. You can use just one or both. They are comfortable, and can fit in either ear. I lost my “R” one for two months and after a overnight charge, it works great. I’ve washed them both several times and they’ve never shown any problems afterward. I listen to podcasts while I work so the sound is perfect. Music is great too. One earbud lasts me from about 8:30-2 pm. A quick 30 minute charge will add on about 2 more hours to that. I recommend these highly!",4,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"I have been postponing purchasing a pair of earbuds because I have always felt that the quality of sound was not up to par with wired headphones or blutooth headsets. Not the Tozo T10's. Every action from taking it out of its charging case to syncing it with my iPhone was easy peasy. Crystal clear highs with punchy lows with quiet passages. Couldn't ask for anything better. Well, at times it's difficult to know which is the right and the left because of the dark print on the buds. I'm being too picky because there isn't anything to fault with these exceptional blutooth earbuds. Highly recommended!",5,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0

"Love these headphones! Came as described with very good build quality. In 4 months of use I’ve ran, biked, showered, and walked in the rain with these and they haven’t had a problem. They stay in well dry but slip if water gets in your ear. The coating on one of them is starting to peel which makes me wonder if the water resistance will hold. My only major gripes are that if they are connected to my phone in my pocket the connection will stutter as the phone bounces around in my pocket and that there is no button command to skip or replay songs. I’ve accidentally called friends forgetting that a double tap redials your last number which can be embarrassing when you’re out of breath exercising and you call your boss.",4,1,2020-8-22,1,0,1

I recieved my earbuds and I wasn't too impressed by them. The people at Tozo reached out to me and offered to replace them with a newer model.

"I have only used for a bit now but I honestly love them. I apparently have pretty small ears so I have to use the smallest rubber ""bud caps"" things and they kind of stick a bit out of my ear. They do the job and the sound quality is really great! I also love how they're a lot more affordable than airpods or galaxy buds (they do the same job but they're just unnecessarily expensive!) I would definitely recommend these earbuds but if you know that you have smaller ears/ear canals, just be aware that they're gonna be a bit big for you.",4,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
"Let me start by saying I love these!  They’re Very comfortable and stay in my ear.  I have tiny ears and they still stay put.  I bought these to talk on the phone with and everyone can hear me perfectly.  They can hear everything else too but that’s not a big deal to anyone since they can hear me very well no matter where I am.  Literally my ONLY complaint is that you can’t use them separately,  the right ear is the main ear piece and if that one dies the left ear piece will not work on its own.  That’s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Other wise amazing for music, phone conversation and everything in between. :)",4,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0

"I so badly want to give them 5 stars because I love them. The sound quality is amazing. I use them at night to listen to podcasts so I don't disturb my husband. I sometimes use them for work around the house. The other day I was painting and one of them fell out of my ear and into the paint can. I scooped it up and ran it under a water. I got it clean and it still worked! I know they are waterproof, but fully submerged in latex paint and then washed a lot. They still work! I can't give them five stars because they obviously don't stay in my ears as well as I would like even with the choices of sized buds. They are awesome for what I primarily use them for. I just don't use them for too active stuff.",4,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"I bought those to replace my Dashbon buds after i lost them. When I got it in the mail, I was initially bummed out by how big the charging case was compared to the Dashbons. But I quickly came to appreciate their superior performance. Unlike the Dashbons, they did not turn on and off like crazy when you're just readjusting them in your ears. They pair reliably and well, and battery life is very decent. They are comfortable in my ear and hardly ever fall out.Little tip: if you have problem pairing, put them inside the case. Select them on your bluetooth device and then immediately take them out of the case.",4,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0

Same issues, won't stay in my ear no matter the ear bud size i use.  And the right bud finally died.  I still use the left one from time to time, if I don't mind it falling out every minute.  Don't buy, keep looking.",2,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
I've had these wireless blue tooth earphones for about a month now.

"All magnetic parts fix everything together nicely. The sound quality seems really good to me (not an expert). It definitely cancels out noise when both are in, so be careful. The only possible minus to music is that you lose (becomes more subtle) some of layers of a song with only one earbud in. Which honestly might be how all songs that place different parts on different sides of a headset work. The one BIG bummer is that in order to play/pause with a “tap”, you are legitimately needing to push a flex-type button, so you either shove it into your ear or have to hold the earbud with two fingers while pressing with a third. I wish there was a skip song feature, but just answer/hang up, pause/play, and long press to decline call.",4,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0

After a few emails back and forth, we concluded that there was a malfunction with the battery. They then sent me another pair of earbuds that work just fine. I am very pleased with their response. The headphones are easy to connect and use. The battery/case they come in is easy to carry around. The only problem that I have is that they do not stay in my ears that well. I have tried all the earpieces. I would suggest that they create an earbud that has a foot on it. This way it an hook into the ear and not fall out as easily.

Ok update.The sound shifts from ear to ear mid play often and it’s super annoying. It sometimes goes out of the left bud and breaks up in that bud often. I’m trying to workout and get fit with these but it’s annoying when the sound cuts out like that. I think I’m returning it.,1,1,2019-12-9,1,0,1

There's so many wireless ear bud options these days.  I own several pairs and these would rate the lowest I've owned.  Fit and feel just isn't comfortable compared to competitors.  They're on the larger size yet battery life or sound quality don't reflect that like you'd expect.  The blue flashing light is absolutely annoying when your in a dark location using these as it is VERY bright and honestly pointless.  I'm sure that helps to kill battery life.  The case I'm extremely impressed with.  It don't feel cheap like most.  It does an outstanding job for what it's intended purpose is.  I just wish the ear buds was as good as the case.,2,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0

There are 2 problems with these that make them a terrible choice for this. 1) Bar far the biggest problem is they are too loud. The lowest volume setting is blaring which is too distracting while trying to work. Very Frustrating. 2) They fall out very easily (yes I tried the different sizes of rubber tips that come with it). When I’m eating, yawning, moving around all of a sudden - pop - one will fall out. They have the potential to be good, but are few generations away.",1,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"Love these headphones! They worked easily right out of the box, paired to each other and the phone without a problem. I did have to swap out the ear cups for the smallest ones to get them to not fall out of my ears, but once I did that, they fit perfectly. I'm genuinely surprised by how long they last. Talked with a friend over the phone for 3 and a half hours and they didn't show any sign of dying. Range is impressive, too. I'd say ~30 ft without walls/obstructions. I love that the case can charge wirelessly, and the case charges very quickly - 20 to 30 minutes from completely drained to fully charged. Sound quality is great, nothing to complain about. Price is right. Definitely would buy again.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
Great headphones unless you want them for the gym. They tend to fall out while doing things like squatting or deadlifts. If the gym is what you want them for I would say get some that go around the ear. But that said the only downfall of the headphones themselves is the charging. Once they are charged and left in the case it continues to trickle charge them so the case is constantly going down in battery life.

"I got these about two weeks ago. I was very excited to be able to swim with headphones in to make my workouts a little more entertaining. The sound quality and noise cancelling out of the water were fantastic and I was very impressed right up until I actually went to go and swim. I was under the impression that these were meant to be waterproof, but the left earbud stopped working before I'd swum ten feet and hasn't turned back on since. I think it may be some sort of manufacturing glitch, though, because the right one held up fine. I wasn't terribly impressed with the sound quality underwater. Once the water got into my ears, it was almost impossible to hear, but I will see if I can fix this with the different sizes of attachments that come with the set. Overall, I really, really want to like these, but losing one of the units the second it hit the water doesn't leave me terribly impressed.",2,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
