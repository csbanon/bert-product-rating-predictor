"Not a lot to like on this combo.  Even at this price point (under $30), it's hard to justify buying this.1.  The main impression I got when I opened the package was how cheap it looked and felt.  So plasticky.  So unfinished.  (Even before opening the package, I was surprised by how the vendor shipped it.  No shipping box, no cushioning materials.  It was shipped in the original product box with a mailing label slapped onto it.  Talk about being cheap!)",1,1,2020-1-30,1,8,0
"I got the keyboard and mouse and they are pretty good. Here's the problem. No software, drivers or any instruction. Go to the website to get the software to control the lighting and speed and it does not install properly and caused my windows to crash. After an hour of removing and restarting it is ok. Looks good and I will keep them because they work but I cannot alter the colors or breathing speed or anything. Would be 5 stars with the software.PS. Support on the website is awful. No help at all",1,1,2019-5-3,1,1,0
"Everything arrived very promptly and undamaged. The mouse is excellent and a great step up from the standard optical mouse I had been using. It has 3 DPI settings and offers easy switching in game. The mouse responds very well and has weight adjustment for those who like a heavier mouse. The design is very nice and overall its very comfortable for long gaming sessions. The keyboard is also great. It offers media keys integrated with the function keys and also allows you to re-map your regular arrow keys into the wasd keys which can be very useful for some games. The back light is fairly bright without being annoying and helps while gaming in a dark room. Overall, this bundle is outstanding for its low cost. It offers many features that you would not normally get at this price point and I have noticed an improvement in my gaming with this mouse. Everything also looks very sleek and nice. Great bundle for the price.",5,1,2014-10-31,1,1,0
"The keyboard and mouse it's great for the price. I don't have any problems and the led Red color in this product is perfect for me Because it matches the color of my PC. On the keyboard does not have much light But that's one of the reasons why I love it, since I do not like having lots of light and for the price I think it offers quite a lot of this combo.The mouse is the best part, great design and feels amazing in my hand. The keyboard is great too, but the mouse feels a lot of better. How ever, its a good basic combo for gaming and I recommend for peoplo who don't want to spend to much money on this part.",5,1,2017-7-15,1,2,1
"Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don't necessarily agree with the ""you get what you pay for"" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can't beat this combo.The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange ""tall"" type that relocates the ""\"" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.",5,1,2016-1-19,1,2,0
"This is far far below the level expected.  I rarely give a bad review but this is awful.  The buttons are mushy and give poor feedback to being struck, they feel like they sightly stick upon being pressed so typing regularly is difficult.  The keyboard that came with computer is much better as a comparison.  On a plus... It does look good and the cord is solid...",1,1,2017-7-5,1,1,0
"I bought the keyboard + mouse set as an upgrade from my previous keyboard. I had an old emachines keyboard that I dearly loved, but the print has worn off many keys and some of the keys take considerable pressure to function, so it was time to upgrade. I will be using this for coding and extensive word processing, not gaming, so that's what this review is based on.Mouse: The mouse is nice. It's got a nice weight. The texture on the buttons gives it a good feel. It glides on the mousepad well with no skips. It's plug-and-play, although you need the driver in order to program the extra buttons. (see below) I haven't used the DPI switch, since I wont' need this for my work. The funny little contour points at the back end of the mouse are quite handy for moving the mouse around when selecting large amounts of text. No noticeable delay between click and computer response.",4,1,2018-10-7,1,6,0
"So, what do I like about this set? Not a SINGLE thing. The mouse began to malfunction within about 10 days, and proved to be worthless for regular PC use, and even more useless of low level games ( like those on POGO) so for it to be promoted as a ""gaming set"" is absurd. (unless annoying flashing lights equals good performance in the eyes of gamers) It doesn't track and clicking is fairly hit and miss. About 1/3 of the times when you click it does nothing, and the side buttons are hair trigger and they shut screens and change where you are at the lightest brush. As of the AM it is in a thousand pieces, because the only pleasure I have gotten out of this POS waste of plastic was stomping it into  oblivion after it closed out and lost a document when I brushed on of those side buttons with my thumb while trying to make the cursor move. If I could go punch the person who developed this POS in the mouth, I'd fly to China to do it. The keyboard is a whole 'nother thing...It is designed for people with very tiny hands apparently, and anyone with a sizable reach, who was trained on a typical/standard keyboard, will make constant typing mistakes...and honestly, the whole color thing is just freaking annoying, and you have to manually set it to the least annoying setting every time you restart your computer. Who needs that? Maybe a teenager who doesn't have anything real to accomplish on a computer, but not a normal human who has actual work to do. Beyond that, some keys you really have to strike fairly hard to make the keystroke register, other times if you brush the top of a button as you are moving around the keyboard to type, it will register that keystroke, so spelling mistake are an every single minute occurrence unless one types in the same manner as I was taught in High School typing class ( every keystroke performed with hands hovering about an inch over the keyboard, and my hands in full secretarial position.) I bought this POS set January 24, and today is April 27th, and I bought it because it had such high ratings for usability, and the price was decent...I wasn't expecting it to last more than a year or so, because that seems to be about the length of time and any keyboard and mouse will last these days, even with just average use. This POS lasted 3 months ( okay, I might have gotten another week out of it had I not taken the extreme pleasure of smashing the mouse...and the Keyboard is next as soon as I can shop in person for a new one that hopefully won't be yet another piece of crap) If it were possible to leave a negative rating for this crap set, I absolutely would.",1,1,2020-4-27,1,4,0
"Like many others before me, I am awesome, and I purchased this keyboard.Now I can switch between Excel, Word, and Powerpoint faster than all my coworkers that I work with at work. Our engineering co-ops refer to me a the ""yeet-man"". Need an image file converted to pdf? BAM 10 seconds flat... including my email sending it back to you. Scroll to the bottom of that message you'll see that I've already added ""RedDragon"" to my email signature. Word of my dominance is spreading quickly through the company (mostly thanks to an idiot coworker who clicked 'reply-all'), and even my boss hesitates to check the color of my keyboard before interrupting my intensity. Game on ladies and gentlemen, 'cause I'm bringing the juice every day.",5,1,2019-11-27,1,3,0
"After Abusing this keyboard and mouse with hardcore gaming, I can say that it's Overall a good buy. There are some things to note for the Nerdy Peeps out there. (I just bought this order again)-The Keyboard's rubber backing under the keys is one large piece across the entire board. In other words, you will not easily be able to replace a key membrane with another one.",4,1,2019-5-16,1,4,0
"I was very taken by the look and durability reviews to purchase this item and up til this morning was quite happy with it. I went to log in this morning and suddenly the Ctrl, Alt and delete keys weren’t working. Having recently gotten a new laptop from work I thought perhaps it was just a fluke. However once logging in, when typing I noticed other keys not working (you never realize how many times you use the letter h til you don’t have it..).While the lights in the keyboard were still working, I tried the keyboard in several other USB ports, still nothing.",1,1,2018-12-18,1,7,0
"The instructions are beyond bad- go to the website for redragonusa doc com/downloads and grab drivers for the mouse there- But the Keyboard ""lighting"" info comes with Zero instructions - Use the FN Key + look for [LM1] through [LM5] [Insert, Home, Page Up, Delete, End keys] and Finally the annoying display calms down. also the up down arrows with the FN key softens or brightens the colors too.Simple instructions would make it so much easier and yet non-existing on the box or instructions. (facepalm)",4,1,2019-2-8,1,5,0
"Picked up this set to include with a computer I'm selling. Took it out to take pictures and am not very impressed. The keyboard is alright, feels cheap but decent enough. The mouse however is very plastic feeling. Would say for a cheap set the keyboard is fine but the mouse leaves a lot to be desired.The RGB on the keyboard is poor. I have some very high end mech rgb keyboards and those flow like water. This keyboard more of flashes. The issue I see is the color is broken up into zones, aka 3 or 4 rows of keys meaning there's a jerky flow to its movement. Honestly, I think they'd of been better off just making the keyboard sold colors.",3,1,2019-9-6,1,2,0
"This keyboard and mouse work. They're perfectly serviceable. The light options on the keyboard are nice. That's the extent of the good things I can say about this set, unfortunately.To start with, the mouse. I thought I was getting a five-button gaming mouse (not including scroll wheel): I did not. The two side buttons are MACRO playback buttons that require Redragon's propriety and obviously-machine-translated software to function. The macro function sucks because it doesn't have good manual editing; you cannot type in a set of instructions to push X button at Y time, etc, etc, the way you could with AutoHotKey. You have to record all the keystrokes in the correct order and manually edit the timing/delete anything. But you cannot add!",2,1,2019-9-19,1,4,1
"Easy install, plug and play so no software needed, I wish the print was larger in the instructions, but after reading it and finding what keys change the colors everything works as it should, I really like the way you can change the whole weight of the mouse, makes it feel well planted and the movements are very precise. Keyboard is almost silent when pressing the keys, no more click click click when typing, and that did take a little getting use too but not long. I found that the default settings work well for what I'm doing so I doubt I'll be changing any of those. So for the price it is a good buy and the quality seems to be very good. I would recommend this combo for anyone that wants something better than a standard keyboard and has some flare too it.",5,1,2018-1-27,1,6,0
Easy to configure. the keyboard does not clutter your desk. I like the quiet keys.Update: 2020-07-26,3,1,2020-7-9,1,2,1
"Quality is about what you would expect for a $15 keyboard and $10 mouse, but with the added features of backlighting and macro/dpi for the mouse. Not really ""gaming"" quality, although the software does offer macro creation (see walkthrough below for software use).Keyboard:",5,1,2019-12-19,1,1,0
"The build on both keyboard and mouse feels solid, and neither feel like they were cheaply made. They're very comfortable to use, and just feel nice.What I really don't like is how they're controlled. The mouse has multiple DPI stages that can be cycled through, but the stage that it defaults to when powered on is way too low right out of the box. There were a few other changes that I wanted to make, but it didn't come with any drivers or software. I hunted around and found that the driver software for the M601 also work, since the mouse is identical. It now appears that software is included, but it was a nuisance for me.",3,1,2019-1-8,1,2,0
"I was looking for a lighted keyboard to put on my home theater PC, that I've found I am gaming on that big screen here more lately.  I was just using an old basic HP keyboard I had laying around, but given I use this in the dark it was of course impossible to see the keys with just the light from the screen.On my main desktop I have a Razer Black Widow, and I love it, so I have something to compare this one to. I didn't want to spend that much on a keyboard for the home theater PC, but still wanted the backlight.",5,1,2020-6-30,1,1,0
"I actually quite love this setup.  I needed a backlit keyboard for use in a very dark environment and this keyboard and mouse set is awesome!  So, why only 3 stars?  BOTH devices fail to recall their settings after every single shut down and boot.  It would be well worth the extra few pennies it would cost to throw in a tiny bit of memory, and would have received 5 stars.  To me, it's annoying enough to knock off 2 stars.My other complains is the lack of driver support for either of these devices.  The combination set isn't even listed on Redragon's website, and after searching for them separately for some time, I was disappointed to find they don't have software packages anyways.",3,1,2019-9-23,1,1,0
"So I've used Razer keyboards for gaming for years but the quality/price ration wasn't great so I decided to try something else. I found this and was a bit skeptical but oh wow I was impressed! As an avid gamer who spends most of her free time typing, gaming and on the computer in general I'm thoroughly impressed. The keys are soft to the touch, silent and responsive. The lighting is good, if you type in the dark it's really helpful! The colors can be changed to be crazy RGB running all over, or a soft neutral color (i picked white) as the backlight. Fully adjustable.The only negative I have is the mouse. I wasn't intending to buy a mouse but figured I'd try it. I'm a fairly small girl with small hands but this mouse is pretty small for even me. Not unusable but I definitely prefer the larger mice that are a little more comfortable on the hand. Otherwise as far as quality/price...BUY IT. Seriously. I just bought a second one for my husband and he loves it. It's totally worth it!",5,1,2019-7-21,1,3,0
"Where to begin...well lets start with the good. The keyboard and mouse are quite comfortable. I loved the weight of the mouse. Yep, that's all of the good currently. As for the bad: No software came in the packaging. I had to google the software which took me to a youtube video where I found a link. Problem is that the website you go to doesn't specifically list this combo. Installing the mouse software was smooth. It had all your typical button settings and a macro manager. Problem is that one of the ""programmable buttons"" did not show up in the software. That middle chevron button next to the wheel was not listed. The keyboard software didn't even detect the keyboard, so didn't get a chance to make any adjustments. I tried to get everything to work for an hour before giving up. But here is the really odd thing. I have 3 screen. The mouse pointer stopped at the edge of each screen. Yeah totally odd. I fooled around with various settings and got it to work then rebooted. On reboot, none of my mouse settings were saved, and oddly, two of my monitors were no longer recognized by Win10. I decided to go back to scratch so uninstalled the software and drivers., connected my old mouse and keyboard, rebooted...and everything returned to normal. I sent an email into support to see what they can do for me. We'll see what happens.",2,1,2020-5-15,1,1,0
"I didn't have a lot of money to spend on a k/m so I got this, I wish I would have saved up for something better. I made the mistake of trusting Amazon reviews, I guess these people had low expectations. For one, you can't change the color of the mouse (red only) and it keeps pulsing but I don't think there's a way to stop it. It supposed to show the speed of the mouse pointer which I guess some people want but I think it should be at least an option, not forced on you. The next problem is the keys are hard to read if you rely on the back lighting, for example, the letters are fine but anything like the number keys, which have a number on the bottom and a !@#$% etc. on the top are nearly impossible to read. Then, there's the fact that it doesn't save your color/lighting settings, if you disconnect the keyboard or don't use it for a few days it goes back to the default, annoying, flashing rainbow. If these things don't bother you then this combo is otherwise fine, especially for the price, but I was expecting better after seeing all of these positive reviews.",1,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"In a short time using the keyboard and the mouse, I have fallen in love with the features and buttery smoothness of use.  I love the feel of the keys on the keyboard and makes typing a joy.  Smooth and the key travel has a nice feel for an assurance of the feedback click and clacking of the keys.  The mouse is so smooth and nice to move about the pages and tabs.  Also, has the buttons and keys with an assurance of accurate usage. I am not a gamer per se, but I love these types of devices to make my time on my computer enjoyable and very smooth. I have had other types of keyboards and mouses.  Wireless and with direct wire connections but never truly satisfied with the action and usage of the devices.  At times it would feel like a chore in engaging with the devices.  Making my typing assignments a nightmare in attempting to type what is needed in a timely manner.  I love my Redragon keyboard and mouse, for the price, it is a sound investment for the time spent on my computer to type out emails, reports, or my future best-selling novel.  Fantastic product and devices.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"This keyboard and mouse combo is a great value. The mouse is is acceptable for gaming and the keyboard is not half bad either. The lights are a nice edition, though they do not seem to hold a memory unless the computer stays in sleep mode. If you shut down the memory is cleared and the default rainbow option is kind of annoying. But I got this set for less than $25.00 and at that price is a real bargain.Pros:",4,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
The whole thing feels very nice to use and isn't as loud as some other gaming keyboards I've heard in the past. While you definitely hear the keys the noise isn't obnoxious and quiet enough that you can't even really hear it with headphones on (which is how I spend most of my time anyway) if you're using your gaming PC as a work computer as well you shouldn't have any issue using this for prolonged periods of time even if you're typing a lot.The mouse is pretty cool as well and the only issues I'm having (just after setting it up) are definitely user errors. I can't get fn+home to set it to a solid color but the home button works and the other commands work perfectly. The instructions are a little vague at first on how to do certain things but enough clicking around on the mouse (which desperately needed it's DPI changed out of the box IMO) got me to where I needed it.,5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"Read the reviews of the keyboard and mouse combo, so I ordered it to replace my Cool Master Devastator II that a few keys stopped working after 4 years. I was happy to get package, so I could get back to my work. I do play games, and also I am a writer and artist and use my computer for both.Checked their website to see if there any drives to download, seen there was one so I downloaded it. Plugged in both keyboard and mouse, at first everything seemed to work fine, about after 10 minutes, my music player started going crazy cycling through the playlist that I was playing. I unplugged and than plugged it in again, and it solved the problem. About a week later I moved the keyboard a little and it started cycling through music tracks again, but I was not even playing music at the time. I did same thing unplugged and plugged in. Now it happens every few days if on its own, or if you move the keyboard. It is a bit annoying, That is just the first issue.",1,1,2020-7-24,1,1,0
"Great keyboard for the price, more than i expected. Typing is very comfortable and the product is well built. It's nice that you can change backlit options from the keyboard itself but i would like to have some software as well because there is no option to adjust every key separately. Overall i am very pleased.As for the mouse, i am a little disappointed. Firstly, it is ridiculously heavy, i removed all of the weight pieces and it's still noticeably heavier than my previous mouse. Probably because the mouse isn't small at all, anything larger would be too large. People with large hands will like it though.",4,1,2018-1-18,1,3,0
"the mouse works but not the keyboard. i got the keyboard and hooked it up and it worked beautifully for about 3 days before the enter key was a bit touche.i tried to fix it in 20 different ways none of them worked, and all the keys around the enter button would hit enter when you hit them. as time when on it just kept getting worse and worse the shift key wouldn't work on the left hand side and if it was pressed it would shut down the rest of the keyboard.",1,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
"This is one of the best keyboards I've ever had. For the record, I've never had a keyboard costing more than 25 ish, for 28 dollars the keyboard alone is worth it. The mouse is ok, decent quality but nothing to write home about ( I use the mouse on a secondary system). For the price I've had no better keyboard, the keys have a rubberish feel, not too loud, depress nicely and accurately. The rgb could be brighter, but works well and easily . My biggest complaint is the keys seem a little small, but otherwise has performed awesomely plaing games like rage 2, borderlands 3, and outer worlds.  This keyboard is well worth the price, just think of it as buy the keyboard get the mouse for free.",4,1,2019-11-29,1,2,0
"I wasn't expecting much for $30 but this keyboard exceeded all expections for me.  Firstly, I didn't realize how horribly laggy and imprecise my wireless keyboard and mouse were.  The one game i play on my PC was completely transformed as I discovered it was my horrible wireless devices that made me a bad player.  LOL.  Secondly, once you figure out how to disable the silly flashing rainbow default lighting setup, you have a brilliant backlit keyboard with a complete range of colors and lighting schemes to use in different lighting environments.  Finally, those that miss the old mechanical IBM keyboards, this $30 keyboard comes surprisingly close to replicating a good amount of the mechanical feel I miss so much from them.  And you don't have to pay close to $200 to get some of that back.  The Keyboard layout is largely the classic IBM layout as well.  The quibbles I have are minor considering this is a $30 backlit keyboard and 3,600 dpi gaming mouse.  1) The top half of the symbols above the number keys are dimly lit.  Not a huge issue but annoying.  2) The keyboard keys are very light to the touch which some people might like.  I miss the old heft and sturdiness of the old IBM mechanical keyboard keys.  But hey, for $30....  3)  Some silly graphics and lighting on the mouse but then again, only $30....I would highly recommend this to anyone getting fed up with their wireless chiclet keyboard and glitchy wireless mouse.  It's also a cheap test of a 3,600 dpi gaming mouse and keyboard to see if there really is a difference between standard keyboards and mice and gaming dedicated hardware.  There definitely is a difference.  .",1,1,2020-3-11,1,1,0

"My job gave me a computer with a crap ass keyboard that had broken feet and the previous guy's nastiness all over the keys.  I could have waited for them to slowly decide when it was in the budget to replace a crap ass stock keyboard with another crap ass stock keyboard, but I decided I had waited long enough.  If I am going to spend the better part of 8 hours staring at a computer, I might as well make it my own.  So I dropped a couple of bucks and got a keyboard and mouse that would be complete overkill for an office environment... and it's perfect.  Why?  Because now my boring ol' office has some uniqueness to it, making me forget I am trapped at a desk.  Now I am trapped at a desk with peripherals that are much better than anyone else.  This may not be a big deal to you, but in my mind, it's better to do the mundane tasks on a keyboard that visually distracts me with colorful bliss.  The mouse takes the feeling of dread I had from clicking that worn out stock mouse and gives me the excitement I need to not only click, but DOUBLE CLICK as well.  I'm sure i could play games and other things with it too.So why did I buy a gaming mouse and keyboard for an office computer?  Because I'm awesome.

"I have had this for several months now. This is not a perfect keyboard. However, for the price it is amazing. The only two cons I can think of are that 1) the plastic it's made of feels slightly cheap, but it has held up to daily use very well. 2)  When you shut down your computer, it forgets the color setting you put it on and defaults to rainbow mode. (putting the computer to sleep does not reset color selection) Changing the color settings are very simple, though, and it only takes me a second to get it back in my preferred mode. As for pros, the colors are bright but not too distracting. The keys have a satisfying action and feel very responsive. It has just the right amount of mechanical keyboard noise for me without being overly clicky-clacky.The mouse that comes with the keyboard is simple but solid. It only lights up in red, it's not RGB. However, I bought this keyboard set because I already had experience using this brand of mouse and wanted another one for my new pc. As a casual gamer, this set perfectly fills my needs and I will most likely buy it again.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0

I didn't really care about the mouse, but since it was part of the package, figured ""what the hell""...The mouse would be nice, EXCEPT the driver software that controls all of its functionality does not work unless the mouse is plugged directly into the PC.  If you have a KVM switch, the driver software will refuse to start up.  If you try to get around this by temporarily plugging the mouse into the PC directly and configuring it with the driver software, those settings will be LOST once you disconnect it and plug it back into your KVM switch.",3,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
This was the second one I bought. Since I had a stroke it is easier pm me with the lighted keyboard to see and type. It great looking ley board but the letters on the board started not working.

"Tactile feedback is good on the keyboard, but it's taking a bit of time for me to get used to the layout of the keyboard compared to my old trusty Dell keyboard that this was replacing. That, I'll chock up to just me needing more time to get used to it. The weights in the mouse make it feel nice. However, there is no official software for the keyboard, which resets back to rainbow puke every time I boot my computer, which with my ADHD is distracting. The website doesn't officially support the mouse anymore, but the M601-3 mouse drivers and software are compatible, which also helps to remap the buttons. Ordinarily I'd like to turn off the lights for this keyboard, but with them off, the keys are really dull, so I leave them on a solid red during use. Also, was afraid that my keyboard was broken on arrival, but it just doesn't work in a USB 2.0 port and needs USB 3.In short:",4,1,2020-6-11,1,1,0
"This product is absolutely amazing!!! The keyboard feels amazing and works so well when I'm playing Guild Wars 2. The last keyboard I had would always stick whenever I was doing jumping puzzles, which is annoying especially when you are high up and a missed or over jump results in falling and, usually, instant death. And for some puzzles, this means restarting from the beginning, which is hard and often times extremely frustrating. If you are a gamer, then this is the keyboard for you.The mouse that comes with this set is also amazing. It is wired, which is better than the gaming mouse I had before this one was. (wireless rechargeable gaming mouse. Not sure why I even thought that was a good idea LOL). It is very responsible and while that buttons are loud, it isn't bad. I played a fractal last night with some of my guildmates and I had zero lose of mouse control, which was common with my old wireless mouse.",5,1,2019-11-24,1,1,0
"I was looking for a keyboard/mouse set to play some games on my PS4 (trying to get used to it before getting a PC) and this set is exactly what I wanted. It works flawlessly, all I had to do was plug it in. No adaptor, no extra USB hub... nothing. It works GREAT right out of the box!It’s also really cool looking; the mouse has a fabric wire which is really nice to have, and both cords are very long. I really love this set and I’m really happy with my purchase! Awesome stuff.",5,1,2018-4-23,1,3,0
"I bought this combination, expecting it to work out of the box. The Keyboard is beautiful and does a fine job of working for what I intend it for. The mouse... No spring back for either left or right mouse buttons. I am a little more than peeved at seeing this obvious factory issue make it all the way to my doorstep. Still mulling over what to do - I may send this back. Poor quality control.Update: On closer inspection, the mouse had been misaligned at the factory and the top and bottom pieces of the mouse body were not aligned correctly. I watched a video on YouTube for this mouse as to how to disassemble and reassemble the mouse and after a few minutes I had the mouse repaired. I *WILL* be covering this on my YouTube channel since I plan to review this combo set.",5,1,2018-8-4,1,2,0
"I bought this for my kid so I wasn't too concerned about what I thought about it for a low cost keyboard and mouse combo. They just wanted the lights. But after using it myself on their system, I have to say the mouse and keyboard actually feel and work really really good!  And the LEDs actually look really good on both of them too! They beat up both a lot and still work after 4 plus months with no issues.While I am still planning to replace my workhorse basic keyboard with a programmable RGB like the Corsair K70 RGB or something by G.Skill or Logitech; if you are looking for a great budget combo with lights. This ones feels great to type on and looks great too for the price. I really am shocked. If you are building a new system and want to space out spending money on the really nice gaming keyboards, or refreshing the experience on and old system with worn keyboard, this is a great option. I didn't test for ghosting, but I didn't have any issues with any games or software.",5,1,2018-7-11,1,1,0
"My son wasn't enjoying my old 2005 logitech wireless and keyboard with his gaming so we grabbed this deal. So far we are all happy, the mouse is accurate and has a nice feel. The keyboard looks great with the backlit colors, which can pulse, scroll, and be dimmed and brightened. The keys have a bit softer of a feel than I am used to but it hasn't hindered me in any way. For this price we couldn't be happier, we very much recommend this.",5,1,2018-8-25,1,1,1
"I've only been using the keyboard at work for about week, and so far it's been great. I like that I can select a 'solid' color (vs multiple colors) and each day I change the color (Fn+Home) - I've received lots of comments on the cool colors. The keys are a perfect distance from each other & are easy to press. My old MS keyboard at home forces me to use more pressure on the keys & therefore I find I make more typos. I don't have that problem with this keyboard. The only thing I miss having is a button for the calculator.I like the mouse too. The only complaint is that sometimes my forefinger doesn't automatically find the scroll wheel (it's between two ridges that are slightly too high) & I have to look at the mouse to find it.",5,1,2017-12-13,1,9,0
"I just got this product, after it was delayed for a day.The mouse works great but the keyboard came defective, I will have to return it, because several keys (W, H, ., backspace, delete) don't work.",1,1,2017-12-1,1,9,0
"Very quiet.  Tested with colleague and he can barely hear me typing while on a call which is why I bought it.  Great tactile feel.  Would be 5 star, but I can't seem to set the default LED scheme of mouse dpi.  I use the keyboard and mouse on a switch between my work laptop and my personal desktop.  Everytime I swap back and forth the LED scheme resets back to the annoying blinking rainbow.  I have to reset it to a steady single color glow each time.  Same with the mouse and dpi setting.  I have to reset it each time.  Not hard to reset each time, but certainly annoying.",4,1,2020-6-15,1,1,0
"Hey, I've been using an 11$ keyboard I got from biglots for the past 9 or 10 years, so this review is in that scope.This keyboard starts up boasting a rainbow lightshow that can easily be turned off or changed by holding the FN key near right shift and interacting with the arrow keys, and the block of keys containing prnt screen and delete and so on.",5,1,2018-12-8,1,0,0
"I really like this keyboard and mouse. I'm not a gamer but I do use the computer a lot for work and school. I got tired of my wireless keyboard and mouse because it started causing some typing delays, it was getting annoying. My husband plays on the computer but has not tried this set yet. He thought it was pretty ""fancy"" after I set it up today. I like that the keyboard doesn't sound like my old one with the clickity-clack, the mouse makes the same clickity sound though, but it's more tolerable than my old one.Light: I like how there are options for the lights. I don't like the breathing different colors as I find it too distracting. So, I'm glad that it gives the option of just setting it to one color light, and one setting of light mode - which I prefer to be just on. The mouse doesn't seem to have that option? It's only red color, and breathing mode.",4,1,2020-9-9,1,0,1
"This keyboard/mouse was fine with me for everything except word processing. The flaw is that, when you use the key combination SHIFT-ENTER the keyboard is supposed to send out a carriage return code followed by line-feed code (usually abbreviated when talking about it as CRLF).This keyboard sends out nothing when those two keys are used together.",3,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"Is this the greatest gaming KB and mouse? This combo costs less than half as much as most budget priced gaming keyboards! Hell, it's half the price of a Razer mouse pad! But honestly, for my first gaming KB and mouse, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of both items. The mouse is actually pretty damn good, and the keyboard is very adequate, though of the two, I prefer the mouse.I've since moved on to bigger and better(?) gaming peripherals. Right now I'm rocking the Alienware aw768, which costs $114. I also have but no usually use a Razer Mamba TE edition, whose MSRP at launch was something like $90. Now, I love my Alienware KB, though I didn't care for the Mamba. Can I justify spending $114 on a KB when I could get this combo for 30 bucks? HELL NO!!!",4,1,2018-11-2,1,1,0
"My old keyboard died after many years of use/abuse, RIP.  Bought two of these and upgraded another machine with unit # 2.  Overall, it's decent but I discovered the hard way that certain keys are not mapped properly and certain combinations don't work at all.  For example, LShift + LCtrl + U (a combo I use alot for work) does not register on either of the two units I bought.  After testing it with a scan code monitor, I see the LShift and LCtrl keys working but the U is missing from the combo.  It just does not register that third key in combo if two left modifiers are in the mix.  If I use the RShift and/or RCtrl in that combo, the U keypress works just fine.  Digging a little deeper I found other key combos that don't work.So, this is probably a non-issue for the gaming community (doesn't affect mine any) but I only need/want one keyboard and I expect it to function for work, play, or anything else I do that requires a keyboard.  I took for granted that all keyboards work the same way but are differentiated by tactile and bling features.  Not so.  This one fails at a fundamental level for work tasks, although it does look good doing it I suppose.  The biggest loss for me is the time spent figuring what the heck was going on.  Too late to return them but I'll know which brand to avoid in the future.  Fool me once...",2,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0

"The keyboard and mouse are alright, they do just what they're supposed to by typing and clicking. The lights on the keyboard are fairly easy to change and nothing is out of place. I will agree with some  comments that the wrist rest is awkward, it's just long enough to hit the palm of your hand but too short to rest on it.My biggest complaint is that the software downloads are non-existent or difficult to find. If you search S101-3, there are no software downloads. I eventually found that the mouse is actually a M601-3 Centrophorus Mouse and downloading the software for that will allow you to customize the keys, record macros, etc. I haven't done much with that, I did try to map the side buttons to skip songs and it didn't work. If you find the keyboard, the software doesn't recognize the keyboard at all. The closes I could find was the K503 RGB LED keyboard.",3,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
"I have a fair amount of screen real estate that I use for video and soundtrack editing. I recently vastly improved my computer resources, MB, RAM, GPU and CPU (Threadripper), CAT 7 cabling, everything is bigger, better and faster, except my wireless mouse and keyboard. A decrease in accuracy, dependability and speed were slowing me down. I dusted off an old USB wired mouse and keyboard and viola, it was a little better. I like positive feedback from the keyboard. I also like back lit keyboards. I like stability in the mouse and great travel distance in small moves when needed. And, I like to feel the mouse, smooth is nice but texture is better. Quick button, short travel results are appreciated. And $$ need to be conserved. So, I took a chance on a “gaming” keyboard and mouse. No regrets with this Red Dragon S101-3 combo. Now after several hours of work, I could not be happier. Accuracy, speed, stability and tactile feedback are A plus. I very much appreciate the adjustable dpi.  The shortcut buttons are a nice, and welcome addition. The bonus is the bling in the variety of backlit options easily changed. Never thought I would care about that, but it is fun.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0
"Honestly, there's not a lot to say about this keyboard and mouse combo. For the most part, it's a no frills combo that will get the job done for us gamers on a budget. I've been using the combo to play extended sessions of Ring of Elysium, and I haven't missed a beat.Keyboard feels great to type on, and has a decent sound when keys are pressed, which is satisfying. I really like the RBG as well.",5,1,2018-10-4,1,2,0

"This is a normal keyboard.  I bought in anticipation of replacing another keyboard that was giving me problems.  About 30 days later my old keyboard, was having a problem with a few keys including the return key and I was happy to have this keyboard ready.  I thought it would have some ergonomic qualities.  It has little legs you can set up to change the angle of the keyboard and that is about the extent of its ergonomic characteristics.  The keys are super smooth, so they are a little slippery for me.  My hands are a little on the dry side.  I bought this keyboard, because I thought it was a good deal for an ergonomic keyboard and did not really pay too much attention to the gaming aspect of it.  It has flashing lights that are kind of annoying, but if you read the instruction manual you can adjust them to a single color, flashing and non-flashing or no light at all.  It is very hard to see without a light, though.  Not sure how it will work at night, but I think it will work nicely and in that regard I think it offers something not on my previous keyboard.  In daytime hours it is hard to see the keys, as the characters are not painted on, but are rather are see through .  I would not recommend for anyone  looking for an ergonomic keyboard.  At first I was unhappy with it, but once I figured how to adjust the lights I am okay with it and are actually happy I can use it at night without additional lighting.  The fact that it came with a mouse is an additional bonus, so yeah I would buy again for the price, but I think if I could fight an ergonomic keyboard for the same price I would buy ergonomic.",4,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
"I've only been using it since yesterday, but I am already won over by this keyboard and mouse combo. Now, the M601-3 Centrophorus mouse is great. It's heavy, glides smoothly, the buttons are responsive, and the size is just right for my hands. That alone is worth the money, but I'm not focusing on the mouse in this review, but the keyboard.This keyboard is a delight. Typing on it is comfortable, the keys are sturdy, give a nice tactile response, and aren't so loud as to wake sleeping members of the household as I type. There was a time when I could type 130 WPM with zero errors, but for years that number was severely reduced due to a number of issues: carpal tunnel, arthritis, and poorly made keyboards. Right now I'm typing around 110 WPM with zero errors, and the keyboard isn't even breaking a sweat. This is probably the best it will ever get for me, but I am already amazed. I never thought I'd be able to type this fast ever again, but the keyboard is laid out in such a way, with the keys themselves offering a terrific response that lets my fingers bounce from one key to another without any interference or lag, that I don't even feel like I'm straining at keeping up the pace.",5,1,2017-11-29,1,6,0
"No really, I know nothing about gaming.  If you're reading this review and you're a gamer... you probably want to read another one.  If you're the mother of a 10 year old kid who wants a gaming keyboard and you looked them up and were all ""Uh... yeah no. I'm not spending that on a gaming keyboard"" and you came to Amazon - this fits the bill.  My particular 10 year old isn't a hardcore gamer either, he just watches youtube video's and the people who have loud high pitched voices and British accents (why are they all British?) must use them (not this one, gaming keyboards/mice in general). Anyway, I got him this for Christmas and he loves the keyboard.  He says the mouse could use one more button but he likes it anyway.  He uses this with a PS4, I'm pretty sure it can be used with xbox and obviously it would work with a PC.",5,1,2019-1-22,1,1,0
Product worked great and would have been a 5 star but the space bar stopped working after 5 months. The keyboard is considered computer equipment so only a 30 day warranty applies.Took apart to see if there was an issue with a spring and their are cheap rubber buttons that act as springs. The one for the space bar was deteriorated down to nothing and many others looked about to fail.,1,1,2019-7-14,1,1,0
"This is a great combo for the money! I've been using my set for about 2 years without issues now. I type quickly and aggressively, so the only issue I would say I have is that for someone on his computer 8-12 hours a day, the c key has started to scratch up a bit. I'm shocked at the excellent quality and responsiveness of this keyboard; I would say that it's a bit squishy as far as keyboards go, though.If you enjoy membrane keyboards and want an easy-to-use combo, this will support you pretty well. Mechanical keyboards are not the end-all, and for people who type more aggressively/quickly, I can't emphasize enough that membrane keyboards still have their place. This is pretty darned comfy and plush to type on for the money, and I can't see myself forking out another $100 for the level of performance I get.",5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"In the game I play, function keys are used to move from one position to another in a vehicle.  When I press any one of them, it is interpreted as a mapping to some (at this point USELESS) utility like ""help"" or notepad. This YANKS YOU OUT OF THE GAME, typically at a critical time.  There's no documentation that says how to turn this ""feature"" off, so you're stuck with it. For a keyboard advertised as a ""gaming"" keyboard, I would expect something that works IN GAMES.  This makes the keyboard worse than the one I replaced.",1,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0
You get a great (wired) mouse and decent (wired) keyboard with this combo - for the price of a typical wireless keyboard.

They are meant to convey sizes.,5,1,2019-10-20,1,0,1
"Edit: After the manufacturer replied to me they explained how to get the keyboard lighting set to a steady color, and how to adjust the brightness to my liking, or at least far closer than I was able to from watching videos about the keyboard. While it would be nice if clear information about how to adjust settings was either on or in the packaging so that people wouldn't have to go searching for it, this does make the keyboard far mor functional for my use, and I have therefore updated my rating to 4 stars from 2. Leaving old review below for reference.For the price it's not bad, but the fact that you can't select a single color and brightness for the backlighting to stay at is a great annoyance and makes the keyboard rather unusable long term in my opinion. I want to be able to see the keys, all the time, without having to focus on a new color or wait for the light to fade back in. I don't get the point of this ""feature"". The mouse is nice. Keyboard is otherwise perfectly functional.",4,1,2020-2-15,1,1,0
"I have been working from a computer for over a decade and I do not know why this is the first time I've actually invested in a quality keyboard and mouse. It does make a difference, a significant improvement!I used to think I was just a sloppy typist and blamed myself for constantly having to go back and fix words in my sentences. After an hour of typing on this keyboard - I quickly realized that I am a GREAT typist and that my cheap ""dollar store"" quality keyboards I've used in the past were the issue! I found myself flying through emails, never having to look down at the keyboard, and trusting that every letter and number I type would actually work and type as intended. The keys feel great, they are responsive and sensitive, and they all work perfectly.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"I like the set and I will keep it, but I do have some complaints, The amazon descriptions says software is included. That's not true. You have to go to the website which they do not give the web address in the directions. you have to download a zip installer to be able to open the mouse files that you download. I spent a long time trying to find the drivers and then figuring out how to open the file.  The mouse is a M106 but that's not what it says on the back of the mouse. The lights on the keyboard are not very bright. There are several different colors but you can not choose one color and keep it, it has to scroll through all 7 colors. my keyboard had a manual but my mouse did not and directions are very basic and generic. Keep in mind a young person will have no problem but if your somewhat older you will struggle a bit.",4,1,2019-11-8,1,1,0
"For the price, it seems to be a good value.  It delivers as advertised, there is nothing I have found that I  would rate poorly.  A couple of nitpicky features could be improved and most likely are on more expensive models.Mainly, I would like the light on the keys to be brighter and I have used Red Dragon's wired mouse for years and have loved them for both function and awesome design.  I wish the keyboard had a similar appearance.  The logo not being lit is a little disappointing but this too may be due to the price point which may not be really worth it.  Overall I would recommend it for those who like: Quiet, fast Responding, smooth action, and comfortable keys with a solid built keyboard.",4,1,2020-5-13,1,1,0
"I love the sound these keyboard makes when I type.  I love the rainbow configurations.  I even like the mouse enough to put up with using a wiremouse and have retired my poor warn out Logitech Anywhere MX wireless one in favor of the mouse that came with this keyboard.  I'm not a hardcore gamer so I don't know if it's particularly good for that, but I find it a pleasure to write with (I do a lot of writing).  I especially love the media functions.  Being able to just use the function key and f8 to skip to a new song on spotify without having to alt-tab out while writing is A+ to me.Overall, very  happy with this keyboard.",5,1,2019-6-2,1,1,0
"I liked this mouse/keyboard set originally. I am a little leery about products that come from overseas but I figured, for the price, why not? Well, I should have listened to my gut because we got a bad product. The keyboard works great...(It's a keyboard... not hard to do) and the mouse functioned pretty well while it lasted, except less than 90 days after I purchased it died, total death, I played with the wiring up near the USB port by moving it with my hand..it flickered on for a brief second before dying, so I can only assume the wires came loose like oh-so-many ear buds I've had before... This is sad because this mouse was almost always in the usb port giving no reason for there to be unwanted stress on the mouse.Edit: In response to my review and my complaint, Amazon shipped me another keyboard/mouse combo to replace the broken mouse, they shipped it one day so that I have already received the new product and am shipping the faulty combo back, this is great service on the part of Amazon and even ChallengerUSA (the distributor), whom also offered to replace the item. I can't say this new set will change my opinion on Redragon products, as I was unable to contact them and they seemed to have nothing to do with the replacement of this unit, but Amazon and ChallengerUSA deserve 5 stars.",3,1,2015-12-26,1,6,0
"You wont go wrong for the price. Just like anything else that you buy through Amazon Prime this guy came to my home quickly. Everything was packed up nicely and well protected with air bags covering the actual keyboard and mouse packaging. Granted, this isn't going to be the best keyboard mouse combo out there but for the price, I don't think you'll find anything better out there. The red lights looks good on both the keyboard and mouse but aren't too bright. The mouse wheel has a nice feel to it but does require a little bit more umph to move it then other mouses sometimes need. The mouse definitely isn't small, but I only have normal size hands for a guy and my handle cradles it just fine. If anyone out there with small hands is wondering if they can use this, my wife (with VERY small hands) says that she really likes how comfortable the mouse is.  The 3 dpi setting are nice and luckily with where the button to change the dpi settings is at, you're not going to accidentally hit it. It's also nice for me switching to a lower or higher dpi depending on the game that I'm playing or the program that I'm using. If you have any questions or anything I'll be happy to answer anyone's about the keyboard or mouse.***EDIT*** I've decided to update this review. After putting in about 200 hours of CS:GO using this keyboard and mouse set up, I feel like I've put it through it's paces. The only issue that I've come up with was binding keys to the mouse buttons 4 and 5. They're a little tough only because instead of using the options menu I had to manually type in the binds through the console. Other than that I've had no issues. The Keyboard is a bit on the louder side but not much more than any mechanical keyboard albeit much louder than a chiclet keyboard would be, but that's to be expected. As far as how noisy it is when I'm gaming, since I'm really only using WASD a bit of the shift key and then tab, I haven't had much noise. The most important thing is that the wife doesn't get annoyed with the noise so there's that. 200 hours later this is still a 5 star extreme bang for the buck keyboard/mouse setup.",5,1,2016-3-7,1,4,0
"Initial findings.I love the “soft” brushed coating on the keyboard it feels nice and over all is very comfortable ergonomically when typing. The keys have good resistance, footprint and travel. They feel like I’m actually hitting keys vs buttons like some smaller keyboards.",4,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
"For a budget, this keyboard is awesome. Enough said! It has customization, but you can't necessarily customize each key's LED independently. You can cycle the rainbow, but it looks pretty rough because the LEDs appear to be in groups, rather than independent. As a result, customization is also limited. The one CON about this keyboard for some however, is the keys are slightly stiffer than one may like for fast typing or games. Other than that, for the price, it's great and will make any kid (or adult!) very happy. You get what you pay for, though!",4,1,2018-10-15,1,3,0
"This is a good backlit keyboard for the price, but the included mouse is a painful nightmare. The keyboard has several colors, pattern options, and brightness level that let you choose between something flashy or less distracting. Letters, numbers, and symbols are large and easy to see clearly when illuminated. Keys are a good large size and very comfortable to type on for a long time, without being loud enough to bother other people a few feet away. The biggest downside is that the keys are too dark to read with the backlight off, so you will always need the backlight on to use it. There is also a very bright red LED for the Num Lock indicator that you may want cover with a piece of black tape. Overall, though it is a good backlit keyboard for all day typing and better than expected for $40-$50.The included mouse, however, is small and anyone with larger than average hands will have to be clutching it wiht your whole hand tightly wrapped around it. The mouse also doesn't slide easily on a mousepad so you must also hold it tighter and push harder to move, which made my hand and wrist ache almost immediately. I tracked down mouse customization software on the manufacturer's website and still couldn't make the mouse any easier to move. The mouse also has bright red lights that can't be customized or turned off to avoid distractions or eye strain.",4,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"While I wasn't expecting much from a $30 KBM RGB combo, I was shocked to find what I did when I opened this particular order. The package was shipped in the manufactures box, so when the delivery personnel left said package on my front door step, any one and everyone could see I what I ordered, and could have stolen it at any moment. On top of that, the box was slightly damaged, from shipping understandably. Upon open the box was where the real troubles arise. The Keyboard had smudges on it, as if it had already been used by a semi pro gamer who lived off of mountain dew and cheetos. Easily wiped off, but still concerning. The topper, was the product sticker on the bottom of the mouse. It looked like it had been peeled by an anxiety ridden worker in the process of packaging. That, or was adhered with watered down elmers glue. The last thing I noticed, was the logo on top op the keyboard was upside down. I'm not sure if thats the design of the keyboard, but it definitely looks out of place.As far as functionality goes, the keyboard and the mouse seem to work just fine for now. The mouse being weighted with all the weights, still ended up being lighter than my old, unweighted mouse. The mouse has one led mode. Red. While the keyboard has 6 modes, all accessible via the FN key and the key cluster above the arrow keys, as well as utilizing the arrow keys to adjust pulse length and brightness.",2,1,2019-12-17,1,1,0
"so if you want a cheap but useful keyboard and mouse then you couldn't go wrong, everything works, but the lack of software and having to use the keyboard shortcuts to change colors is a slight annoyance but you can get use to it. Searched their website for the software for the model number but no luck. Everything seems to work the way it should, the only complaints that i have at this time, (granted i just got it today and its only a few hours old). The number line and the f key line only lights half of the keys, by half i mean you can see the keys all the way across but half of the key is not illuminated. The mouse seems to work great, when switching DPI functions it works the way it should but i did notice that it tends not to retain the setting from time to time. All and all good functional keyboard and mouse with its little issues.",3,1,2020-5-7,1,1,0

I didn't think the lighted keyboard feature was really something I'd care about, but finding that I do like it a lot.  I also like that I can change the color and make it blink if I want.  (Actually just picked one steady color and stick with it.  That works for me.)  I like the feel of the keyboard too.  So far it's been a delightful surprise.",5,1,2020-6-18,1,1,0
"I wanted a replacement keyboard and mouse, not for gaming, but for regular use.  This keyboard response is completely useless, it’s slow, I have to type 1 key at a time.  The online instructions mention a speed adjustment which does not seem to do any good at all and no amount of adjusting of Windows keyboard options solve the problem entirely.  I have no idea what any keyboard with slow key functions are good for but I am going to have to rerun this.  Do not buy unless your a gamer and you have the need for these interferences.",1,1,2018-3-13,1,5,0
"As others have warned, it does not come in other packaging, so porch pirates have it easy to see what's inside.  The keyboard is plenty bright and colorful, and the user booklet has simple instructions for how to set the color you want.  After reading other reviews, I made sure all the keys work - so far so good. The mouse, however, is complete fail.I didn't see others complaining about the mouse but I have no right click. None. I removed the new mouse and am using my old one since it works fine. There is no product support, no software to download or install. This is a nice looking set but between the absence of packaging and support,  it's buyer beware.",2,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
"I have become spoiled with the backlit keyboard on my laptop, so when I found backlit keyboards, I was ecstatic. The keyboard has a decent feel, and the travel distance is reasonable as well. I love the different color options and being able to select the color and brightness level for my working conditions. As a writer, I find this a decent keyboard with a better feel than the keyboard on my laptop.The only complaint I have is every time you turn on your computer, the keyboard defaults to a rainbow blinking mode. Yes, it’s easy to hit the FN key + Home to scroll through the color options, I just wish it would remember the last setting.",4,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"I purchased this keyboard and ended up returning the first one because I thought it was a defect. It kept randomly turning off on all function levels. Not just lighting. It completely would not be usable at all. I could not have a 15 minute typing session without it turning off at least 6 times. I got the second one only to find out it did the exact same thing. My pc is new so I know it was not that. I checked Redragon online support. DONT BOTHER. 4 email support tickets and a month later, 2 keyboards and I have returned all of their product. They do NOT answer you about any of their product when you have an issue. I purchased another keyboard mouse combo and it has been running smoothly and perfectly since. Save yourself the headache and do not buy their products. Look neat, doesnt work worth a crap and zero customer support. FYI they only got 1 star because you HAVE to give one to post.",1,1,2019-2-12,1,2,0
"Good feel, full keystrokes. Not silent but fairly quiet, not ""clacky."" Adjustable backlight is nice; as is the mouse speed adjustment. Note that every time you restart the computer or reconnect the devices, they default to multicolor keyboard fading in and out and the mouse on the slowest speed. There is no memory for your preferred settings. Unless you like these defaults you will have to change them each time. The mouse color does not change with the keyboard. It is always red, always fading in and out on a 4 second cycle. You can disable the ""Win"" key, very handy for gaming. There's nothing like being in an intense game scenario and accidentally hitting the Win key which minimizes the game. There is an indicator light when it is turned off. There are also indicator lights for cap lock & num lock. I like the feel of the keyboard and mouse and am glad that I purchased them.",4,1,2018-10-5,1,0,0
"For such a cheap gaming combo you can't beat the price for the quality you get. The extra two buttons on the mouse are pretty reactive and have a nice click to them. The keyboard itself is pretty nice with some programmable buttons and some extra media buttons that I haven't really gotten to use since I mainly use this on my PS4. The cables are braided which is insane to see given the price. One thing however that I never thought I'd say is that I wish there was more paper work telling you more about the buttons and features on the keyboard, for example I had to find on my own how to control the lighting effects which is another nice edition that isn't necessary but shows the quality of this product. Also maybe more instructions on how to use the media buttons on the keyboard. Either way this is a pretty nice bundle for only 30 dollars, can't beat it.",5,1,2018-8-20,1,1,0
"12x  <------ that's the result of using the ""right Shift"" key on the corresponding keys listed — it doesn't work (won't produce !@X). Strange, because the keyboard malfunction seems so limited to these few keystrokes.

"Fantastic for the price, the keys are quiet and the colors are vibrant but not distractingly bright. My husband uses the mouse and I use the keyboard for pc gaming we have no complaints. Both respond nicely and all the buttons work appropriately. They keyboard is a perfect fit for my hands, and would probably work well for kids. I imagine the color options would appeal to kids as well. Overall a good purchase.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,1,0
"This keyboard is okay. It doesn't quite work for me for typing. The row of keys inline with the keyboard (crtl, win, alt, FN, page, etc.) are too big and my palm hits them while typing, causing erratic things to happen. It's annoying. My hands are broad but my fingers aren't very long. I would imagine this wouldn't be an issue for people with long fingers. The keys aren't too loud, kind of a muffled click. This keyboard works well for gaming; I've been playing Fortnite with it and have had no issues. Another review mentioned that the keyboard light settings don't remember your last setting every time you restart or wake your computer from sleep. This is true. It always defaults back to the annoying random rainbow flashing mode. It's easy enough to change, though. The backlighting is nice and illuminates the letters through the keys. I haven't used the mouse, but it is the type with a compartment door with weights inside. My son used to have a mouse like this - after being dropped a few times, the weights were always falling out. I set the mouse aside as an emergency backup. I wouldn't buy this product again for a general use keyboard, I would look for something where the ctrl & function keys aren't so big. For strictly gaming, this is probably an advantage.",3,1,2019-3-15,1,0,0
"This keyboard and mouse feels great, and has an elegant feel to it.  Very comfortable with the keystrokes and moving the mouse around.Note:  The mouse moves a little slow if it doesn't update via the internet.  Once an internet connection is established, the drivers automatically update, increasing efficiency.  I don't know why that is, but the overall feel of these two make me give it 5 stars anyway.",5,1,2020-7-9,1,1,0
"Pretty darn great replacement for MSI product. You can save a lot of money with this one. Keyboard is great and the mouse is decent, (I like larger ones so really the mouse is fine for average sized hand), but it makes no difference, because both work very well and responsive. Anyone who works with computers you need this keyboard. Because the worst thing to do is not get something that was designed to be responsive and last long. Wireless is probably the worst way to go, connect the cord and stick with USB style keyboard and mouse (PC tech of 20yrs advice).Also, gaming products were designed with durability in mind. Plus you can make the lights any color.",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"It does what it's supposed to do, although I have some complaints about the keyboard.1. The right shift key is sticky.  In my case, that means that it feels like it's cushioned when I press it, keeping it from making that trademark keyboard clicking noise that we all know and love, and make it take noticeably longer to return to the ""unpressed"" position after having pressed it. It makes me think of those doors with air pistons of them, where no matter how hard you close or slam it, the piston slows it down to keep it from slamming hard. This may just be a lubrication issue, or perhaps something wrong with the rubber, but it's still annoying. Even worse, the only way I was able to remove the shift key to try and see what the problem was, was to remove the CTRL key under it, so I could have space to insert a gift card under the shift key to pry it up.  After that, the CTRL key is also sticky. This makes me further suspect lubrication issues.  But this process leads me into my next complaint",3,1,2019-1-1,1,0,0
"I am a Mac person and happily pound on Mac keyboards all day.  Recently I bought a mechanical gaming keyboard which I really like.  But with Covad and working in the same room as my wife, it was too annoying for her while on calls.  So I bought this S101 as a quiet replacement.  Overall the keyboard layout, features and button layout are nice.  But overall the keyboard feels a bit too plastic y (yes I know its made of plastic) and unless you press right in the middle of a key, the keys feel like they are rubbing making for a harder press, which is my main gripe.  I'm using the keyboard now as I type (lacking another alternative) and I am a bit annoyed with it.Even after 4 days of using it, I am often reminded to be annoyed.",3,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"Overall, this is solid for the price. It is a multi-use PC, with some gaming and some work/other entertainment for my son, so I wanted full size with media keys in addition to the RGB backlight. He loves it. The lights look great in the dusk, night and dawn, but are a little dim for the middle of the day. The extra long braided cable for the mouse is excellent, as is the powdered finish on the mouse. It won't get slick in a sweaty palm during intense gaming! My one big complaint is that they made the plastic on the USB connectors so thick that the keyboard and mouse can't be plugged into adjacent USB ports on my motherboard. I may shave them down, but this seems like a serious design fail for a set that comes together. I have 2 usb 2.0 ports specifically for keyboard/mouse, but instead I have to use one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.2 for these...not good.",4,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"The keyboard is a membrane type, the keys can be a little hard to press down (not impossible of course). It has several backlighting settings (7 colors blah blah blah I'm sure you can read the product data. The backlighting works without other software). The cord to the keyboard feels like it could last a while.Personal opinion (like all of this...): the mouse is the best part of this combo. Its a 6 button mouse (2 ""regular"" mouse buttons, 1 button on the click wheel, 1 just above the click wheel that changes the DPI settings, and 2 buttons in the right hand thumb location.) The mouse has red lights that breath by default (though you can turn this off through somewhat glitchy software that works 1/2 the time. But your hand is covering it when you use it...so it'll probably be ok). The USB cord has a braided jacket that feels like it can take alot. It has a weight system that you can customize (personally I use 1 of the weights for a lighter feeling mouse). I have large hands and am right handed, and I like that the mouse fits my hand well. The thumb buttons on the mouse are closer to the desk than some other mice I've used. I use a photo manipulation program often with it and the ability to set DPI higher at the click of a button is pretty useful. It also comes in handy when you run out of space on the desk (because sometimes I have papers, electronics projects etc. that are also on the desk)",4,1,2019-1-14,1,0,0
"We bought this keyboard to replace the original equipment that came with a new desktop. My son found this one and really liked the backlight design, the mouse functions, and the keyboard layout of this unit. Set up was easy: just plug in and you're ready to go.  Unfortunately, the keyboard stopped working today after 5 months of use. Keys were sticking and causing issues with log-ins and page navigation with multiple keystrikes. My son inspected the keyboard and found that a plastic piece had broken inside the case, under the keys,  causing the malfuntion.  Customer service helped us out tremendously, but I just wish the keyboard had worked longer than it did.",4,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"I bought this keyboard because I like the color lights....I thought it was unique.  Had the keyboard less than a month and the main feature (colorful lights) stopped working.  Now I can barely see the keys and just ordered another keyboard....but not this type or by the same company.  By the way.....forget it if you think there is software to configure the keyboard because there is none.  And you're given the illusion that the mouse also changes colors, it does not.....it stays red.  Also the manufacturer is in China.  Why is that important.....because products coming from China may be lower in cost....but they are inferior in quality and you'll actually spend more money.  Gone are the days when good quality electronics came from the USA and Japan.  Buyer BEWARE!",1,1,2020-8-26,1,1,0
"I really like the RGB lighting on both the keyboard and mouse. I did, however have to update the windows drivers after installing the them. Only half the keyboard would work until I did a manual updated through the control panel. Then had to restart my computer. The mouse worked perfectly but, I think the keyboard is better suited to gaming than the mouse. The way the mouse buttons are shaped they really slow down the button pushing compared to other mice I have used. But they do work flawlessly and look nice and are quiet when pushing the buttons. I only gave it 4 starts over all because of the mouse design and had to manually update the windows drivers even though it was stated as plug and play.",4,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
Received these on August 13 2020. I bought two of these at the same time. Both worked great up until a couple of days ago. September 24 2020.  When one of the keyboards wouldn’t function properly. It started off that the “P” key wouldn’t work. Then the “K” key. Now there are several keys that won’t work at all. I’ve tried everything to get it to work. With no luck. Now I’m just waiting for my other one to go out. 😡 it’s been too long to return it. So now I am just out the money spent. I bought the higher dollar gaming keyboards. Hoping they would be faster and better. But the cheaper ones seems like the ones I should have went with.The mouse still works as it should.,1,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"I bought this for a friend who is on a tight budget and wanted some RGB. I didn’t expect much considering the price, but this mouse and keyboard are pretty solid.The keys have some resistance and feel similar to my Romer-G’s. I am currently using the Logitech G413 silver which I highly recommend. I expected the keys to feel like a cherry mx red, or just no resistance at all. The caps don’t feel super cheap either and when pressed they are quiet. It has very limited customization with the RGB backlight. It only has “wave” mode but you can control the speed and brightness. You can also turn it off.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,1
"So, first thing I noticed after I plugged in this little blighter is that it is very bright, and active. The RGB mode is going all over the place. Found how to use the FN key to adjust the settings (in the manual), and wanted to do the same for the breathing on the mouse. All the manual says is to download the software. Hrmmm... ok. Go to Red Dragon Site and look up the S101 keyboard and mouse set. Nothing. Spend the next 10 minutes figuring out the mouse is the M601 and finally download that software. Now I can adjust the lighting, not to mention the DPS and macro settings on the mouse. Nice! All in all, not a bad set. Also, no warranty card came with my keyboard and mouse set. Guess I'm just up a creek on that one.",4,1,2019-8-30,1,1,0
"I got it today in the mail so I could use it for my Xbox to get the feel of gaming on a keyboard and mouse again. So far today I used it to play fortnite & minecraft. It has an amazing feel, the mouse especially with the two buttons on the side actually got me to build better on PC servers considering it was my first time playing with a mouse and keyboard on fortnite lol since I’ve always used controller. The lights are pretty cool as well, and how you can change how they turn on or whatever.Honestly if you’re looking to start gaming and getting a feel of being on PC, this keyboard is actually the one as a starter. It would be cool for the mouse to have multi-color lights to it but none the less, this was worth buying.",5,1,2019-3-17,1,1,1
"The right button on the mouse doesn't ""click"" anymore. I game pretty heavy, but dayum, just over 4 months and it dies? I really should contact customer support and see if it can be replaced but I am so not motivated to deal with it. Maybe I will, maybe I wont. If I do, I will update this review later.Update: I do not have a ""contact seller"" option and apparently it is past the return date. I had a 2 year protection plan, I called that company and they gave me the run around. Perhaps if I had the time to deal with their BS, then I could EVENTUALLY receive a replacement to this trash, but I will not waste any more time and will buy me another mouse from someone else.",2,1,2015-8-4,1,3,0
"I'm giving this a 4 star rating becuase the keyboard is a great design.  It is super useful when trying to pickout keys in a dark room.  It has a perfect assortment of lighting options and overall, I'm pleased with the purchase.  It gets used mostly by my 13 year old son.  He is a heavy keyboard and mouse user with the games he plays. The only issue we've seen is the mouse went through a squeaky period where the plastic buttons created an irritating squeaking noise when he pressed on the right mouse click button.  It must have been an issue with spacing and the speed he was pushing it as it went away after a few weeks of use. I'm guessing a little wear on the friction point made it fit together better. Keep in mind he is a heavy user and rates himself on the number of clicks he can do in a second. As such, wearing it through that break-in period may take longer for some.",4,1,2018-6-10,1,0,0
"I really like the mouse. No complaints there. I like the button to quickly change DPI depending on your needs/laziness.The keyboard wasn't so great. It wasn't complete mush, but it did feel mushy. But the biggest drawback? No volume keys! I suppose this is my fault for not noticing before buying, but having volume keys on a multi-media keyboard seemed like such an obvious feature to have I didn't bother looking. You have to use an fn key to change the volume, but not only that, the second keys you press are F2 and F3. That's right, you need two hands to change the volume!",3,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"This keyboard and mouse combo is a killer deal for the price.  I bought this as a temporary keyboard and mouse as I'm doing a gaming PC/music production/game development work horse.  I was extremely surprised and impressed with the mouse especially.  I play CSGO mainly (as it is all I can run on this laptop) and I usually don't fair all that well, I'm usually 1:1 on my K/D ratio and within the first 3 games I went well over 2:1 and a significant jump in overall kills using this mouse and keyboard combo.  Point being I haven't changed anything about my game play and so from a scientific perspective, this mouse and keyboard setup made all the difference in the world.  The mouse fits well in the palm of your hand and has a nice texture for solid gripping during long game sessions.The accuracy of this mouse is incredible for the price, actually not just for the price, it's just that this is an incredible value for the money.  This may end up being a permanent keyboard and mouse for my gaming PC after all.",5,1,2017-11-8,1,0,0
"This keyboard is amazing.  I was hesitant to buy another backlit keyboard after receiving one from a different company last year that was subpar. The lettering wore off quickly and rendered it useless. I was drawn to the design of this one and decided I would give it another try and I am so glad that I did. The colors are vibrant, the patterns and solids give you a wide variety to choose from. I spilled coffee into the number pad, but after a quick dry out it was still fully functional and as reliable as the first day I bought it. I'm happy with this one and when/if it wears out, I would be happy to purchase another just the same. It has nice key spacing and a satisfying clickity-clack when you type.",5,1,2018-9-18,1,1,0
"Ok, well this being my first somewhat gaming Keyboard, I LOVE THE FRAKIN thing.  It is a elegant design with smooth yet coarse design I love using this keyboard in the dark with the ""breathe"" effect as I game.  There are a few things that should be added to increase its level of awesome.  First of all, the mouse is a 5 level mouse and not a 5 color mouse.  The mouse itself is well designed and smooth to the move, however, I would have liked the option to change the color to the key board.  Second, I would suggest that up increase the length of the risers on the keyboard.  For me they are a little short.Once again, it is a smooth keyboard that reacts very quickly and is well designed.",3,1,2018-5-29,1,1,0

I expect little more from the keyboard. My fault for not returning it after I open box and saw how cheap it looked, but as I said I have other products from this maker all good.  first thing the mouse started to fail cause you to click multiple time to make it work.  so in less then 4 months I had garbage.

"The keyboard is totally flawless, responsive, good color, love it. The mouse I have one small issue with. The majority of the time it's fine, but every once in a while if you're not holding down the RMB just right, it won't register. This is a problem in fast paced FPS games where ADS is game changing. There's been a handful of times I was on target, only for my mouse to force me out of ADS, and I have to hit it again, not always a big deal, just be aware. Overall, well worth the price.",4,1,2020-5-13,1,1,0
"I find this keyboard as nice as any I've ever had. Keys are right where my fingers expect, easy to push, quick response (I type ~70 wpm), which a quiet but noticeable click - which is ideal for me. Keyboard had a nice weight and deep footprint (front to back), so it feels stable on my lap. The RGB lighting makes it very easy to use, even in subdued lighting, and it's pretty as well of course. I figured I'd just switch to single-light constantly on, but instead I find I really like the rainbow pulse effect. Even the strain relief seems solid - which is where some kbds have failed in the past.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
For the price it's worth it. The keyboard and mouse are so far holding up well and mouse works fine without installing the driver's. The only bad thing I come across is that sometimes when I press keys to rapidly the keyboard can't keep up and doesn't register it.Update:,4,1,2017-12-3,1,3,0
"Every now and then i try a different keyboard to spice things up, and I am always disappointed in every keyboard that is not this one. I have tried all the fancy loud clickers, flashy lights, and boojie name brands and this bad boy red dragon still is the champ. There is no competition.... The only thing about it is you sometimes have to get physical with removing key caps for cleaning, but it just shows you the good build quality.No need to fear, the mouse is also amazing quality. Similar to the keyboard this thing seems like it should be 75 shamackaroos. After 2 years of working from home and gaming she is still good as new mechanically. A very small amount of the red paint has worn off from some sweaty gaming sessions but it adds character. Be warned, the only thing is the braided cord for the mouse may get tangled, but that comes with any braided corded mouse so no hate here.",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0

Its got backlit and raised/clicky keys and it was on special price so I thought why not? After using it for a few days now, I have to say I am completely satisfied. Key are clicky but not loud enough like mechanical keys to bother people in the next room. Key color tints can be changed easily and look very nice in a dim lit room.

Then last week I'm told to work from home so I bought another for my new ""home office"".... not even thinking about the fact that I have an iMac at home. Many features don't work with Mac and you have to reprogram keys from your System Preferences but the basic functions work that way. That's just a simple warning for Mac users if you're a dummy like me, but this really is a great keyboard and mouse that I enjoy using, which is why I ordered a second one in the first place!",5,1,2020-3-24,1,0,0
"Mouse works fine and feels really good in the hands. Programmable buttons are always a plus. They keyboard, however, is a different story. Like many have already said, the general quality feels extremely cheap and even after 5 days of use, a few of the most commonly used keys are sticking or becoming unresponsive. Fortunately, the the mouse alone costs $30, the same price as with the keyboard combo, so it was basically included for free. But, as the price should tell you, don't expect anything of quality from it. It's basically the keyboard equivalent of a McDonald's kids toy. But like I said, it's technically free with purchase of the mouse so if you're just looking for a good quality gaming mouse at a low price point, this is a pretty solid option. If you're looking to kill two birds with one stone and actually keep the keyboard permanently, you're going to be disappointed.",4,1,2018-6-26,1,0,0

I personally like a higher tilt on my keyboard and even with the tilt legs out it just sat too low, i ended up purchasing an item to hopefully replace the notpad i have under it now to give it tilt. The second thing was is the keyboard is slightly more compact than a regular board. However the keays are smooth and I love the feel when you push them. It was very easy to adapt to typing and using this keyboard.The mouse...I LOVE! I love the texture and scroll , just wish it was purple instead of red :p",4,1,2020-5-26,1,0,1
"Nice and comfy keyboard and mouse set. I like the slightly pastel glow and color settings the keyboard comes with, and the mouse has a button built in to increase its DPI if it's moving too fast/slow on the current computer. The only issue with the keyboard and mouse is it does not remember your previous lighting or DPI settings - so it'll reset every time you turn it back on (for the keyboard, that means flashing colors). The mouse also seems a little janky on certain surfaces, but is generally not too bad (I have a different mouse I use normally so this is not a major issue for me).Overall, I found it worth getting this and paying slightly more than a previous cheaper colorful keyboard/mouse set which had problems galore.",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0

Very smooth feeling and comfortable to use as well.The mouse.... I ended up buying a Logitech cordless G602 that I use instead. When I did use the mouse that came in the bundle it was ok. Felt pretty cheap, very light, decent response. All the buttons worked it just felt like it was gonna break in my hand.

The functionality of both the keyboard and mouse is great!",5,1,2020-10-1,1,1,0
"This keyboard is actually pretty nice, despite it being so cheap. The backlight is programmed VERY intuitively, which I appreciated. You can see all the shortcuts for changing motions and colors on the keyboard with the function button + another key. This isn't a clickety-clack keyboard, so it actually makes for really soft typing, which works great for a more quiet environment. To be honest, it actually has more shortcut keys than my HyperX Alloy Core RGB keyboard. My HyperX keyboard doesn't have a sleep shortcut key on it, but this keyboard has lots of shortcut keys on it, such as: power, brightness, sleep, volume control, search, etc. I gave this keyboard to my wife when I got my HyperX keyboard and I have to say that even she likes it. It's absolutely worth the price and I never had any issues with it. Give it a try if you want a decently nice keyboard for a good price.",5,1,2019-4-7,1,0,0
"Great keyboard, only problem is you guys sent it out in the original box so there was nothing protecting the keyboard. The bottom right corner has a piece missing so, there is damage. I wouldn't have a problem with damage if it was delivered in a protected box, a bit careless. But, other than that everything works perfectly and is a great keyboard, lights up beautifully. I'm amazed at the quality for how cheap it all is. 7/10 (would've been 10/10 if you just sent it in an actual mailing box, seriously everyone could see what the product was on our front step, careless).",4,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0

"I didn't rate it for gaming, as I haven't used it for that, but I love this keyboard.  The feel of the keys and the click are really nice.  My daughter likes it so much that she now uses my computer just for the keyboard!  The mouse is great too, although it took me a minute to figure out all the different buttons on it.  I mainly do school work, so I needed a much more ergonomically designed keyboard than my computer came with.  This one more than fits my needs.  My son is extremely jealous, even though he got a different gaming keyboard for Christmas.",5,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"As a writer, I'm at a keyboard most of the day. I'd read an article about gamer gear being the best for ergonomics, so I started looking at keyboards and mice. Then I happened upon this set. My friends are jealous and I find myself turning it on just to stare at the keyboard (I use a laptop, so it's hooked up to a USB extender). The keyboard currently at an odd angle, but I find that this angle seems to work best for my long ago injured wrist. The mouse is just comfortable. I can't say enough good things about this set.",5,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"UPDATE: The seller replaced the keyboard for me. The process took a little while. But the result is a MUCH better keyboard. All the keys now work as they should. I would like to thank the seller for taking the time to make this right. If this were the first keyboard I received, I would give this a 5-star rating.I love the look of the keyboard. The lights are dazzling and look great. However, many of the keyboard keys DO NOT work. I have so frustrated, that I have had to remove the keyboard and start using the one I had prior to this purchase. A shame, too. I really liked the keyboard. ;-(",4,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"Good entry level gaming gear. Both the keyboard and the mouse have fast responses (no lag time or missed keys/clicks in my experience and are comfortable to use. That being said, they have the minimum of hotkeys/buttons/shortcuts/etc. that a gaming setup would cost. If you're just getting into PC gaming it's a good starter set to see if more complicated sets would be right for you.For the lighting-up, the keyboard is as advertised but the instructions are terrible. You'll have to play with it until you figure it out. There's lots of different options and many of them have different speeds, or you can turn it solid on or solid off. The mouse is only red, only on. I'd prefer it if they both were the same options, but you can set the keyboard to match the mouse.",5,1,2019-6-11,1,0,1
Product came quickly and functions well so far but I’m giving this 2 stars for 2 reasons. First issue was this item was a Christmas gift for my son and arrived on my door step in just the product box. Not only did my son see it the box was beat up and looked like trash but thankfully the productwas not harmed. My second issue is the description. I’ll take part of the fall on this because on one part of the description it does say the mouse is just red lit. The upper part of the description where I stopped reading says this is an RGB mouse when it clearly isn’t.,4,1,2019-12-24,1,1,0
"This product started to experience issues in less than 3 months of purchase. when contacting the seller about it they proposed a replacement that would have put me 2 weeks without a keyboard. (ship it to them and wait for them to process) As anyone who has to work from home knows, you cannot go 2 weeks without the ability to use a keyboard. I determined I needed to order a new keyboard and requested a refund. Due to the sellers policies they were unwilling to work out a reasonable refund request since it was outside of their 30 day window. Highly unsatisfied and would not recommend this product.",1,1,2020-9-1,1,1,0
"I am a gamer type, but I honestly bought this because I wanted a separate keyboard and mouse for my work from home setup, but something other than a 20 dollar logitech setup / combo.  I have been using this combo for my home office for several months now and I've found they are both very comfortable for my business use.  Are they as fancy as my Razor gaming setup?  No, of course not, but neither do they need to be, and again I really like the feel, particularly of the mouse which as sort of a ""power coat"" type finish to the top.  I'm weird about my cleanliness, and I hate the feeling of sweat or oil on my hands as I work the keyboard / mouse, the mouse being made of the material it does; does great works to combat my personal oddities.  As far as gaming goes, I haven't really tried them out, but I see no reason not to use them for that purpose especially if you are minding a personal or household budget.  Great buy!",5,1,2019-6-6,1,0,0
"While the keyboard and mouse are fine as a dumb keyboard an mouse this product gets no support from Redragon.

I spent days looking and comparing this product with other similar ones. I have never purchased Redragon products prior so I was a little skeptical.  I ended up going forward with it given the amount of positive reviews.The S101 is well worth the investment and it doesn't break the bank.

"I've gone through numerous keyboards lately, and the touch of the keys just hasn't felt right.  I like keys that aren't too light as I'm always accidentally hitting a key I didn't mean too.  Or keys that are too short and hard to feel.  This keyboard has a nice semi firm feel to it, not to soft, not to firm and the clicking sound is just right also.  I don't like loud keyboards, but I do like to hear it and this is perfect.The colors look cool at night and I like the adjust ability of the light levels, patterns etc.  Had my concerns about such an affordable keyboard, but I'm super happy now.",5,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
"I like the keyboard, except like others have said, there are no drivers and the back lighting is interesting, but without any software to control what it does, it's annoying after a while. You can slow down the speed and adjust the brightness with the FN key + the arrow keys, but that's about it. The mouse is another kind of beast. It kept freezing my entire system every once in a while making gaming really annoying. Maybe it's a defective mouse, but I don't care because it kept freezing my system and I went back to my Logitech mouse. This is what I get for not staying with my brand. I'll probably use the keyboard for about a year, go back to Logitech and use this as a back up. I'm never buying anything from Reddragon again.",1,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0

"Ordered this keyboard and mouse combo because my old HP keyboard from 2002 finally perished due to a Diet Dr Pepper spill (RIP). Was surprised they shipped the keyboard with the label directly on the product box and not with a proper Amazon style box but oh well e____e I can't say much on the mouse that came with the set (I think it has adjustable dpi up to 3200 and has a few programmable buttons but doesn't have a finger rest so I avoided it) or instructions (hint: there were none lmao) HOWEVER, this is the best keyboard I've ever purchased at such a low pricepoint. The keys aren't loose and have a solid feel when you depress them and the rgb colours are vibrant and illuminate well. There are many different colours you can set the backlights to which is neat. The whole board is light but feels solid and not cheap by any means. If you're looking for an inexpensive replacement keyboard with anti-ghosting for casual use or even average gaming then this is it. Look no further. You have found a hidden gem without hype marketing overpricing it. :)",5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
"Overall, quite satisfied.  Great tactile feel (I'm using it to write this review!), many light settings to please you, and niceWarning: I deducted 1 star, because for the life of me (a) it was hard as heck to find the Windows 10 drivers for this guy, so I could program the buttons for power, dimming brightness on the screen, etc., (b) the hibernate / power button will sleep/shut down my PC, but won't wake/turn on the PC.  (c) When I purchased it, the description said it had macro buttons that I could program to work with my game--no such buttons on this guy (buy it's big brother for $20 more if you want that).",4,1,2018-8-4,1,1,0
"(When I get everything in the studio finished and sett up I will make a Video review)Like the Title says, this is a awesome and cheap combo packaged. it types really nicely and and has good ergonomics, this feels like a $200 keyboard and not a $30 combo kit. the mouse is also good, it has two minor annoyances, one being the sensitivity, it's either not a lot or A LOT. the other is that you cant change the color on it, it always glows red. keyboard has plenty of RGB functions.  I'm not to bothered by this seeing RGB is not my main thing. I just wanted a really nice but cheap keyboard and mouse combo.",5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"Great feel for gaming, LED's are colorful and helpful when doing any task. I do not know much on how to program it outside of the default macros. I keep mine on the solid rainbow color and it looks great. Keyboard feels like there is a slightly deep click, for gaming if you need to click faster, it may feel a bit off, but I got used to it fairly quick and now the clicks feel smooth. Been using it for about 3 months and all works well. I am unsure if the mouse has programable dpi, but the middle button under the scroll wheel allows for a dpi adjustment. Overall great product!",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"I like the way the keyboard feels. I like how my wrist can rest against it nicely. It was a gift and he does enjoy it very much. I got it cause it's made specifically for gaming. He's starting to game on the PC and he loves it. The mouse works perfectly as well. I recommend it! Especially If you're just starting to game on the PC, or if you're just wanting a great quality keyboard. Came undamaged and functions properly. Though, there's a rating for sound quality.... mind doesn't make noise. Maybe I haven't figured that one out yet though. I've also been using for a little over a month with no pieces falling off.

"For the price, you cannot beat this keyboard and mouse. I use this for my teleworking business computer and appreciate the ability to set a static back-light on the keyboard (in multiple colors). My kids like the different rainbow displays. My only recommendations for improvement are that the palm rest area be extended out far enough to allow the user to rest their palms and that the keyboard was a little bit wider with a little more spacing between the keys (feels condensed a bit). Believe both of these would help with the ergonomics of the keyboard.",5,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0

The highlight under the standard gamer keys (qwertasdfgzxcvbm) is actually a huge help for those of us who never learned actual typing & have to play in the dark since our spouse is all about ""GO TO BED!""My only gripe and loss of one star was this vendor's shipping method. They simply put a shipping sticker on the keyboard box. No shipping box or $0.99 bubble envelope. I arrived home to find a Dragon keyboard box laying on my front porch that may as well had a sign that said STEAL ME! And since it wasn't packed in anything protective, the box took quite a bit of a beating in shipping. I'm only lucky the keyboard & mouse survived to my porch.",4,1,2019-9-16,1,0,1

The keyboard and mouse were pretty much plug and play with no compatibility issues whatsoever. The ""feel"" of the keys is really great; better than most standard OEM keyboards that come with new computers. What's nice is that not only is the key ""bed"" backlit with changing LED colors, the keys themselves are backlit and easy to see at night. The mouse ""dragon"" also lights up red, which my son likes. Both the keyboard and mouse seem to be very durable and high quality. My son has been using it for a few weeks, so time will tell as to how well it holds up. But for now, he's very happy with it, and so am I!",5,1,2018-12-27,1,0,0
"Great keyboard, the texture of it feels nice and cleaner than my last one that originally came with my ibuypower pc. I am moving into the gaming and editing industry and this keyboard and mouse helps me move significantly faster and more accurate than my last setup. The commands to change the colors are easily memorable so you don't have to have the manual nearby. My only dislikes is that the left shift key feels a little tough to push down with your pinky when you are gaming but granted I am not an avid gamer and it is a minor issue and another dislike is that the mouse does not change colors and it is only set to radiate the color red which kinda of puts the idea of my ideal setup. Hopefully this will change in the future but other than that it is a great buy and I am very pleased with my purchase. No regrets here.",5,1,2020-6-11,1,1,0
"I purchased this since I am now working from home and do a lot of computer work. I wanted something to break up my day and have fun with, but still needed something functional. The key strokes on the keyboard are so soft and smooth, it is quieter than my regular ergonomic keyboard. The lighting to it is very nice and there are so many ways to have it. It does take a while to learn which key functions to use to get it to where you may want it, but it is a very easy instruction manual. Since I am not using this for gaming I will say I am really glad that I did read the reviews and purchase this. I did have an issue with one of the keys sticking, but when I contacted the seller they responded immediately and were ever so happy without question to replace it. I contacted Amazon and after scanning my return had my replacement keyboard sent out the same day and received it the following day. I will definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a great keyboard and will see what other items they may have to assist with my new home office.",5,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0

Super easy to adjust the lighting for the keyboard and I even like the key binding in the manual to adjust the volume etc. I was a little disappointed you can’t change the color of the mouse from red, so it doesn’t match the rest of my set up but it’s such a small thing and can be replaced! The mouse itself is great, easy to adjust the sensitivity and with side buttons for gamers- though I’m sure you could bind them for other projects too?Comfortable, nice. Maybe could do without the logo printed twice, top and bottom, but otherwise I’m super happy with this purchase. Definitely recommend!",5,1,2020-6-23,1,1,0

The lights are bright, but there is no way of having it fix to a pattern or color I like. And there is an issue with the mouse that it freezes for 2-3 seconds when clicked and moved. Pretty, but not really good for FPS games and the like. It'll do for now, but I won't be purchasing Red Dragon again.Edit: I did give up on the mouse after all. I read online to uninstall and reinstall whenever it starts to lag, and after the 4th time, I've had enough with it. Also, I thought it was a stylistic choice, but the period key is a solid black square. That's how it came. Definitely would not recommend.",1,1,2020-5-12,1,1,1
This is a good combo especially for the price. The only thing I don't like about it is that the lights on the keyboard and mouse don't turn off when the computer is put to sleep. Keys aren't as loud when typing as my other similar key style board. Construction isn't razer quality but it is still good enough where I would buy again and we already have another Redragon keyboard which works well. All in all if your not too picky then I would recommend it.,4,1,2015-12-30,1,9,0
"Purchased a Laptop and needed a keyboard and mouse and bought this combo because of the price. I regret it now because I have honestly used the keyboard a handful of times and the space button gets stuck now. The feel/quality of it also feels really cheap. The lights are cool and work flawlessly and so does the mouse. I have no issues with the mouse, it's actually really nice and use it every time I use the laptop which is maybe once a week and with the feel of this mouse, I think it will last a fairly good amount of time. It has weights that you can customize to your liking, change the speed of the mouse with a button, and two buttons on the left side of the mouse.My honest opinion is it might be a good entry set for new gamers or someone needing a cheap set but with hopes of upgrading in the near future. I wouldn't count on the quality of the keyboard.",2,1,2019-1-14,1,0,0

I’m using it on a Windows 10 desktop.*UPDATE: Amazon quickly sent me another replacement but it also had the same issue. I searched online and found the solution. For some reason, in combination with this keyboard, Windows OS changed a keyboard setting to control the mouse with a keypad. After turning of this setting, both Number pads on both keyboards worked.

For me, it was the 'c' and '3' keys, which are aligned vertically. The manufacturer seemed interested to help solve the problem, but if their initial QC or testing is that bad or non-existent, I'm afraid that getting a new one would probably not fix the problem. The unit wasn't DOA, and we figured out the problem outside of Amazon's normal return window. I went to a slightly more expensive, but mechanical (outemu blue, I think) switch based keyboard.

I also like how you can easily adjust the weight of the mouse. I only have two critiques that are rather petty but still brought it down a star.First, the mouse does NOT change color. This is 100% my fault for not noticing before purchase, but it's rather annoying because my computer follows a green theme, and I have a red mouse that clashes with my color scheme. Also, any time the keyboard or mouse is unplugged or if I shut down or restart my computer, the keyboard and mouse completely reset.

At most, for the Keyboard you can change between Built In Preset light colors, using the FN key on it, and for the mouse it has 4 built in mouse speeds you can switch between with the button on it. But without the program and drivers, you can't Customize them in any way, and the programs for the other products won't work, as they detect and specifically work for those products.",1,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"I got 2 of these for my sister and I but we've only been using them for a few days. We both game (not heavily) and thought the colors would be cool. It's a nice keyboard, nothing outstanding but worth the price. Connecting was super easy, plug and play. Instructions for changing the colors was easy. The mouse doesn't change colors which kind of sucks but for the money it's a decent mouse. If you're on a budget then it's a good option. I'll update on the durability after we've had them a while.",5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
"Update 11/29/2016:It's been over a year. The keyboard is dusty, but all my keys still work, the LEDs are still great. The mouse scroll button has started to slip a little bit the past month or so, but still functional. Great keyboard still. With the key cap remover, it wouldn't be hard to clean it up.",4,1,2015-7-24,1,1,0
"Amazing back lit keyboard with edgy features and color customization. Mouse clicks have nice matte/velvet-like, gritty finish which I found very cool. Cord length is good. Only drawback is that I wish the backlit would be brighter. Also every time I turn on my laptop the color scheme defaults to rainbow which I change by pressing FN + Home to arrive at my favorite color (green seems to be the brightest). These points aside,  amazing keyboard and no regrets.",5,1,2020-9-28,1,0,1
"If you frequently plug-in and unplug (due to travel, for instance ), the mouse cord weakens and fails at where it joins the usb plug. Annoying waste.I also wish a compact, led ;lit keyboard, with spill=proofing, as this has, were avalanche, with only the characters  lit, again, as this one, but no grid light leaks, as is dumb, dominate market design., currently.",2,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
"I would have paid the full price of the bundle for the keyboard alone, it is by far the best keyboard I have ever owned. There are lots of different light options, the only complaint is that there is not different brightness modes. The keys are all very responsive and feel good to press. Very nice for typing and long gaming sessions because of the palm rest at the base of the keyboardThe mouse is not the best, you can't change the color of the mouse so it doesn't match anything unless your other lights are all red. The mouse itself is good build quality other than the scroller which feels a little loose to me. The customize-able weight is also nice. Also to make full use of the mouse (including the lighting and DPI settings) you have to go and download the software for it off Red Dragon's website. The wires on both the keyboard and mouse are very high quality. Will not wear out anytime soon. -1 star for mouse not being as nice as the keyboard.",4,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0
"So I like this keyboard, I do, however the mouse is a different story. While the keyboard is flawless, the mouse is unresponsive at times, and honestly the constantly changing of colors on tbe mouse is annoying, but that's more a preference issuse.",3,1,2019-10-27,1,1,0
"Bought this keyboard/mouse setup for my little brother's birthday. He's always been wanting a gaming keyboard/mouse like mine, and I put some scrap parts in a case and got him a little PC setup going. He love's the keyboard and mouse, only complaint is the brightness could be a little brighter, but hey you can't win it all with this kinda price. Can't beat it, I would recommend for any beginners, or you just simply don't wanna pay $200 for a keyboard lol.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"My son wanted a gaming keyboard.  While this one is not a mechanical keyboard/mouse, it performs and it looks nice doing it.  LED’s are important for kids and this has them.  I believe the mouse is only red lights, though the keyboard has many rainbow settings.  All good and he’s deadly in fortnight as a result versus his wireless keyboard that would lose connectivity from time to time.  Wired is king for gaming.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0
"The keys are stiff and needs some force to press.  I play a lot and my fingers get tired of pushing the keys.  Wish there was some way I could adjust key pressure.  The game I play uses 1,2,3 and E.  Unfortunately there is no way that I know of to modify the keyboard to make these keys easier to use.  Navigation keys don't work for the game I play.  Even though the picture portrays the product accurately, I was hoping that I could make some keyboard modifications to make it easier to play my game.  I gave it a 3 because my fingers get so tired of pressing the keys.  Maybe someone with stronger fingers won't have the same problem.",3,1,2017-1-6,1,1,0
"I actually like this keyboard, wish it had a few more color option's, but it's an older keyboard. It feel good, has good weight to it, not sliding around. It's well made, been using it 6 month's now about. Heavy usage everyday about, and nothing's worn off. I like the mouse as well, only not the red light you can't change to match the keyboard, I just shut it off. The mouse is also well built, though the top buttons' fellt a bit flimsy and cheap, they are not, meaning they haven't broken after hundred's of hrs of gaming. The adjustable weights' in it are a nice touch. It fit's my hand very very well and I don't suffer wrist pain's trying to use it like other cheap mice, nor with the keyboard actually. It's a good older solid product overall. I'm sure the newer model's are better and improved upon, but go Red Dragon!!",4,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
"Built a gaming PC for my sons first computer. It was his 10th birthday. This may not be the best option for gaming, but he has been very happy with t. Of course because it lights up, but he also like the fact that he can change the mouse dpi setting with just the click of a button on the mouse. He was also impressed with the removable weights in the bottom of the mouse. Overall it’s a pretty good keyboard and are very happy with it.",5,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
"I tried 4 different keyboards in this price range before finding this one. The first two felt incredibly cheap. They felt like they'd break after a month of use. The third was incredibly loud. This one feels sturdy, it's quiet, and the lights and extra function buttons are a nice touch. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a high-quality product in this price range. The mouse seems a little cheaper but not terrible. I gave it to my son and so far he likes it.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"This review is for the Vajra (the cheapest option) with the mouse. I was in need of a keyboard, any decent keyboard and came across this. Bonus it comes with a mouse! Almost a year later I have not been let down. If you are looking at this, chances are you are on a budget and want a good looking decent keyboard with mouse. You have found it! I really couldn't tell you the difference in what makes this one a great gaming keyboard as I've never owned one before but for the price you will not be let down. Easy set up and even after my kid spilled nail polish on it, it still works. Within the year I've owned it I have played MMOs frequently, daily internet usage, typed papers for classes and in the last 4 months very frequently played games on Steam. If you want to save money and aren't concerned​ with customization, fancy bells and whistles this does the job nicely.",5,1,2016-2-11,1,1,0
"I had one of the red dragon mice as a quick replacement for a while and it quickly became my main gaming mouse. Thought it didn't last but maybe 2 years of gaming before the right mouse button broke, but being as I liked it enough I wen't ahead and got the combo. I like the keyboard a lot as well and the feeling of the buttons is pretty nice, so if you are on a budget or just looking for a good but cheap gaming set up, I'd go with this.",5,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0
"The Keyboard and mouse are a nice set.  The keyboard seems to be well made and sturdy.  The only issue I have is the key push (the distance the key travels when typing) seems to be longer than most keyboards I am used to, I am still trying to get used to that.  I have not used the 2nd set of WADS keys (Set on the lower right of the keyboard) as most games I play require the use of the 1-5 keys, F keys, and Q,E,R, SHIFT, and CTRL keys.The mouse also seems to be well built and is relatively comfortable, even for extended use.  The 8g weights inside add a little bit of weight to the mouse, which doesn't seem like much but I like the little bit heavier mouse.  The 2 thumb buttons are nice, although I like the one closer to the back of the mouse as it is located to all I have to do is quickly tap it with my thumb to use it.  The thumb button in front of that one take a little adjustment of the hand to use which takes a little getting used to, especially when playing a faster paced FPS game.",4,1,2015-8-17,1,1,0
"Pros: The keyboard has a great feel for typing.  I did not get this board for gaming.The glowing feature works very well and perfect for evening when I work on projects. The choice of colors is nice, except that it does not include yellow.",5,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"The keyboard and mouse combo is great for the price. the key feedback and bounce back are great and durable. i've been enjoying the colour changing keys and how you can program it. the mouse only has the one colour option, just blinking red - you don't notice it when you're using the mouse but the mouse itself is great - no hiccups or skips, and the speed changing is wonderful so switch easily when you're playing different games with different play styles.Sometimes the mouse stays on even when the computer is shut down. they keyboard key lights turn off and sometimes the mouse does too. other times the mouse stays on though so at night it can get annoying.",4,1,2018-10-26,1,0,0
"Bought this keyboard and mouse when my son was 10. He wanted to be a “famous YouTube gamer”, so I decided to invest in his dream. 😫 2 years later, he is now more of a Fortnite/GTA/Roblox junkie than a YouTuber - but the keyboard and mouse are going strong!! And he is SUPER rough with his electronics, so this speaks VOLUMES about the quality of this product. (I can’t tell you how many headsets we have run through over the past 2 years.) Both devices still light up, and there have been no issues with functionality. All the keys on the keyboard are still in tact, no sticking, even the characters on the keys are still fully visible. My son complains about the keys being too loud during gameplay, but not much else. The mouse has full functionality as well - the scroll wheel still tracks, all buttons still work. I wish the mouse color could be changed, but that is just a personal preference. Excellent purchase!!!",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"I needed a keyboard and mouse that I could see in the dark as I am awake at night occasionally. The keys as well as the mouse have such a light touch to them. The wrist guard/handguard  is a wonderful plus. And the colors, oh the colors; the main reason I picked this set. I can see them so clearly that I don't have to turn on all the lights in the room to use my computer now. No lights means my roommate (who sleeps with the door open) will not be disturbed in the night. Also the keys are so quiet; another plus. I am so glad I purchased this model!",5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
Really happy with this keyboard. Super soft touch and quiet when typing. Really cool design and color changing to how you want. Mouse has almost a light grain of sandpaper feel for extra grip and prevent slimy ness from hands being possibly clamy. Definitely recommend as a starter keyboard mouse set or even for work preferences,5,1,2019-10-26,1,1,0
"Note: It may be amazon’s delivery since all they did was throw the frikkin thing from their truck. It had some dents on the actual box and covered in dirt.The keyboard on most keys worked. The whole thing powered and lit up properly.

"We've only had this for one day.  I bought it for my grandson.  He absolutely LOVES it!!  I even like it.  The mouse is very nice and fits his hand well, but it would probably fit most hands just fine.  The lights are really pretty, but not too bright so it wouldn't disturb anyone else in the room.  It's perfect so far!!  I can't believe we got this for such a reasonable price.  I hope it holds up well and my Grandson gets a few years of use out of it.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat!",5,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
I have not even had this thing for 24 hrs hooked up to my Xbox one 2 of the keys I use don’t work when I first got it it worked fine but last night I noticed 1 key not working and just now a second key stopped working this keyboard looks good but don’t work for very long,1,1,2020-8-8,1,1,0
"I liked this keyboard to start. Good brightness behind the keys, good feel and style. But within a few weeks, when I hit certain key sequences while holding shift, it would not 'shift' all of the keys. So ""shift so.."" should produce ""SO"" but it would always produce ""So"". It's hard to think that is a physical defect since the rest of the word would typically be in caps as well. Ultimately it ended up being enough of a hassle that I had to replace it.",3,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0
"After looking at RGB keyboards from reputable brands, I noticed the REDRAGON combination set to be one of the more purchased sets on the lower budget spectrum. I liked the weight, style and design of both keyboard and mouse; however, when I received my set, I'm questioning if I should have payed the extra money to get set from a more reputable brand.KEYS - half of the keys on my keyboard function perfectly. I have no problems with any of the smaller keys, such as the ""q"", ""w"", ""e"", ""r"", ""t"" ect. or other keys that are of this size, but any of the larger keys, such as the 0, Enter, and + keys on the number pad , the ""shift"" keys, backspace and backslash all have different resistances or don't function properly. They are difficult to press, or do not register when pressed. Half of the time, when the backspace character is pressed the ""="" sign is entered because of a poor manufacture molding. - Poor quality control, should not have left the factory. Refer to the picture about the fused keys.",2,1,2019-10-21,1,0,1
"I recently built my computer, and needed a decent keyboard and mouse to accomodate the performance for the games i run on my computer.  The mouse seems to be very crisp, and adjustable by removing weights (i removed about 3 of them).  It has a very comfortable feel to it, and the buttons are positioned in easily accessible areas.  I have never been much of a fan of the wireless mouses for gaming, and that is why I am very content with this wired model.  The keyboard has relatively quiet keys, that don't seem to have to bad of a ""clicking"" breakin point when depressed.  The surface of the keys have a nice matte feel to the touch, not slippery feeling.  The lights are great touch, and not overpowering.  It truly was plug and play with no issues.  My only complaint is the return key is vertically narrow instead of having the horizontal length, or the reverse ""L"" design and I often miss the key when going to hit return.  This isn't a deal breaker though, as I can often just reach a little further and catch it.",5,1,2015-4-20,1,1,0
"Reddragon keyboard and mouse could not be any better for what I need.I tend to stay up pretty late for gaming or for school. In either case, I may need to be using the keyboard and mouse.  Going lights out has never been easier since all of this lights up. There are different modes which is fun to play around in, but I stuck with solid red, matches my PC anyways. Of course there are brighter colors for better visuals of the keys. The mouse ""breaths"" red, as if the Dragon were asleep and ready to breathe. All of this is quiet. Every button to click and it is not loud and obnoxious, perfect.",5,1,2018-8-7,1,0,0
"I’ve loved this keyboard so far. It seems to be made from some great material on the keys. My last keyboard, the space bar would not press down well. This one presses great. The keys by far are the best part. There’s some soft leathery suede maybe? Like definitely not hard plastic (maybe it is) but I love the fee of the keys.In terms of function I’m super basic so I don’t even use or hook up all the bells and whistles.",5,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
"Got this keyboard and mouse combo after having not one, not two, but *three* wireless keyboards in the span of a couple months that all had various issues with lag and missed typing. I resigned myself to a wired KB and mouse and figured that would be it, and I picked this one based on positive reviews and price.What a pleasant surprise then to find this keyboard has very comfortable keys and quieter keystrokes than any of the wireless models I bought. I like the lighting (plus options to change it) purely as a means of seeing it better when typing in the dark. And the mouse is a solid addition as well.",5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"I’m about to throw away this keyboard set I bought last year and replace it with an upgraded corsair k95. The mouse was really starting to annoy me and I had to bang it on the desk a few times to get it to work because it kept lagging. It did hold up fine for awhile and the lights still work, I’m just disappointed I could not reprogram the colors to where I want it. My first impressions were good, but eventually; down the road, this is a cheap poorly made keyboard and I am not satisfied with it. Buy corsair and logitech instead.",3,1,2020-5-10,1,0,0
"The keyboard itself is fine, and there are multiple light settings. The thing we wish we had known was that the keyboard resets to the default setting every time you turn your computer off and on, which for us is several times a day. I contacted customer service, and they confirmed this was the case. There is no software for the keyboard.Regarding the mouse, just know it is huge. We are used to a much smaller, more ergonomic mouse, so we're not sure if we're going to continue using it or not. Also, the default setting is a crazy slow dpi, so every time you turn your computer on you have change it. There is supposedly software for it, but it is extremely difficult to find, is not in the box, is not listed anywhere on their website for this model, and I had to contact customer service for them to send me a link to it. I haven't tried it yet, but maybe that will fix the inability to save settings other than the default. Again, no software exists for the keyboard. This is only for the (giant) mouse.",3,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"Not only did this product not come with the software or any links to any software, their website has the wrong software listed for the keyboard. The mouse software does not allow changing the two side keys to keypresses except via the use of a clunky macro system that can't replicate the effect of a keyboard key on the mouse. The keyboard also does not have proper rollover - I've found many examples but the most striking one is that you cannot use LCtrl+LShift+Esc to open Task Manager on Windows! I've already requested a refund from Amazon.If those issues don't bother you, however, the keyboard looks very nice and the mouse is adequate. I haven't had nearly enough time to test its durability, but I wouldn't expect much from Redragon at this point, considering the last items I purchased from them each had non-critical failures within two years of purchase.",2,1,2018-12-26,1,0,0
"For the price, this keyboard mouse combo is decent and works as intended. Keys and clicking are louder than expected but that doesn't bother me as much since I wear headsets. I don't like the keyboard LED lights are always moving, never still. You can only change the frequency of how fast they move. The middle enter key gets stuck once in while, which is unacceptable. Another annoying issue, once you turn off the computer, the mouse DPI resets to the slowest option. It would be nice to have the last preference saved. Not a bad keyboard mouse set, but didn't expect such issues. Decided to keep the item regardless. Next time I will invest in a better keyboard mouse set.",3,1,2019-3-22,1,0,0

Typing on it is a nightmare, except the backspace key is actually the proper size compared to the one I use now.It is NOT like the mechanical keyboards most people expect, and it was a complete waste of money.

"I looove the rainbows and the different colors, they're so much fun and not distracting. The mouse is okay, looks very cool, but the wire seems pretty stiff to me, which makes it difficult to navigate. Also, it may just be me, but the random flickering lights the mouse gives off is distracting to someone who is very easily distracted. The keyboard is awesome and my only complaint is that sometimes a key will stick. I get the feeling it's the function of the keyboard rather than a physical sticky key because it's not any one specific key, but any one I might use. It'll stick and carry on, such as fffffffffffffffff or kkkkkkkkkkkkk. If I click another button it'll stop and I can delete it, but that's a bit annoying. Other than that, it's a very cool keyboard. I like rainbows.",4,1,2018-10-3,1,0,0
"Very torn on this product ill just talk about the keyboard the mouse is absolute crap like many said in other reviews the mouse is kind of just a throw in and the quality represents it. The keyboard however isnt that much different its very light and cheap feeling and to me wasnt very comfortable. The media keys don't work, and to change the rgb is a fn+6 button mess it also doesnt save your settings. Im not the type of person who usually knocks stuff like this and says hey just save up and buy something better but just save up and buy something better. This product is really not worth your time unless you are on a extreme budget.",3,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0

"Directions in English please. I'm not trying to be mean, but it should be clarified in the product information that there is no English directions which is pretty important when you're trying to figure out the led light functions.

Wasn't until i did my own research to find a few others with the same issue. Would love to rate this 5 stars but the work it takes to repair something that should of been checked before shipment isn't worth the trouble.Not only that the mouse itself is flimsy made with some sort of plastic, its a beautiful mouse sure but all i care about is it working properly, wish the last guy posted the video about repairing it would definitely help some people out.",3,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0

"decent mouse and keyboard for a small price of entry. I originally bought this for my xbox, to help enhance certain games, having access to keyboard/mouse over controller. It has now made its way as my budget keyboard for the PC setup, and i have had zero issues. The mouse allows for a diver to be installed on pc to finetune everything, but is not necessary. I had this running on my XBOX for 2 months before PC, zero issues. Keyboard has 6 RGB modes, can be accessed with FN and the insert/home etc keys. very handy",5,1,2020-7-8,1,1,0
"I just wanted a back lit keyboard with white lights to make the keyboard keys are easier to see, but this keyboard has 6 colors which flash on and off like a Christmas tree - which just plain stupid. There are 6 options to control the blinking lights - 5 options to make the lights blink in a more annoying or less annoying fashion, and 1 option to turn off all lights - which does not result in a back lit keyboard. If I were a pimp this might be fine, but since I am a CPA trying to concentrate on my work, the keyboard is completely ridiculous.

Although i know red dragon did copy msi for this one, it's a really good clone for a sub 15 dollar mouse.

"Since these items are bundled together, I'll rate them together. Both products are fully functional and are a step up from the basic $20 Logitech equipment I was using before. The red LEDs are also nice, since red doesn't make my room uncomfortably bright while sleeping.The mouse has good sensitivity and a nice texture in my hand (something I didn't notice advertised, but am pleased with). It'd be nice if I could make it a bit heavier, but the weight isn't bad. The mouse wheel is firm and only makes noise if I spin it very quickly. If I were rating just the mouse, I'd give it a 5.",4,1,2015-11-6,1,1,0
"I use this for work.  I'm older, so it gives me the feeling of being on an Old School Keyboard.  I like to feel the keys being pressed!  I have purchased 4 of these for myself, for each of my office locations and have gotten so many compliments that several people have asked me for the link, so they can purchase.  The mouse is comfortable and responsive.  I love the colors, puts a little fun into being behind a computer all day at my desk.  And you can't beat the price!",5,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
This is a excellent keyboard for gaming we got it to play on a PS4 . This key board is excellent you can change just about everything the way you want it to be. We used it on a laptop and it works very . The mouse is awesome also. One thing about the keyboard is that the movement on the pa4 is excellent it has changed the way he plays and had made him a better player,5,1,2019-3-10,1,1,0
"So I have used this keyboard for around 6 months now, and it seems to be working fine. I remember the keys being mushy on the first day, but they are fine as of now. Only problem is some of the bigger keys like  shift and space are really inconsistent with how they feel to type with. The rgb is great for working at night. However, one issue with the rgb is the keyboard software wouldn't detect the keyboard in my case, so customization was limited. The mouse software did work though, and all mouse buttons are able to be remapped. Another cool feature is drain holes on the bottom of the keyboard in case something spills on it. The mouse also has a nice braided cable. Speaking of the mouse, the clicks and two extra buttons are really clicky and satisfying. The dpi button in the center really helps with increasing the sensitivity on the fly. Generally, good value considering the price.",4,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
"Cheap and lacks features, no software to control led or config. Product can't even be found on RedDragon's website for this model. volume control requires a function button to use, this isn't a ""Quick"" button action. Very disappointed.",1,1,2020-6-23,1,1,0
"Seems pretty nice so far, but the ""thumb"" buttons are an absolutely terrible nusiance for left handed use in gaming. I had to turn those buttons off in-game.The keyboard looks great. The cables are quite sturdy.",4,1,2019-11-24,1,0,0
For the price this is actually pretty good.  The key board is by all means pretty with the lights and works well.  The mouse is comfy and fits my hand well.  The lights are bright and vibrant colors with many different colors and modes to choose from.  If you don't want to spend the money for a fancy mechanical keyboard I would definitely recommend this one.,5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"Editing my original review- When I first ordered this product, the keyboard came to me with a small defect in the Ctrl key- it stuck randomly. After posting my original review, the seller was in contact with me almost immediately and offered a replacement keyboard, which after some discussion I accepted. To their complete credit, they were willing to work with me and ship the replacement before I returned the old one, since I didnt have a spare on hand to keep using. And the replacement keyboard works perfectly! The mouse has been great since I received it as well, very solid product.My only remaining small gripe is that the lighting defaults to scrolling rainbow color when you turn on your computer- which is somewhat distracting. It's fixable by a key press or two, but it'd be nice if the lighting of the mouse and keyboard defaulted to the same color (the mouse is a slowly pulsing red color).",3,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"The big thing I want to say, that for the price you get a pretty good looking RGB keyboard that seems to be in pretty decent quality and could be help up to par to any other decent RGB keyboard in the $50 price range. The keys feel smooth to touch, and although I don't how they will feel overtime they just feel great to type on. The little wrist holder feels nice to use I just wish the little designs on it weren't there but it's still good! For some reason the logo and the top of  the keyboard looks different than in the images shown on the page, but it's not a big change and it looks good! The mouse is a pretty basic mouse in the price range, has all of it's buttons and an amazing braided color. The coolest thing are the little weights in the back that make the mouse feel good and weighty to use, and not floaty like plastic mouses you'd expect to see in the $30 price range. You can take the weights out if you want and get the feel you want but I feel like all the weights are just nice! All and all, a perfect bang for your buck product and if you got the cash, I think this is a pretty safe buy. I have had no issues yet, but will update this review if I get any. (The mouse pad I shown on my mouse image is not included, it's my personal mouse pad)",5,1,2019-6-25,1,0,1
"I wanted to like this but mine came defective from factory.  J L and I keys wouldn't work. Checked drivers. Nope, they didn't even work in the BIOS when I tried which confirmed the hardware was defective. It looks gorgeous and maybe I just got unlucky with this one in particular. The box arrived in perfect condition and it was well packaged which makes me believe there was not too much effort in quality control. I ended up buying an Eagletec mechanical keyboard which worked just fine for me. I like Redragon, so I hope they do a bit more to make sure their peripherals leave the factory fully functional.",2,1,2017-9-18,1,1,0
"Keyboard does not feel good, very mushy and cheap feeling. The mouse feels just as bad as the keyboard does. These both look nice but I'll stick with my G110 and G402. They were inexpensive. Maybe this would be good for a child who doesn't know any better. Going from my current KB and mouse these felt like a huge downgrade. Would not recommend except perhaps as a starter mouse and kb for someone on a tight budget.",2,1,2019-8-14,1,0,0
Purchased for my son as a Christmas present.  He started using it after Christmas 2019.  He does not use it all the time and now the mouse stopped working after just 2 months.  Keep on looking,2,1,2020-2-24,1,1,0

"After tons of research I bought this keyboard because I work in the wee morning hours and needed to be able to see my keyboard without turning on lights and disturbing the house and I lost the USB connection for my previous mouse somewhere in my couch. The keys are quiet and the lights are perfect. You can change to any color in the rainbow or just leave the whole rainbow, which is what I settled on. You can have a pulsing light as well, but I don’t use that because I find it distracting. All in all I am very happy with my purchase.",5,1,2018-8-31,1,0,0
"I was a little worried at first about the ""you get what you pay for"".... at this price I was sure things would have gone bad by now...I have had this set for 4 months now, keys are nice and quite.

"Specifically the ""f"" key. A couple of other keys don't work either, But that one annoys me the most. You know how much you use the ""f"" key when typing? Ugh. Has a Good glow to it, wish it was brighter. Very lightweight design and the keys are definitely comfortable. I get pressure hives and I barely notice it when it's sitting on my lap, it's that lightweight. Heavy duty wire cord for the plug, and the keyboard is very easy to learn and use. Just wish my buttons all worked, this was my Christmas present. In light of that, I do hope that my keyboard gets replaced by Christmas, I'll up the stars to five and update if it's done by next month. :)All in all, a good board. Hope they fix it, because I love Redragon!",2,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"I got this because it is not healthy for a kid to be hunched over a laptop screen with a small keyboard and no mouse for hours on end.  Since school may very well be at home the full year, this is totally worth the money.  To complete the ergo set up, we raised the screen to eye level.  It took some getting used to, but it is a much better setup.",5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"This keyboard has great color with the backlit keys and functionality. Took a little while to realize there are not any downloadable programs for this keyboard and mouse like their other products but everything is built in to the keys. Worked right away after plugging it in without having to wait for drivers. The mouse has great weight to it with the option to customize it with the small weights and the braided cord on it is tough enough to last with the wear and tear that comes from travel and use. Keys are also very quiet and don't wake up my wife like a mechanical keyboard alternative would.I didn't give 5 stars just because I know there are better products out there but for the price, i don't think this combination can be beat. I'm very happy to use these for my first PC build as a way to save some money.",4,1,2018-3-26,1,0,0
"Pretty good for the price range. Weird to have a smaller mouse, my last one was about 1.5x bigger and had more buttons.

"The keyboard combo I am reviewing is the Redragon S101 Gaming Keyboard Mouse Combo. First, I was disappointed with the delivery of the package, and why only 4 stars and not 5. It was meant to be a gift and it arrived in no package at all. It arrived in the actual keyboard box with the address label slapped on. I was so shocked to see it delievered like that, anyone could have walked away with it! One side of the box was crushed and we had to make sure the mouse was in there and still working. Alright, moving on...my nephew loves this keyboard and I do too! The keys are soft pressed and a joy to use, it is lightweight but robust enough where it doesn't look cheap. The backlight worked as soon as we plugged it in, hence the plug and play claim. The mouse is also smooth, responsive, and fast. I am not sure if anyone else encountered this, but we were unsure of how to change the backlight colors, we thought it did need a driver but found through sheer luck that to change the colors and variations use the ""FN"" key and press the insert, home, page up, delete, end or page down keys. As well as using the arrow keys and FN adjusts the color intensity and the frequency of the flashing. All in all, I do recommend the keyboard! I am even getting another one for my husband cause he loved it :)",4,1,2019-3-22,1,0,1
"This a pretty nice keyboard and mouse set. I have been using it for 6 months, I am a pretty avid gamer and have had no issues, the keyboard is solid, multi colored, progammable patterned keyboard is really nice for playing in the dark, and has a nice tactile feel when pressing keys very quite and smooth, the mouse is weighted for a customizable, solid feel, comes with assorted weights so you can remove them to get a balance that suits you, I personally really appreciate the  quick dpi selection button just behind mouse center wheel, each click runs through 4 preset dpi speeds depending on how quickly/far youd like the mouse to travel when you move the mouse,  for quick twitch games like shooters the higher speeds allow the cursor to travel across the entire screen with just a slight motion, where as the lower settings are great for rpg games or web browsing.",4,1,2019-2-26,1,0,0

Granted I've only had this for a month or so but it has held up to my gamer habits pretty well. I found I couldn't give it a full 5 stars due to how awkward the shift button is to press due to where the key is centered making my fast typing a little slower at times. I don't really use the right shift so this might be a left-handed kind of thing.I have not used the mouse yet (it's a backup mouse) so I can't comment on it's functionality yet but I'm sure it's of good quality if the keyboard is good.,4,1,2019-1-9,1,0,0
Honestly for the price this keyboard and mouse are unbelievable. Don’t expect a 100 dollar set but it’s really nice. It has a nice feel to the keys and mouse. And the plastic used is off good quality. At no point did any of it feel cheap. And the LEDs are great! Son loves that you can hangs the keyboard color at anytime by just pushing a button. If you are looking for a nice keyboard and mouse with LED lighting just buy it. For the price and features it’s no competition.,5,1,2018-8-29,1,0,0
My son ordered this item for his desktop. He has been very pleased. He likes the mechanical action and the light are a bonus that can be customized.

The wires were plenty long enough for his setup and the product functions flawlessly.,5,1,2018-10-30,1,1,0

"This keyboard works well but there are a few things that I don't really like are: (1)The mouse can only be red and is not color changing like the keyboard (2)The keyboard is a little flimsy and seems to have a slight upward arch in the middle so it doesn't sit perfectly flat on a flat table. You can push on it near the edges of the plastic bezel and it will flex a considerable amount. I don't really notice this while typing though so it's not that big of deal (3)The Num Lock, Caps Lock and Win Lock LED indicators (top right corner) are always red no matter what color you change the keys to be. (4)The mouse LED ""Breathes"" or pulses on and off. I even downloaded the Reddragon Centrophorus Gaming Mouse configuration app but the only options are to turn the LED accent lighting off all together or adjust the speed of the ""Breathing.""

"Mouse wheel no longer works right, it slips when scrolling through things like like forum threads at places like Reddit and GoodReads. And this is after only one month, though one month of almost daily use. Other than that, a decent value for a decent price. Though once the mouse wheel stops working completely and I have to replace the mouse, I guess the value bit will be out the window. And I'm assuming since the mouse wheel runs on some sort of mechanical parts this slippage is only going to get worse. Oddly only does it when scrolling down, not up.Probably also not the keyboard to use if you're trying to write a novel or something, but that's not what this keyboard/mouse combo is designed for and that fact is NOT reflected in my rating. Just consider that a heads up. After typing 2000 words in one day in my (very much failed) NaNoWriMo effort this year my finger tips were actually irritated.

While light-weight and no advanced options, this thing plugged-and-played on Windows 10 seamlessly.

The keys on the keyboard have a nice mechanical/springy feedback feel to them (although packed in to a smallish feeling area). The mouse has performed excellently both gaming and desktoping. The nifty red lights tie the two items together nicely for a good look. There are textures on the buttons for the mouse to give some touch feedback. The mouse is a little small for the button features if you ask me, but overall, it's a great buy at $30. If you want a really basic wired accessory setup, don't be afraid to buy this.

I've always used the mouse for my laptop and I've had no problems until after this incident. There was no signs of life from the keyboard (no lighting), but the mouse showed signs, in the form of a constantly shining LED. It didn't do the thing where it dims and brightens. When I plugged in the mouse and keyboard back to my laptop, still no signs of life. Even on my PS4 it wasn't responsive. I assume I screwed up somewhere down the line so I'm just gonna buy another keyboard. It was good while it lasted.",2,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"Good luck searching for the option to have it in an Amazon box. My only issue is that it arrives without a box around it, so hopefully you're home because everyone that walks by can clearly see what you bought a keyboard. Other than that, it's nothing special. The space bar hits softer than the other keys and idk how I feel about that. Nothing sticks so far. The mouse is like the wire one you can get at 5 below, but with a stronger cable. Pretty colors, I guess. Cheapest keyboard that caught my eye.",3,1,2020-5-15,1,1,0
This is a decent keyboard and mouse combo if you are on a budget. The keys are membranes and so there are inconsistencies in the force required. The lights are now as customizable as I would've liked (there is no option for a solid color always on) but still it looks really cool with my setup.,4,1,2017-12-22,1,2,0
"I actually like the keyboavrd, if it worked. they keys feel good, I like the mouse (havrpe 5603 combo bought) the problem as you can see is evrevrytime you hit the ""V"" or  ""R"" key it types vr. I can actually spell quite well ;-) Number pad is same way double types 56, 89, and 23 for either of the individual numbers in those groups. fvrustvrasting!!!!!!",2,1,2017-12-14,1,1,0
"I built my first pc and spent a premium on parts to future-proof my rig as much as possible. However, this left little in the budget for peripherals. Luckily for $30, this Redragon keyboard and mouse combo was a good deal.Pros:",5,1,2018-9-7,1,0,0
"CONS:  I'm taking off two stars mainly because of the strange Enter key.  I think all of us use the Enter key quite a bit, and you have to stretch your pinky quite far to reach it.  I knew this going in so it's hard to blame them.  I'm considering using some program to make right shift the Enter key instead, which will also require having me to retrain my mind to press right shift instead of Enter.  The WASD keys seem to be lower than the rest of the keyboard and is most noticeable with the D key being slightly lower than the F key; but this is a minor quibble and is hardly noticeable.PROS:  I love the feel and the quietness of the key presses.  The mouse is decent.  The mouse clicking noise is a little bit on the loud side, but it's not a dealbreaker.  My small gripe is that I'd like the mousewheel to have more tension when scrolling as I like to feel the discrete positions as you roll the mousewheel.",3,1,2015-8-1,1,1,0
"Uhh, each individual key is lit up but the light does not completely illuminate the key. The mouse ergonomics are weird in that they spread your fingers WAY out, I could never get into a comfortable clicking position. The wrist rest needed to be rubber or something so your and doesn't slide off, making it harder to type and the return policy I still don't understand because they took 6.99 out of my refund to pay for ""The label printing"" which the UPS store drop off, that's usually free with my Amazon prime, doesn't cover for some reason? I am now 7$ poorer and the only experience I have is with a keyboard and mouse that I didn't even like...I found a better one suited to my needs.",1,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
Very first thing I did with this keyboard once I got online is to go to amazon website and returned the item.Keyboard feel is meh. Not better than a stock keyboard that come with computers. Lettering on keyboard is not bright. I am returning more for the feel of key click. Did not hookup mouse. Assuming mousse is doing what it supposed to do,3,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"Tried to use it.  Just can't get used to the keys.  The keys are physically smaller that standard keyboards.  For me, not where I expect them to be.  Wife, who taught typing to HS students, can't type correctly on it due to key size.  Keys are too small, too close to together.  For me or my wife.Is back-lit, but just keeps flashing a never ending color pattern.  See no way to control that, again, software not included in the packaging.  Went to their website, neither the keyboard, the mouse nor the combo show on the page.",1,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0

I've used it a week and I'm very please with mouse and keyboard.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"This keyboard has a soft touch and has very smooth action. The mouse is heavy duty, which it took me a bit to get used to as I was used to a very light-weight mouse.

"OK, works fine I guess, but I did not realize that it is slightly smaller than standard size. Annoyingly so. I find myself missing keys frequently. Also, look closely at the picture at the placemen t of the |\ key. On most keyboards this is above the enter key but on this one it is next to the enter key, between the ' and enter. This is almost a deal-breaker forme by tistelf. Keys feel like cheap membrane. Keys are wiggly and does not enhance touch typing. I know it's a membrane keyboard but I kind of expected it to feel like a higher end membrane and it doesn't. The mouse seems OK, no real complaints. It's probably going back. Yea, it was cheap, what did I expect?Typos intentionally not correctsed.",2,1,2015-7-8,1,1,0
"Keyboard and mouse worked initially, but within the first day the mouse stopped being recognized by windows on multiple devices. I've reached out to Redragon via their website for support but as of now this is likely to be returned.

"Space bar started making squeaking sounds after about 10 months of daily use. I don't bash the thing and I didn't spill anything on it, so I'm not sure why the durability is lacking.

"This keyboard is pretty sweet. It came delivered without any packaging. Anyone at UPS could’ve made free with it but they didn’t.

Just make sure to add gift wrapping or something so nobody will know what you ordered.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
Many of the reviews stated that there were only three LED lights. This new improved version must be very different than the older one. I purchased this as a gift for my son. He was blown away by the lighting on both the keyboard and mouse. He also really likes the feel to the mouse. I give this 5 stars!I almost returned it due to the reviews. I'm glad I checked it out myself.,5,1,2017-12-26,1,2,0
"I used this combo every day for about a year and had absolutely no issues with it. Until one day I decided to splurge and get a ""nice"" keyboard and mouse.

Overall if you are just getting into gaming and are on a budget I highly recommend this combo.",5,1,2019-11-27,1,1,0
I have only had this keyboard and mouse for a day now. I bought this after one of my toddlers dumped a cup of coffee in the my 100 dollar Logitech mouse and keyboard combo which I have had for about 5 years. This wasn't as upsetting as it sounds due to the mouse being on it last leg.I was skeptical at first for the price I wasn't expecting much in the way of quality but I'm actually quite impressed. The keyboard responds flawlessly and once you get the device driver downloaded for the mouse you can adjust the setting in it a lot to make it respond how you would like it too. If I have any issues I will up date this review but as of rate now for the price you can't beat it.,5,1,2018-12-11,1,0,0
"Need to hold down function key and press F2 or F3 to adjust volume.  Those should just be 1 button each.  And you need both hands to do it.  Very bad layout.

However, if you are planning to play some game I highly recommend NOT to buy this product.Keyboard does not work how it suppose to work it sometimes press random key by itself and leftshift does not work with other key just like how it shows on the video.

Finally I was able to buy it. I'm happy. But... It was missing the keyboard and the mouse.  My first option was inquire in local pc gamer shops here in Colombia. The bad issues were the high prices or the poor variety of products. After, my second and final option was inquire in amazon.com.  Fortunately for me I see this seller and I choose it. I buy it on August 30th and it arrive on September 5th. The price is good. In conclusion, it is just very good. Buy this product.",5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"Been using for over a year and still great performance. The lights are neat, the mouse reacts well even in FPSs such as CS:GO and various strategy games, and they still feel solid and look good. For their price, incredibly impressed. The wires have fabric and I use them for my labtop to give me a bit more control and range and I couldn't be happier. The alternative keys on top of the keyboard are also quite useful, just don't hold alt or ctrl with the arrow/WSAD keys or else it switches their functions in game.",5,1,2017-9-18,1,1,0

"I can't complain because it was a real cheap set. But there really isn't anything special about this keyboard and mouse. Its just a regular made in china keyboard that they put a few glowing lights on to label it as a gaming keyboard. There is no macros or anything gaming related to it at all. Very cheaply made, because after only 3 months of use, the springs under the keys are already worn and rattle after every push making it really annoying sound. the Mouse has a really bad lag for some reason, tried playing with settings in windows and still lag. So has to be the mouse. I left my keyboard at my other house, so this was okay for temp, but would not buy for perm. use.",2,1,2015-10-31,1,0,0
"I will just go ahead and start with the one ""con"" side of this combo. You can't change the color display for the mouse. Yup, that's it, and that is nit picking. The keyboard itself has an array of colors and a couple sequenced RGB patterns. I am not a heavy PC gamer but the games I have played using this keyboard; I have found no reason to complain. There are obviously higher quality keyboards and accessories out on the market but for the $ you can't go wrong with this. Has about a standard key stroke noise and without a basic wrist rest, it can get annoying if you plan on typing for extended periods of time without a rest. On that note though, what keyboard without a wrist rest wouldn't be taxing after a period of time. Nice, simple product with some flashy notes. Worth the purchase.",5,1,2018-8-7,1,0,0
"This keyboard is pretty with all the lights, but the keystrokes don’t register well, and my typing is seriously affected.. I have to type really slowly for it to register on the computer.  I will be returning.",1,1,2018-6-20,1,3,0

"This keyboard and mouse combo is a fantastic deal. The mouse is the Redragon Centrophorus, which is pretty high quality. It has removable metal weights in its body and customizable DPI. However, I had already ordered a Redragon Mammoth gaming mouse prior to this purchase, so my main concern was the quality of the keyboard. I was not disappointed. Although the keyboard is a membrane keyboard, the keys feel somewhat like those of a mechanical keyboard, making this keyboard a good choice for those on a budget. The activation force is around 55 grams, and the matte finish of the keyboard feels fantastic. My favorite feature of this keyboard is the texturing of the F and J keys, which makes it extremely easy to find the home row, even if this keyboard does not have backlit keys. With the package comes a keycap puller, which works fine but is not as robust as metal keycap pullers.Mouse:",5,1,2016-2-10,1,1,0
"Typing feels great on this keyboard, lighting options are fine personally, I imagine someone who like more customization would want more out of it, but I don't care about that too much.

"The keyboard is pretty nice. It’s a good value for the money as far as gaming keyboards go, so it’s basically just a keyboard that’s a little more responsive and feels nice to use. The mouse is a little bit of a different story, but it’s not too bad; even though it has a decent weight to it, it isn’t RGB, the wheel sometimes doesn’t work right, and the side buttons are accidentally pressed by my thumb all the time which undos pages on Chrome. I’d say this is pretty good for a beginner, but a better mechanical keyboard and mouse from the same brand would only set you back another $20 or so.",4,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"It works for what I need, and that is solid performance with no lag or disconnects. I am coming from using wireless and lately I have been having nothing but problems with wireless technology.While I don't like a mess of wires, I do like how the mouse uses a cloth shielded wire. The keyboard has keys that are comfortable to use, as they are indented and feel like an old mechanical keyboard. The keyboard's keys are relatively quiet.... So while not perfect, this set-up gets 4 out of 5 stars.",4,1,2018-6-29,1,1,0
"Overall, both mouse and keyboard are excellent. Mouse is responsive and fits well in the hand, as well as having textured plastic that makes it easy to grip. The keyboard is excellent as well, and functions perfectly.My only complaint, (which is purely aesthetic) is that the RGB back lighting on the keyboard will always be rainbows moving from right to left, and while you can adjust the brightness and the speed, there's no way that I've found to just have it be one uniform color without turning the back lighting off altogether (which makes the keys difficult to see, especially in dim light), but for a price this low, I really have no right to nitpick.",5,1,2019-4-9,1,0,0
"I've had both of these items for nearly 5 months, and I haven't regretted them at all. The keyboard is easy to get used too, and the mouse fits perfect in my hand. I don't like lighted keyboards, so this works perfectly for me. The mouse is very dim, so that's a plus. I'm very hard on my keyboards, and mice. The fact they've held up this long surprises me, and goes to show that even inexpensive items can be diamonds in the rough.

"I initially really liked the feel of the keyboard, as the keys weren't too loud when pressing on them (I did not want a loud keyboard) and it felt pretty smooth, but as I keep using it, I am noticing that the some of the buttons stick a lot, especially the tab button. I have to really put pressure on my 4th finger to press the tab button and it's getting really uncomfortable. It's unfortunate but I will have to return this because of it.",2,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
"Really like this; the keys are a little lower and quieter than normal keyboards and looks super cool with all the lighting options, which are very simple to set up thanks to the very clear manual.  The breathing effect in particular is very cool and the level of brightness is perfect in a dark room.",5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0

I like the fact that the movement keys and Arrow keys are red. It did come with a key remover. Seems to be very well built. Keys are easy to strike, however the space bar is the only key that seems a bit harder to press(it works great, just needs a tad bit more pressure). The mouse is very comfortable and has adjustable weights inside which is a great feature. Both the keyboard and mouse have long braided cables which is absolutely great.

Excellent for gaming and looking cool on the desk.  Love the color backlit keys.  Good for seeing where the W key is in dimly lighted rooms after 12 solid hours of destiny or division.  The mouse can go to 3200 dpi making for fast turn and kills in battlefield.If I had to do more than occasional email sorts of typing I would definitely get a mechanical keyboard for that purpose.

Every time I move the keyboard I don't have to worry that I've hit one of those buttons cos they're not in the way.  The keyboard isn't so bright that it's blinding but the keys are well lit and easy to find.  The space between the keys is very comfortable for typing by touch.  I'm really excited to use this new keyboard of mine.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,1,0

Because I'm not using it on a computer I cannot control the normal functions of the keyboard like the lights, so its permanently rainbow, which I dont have a problem with.Overall its a great product, doesnt feel like cheap like I was expecting.",4,1,2019-1-30,1,0,0

"The keyboard itself works fine. These aren't high end mechanical switches, but I wanted something like this to begin with, as they aren't as loud. The RGB works fine, although it is a bit dim at times.  My only issue comes from the durability of the keys.  I have had 2 issues with them:1: My space bar started ""sticking"": Since the space key is one of the most used keys in FPS, it was naturally the first key to start sticking. I managed to fix it by straightening out the metal rod inside of it, but this shouldn't be necessary for a 6 month old keyboard.",2,1,2019-7-30,1,0,1
"I have never played many games on a p.c before, at least not since maybe 15 plus years ago. This I would consider my introduction to playing competitive multiplayer games on a keyboard. Had it for about a month now; The product works great but I struggled at first to find the right key binds to fit me well, however I think that was due to me never playing on a keyboard prior. The mouse was good at first, but I've switched to a more advanced expensive one to improve my performance. The light up features were cool and all but there's a software you need to download if you want to customize it and I found the directions to getting, installing, and troubleshooting the software to be rather poor. I was personally having issues getting the software to work once I downloaded it, and couldn't find any definitive answer to why I was having the issues I was which is why this isn't a full 5 star. Overall solid product, software is iffy .",4,1,2018-6-20,1,0,0
"I bought this keyboard and mouse a little over a year ago, and since then it has held up nicely. For the keyboard (at first) the keys were a bit hard to push down (even after time had passed), but eventually I wore them down (I guess they were stiff due to lack of use). The keys have a nice feel, and not cheap like something else you'd buy at this price. As for the mouse, it's actually pretty comfortable when using. I game quite a lot (and as it is currently Summer, all the more), and I was looking for a nice keyboard and mouse where I could feel comfortable, type fast and easy, and swiftly and cleanly move my hand two and fro. What I really enjoy about the mouse is the fact that there are adjustable weights in the bottom. You can easily screw and unscrew the bottom cap, and take out as much weight as you want from the mouse, to give it a more light feel. Now, don't get me wrong, the mouse isn't heavy at all when it's at it's default weight, it's about as heavy as any average mouse you have or will use in your life. SIDE BUTTONS - I (as a PC gamer) always enjoy a couple of side buttons to bind to certain commands or chat messages, and this mouse came with 2 extra side buttons, which is awesome, especially for the price.I'd say this keyboard and mouse combo is good for the price. The reason I did not put an entire 5 stars for my review is due to the angle the keyboard is. It may be just me, but, say, with the Razer keyboards, a few of them have a flat-ish, hardly-angled front to them, where you can easily rest your wrists, and with this keyboard I can't comfortably wrest my wrists down on the keyboard's edge, but that's just me being OCD. Other than that, good keyboard (and mouse).",4,1,2016-7-9,1,0,0

She has small hands and says the mouse is a good size.  Overall she is happy.",5,1,2018-11-29,1,0,0

They keyboard is very comfortable & nicely designed (I love the pr-programmed hot keys). The mouse is very comfortable,& very precise movement. The only real complaint is the driver for the side buttons on the mouse.It isn't worth a crap from a gaming standpoint,because of the 33 hot key options. Most of them are all windows related,Not game related. But if you download ANTNSOFT key mapper. You can utilize ALL the mouse buttons with that software. The wighted mouse & adjustable on the fly dpi are great. My only complaint is the mouse driver.

Often times I have to press them multiple times to register/or release the keys I am pressing at the moment with them. Should’ve known since it says it’s not 100% anti-ghosting. But at the time I wasn’t too sure how much of an effect it would have. Going to try and order another keyboard that has that capability and is mechanical red switch instead.",2,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0
"Good little keyboard mouse combo. My only two complaints are that 1. The keyboard changes color but the mouse is only red and doesn't change to match the keyboard, and 2. The keyboard colors need to be reset every time you turn the computer back on. Other than that, the keyboard mouse combo is great.",4,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"My windows key and directional keys no longer work after 3 months. It appears it may be a driver issue, but I can't find this model on the download site. What a waste. Also, I seriously hate the mouse and never use it. Not only is it ugly, it is super sluggish.",2,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0
"The keyboard is good quality and typing with the keys is nice. Good size keyboard. The colors light up very nicely and I like the sleep mode button a lot. I just wish that the color I set it at would stay that way when I turn off the computer, but all I have to do is hit the FN key along with the Home key to set the color I want when I turn on the PC, not that big a deal. I like to switch around the colors anyway. The mouse stays the same color all the time....red.",4,1,2018-12-9,1,0,0
"For a starter keyboard and mouse this combo is going to be hard to beat for the price. After 2 weeks of continued use they are both holding up just like new. The LED lights look and work good if that’s what you’re into. My only problem is the fact it is wired and sometimes the wires get tied and tugged on things when you are trying to work the mouse, but I suppose if you are buying a wired setup that comes with the territory and I can’t really complain. All in all I would recommend for someone looking for a cheap, good quality combo that will get you started and last until you feel like upgrading",5,1,2020-3-16,1,0,0
"This keyboard and mouse combo is pretty great. The keyboard has quite a bit of noise to it and is pretty quick. One note to make is the keyboard, although stated is backlit, is really not. It does have 5 lights throughout the keyboard though. The keyboard, although responsive, has the keys feeling a bit too hard to press for my taste. Nonetheless, it's still really good. The mouse is good too. At max settings, the mouse is pretty fast and the lighting is good too. I can't really say much about the mouse as i have far less experience in mice than i do keyboards, but it seems pretty good to me.TL;DR",4,1,2016-6-17,1,1,0
"Bought because I just needed a keyboard, I play online gaming, mostly at night, so the lighting feature was pretty important. This comes with a variety of different lighting options which I think is pretty cool, I change it every so often just for fun, it's really easy to do. It's also not super loud which I really like. And it came with the corded mouse (been wanting to get rid of my battery powered mouse anyways) for a really good price. Overall really happy with it.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"Mouse left click went out and T key on keyboard also stopped. Filed a warranty claim as they have an 18 months warranty. Apparently they will replace it but it's at my expense. I have to cover all shipping costs. How dare you. It's your product that was fault. I understand things happen and I'm more than happy to send the defective products back but this is the first time a company has ever expected me, the consumer, to cover the cost of shipping for their faulty manufacturing. Never buying again.",1,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
Keyboard feels very cheap and started to make noises after a weak. The mouse that came with it cuts already out. Overall very bad quality and a big waste of money. Better invest a bit more and have something working and lasting.,1,1,2018-12-4,1,1,0
"The keyboard is great. Keys are soft. You can change colors and it's awesome. The mouse is large, too wide. Using it for a while the hand and fingers are having pain.

There are many other products with same price including mouse pad and headset.",3,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0

"Functionality is great. Improved gameplay immensely. Only 4 stars for two reasons. First, every time I turn in my computer I have to manually set the color since I’m not a fan of the pulsing rainbow. Second, the mouse sensitivity is poor. I prefer a very fast mouse, and after adjusting all the settings on my computer to the max level, it still takes a very long stroke to get from one side of the screen to the other.",4,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0

"The keyboard is excellent. Quiet, responsive, and easy to use. I love it.The mouse? It can go die a horrible death. I plugged it in, went and installed new drivers, re-installed them, rebooted a thousand times, and then....I went back to my plain old Microsoft mouse. It's absolutely horrible. It lags. It jumps. It skips. It is pretty much worthless. And since I wanted a mouse I could use all day (I am working in and on software all day, every day) I wanted something better. This thing is the worst mouse I have ever had. I was really excited about it too.",2,1,2017-11-29,1,1,0
"**UPDATE**The company quickly processed a return for just the keyboard which is exactly what I wanted. They couldn't replace the exact keyboard but the one they sent seems exactly the same, and for the price overall of this bundle I can't complain. Overall this is a nice keyboard for the price, you can change the lights and the keys are pleasant to the touch and not loud like some other keyboards. I'm glad the company was very responsive and quick in getting me an exchange for the keyboard, thanks! Oh, and the mouse is good too.

"The only thing that I don't like about it - is that there is a cord that has to be plugged in, although I understand that this is intended to be a gaming keyboard and mouse. The precision is great, the keys flow and the mouse isn't overly sensitive with its movements.",5,1,2020-8-30,1,0,1
"So I bought the bundle to replace my old mouse and keyboard. They keyboard is alright, does the job however it's annoying to readjust the lights every time you boot, you have to reselect color mode. I grabbed an app to lock down my color because i hated changing it every time i booted my computer. The mouse isn't that great for gaming, it also suffers from the same thing the keyboard, it doesn't save your sensitivity and you have to find it every time. I replaced the mouse it came with because it was junk. However for the price i guess it's decent. Just wish they would have solved those problems mentioned.",4,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0

"If you need something flashy that works, but don't want to spend the cash this may be for you. I've had them for about six months now and I can't stand them anymore so I just broke down and ordered better quality products. The duo just feel cheap. The plastic feels cheap, the weight and size of the mouse is garbage, and the keyboards incline feels awkward. The only real quality feature is the braided mouse cord, as my desk likes to eat them (nomnomnom.)

"I've had this combo for about a week now and I see why it's been consistently highly rated.  The keyboard and mouse are, for lack of a better word, tight.  Gamers know what I mean.

You really can't go wrong with this combo and price. I did have a few times one day where a key would just continue going on like it was stuck but it was just one day and only a few times so I will chock it up to the Windows OS.

"I love this keyboard but it does not work well with apple products, the Mac that I'm using right now as an in-between work computer as my gaming and work setup is coming together does not like the keyboard, it can't identify it but other than that it works how it's supposed to!",4,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
My son loves this gaming keyboard and mouse very much. The keys and mouse have a grip feeling which helps a lot playing games. The back lighting is changeable. Only complaint I have is it arrived in the original box with a shipping label on it. He saw it when he came home from school. My fault for not looking to see if there was discreet shipping. I would highly recommend this to anyone!,5,1,2018-12-17,1,0,0
"The keyboard is pretty cool, I do wish the light were a bit brighter. The keys are visible but parts of them aren't fully lit such at the top half of the words Insert / Home / Page (in Page Up).

It resets after ever restart which is super annoying.",3,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
I used this keyboard and mouse because I have difficulty seeing and I needed a back lit keyboard. The keyboard is not as bright as I would like and most of the lights are not useful to me. However the mouse was very good. I would strongly recommend  it.,4,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"Not sure why I do this, but after two years of buying those two pieces still work great! Now I have two computers that I need to constantly switch between, I'm looking to buy a wireless keyboard that allows me switch between my devices seamlessly.

And don't hesitate to buy if you are looking for a keyboard-mouse set that's relatively cheap and that's of good quality!",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
I love this keyboard and mouse setup. Great build quality. The cables themselves are made of a very nice red and black fabric sleeving. The lights on it are subtle and just look good in general. One thing to keep in mind is that this is NOT a back lit keyboard. Which is fine for me. I wasn't looking for back lighting when I bought this.I use this for gaming at least 95% of the time. I'm in fact typing out this review on it right now. Very responsive. Never had any issues while gaming on it. The mouse and the removable weights is nice. I haven't really messed around with them much but I do know that if you removed all of them the mouse itself is as light as a feather.,5,1,2015-6-26,1,1,0
"Stunningly great for the price. I bought this set for my office computer and I really like it. For reference, my home computer has a Razor Black Widow Ultimate and a Logitech Proteus Core, and while I wouldn't say these compare favorably with those two, I would say that the dropoff is significantly less than the horrendous stock keyboard I was provided with. The mouse in particular is great! The keyboard keys are a little mushy, and the construction is pretty flimsy. You can actually see through the keyboard at one spot! For the price though, I would find it difficult to find anything much better or more stylish!",4,1,2017-5-15,1,1,0
My 11-year old son wanted a gaming keyboard for his Xbox One and this works well and looks really cool. The different light settings are fun and the mouse is comfortable.

"I had been using the same old OEM keyboard and mouse for years. When I had to finally deep six my keyboard I decided to spring for a ""slightly nicer"" keyboard and mouse. And this thing FAR exceeded my expectations. It's beautifully designed, and feels amazing to use. The mouse is comfortable and is VENTED! I love it. The beautiful glow of the light (which is customizeable), just brings a pleasant feeling to the soul. I rarely review anything but I'm so happy with this buy!",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"The backlight is bright enough BUT only illuminates the bottom half upper legends of the dual-legend (numeric and Function) keys. Those upper key legends are illegible without getting within 10"" of the keys.

"Very light weight and cheap feeling. Mouse stopped working after 2 months. Since it was past the 30 days for return, I have to pay to mail it back to get a replacement. Talk about not standing by your product. Last time buying this brand.",2,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
Like the feel and the back lights. Switching off PC resets the back light. Have to re-choose my settings again. Overall good product. An inconvenience to get back to the desired back light setting again.Switch off PC button puts the PC into sleep mode and not switch off completely. Pressing the button brings up the computer and the back light settings are retained.,5,1,2019-2-3,1,0,0
"I like the bright lit keys. If you play with the lights down low, you can still see these. The sound of the keys it too loud for me.

"The mouse that comes with the keyboard works just fine.  However, the keyboard just stopped working out of the blue.  I was able to get it to turn back on and the next day it went completely dead.  It lasted a total of 3 months of light use.  I'd shop elsewhere for a keyboard.  Spending an extra $50 you can get a keyboard that will last a decade.",2,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0
"The keyboard and mouse look and work very nice.  I am just disappointed that while the mouse has support so you can set up macros and control the lighting, the keyboard itself does NOT.  you can manually use the function key to set it how you like, but every time you log out or reboot it resets to rapidly blinking lights.  so it isnt much, but having to hit FN-End to stop the blinking every time I log on gets old very quickly, and I wish I had known this before buying.",4,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0

"Had to get a replacement for my old back-lit gaming keyboard, finally decided on this one. I really like that you can change the color (rainbow, green, blue, and red). Took a while to figure out how to change the color from pulsating to constant color, but after figuring that out its a really cool keyboard. Mouse was an added bonus, love the high quality of the cord, as well as the lightweight feel. Overall love this new addition to my gaming PC!",5,1,2019-3-19,1,0,0
"The colors are cool and the design is ergonomic but the keyboard has a serious sticky key issue to the point that it is almost unusable for extended periods. My mornings as a result are spent repeatedly unplugging and plugging back in the keyboard, tapping the keys (enter and shift are the worst) until after an indeterminate amount of time, it resolves itself. And I am a programmer, so you can imagine the frustration.I've never had this issue with a keyboard before. Is there some way to fix this? I'm considering returning this item.

Useless. In the FAQ it was said that it was 1 USB connection. Both the keyboard and mouse require a USB. I would have to choose between my headset or external storage to use this. Get your FAQ's straightened out,1,1,2020-5-6,1,1,0
"This is just a normal keyboard. Other than RGB, the feelings when you press the keys, how they respond to your touches are pretty much the same as to normal computer keyboards. Keys are plastic. Brightness of RGB is just decent. I'd rather give K552 a try.",2,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0

While mine had a very minor superficial defect (which they offered to go above and beyond on a RMA over something so simple and silly, that I couldn't see myself costing them money for the price I paid and the overall quality of the product!) Absolutely love the feel and the changeable weights of the mouse! As for the keyboard as I said a stupidly minor defect, but overall, It feels great, key strokes are smooth and fast, it looks very good. Spill resistant too, c'mon can't beat it!

Hope you enjoy much as I have.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
Bought this for a recent computer build. Actually I am using it right now to write this review. I like the keyboard and the mouse is great. Good feel to both of them. The reason for the three stars is that the LEDs on my keyboard have already gone out. It still works but come on.... lights on the mouse are still a go but can't believe that the keyboard lights are out already. Great feel to both and a solid buy for the money but can't justify more than 3 at the moment.UPDATE: Magically my lights on my keyboard decided to start working again... interesting. I upgraded to a 4 star pending the lights stay on this time. We will see...,4,1,2017-1-8,1,1,0
Used it for a while now and have absolutely no issues. Its surprisingly of good quality and its affordability makes a much better alternative to the Razer series and other comparitive well known brands. I chose to seperately buy the M901 Perdition mouse since it came with 12 programmable keys and love it. The UI to program the mouse is user friendly and does not have a steep learning curve. The program itself is clean and does not interfere with other programs or games. I do have 16 gb of RAM so I cannot say how this will act with someone using less that 8 gb of RAM as I dont anticipate any issues with anyone using over 4gb of memory. The key board easily responds to your touch and I'd say you can get pretty good use out of it apart from the fact that it looks real nice,5,1,2015-7-22,1,0,0

This is the second keyboard and mouse combo I’ve purchased. I bought one several months ago for my son and had to buy another for my daughter!

If you have the resources I'd look elsewhere.",3,1,2018-11-8,1,0,1

I got this to play on Xbox one and it works like a charm. You can use the keyboard to navigate the Xbox but the mouse does not. The colors on the keyboard light up really nicely and you can adjust them to your own taste. The mouse also glows a cool red and works as expected.

"While I get complimented on the look of this keyboard-mouse duo quite often, I've only had the devices for 3 months when the mouse ceased performing well. It skips around my screen and 'gets lost,' which is a problem when editing (copied material ends up where it shouldn't) and when working with elaborate documents, like excel, in which one might accidentally drag a cell's content where it shouldn't be and by the time one realizes it, it's too late to figure out what used to be where. It's a mess. Don't recommend this set-up for long-term use; only short-term when you want something fancy.",2,1,2018-11-26,1,0,0
"I cannot believe there is not a simple button on the side or bottom of the mouse for you to turn the lights off. This is absurd. If a mouse can light up, it is absolutely essential that the lights be easily turned off. I should not have to download software or break the item down just to get inside and disable the lighting. I am amazed any company could be stupid enough to make a product without this capability. I love the keyboard which is why I did not give this one star, but threw out the mouse the first night and bought a different one from a company with some sense.",2,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0

The mouse is pretty well made. I have been using this for about 3 months now and no problems so far. The keyboard is decent but it seemed a bit bulky with a plastic feel when pressed.

You know you hit the key but it does not come through your mic.  The mouse is has also worked out very well, it is solid and has a light rubberized feel to it..",5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"I purchased this because I needed a new keyboard and mouse for work. Our current set was older and losing connection. I know it is a gaming set, but I still purchased because it was a good price and colorful. Needless to say, I am a huge kid and super distracted lol. But it was easy to set up, literally plug and play. Super quiet to type on. Just bright enough with the option to change it.",5,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0
"I had some reservations about how much effort it would take to get everything working under Linux (Mint 19.1), but I went ahead and bought anyway.  Turns out all I had to do was plug-and-play, no extra effort required.  Love the look and feel of both the keyboard and mouse.  My little ones love watching me switch through the different color modes on the keyboard and calling them out along the way.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,1,0
"Alright so this just arrived today. It's alright.The mouse - The mouse is absolutely amazing. It's everything I wanted, it feels nice in your hand, it connects great, weighs perfectly (if it doesn't to you, there's even little weights). The lights look pretty nice and the scrolling is great. Clicks nicely and is great for fighting in different games.",3,1,2015-9-14,1,0,0
"Typed 6 psychology papers and easily sixty hours of gaming so far, highly recommend the keyboard. The mouse isn't bad but admittedly I quickly switched back to my Corsair M56? (I think) the mouse gets less use with my laptop at school. Quality is very good regardless of price! Plan on buying Red Dragon from here on out!",5,1,2019-5-23,1,0,0
"Got this set a couple of months ago and it is still working as smooth as when I first got it. Really like the overall design of the keyboard, but there are not many LEDs so the RGB is not really smooth (Not that matters). The mouse is really responsive and smooth, and I strongly recommend this product for any FPS game",5,1,2019-3-11,1,0,0
I needed a keyboard for an under-desk tray and this keyboard worked out nicely.  The lighted keyboard was a necessity as I work late into the evening and I struggled to see the keyboard before.  The keys are a bit tight so it does require good keyboarding posture or the keys may feel sticky but when used properly it is an excellent product.,5,1,2019-2-13,1,0,0
"I used this to replace an older keyboard and it works very well. As for the mouse, it's quite nice as well, it doesn't have the thin rubber coating that just soaks up oil from your hands. The LEDs on the keyboard could be brighter but even with optic nerve damage, I can at least see the keyboard without a problem. With 7 color settings on the keyboard, it's worth the price.",5,1,2018-2-9,1,0,0
My main criterion for choosing this keyboard and mouse were quiet for the keyboard and adjustable pixel count for the mouse.  The adjustable LED feature of the keyboard was an unexpected plus.  The mouse has a good feel.  The textured top has good tactile feedback and the design nicely fits my hand.,5,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"I love the lights, honestly, I was transfixed by them once I first bought this. And honestly they are not very distracting when you're typing. At least for me. Not the most ergonomic in design but all the fashion. There are keyboards that you can type faster with.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0
"Pretty good keyboard overall, packaging is a little on the HUGE side with minimal impact protection but everything arrived okay. The backspace key is a little mushy, making it delete words a little on the slow side. Massive RGB control with easy to use instructions, everything from speed brightness and color selection. One thing I do not like is not being able to change the breathing mouse lights, wish I could turn it off but it's fine.",4,1,2018-1-22,1,0,0
"I am loving this combo! The mouse has a few too many buttons that I have no idea what they do, but I bought this for the keyboard anyway. The back lite feature is exactly what I wanted. Love the ability to change it.",5,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"Needed a new keyboard quick.. so I got this one. The keyboard is very small and I have a hard time typing on it. The buttons seem to be a little off from my other ones. Also the mouse is SUPER small. VERY uncomfortable. Lastly, EVERY time I turn on my PC I need to reset the colors from flashing and reset the mouse pointer speed. Bad buy for sure,.",1,1,2019-6-12,1,0,0
"I've had this for over a year now and some of the paint is flaking off of the keys I use the most when gaming (WASD), but otherwise I really enjoy this keyboard for the price point. the light colors are not customizeable as well as higher-end keyboards but there's a pretty decent selection to pick from.",4,1,2019-9-21,1,0,0
"I am disappointed that this keyboard does not have downloadable software, and it does not maintain the light settings. You have to reset the lights after every restart. It has a nice feel, and if these 2 things were fixed, this would be an awesome keyboard/mouse combo.",3,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
I really bought this for the backlight feature; it serves this purpose well. The multimedia keys to control media player do not work. The software for the mouse is buggy and is does not come with any instruction manual.,4,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0
"It's a kb & mouse combo for 20 bucks. Far superior to that horrible chicklet thing that Amazon has decided to stick it's label on. Keys are comfortable. Mouse doesn't quite fit my hand, but has the extra buttons on the side. If you're on a budget this is definitely the combo to get. Some of the keyboard labeling makes it look cheap, but it is fairly decent quality. Again kb & mouse combo that's far superior to the amazon essentials for only a couple bucks more.",4,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0
"Just bought this and got it today. It says on page 7 of the manual about downloading software but doesn't give an address or disk on where to download it. I went to their site and the search found NOTHING for Model ""S101-3"".  I haven't even hooked up the keyboard and mouse combo yet and am feeling a bit taken by this set. And their website is unstable to begin with.",3,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"""W"" button wouldn't work. RMA requested, but box destroyed so cancelled RMA. Took apart and found a plastic strip glued near the W button.  Took strip out, still not working. Cut plastic strip and put directly over the W button pad...now it works, for now.  Manufacture defect, poor attempt by manufacture to fix known problem...we'll see how long my fix lasts.",2,1,2017-10-14,1,3,1

"Nice keybourd and mouse. However in the add for this outfit it says software included , there is no software included and there is no mouse drivers to make all the buttons on the mouse work as they advertise, i also tried to d/l drivers to program the mouse and there where no drivers found that would work with this mouse.But it is a nice outfit",4,1,2019-1-12,1,0,0
This keyboard and mouse combo is worth every penny. The backlit options are very cool!,5,1,2020-6-19,1,1,0
I bought this as my beginning gaming keyboard but found many problems in less than an hour. First the keyboard had missing pieces all along the rim. Second the keyboard didn’t let me use the numblock which is very important to controlling brightness and other gaming aspects. And thirdly the light barely lit up the keys. It is still a very fast keyboard but if you bought it RETURN IT!!!,2,1,2020-6-12,1,1,0
"Keyboard worked great for the 1st few months, with no issues. Just recently while playing a game, some of the keys do not function when pressed, while others will keep doing the command even when not pressed. This keyboard has not been used that frequently and is in great shape. Very disappointing.",2,1,2019-6-16,1,0,0
"After growing tired of my wireless mouse/keyboard (connection issues) I looked for a wired keyboard/mouse combo.  The Red Dragon series is a solid entry.  While not comparable to some keyboards with all the extra bells and whistles, this is a solid, well made system.  The keys are comfortable with that satisfying ""clack"" (yes I'm old school), and the mouse is comfortable, easy to use, with several options.  Overall, a great set to have on your desk.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
It's a good keyboard and mouse for its price  you'll have to adjust the cursor speed but it's pretty good. It doesn't have a thousand buttons on the mouse that you wont use cause your game doesn't have a bunch of random controls unless your playing arma or something crazy like expensive ones do.,5,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
"Not sure about the quality of the keyboard and will update once it is opened on Christmas Day - bought this for a Christmas present for my teenage son. Did not come in a shipping box but rather just the product box itself, covered in shipping labels. And on the front of the box where the product is pictured in large display. Very disappointed!",1,1,2018-12-17,1,2,0
Got this keyboard for my custom build because it matches my theme (Hell Boy Theme) and wow I am truly impressed by this keyboard...Ive been using a old mouse and keyboard that ive had for years but now this is going to be my main keyboard..At first I was like WTH this mouse is so slow but you the hit the button below the mouse wheel and it changes the speed of the mouse and my god does it improve your shooting in FPS games..The rgb is nice and not distracting at all and love the letters on the keys even light up with the lights under it....Great Product for a Great Price,5,1,2019-2-19,1,0,0
"Great keyboard if you are just getting into PC gaming, The keyboard feels great and the keys are not too loud (well depends on how fast you type). The keys are interchangeable and it comes with a tool that helps you do that. The keyboard also comes with LED's  on the Dragon and the two red areas next to it, as well as the two on the bottom right and left. The Mouse is also a GREAT one. The mouse has an LED on basically on the red spots and comes with two buttons on the side that can be programmed, the buttons also have different feels so you do not have to look on which one your gonna press. The mouse also feels great and and has good ergonomics, mouse feels durable and tough and the right click/left click are also not slippery. This keyboard and mouse combo is great for people just getting into PC gaming.",5,1,2015-10-29,1,1,0
"It's decent. The colors running across keyboard are cool at first, but quickly become annoying. Doesn't seem as responsive as other keyboards, especially for a ""gaming"" keyboard. Good for the money though.",3,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"I really like the design of the mouse and keyboard, especially the LEDs on the mouse. I also bought the 12x10 inch mouse pad. It looks really cool with the mouse and keyboard. The button to change the DPI is very nice if I want to change it for another game where I need a lower sensitivity, but I like to have a high one on another game. The side buttons are nice, as I have never had buttons on the side of my mouse. They are very nice to go backward or forward on a webpage. The only problems I have is that the enter key is in a weird position. It haven't really used the keyboard much, as I am using a laptop right now, but I will use it in the future when I get my desktop all set up.The main problem I have is that sometimes when I push down the left mouse button, it squeaks. I have something I might be able to spray in it without it breaking the mouse, but I am too scared to lift up the mouse button, in fear of breaking it. I really like the mouse, but it squeaks too often and I can hear it through my headset. It really bothers me. Would rate 5 stars if it didn't squeak.",3,1,2015-9-2,1,0,0
"Bought this combo for my wife and her new PC build.  It does not get any better than this for the price.  I hope this company succeeds because they build quality products.  Yes it is made in China and that can sway many people.  However, this combo (along with their other products) are top notch for the price tag.  We bought the Archelon mouse pad as well for her and I am jealous of it. I would trade my hard Razer Destructor in a heart beat.  I also have the RedDragon Mammoth mouse from a Christmas gift.  Awesome mouse and the first time we were introduced to this company.  So far so good.",5,1,2015-2-23,1,2,0
"I have a gaming laptop and having an external keyboard has never crossed my mind, but wanted to give it a chance and stumbled upon this keyboard. After using it for the first few days, I never went back to typing on my integrated keyboard on my laptop, the tactile feel of this keyboard and the RGB effects are far superior than a built in keyboard. Would definitely recommend getting this keyboard whether it is for typists, gamers, or anyone, a phenomenal product.",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
This was a gift for my 12 yr old son who games a lot and uses it for school work. Keys are soft to the touch but same layout as a basic keyboard. The black color makes it not as bright but still lights up all over.,5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
This keyboard is a great keyboard for gaming. It has durable keys and so far it has been holding up. It was a great price and it even came with a mouse that also does well for my gaming. I play on it for hours at a time and never run into a problem. For this price there isn’t a keyboard that compares,5,1,2019-7-2,1,0,0
"works well, mouse is amazing, easy to swap speeds.  Keys can get worn after long repeated use, such as the WASD pad, space bar got stuck, took it off, it has room to move left and right, and when either full left or full right it will catch the plastic nub underneath, just move it back to middle and try not to pound it too much next time.",5,1,2018-7-18,1,0,0
"A great addition for your desk top. The lights do turn off then you shut down or turn them off manually. Mouse is almost too fast, had to adjust the pointer speed to get ""better"" accuracy when playing SNIPER FURY.Worth the money for sure, would recommend.",5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"What else can I say about this that others haven't already said? The keyboard is nice and responsive, great for gaming, the mouse is durable and easy to click, and it looks amazing. The build quality is absolutely incredible and I would absolutely recommend this to any budget gamer. At first glance, this doesn't look like something so inexpensive, but, lo and behold, it is, and it's great, and I love it. I've had absolutely no troubles with the equipment whatsoever and it all arrived on time and undamaged.",5,1,2018-6-2,1,0,0
"Sadly, if you're a fps gamer I would avoid this keyboard.  It lacks the basic ability to take more than 2/3 inputs at a time, so shift key running crounching and pushing one more button is a no go.  As a basic keyboard for typing and etc it works fine. For slow paced games, it should be good too, but for high paced FPS games, it sadly falls short of its necessary function.",3,1,2019-8-1,1,1,0
"I have used this keyboard for work and gaming over the last year without issue. The color is true to internet depiction and can be cycled through different settings - strobe, a slow fade, or one consistent color.The mouse also works fantastically. It has a button which allows you to quickly switch between 4 different DPI settings. The color on the mouse also isn't too bright or annoying.",5,1,2019-7-20,1,0,0
"For the price, its not a terrible keyboard. The only real gripe that I have is that some of the keys, especially the back space key, wanted to feel like it was binding unless you pressed it down exactly vertical. We ended up setting this keyboard aside and got a mechanical keyboard. If you're on a budget, this will do just ""ok"" for gaming, but not great at all for typing.Overall, the keyboard doesn't feel like cheap budget keyboard and the lighting is nice.",3,1,2019-1-24,1,1,0
"This is an amazing deal for the price. This is the best mouse and keyboard combo for the price. The keyboard looks and functions perfectly. The mouse is great, it has adjustable weights so it's comfortable for everyone. It also has adjustable dpi settings which I tend to keep on the middle setting because the higher one is really, really sensative. The only complaint I have is that when you press on the space bat there's a sort of springy sound but that's a minor issue. Perfect for a black and red setup.",5,1,2016-9-14,1,0,0
"I have three of these...one at work, one at home, and one I bought for my wife's work. They are outstanding and I love the feel of the keys!

I've used Corsair, Razor and a few others but have found that overall workstation, gaming and long typing sessions this Keyboard and mouse combo are amazing!! I love them and have bought 3 sets!! Not trying to endorse this company but I am beyond pleased.

"Short and simple, Keyboard was great and so was the mouse however the mouse for some reason and few months after purchase started freaking out and would do its own thing without the mouse even moving, not sure of the issue but I threw it away for recycling.

This is a very good combo the keyboard and mouse seem to work very well I have no problem with the the mouse or the keyboard but I do recommend to completely turn off your computer once you're done if you're trying to sleep during the computer is asleep the RGB will not be able to be turned off so please make sure the shutdown your PC completely if you do not want to be disturbed up during the night because of the RGB and the mouse has red flashes,5,1,2019-9-14,1,0,0

"I love everything about this setup. The mouse and keyboard quality surprised me a lot, I'm currently playing Subnautica and I'm able to fine-tune building placement with the mouse, it glows a gorgeous dark red, and I set the keyboard for a low cyan backlight at night. The keyboard makes satisfying clacks when I'm typing, and the colors and backlight features are really fun to cycle through. I set it to dark blood red when I play the Forest and it really improves the experience tenfold. Very highly recommend.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0

Overall the RGB on the keyboard pushed me to this product. The mouse however only shows red led and has no other options to match my setup.Both products work great - but the mouse click is loud.

"Great gaming keyboard/mouse for cheap. Keyboard feels great and allows many buttons to be pressed at once. Never owned a gaming keyboard before and had no idea how well they work/feel. Mouse is extremely grippy, slippery, and precise. Red LEDs do not turn off but are not as annoying to fall asleep to as blue ones are. Have not had to throw dirty clothes over the keyboard/mouse in order to sleep as I had to previously. First set I ordered had a dead ""1"" key on the keyboard, but I returned it through Amazon (not through the manufacturer) and was immediately refunded, allowing me to purchase a new one. New set arrived in perfect condition and I'm quite satisfied.",5,1,2015-2-18,1,0,0

If the button is accidentally pressed in the slightest, there is no canceling this! All your work is instantly lost! Everything not saved is gone. If you do decide to order this, take a blade a pop out this button.The mouse that came with this keyboard is junk. Keyboard has been fine so far besides this stupid button.",3,1,2019-2-27,1,0,0
"Great keyboard and mouse, really comfortable to use. Being able to change between multiple colors on the fly instead of having to use software is amazing, I'm constantly changing the color of the back light to match the games I play.Small downside is the keyboard is fairly larger than my previous, but that is also a positive thing since the keys are cramped together but are spaced out nicely.",5,1,2019-4-22,1,0,0
I really like the mouse. It is just the right size for my hand and weighted for just the right feel. The keyboard is good. It has good feedback for touch typing and feels durable.

She uses them only for gaming and loves them. she has had them about 3 weeks now.,4,1,2018-8-25,1,0,0
"Cons: It is a great product, but using the fn key on the far right and f2 or f3 to change the volume is a bit of a reach or requires 2 hands maybe take out the button to the right of the fn key, move the bottom row over and add one on the left aswell.Pros: Great budget gaming keyboard, the meshanicial feel is nice and not to loud.",4,1,2019-3-14,1,0,0
"Nice combo...A steal as a set!I finally got around to giving away my HP (which was the reason I was building this new system.)  It didn't have an expansion slot to add a video card.  The keys on this red dragon keyboard seem a little bit closer together than the HP keyboard, and there is more push distance than I'm used too, But aside from that, this combo is wonderful!  I SUPER LIKE the mouse and I'm sure once I get used to the new key spacing It should be just fine.  Not cheap at all for the super great price of 25.00  (the mouse alone is worth that)",5,1,2015-12-9,1,0,0

The enter key being a different shape takes some getting used to and I still haven't found out how to turn the lights off, but the hey board is great. The mouse is really nice too. Very comfy to use and I like the mouse 4 and 5 buttons for your thumb. The dpi button never gets pressed by mistake which is good.

"For $30 i really didn't expect to get a keyboard/mouse combo at this quality. The anti-ghosting of the keyboard feels solid. I own a Razer Chroma keyboard and I almost like this one better.... The mouse doesn't feel cheesy either, its solid and it has counterweights in the palm of the mouse which i've never seen before.

"Coming from a serious gamer who sits hours on end at the computer desk with a video game channel. I was excited to see when this arrived quickly as well as connecting it to my rig. All was going well in the beginning..after a month of use. It started to show some faults. While the mouse is still preforming well as the day it arrived, the keyboard is starting to stagger. Eventually. While playing games like ark when trying to run away from dinosaurs or anything else that uses single buttons like w to run. It starts to stutter resulting in a slow skipping character progression. While it won't affect casual gamer. It seriously has its affects when it comes to certain situations.",4,1,2015-8-17,1,0,0
Great cheap light up keyboard. I wouldn’t recommend it as ergonomically awesome as it’s a standard layout. That’s not why I bought it. I wanted a cheap cool light up keyboard. Works well!,5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
"For the money, I’m very happy with this mouse and keyboard.  They perform as expected...almost.  I have zero complaints about the mouse.  But the keyboard isn’t perfect.  The surrounding plastic looks cheap, and my backspace key is slower to rebound than the rest of the keys.  It’s fully functional though, so i didn’t bother sending it back.  It just feels a little strange.  The rest of the keys have a good feel to them, and the lights are nice.So, overall it’s a good combo, but there’s some minor quality control issues.",4,1,2018-10-31,1,0,0
"What an excellent set of products. The keyboard itself is more than alone worth the price. The keyboard is smooth and precise, with perfect key weights for gaming as well as typing. No obnoxious type-writer sound however you can still notice if you preform a keystroke audibly. No annoying extra ""macro"" buttons that end up not working. Have not actually USED the mouse as I am currently using Reddragon Perdition (which is baddddass), however it looks extremely nice with an excellent click style and extra buttons. 5 star product for a 5 star price!",5,1,2014-12-11,1,1,0
"So, I've had this set for aprox. 6 months now. Before now, I've had no problems, but as of the last week or so the mouse wheel has been acting up. It feels as though the rubber has expanded or loosened from the internal part for the wheel, so I just spin it with no results. I have to press down hard for it to catch, to the point where I actually press the center mouse button. This is no big problem unless you, like me, play competitive games online, where that extra second of having to fix up the mouse wheel to, say, switch a weapon or equipment of some kind, can cost you your life or even team victory. I am sure that there is an easy fix to this, which I will likely try to find. If I can, I will return and give it the 5 stars it deserves.Edit: I have searched for help fixing it, but it doesn't look like there is any readily found.I am still having the problem, but it seems to be increasing more frequently. It is beginning to become almost unusable. If anyone has any information or can refer me to a video that could help, I would be Very grateful. I may still have some time left on my warrantee, so I'll look into it.",4,1,2016-4-3,1,0,0

"item Was shipped in the merchandise box which was ok, the keyboard is awesome and feels like it’s made of good material, buttons are a little stiff but that’s to be expected. The mouse feels ok, the dpi setting doesn’t save so you need to adjust it every time you unplug it and plug it in. Would’ve been a 5 star review but the 2 buttons on the side of the mouse don’t work, I noticed when I unboxed the product there was a small piece of black tape over one of the two buttons but overall I just wish that QC would’ve done a better job before sending me a faulty product",3,1,2018-10-31,1,0,0

I like the keyboard so far since having it. The backlit leds are pretty good. I wish it had more options for colors. Also one of the lifter legs are missing.

They have firm feedback and are low on sound.,4,1,2019-1-20,1,0,0

Considering this is a gaming keyboard the most important feature for me is that I can game effectively with it and it does not accomplish that need.  The keys are super rough to push on to where after a few hours of playing my fingers would legitimately start to get sore.  When playing shooters I like to shimmy back-and-forth between walls with the A and D keys but with this keyboard since it's so hard to push down on the buttons it is impossible.  Sometimes I would even die because when I intended to move out of the way the key was so hard to push down on that it wouldn't register because I didn't push it hard enough.  I don't need a keyboard that requires me to slam down on the key to get it to work.,2,1,2017-12-9,1,0,0

Probably the best keyboard under 50$. The design is nice and all the button have a nice feedback rebound feeling when typing. I feel like I can type a little bit faster because of it.

The cord is wrapped in some sort of nylon which prevents my stupid cat from eating it, so that's a plus.

"Was pleasantly surprised by both the quality and cost of this product. I personally was already set on getting a mechanical keyboard so i got this solely for the mouse with the added bonus of having an extra gaming keyboard around. I am so happy with the feel, responsiveness, and look of both the keyboard and mouse that i may not even keep the mechanical unless it makes a very noticeable difference in my gaming or typing ability. The Mouse has to be one of the most comfortable mice I've ever felt, the grip is perfect for my hand and it has holes in the sides so your hands don't get sweaty from rubbing or pressing against it for long periods of time. The middle mouse button also scrolls and WORKS WELL AS A BUTTON. Not normally a big deal but for the first time in my life i actually use the mouse button for things because it is so easy to press down on without accidentally scrolling, it has the feel of both a button and a wheel which is great for games like Path of Exile. honestly for 28 bucks this is practically a steal. I would have payed that much for a much crappier mouse at office depot, and here i got an amazingly comfortable and responsive mouse AND a decent keyboard as well.",5,1,2015-7-13,1,0,0
"I can't complain about this set at all. It was exactly what I was looking for, I wanted a membrane keyboard to take with me travelling, because I may be bunked up with people, I didn't want something too loud.

"A total steal for the price. It looks cool and even works better than my old logitech set (less input lag). The keyboard just feels good to type on, and the clicking sounds that come from it are fantastic. Not too loud, and not mechanical, but it just feels almost therapeutic to click. My only gripe is that there's no way(as far as I can tell) to turn off the red LEDs without completely unplugging the board and mouse from the system, even when it's shut down. I've resorted to just hitting the off switch on my power supply so the lights wont be on 24/7. Other than that, it's a great set that's further improved by the seductive price.",4,1,2016-7-12,1,1,0

The only complaint that I have, the reason why it is 4 stars and not 5, is that I feel that the enter key is oddly shaped compared to other keyboards. I keep hitting the slash button instead of enter because all of the keyboards that I am used to has the enter key going in towards the median more than this keyboard.

"This product is an amazing deal for just $29.99. The Combo is unlike any other companies that sell their products that are made from cheap material. This is an RGB keyboard with a sufficient amount of lighting effects. I like how the flowing rainbow effect from the Razer keyboards can be achieved on a cheap keyboard. There are also 25 Anti-Ghosting keys. The keyboard is not mechanical, but it is smooth and feels nice with a decent sound. However, the mouse is a different story. The mouse stutters sometimes while gaming, and the entire mouse is made of a plastic that is very rough and coarse. The mouse only has one color, red. The kind of upsetting thing is that the keyboard does not have a braided cord but the mouse does. This is a MEMBRANE keyboard NOT MECHANICAL. Do not buy this if you are looking for a mechanical keyboard because the switches do not look like cherry mx and are definitely membrane switches. The multimedia keys are not so useful, and can cause you to possibly shut down your computer because one of them symbolizes a power button. Also the Redragon logo on the keyboard does not glow and neither do the multimedia keys. Overall, this is a good feeling keyboard and I do recommend it.",3,1,2018-4-19,1,4,0

"This keyboard is marketed as a good gaming keyboard, with the perks of a mechanical keyboard. It is not that. I really suggest you do not buy this. It feels very tactile for the first 3 weeks, but then becomes mushy, due to it being a membrane keyboard.

So I knew what I was typing and a lot of colors and diff kinda ways you can preset it. the only thing bad about it is sometimes it resets to its Default rainbow and dim out and in but you just get used to it and makes you all spiffy and probably you end up changing it and EXPLORING NEW COLORS,5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0

Getting both a keyboard and mouse for the price was a pretty good deal. Ive been using the mouse for about 3 weeks now.... Works great for gaming. Not as ergonomic as my last mouse but does the job.

"These products are generally good.My favorite part of this bundle was the mouse. The mouse is built excellently and is quite smooth on all surfaces. Although I did have a little difficulty taking of the cover for the weights. The keyboard is a different story. When I first opened the box and saw the quite well built keyboard I had good expectations. What truly killed the keyboard for me was the keys themselves. They were EXTREMELY mushy( only a couple of them).  Some of these keys were so mushy, that it was very difficult to tell if I even pressed the key at all.  This might of been a defect but I don't know. I'm giving this 4 stars because I believe that other people might have better luck other than me.",4,1,2017-1-18,1,0,0

However, The side buttons are unprogrammable. No drivers that come with this to program adjust the function of those 2 side buttons.

As for the mouse, I think it's great, the buttons on the side of the mouse get a little annoying sometimes, because I find myself accidentally hitting the back button.

My son aspires to be a pro gamer....and he basically feels like one. Keyboard looks really cool. I’ve used it and I don’t have any complaints. You get that gaming look at a low price.

"The keyboard is a great keyboard for the price. It has a nice braided cord that is long and comes with a Velcro strap attached to it. The only complaint I have with the keyboard is the size of the enter key. I'm use to keyboards with a larger enter key and on this keyboard, the "" \ "" key is located where the larger sized enter key usually is. Hopefully with some time I will get use to that. I haven't used the mouse so I cannot give an opinion on the mouse.",4,1,2016-1-5,1,2,0

Great little budget gaming package. Mouse is sturdy and feels good with my big hands. Keyboard is noisy as expected but looks great and the keys are spaced just right with the right resistance and feel for someone who grew up playing on a mechanical. Key puller included and holes installed to help with spills. Media keys are awesome as well. Gave it 4 stars only because i had to search a bit to find the support website which is reddragonusa. C o m . The one listed in the manual was pretty crappy.  Also the mouse driver doesnt seem to add much flexibility with the extra buttons but it does its job.

This was a really good keyboard for the price since it includes RGB lighting with different lighting modes to choose from or you can keep the lighting static. Read the instruction manual for how to change the lighting by the way. The mouse and keyboard have a very gamer centralized look that make me feel comfortable playing for hours at a time.

Mouse works and feels great and the key bored looks and handles nice. You dont have to put a lot of pressure on the keys and they react fast. Also they light up red (outer edge of keyboard) and didn't know that before so that's a cool extra thing. You cant turn that off though until your computer shuts off. Also and the main thing for me is that they don't feel cheep either.,5,1,2015-4-4,1,0,0
"This was a nice keyboard and mouse when I first received it. However after 3 months the ability to turn off or change the keyboard lights stopped. So now it is constantly cycling through the colors, very quickly, and I can't stop it. The mouse wheel has also seized. You can't click it down and it is hard to scroll. Would rather spend a couple more dollars on stuff that functions longer than 3 months with minimal use.",3,1,2017-12-8,1,0,0

Wow! That's one word to sum up this bundle. For being so cheap it is extremely high quality. Lets start with the mouse. I play CS:GO for about three hours a day and I frequently need to switch between a slow and a high DPI. The button works amazing i can go from sluggish AWPing to nailing all the flick shots. The clicks are nice and responsive. Now the keyboard. It's what you expect to be at a 40-50 dollar range for 27 bucks. The keys themselves are not backlit but there are some lights on the bottom and top. The buttons are not cherry switches but I'm not complaining for 27 dollars.  You can defiantly feel when you push them in though.,5,1,2015-4-9,1,0,0

"I upgraded to overpriced name brand accessories a few months ago but I used this set for well over a year. What a tremendous value. I'm a very competitive gamer and not once did I question whether or not my keyboard and mouse were sub-optimal. Sure the mouse has a limited DPI and the keyboard is of the soft membrane type but they're very accurate and very responsive. You don't want to run a higher DPI than this mouse offers, period. It would be preferable if you could go lower even. The keyboard is very satisfying to type on, while I very much like my mechanical keyboard it's not quite as ""soothing"" as typing on the Vajra even though I've had it for months.  The mouse is a little small for my tastes even though my hands are perhaps only marginally larger than average. The mouse feels a little cheap but it does the trick very well. In all I would definitely recommend this set if you're interested in maximizing value.",5,1,2017-3-14,1,1,0

"Beyond all its glowing bits, its woefully boring. It has a very odd design, where the enter key is longer ontop, where your pinky finger CANT reach, rather then on the bottom like every other standard keyboard Ive seen but... thats about the most interesting feature on this vanilla hunk of junk. The keys are fine, the red WASD keys and arrows is sorta cool... I guess. The mouse is actually pretty decent, Its a simple, 2 extra button mouse that has a nice scroll wheel made of rubber, in the shape of a cog or a gear. It also has 3 sensitivity settings, which is also nice.In the end though, its really cheap.

The mouse I received squeaked (not joking) every time I clicked the left button, too. The buttons themselves are spaced too far apart - so it stretches your two fingers to hold the mouse properly.The keyboard feels like the cheapest hard plastic keyboard out there.

"I originally purchased this for my husband, but his setup keeps him from using this product. I am now using it and I really like it. The keyboard is much quieter than the one I was using. It has some good weight to it and the buttons are easy to press. I really like the backlit RGB. It as quite a few settings to help anyone customize it to his or her liking. The keys have a matte feel to them which I really like. I hope in time the coating doesn't rub off. The mouse is a little to big for my fingers, but luckily my fingers don't have to be at the tip of the buttons for it to recognize the click. This is a personal problem. I have small hands and short fingers. I usually use compact mice because I use a claw grip. I cannot do that with this mouse because of the size. This would be perfect for someone with a larger size hand. I do love the dpi button and the weight customization. The mouse registers lighter pressure than other mice I use and I really like that. The top of the mouse is textured. That might be a problem for some, but I don't mind it. All in all I really like this combo and I think the quality is great for the price. I highly recommend this for casual gamers like myself.",5,1,2018-2-1,1,0,0

it's a perfectly acceptable low end keyboard in windows when it works. The special features tend to break things even there though and finding the command to disable them can be difficult. I use linux and thats where this thing REALLY SUCKS! it uses a non standard keyboard interface a microdia controller and if you like using shortcuts - ctrl alt and shift are all reported as the same key stroke under any kernel or distro and boy it sucks. The solution is #1 dont buy it because they hate linux or #2 use this driver https://bitbucket.org/Swoogan/aziokbd which can be installed manually this way:sudo apt-get install mercurial build-essential linux-headers-generic,2,1,2015-12-4,1,2,0

"This is okay I like that it has holes and can be rinsed off and run water through (never tried it though). My one and only complaint is the enter key location/shape. Usually the enter is sort of a reverse ""L"" shape and instead the shape is more straight up and down and in the spot where I usually hit the enter key with my right pinky they put the backslash.  I'm always hitting backslash or backslash and enter together.  It's the only keyboard I've seen this way and I have to consciously tell myself to reach a little farther with the pinky to get to the enter.  I don't know if I'll get used to it or have to find another keyboard.  It's not expensive so I'm going to try to get used to it.  Not out much if I can't and someone could use it who doesn't touch-type.",3,1,2016-8-2,1,1,0

"I have no complaints about this keyboard and mouse. I was happy that it included a mouse. It's a decent keyboard for the price. It looks very stylish. It does have some drawbacks, the keys can sound a bit cheap and they'll make a springy sound when pressed sometimes, but that's a very minor problem. I like being able to control media functions right from the keyboard. I did not look very closely when I bought this keyboard. The enter key is more like the old fashioned keyboards instead of the newer ones that I prefer, but this is not a deal breaker because I don't even notice the difference in use. They both have a red and black rope type material cord which is great for someone like me because I'm always unplugging the wrong thing from my computer. The mouse works on any surface, I use it on my mattress and have no need for a mousepad. It also has weights in it so that you can determine how heavy or how light that you want the mouse to be.",5,1,2016-4-28,1,0,0

This is a review on the product. Not the seller. Product came well packaged and on time.\You get what you pay for. Many of the keyboards with the highlighted W A S D and ARROW keys usually are rubberized for enhanced sensitivity but your keyboard is no different from the rest of the keys. The description says you can exchange them but the package does not have any instruction manual or CD that lets me program the mouse or keyboard or show me how to swap them out. The number ZERO 0 on the number needs to be stabbed hard for output. Regular finger press does not yield any output especially when typing in passwords with it.That's why I say it's not excellent or good. The quality here is a hit or miss. The pros are that it is a relatively cheap keyboard and if it breaks; get another one.,3,1,2015-11-10,1,0,0

"It came on time, but is overall not that good. The buttons are hard to press and they are stiff. My ""Shift"" ""Space"" and ""ASDF"" etc. buttons are all so stuck. They are really hard to press down. The lights are also very dimmed. They are not that bright. However, the mouse is fine. The button clicks are not too loud or quite. It is fast and I like how you can change its DPI which is pretty good. I also dislike how you can not turn off the lights even when the computer is off. When I go to bed at night, the light are still on and it wastes a lot of electricity. The only way to fix that is to unplug your computer every night, or to unplug the keyboard and mouse USB.",2,1,2016-11-19,1,3,0

This keyboard is pretty good and the important keys really stand out (for fps shooters like counter strike) and the buttons are can take some punishment. The problem I have with this mouse is that if my space bar is hit the right way it makes a really annoying spring sound and it's distracting. I just wish that this keyboard lit up so I can see te kea better in dark settings.,4,1,2015-7-10,1,0,0
Exactly how I thought it would look very nice keyboard with its led lights makes me feel like a true gaming master.

"This is a pretty standard budget keyboard and laser mouse.  The keys feel a bit mushy, though the mouse is a good quality for being laser.  If this fits your price-point well, and you accept that you are getting budget products, than this is a great buy.  I personally recommend paying the $50 more for a true mechanical keyboard as the typing experience1 is a night-and-day difference.  The keyboard does look nice, though I found the red lighting was very frustrating especially since I couldn't find a way to turn it off.Overall, if your budget is $25 for your mouse and keyboard, this will do you just fine.  You get a little more than what you pay for, though I recommend a higher quality product.",3,1,2016-2-17,1,0,0

"I really like this keyboard mouse combo. so far. Pretty much exactly what I expected, after all the reviews I read previous to this purchase. The only down side so far is not being able to turn off the keyboard and mouse lighting. Something I knew before I made the purchase, to be fair. For gaming it does the job rather well. Will I keep this setup forever, probably not. The keyboard is a good entry level gaming keyboard, not amazing, but very good. The same for the mouse. I will be more than happy if this buys me a few months until I figure out exactly which mouse and keyboard I want to invest in. For less than 30 bucks (about half the price you could spend on just a mouse alone), I'm very satisfied as of now.

I've only been using the keyboard and mouse for a day but so far they both feel pretty good.

"This is my first gaming keyboard. I mainly got it for the colored wasd keys, windows key lock, and other features. Also although it isn't a mechanical keyboard it's hybrid membrane switches are actually very nice and pretty close to mechanical switches. I enjoy typing with it and it works well for gaming. I wish the multimedia controls didn't require simultaneously pressing of the F key but at least they're there. I was so mesmerized by the led illumination that I don't know when but one of the led lights in one of the lower panels went out. The panel still lights up because there are two in each panel so I don't really care. The seller offered to replace it but I don't really care enough because for the price I'm still very pleased with the keyboard the way it works now.They mouse is actually the best part of the combo. I was only wanting to replace my keyboard but having a mouse that matches is cool. The mouse is very light even with all the removable weights in it. It's very accurate and has enough features. And looks amazing in my opinion.",5,1,2016-4-12,1,1,0

"I absolutely love the design and feel of the mouse and keyboard. I'm a very aggressive typer - or so I'm told - and the keys on this keyboard are smooth and help reduce the amount of noise I make while typing. That said, they're not too soft, and they have a satisfying amount of resistance. The enter key is slightly smaller than most, and it took some getting used to. The mouse is very comfortable and the DPI can be adjusted on the fly.My only complaint is that the red lights which make the keyboard and mouse look awesome *cannot* be turned off. Even shutting down, or putting  my computer to sleep doesn't turn the lights off, and since these are in my bedroom and they are quite bright, I toss a towel over them at night to block the light.",4,1,2016-5-20,1,0,0

"I should have known better. Although this keyboard and mouse have generally good reviews, I think you get what you pay for in this case. Keyboard is cramped, and the keys are too close. The lights on the keyboard and mouse are not tied to software at all. For my computer, the light stay on ALL the time, whether the computer is turned on or not. I've never had peripherals do that before. Very annoying that I have to unplug the keyboard and mouse to get the lights to turn off. Mouse and keyboard buttons are squishy.

"I LOVE this keyboard. It's absolutely perfect. Now, I've always been a PC gamer, but I've never purchased a gaming keyboard or mouse. . My first keyboard was just a plain black Logitech keyboard that I've owned for five years, and my mouse was a trackball. Now see, I've always wanted a keyboard that glows. The Alienware keyboards looked so beautiful with the ability to customize the colors. But I guess I decided..Why do I need that? I've been typing ever since I was a child. I have the locations of every key memorized. I don't even have to look down anymore. Eventually, I found the mouse and figured I'd give it a try. My finger was just getting ready to hit ""Proceed to checkout"" when all of a sudden, I saw this combo.So I figured..Why not kill two birds with one stone?",5,1,2015-3-27,1,9,0

"I was pleased to find out that my order came early. However, I am beyond frustrated with the mouse that comes along. The main reason I ordered this set was for the mouse and now I'm disappointed. When the mouse is plugged in, it seems to work. After about 4 or 5 clicks, it stops being able to click entirely. Not only that, but when I unplug the mouse it causes my entire computer to not respond to any clicking from any mouse whatsoever. Guess that's what I get for buying a cheap set. The keyboard is nice though. I like the feel of the keys. However, several buttons look as if they are pushed further down than the rest. I noticed that as I took it out the box. In my case it is the 4,6, and Delete button. I will add that both do look pretty cool.2 STARS -- I would look somewhere else, honestly.",2,1,2015-12-10,1,0,0

"They enter key is weirdly placed and sized, so if you do any sort of actual typing, be prepared to hit the / button instead of the enter key. It sounds like a small thing, but it completely slows everything down. No volume buttons, which I found strange. The mouse is very nice. When I had to return it, they made me pay for shipping.

"So, only had this keyboard for a week now and it's a huge improvement. The keys feel really nice, I have no complaints. The only con I could mention is that the keys are a little on the small side which took some getting used to compared to my stock keyboard. But that's just a personal aesthetic adjustment. The mouse is awesome. Ergonomic and smooth as hell gliding across my steel series 16x12 mousepad. The weights and quick DPI change button are an excellent edition and have helped me really tone in my reaction time. All in all the only complaint I have for this package is that I wish there was a way to turn the backlights off without unplugging the USB. It's not a big problem, and not that bright at night where it keeps me up. But for longevitys sake.",5,1,2015-1-29,1,0,0

In short if you are a casual gamer i recommend this keyboard and mouse combo.. If you are a FPS player i would recommend looking at something else. the keyboard feels very mushy and the mouse is locked to only 3 pre-set Dpi's I would go for something like razer if your going to be into Fps games since they offer a software where you can mess with dpi and usely the colors on the mouse.. however if you are on a budget and you casually game i would definitely pick up this keyboard for its very detailed design of the mouse and keyboard in all i give this keyboard an A+ for casual gaming since it offers a nice feeling but i give it a D- for FPS games since it never really offers a dpi that you as the person wants and the keys can feel very mushy when playing..R.E.

The mouse and keyboard have quite a few bright LED backlit spots. There is no way to toggle the backlit off which means they remain lit up even when my pc is in sleep mode.

"I got this thing about two months ago and at first it worked fine. It was my first gaming keyboard and from what I knew it worked pretty good - responded quickly and felt right in my hands. Then about four days later it started spamming the letter ""L"", so when I went to log into my computer all I got was hundreds of little dots in the password bar. I tried unplugging it, but the ""L's"" kept coming. I had to restart my computer two times before it stopped. This has never happened before with any of my ""non-gaming"" keyboards, and ever since the ""L"" incident I've stored in it's box. The mouse works fine, and I use it more often than not with most of my games. However it still stands that the key element of this package is the keyboard, so I'm taking off three stars for it's unusable behavior.",2,1,2015-6-10,1,0,0

The thumb buttons add great flexibility when gaming, and they both light up and look great.

I mostly use this keyboard for gaming and don't type much so I'm very glad it's the ""o"" key and not one of the more important ones like ""w"" or something.

I am replacing an old and tired Logitech combo keyboard and mouse set. I didn’t know what to expect with the Redragon brand but was pleasantly surprised. The combo looks great just sitting on the desk.The mouse is very responsive and the DPI is adjustable (3 settings) via the button under the scroll-wheel. The lighting looks great.  There are weights in the bottom of the mouse that you can add/remove to adjust to your liking. I am using about 1/2 of the weights and that works for me.

As for the mouse, I've never actually purchase a gaming mouse before but I do like the feel of this one, very ergonomic and the right and left click are a little textured so you will have a good grip on the mouse.

"This was the first gaming keyboard I purchased. Although the keyboard is not a mechanical one (hence its significantly lower price), it is well built and rather sturdy. The mouse is excellent quality and is comparatively more grippy than other mice I have used. Additionally, the braided USB cables on both are excellent and show that Redragon is rather attentive of quality.

"Keyboard is 10 out of 10Mouse is 2 out of 10  The mouse quit working after a week...i've only used it for about 55+ hours of mostly web browsing. The LEDs work fine but the laser thing on the bottom that's for picking up mouse movement, it's always off now and the mouse doesn't move anymore. The mouse left and right buttons don't work now either!!! Never again will I buy anything that's from Red Dragon!!! Bottom line is that the mouse stopped working completely after a week!!!",1,1,2015-12-13,1,1,0

"i purchased this product hoping i could get away with buying the mouse and keyboard separately. and i was more than amazed when i got this product! what blew me away was the mouse and how amazing it worked and how perfectly i got it to do everything i needed. however here is the down side to this product... as soon as i plugged in my keyboard my computer went haywire. my mouse was still moving but the clicks weren't registering. the keyboard was obviously on because the back light was on, but the keyboard wasn't connected. i know right! how does a keyboard plug in and turn on but not be connected? well it was actually connecting once i turned the volume up, but immediately following its connection was a disconnect sound. and it repeated this action til i either unplugged it or turn my computer off. the mouse i would definitely buy SEPARATE from the keyboard and the keyboard is a malfunctioning heaven. im hoping to either get it replaced, or partially refunded.",1,1,2015-8-10,1,5,0

Now imagine that size keyboard but with a number pad and the same amount of buttons as a normal keyboard.Now it will cost me $10 to ship it back AND I already had to pay the $8-10 to ship it to my house (which isn't refunded) ..

"I purchased this for my desk job that I recently got, and when everything came in I was more than excited to have it finally here. I opened the brown amazon box to be greeted by beautiful packaging that seemed more than inviting to a quality mouse and keyboard on the cheap. I looked over the box and with my amazement it looked intact! No dings, no scratches, nothing harmful ever to occur to this box! I proceeded to grab a razor and slip over the few pieces of circular tape that kept this baby shut. After the tape was off, I pulled the cardboard tabs out and lifted upwards. The keyboard was beautiful, it was just as perfect as I had imagined it would be. The keyboard was sleek and black with a beautiful tactile feeling of a slight spring underneath, with no plastic feeling in site I felt the world was mine!  I turned to the mouse and felt it over, the same glorious rough feeling like it was a mouse to be reckoned with called from within it. I thought to myself, ""Wow this combo deal is astounding!"". I waited until the next day when I got into the office to actually try them out, that's when it all became a big mistake. The keyboard wouldn't hook up properly at first but I finally got it connected. Next came the mouse, I was excited about this piece the most, and perhaps why this rating has achieved a 1 star outlook. I uncoil the mouses beautifully braided cord, and hook it behind the computer, and to my vast time spent waiting for it to ship here, nothing happened. Absolutely nothing, it was a completely defective mouse right out of the box. What a damn shame too. I really felt like it would have been a solid 5 stars if the equipment they sent me would have worked in the beginning but here we are now. A defective mouse, and another distributor I can't trust.

I could have sworn I bought a more expensive version of the red dragons keyboard and didn't have these issues. The keys we're even a smooth finish not this cheap plastic feel. This whole thing feels like a knock-off to be quite honest.

True, it's not a Macintosh ""Chiclets"" keyboard, but I've never mistyped this much just from changing a keyboard (and not because of the inexplicable placement of the backslash, that's my bad for not noticing that in the photos). And I get having the WASD keys have arrows and being a different color, but what's with the inverted-T directional keys (below the Insert,Delete,Home,End,etc keys) also having ""W"" ""A"" ""S"" ""D"" on them? I mean .. why?The mouse is ok, nothing special, but there was no way to reassign the browser back/forth buttons, which is a real pain if you're not conditioned to them. Fortunately the Device Manager seemed to think it was a ELECOM mouse, and their ""Mouse Assistant"" app did the trick. Just how flimsy would this mouse be without the little weights inside?",2,1,2016-8-9,1,1,1
"The listed customer reviews on this product are in terrible order and misleading, furthermore they could cause the return of many items which are in perfect working order. Customer are listing features that do NOT exist in the Redragon S101 Keyboard/mouse combo.- there is not keys backlight, there is no switch to turn the decorative lights off -they stay on even after your computer shuts down, there is no way to change the colors on the decorative red LEDs, there is no circular red button to change ?/ anywhere on the keyboard. ETC, ETC. Either the customer are listing their reviews incorrectly or Amazon is sorting them wrong.With that out of the way... my assessment for the Redragon S101 VAJRA gaming keyboard CENTROPHORUS USB Gaming Mouse, Keyboard Set",1,1,2015-7-20,1,9,0

"Awkward and clunky , this keyboard feels more like a child’s toy to me. It’s also very loud . Yes the lights are pretty , once you get over than , using the keyboard becomes more of a chore than anything else . Also , if don’t gave the keyboard directly under you , the lit letters are extremely difficult to read .. even with the bottom prop-up legs I have mine on a few pieces of wood . As far as the mouse goes , eh it’s ok . I find it slightly large and cumbersome .. way too many buttons and kind of heavy . I overall give this keyboard and mouse a thumbs down — glad it came free with the cyber power Pc I just got ; I’m ordereinv a better keyboard - just wanted to let anyone who is used to nice feeling or flat style keys as in Mac keyboards , this keyboard is such a far jump it’s literallly annoying and almost impossible to get used to . The loud typing is driving me up the wall too. Ooo such pretty lights though !! Who cares ...",1,0,2018-8-12,1,1,0
"So I decided to purchase this keyboard simply because my old one had broken. (It was a very basic keyboard.) And I just gotta say, I am VERY pleased with the product with only two gripes!It looks cool, with the various different color patterns available and the overall design of the keyboard itself, it feels right, being VERY comfortable to use, it is relatively small and compact as all keyboards should be (it'd fit PERFECTLY in any desk with a keyboard slot, no matter how tight!), and it is also really quiet when typing.",4,0,2019-9-8,1,0,0
"I received this as a Christmas gift and I'm very content with it. It has different RGB settings that you can use by pressing the 'FN' key plus any of the button combinations listed in the user manual (there is a PDF version on their website @ redragonusa.com/downloads). Most of the buttons type well and are not too loud compared to the gaming keyboard that came with my computer. However, there is a slight problem with both the 'Backspace' button and the '0' button on the number pad. They both stick and sometimes won't actually type their given functions. Just a tad bit important that they function correctly, no big deal.All in all, it's not a bad keyboard/mouse combo and I actually enjoy the mouse. You can download the driver from their website and change the DPI settings as well as how often the light fades in and out. The only downside is that it's just one color so it doesn't have the cool RGB lights like the keyboard does.",4,0,2019-1-4,1,0,0
"I have tried numerous keyboards.  Every one seems to 'wear out' the key letters.  Especially the sdf area due to gaming.This product just works.  I LOVE how the back light works.

"The mouse works fine, but the keyboard is cheap. Both of the Shift keys don't work, and the ""lights"" for the caps lock, number lock, and scroll lock are not actually lights. They are just painted on. Overall not worth the money.",1,1,2015-2-10,1,4,0
"If I could give zero stars, I would. First off, I bought my keyboard back in October. (I have had keyboards last me years before needing to replace them. I am someone who takes great care of their electronics. I still have the same mouse from 2010. It works amazingly still.)Anyway, the keyboard and headset from this bundle stopped working. The keyboard lights weren't working as well and the buttons weren't registering when clicked. So I would have to press hard on certain buttons, namely the space key, to get it to work. The headset was never used. The headset I had prior finally gave out, (after four years), and I decided to use the headset that came with this bundle. Well.. I could hear nothing out of it at all. I tried hooking the headset up to my PC, my phone, my laptop, and it still wouldn't register any sound.",1,0,2019-5-28,1,0,0
"They keyboard is very nice and I have no trouble using it. The mouse, however, was the peak of my happiness. The mouse was faster and more responsive then my last mouse. Plus, it has two side buttons and I can now play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive without blaming my mouse for the deaths I accumulate. The lights are permanent, which means you cannot turn them off. However, they are not too dim nor too bright. So, having them on all of the time isn't a bother. Also, I love the dragon designs on both the mouse and the keyboard. Plus, the WASD and arrow keys both say WASD and are both painted red. I believe there was a review that complained about painted on lights? Well, I don't know what that person was talking about, because I fully enjoy using both the keyboard and mouse. To add on, the box it came in is fabulous. The design looks fantastic and it looks like a legit gaming keyboard. Now, at first, it does feel a bit cheap. Like the ones you would use in high school and even in college. However, after a week or two of using this keyboard and mouse, I see no problems nor feel them.I loved this purchase and would buy from this company again!",5,1,2015-3-3,1,6,1

My old keyboard was just a regular dell keyboard or whatever that got a lot of gunk and junk from years of use. The keys started not working so I thought it was time to buy a new one. I looked around and saw this one among all the others and settled with this one that has good reviews at a decent price.Here is the breakdown:,4,0,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"This keyboard and mouse combo is a great deal for $35, and if you need a good keyboard and mouse combo that doesn't cost a lot of money, then this is one of the top options for you if you want something a step aboveKeyboard: It isn't perfect, but it's got a ton of features like true RGB backlighting that's highly customizable.  It does flex a bit like most modern keyboards, but for a rubber-dome keyboard, the keys feel great and make a satisfying sound.  And with N-key rollover, it makes for a fantastic gaming keyboard for those on a tight budget or who don't want a higher-end keyboard.",5,0,2019-4-5,1,0,0
"so being new to the PC master race, i decided i needed to get a RGB af mouse and keyboard. on this point i was not disappointed. both the mouse and keyboard light up really well and the keys are even backlit.the mouse has 2 side buttons which are programmable if you can get the redragon software to actually work. i could not. however the buttons are not mapped to the keyboard so all of the games i tested had the ability to map them to the function i needed them for.",4,0,2018-2-18,1,0,0
"On first use of this keyboard and mouse combo, I instantly fell in love with it.The buttons are smooth and firm- they don't stick or slip and they have a great feel to them. The mouse was set at a fast mode at first and it made me panic a bit since I'm not too adept at tweaking DPI settings yet. However, this mouse made it insanely easy. The middle arrow button is the DPI button and it cycles through 4 different speeds:",5,0,2017-8-28,1,1,0
"When I bought my custom gaming pc, I was given this set for free as part of the deal going on at the time. I immediately just threw it in my closet because as a hardcore gamer, I was set in my ways with a couple other keyboards already. However, I had an old gaming laptop I broke out and began to use on my travels, however the built in keyboard is dead so it requires me to use another one instead. Finally, I broke this keyboard out to give it a quick run so here is a fresh review as I am still trying to get a feel for this. Right away I feel the board is overall too flat for my liking. I like a bit more of a raised key row but its not bad.The keyboard itself is very lightweight. It makes it great to take on trips because it doesn't add much to the bag of bricks that is my laptop. The mouse itself is decent as well. It fits nicely in my hand and has a few extra buttons compared to a standard mouse but for hardcore gaming and mmos, I would stick with my razer mouse instead (you can find it in my reviews). Its very lightweight even when I add weights to it, it just feels too light for my liking. Some people do like the feel of it so if its your thing, good news.",3,0,2016-10-17,1,0,0
"I bought this for my hubby as an early birthday gift. I am not one to go on and on in leaving a review but man I love this!

I read the reviews on here and thought ""  Wow this looks pretty cool and most reviews were great so I wanted to give it a shot. I can tell you, I am ecstatic that I bought this! He absolutely loves it. Hooked it up to his Xbox One, works great! We love that it lights up. Gorgeous! LolWe had to move the table and couch a little closer because the cord isn't really long but that's okay. And hey now my living room looks better!  😁",5,0,2019-10-30,1,0,1
"The keyboard is indeed quite quiet and feels somewhat satisfying to type on, though the quality of the plastic may be lacking a little. However, though the mouse's build quality is much higher than that of the keyboard, the mouse's wire is far too stiff and is not that comfortable to hold. However, given its price at ~$30, this combo is not bad if you're looking for a mouse and keyboard on a budget, though I would recommend getting a Logitech G602, which I got on sale for $30, which I think is muuuch more comfortable. BTW: The mouse includes mouse weights which are really nice.",4,0,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"30 bucks for both the keyboard and mouse??? Now I know it sounds like a lie seeing as how now days most gaming keyeboards start off in the $80’s and up but this is honestly a steal. The keyboard is great, the material doesn’t feel like crap cheap plastic from the dollar store and the RGB lights are easy to switch on and off and they look great when on, it’s pretty solid and the cables are good too. The mouse is pretty good too, the quality of it doesn’t feel as good as the keyboard but it’s still solid. Overall you can’t really beat the price of this deal and if it sucks ir you hate it, it only cost $30 bucks and you can always return it.",4,0,2018-10-16,1,1,0
"For the price (got it during a flash deal) can't complain, the mouse comes with extra weights and can control dpi. The keyboard is comfy and feels solid, does not click like the mechanical ones but I don't really miss nor want the mechanical ones anymore after having this one. The mechanical ones get kinda noisy especially at night if your the only one awake and everybody else is sleeping.Only cons might be the mouse only glows in and out red, mouse setting changes back to the slow one once computer restarts.",5,0,2018-6-17,1,1,0

"I've read many books in my life, not many being fantasy(Robert Howard being the exception) But of all the books I've read this is by far the most detailed story of the lot, and that includes Hemingway and even Homer. Hemingway's battle and retreat at Caporetto leaves nothing on the battlefield of Minas Tirith. And while one may say that I am comparing fiction and fact, that isn't the point. The story blurs the line between fact and fiction and almost seems like it did happen and you are reading a first hand account of history.Also, every major character in the story and even most of the secondaries are given a detailed background and full depth. Very rare for most novels. The character Aragorn is as complex a person you will find in literature. He has known happiness and grief, hard toil and loss. You get a true sense of the life he has led. All of the players are given such treatment and while it's been said that the women are given less importance than the men many point out that three of the strongest characters in the book, Eowyn, Arwen, and Galadriel are women.",5,0,2020-7-3,1,0,0
Great keyboard and mouse.Fits a aesthetically very well with my set up and is gorgeous. The cords have never given me trouble and are long enough to reach from my actual Tower to my desk with enough room to swing my mouse around. It feels great to type and game on.

"I wouldn't consider myself a gaming keyboard connoisseur but I'm not very impressed with this keyboard. The colors are too dim in my opinion, and the keys seem to be a bit sticky. For the price tag, this is probably fine for someone who is just starting to game or who has never had a backlit keyboard before, but as a previous Razer Cynosa owner, this just doesn't do it for me.My biggest pet peeve with this keyboard is that some of the keys are only ""half lit"" whereas the top half is quite a bit darker in comparison to the rest of the key. This shows more prominently on some keys over others. And yes....I have increased the brightness as much as I can.",2,0,2020-6-10,1,1,1
"The keyboard is good enough, just not great.  The mouse left and right buttons are too close to the center wheel button.  While gaming, I use the center wheel for aim switching and weapon selection.  I find it hard to press the wheel without also pressing a left or right button during competition.  I also get the impression sometimes that when I am pressing a button the mouse stops tracking position.  Not sure if this is true.  Just me impression.",1,0,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"This keyboard and mouse looks nice and the colors work well, though I could do without the blinking and cycling of colors in some modes as I am a writer and not a gamer. The light in the keyboard could be brighter as my last keyboard was much brighter but wasn't available any longer. Of all the lighted keyboards I have purchased, this is among the best because of the reliable working of the keys--no extra letters appearing with one stroke.",5,0,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"The keyboard has some awesome lighting combos. It's comfortable and the keys aren't loud. However the space bar is extremely difficult to actually push down compared to how it's supposed to be. The lights aren't as bright as they could be with them turned all the way up. There is no instructions that come with it so you have to look it up. The cords for the mouse and keyboard are braided so they will last quite a while. All in all, it was worth the price.",4,0,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"I love the look of this keyboard. It looks like an expensive gaming mechanical keyboard, but it actually costs under 30 dollars. It is NOT mechanical, but honestly, what under 30 dollar keyboard is? The keyboard is plenty comfortable to type on, and I like it how the WASD and arrow keys are colored, so that way I can quickly know where they are. The mouse, although it looks uncomfortable, is actually extremely comfortable to use. I love it how there are back and forth arrows on the left side of the mouse, to easily go back and forth between web pages. The keyboard and mouse are extremely responsive in games, and the keyboard is designed well enough to where I rarely miss the correct keys when gaming and typing. A lot of newer keyboards ditch putting the caps lock, num lock, and scroll lock lights, but this keyboard has then, which is another thing I like.I was under the impression, however, that this keyboard would come back-lit, due to the product description, saying this keyboard has LED lighting. My mistake. Only their logo, and red dashes at the bottom of the keyboard are lit. Just a fair warning.",4,0,2016-2-16,1,0,0
"The keyboard is good, the mouse is great for everyday use, I had no problems what so ever since day one but, you can’t save the LED setting It resets after shutdown the computer.

"I've had a couple of gaming keyboards at this point. Most of them were named brand keyboards and they all preformed great. I will say for this keyboard that it is not a mechanical keyboard. If that is what you are looking for, then this is not the board for you. However, this is a great budget buy and the keyboard feels very comfortable. My fiance bought me this bundle as a gift and I love it. I have not used the mouse yet, so I cannot speak on the mouse but in my hand, it feels like the older Razer Deathadder mouses. If you are looking for a budget buy, this is a great price for a pretty quality keyboard. I've been running it pretty hard for almost a year now and there hasn't been any key failures or whatnot. Nothing seems to be giving out either.",4,0,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"I lived in China for nearly 6 years, so the 红龙 (Red Dragon) name and from what I found in shops in China, basically let me know why this item is cheaper than many gaming keyboards, however, the quality is still great. I love the feel of the keys, they press smoothly and quietly but still have that crisp feel I like. Having the red directional keys has already saved me several times. The mouse combo is wonderful, so I didn't have to go looking somewhere else for a matching mouse and I love the texture feel on it, and the scroll wheel feels nice and smooth. The braided cords are a nice touch, no more annoyingly loud scraping of wire on the desk (I prefer wire connection so this is a plus). It's lit on some parts but not the whole keyboard, which I actually prefer.All-in-all, very affordable, great quality, nice looks, nice feel, super satisfied.",5,0,2016-8-14,1,0,0

"There are so many options for the keyboard. You can change the speeds and the brightness to various settings. You can use breathing mode or you can disable it. You can also have multiple colors flashing at the same time or have different colors at a time. You can have just one color- there are too many options. The different options are shown in the manual. It feels nice on your fingers and it looks professional. The colors do not hurt your eyes at all. However, the corners of the keyboard has little knobs to keep grip. My desk is white, so sometimes, it scrapes across my desk and turns it black. However, I can just clean it out. This shouldn't be a giant problem because you shouldn't be moving your keyboard really hard. It is not a giant deal. The mouse feels great and you can even adjust the weight on the mouse to whatever you want. The DPI comes in four settings. This product is great.",5,0,2018-8-21,1,0,0
"This isnt a bad setup for the price.  If youre new to computer gaming or on a budget,  I would highly recommend this for you.

The enter key on the keyboard itself was offset a bit to the side compared to most of the keyboards I've used, which took a while to get used to, but this was a quick adjustment.

Then the mouse, it was working out, for about a week. Then, all of the sudden, left click is constantly pressed or constantly being pressed at a rapid rate. And I don't mean physically.

"Note: Not purchased on this account, it was a gift for Christmas. I received my keyboard and mouse and it was alright, until a day after. They keys gradually got mushy and a sorta sticky feeling. My brother's keyboard and mouse are a lot better compared to mine, its the same mouse/keyboard and a lot older. So I assume this is just a rare occasion. The mouse is great, but the scroll wheel is also a bit weak and cheap feeling. So if you are on a budget this is a great deal.",3,0,2017-6-1,1,0,0

I bought this yesterday and literally unboxed it about 10 minutes ago and I already love it. It’s very useful in low light situations especially when gaming. My roommate has a sensitivity to light and I have to keep the light off whenever I’m playing games on my computer so this keyboard allows me to still be able to see the keys. As I already said I love it even though I’ve only used it for 10 minutes.,4,0,2019-3-19,1,0,0
"Perfect for the price, LED's are neat, especially all the options you get on the keyboard. Keys are a little loud but nothing major. Mouse has a good weight to it (and can be made lighter by taking weights out) and a solid DPI button to swap between 800, 1600, 2400, and 3200, indicated by how fast the light pulses. Slight issue with left CTRL; since this is designed to be a gaming keyboard, many shortcuts involving left CTRL are unusable, since CTRL is disabled for them. Right CTRL however still works just fine for commands like Task Manager and such. Overall, a great buy I would highly recommend.",4,0,2017-11-15,1,0,0

"So I feel super conflicted with this. The keyboard is fantastic. It’s a great beginner gamer keyboard and the atmospheric lighting is beautiful. HOWEVER, the mouse arrived misaligned. I wasn’t able to click the mouse buttons and had to realign the buttons so they would click. It took a ton of work because of the design of the mouse. It was incredibly frustrating.",2,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0

I love this keyboard and mouse combo. I decided to buy this combo and a monitor because I was playing on a PS4 with a TV and I thought it was time to get something nicer. I love the deferent colors and how you can change the brightness. I’ve had no issues at all. The LED backlight isn’t the brightest but it is definitely bright enough for the job. The keys feel light and smooth. The mouse is great and everything is perfect. I highly recommend this keyboard and mouse. Especially for the price. 10/10.,5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0

"I initially got this for a Xmas gift for my sister and she was ecstatic when she opened her gift. I was impressed with it when she had it all setup on her computer. The keystroke was nice and smooth and no loud clicking sounds like a mechanical keyboard, mind you it still makes a little keyboard stroke sound. The backlit light adds a special touch, especially if you're playing games with minimal lighting. You can set the light to either one tone ie. blue, yellow, red etc.. or a rainbow pattern that flashes across the keyboard. You can also set the speed of the flow of the light as well.The only problem is the wrist rest, it's small so it doesn't cover your entire wrist. It comes up to your palm and that's it. I used a wireless Logitech keyboard which provided a generous amount of space with its wrist rest. However this is a gaming keyboard so you might want to see if the ergonomics fits your style of playing. So far I don't have any problems with it. The mouse ergonomically fitted my hand perfectly not to mention the material provided a nice touch and grip. The braided wire added a special touch and rugged feeling. The mouse offers a 3000 DPI as well 4 level of DPI adjustment.  Having said my piece... I was taken by how it performed, look and feel that I ordered another one for myself. I got this keyboard for half the price, so if you're in the market for a decent yet affordable keyboard, I recommend getting this while it last/ on sale.",5,1,2018-12-30,0,5,1
"Great thing with this is that you get lots of customization with the RGB lighting for the keyboard and mouse. It's pretty cheap and the mouse has individual weights you can add or take away to customize the weight. You can also customize the dpi. But that's about the extent of the good stuff, including the cheap price for this set.For the bad, the build quality blows. Made from cheap plastic, with cheap packaging (which I don't mind as much). The keys for the mouse and keyboard does not give good response, they feel mushy. The mouse doesn't have RGB, only red colour. The mouse also doesn't feel comfortable at all in the hand,  and the mouse aethetics doesn't match the keyboard at all. It looks mismatched.",3,1,2020-2-25,0,3,0
"This is a very good looking combo set, especially because of the LED lights coming out of both keyboard and mouse. Both wires are long & sturdyThe typing sound is not very loud.

Played Csgo with it for 400+ hrs.Mouse is excellent. No issues bout that.,4,1,2017-3-12,0,7,0
"I can't really complain about anything with this combo. The only things that I would have liked to have would be RGB leds in the mouse, so that you could match it with the keyboard. As it stands you kind of have to have the keyboard running a red or white colour, otherwise the glowing red mouse looks kind of odd beside the keyboard. If you download the drivers from the Redragon website you can disable the red mouse lights if you want, but the mouse, mouse cord, and keyboard logo all still use a red colour, which don't really match with any other keyboard led colours.The only other thing I wish this keyboard had was dedicated volume keys; instead it has dedicated sleep and power-off keys, and others. I really don't understand why anyone would need a keyboard shortcut to turn off their PC, so it's annoying this was a priority over much more common shortcuts.",4,1,2018-12-29,0,2,0
"Ok. First off. I'm picky. I've got that mouse in my hand all day. I didn't like it. You might. It looks really cool. But for me it sat too low to the ground if you know what I mean. I like to pick it up, use it on my leg, put it back down and use it right away. When it skips or misses I loose track of my thoughts....  I'll buy a better quality mouse - my fault. But again, everyone else seems to think it's ok. Keyboard? ...um , no. No thank you. But again. I'm picky. I love the lights. It's easy to see in the dark which is what I wanted but the keys make me think of touching something squishy that shouldn't BE squishy... I like a difinitive click or at least a reasonable facsimile. This is not that. That being said I have a couple Microsoft keyboards  that feel exactly the same . But that's why I bought another one... Good price, but not for me. Within the first five minutes I was pressing the keys beside each and typing like a klutz. The odd key press yeilds a squishy nothing at all and that to me on a new keyboard is unacceptable. You might love it but I think if you sit at it for more than twenty minutes a day you should aim a bit higher. 2.5 out of five. For me. 2 cause the mouse sucks too. For me.  It came fast... Oh, and. 6 programmable buttons? Really? Really? How? There's no software that I could find and when I tried to get the Microsoft m&k center software to work with it I swear I heard hushed laughter from inside my computer.... I tried to find something to program the mouse buttons but no. Nothing. So if you want to do something besides go back forward or launch your pointer into God knows where with that center button... Look for something that SAYS it includes software. NOT  something that says it "" works with anything"" .  The company itself? I'm thinking about buying a kb from them that's a little higher up, so they seem to me to have good quality in their better items.  Again. I am very picky. If your not, Amazon is the place to try it out. They will take it back if you don't like it.",3,1,2019-12-28,0,0,0
"I bought this primarily for the keyboard. The mouse works fine. Keyboard has great settings and I like the feel of the keys as I type. I chose this keyboard over two other similar backlit ones because of the way it feels when I type and the ease of use for the back light settings. I'm taking a star away because I think the shape of the keyboard is a bit bulky. I think they could have packed this thing down to a slimmer more minimalist design. Overall, I'm pretty happy with this purchase and I would buy it again.",4,1,2019-3-7,0,1,0
"Ok, so it's not a first-rate, highest-quality keyboard, but then it doesn't cost like one, either. It's worked out very well for my 14-yr-old son who games about an hour a day. He's not a rabid gamer, so this is perfect. And he really likes the cool light-up effect. We are using it on a Mac and, two months in, he has only had to work around the @ key which is mapped somewhere else, in non-mac position. Other than that, for his purposes, at least (quite a few games, and typing reports)  the keyboard works great.",5,1,2020-2-7,0,0,0

"I had seen some reviews about the bad quality of the keyboard. And the a lot of good reviews were particularly complimenting more the mouse than the keyboard, which made me skeptical about buying it, but I did. Now, there are 2 major issues and one minor issue.The keyboard turns off for 2 seconds whenever I'm writing at a faster pace, which is very bad when we're talking about a keyboard made for gaming. It also turns off for 2 seconds when i try to write the @ character (shift + '2' key pressed), and when it's back on it considers the Shift key always pressed, and only by pressing the shift key again does this stop.",2,1,2016-9-24,0,1,0

To use the LEDs press FN along with page down to turn the LEDs on and off. Home will cycle though the colors green, pink, yellow, teal, white, blue and red. Page up will make the rainbow pattern appear, which repeatedly pressing will change where each color is. End will make whatever color or the rainbow that is active pulse on and off. Insert will make the colors cycle between each other. Delete will make the rainbow move along the keyboard.",5,1,2018-7-8,0,2,0

My only complaint (which is so petty I'm not taking a star off) is that every time I restart my computer, I have to change the backlighting setting manually -- it doesn't remember your preferences between computer usage. Again, that's so minor, I'm not worried about it. It's just a matter of clicking a couple keys until I get it to my preferred setting. Not a big deal.

Much better for gaming especially, but I would even recommend it for non-gamers if u want a pretty, fairly good quality keyboard for a good price lol.Upon unboxing, I did notice maybe a third of the keys have what seems like... some sort of discolouration or something around the sides? Nothing comes off when I wipe at it, but it does have a somewhat more slippery texture I guess??? It’s not a dealbreaker or a big issue, honestly, I don’t really care or notice it (especially bc it’s on the sides of the keys anyway).

"The keyboard is pretty great, so far. It feels light and kind of... plastic out of the box, but once set on a desk it's got a solid and rather immobile sort of feel. The keys are quiet but firm, which I like. The mouse has a good, solid feel to it as well - the braided cord is a nice feature, and the texture of the buttons and overall feel of the mouse in my palm is perfect for something at this price-point. As a low-key gamer, having the extra buttons on the side is perfect. Any more than two and they would irritate me, but having the extra keys is great for binding them to the more important commands for various games. So far there are only 2 things that I would change or remove:1) The keyboard loses it's previous lighting setting when the computer is shut down. Sleep doesn't seem to revert it to default, but full shut-down puts it back to a sort of scrolling rainbow across the length of the surface. Not too bad of an issue though; there are preprogrammed quick keys to choose/cycle through the different options.",4,1,2019-1-8,0,0,0

Good:Great feeling keyboard and mouse. I have been using the keyboard for a year now with no problems and still don't want to replace this thing. The color changing button is very handy for adjusting color on the fly while in a game or something. Mouse had a really great mouse button finish on it that I want on all of my mouses. The buttons on the mouse also work very well and give off a very satisfying click. Mouse wheel feels controlled and not loose which is a big pet peeve of mine. Both of the items look bad ass and over all the keyboard works well.,5,1,2019-1-29,0,0,0

"Thought it was a good deal as everything worked perfect when new. Doesn't feel too cheap either given the price. However, the scroll wheel on the mouse started malfunctioning after about 5 months of regular use - I didn't even press on it that often, just scrolling up and down doing normal average browsing - and now it doesn't register the scrolling properly. Sometimes it scrolls up when it's supposed to scroll down and vice versa, and sometimes it doesn't scroll at all. Very frustrating.The keyboard is still working as intended though.",4,1,2019-1-27,0,0,0
Great keyboard and mouse combo. The first issue I have with the keyboard is how it feels like the keys are closer together which brings the overall length of the board down and causes some awkward typos and having to get used to the space bar.I would not recommend this combo for folks with big hands as the mouse is also quite small unless you claw-grip.,4,1,2016-1-4,0,2,0
"The mouse works great, the keyboard feels nice but has some problems; e.g. The LED cycles through 2 (sort of 3) colors on colorfade/solid color mode, and the volume is controlled by an FN command as opposed to dedicated buttons while there's buttons for things like calculator and refresh page. I'd say that it is worth what I paid for it, but it's not perfect.",4,1,2020-2-25,0,0,0

The keys are easily readable and placed in easy to reach and press keys , great layout . The keyboards size is rather small so it made playing with small hands much easier and also more fun. I like that it came back with a keyboard key switcher aswell don't see that often . The mouse was the best part the shape of the mouse was comfortable and the two front buttons (left and Right click) are a different material that offers grip so it was amazing to have that introduced to me . The two side buttons allowed for macroing in game which made the experience better and more fun for myself. One of the unique things about this set is the price it's an amazing deal for anyone who needs a decent wired computer keyboard and mouse . Incredible deal and best bang for your buck, but the cool thing is about the set is the actual cording it's not your standard cord material. Great work red dragon!",5,1,2016-4-15,0,1,0

"Purchased this unit in July 2018. The keyboard's backlight sometimes experiences some lag and won't change colors when prompted by the function + insert (or, delete) key. As well, the mouse's laser is poor and doesn't track my mousepad sometimes. Finally, the scroll wheel has ceased to function properly.I would not recommend this brand/unit.",2,1,2019-1-14,0,0,0

"Good keyboard and mouse combo, Solid keys that let you know when they are depressed. Feels rugged enough, I don't test my stuff by purposely throwing it on the floor but it sure feels solid even though it's light weight. There is a little twist when held at both ends and then purposely twisted. The feet pop out and allow it to sit stable.The keys are mechanical and I happen to prefer this to the soft keys that are so often used these days. They do have that mechanical sound when depressed letting you know you've hit a key. The action is good and there is no need to slam the keys all the way to the bottom to use them.",4,1,2016-3-24,0,3,1

"I bought this mouse/keyboard combo with the intention of using it for gaming, but had an accident with my primary keyboard and am using this for daily productivity as well.The good: The quality of the construction of both mouse and kb is good for the price. I don't find the keyboard lights offensive because I use them in a wet lit room. Aesthetically, your average 12-14 year old boy will probably love it. Having WASD keys in a different colour helps when gaming if you lose your place. Typing action is very quiet, if that's important to you. The mouse is actually quite good. Smooth tracking, positive clicking action and predictable scrolling. The materials are lower in quality than more expensive mice, but it's good nonetheless and I've never found myself wishing I had a fancier mouse.",3,1,2017-7-19,0,2,0
"I'm not impressed by this keyboard (though I do like the mouse), and had I had the chance to try it before buying it, I probably wouldn't have. It's fairly inexpensive, and the keys definitely let you know when they've been hit. Which is good. The LED can't be toggled on and off, however, which is annoying. I've taken to flipping my power bar off at night just to cut the supply to the keyboard and mouse. I loathe the placement of the ENTER key on this device. Mostly because I'm not used to it. It's an upgrade from the set I had before, but I wouldn't buy it again, if yanno what I mean. Too much hassle to return it though. So I'll keep it. I don't hate it enough to go through all that trouble. :P",3,1,2016-5-9,0,0,0

"Keyboard keys are a little tough at first, but that's to be expected they just have to be worked in a little. I like that you can change the colors, individual keys lit up different colors would be nice but for the price it's understandable why that is not an option. The mouse is nice, easy to adjust speed which is good since my 4 year old needs a slower mouse while I like it to move faster for gaming. I do not like the texture of the mouse however and the left click button squeaks, if not for these two things in particular I would have given 5 stars :( but for the $35 I paid it's a pretty good combo.",4,1,2018-4-6,0,0,0
"For $35 this keyboard and mouse combo is definitely worth it. Its not a mechanical keyboard, but I wasn't expecting it to be for this price.
