"I bought this PC after about a year of wanting to build/buy a PC. My original thought was to build my own, but after picking out everything I wanted on PC Part Picker, the build was about $200 more than this build (and I was trying to build with an i5 processor as well). I will say that my build might have been more expensive because I was trying to get a nice motherboard and PSU, and I do believe that this PC has a lower-end brand. Regardless, it's working as intended.The PC worked well out of the box and the fans and case look great with the RGB. If you are not RGB inclined, it is easy to turn off as well. The games look great and I was able to load into heavily computational games (such as 6+ player Civ VI) very quickly. I have played the following games in the week that I've had it: Civilization VI, Rainbow Six: Siege, Divinity: Original Sin 2, and Fallout: New Vegas. All of the games run smoothly and look great. The PC is pretty quiet - you can hear the fans a little bit if you have no sound on at all, but it is negligible once you are listening to something and it is impossible to hear if you have a headset on.",5,1,2020-4-28,1,1,0
"The machine arrived without any problems, could load up and boot quickly. Would've liked more detailed information. For example, had to download the drivers for the graphics cards and others.You get two DVDs with drivers, but the machine doesn't have a DVD and I don't have anywhere that can read them. And no instructions.",4,1,2020-9-26,1,1,0
"My first official gaming tower PC, wife got it for me for Christmas (Cyber Monday Deal). Arrived at my door in one piece with no damage to the box itself (shout out to USPS for that much).Enjoying it very much, a lot of my steam library is now running at 4K 60FPS Max settings. It’s a beast of a machine. Already have the 1Tb SDD almost completely full, looking to expand on that with an internal SSD of 2 or 4TB.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,1,1
"I bought this computer for my husband, a computer scientist, because he determined after extensive research that this machine would be powerful enough to run machine learning programs.  The combination of the powerful graphics card and the overall value clinched it, but of course it also needed the fans to cool down the CPU during high intensity use that you'd find either with gaming or the type of programs he runs/programs. He partitioned the drive to keep Windows but to mostly run Linux.  So far, the computer has run smoothly (there were a few minor hitches in the beginning) without overheating.We keep the computer on the floor with full air circulation around it because we feared placing it under the desk might lead to fan failure due to overworking.  Yes, it looks cool with all the colors in the see-through box, but it also reminds you of how many fans this machine needs.  The specs are high-end for the price but not truly high-end.  This computer offers a great value for the specs.  Because the drive is solid state, everything runs off it is faster than a non-gaming computer: gaming, streaming, and high-data programs.",4,1,2020-3-1,1,1,0
"This puppy came in today...got it setup then installed a Toshiba 8 TB... My best download Mbps was185...average download speed is around 135 Mbps. This is my second Cyberpowerpc, first one is almost 3 1/2 years old and still kicking.Update 9/4/2019: Motherboard utility was not installed so I have to do a temporary hook up of a DVD to load the utilities into the PC.",5,1,2019-9-2,1,4,1
"Purchased this as a Black Friday deal which was $250 less than normal price. Surprisingly, it arrived the next day. I paired this with a 32"" 1440p 144 Hz monitor. While Amazon provides the specs, the specific manufacturers of the different components were not advertised, perhaps to give Cyberpower more leeway in their supply chain. The graphics card was from Gigabyte which is good. The mother board was ASRock Z390 Phantom Gaming 4-CB. The 16GB of memory are set to 2666 even though Amazon shows 2400. With the liquid cooling and only an SSD drive, the system is relatively quiet (just the 3 main fans). The cabling is minimal and neatly organized. The system worked well right out of the box.This is my second Cyberpower system -- while I was quite happy with my prior one, I was annoyed that using a small SSD plus large HDD is challenging for Windows as it insists on putting all your personal files (eg. Documents) on the C drive which fills up quickly. You can work around it, which I did, but it forces you to have separate folders on C and D and to always remember to select the one you wanted (which is D, whereas Windows really wants you to pick C). Anyways, that problem is solved with this system by foregoing the HDD altogether.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,1,0

"You think you're getting a pretty good gaming pc. It will work just fine for about three months. Then BOOM need to reinstall windows. Ok, no biggie. A week later it again needed boot media. Ok, reinstall.A week later it happens again. So I contact Amazon tech support. The return window had just passed so there was nothing they could do. So here I am, nearly 2k wasted. Seriously, you'd have better luck gaming on a literal pile of dog poop.",1,1,2020-9-11,1,2,0
"After waiting many years my older i7-4820k was showing signs of its aging technology. I’m sure I could have gone a few more years with it but since I do CAD work, I also wanted to improve my 2 27” monitors showing the 3D graphics and expand using a 3rd 4k monitor. I knew my old 4GB GTX970 graphics card wouldn’t do the job as well. I first spent about a full day pricing out a new build at 3 different web sites and no matter how I did it which would have to include my labor, I couldn’t beat the price of this Liquid Cooled Cyberpower PC that had the i7-9700k CPU. It has little room to expand adding more fans and another video card. Search Onyxia II 242W Mid Tower Gaming case; emulates many other cases sold here on Amazon like FSP ATX Mid tower. Expandable yet only has room in either remaining drive bays of 2X3.5” OR 2X2.5” and it badly needs more USB ports. I use a 6TB external drive so I didn’t need the 1TB SS drive, too big and wish they had used the Optane Drive feature this MB is capable of when they built it but I can add up to 2 more M.2 type to this board if M key. Did order more RAM to double the 16GB DD4 3000MHz RAM it came with but seems to always have 10GB free anyway. No DVD RW in this but these days don’t need it; I do have an external portable USB type anyway. I have figured out how to OC the video card using the FireStorm software I got from their site. Just try and price out these parts alone. Just the Video Card, is 500 bucks on average and the CPU is around 400 bucks and this is not the 300 series 9th Generation CPU which scores less in performance I read. But this is how the unit bench-marked when I got it.Benchmark 2020-01-25",4,1,2020-2-20,1,0,1
"i bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday, along with an extra fan in case he had heat issues like some other reviews said. however, he has not had any heat issues whatsoever and is extremely happy with it. he plays games like monster hunter, destiny2, and others on 4k and at the highest settings, all running perfectly.it came with an addressable RBG thing.. just ignore that, if you're not experienced with building computers. just know that you dont need it to make the RBG's work, its basically just to control the RBGs through your computer instead of the little remote you get. 100% ignore it because it will only make you confused haha.",5,1,2019-12-2,1,1,0

"I know pre-built machines come with some anxiety over the parts lottery, but I snagged this on a deal expecting to have to upgrade a few things and fix the fans and cable setup. Here are my thoughts:1 - The box arrived quickly and was decently packed.",5,1,2019-9-2,1,1,0

I'm going to summarize what a lot of folks have already commented on and give you the specs.1. GOOD VALUE - This computer was an awesome deal with it's on-sale price.,3,1,2019-9-13,1,7,0
"The computer came in a box which delivered  in good condition.  After taking it out, the computer had no scratches or defects on visual inspection.  The graphics card, ram, Bluetooth adapter card and CPU were all correctly installed and fit in their place snuggly.  All the fans worked as the picture shows and it looks really nice.  It worked right out of the box as promised.  I updated the firmware for the motherboard because I saw others had issues with clock speeds.  The CD with some drivers wasn’t needed because ASUS website had all the drivers for everything.  The graphics card is from Gigabyte and is a 3 fan style model.  It has one mini display port two regular display ports and one regular HDMI port.  Despite all the fans in it, it is amazingly quiet.  So no issue there.Now the not so great.  The only issues I have are for the wiring, the power supply, the lack of ports for expansion, and the lack of sufficient cooling as a whole.",4,1,2019-9-11,1,4,1
"Negatives: Lights on the fans / cpu liquid cooling went out after the second day. Wifi card seemed to cut in and out as well, so ended up having to get an external one to fix that issue.Positives: Lightning fast. Pretty sleek spots for 2.5 SSD drives (so sleek in fact, that I didn't realize what they were for until after I attached them to brackets). Overall a great value for the price... I just get a little worried about having two things go wrong before the one month return window hits. Hopefully nothing else happens, but all and all barring anything else going wrong, I'm very happy with my purchase.",3,1,2019-10-9,1,1,1

"Sorry, spending $1500 on a PC to get a rattling tower back fan ruins this. There's another user review here showing himself screwing the back of the case to fix it. I tried that, it did not work. I called tech support, they sent me a tutorial on the front fans, I said it was the back CPU fan.I bought this $1500 pc with brand new everything precisely to not have to dig into the inside. What a let down that cheap components, APEVIA are the fans included were used.  Then the tech guy Raymond says I'd have to take the PC to best buy to get the fan worked on by Geek Squad or 3 weeks to send me a different system.

"This machine runs everything I have asked it to. I agree with the other reviews about the lack of attention in the build. This problem was caused by a fan striking the plastic shroud to the water cooler. After attempts with CyberpowerPC support (no help) I finally figured out where the noise was coming from, and simply backing the screws out a couple turns gave the clearance needed for the fan within the shroud. The point is this is an expensive desktop, and unless you have the knowledge and aptitude to trouble shoot some things, this may not be the computer for you.",3,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
Was available with free 1 day delivery. Great sale price. Arrived on time and well packed. Very clean and pro looking build. The familiar Asus mobo and MSI RTX card made it seem custom built. Window installation was embarrassing simple and it was updated and running in a very short time. So far it is running smooth and error free. It easily runs games at ultra max settings and at 4K resolution! It is practically silent and only spins up when gaming. Overall the case has no overheating issues and the sealed water cooler system is made of metal and not plastic. Very impressive. All in all it is a top end machine that would be difficult to build for the price. The easy set up and price make this a great deal.,5,1,2019-9-6,1,9,1
"The parts they picked are pretty decent, not the best by any means but better than some pre-builds i've seen. Packaging was pretty banged up and had some damage, So i was suspecting to see some damage on the system itself, Sure enough there was some minor damage to the case. The system it self seems to be running fine so far, although in gaming the system tends to run a bit hot, I don't think they did a good job on cooling the system, (might need to add a few more fans), There should have been at least another case fan on top vent. The ram is a bit low as well only 2400MHz (maybe 3000MHz would have been nice). Overall for the special pricing they had running on this for $1199 i can't complain or gripe too much, Only time will tell if the system holds up.",4,1,2019-9-7,1,9,1
"Amazing PC! Picked it up during a lightning sale and the price was relatively cheaper than buying the parts separately. Gone are the days that building your own PC is the cheapest option.Performance is great, benchmarks are top tier. I can run Ultra on every game I own. SSD is speedy, boots up within 5-10 seconds. No complaints here. The RAM is a bit on the slower side but all things considering it gets the job done for gaming. Cable management is good. The temperatures are cool.",5,1,2019-9-8,1,7,0
"I have read a lot of reviews on Cyberpower computers as well as other brands of prebuilds where customers complained about such problems as poor wiring management, cheap no name brand components, improperly configured cooling fans, operating systems not activated and play ready and a host of other problems.  I can only speak to my own experience and in doing so, I have to say that I have experienced none of those things.  The truth is that I pulled this pc out of the box, pulled out the packing foam, checked all the components to see that they were properly seated and then hooked it up to a monitor and to my home network and fired it up.  I have purchased a lot of computers in my life and built quite a few myself and this one was one of the most painless startups I have ever experienced!  everything worked absolutely perfect and the wiring looked very professional.  The components were all good brand names although not top of the line models, very decent when considering the price I paid for the entire package.  I can highly recommend this computer package from CyberPower.  I cannot guaranty that ever pc produce by CyberPower will be as flawless as this one but like I said, I can only speak from my own experience.Dennis",5,1,2019-11-19,1,7,1
"WOW! I don't normally write reviews but I am so impressed by this machine I'd like to share with others. After weeks of reading PC reviews I reluctantly purchased this CYBERPOWERPC Gamer Supreme Liquid Cool Gaming PC, Intel Core i7-9700K 3.6GHz, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 S. Received it 2 days ago and set-up went flawlessly. As expected I did have updates to complete which also went well. It takes slightly under 30 seconds for this PC to bootup and the SSD Drive is faster than I imagined. Yesterday I completed loading games including Red Dead Redemption 2 and the performance is amazing. I have built my own PCs in the past and considered doing it this time but I am now happy I didn't. Thanks for saving me from all the frustration Cyberpower!",5,1,2019-11-8,1,5,0
Positives: RGB looks spectacular. Fans are quiet. Computer is super fast for the price. Great for playing 3A titles at/near max settings.Cons: They give you a recovery CD when the computer has no disk drives??? So basically it's a coaster?,3,1,2019-12-22,1,0,1

"I received this desktop last weekend and didn't have too much time playing it yet. I tested it with CPUz, PC Mark10 demo and PerformanceTest 9. The CPU score in all those tests is significantly lower than the average 9700K score online. The difference is between 15%~30%. It's worse than 8700K and a little bit better than 7700. All other scores and parts are fine. I talked with CyberPower tech service and they suggest that all online scores are not a good reference. This is a stupid answer to me. I'll try to find out what exactly is wrong and update the review afterthat.",3,1,2019-9-5,1,8,0
"Unpacked the unit, made the connections and it powered up first time, ran through the Windows initialization, and I was off and gaming.  It took some time to download my first game, Dishonored 2, and it ran beautifully.  I built my last PC and kept it running for 10 years, but it finally gave up.  Looking into building a new one, this system seems to have quite a lot of technology (memory, CPU, graphics) for a decent price.  Similar systems from DELL, HP, and others all seemed higher for the same equipment.  I always had issues with my last PC overheating, but this one keeps nice and cool and makes just a small amount of noise.  I thought the circle lights would be distracting, but unless they are directly in front of you, I like the way it looks, like it's working away as the lights spin.  A remote is included to change the lighting pattern/color or to turn them off.  On the whole, I'm very happy with this purchase.  After a month no issues to report.",5,1,2020-3-14,1,3,0

"Edit - January 20, 2020I contacted Amazon for a replacement and unfortunately, the replacement had the exact same parts with the incorrect CPU.  When I returned the item one of the computers to Amazon.  They informed me that they couldn't do anything else.  So I contacted Cyberpower PC and they offered to receive to replace the CPU but I would have to mail it to them and be without a computer for a couple of weeks.  So.. they gave me a $100 Amazon Gift Card for the trouble.  I'm not exactly happy with the process but I feel better.  My recommendation is to purchase directly from Cyberpower PC website and ""customize"" a computer there rather than purchase a prebuilt computer at Amazon OR build your own desktop computer (which is what I will do after 1 year)....",3,1,2020-1-8,1,2,1
"Have had this for a little over 24 hours now.  Super quiet, stays cool even while playing current AAA titles with the graphics turned up.  No issues yet.  I can honestly say this is the cleanest (most empty) tower ever.  Lots of room for expansion and upgrades.  I really did not want all of the case fan lights but now that I have it, I have to admit that I love them.  There is a remote to shut the lights off if you do not want them on or you can use it to change the colors, speeds, cycles of the lights.  The only (minor) issue was the secondary drive was not setup.  Just a matter of going into disk management and setting it up there, but this could be an issue if it is something you are not familiar with.  In closing, I would definitely recommend this computer.  For the price, this was the best I could find.  My son is about due for a new one and I will likely buy from this same manufacturer for his as well.",5,1,2019-7-30,1,5,0
"I was a little hesitant to buy this gaming PC from some of the reviews, but I figured there is always a risk with any new rig you buy.  Dead parts happen, I am not a pro by any means but I can fix up some things.  Other reviews on what to do really helped with additional mods for this thing.I ordered a few Noctua fans, which, by the way are extremely quiet and efficient.  For the top - grab a 140x25mm fan.  You WILL need to adjust the liquid cooling screws on the back, slide them down while they are loose, and slide the Noctua fan in.  Tighten everything down, good to go.  Just be gentle as the wires come in right near the fan buy, so don't just ram it in there.  If you don't feel comfortable making any adjustments, grab a Noctua slim fan 120x15mm, and it will still mount in there fine.  The holes are for both types of fans.",5,1,2020-5-2,1,2,0
"When I first unboxed and turned on my PC, everything ran great.... for about 30 minutes. That's when I got my first blue screen. What followed was 2 days of endless customer support contact, YouTube videos, and headache. I even highly considered sending the PC back for a refund.However, if you stick through that headache and are able to fix the blue screens, this is an outstanding PC. I currently have mine overclocked at 4.8Ghz and I can play anything on highest settings with 100+FPS easily. Boot and load times are great. During hot summer days while playing demanding games such as AC: Odyssey, I haven't had temps that even hit 80 degrees celsius yet. I do plan on adding more fans for better airflow despite that, just for personal preference.",4,1,2020-8-11,1,3,0
"UPDATE: After a few hours messing around with this thing I'm in love. It's a beast. I can play FSX Steam maxed out at 4K. I attached a screenshot of the benchmark test from Forza Horizon 4. Again, every setting maxed at 4k with HDR and runs consistently over 100 fps. After about an hour of that abuse, GPU was at 72 C, CPU was at 40 C. It's laughed at everything I've thrown at it so far and I have yet to overclock anything. My only disappointment so far is that the mouse they sent arrived broken and I am missing the remote that controls the case LEDs altogether. I went directly to Cybepowerpc's website and their customer service team is happily sending replacements for both. I was pretty disappointed that while Amazon had no issues shipping this entire computer to my FPO box, CyberPowerPC would not let me register the computer using that address nor would they ship the replacement pieces out. It will be real interesting if I ever end up needing to mail it in for warranty issues. Fingers crossed that doesn't happen.Box arrived nested inside another box in great condition. I was worried about ordering this because I am overseas and I've received some seriously beat up boxes through our post office. To my surprise, the outer box was in pretty good shape and the inner box looks perfect. The computer was also very well padded inside the box and there's even packing inside the case itself to keep things from bouncing around. After reading some of the other reviews, I made sure to double-check all connections and all of mine seem to be seated properly and in the right spot. I've plugged it in and the lights came on but unfortunately Amazon hasn't shipped my monitor yet! I'll definitely hook it up to the TV later to check things out but for now my son is watching TV and I wanted to get this thing registered and reviewed so I can get my super sweet mouse pad...I'll update my review later",5,1,2019-9-17,1,2,1
"I ordered this PC for a friend who did not want to build his own PC and while I usually recommend building your own, I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of this machine. The case could have better airflow, but honestly, with most PC cases being about the aesthetic these days, it is not a huge problem considering how nice it looks especially with the amount of RGB fans that are included (the remote for the RGB is something I did not know I needed until I was setting it up for him, super convenient especially if your PC is under your desk but still in view like mine). If you are looking for a PC that can run most if not all games at high settings over 60 FPS @ 1440p, I would really recommend this PC if you are not confident enough to or just don't want to build your own. He is happy with it and I can approve it after tuning the fan speeds in the BIOS.",5,1,2020-1-18,1,1,0
"I live in Puerto Rico, got the computer, and within a month the fan started making terrible noises.

"Got this PC about a week ago, great shipping, it was protected to it arrived without any kind of damage. The case and the insides are absolutely beautiful: lots of RGB lights which will make your room look like a club at night, with a remote that allows you to change it to your will. PC is extremely powerful: has great specs for the price and can basically run any game at 1440p or even 4k, with newer and most-demanding games at over 60FPS.Although I'm generally very happy with it, there is one con: the airflow within the case is not great. I've been playing OW lately and the GPU gets to 83°C and throttles down. I've tried downloading AI Suite and turning the fans to the max but even then it eventually throttles. I have bought a couple of fans which I'll install soon, hopefully solving or at least improving the problem.",4,1,2019-9-14,1,3,0
"this thing is a beast for computing and gaming. The only issue was that you have to install an adaptor for the video. there is a 3 hole power supply at 5v that I was searching for and couldn't find. I decided to take the other side panel off to see if the tech that put it together might have mixed up the cables. There it was strapped to other cables. it was also too short, so I had to stick the VGA adapter to that closed side of the PC. not a big deal, but they should have made it simpler. I gave them 4 stars for that mix-up. overall, great PC.",4,1,2020-9-5,1,1,0
"Overall -I'm not an expert at PC's but I'm familiar enough to know that you aren't getting ripped off when you buy this. It runs amazing, it's not loud which is something I guess some people are concerned about. It isn't overpriced as I looked up all of the parts and its around the same price to build (again, not an expert, but from what I've seen this is accurate). You won't be part of the PC building club but you'll save a good amount of time not looking for what goes with what when building, not to mention the time it would take to make this look nice.Performance wise -  I'm coming from a laptop gaming computer from 2010 to this so this desktop is amazing for me. Zero problems with games like Warzone. No complaints whatsoever.",5,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0

"I bought this computer for a great price on Cyber Monday (December 2, 2019). It arrived the next day (faster then advertised) and was in excellent condition. The wires were all tight and connected. The packaging was excellent.

I know my way around a computer but am by no means tech-savvy. I was prompted for almost all updates and downloads, which took less than one hour to complete.

"I'm not a tech wiz or expert by any means, so take this review as coming from an enthusiast who knows the minimum.I believe this to be a very powerful rig. It runs any game I desire (flight sim, Arma 3, The Witcher 3, Modded Minecraft with Ray Tracing/Shaders) at incredible speeds and outstanding graphics quality. I have not experienced any lag or FPS issues in any of my games. The lights are cool, the computer is quiet, and I have nothing bad to say. I'm very happy with my purchase. The only thing I could recommend is to update your drivers manually, because a few of mine were a couple years old and this caused a brief issue. Specifically the wifi adapter driver needed to be updated. It stopped working on my out of nowhere and it took a bit to figure it out, but after updating it I have no issues. So overall, I am highly satisfied with this computer and it's my pride and joy as my first gaming PC.",5,1,2020-4-30,1,2,0

"Very awesome computer, just got it about 2 days ago and so far it’s been awesome, the rgb lights give it a nice feel and makes it look more cool and makes it look more of a gaming computer, so far it’s been doing very well, the price is not to much but it’s definitely not a budget PC this is more of a high tech gaming pc, that can be used for gaming and etc, the pc is very built neatly although some of the plugs get unplugged sometimes while being shipped because of the packaging so just make sure you make sure everything is tightened and plugged in the pc itself has a nice feel and is very cool it comes with a custom cyberpower keyboard and a rgb black mouse, as well as a plugin for the computer obviously, and it does NOT come with an hdmi cable, maybe it might come with one for you but when it arrived I didn’t see any, but it’s not that big of a deal because normally the monitor comes with an hdmi and a display port, the pc runs very well on CSGO, Fortnite, GTA and tons more but that’s all the games I tried it should run as good on any other game I reached around 230 FPS on fortnite and it can even go higher, it’s an awesome pc overall, for gamers, it’s also comes with an led remote to control and change the colors as well as the speed, awesome product.",5,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"I got the i9-9900K RTX-2700 version for video editing and 3D animation and I really couldn't be happier.  I had priced out a system with similar specs to build myself and was about ready to pull the trigger when this computer came out for Black Friday and the system was more power for less money than building it.  Plus I wouldn't get all the cool lights (which I don't need in any way, but when I do live streams and tutorials, it makes for a fun added visual element.)Adobe Premiere and Blender and everything else runs faster than it ever has.  I did opt to add more RAM.  Mine came with 16GB in two 8GB sticks.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
"I received this PC on June 22nd, 2020. It is currently August 4th, 2020, and I think it might finally be able to be used.After it arrived fairly quickly, I used it for one day, before it turned off on its own. After I turned it back on, it turned back off after a few minutes, and wouldn't turn back on. After realizing that the PDF on Amazon's page lists the wrong tech support hours (they close at 6 PM PST now, due to the virus, probably), I finally got ahold of tech support the next day.",3,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0
So ive built a few pcs in my life and this one is by far the best ive had. I opened it up first just to see the wiring and how they had it set up. Everything was neatly organized and in its place. Installed all my drivers and fired up a few games to see what it would do. I couldnt really be more impressed than i am with it so far. If anything changes i will resubmit my review. Here are a few of my Pros cons so far with the system.Pros- Really fast gaming pc for the price point,5,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
"I am VERY satisfied with my purchase.  I don’t think there is a better value out there for a desktop PC spec’d like this, or at least I wasn’t able to find it.  Piecing the components together on my own the cheapest I could get was around $1700, and I paid $1300 for this machine before taxes.  Bottom line up front, I recommend this PC to anyone in the market without hesitation and I would buy this PC again in a heartbeat.I've had this PC for just over a week and it's ran nonstop since I've set it up, without a single issue.  I read most of the reviews and was concerned there may be issues when I received mine or that substandard components may have been used (cables unplugged, fans not working, cheap hardware, etc.).  That is not the case with the PC I received.  The case is very well made and has lots of ventilation.  The color fans are pretty cool but were not a contributing factor to my decision but my 11 year old loves them.  The fans are quiet though which is a huge plus.  The MB is an AsRock Z390 Phantom Gaming 4 which has a very friendly BIOS that makes it easy to OC your processor and/or RAM, if that's your thing.  The RAM came as 2 x 8GB sticks of Patriot 3000MHz, the GTX 2070 Super video card is a Gigabyte, and the NVMe SSD is a WD Blue.  Plenty of USB ports on the back and two on the top front of the case and built in Wi-Fi as well as your standard audio in, out, mic jacks, old school mouse and keyboard plugs, and an RJ-45 ethernet connection.  It also has a USB-C port which I've seen on plenty of laptops but am not certain if it's standard equipment on desktops.  I did not crack open the power supply bay so I can’t tell you what make/model the power supply is.",5,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0
"I got the 9700k + 2070 Super.  It's a beast!  The packaging was fantastic.  It came with some sort of blown foam inside the case (it was all self contained, but it was a hassle to cut out).  I prefer this to having a heavy graphics card being held in just by a PCI slot, but it was a little annoying.Everything else was perfect!  The instructions included were clear, everything worked right out of the box, including the wifi.  The cables were done well, and I didn't have much trouble attaching my extra SSD and HDD to the available brackets on the case.",5,1,2020-3-30,1,1,0
"I wish I could give 4.5 stars. Overall, I'm very happy with this PC and the quality of the components used.  A very minor issue: there are two extra fan slots where case fans could be installed, one on the top and one on the bottom. I'm not sure why Cyberpower would use a case with extra empty slots rather than using a case without the slots , or just installing fans in them.  I ordered these fans (https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01G5I6MRK) after reading some other reviews that said they fit and they did, but warning: for me at least, it was a VERY tight fit on the top fan slot.  I'd recommend looking for fans that are a bit slimmer, and use the fans I mentioned as the maximum allowable width. Also had an issue with the graphics card overheating, but Cyberpower support was very fast to respond to my RMA request, and a new GPU arrived to my door less than 3 business days after they received the faulty one!  Other than those two issues, the case and (new) GPU are whisper quiet, the LED fans are pretty to look at, and temperatures are well within spec.",4,1,2020-6-3,1,1,0
"I bought it during sale and recieved with the parts I9-9900k Rtx 2070 super gigabyte Asus prime z390p 16gb ram, etc. Use it for a few days then the cpu fan started having those clicking sound call the cyber power customer service..... waited for one hour still no answer, the amazon customer service helped find a replacement fan for the pc instead of waiting longer.A week or use it started having those white screen and crashing I thought the gpu was giving out tried reinstalling drivers did not do anything, I switch it to the other PCI slot that stop the problem.",3,1,2019-10-3,1,1,0
"Overall this is a good pc for the money. I’m not good with building PCs nor do I know how to do this was convenient. The pros of this build is the fast processor. i9 9900k Runs my games with only max 25 - 30% cpu usage while getting good clock speeds. The graphics card Rtx 2070 super Msi version is good. I get an average of 100 + FPS on Gta v online and over 200+ on Apex legends. But... THE CONS... When I received this build two of my fans were not working nor was the rgb. It came with a rgb controller panel you had to install yourself with no instructions at all which took me hours to figure out. The heating is a big problem. My cpu gets around 85 Celsius and gpu the same. The case for this build isn’t well ventilated. The fans aren’t the best either. I would recommend getting a new water cooler along with new fans. Also, this mother board is... okay I guess but don’t plan on overclocking the cpu with it because it’s not the best motherboard.  So besides that and the loudness of the pc it runs good on the games I’ve tested.  Tips? Get a new Watercooler, pc case, and fans along with a motherboard and you should be good to go.",4,1,2019-12-7,1,2,0
"The only problem with this computer, using since Christmas day, was the internet / WiFi. I saw some reviews saying that it didnt install the drivers for WiFi or your GPU. I also saw some just not being able to use the internet at all.I had the no internet issue. At first i thought it was the drivers. I kept trying, since I got 2 monitors with this on Christmas, I got a WIFI ADAPTER that i didnt see.",4,1,2020-1-18,1,1,0
"Unpacked the unit, made the connections and it powered up first time, ran through the Windows initialization, and I was off and gaming. It took some time to download my first game, Dishonored 2, and it ran beautifully. I built my last PC and kept it running for 10 years, but it finally gave up. Looking into building a new one, this system seems to have quite a lot of technology (memory, CPU, graphics) for a decent price. Similar systems from DELL, HP, and others all seemed higher for the same equipment. I always had issues with my last PC overheating, but this one keeps nice and cool and makes just a small amount of noise. I thought the circle lights would be distracting, but unless they are directly in front of you, I like the way it looks, like it's working away as the lights spin. A remote is included to change the lighting pattern/color or to turn them off. On the whole, I'm very happy with this purchase. After a month no issues to report.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"This is a gaming beast.  I did a YT video on it and it seems Fortnite FPS is the measuring stick everyone wants to know.. so I popped into fortnight and on 1080, unlimited fps and using GEForce to slide settings to performance (reducing some graphics features but still looks amazing)... I never dipped below 300fps.  Yes you read that right.  90% of the time I was 340-380... maybe once in a close shootout it dipped to 310 or so.Its unbelievably quiet.  Never hear that its on.  Doesnt run hot for me, I havent changed a thing on this guy.  Fast SSD.  Turned it on, and it just worked.",5,1,2019-10-31,1,3,0
"Very happy with my lotto, Asrock z390 phantom, gigabyte x3 RTX 2070 super, WD 1tb NVMe SSD, CyberPower brand fans (has their sticker on them none the less). I just received this PC today, so i haven't put it to the test yet, but so far I'm happy and the PC itself is more quiet then a box fan. upon first inspection everything was plugged in tight, the wiring wasn't a mess either, whoever put mine together did a great job, other than the few screws that got stripped out, doesn't bother me though.update: 4 months later, I am still blown away with this machine, it does everything I have asked from it. heat has not been as big of an issue as it seems to have been for others. Im very happy with cyberpower and the PC they put together for me.",5,1,2020-4-27,1,2,1
"For some background, I have bought 5 pre-built gaming PCs over the years. My 2 kids and I are all heavy PC gamers, everything from StarCraft II to Fortnite. This PC exceeded my expectations. When looking for a new PC I debated doing my own build, when I priced out everything on part picker the cost was actually higher than the cost of this PC, and that was with me going cheap with some parts (no RGB lighting, cheapest case available and not buying storage). I was even more surprised when the PC came with 3000MHZ DDR4 instead of the 2400MHZ advertised.The customer service is even more exceptional. This PC came with 1tb M.2 SSD. I had planned to install some 2.5 SATA SSDs once it arrived. I noticed there were no extra SATA cables and contacted them to ask about it ( i realized after i contacted customer service that pre builds usually don't come with them) They immediately responded and are sent me SATA cables. I couldn't be happier with the customer service.",5,1,2020-5-4,1,1,0
"It's been 7 month's now that I've owned it and let me throw some facts at ya!Once ya get it ya want to make sure the ""power plan"" is on Balanced and not High Performance. Why? Because my PC without even overclocking it was running 77c-80c and the fans were as loud as crap.",4,1,2020-6-12,1,1,0
"I've been pricing parts to build as well as looking at pre-built computers for a while. When I saw this computer as the deal of the day with 0 reviews, I decided to take a chance. At an amazing price, I just couldn't pass this up...GPU: EVGA Nvidia RTX 2070 Super $520",3,1,2019-9-11,1,4,1
"The unit came dead on arrival. I made sure all the cables were properly connected as the included pamphlet asked and aside from some internal lights, the PC just stands there and does nothing.I will try and contact CyberpowerPC's customer support about this. Hopefully this could be resolved.",1,1,2019-9-9,1,7,0
I am seriously impressed by this machine!Out of the box I was amazed at the care that was taken to connect everything in the case and his the unnecessary cabling in the back plate. The LED fan lights are cool.,5,1,2020-9-25,1,1,0
I waited a while before writing this review to have time to test it out.Out of the box I could not get it to power up.  After checking all I could and still being unable to get it to power up I called the tech support number.  The tech was friendly and did all he could to get it to work .  But It was unsuccessful.  I was transferred to a very helpful Amazon rep who quickly arranged for an exchange.  Unfortunately I had to wait for a label. Return my unit. Then wait 2 weeks for a new one to arrive.  Layer that night before packing it up  I tried again to power it up.  To my surprise it came on.  Boy was I happy.  But shortly after getting into windows. It suddenly powered off on it's own.  I played with the power cord and learned it had a short in it.  I replaced it with a old one I had and it has been working every since.,5,1,2020-1-12,1,1,0
"Thankfully, unlike some others, my machine came exactly as advertised and with a tight build quality. In fact, it may be the best ready-built desktop PC I've ever bought.The machine worked straight out of the box with no modifications or special configuration. Clean install of Windows, with no bloatware or adware or other garbage, and everything reasonably configured—you'll just want to run Windows Update and then the GeForce Experience to download the latest video driver. Fans run fast and quiet, and have kept it cool so far. Everything is performing to spec, and I was even able to get VR running within an hour.",5,1,2019-12-2,1,1,0

However, I only got to do that for two weeks before it died and would not turn on for longer than 30 seconds.I called Cyberpower tech support and over the phone, we together could not fix it. They recommended I ship it to them so they could fix it for free. I was told over the phone that it would take only shipping time and 7 days or less to repair it, so I agreed.",1,1,2020-1-7,1,2,0
I purchased this system to get back into gaming after making do with an old Alienware Aurora R6 for several years and Oh Boy the performance increase is amazing.

"I purchased this machine for audio production. When it arrived my audio interface had a crackling noise. I was told it was because it was old and unsupported so I bought a new one. The new one wouldn't work at all. I spent a long time with tech support trying to get it to work. It would not. I bought another interface. it had crackling noise too. Again, hours and hours with tech support trying to get it to work. It would not. When we tried to tune the machine to increase spread it would not restart. The technician said that the processor was only working at a fraction of the speed that it should.CyberpowerPC said it was defective and needed to be shipped back for repair at a $90 shipping cost to me.

"If your computer starts to crash consistently with crazy colored squares all over the screen, you may in the same boat as me. The GPU started to act like it was overheating even at low temps. Reinstalling the drivers and checking the cables proved to be of no use.Hopefully I was just unlucky. The computer was great otherwise.",2,1,2019-9-5,1,6,0
"Yes, like every other PC enthusist, you could shop around and price out each part and build a new PC yourself for less, but if you don't have the time to do that, this machine is excellent. The AIO cooler works and even during a stress test, the temps never got above 80 degrees Celcius. I was consistently getting 100+ FPS in Destiny 2 with the highest settings. As far as build quality, all the parts were securely installed and the Windows OS only needed a few updates. There aren't a ton of USB 3.0 ports (five or six on the back and two on the top). The i9-9900k processor and the RTX 2070 Super are a major upgrade over my old system and I'm very happy with the purchase. Had a lot of trouble with shipping, but that is a UPS problem and not a product issue. Another great thing: no bloatware or unnecessary software.",5,1,2019-12-11,1,2,0

Startup was just turning PC on to set up WIFI, create a Microsoft Account and Windows Key was automatically registered. Still haven't found where the Key info since the GUI on this machine is different than it is on my laptop.

"I got this PC back in May 2020. This morning I woke up to a windows error that would not resolve itself. I rebooted and got an 'Insert Boot Media Error'. I went into the Bios and reset it to default, mind you there is only one hard drive in this PC. Still got the bootable media error. I shut down the PC for 10 minutes and it rebooted to windows. I am now worried that the SSD is going bad.After researching the problem most folks are saying adding stuff to the pc could cause this error, or it could be a bad SSD. I did not add anything to the PC since I got it. They only thing I have used it for is downloading and playing games I do not even surf the web on it, I use my old PC for that. I am current making a bootable ISO of windows 10 on a flashdrive in case the SSD is faulty and needs replacing. After doing some researching the review of the Phantom z390 mother board they used and the type of SSD wasn't very spectacular. I am beginning to regret not just building the PC myself. When it works, it plays games great. But after spending the kind of money I did I am not very comfortable after this morning.  I really wish they had included a flashdrive with windows on it for these situations. If the SSD had died and I did not have a backup of windows 10 I would not only have to get a new SSD but also a new copy of Windows. Wish I could say better things about it.",2,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"I bought this PC all the way back in Feburary 2020 before we knew the world would get crazy lol. It is has now been exactly 5 months since then and I have to say that I'm very pleased with this product. It's of course very fast and can run any game @60fps ultra settings on a 1080p set up. I don't have a 2k monitor nor one with 144hz but for 60fps/1080p gaming this works flawlessly. So yes I would recommend it.A few sidenotes I bought this when it was $1359 and at the time of the review it is $1869. For that price you probably want to build it yourself but maybe it's high because of covid or something, I'm not sure. Also I've heard the PSU for this thing is probably not too great so I wouldn't overclock this machine unless you buy a better one. That being said the heat management is great, I saw some reviews that said it was poor but I haven't dusted off my machine since I got it (I need to) and it's the middle of summer in Texas and my GPU temps haven't gotten above 50C and the CPU probably not above 50 or 60 at best.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,1
"Packaging was pretty good, kept everything from rattling around. Had no issues with installing drivers. I haven't installed the RGB control yet as I was uncertain how to do so, but so far the seemingly random assortment is good enough for me.

I should have returned it right then.But now its dead for good and on its way back to cyberpower for repair since my return window has closed.FYI-i tested EVERYTHING Except the mobo and cpu becauce i cant swap em.But a i7 9th gen just dont fail like this so i belive its mobo.so far cyberpower has been subpar at best.there wait times are long and only once out of five calls did i get someone i could understand,one guy could not even pronounce my state right or the return info.they offerd no troubleshooting options and seemed to have no faith in the pc that they built.THeres a sticker on back that says that the parts were tested but not the complete pc.I dont even know what to say about that.Right now i just have to wait for the repair and see what happens but im not impressed.next time around ill build my own pc.  UPDATE-tech surport confirmed bad mobo.It was a asrock z390 gaming pro 4 in my pc.UPDATE-8-17-2020.Got pc back with bad ram chip.tech surport swears they tested it but i had no video out of the box.somehow a ram chip died during the return shipping.no idea how.about a month later ive now lost the ethernet port.fried.i had to buy a usb ethernet adapter.i really hope this is not a sign of future mobo issues.im going to sell this thing before i lose my shirt on it and build my own.",1,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"Great performance! everything is ready upon arrival true plug and play definition. One thing that was not mentioned  on the instructions is to attach the WIFI antenna to the tower due the distance between the WIFI and my tower, I had a slight trouble connecting to the internet.

"As I said, I'm very happy with this computer's performance, my only issue is that it makes a an almost constant low frequency humming sound that is enough to drive me mad. I literally have to take breaks or it agitates me. Apparently you can't RMA it for low sounds, even though I'm 99% certain it shouldn't be making this sound. It's not a fan sound, it's a buzz or a hum of something else. If it had a regular HD I might think it was that, but it's a SSD. I'm not certain what to do, but I know I'm not the only one that experienced this, so I would not recommend this computer if you can find another brand for around the same price. I would honestly have paid $200 to $300 more if I didn't have this issue.",2,1,2020-1-17,1,2,0

"I have Built my own gaming PC,  and have owned Alienware, Velocity Micro, Falcon NW, Dell and Hypersonic-Pc (now ocz) and this was the best bang for the buck.  Excellent components.  All names you’d recognize, as well as a super clean build. Wiring was exceptional. Packaged nicely, except a stick of ram had fallen out (i can Deal). The case that has been shot down in reviews is quiet and very attractive. I added one fan that cost me $15 to the top of the case for continuity.  The Ram is 3000 MHz, and I got A 2 hb WD 7200 rpm sata off of Amazon and installed it the same day.  Sans, running to Best Buy for a sata cable.

"I am thrilled with my purchase of this CyberPower Gaming PC! The shipping went well and the box was in pristine shape. Upon opening the box and removing the computer and accessories everything was nicely packaged and clean. I noticed the RTX 2070 Super video card was a Gigabyte brand with the three fans, which is fantastic! I did not expect the 16gb memory to be encased in a nice white shell which really looks great with the rest of the interior of the PC. I was able to hook the PC and begin updating Windows and drivers immediately. The only issue I ran into, which is probably partly my fault for not noticing while I had the case open originally, was that the USB ports were not working at first. I finally noticed that the cable for the top of the case USB ports had come unplugged. Simple fix.To be able to purchase this amazing gaming PC at this price is a steal and I would recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade. I will continue to purchase from Amazon and CyberPower PC going forward.",5,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0

"Honestly, this thing has exceeded my expectations on what it could do. Modern Warfare at 180fps, ultra settings. Division 2 at 110fps at ultra. That is much more than i could have hoped for. Easy set-up out of the box. The only confusing part was the RGB adapter for the lights but anyone with even a little PC knowledge will get it. It's fast, quite, and most importantly it doesn't over heat! Do your research though, read about the motherboard and the options ASUS provides with the BIOS system. I have my set-up in an open well ventilated space, if you don't, adding extra fans is a cinch and the mother board as a few extra headers for them. I'll update my review as time goes on. For now though, extremely satisfied!",5,1,2020-8-21,1,1,0

"This is a review after using the build for some time. So after a few months, I had started getting BSODs which I had later linked to memory related errors and ran some tests after being prompted to by support to test each memory modual to see which moduals are bad. Now after running these tests both memory sticks were shown to be defective. I had then sent in an eRMA to CyberpowerPC within the time I had received and even opened the product between what I expected the warrenty period to be. This PC was recieved on my doorstep on Sept. 10 2019 and was not opened till a few days later then was also registered in November of 2019 which prompted I now had a 1 year warranty. Later, support tells me that warrenty period begins on the day of purchase... even before I can physically see the product and open it. Now ok, fine, its their misleading warrenty, now, the memory moduals themselves have a lifetime warranty on it and apparently that could not be honored due to them saying they are two different companies and basically it's not their problem. Well, Cyberpower, it is your problem, you have used these parts, you have bought these parts and used them in builds which are defective and they are now standing in your way of a good overall review of your product and customer service from me.

First I realized there was no remote to actually use the RGB in the box(Minor Issue for me personally but still).Then the real problems started and sadly I had to do a whole boat load of fixing as soon as I got it hooked up. To start I got about 10 Whea blue screen errors while trying to do anything. Unhooked everything and made sure all hardware was seated properly and fired back up, same thing unfortunately. Ended up having to do a BIOS reset and finally was not getting crashes but as soon as I tried to update Windows it refused to do so. Had to do a complete re install of Windows 10, reinstall all drivers, and manually update windows and .net framework to be able to play anything on Steam.",1,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
"I like the comp a whole lot better when I realized you need HDMI 2.0 to get 4k 60fps! Anyway the thing started right up and I was gaming within 20 minutes (WoW lets you play while it downloads). My last comp was i3-3220, imagine the difference! I was concerned when i went to benchmark sights and found the cpu near the bottom in the rankings. Some of the reasons listed for bad performance were the usual you would expect: Overheating, voltage throttling, etc. One of the reasons is: You are using an overclockable chip and you are not overclocking. So I did a little research and downloaded the Intel Overclocking Utility set it for 4.8 GHz and the score was much improved. I used Userbenchmark.com. I'm using Hisense 43r6e HDR 4k as my monitor and once I got the HDMI 2.0 the HDR symbol showed on the screen. You have to enable/disable in Display and non HDR material  including your desktop will look bad. However, any HDR material including games will look amazing. Keep in mind the nits on my TV is only 296 (SDR=100) on a high-end >1000 nit screen it would be truly astounding.  Call of Duty: Warzones has ray-tracing and also look great. Kept up over 60fps with some dialing back of the settings. World of Warcraft : Battle for Azeroth played ultra settings  ~70 - 120 fps in game.  Overclocking did very little (around 1.5 fps maybe) but increased my CPU temp from normal 56 C to almost 80 degrees C. I also noticed that while idle the cpu will Turboboost  to 4.8MHz but when streaming Youtube or gaming the CPU never went over 3.6GHz unless manually set with the Overclocking Utility. Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase especially now that I am stuck at home and I have to somehow occupy myself. Heh.Update 4/21/2020: Using MSI afterburner for benchmarks I noticed the RTX runs hot when gaming. I adjusted the fan speed curve to bring up the fan at a lower temp (75C). I then had the idea that I should check temps at 1080p and they were 15C cooler, just an FYI. Overall still very satisfied with my purchase.",5,1,2020-3-24,1,0,0

"This system is great. It arrived ready to go, fired right up without any issue. I am able to run every game I wanted to play on high to ultra settings with 60FPS in 1080p, 1440p on some titles. The packaging was secure, instructions quite clear. My only minor tiny complaint is the RGB not being software controlled, at least as far as I can tell. It would be nice to not have to rely on a tiny remote that I will likely lose in a year's time. For $1399 this is a great gaming system that will be enjoyed for years to come.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Bought this PC about a month ago, and my initial impression was that it was a great bang for the buck. It was delivered quickly and in great shape, setup was extremely easy, and upon powering it up, it ran all games and applications quick and smoothly. The only reason I dropped it a star was because after about 3 weeks, the PSU became faulty and started causing unexpected shutdowns. I had to RMA the entire unit, but Cyberpowerpc was very helpful once I explained the problem, and had my computer repaired and back to me in about 4 days (I live close to one of their facilities so I didn't have to ship it).",4,1,2019-9-28,1,1,0

Amazon took 2 weeks to get another one out to him (Prime, 2 day delivery?!?What a joke!)! Received on Wednesday, up & humming on Thursday, fried by Sunday. While playing a game computer crashed & turned off. Now just cycles on & off by itself without bothering to image from graphic card or mb. What a joke!",1,1,2020-1-12,1,1,0
"Out of the box the Pc isn’t the best I would recommend getting some more fans to improve airflow through the case. I would also say that out of the box you can’t overclock the i9 9900k to over 4.7 GHz but even that is a stretch the case itself is just bad for airflow as the two side mounted fans are either blowing out tiny slots or in taking from tiny slits. One of the fans that came included was from cooler master and broke in the first few months. When I bought this it was at 1499. Which is a good deal if you price the parts out but for much more than that it is better to build it yourself. Also, cyber power offers gift cards for reviewing their stuff so take most of these reviews with a grain of salt. Overall I would say that this is a good build for the price but for the price there should be a bit more expected from the case.",4,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0

Haven't done simultaneous streaming yet or any video editing but I expect it will run well.  Overall, very happy so far.  Will update of that changes!Side note:  I priced out building this PC on my own and it came out to be a couple hundred more dollars.  So as long as they built it with high standards you can't lose.

"works great , good selection of parts in my setup only complaint is air flow. fans are not adjustable on the case and cannot be adjusted because they are not ran through the motherboard. thats my only complaint. runs smooth on ultra high settings for the games i have played so far. havent tried to do any overclocking. will probably replace the fans in the case or try to reconfigure the way they are wired to have more airflow before trying any overclocking. cable management was actually very good.",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"This beast of a gaming computer is used for school work, gaming (obviously), and miscellaneous tasks. Overall, the computer is extremely fast and can handle virtually every game thrown at it on Ultra Settings, 60+ FPS. Multi-tasking is seamless and the experience is very pleasant when using this computer.Because I have had this computer for many months, some issues have become apparent to me. The liquid cooling is not as effective as it should be, and the PC constantly exhausts heat. In a small room, the PC can increase the temperature quite a bit when playing a graphically demanding game, such as Red Dead Redemption 2 or Battlefield 1. My primary goal was to get this build as a primary setup, and do minor changes to the configuration, adding more ram sticks, etc. Without additional processing power, this computer is not strong enough to stream graphically intensive games. Rocket League, CSGO, and older titles should have absolutely no complications with the switch interface. However, I have seen noticeable drops in FPS and lag when trying to stream more demanding titles. I would recommend potentially adding a few more RAM sticks and/or keeping the PC in the strongest condition possible. The cooling/heat exhaust system and streaming complications are really the only problems I have with this PC. It is an absolute beast at 1440p, and 4k also runs very well for me. The RTX 2070 Super is a fantastic card, and I do not regret one single dollar I spent on this device.; strongly recommended!",4,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0

"Be prepared to update drivers and all sorts of things when you get your PC. Mine kept getting blue screens. I started Destiny 2 and it immediately shut down with a blue screen and restarted. I updated drivers and same thing. I called tech support and that's the only positive I have to say about everything is how quickly they answered the phone. I got to speak to a real person too. Each time was a very quick conversation and they would send me an email with something to try. I tested my Rams, reinstalled Windows, etc. I got tired of trying to fix my brand new computer after 13 hours. I called tech back and told them I wanted to send it back to them, for them make sure it works properly this time and THEN send me a computer that works. I spent way too much money to not get a working computer. I'm NOT an IT person. 😑 I should get back in 7-14 days. Last convo I had with them they think the SSD is bad. 🤷",1,1,2020-3-29,1,0,0

The system is extremely quiet, and doesn't seem to have any problems with heat so far.

I know a thing or two about computers, so after doing some troubleshooting, I figured out either the hard drive was toast, or the motherboard had an issue. It couldn't read a hard drive on the device. So I call amazon support to start a claim. After they determine its not a ""basic"" issue, they call Cyberpower's IT line. I was on hold for about 45 min. The IT lady from amazon got tired of waiting, so instead of giving up, she transferred me over, so I could wait on hold. I stayed on the line for another hour and a half (I had my phone on speaker while I was reading a book) and I never got to talk to a technician. Ill try again today, but looks like im getting screwed. Really expensive paperweight at this point. I honestly wouldnt be too upset, but the support for this is non existent at this point.

"Have only had this for a few days and still running some tests on it, but it is quite good for the price, performs well in all the games I have thrown at it so far, although the system is def. thermally constrained (CPU), temps can reach 90C on Prime 95 and, for example in BFV around 80C (CPU, GPU is fine, stock clocks). The only issue I have is with the liquid cooler (which makes, or I believe one of the fans on it, makes rattling/clicking noises on high load). The parts that it comes with are also fairly good, for the most part (especially if you do not plan on overclocking).

Had to format the backup drive once we got it running, but no big deal.  I will also note that you will need to make some vsynk settings to ""off"" in the nvidia control panel to get above 60fps in steam games....just try some google to see how.

"Grate for the first PC for I ever own! I had for a few months now and hadn't had any significant problems. The only downsides I had was some chipping on the corners of the tower's cover, probably from how it was handled in transit, the power cord for it wasn't working well at all, and the Internet had issues. It comes with a little antenna to attach to the pc that is awful with connecting the Internet wirelessly, so I had to wire my pc to the router itself for a better online gaming experience. I had to buy another power cord for the pc to use and toss the one it came with to the trash, which is an inconvenience for me when you spend so much money on a PC and don't expect to pay more to fix issues that it has.Regardless all was as advertised, runs smoothly, has a quiet hum when running.

"Imagine my excitement when this brand new beast of a machine showed up at my door. Hooked everything up and pressed the power button and.. nothing. That's the instant I knew I made a mistake buying a PC on Amazon built by a third party. In the past, I've purchased directly from CyberpowerPC and never had a single bad thing to say but these guys are allowing a third party to make them look bad. Yes, it's about $400 cheaper than buying directly from CyberpowerPC but playing the brand lottery is not worth the potential headaches and the possibility of having to return and wait for a refund or replacement. I took it apart many times and finally it powered on randomly. Worked great for 12 days but then randomly wouldn't power on again. Came to the conclusion it must be faulty power supply or faulty power button. I've had the PC less than 2 weeks!

I don't have any serious concerns at this point. there are a couple of things that should be pointed out. The machine arrived with subpar documentation. In fact, a dvd allegedly provided drivers and a manual for a completely different version of the MOBO even though the machine itself has no dvd drive. The MOBO is an ASROCK Phantom Gaming 4-CB which is custom made for Cyberpower and may have issues for updating the BIOS.

The aesthetics of this PC are excellent with great cable management (although I may replace the ketchup and mustard cables with custom power supply sleeved cable extensions).  The RGB on this is very pretty to look at and the included remote works as expected.  I may purchase a magnetic RGB strip for some extra lighting.

"After one week of owning the computer, the processor would reach almost 100 degrees celsius on intense gaming before completely switching off my GPU drivers and the fans speeding up like crazy. I took it to a computer repair store here and they first thought it was the liquid cooling but nope, after changing it was still reaching high temperatures. They changed the processor but nope even the new processor they added to the system was rising to really high temperatures. They then added the original i7-9700k processor to a new motherboard during benchmark and it was a stable 72 degrees. Shipping this PC back to the US would’ve been more expensive than getting it fixed here. I knew this PC was too good to be true for its price point.

I bought this product for myself in preparation for some of the newer game titles coming out soon. My previous gaming computer was build using hand-me-down parts over the years and wanted a fresh PC for a fresh start. I am so glad I did. I have never worked with liquid cooling before so I was curious on how it would sound while in use and I am able to play games at Ultra settings for hours and it still sounds as if it was in idle.

Holy hell! The beautiful graphics I have been missing out on have never been more apparent. There was no bloat-ware on this PC. I got it and I clonezilla-ed it immediately. I had to use external USB sticks and HDs since there are no internal/external drive bays available on this particular PC case. Still, I loaded up my favorite games, and cranked up the settings to the MAX. WOWZA! It performs flawlessly! Quiet too. Coupled with the AOC CQ32G1 curved 1440p monitor, I am in heaven.

"My system came in in good condition and worked out of the box.  The cabling was neat but not exactly accurate.  The fans was all connected to one source that prevents you from controlling them individually.  Eventually I will buy more fans and fix that.  All of the games I play runs great.  Examples: Forza Horizon 4 runs on Ultra above 4k and average a solid 70 to 80 fps.  Destiny 2 4k most settings Ultra a solid 60fps.  Division 2 Ultra at an 85% resolution scale hits 50 to 60, I don't notice any drops because I have an LG B9 that does G-sync and VRR.  The only game that I have that really struggles is Anthem that requires me to drop the resolution to around 1600p to get a solid 60.The main problem is the parts that you can't select.  My system came with a Zotec RTX 2070 Super mini which has fans that is always running so even 7 feet away and just browsing the web I can still hear it.  Other brands of RTX 2070's like EVGA or MSI can have a lower fan curve to lower the sound of the card.  The motherboard is a  Asrock Z390 Phantom Gaming 4-CB.  Which is a decent board that supports SLI and 2 NVME drives but bios updates and the like is not supported by Asrock as the CB part of the name means it is a Cyber Power custom board.  All in all a good system for those that don't want to build there own or don,t know how to.  Just be aware that people will have different experiences because of the random selection of parts.",4,1,2020-3-6,1,0,1
"The machine had everything I wanted. Unfortunately, I waited 2 weeks for a machine that wouldn't even POST. The box had power- all of the fans spooled up -- except for the RTX 2070's. It showed no signs of life, and no video signal was coming off of it from DP or HDMI. I even took out the card and re-seated it. Nada.  Also, the ""lighted"" RGB case fans didn't ever light.

"Let me tell you something - this PC is a beast. I got it today, and it’s running every game 4k around 80fps; no problem. Not only does it perform, but it gives looks. This has to be one of the best looking pre-builds i’ve seen on the market. I can’t wait to spend the next couple of years with this PC. I got this on sale ($1199), which made it even better. However, don’t let the retail price break you. The components which come with the PC itself easily break the price point. In my case, a Z390-P motherboard and a 2070 Super. One thing, though. When I first received the PC, I was disappointed by the internet speed, but later found out through customer support that you have to screw 2 antennas coming in a goodie-bag inside the box. This alleviated the awful internet speed, and started running as I previously mentioned. All in all, I am very content with my purchase, and I know you will to.

Couldnt even get to testing the machine in terms of gaming at all.The whole reason I bought a prebuilt pc was so I didnt have to mess around and figure out why it isnt working.",1,1,2020-5-29,1,1,0
I don't normally like to write reviews. I purchased this computer for both work and gaming. I is a beautiful looking machine and runs very smoothly. I did notice my computer was running a bit hot and so gave it a bit closer look. One of the fans connected to the liquid cooling system was not spinning. I called customer service after registering my machine and decided to take the call back function. Hours later no callback. Monday morning I call back in again and this time wait for help. The Team member who is assisting me was not very helpful and I can understand a little frustration as I have little Idea of what I am looking for. Turns out the power supply was disconnecting somewhere. Jiggling of the wires got the fan to start running but unfortunately it was still intermittent and I am talking to the team member throughout my fumbling's he just goes OK and hangs up. I recommend the machine and for the price it is great but god forbid anything goes wrong with it because calling them is a nightmare in frustration.,3,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"I was initially worried reading that the parts received would be a ""mixed bag"" so to speak of what would be in the build but am pretty pleased with what I got. Build came with an asus z390-P motherboard, asus 2070 super which i was very happy with and also came with 2 8gb patriot ram sticks which are tbh meh but they work. The only reason im giving this review 4 stars overall is because1) The ram/speed is honestly pretty bleh",4,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
"Computer arrived on time and was well packaged. Computer is fast and quite. This thing runs really cool compared to my old one that I built. CPU is running 29C at idle and around 38C while playing Warcraft. GPU is running 39C idle and I don't think the fans on the GPU have even kicked in while gaming. The case fans are really nice looking and super quiet. I like the way the case looks, very nice. The pictures on the listing don't do it justice. It looks a lot better up close in person. The remote for the led lights is a nice addition to this setup. The case is nice and big with plenty of airflow. The only downside I see with the case right now is there is no hard drive bay to add drives. This thing is a huge upgrade from what I had and so far I am well pleased with it.",5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"YOU GUYS!! Okay, so this was an impulse buy. BUT THIS THING IS A MONSTER! I waited... and waited.. because I wanted to decide if I should or not HOWEVER!!, I AM SO GLAD I DID! It arrived beautifully packaged, setup is easy, starts up in SECONDS you hear me??! Upon unboxing, you get instructions on your motherboard, remote, cd setup, etc. Removing the tempered glass door, i had to take out the bubble wrap and that was it! Cables are secured very nice and neat, and its pretty much on from there! The colors are awesome, in my case you don't even hear it on! It's so quiet! I've been wanting one of these for months now, and im glad I decided to jump on board! Honestly its sleek, the specs are nice for starting out, but if you're like me and you're just jumping into the gaming world, then do NOT HESITATE! 5 stars all away around! (Yes, im keeping the plastic on) :)",5,1,2020-5-8,1,1,1
Was looking for a fast and quiet PC. This fit the bill exactly as advertised. Straight out of the box and ready to go. Reinstalled MS Office and my games and was well on my way in under 15 minutes. Very powerful and fast PC. Amazon got it to me in 1 day. Very happy with this purchase. I usually build PC's myself but with prices these days it is no longer a huge saving like it used to be. This is a very nice PC put together for gaming and well beyond any home office needs. The only item it does not have is a DVD or CD drive but you can purchase an external one fairly cheap if needed. I hardly ever have a need for one anymore as I usually back up to a network drive or jump drive.Nice job CyberPower!,5,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0
"After waiting all day at work with the notification that it was going to be delivered much earlier than expected (which was great), I get home to open a damaged $1,850 computer. The corner is smashed in (see photo), the bottom thumb screw is broken and bent sideways and the glass pane likewise is chipped and the mount bar bent up. Not to mention the cable management is atrocious. This is ridiculously disappointing. It also didnt have the antenna for the wifi. Three of the buttons on the included keyboard were dislodged apparently from an impact of some sort to the outside of the packaging. With all that being said, it still works so far. Waiting for a game to download to see if there are any issues.",1,1,2020-6-25,1,1,1
"I am impressed with quality of the product for the price.  All the computers in my home are from Cyberpower and some of them are as old as 9 years.  They still work good and have never had any issues with tech support, they have always been a help even after warranty expired.  This has everything my old systems did not.  LED lighting that you can customize, liquid cooled, SSD, and exceptional Video card.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,2,0
"After contemplating building a pc for a long time I finally splurged and bought this as it was cheaper to buy this prebuild than to build it myself. I must say I’m very impressed and only wish I would’ve made the transition sooner. I honestly can’t believe I waited so long, the difference between pc and console is night and day, and it’s honestly an unfair advantage I have now. I’m running 240 fps on epic settings in fortnite and absolutely dominating the game now. So glad I decided to make the leap!",5,1,2020-3-21,1,1,0
Not a computer guy at all so I’m probably a terrible judge but I will say for anyone that knows nothing about PCs this is a pretty sweet set up.  Very easy to set up and ran fine out of the box I did install some software and update drivers for gpu and motherboard. Playing call of duty on a 4K monitor this things does get a little warmer than I’d like. All of the fans on my unit were set to exhaust so I switched the front two around to draw in cooler air and bought some magnetic dust filters running much cooler now and overall I’m blown away at how much better games like destiny two and elder scrolls look on this thing,5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"This PC runs very smoothly and is a great value for the price! I had been looking to buy a PC for awhile when I came across this one. I absolutely love the RGB and that it is controllable by the remote.  It is very clean and the cable management is great. It was also nice that it came with a keyboard and mouse. Photoshop runs very smoothly and quickly. Gaming is great on this PC as well. All my games run smoothly with no problems. The only problem I had was with shipping. I was sent a product with a broken case, but I contacted Amazon and they sent me a new one and even picked up the broken one. Cyberpower also had great customer service. I highly recommend it.",5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"So I was trying to upgrade my first gaming Pc which had a 7th generation I5 and a radeon rx 580 graphics card. Long story short, I would have been buying all the separate parts of a new pc so I decided to just go with another Pre-built. 3 months in and I still completely love it. The fans aren't too loud, and I can run almost anything with maxed out settings and maintain 60+Fps. If you want customizable RGB lights for the fans, there's that too. When I got this Pc, it was around $1500 after taxes, and I honestly can't complain. With the RTX 2070 super and the i7-9700K alone make it worth the price. Finally, I haven't had any problems with overheating. I don't know much about liquid cooling, but even when playing cpu intensive games, I haven't gone above 75C. Overall, 10/10 would recommend.",5,1,2020-7-9,1,1,0
Overall a good purchase but be prepared to replace the PSU.I had the computer less than month give or take and the power supply already failed.,3,1,2020-5-18,1,2,0
"Dislikes: Graphics card didn't work, had to remove and re-seat in order to get it operational. 2 USB 3.0 ports on the top of the PC didn't work. Looked inside and the pins were bent where the assembler just jammed the cord on there. In the process it bent multiple pins. Considering this cost almost $1400.. It's quite a disappointment that it arrives in damaged condition that is NOT from shipping. There is also the issue that the mic jack and the headphones jack on the system do not work (they are on the top next to the power button). You'd be better off buying from someone other than CYBERPOWERPC if you want a fully operational system.It is quiet, does run fairly well otherwise.",1,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"This will be my gaming rig, just received it yesterday. Shipped really quickly and arrived in perfect condition.  Started right up & ran beautifully right out of the box. My first impression is just how quite this thing is. I love the build and the way it looks. I had a GTX 1080  from my old pc that died (CPU failure), and I had some extra hard drives from it as well so I'm now running it with the GTX 1080, another 1TB HD, and a 500GB SSD added to it. Everything plugged in and it's off to the races. I have not tried it for real gaming yet but I'll update it once I get everything installed and run some sessions on it but I think it's going to perform wonderfully.",5,1,2019-7-12,1,2,1
"Bought this as a new gaming PC for myself. It has no problem with Cities Skylines and Dirt Rally on ultra settings at 1440p. It did include a small extra RGB controller board in a box, that I do not remember being advertised, which included no instructions on how to install it, nor what it was for. I'm concluding that it would be used to add your own LED light strips, in addition to the RGB fans built-in, that respond to the included remote. The keyboard they include is usable, although very squishy and does not always respond to key presses accurately, and I would recommend you get even a $20 standalone keyboard over this. My mouse also arrived with a damaged DPI switch, and I have not tried using it. I would not expect the peripherals to be your daily drivers, more like some backup accessories. That being said, I bought this for the nice prebuilt PC with genuine Windows 10, not the cheap bundled input devices, so I'm still going to go with 5 stars, because it's great in that respect :)",5,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
I was looking to build a video editing PC (DaVinci Resolve) when I found this one with pretty similar specs and two bonuses.....already built and a better price.  I've been running DVR 16 on it for a couple weeks now and I'm very pleased with the performance.  Render times even better than I anticipate.  A very good purchase so far.,5,1,2020-1-16,1,2,0
"The box came all bang-up, understandably is not their fault. The inside was well packed, my issue is that the keyboard comes with a missing key and the letter M on the keyboard, I have to push really hard to get it to work. Cyberpower sending me a used keyboard. I was going to sen it back, but since I am not going to use it( Clunky keyboard ), I just dump it in the trash. you would think for fifteen hundred bones I would get a decent keyboard. Oh, I forgot,  there are two screws flopping in the bottom of the computer, I have to take the computer apart where the voltage box is, so I decided to leave the screw/nuts where there are.

"I'm rewriting my entire review, now that I have a better understanding of PC's/Computers.Fair warning to first timers; Don't worry about the ""Addressable RGB chip."" You don't need it, the PC already has ARGB with the remote it comes with. With that, my thoughts; Performance is solid! Runs GTA V smoothly and I've tested Minecraft with RTX on. (gorgeous, btw.) Unfortunately, those are the only 2 games I bought atm for examples. I also tested Autodesk Maya, Mudbox, Blender, Krita, it handles Animation software both 2D and 3D with flying colors. Now onto my gripes.",4,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"This machine came on time and was packaged very well.  After reading other reviews I got two extra fans to help cooling, but I think they weren’t necessary, I’ve checked my temps for several weeks now and there isn’t an issue.  To be fair I’m not stressing the machine as hard as some would, but if there were a cooling issue, the base temps would be higher than I’m seeing.Very fast, very quiet.  Cable management is good.  And the price was excellent for what you get with this system.  Im a bit older and don’t care for all the led colors, but the included remote let me set them all to a steady pleasing color.  Definitely would recommend",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"I am heavily involved in the flight simulation community.  Six years ago I acquired a PC that, at that time, was very capable of providing the frames and graphics for the programs that I was using.  But with most computer programs, the graphics exploded from megabythes to gigabythes.  I was looking for a gaming computer with the all of the interface components that would bring me up to date.  After months of research, I basically trusted my faith that I had in Amazon's quality products.After 2 months, this computer has been everything that I had hoped it would be.  I am very satisfied with this PC and would most likely purchase from this company again.",4,1,2020-3-27,1,1,0
"I bought this as a replacement/upgrade and was not disappointed. Boots up fast, video card is great, and the fans are very quiet. I read other people's issues and had bought a spare wireless adapter and extra fans, anticipating issues. So far I have been fortunate in that there was no major problems. I did have an initial scare when inspecting to make sure everything was plugged in; I had no idea that the SSD was this tiny stick flush against the motherboard and panicked when I thought they 'forgot' to include it. Of course, it booted windows fine indicating the SSD was in fact present.While I was able to install a fan in the bottom of the case to 'suck' in cold air, the liquid cooling system's fan doesn't leave room to add an exhaust fan in the top grate. The tempered glass itself can get rather warm from extended use, ventilation seems poor. You may want to just make do with a bit more noise for the sake of cooling by turning up fan speed in the BIOS. I had no problem with the wifi but dont forget to actually screw in the little antenna it comes with because that made a huge difference in reception. Overall a good computer that you might want to baby a bit just to get good life out of the mobo and GPU.",4,1,2019-9-30,1,1,0
Amazon could not reach Cyberpower PC to get a new keyboard Amazon rep said there was no answer to the helpline.  I think they are sending a new system to replace the keyboard.  Just wanted the keyboard replaced. If Amazon can't reach them what hope do I have if the system fails in warranty.  Will update this review as things progress.

Bought this Black Friday for a crazy deal. Wasn’t into the aesthetics of the pc but the components were spot on for the price so I changed some things up look-wise. Thing is a beast. Real sweet spot especially for Black Friday sale price. I did have a fan clicking noise that luckily a review on here showed me how to fix. Took 5 seconds to loosen a couple screws. Also the two intake fans were set to exhaust so had to fix that as well. Only reason for 4 star. Everything else was great and the pc has exceeded my expectations in performance.,4,1,2020-1-5,1,0,1
Prime 390p motherboard with a lot of program and driver issues out of the box. Don’t plan on getting support from ASUS on anything in this system and the nvidia program will not run so have to close that error every time you start the program up.

Before it even gets to the part where the windows logo shows up there is an Asus Logo that shows where it gives you the opportunity to enter bios. It will freeze on that spot Some times If I wait like 10min it will let me it other times it's stuck 100% Ill have to restart the computer multiple times occasionally it will let me in but most of the time I just unplug the computer let it sit for like an hr and try again and it will let me.

I have not had any issues at all with its performance with even the highest AAA games in VR. I did add a second SSD to mine as I wanted more drive space, it was an easy upgrade that took me maybe 30 minuets from unplugging the PC to firing it back up. This PC run very quiet and boots up in seconds. The only thing that bugs me just a little is every now and then the RGB CPU fan stops working and revers to just white.

Processor in pc was not as advertisted it came with a 9700f and not a 9700k which i should have received.

Although the games I utilize it for are not many multiplayer games, when faced with complicated renderings and response times to my controls, it is very fast. As I am sure anyone knows, a terabyte is a LOT of space. This tower can handle anything I ask of it and is practically silent most of the time. The color-changing controls are entertaining, just kind of a bonus for me personally.

I tested the cpu on apex legends and was glad to have great performance with high fps. The game was functioning at an amazing performance at max settings. Truly an amazing cpu.

Speed, performance and price!",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"I open the box and see this crap. The styrofoam padding burst inside the computer and absolutely destroyed the thing. I paid $1,400 for this computer and I couldn't even turn it on. This is the kind of quality you pack your $1,400 computers with? And, on top of that, there's wires in front of the padding.  So I couldn't pull it out without risking damage to the wires. I'm never buying from this brand again.EDIT: I also didn’t get a remote for the RGB fans either. Wow.",1,1,2020-9-12,1,0,1
"When I get the computer, I felt so excited. But I found out that you need to put the pc right next to the router to get a wifi signal. I contacted the tech support and they are not very helpful. They were really TRYING to help me out but their way didn't fix the problem. After 2 houring of struggle I found out that you have to attach a very cheap plastic antenna which I thought is a extra part. Great computer, solid built. It's worth the money!",4,1,2020-2-11,1,1,0
I built my last gaming pc back in 2010. Since then after retiring and trying to save on funds I purchased an HP with an i7 in 2016. I put in a better power supply but for the video card the case was too small so I mounted it outside on the side panel. It worked ok but it wasn't great. Now my wife needed a new computer and since my birthday was coming up I suggested She get my pc and I get a new one for my birthday. I couldn't be happier with this one. Since I couldn't piece one together to match these components and price it definitely passed all my expectations with equipment and speed.Our dog had to do a double take on the light show! All is well..........,5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"First gaming desktop, and so far it's really been everything that I was looking for. Good mix of price and power, everything I've thrown at it has barely even made it heat up at 144p ultra 1920 x 1080p. Easy setup and good instructions.Lots of room in the case for add-ons and the case in general is very nice. RGB fans with liquid cooling are incredible, overall very satisfied so far.",5,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"I have had the PC for about 5 days. So far everything is good. I know alot of people have questions about the brands. For my rig, it came with EVGA RTX 2070 Super, Ballistix ram, and an ASUS prime z930p motherboard. Will update as time goes on. I priced out each individual part, if I had built this myself, it would have cost $1530.",5,1,2020-4-6,1,1,0
"Initially I had a big doubt before placing my order, because there were lots of ""negative comments"" on the built quality and post-sales support from BBB. But then I have decided to give it a try, and I am so surprised that my overall experience has been very positive so far. At this price, the built quality is well above my expectation. My experience with their tech support (email) have been positive as well. Their reply is timely, conclusive and polite.So why 4 stars instead of 5? Well it was because I had a short conversation with the sale-rep about pricing/product spec BEFORE placing my order, to be honest I think their response could be more polite and friendlier. It took me a while to reconsider buying from CyberPowerPC at that time. But for some reason, I choose to forgive and told myself maybe the guy over the phone was too tired handling too many calls on labor days sales... So I just went ahead and place order and see what happen next.",4,1,2019-9-16,1,0,0
I was very skeptical about a prebuilt system but thurs thing is plug and play. I did have a fan screw randomly in the case but after reading some other reviews before powering up I checked to make sure everything was tight. Mostly was. Runs WoW at well over 100fps at max settings in populated cities. And above 200fps in raids,5,1,2020-3-22,1,0,1
"I liked that out of box, everything was ready to go. There are a few things I'd have preferred be a bit more clear, but overall the device works for what I need it for. No issues so far, but I'll report back in awhile after I test it a bit. Would definitely recommend thus far.",5,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
"Spent months configuring multiple machines on ibuypower and cyberpowers web site to come up with the ultimate machine.  Also read all the reviews posted by pcgamer, techradar and tomsguide... all reputable resources.  I did my homework but ultimately selected this prebuilt after using the Userbechmark website.  This machine scored extremely high even though its not the newest processor, motherboard, or video card.  I ran the benchmark once I received the machine and verified I bought a UFO.  I haven't overclocked and am running it as delivered for now.  Very happy with the buy.  I only gave it a 4 because of the limited number of USB ports ( I have multiple external drives for storage) and the need for an external Blu-ray/DVD.  Great machine for a great value.",4,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"Works as advertised,  fastest boot time I ever seen.  tech is a little slow to get on phone  waited 20 mins.  computer came with a card for led lights and directions were not very clear.  turns out I didn't even need it,  it's just if you want to add more lights.  so far so good.  very pleased.

This is a decent PC for the price when you look at the specs.  Mine came with decent hardware:ASUS Prime Z390,2,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"The PC arrived as my first gaming pc. I have been researching for months and found the specs on this to be more than enough to game anything I want to. The only thing  I ask is that you CHANGE OUT THE RAM. I got ram that i'd never heard of, ran poorly and honestly bottlenecked the system. With a $100 purchase ( found on sale ) I upgraded the RAM CONSIDERABLY and turned this into a monster. The GPU arrived as the single fan version so I have to watch the temps but besides that It was a very good purchase",4,1,2020-6-5,1,1,0
"Clean wire management, runs smooth, fast setup. Couldn't be more pleased. Beast of a computer at half the price of a custom build with same prices. Prime said it would take 4 days to deliver but it still ended up being here within 2. Used for about a week now and am a big fan. Solid mouse and keyboard (i still replaced the mouse for another Chroma style mouse with the keypad on the side for extra pewpews, but it's a solid mouse in case mine fails). Overall 10/10.  Marked 4/5 for noise because it does run a tiny bit loud-- just the fans really. Has lots of them.  Not at all offputting or annoying...... Puts of an absolute ton of heat is probably my only gripe, but any decent gaming pc does from my experience.",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"I bought this PC as my first PC for strictly gaming. It runs excellent right out of the box. The box came heavily damaged, but the PC inside was in flawless condition. I have no trouble at all running games at max settings with only 50% CPU usage. The PC is also surprisingly quiet packing 4 fans. It also has a sealed liquid cooling system that requires no maintenance (great for anyone’s first PC). The mouse that comes with the computer is decent (keyboard, not so much), but I’d definitely recommend investing in new ones, especially for gaming. All around the computer is excellent for a casual gaming machine.",5,1,2019-9-22,1,1,0
"This is my second one. Both have different parts in them, the first has a asus MB and a gigabyte 2070 super OC GPU with 2600mhz ram second has a asrock phantom MB a asus 2070 super OC GPU and 3000mhz ram. Both are very quiet and have handlesd anything I threw at them.

"Really good gaming PC. Its able to run all recent games at 1080p above 60 fps. Tried CoD: MW(2019), Doom:E, PUBG and also CoD:MW2-CR runs them without breaking a sweat. Setup is very simple and bloatware is non-existent. One thing that isn't mentioned anywhere is that its standard hard disk is an Intel NVMe m.2 SSD with really good read and write speeds. There is also an additional m.2 slot available for expanded storage. The unit does not come with any display cables so make sure that is taken care of before it arrives. Tends to get a little noise when running ML workloads (barely noticeable). Strongly recommend as a good balanced computer to play most recent and popular games at good frame rates.",5,1,2020-5-14,1,0,1

"(I would give it a 4.5 star, but I can only give it either a 4 or a 5 and I believe giving it a 4 would be doing it injustice, since my WiFi problem was easily fixed.) I do not know much about computers, but I will say this is a reasonably priced one that gives you the best bang for your buck. The only problem I have found so far was that the computer could not connect to my WiFi. I then found out that I had to plug in the white ASUS antenna thing to get the WiFi. Other than that, it was very easy to start using it from the get go.Also, the keyboard and mouse was a nice bonus, as all I had to do next was buy a monitor.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"I was skeptical at first. My dreams of playing at 240 fps had the chance to become reality. So I took the leap, and boy am I glad I did. This pc has ran amazing since day 1. Even after being used for long gaming sessions (12+ hours) the liquid cooling kept all the parts cool and did not have a single issue. Setup was easy and well explained. This thing will run anything I throw at it. Thats what I was looking for. Fortnite, apex, cod, escape from tarkov all run flawlessly on this pc. A must have for any gamer wanting to take it to the next level.",5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0

"I absolutely love this gaming computer. It runs great and is such a great deal for what it is. The system was completely intact and nothing was damaged. I have had no problems with this computer (although it is a little strange that I got an Asus Wifi Go ring in the motherboard bag). While it's going to be great either way one thing to note about this system is the ram manufacturer, power supply manufacturer, and SSD manufacturer (maybe more components except for the CPU and GPU) will vary as time goes on. Another thing to note is that that GPU fans may not automatically be on when you first turn on the pc and you might have to install something like MSI Afterburner or Aorus Engine to make the fans spin.",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0

So far so good on this PC. I bought this on the recommendation of a friend who does streaming and used to game professionally and am pleased with it’s performance and the value I got. As I’m not an experienced pc gamer and this being my first pc I’ve purchased in nearly 20 years I can’t speak expertly on it beyond no problems with my gaming so far which includes fortnite. The bad. I wasted multiple hours trying to figure out an optional item (I think) with no actual instructions to use. The second reason I lowered my rating was the mouse they included has no software to map the buttons as a gaming mouse. This leads to multiple buttons not being usable when setting up mouse hotkeys on most games. (Only 1 of them I’d likely want to remap but that’s enough to hinder my use of it. Now the mouse doesn’t sound like a big deal but when I was looking into it and was finding people commenting about it for well over a year it’s been long enough for me to be annoyed at an unresolved fix on my brand new pc.,4,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0

Read dead redemption 2, call of duty, Elder Scrolls Online, GTA and more.  Considering the amount of fans it has, its pretty darn quiet too. I ended up only needing to buy a monitor for my setup as they already include a keyboard and mouse. I absolutely love this machine. As of now I have not needed to speak with tech support. I can only hope they are as good as this pc runs. I'm very happy with my purchase.",5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"Would give this 5 stars but the PC had the wrong i7 processor in it. Was supposed to be the 9700k but had the 9700f. I'm not going to send it back just because of that, because in the long run there is very little difference between the 2 processors benchmark wise, but when someone pays over 1K for a product it should have the right components installed. I just received today so will update if I overlooked anything else missing or wrong.",4,1,2020-1-8,1,0,1

I have no complaints in terms of hardware, construction, heat levels, or contents (mouse, keyboard, etc.).The only three things that I need to mention is that the chassis is a little bigger than one might expect, the computer isn't loud, but also not as quiet as I would prefer, the LEDs can only be turned on/off or manipulated by a remote instead of on the chassis itself, (and a bit concerning) the box arrived beat up and opened.",5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0

The packaging wasn't all that great either. Out of the box the gpu runs too hot for me at 84 degrees, mostly due to the msi aero (blower card). I had to make a few adjustments getting the temperature down to just 69 degrees while doing some heavy gaming. The computer is fast and plays games amazing (after the tweaking of course).

For gaming it runs almost every game I have at 1080p max settings 144fps. Other than that, the mouse that is included is pretty good I would just suggest to get a new keyboard. I did order this on December 1st and got it on the 20th but that's because I ordered when it was out of stock.

Overall I'm happy with my purchase and love the lighting effects,5,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
"Very impressed, could barley hear the computer on. I downloaded all sims 4 and all the expansions and it works like a champ! Was weekend when I received it the box was pretty banged up but the computer was very well packaged snugged and safe!",5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"Runs games extremely well, only complaint is that it occasionally crashes whatever game I’m playing and I have to restart from there, because any attempts to restart the game are met with more crashes.  Still, this is little more than a minor inconvenience, as it reboots relatively quickly and is usually good for several hours after that.Overall, fantastic gaming PC.",4,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
Absolutely love this thing. Relatively new to gaming but I use this beast for other business purposes so the gaming aspect is a big plus. Pretty much plug and play and super fast compared to my old gaming laptop. Going to probably use this to build my own in the future with replacing parts and whatnot but this is definitely a good starting PC for me to start with I would recommend.,5,1,2019-11-16,1,1,0
"I know a lot about code but not a lot about specs. But so far I’ve been very happy with this pc, my games looks great and it sets up super easy. My only complaint (which is little and dumb) is the tempered glass sticker is on the actual glass and not the sheet the protects the glass from smudges when it comes out of the box. So I ended up getting smudges on it trying to get the sticker off though it was an easy clean. This PC is quiet and works great, not too mention the lights are cool too! The included keyboard and mouse work great as well.",5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,1

"Awesome computer right out the box. Came with an ASRock motherboard, a Gigabyte RTX 2070 super, an Intel 800w power supply. Lightning fast. Games look amazing, especially when over locked using msi afterburner. Very nice lights too. Would strongly recommend if you want to play games in HD. Also can play most games at 4k if you have a 4k monitor.",5,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0
What I liked most about this product is the price for what is inside of the PC. They don't overcharge you and you get what you pay for. I have already recommended this computer to a couple of my friends who were looking to upgrade. Very satisfied with my purchase and will give a thumbs up to anyone who is thinking of buying this computer.,5,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
Exactly as described! None of my games have even maxed out the system. Its been great for video editing in DaVinci Also.  Wish there was hard drive mounts for later upgrades but might use the extra M.2  that is on my motherboard.,5,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
"I use this as both a work and play computer. The speed is incredible: every game I have tried so far has run at the full 144 FPS supported by my monitor @ 2560x1440 !  This system is everything I hoped for, at a price I could afford.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0

"This PC is pretty, extremely fast, great for gaming, however not sure how the NvidiaRTX2070 started to crash horribly after less than a month of use.  Running only games like overwatch and vermintide 2. Really? It was fun until it became a 30 pound brick. Now it is literally unusable unless I want to browse the web on a worse resolution than my phone and previous PC. Great investment of $1,800 gone. Getting a refund on this PC.",1,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"I expected a pre built computer to be essentially plug and play. Had to update all kinds of drivers. Computer locks up constantly under load (temps are all low so it is not overheating) which requires a hard reset, and after an entire day of trying to narrow down the issue, I want to give up. I do not think I can fix it. I cannot leave a positive review on a product that does not work for me.",1,1,2020-3-2,1,1,0
"Bought 2 of these, one for me and one for the missus. This PC was a really good deal considering the components I received at this price point. Got an ASRock Z390 Phantom 4 motherboard, Patriot DDR4-3000 RAM which is faster than the advertised clock speed, Western Digital Blue SSD, and MSI Zotac 2070 Super.

"Amazing PC. Top of the line and can be used on a professional level. You can run nearly every game on very high FPS. On Fortnite, you can reach FPS up to 400 on competitive settings. On Rainbow Six Siege (highest possible settings) you will get over 200 FPS in game. On Grand Theft Auto 5, you will get amazing performance, fast loading time, fast launch, fast everything along with high FPS. The PC comes with 2 USB 3.0 Ports in the front and a headset jack for wired headsets. On the back, it has multiple USB 2.0 ports, and all the essentials for gaming. No complaints about this PC.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"This is the most cost-effective computer I bought. When the computer arrived, everything was not damaged and it was turned on once. And the performance of the machine is very satisfactory.

What's more, the professional computer assembly also has neat wiring, the RGB lights are perfect, and you can control the lighting with remote control.",5,1,2019-9-12,1,0,1
Was most amazed how quiet the machine was.  Can't hear a thing.  The Video card had come out of it's slot during shipping.It is very poorly mounted.  I had to reinforce it and secure some other wirings.  But so far the thing has been a bear.,5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"Since Black Friday is coming, I was searching for a new gaming computer and I saw this product at amazon. Honestly, I didn't believe what I saw cause it was too good for this price. I even checked the price if I buy the components by myself and the cost is still more expensive than the one that is already built.After for a few weeks of research, I decided to buy this one and here I am writing a review with the new computer. The best computer I have ever owned. If you don't know a lot of computer parts and everything, trust me. You can't get a better deal than this one with this spec.",5,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
Well packaged.  Started right up with no problems.  There was only one minor glitch - one of the two thumbscrews to remove the side glass panel was bent and the plastic part fell off.I did find the foam-in-place insert a bit nerve wracking to remove as it was firmly wedged between the components.  I ended up breaking the foam into bits (inside of the bag) so it could be easily removed without cranking on the innards of the PC.,5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
If I could give it a zero I would I never thought a PC could have such bad heat management. It took me so long to find out why my power crashed thinking it was my room but no it's the fact that they added such cheap fans for this PC I lost so much from those crashes and now that I can't return this I need to buy better fans cause apparently you people are too cheap to add good fans. Do not get this PC unless you have good fans to replace the trash ones they installed don't get trolled like me  or better yet get a PC not from cyberpower PC cause they clearly don't care about us.,1,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
"Product came as stated. It is quiet and quick. Very easy and self-explanatory setup. Great value for its performance. It did come with one of the two plastic keyboard stand pieces missing, but this is not crucial and I am assuming that they will honor this when I call them. No complaints. Machine is very beautiful; customer service was great. Willing to send me a new keyboard when I only asked for the missing plastic part.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,1,0

"The pc works great for gaming and personal use. Had no problems getting loaded into windows, although I did have to get my motherboards latest drivers. My biggest issue was the fact there’s a scratch close to 12 inches in length on top of the case that looks like someone tried to cover it with sharpie marker. Shipping packaging was great so this is something that happened before shipping. Not pleased with that.",2,1,2020-5-18,1,0,1
"Bought this pc cause it was spec to play all the latest games without any problems. Received it pretty quickly. When i first started it, The ARGB Fan at the cooler wouldn't light up but the fan itself work. Took off the other side cover and the plug was undone but no big deal, plugged it in and it work Perfect. Been using this pc over a week now and had 0 issues when playing games or designing artwork. Priced the PC out and with everything in it, it was cheaper to buy this once then to build once identical to it. Defiantly was worth the buy!",5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0

Today I had received the replacement keyboard which is working great.",5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,1
This is a very faster computer and so far have not had any issues.  First thing i did was update all drivers and bios and started installing my games.  going from an i5 37xx to this makes a world of different - from 50+ fps on low to 120 FPS on high in borderlands 3,5,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0

This PC has tons of power and the deal at the time was a cant miss but the heat management is not good at all. The CPU temps were normal but the GPU was around 80-85C.  Just too hot for myself and for longevity. If anyone were too buy this i would say add a couple more fans,3,1,2019-9-26,1,2,0

"Noticed some heating issues the first day and barely played anything intensive. It's been awhile since I've had my own pc but i definitely noticed the front fans were facing the wrong way, blowing air out as ""exhaust"" fans instead. The rear fan was already proper though.

DANGER!!! Glass broke for absolutely no reason when I took the cover off to inspect inside. Broke in my hands spraying me with small shards of glass and cutting my leg. Also had loose disconnected wires for the fans. Make sure everything is securely connected before starting. Also didn’t expect that fans require electrical tape to keep plugs connected.,1,1,2020-2-24,1,0,1
So I’ve had this computer for about a month now and all I can say is that it’s amazing. Computer is very fast and runs every game I have thrown at it at highest settings.

Everything so far is great had it 4 months. The only thing I’m seeming to have trouble with is the crappy custom MOBO.

"Very happy with this purchase so far. Had it for a week, and everything has run smoothly. Getting about 150-200fps with medium settings, can run 4K smoothly at 60fps. This is a beast of a PC, and somehow is still very quiet and doesn’t run hot. The RGB is done very well, and is highly customizable.

"With current price tag, probably not worth buying.  Im giving it this score because at my time of buying this it was actually 1500, and for the specs it had, even with oem parts, was incredibly cheap, and it does function without any major flaws.

Great gaming PC right of the box for a fair price. I've been able to run any game I can download on ultra setting with no problems.

Only downside to this rig is it only had 2 fans and a single fan rad.. NOW it has not even gotten close to high Temps. Even with the cpu overclocked the aio does a good job. Average about 100fps in Sea of theives on max settings at 4k...I will give a better Stat breakdown as I play more games....Metro 142fps average.. Again 4k everything maxed...

I'll keep this review sweet and simple: The PC arrived in very secure packaging with setup instructions. The entire unit is beautiful and I've been using it for almost 4-months before writing this review.

I've been using this computer for about 2 or so weeks now and it's working really well. I have been able to play games consistently at 144 hz, which is what my monitor displays, while using 1080p. It could easily run 1440p at a lower frame rate, but I care more about frames. I recommend adding at least 2 case fans so there is more airflow.

"Never buying a cyber power pc again. Bought one a year ago and had 3 faulty parts break within the first month of owning. Called the customer service and they wouldn’t give me a full refund, only half",1,0,2019-8-30,1,1,0
"After some time with this pc I have changed my mind with how I look at it. First, I don't recommend buying this pc unless you have extra money to purchase more stuff like a better motherboard and more ram that is faster. After about 6 - 8 months with this pc, I have started finding many problems with it like the motherboard just stopped working so I had to spend another $300 on a new motherboard ( You don't have to spend that much but I just wanted something that is a lot better ). Second, for me 16 gigs of ram is not enough so I bought another 16 gigs of ram but I recommend that you purchase new ram that is around 3200mhz because I think 2400mhz is very slow.Pros:",2,0,2020-7-1,1,2,1
Called cyber power pc customer service before and after buying at your amazon store page. Great phone service. bought item and amazon shipped it in 3 days not a scratch on orange box. every thing was well labeled and setup was very easy. THE ONLY BAD THING WAS BOTH STICKS OF RAM WAS LAYING ON BOTTOM OF PC CASE. :( Installed rem and it booted up no problems. In bios cpu fan setting for cpu water pump was set to monitor motherboard not cpu temps. so after 1 hour cpu was running a little hot. No problem i fixed that.side note. Apevia rgb fans on water pump radiator are not pwm fans !!! Will not push proper air flow through radiator. i pulled the rgb case fand off of radiator an relocated them to other case fan locations in pc case. and installed noctua pwm fan. now the cpu is icy cold under load and your colorful rgb case fans are keeping the inside pc case cool under load also. Ok so my mom allays said never give someone a 5 out of five rating because everyone always have room for improvement. BUT YOU GUYS REALLY NAILED IT ON CUSTOMER SERVICE. Thank you.,4,0,2019-12-10,1,0,1
"This is an absolute beast of a PC. Have had no issues doing anything i wanna do it. however the shipping process absolutely ridiculous. Shouldve been to me in 2 days once shipped with prime but instead took almost 2 weeks due amazons decision to ship it via USPS where it sat in Las Vegas for 5 days for whatever reason. other than that it arrived with no damage to the box at all and everything intact. setup was super easy and fast. My unit came with an ASUS RTX 2070 Super EVO OC. No overclocking is necessary with this gpu unless you want it at 2000mhz all the time or want to boost the memory speed as this gpu will boost itself when necessary. Same goes for the CPU, it will boost to 4.9mhz on its own when necessary so unless you want it at 4.9 all the time you dont need to do any overclocking other than to control fan speeds which havent been an issue for me. I will note that in my photo the corsair ram DID NOT come with my unit, that was an upgrade i purchased myself. Saw a review about heat and im not sure the reason why as my PC has yet to get above 40C on the CPU and 70C on the GPU. If you part these parts out separately its about $1500-$1600 so this is a great price. I do recommend changing the power supply. For those wondering the PSU brand is Apevia. Again, extremely happy with the PC just not with the shipping(nobody could tell me where my PC was for almost a week!). Had this pc for a month and have had no issues at all. Definitely a good buy.",5,0,2020-3-11,1,0,1

You have heard others saying their things came with snapped gpu, threaded bolts, no thermal paste, dead parts, you name it. 2 days into my pc and this thing is working fine. Had one of the fan lights unplugged but that took less time to fix than it took to bring my hdd over. Have stress tested the cpu a couple times now, and have benched the gpu on multiple games. Normally I would say build it yourself but this is on sale on you could not build this yourself at this price. I bought straight from Ibuypower, but its there under their same day ready systems.

I can consistently run Rainbow Six Siege and Overwatch at ~144 fps on 1080p with graphical settings maxed, and the system stays silent the whole time. Don't have anything to say on customer support, as I haven't had any problems with anything, so I guess they built it well.

"When I purchase a NEW computer, I expect it to arrive unaltered, with all aspects appearing new. This computer arrived with a very battered ,soiled, previously opened invaded, and poorly resealed outer box. The shipper erroneously routed the box to the wrong city and when it did arrive, the delivery person did not await a signature, but rather, left the box at the front door. Inside the box the accessories packages were invaded and rumpled. The accessories, although not listed, all seem to have been included and undamaged. The computer itself is clean and undamaged, but the side cover had obviously been removed. The graphics card inside is an inferior Zotac brand GTX1660Ti, rather than the Nvidia card and has one HDMI port and three Display Port outputs rather than one HDMI, one DVI-D, and one Display Port, as is stated in the sales description. Because of this I had to buy a Data Port to DVI Port adapter to use my monitor's DVI input.The computer also functions well, although I have not attempted to test any performance limits.",3,1,2019-8-16,0,8,0
"Bought this for my husband for Boxing Day when it was on sale for an even better price, the system works great, boots up instantly from shut down to windows, runs everything great and without any difficulty at all. The only issue we have had from it was after about a week the system wouldn't boot up and apparently a windows 10 update may have caused an error and when we started up the CPU it would only go into the BIOS, apparently Windows 10 was not on the system anymore. We called CyberPowerPC and they walked us through what we should do, we reinstalled Windows 10 and its been about 2 weeks since that happened and so far it hasn't happened again, the tech that we talked to said if it was something faulty inside the unit they would replace it if the problem continued, what better service can you get than that? CyberPowerPC gets a thumbs up from me and with service like that, I will be buying future computers from them again when the time comes, keep up the good work!",5,1,2020-1-18,0,5,0

Arrived in perfect condition. Easy installation. Very fast computer. The wifi is very short distance though. I suggest to get another  wifi adapter for it and make sure to disable the on board WiFi so its wont interfere with the other one you have.

I had forgotten to connect the antenna that come with it. So the wifi also work correctly. my god damn fault,5,1,2019-11-26,0,6,0
"When I first received this PC I gave it a decent review based on my first impressions. After owning it for a little over a month I just had to come back to my previous review now that I’ve gotten to know this machine a little better. When I first received this computer it looked to be of decent quality but you pull the back off and that’s where you really have to ask yourself if buying prebuilt is really any better than hand selecting the components for your own build. When pricing the components in this build out, I could have made it for less if you have the time to look around and shop for the best deal. I know that not everyone can do that but the option is there. The cable management was abysmal with all the cables made into a ball right in front of the power supply and this case is quite hard to move around in so you would really have to unhook everything just to rewire what you already paid someone else to do. When I first turned it on, I had power but nothing wags on the display. Come to find out the GPU was plugged in but not at the power supply which meant having to weed through a pile of cables in a space where I could barely fit my hand in. Once that was fixed it worked no no problem until the CPU started to heat up and the one of the fans sounded like it was grinding up against the radiator. I turned the computer off and contacted CyberpowerPC about the fan issue and they said it would be sent out right away. Unfortunately they are located in California and shipping the fan took over a month. I contacted CyberpowerPC on November 14, 2019 and I just received the fan late last week (December 19, 2019). In the meantime I had bought another fan and put it in and figured I would swap the fans when the replacement from California would get here. I swap it out, and that fan is a dud too. I find myself incredibly frustrated with the situation and I’m writing this as a reminder to anyone, if it doesn’t work when you turn it on just return it and let them deal with the headache. Luckily I am still able to return this item and that’s what I intend on doing. I believe CyberpowerPC has a good reputation and a following based on who uses their PC’s but having someone wait around for almost 5 weeks for a fan replacement is insane. I’ll be returning tomorrow and starting off on my own build!",1,1,2019-11-16,0,6,0
Desktop was packaged really well. Out of the box just plug in and away you go. Good value for the money. I’ve read some reviews that it’s really loud but after using it extensively myself with some heavy gaming it’s actually quite the opposite. A good quality build that’s solid and the LED lights are nice to look at with numerous variations. I’d highly recommend this system to anyone looking for quality components at a very good price point.,5,1,2020-3-21,0,3,1

There is always one component that is compromised to arrive at a lower price.

It's always quiet even when playing high graphic games. With over 200+ FPS on games like CoD Modern Warfare, Rust, Fortnite and Sea of Thieves, it's outstanding!

"The tower is heavy because of the glass, which is fine, but plastic would have been fine and lighter. Depends on what you value I guess.The motherboard is Asus and the memory and ssd are both XPG.

There is also more static in my speakers than my previous PC, so don't expect to have them turned all the way up without some extra screeching noises. There's also no thunderbolt connector like my previous PC so stuck with plain old USB. There are only two USB 10GB connectors so if you like having lots of fast external SSD storage, don't count on connecting more than two at the same time without suffering speed loss.

"PC came in great condition with minor scratches but no big deal, instant plugged and play. Most games I played are at 100+fps average at 1080p. The cable management is great and everything was plugged properly but messy on the back panel. The fans are really loud and you should make your own custom fan curve as I noticed that while playing new games, the temp will go up pretty high. The ram frequency was set to base and you might need to use your BIOS to load your xmp profile for max ram speed. The motherboard has a lot of upgrade slots with 2 extra 4-pin fan connection and a M.2 ssd slot at the bottom of the motherboard with 4 more slots for Sata3 storage. Note: This MB has 6 connections for sata3, one or two sata3 port will be disabled if one or two  m.2 ssd is/are installed on the mother. There are also two fan slots at the top of the case and at the bottom. Another thing to mention is that turbo boost automatically gets enabled when playing games by default to 4600Mhz on all cpu cores, which is normal but will increase cpu temps. If you don't want the turbo boost however, you can always disable it through bios but keeping it on is also fine for a few extra fps and it will not damage your system.What components did I get?",5,1,2020-5-7,0,1,1

"Great PC made some modifications to it already, added ram and memory. it ran a bit hot so i added a top fan to boost airflow created custom fan curves, temps are now good! its 4k ready for sure!**side note verify all the connection before booting my fans weren't plugged to power in when i got it!**",5,1,2020-4-24,0,1,0
"Received the first one and none of the USB ports were working.  I spoke to Cyberpower first and they helped me troubleshoot the problem.  Unfortunately I had to send it back but got a replacement the next day.  The second one is great.  It performs better than I expected and I have had no issues thus far.  Alot of reviews I've read are slamming CP for shoddy components, poor service etc. but I am happy to say my experience has been nothing but great.",5,1,2020-4-12,0,0,0
"Doesn’t work. Received product today and hooked it up. Computer boots up but there is no output signal going to the monitor, tried a different cable and a second monitor, but still no output/picture. Checked to make sure all cables inside system were connected and everything sees fine there. What is really upsetting is amazon won’t issue a replacement for this item, I have to return the item wait up to two weeks for a refund and then reorder. Never again. I’ll pay an extra $20 bucks to shop at Bestbuy. At least if there is problem I can return to store right away.",1,1,2020-2-10,0,0,0

I love this PC and am super happy with it! The RGBs come with a remote and look beautiful. I calculated building this setup myself and it would have ended up costing more. Due to COVID the prices went up a bit but it’s still a great deal and is going to last me for a long time. I can play all games on high on 1080p and have 144fps - super happy with it. Highly recommend!,5,1,2020-6-18,0,0,0
This is nearly the ideal build for a high-end PC before you start paying premiums for luxury.First time buying a pre-built too; was online downloading games in probably under 20 minutes from it arriving at my door. Love not having to worry about anything,5,1,2020-4-2,0,0,0
"I can say I like mostly everything about the computer, it does exactly what you buy it to do, and even at a lower price then if you built it all yourself. Plus the mouse and keyboard are way better than I thought.The only downside I heard about of these pcs its the psu. Supossedly they use cheap psu and if you leave it there in the long run it could damage your computer. But all you have to do is like me and check newegg for a good psu, and you will still be below the cost to build yourself!",5,1,2020-2-26,0,0,0
"Without any discounts this PC (9700K GTX2070 super) was cheaper than custom made ones with similar specs.Arrived quickly, easy setup, works great. It came overclocked (4.6GHz, CPU only), which is great!",5,1,2020-4-13,0,0,0
"I got this 20% discount cuz of black friday but even at cost you could not build this computer yourself. They do skimp you in terms of motherboard (cheapest i7/i9 board) and the psu isn't name brand, but honestly you could do a lot worse than this pc. It'll do rendering, gaming, streaming, anything you throw at it, really really well. Wouldn't recommend overclocking on this MB tho (if I can even get it to overclock without BSOD)",5,1,2019-12-10,0,0,0
"Honestly, I was always one to never ever spend my money on a pre-built rig but once I saw the ad and the price I was reeled in. I bought the one with the intel i7 9700k and the rtx 2070 super with 16 gigs of ram for just over $1800 Canadian dollars. I ran through most of the parts that were included in this build and the total cost would have been a few hundred dollars more expensive. To be fair it was on sale for only a few days but I knew this was an amazing deal and I took advantage of it. 5 STARS",5,1,2020-1-17,0,0,1
"This gaming pc is great. Its great for gaming at 1440p, with completely flawless performance. It meets the recommended specs of EVERY game on the market today. You want to play GTA 5 at Ultra graphics on a 144 Hz monitor? This is the way to go! Its great for office use. Its great for my hobby of programming as well.

"Very good PC for gaming and everyday use.There was a little bit of vibration noise from the glass cover though. no more noise after I used scotch tape to hold the cover tight. Other than that I am very satisfied. It was a good choice. I have two LG 32 inch 4k monitors hooked up as dual monitors. This PC can handle two 4k@60hz videos (Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Prime and Etc) playing each screen at the same time just fine.",5,1,2020-1-3,0,0,0
Totally trash. I plugged al the cable and press the power button. Yes the desktop running but there is no signal received by the monitor. I tried to fixed it by reinstalling the vedio card.

I bought this just by looking at the specs and wow was I surprised to see the performance and the look of the CPU. It's gorgeous looking and the RGB lights of the fans can be controlled by a remote. They even gave two antennas for the WIFI support which really boosts the network speeds. The PC overall is a bang for your buck. I highly recommend it.,5,1,2020-5-8,0,0,1

Great PC for gaming processor and graphics will be good for the next couple years! Can run most new games on ultra 1440p with 70+ frames only thing I did to the pc was swap out the ram for some 3400 MHz compared to the 16 gb 2400 MHz they give you all though they did not give me screws to mount a second nvme drive for the azrock z390,5,1,2020-5-20,0,0,1
