"It's a good controller, but if this is as good as it gets, the future of racing games on the Switch is almost nonexistent, the two biggest flaws of this controller are the following:-The ridiculously expensive price tag.",3,1,2018-9-21,1,6,0
"Where to begin...I've always been fine with the Joycons, Handheld mode, in the grip, or one in each hand. I don't mind any of those control methods, nor do I find their D-Pad buttons to be a problem. But I bought this controller for Smash Ultimate and to see what all the fuss was about, because I don't want my Joycons breaking in a moment of carelessness.",4,1,2018-9-26,1,5,0
"Worked perfectly for a month. Then about two weeks ago I was playing Splatoon and I noticed that sometimes when I would be trying to run forward my character would instead walk very slowly. It has now gotten to the point where my character will completely halt for a solid 2 seconds before moving again. In Splatoon, this is absolutely game breaking. I've recalibrated and reset the controller a dozen times and nothing has fixed the problem.I couldn't find any option to contact the seller to ask for repair/replacement so I guess I'll have to go through Nintendo themselves. Very disappointed that I paid $70 for a controller that only worked for one month.",1,1,2018-3-10,1,9,0
"I can't imagine playing switch games without this controller. The regular controller is just a little bit off in how it's shaped and it just doesn't quite feel as comfortable as you want for most games and for playing a long time. The grips are really nice and the feel is clean and button presses are pretty crisp. This controller is very comfortable and surprisingly has the NFC built in for amiibo. The only gripe is that the NFC is in a weird spot and can be a little difficult to trigger. The battery life in this is really good and I've never gone a play session where it's gone dead. Charging doesn't seem to take that long either. If only they had more colors, like a Luigi green. The retail price is a little ridiculous, but it's worth it on sale.",5,1,2018-1-28,1,5,0
"I like this controller better than their WiiU Pro. What I don’t like is the price and that in order to use your old WiiU Pro you’ll need a dongle. They should add support for them, they really should. I prefer the shape on the WiiU Pro better but this one actually feels more comfortable to me. They finally offset the analogue joysticks which makes gaming easier. 40hr battery life vs the old at 80hrs is a step back but they use the exact same battery just this one has hd rumble and an nfc reader. 40hrs is still long enough for even a hardcore gamer. You don’t need the joycons to play the switch. I brought my switch screen and this controller to work and played Mario Kart during lunch. Left the joycons at home. I like that the buttons aren’t so tiny like on the joycons. I have average adult hands and the joycons are just too small for me. I can’t use them comfortably. This is the best wireless option without a dongle.",5,1,2018-2-19,1,5,0
"This is probably the most comfortably designed controller I've ever held. The buttons are nice and big and feel great to press, the weight is good, the sticks feel great, like all Nintendo analog sticks do. HD rumble and motion controls work fine and battery life is worlds ahead of the PS4 controller. The D-pad is a step down from typically Nintendo design though, having no ball underneath the center, so every direction can be pushed in at once, which can occasionally cause problems, but I've played a ton of Tetris and shovel Knight with it and it's still pretty solid. The erganomics are stellar though, to be sure. Feels better than any other controller that I can think of and I think the Xbox one S controller is pretty top notch comfort-wise. Also, with the right Bluetooth controller adapter it can be used on the PS3 and aside from the six axis crap not being present it works perfectly. I blasted through a good portion of uncharted with it just to test it. I bought mine used too which I'm normally leery of, but it's really study and I've had no issues at all. I love it.",5,1,2017-9-27,1,7,0
"Honestly a great controller. Better of course than the Joy-Cons that come with the Switch. The analog sticks are smooth in movement, the D pad suffices, the buttons aren't too small and the triggers are nice. Being an owner of a PS4 Pro and an Xbox One S its my opinion that the Pro Switch controller is the most comfortable I've used. Ergonomic and nice to hold. Shame it doesn't come with the Switch but the controller is a luxury to have so the purchase is worth it.",5,1,2017-5-30,1,6,0
"Ayo I picked up this controller cause I'm a piece of garbage who won't settle for the basic black one, and it got me curious about the game itself so I checked it out and almost 200 hours in Xenoblade later I can fully say this controller is a right slammer. Works just like a normal pro controller, plus it's reddish pink. Now not only can I be more insecure about my masculinity, but all my friends who know what xenoblade is can judge me for liking such a weird-ass game. What more could you want. Unfortunately, I wouldn't say it's worth the upwards of 100 dollars that it's listed for. Just get a normal pro controller if you're not a picky pile of human trash like me, or just use the joycons; you're only playing smash anyways ya jackass and you suck at it to boot.",4,1,2019-3-27,1,2,0
"I bought my Switch last year for Christmas for me from my husband ♥️. I love playing the Zelda games.The Joy controls took a little getting used to. I don't hate them but I don't love them either. I definitely did not want a corded controller, so the Pro A or Horipad wasn't an option (I think that is what they are called) so I just got used to the Joy con controls. My husband has really big hands so he really has a difficult time playing with the Joy Cons. He doesn't play the Switch that often so it wasn't a big deal. I didn't realize the Pro Controller had come out until recently but I didn't really want to spend the money at the time.",5,1,2018-11-28,1,2,1
"I expected this controller to work longer than 6 months. After very light use(I own a ps4, xbox and gaming pc) of the controller, within 6 moths the left joystick stopped working in the up position. I only use the pro controller when playing more than 2 player games like mario cart. I contact amazon support and nintendo support they told me the controller has past the 3 month nintendo accessory warranty, so an exchange is not possible. Nintendo mentioned a $40 dollar repair fee since it is out of warranty. Very disappointed with nintendo because the pro controller is very pricey. Again, I expected this to work longer than 6 months with very light use.",1,1,2019-3-16,1,2,0
Update 8/31/20: Upgrading back to 5/5 stars! Turns out I accidentally turned motion control on without knowing it. Once I found that and turned it off the issue was gone.Please ignore my negative comment below.,5,1,2020-8-27,1,1,0
"I bought one at Gamestop and the left joystick stopped working after a few months.  I sent it back to Nintendo under warranty thinking it was a fluke and bought another one while it was being repaired.  The first one came back and worked fine but then after a few more months both failed, out of warranty.  The problem seems to be the ball cover of the joystick top rubs against the round opening of the case and creates all sorts of plastic dust that gets into the joystick electronic switches and causes them to fail.  I opened up the case, blew out the electronics and it worked for a little bit but then the problem came back, even though I kept the joystick top clean.  I tried isopropyl alcohol to flush it, vacuumed it out and it worked afterwards for a week of heavy use but then failed again.  I was quoted $25 or $29 to repair.  But instead I bought a third party one and it has worked longer than the other two and continues to work.  Until they fix this design flaw don't throw your money away.  Shame because when it works, its smooth and responsive and has a very nice feel.",2,1,2018-8-6,1,6,0
"Fells a bit more traditional like an Xbox or PS controller.  The joycon seems a bit too easy to click the joystick down on accident while in the heat of battle that was the main reason I got this controller and for a bit more comfort.  The only problem I have with button layout is the + key is close to the Home key and the - is close to the capture button and it can be easy to confuse them or not feel comfortably certain you're gonna hit the right one while playing.  This is minor though as ur usually looking to pause anyway when going for those buttons and if u hit the wrong one it isn't terrible, also u get better as u use it I'm sure.  The joysticks have a lot of room for play yet don't seem to activate untill you've moved them about 50% towards the direction you're going.  Then the last 50% is where u have the control to manage speed.  I.E. if youre trying to walk slowly it feels like you have to move the joystick farther than you should have to before walking begins which leaves less room for control in the stride between walking and running.  This may be fixable in some sensitivity settings I'll have to play around.  Overall though great controller it feels much better playing Zelda with this over the joycon (which is decent itself with the grips)",5,1,2017-12-29,1,5,0
"This is a superb controller with a serious weakness! Five stars for the controller, 1 star for durability! The left toggle switch gets glitchy after two plus months or more depending on level of play, and it seems to be common from what I've read. None of the fixes worked for me. For $70 I expect it to last longer even under a lot of play time. Most reviews fault the left toggle.I bought it after I bought my Switch expressly to play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I found the JoyCons awkward for this game. It is a fabulous, sumptuous and gorgeously realized game. However since this started, it has gotten to be more consistent in it's glitch to the 180 position. Link trots along or runs away from monsters, and as soon as I stop him, he does an immediate about face and starts walking off!!! I can't have him walking blithely to his death every time he stops in a dangerous place. I have to keep pushing the toggle back to get him to finally stand still, and it's become ridiculous, so I'm forced to order another if I want to finish the game! He's walked off cliffs, stood up from a crouch to walk away and been peppered with arrows, scared away game, and drawn the attention of enemies all because this left toggle is suddenly massively glitchy. I tried canned air to blow out any dust, but it seems like a part failure. He almost walked of a Divine Beast in the middle of the air!",3,1,2018-6-28,1,1,0
"It's one of the most ergonomically comfortable video game controllers I've ever used. I have arthritis and cannot play on most controllers very long at all & this controller was a huge change for me, because now I can actually play video games for more than 20 minutes at a time again without pain. I like that you can also use it on PC for Steam games. I had some issues with mine where the plastic hand grips did not line up flush with the controller body and I had to return a few and do a Nintendo repair to finally get one that didn't have that issue, but that wasn't a serious issue and I think it's just that I really hate the feel of a noticeable edge on my hands. The controller does have an issue with the D pad sometimes registering the wrong inputs. I never noticed this problem until Tetris 99. For games like that or 2D platformers that require a lot of precise D pad inputs it is not the best controller. But for 3D games it works well. I loved playing Breath of the Wild with it.",4,1,2019-8-16,1,2,0
"While this is the best feeling Switch controller out there, the stick quality is awful, and it WILL break after a few months of good use. Everyone I know with one of these gets the same issues with the sticks. I just spent $200 on a soldering kit, replacement parts, and fixed my controller after several weeks' worth of practice. But you could just avoid all of that and not buy this thing.",2,1,2020-2-18,1,4,0
"Unfortunately the left joystick started drifting down after about 6 months. I'm not a pro smash player or anything, so it seems hard to fathom that I used it more intensely than most during that time. I also kept it really clean, regularly wiping off the residue that easily accumulates on this controller while in use with a soft, dry towel.The other sad part is that Nintendo isn't taking de-facto responsibility for this issue. After I contacted them, they informed me that Pro Controllers purchased outside of the console are only under warranty for 3 months. After I insisted that I would not pay any amount of money for a controller they call ""Pro"" that malfunctioned in 6 months and pointing out the similarities with the class-action joy-con suit, the rep put me on hold to see what he could do. After he returned, he offered me a ""one-time"" free repair.",2,1,2019-9-3,1,3,0
"The rumors that the D-pad was improved for the Xenoblade model appear to be true. I get far fewer unintended button presses on perpendicular axes with this unit than I do with my original dark gray unit. In my opinion, this is the best Switch controller currently available from a functional standpoint.The cosmetic design is quite good and matches the aesthetic of the game well, without being crass or visually busy. The controller also appears with red handles in the console controller menu, making it easy to distinguish at a glance.",5,1,2019-2-10,1,4,0
"El producto se pidió desde hace más de tres meses y no llegó, la tienda contestaba que reenviarán el producto pero tampoco llegaba, les pedí la devolución del dinero y lo único que han hecho ha sido evitar la comunicación al no contestar los mensajes que se les envían constantemente.",1,1,2019-4-9,1,8,0
"I keep giving Nintendo my money.  I bought it as I started playing Zelda BOTW and didn't particularly like playing with the joycons attached.  Hated to lay out another 70 bucks for a controller... but I did and I'm satisfied.  Build quality on this is better than my Xbox, and the battery lasts seemingly forever.  I love the feel of this compared to the Xbox controllers too.  Damn you Nintendo... now I have 4 joycons (for mario cart), plus an extra controller, plus a charger, plus the plastic steering wheels.  What will you make me buy next :).",5,1,2017-10-9,1,5,0
My left thumbstick broke with light use. The warranty is only 3 months which is not long enough for such an expensive product. The Nintendo Switch console has a 12 month warranty and so should this controller.,3,1,2018-1-10,1,2,0
"I purchased this when I ordered Super Mario Odyssey because my original Grey Joy-cons suffer from the notorious connection interference. This controller is absolutely amazing! It charges over the included USB-C cable that can be connected to one of the two front facing USB ports on the switch dock or any other USB that powers the device according to the specifications. It stays charged for a really long time especially compared to the PS4 controllers. I haven't quite expereienced the claimed ""40 hour lifespan"" that is advertised on the box but it is well over 30+ hours. If you prefer a traditional gamepad as opposed to the joycons I couldn't recommend this enough. It supports amiibo and features motion controls that can still be used in a range of games. Wonderful product!",5,1,2017-11-28,1,2,1
"I bought this thing because the joycons that came with my console started having issues that recalibrating was not fixing. I was so used to playing with joycons after a year of only using them. They were very comfortable as a controller in their own right, with or without the shell. I still want to get the joycons repaired or replaced someday when I get more multiplayer games/It took me a day to acclimate to the new controller, but it already feels just as, if not more comfortable than the joycons in the joycon shell. It's heavier but not uncomfortably so, it's comfortable to grip for a few hours of gameplay. Most of the buttons have decent feedback. The battery seems to be almost as good as the joycons were, I got mine last week and still haven't had to charge it since the first day.",5,1,2018-7-23,1,2,0
"I used my Wii U's Pro Controller so much that there is heavy wear marks on the analog stick hats.When I bought a Switch, I saw the price tag of this controller and thought it was ridiculous.  A gamer friend chided me, telling me I'd eventually get the Pro Controller.",4,1,2018-4-11,1,2,0
"This is fantastic. Bought so I could play Mario Kart with my 11yo on his new switch (joy cons + adult hands = no good, IMO) I let him figure out how to set it all up and he had it connected and working in less than a minute - so if an 11yo can do it, I suppose anyone can! We didn't bother with the directions. Definitely recommend for playing on the TV.",5,1,2018-1-28,1,1,0
"The Xenoblade pro controller looks and feels great. Big fan of the Xbox controllers. In many ways, I prefer this controller over that. Buttons are big, clicky and responsive. The thumbstick is nice and firm.But this controller is unreliable. I thought I was unlucky or got a defective but I've used two different pro controllers where both the thumbsticks drift even when brand new. Right out of the box, my Animal Crossing character moves without me touching the controller. And the camera moves too.",1,1,2020-4-19,1,3,0
"I play this mosty for PC games and steam. The controller has a nice feel to it and adds so much comfort to the hands from playing games in prolong time. Battery life is what makes this controller shine among the rest, long battery life is amazing, I charge my controller once or twice a month. It's really easy to sync bluetooth via PC to play games in steam.There are three things I do not like about this controller:",4,1,2020-8-9,1,0,1
"I really do enjoy this controller. It feels great in your hands, and I like the weight of it. It's basically a better-feeling version of the WiiU Pro Controller, for anyone who's used that.  70 dollars for it is way too much though, especially when part of that price tag has to do with it having stuff like 3D rumble. Unfortunately, it's pretty much mandatory if you want to play your Switch locally with friends, or even if you just want to play by yourself on your TV. (The joycons are fine as the tablet's controllers, but they're not great when you disconnect them to play on the TV.)This controller's saving grace is that it connects very easily to a computer, making it great for PC games with full controller support. It would be much more convenient if it was XInput, but oh well.",4,1,2018-3-5,1,4,0
"Ever since COVID, Nintendo Switch has been nothing but a life savor keeping my families stay sane and entertained.However, we only have the original mini controllers that came with the Switch console and a poke ball to play with Pokemon Go, so everyone at my family takes turns so it’s been a battle to fight over controller constantly.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,1
Gives such a huge advantage for sport games and especially Fortnite. This makes me wanna play the switch more often. Won't leave without it.Update :,3,1,2018-7-20,1,4,0
Very rare 5 star reviewUPDATE:,5,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"When reviewers say that the Pro Controller (Pro Con) is the controller that should have been the default or should have been the quality used instead of the quality used in the Joy-Con, they were right. The difference is a world apart. The button travel (of buttons ABXY and the shoulder buttons) is too deep for me, however - deeper than the XBox One controller (though not as deep as the XB1's analog shoulder buttons). Limited travel buttons would make the Pro Con even better.The comfort grip - the lower, burgundy portion of the Pro Con - is just plastic. It is dimpled, so it has a texture feel. The back is also burgundy, but it is not textured.",5,1,2018-5-12,1,4,0
"I got this within a week of buying the Switch, and probably the one piece of advice I heard from everyone is ""just buy the Pro Controller from Nintendo"". I got a cheap 3rd party authorized USB controller while I was buying games in store, played some games but quickly just decided to grab the Pro Controller. After I used it, I realized why everyone loves it. It's almost perfectly built, feels great and natural, and so many features for the controller. Wireless works fantastically, battery lasts forever, Rumble feels good, and the motion controls work wonderfully. The motion controls are probably the biggest here - I didn't realize that games on the switch actually depended on the motion controls, which I really missed out on when I had a third party controller. With this, there's so many opportunities for motion control to provide a natural third joystick, especially in games like Breath of the Wild. Works fantastically. My only gripe is that, since it is so convenient, I love to just throw it in my backpack with my switch and its case, and go out for the day. However, there's nothing supplied to help protect the joysticks in transit. I would have loved to see easily detachable thumbsticks, or some kind of bumper, so that I can quickly store + access the controller without needing a protective case or worrying about the condition of the joysticks getting jostled. I know that's not really a trend with many comparisons, like xbox or playstation, but given what I heard about this controller having long-term issues with thumbsticks, it would make sense to me.",5,1,2019-6-20,1,1,0
I would 100% recommend any one that has a switch getting this because the joycons are not very durable. I have had my switch for a few months and the joycons are already having problems from just regular use (I am not a huge gamer maybe play this a few hours a week). The left joycon stick is messed up and will keep inputting that I am pressing forward to move character when I have stopped this has caused me to walk off many a cliffs in breath of the wild. Get this and use it anytime you are playing in docked mode cause the joycons will just not last.,5,1,2018-5-10,1,5,0
"I figured I'd be happy with the stock Joy Con controllers in the handle.  My hands are smaller than most gamers, so it was relatively comfortable for me to use them, until I tried to play Mario Kart with my brother with the individual Joy Cons...  Even my smaller hands aren't tiny enough to work them comfortably, and they aren't evenly matched since the buttons are sort of off kilter as a pair.I needed a second controller if I wanted to play properly with someone else.  Enter this beauty!  The Pro Controller instantly has a great feel right out of the box, with a nice sure weight that comes from its rumble pack and internal battery.  It works great if you have problems using the smaller Joy Con controller in its handle accessory.  The controller charges relatively quick, and pairing is easy with the console once you've plugged the charge cable into the Switch base at least once.",5,1,2017-11-28,1,1,0
"I have been a Nintendo Switch owner for almost a year, and while I love the joy-con controller and grip overall, sometimes I prefer a more reliable and ""traditional"" controller.  I finally picked this controller up on amazon this week.  I love it.  This is one of the most comfortable controllers I have ever used, which increases the enjoyment of my Switch games even more.  The battery life is good, the layout makes sense, and it has built in motion-sensors for gyro-scope aiming, which comes in handy for games like ""Splatoon 2"" and ""Zelda: Breath of the Wild.""  The only major downside to this controller is that the button layout for the ""pause"" and ""home"" buttons took a while to get used to, partially since the color scheme can make the buttons look similar.  Other than that, I have no real issues with this controller; the battery life is good, and the controller itself is very comfortable, maybe matching the Gamecube controller as my favorite Nintendo controller.  I would recommend picking this controller up for your switch.  I spent months playing hours of Zelda: Breath of the Wild but worried about the stability of the controller I was using to some extent.  Now I can comfortably sit back and play Breath of the Wild for even more hours on end with a controller that feels great!  The controller is a little pricey, but more than worth it.  So pick it up, and enjoy many hours of fun and comfortable gaming!Peace,",5,1,2018-4-14,1,8,0
"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! TAKE MY MONEY, NINTENDO!THE GOOD: Really good bluetooth range, no input interruption while playing the Switch docked from about 10 feet away. Feels great in my hand, and the larger buttons are nice. The D-pad is very responsive and feels as good as the classic D-pads Nintendo has made in the past. Pairing was a cinch and the battery last a long time on one charge.",5,1,2018-9-22,1,6,0
I bought this last March and all was great. But today the left analog stick broke while playing Mario Tennis. I heard and felt a pop in the left analog stick.Now it will either not recognize down input or the controller gets stuck and keeps the left input pressed. I can hear something broken inside the controller.,1,1,2019-1-18,1,2,0
Didn’t pay attention that the description say “used-like new” which isn’t the case. The controller frequently inputs Right on the joystick as if I was holding it down when I’m not. If this has ever happened to one of your controllers you know it is extremely frustrating & basically makes the controller unusable in most cases. It’s unfortunate I work overseas in a remote location so I don’t have the luxury of just going to the post office to return this. So I left this review to show my frustration. NEVER BUY USED CONTROLLERS.,1,1,2020-7-4,1,3,0
"This is a great controller, in my opinion it's worth the extra money to get this over the other aftermarket switch controllers, much more comfortable than the joycons, but still a little too small for people with large hands, you'll find yourself with one finger covering the shoulder buttons instead of two like you could comfortably do with an Xbox or PS4 controller. This is technically compatible with PC but you will have to use it wirelessly, and due to some odd bug the gyro glitches out the DirectInput controls if you have this enabled in Steam... so you have to manually choose between DirectInput OR steam, can't do both at the same time, with that said you'll still want to have an XBOX controller on hand for the occasional PC game where you find yourself wanting a controller. Otherwise this is great and a must have if you want to play really long games on your switch like Xenoblade or FE3H.",5,1,2020-10-2,1,1,0
"Out of the box, didn’t work. Kept having to connect then disconnect. It kept getting out of sync every hour and a half, which was a small inconvenience until the y and r buttons had a huge delay when 2 inches away. Then after a *months* use, it slowly turned into thirty minutes. For 80$ I really expected this to be good.. I would really love to return this and get sent a new copy because I believe I may have gotten a damaged version. I would return it but the window is closed.. I would really love to get in contact with an amazon employee, so I can get a refund.. I guess I’m stuck with a controller that disconnects frequently. If you are going to buy this, don’t buy it from amazon. Buy it from your local store.",1,1,2018-7-26,1,6,0
"As much as I love the Nintendo pro controllers, the one I ordered came flawed. When mine arrived, I noticed it suffered from a condition labeled by the Switch community as ‘drift’, more commonly associated with the joycons. If you don’t know, what this means is my left joystick, at a neutral position, will slightly drift to the left without a physical input. This is kinda annoying, but now I’ve had mine for almost half a year, and it hasn’t bothered me much since. There’s no fix to this thats ‘user friendly’, since an at home way of fixing it requires disassembling the controller and messing around with the internal electronics.I’m ordering another one in time for xmas for my girlfriend, but know your controller may arrive with drift.",4,1,2020-9-6,1,1,0
"Very awesome controller. It feels good. Has decent weight and the battery can last over 80hours i am hearing. I only charged it once so far and its been 2 weeks and I use it every day. Not sure if its just a massive battery or the tech is just better. I can't get over 7 to 10 hours in my ds4 controller or over 12 with mt xbox controller with bigger mah batteries. So its really dope to see this. My only complaint is I wish the top was a bit skinnier as well as the buttons, but that is where the nfc chip goes and I wish it had bluetooth for headsets because the switch doesn't and the bluetooth adapters I've gotten for the switch have been terrible.  Another thing I wish it has was an actual toggle switch to flip A and B buttons for people play a lot of ps4 where X is select and circle is back but on a switch A is where circle is and B is where X is. Even when you switch it in the switches settings games struggle to understand what you are doing so it ends up becoming a mess. Other than that the controller is great. Only once did I have drift but I think that was my Joycons doing that.",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"If you know what a good controller is then you will understand how terrible this controller is. The fact that there is no microphone jack for a 70$ controller is horrible, the fact that Nintendo is based around games that use a d-pad and this is the worst d-pad they have ever released because it misreads your inputs is shameful and half a scam. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CONTROLLER. You can get a good controller for half the price of this thing that will fit all your needs casual or competitive. And if you’re worried about the amiibos, don’t. Your joycons have the feature so you don’t need to waste your good money on this junk. DISGUSTED",1,1,2019-8-1,1,1,0
"I was hesitant to buy this because of the price tag but pulled the trigger because my left joy con was drifting really bad. I was so excited to get this in the mail thinking that all my problems with drifting would go away. BOY WAS I WRONG. Opened the box, connected it, played animal crossing for a couple mins and BAMMMM my character would drift down to the left. Swear it wasn’t even out the box for a hour n it was already drifting. For $100 you’d think it would last. :( so sadUPDATE:",1,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
"The controller is great when it works.  A few months out the left controller stick started to ""drift"" (as many people have complained about in other reviews as well) and when I contacted warranty support they claimed it had only a 90 day warranty -- even though the warranty PDF on the amazon site under warranty information says ""hardware"" has a 12 month warranty.  Seems like they should clarify what ""hardware"" is in their warranty -- seems like a controller is ""hardware"" to me.  Also seems like they should fix/correct the defect in their product since this appears to be a very common problem.",1,1,2019-8-15,1,1,0
"I love the artwork and color choice for this controller. As this is my first Pro Controller on the Nintendo Switch, it works great. Has the same ""rumble"" feel as the joycons (JOY CON BOYZ) and is just a lot easier in your hands which = less cramps, better ergonomics and thus gameplay is enhanced.Charges with a USB-C cable included in the box. Nothing much else to say. This is great for Xenoblade Chronicles 2/Switch fans and those who love the color theme!",5,1,2017-12-5,1,1,0
"i bought this controller months ago when i first dove into the Nintendo switch for the upcoming super smash bro ultimate game that was coming out later this year.  i think i used it once when i got the geezless thing when i first got it and just left it and the console plugged in for a few months seeing that i really only bought it for smash. today the day before release i thought id give the thing a go just to make sure everything was fine and ready to go for when smash releases and the stupid thing wont connect. ive updated the system, ive updated the controllers, i plugged it into the dock and the damn thing will not connect. i even did a factory reset. you hit the sync button and the lights just go back and forth endlessly. and smash is legit hours away from going live too..",1,1,2018-12-6,1,1,0
"I bought two of these. They are great controllers.  Unfortunately, on one of them,  the left joystick activates downward every few seconds.  It has a mind of its own. This is devastating in Zelda BotW.  Yea, I’ve recalibrated, blah blah.  Several times.  Turns out this is a regular defect.  Just google it.  For $60, that’s shameful.  You can watch it on the calibration screen.  Just randomly jolts downward when I’m not even touching it.",2,1,2019-3-22,1,1,0
"Update: Purchased this just over a year ago and the controller is having alot of glitching issues. Expected better purchasing an official Nintendo product. Specifically purchased Nintendo name brand for that reason. I can't recall if I was offered a warranty when I purchased, but it doesn't appear I purchased one. If it offers you one... Take it! We paid over $70 for this, so would have been worth the warranty.  Nintendo, this really should have lasted more than a year.Previously review:",2,1,2017-8-10,1,5,0
"So I purchased this Nintendo Switch Pro Controller on a deal for about $50, which is a super deal. Regardless of the price the Pro Controller has been an awesome companion for my Nintendo Switch and now more, sinde Joy-Cons started drifting.This controller is wireless, no crazy delay, and it works! Love it comfortable to play with.",5,1,2019-9-9,1,2,0
Very disappointed. I was excited to get this controller that everyone has been praising for being ergonomic and having a long battery life. Here are the problems I found:- The thumb pads are not sticky enough so my thumbs kept sliding around and I had to put a lot of pressure to keep my thumbs on without sliding. This was tiring.,2,1,2020-1-15,1,1,0
"I was torn between buying this Pro controller or another set of Joy Con controllers + grip. The latter was actually more expensive but naturally you could turn the Joy Con into two smaller controllers, accommodating more players. However, I went with the Pro Controller and haven't regretted it since. I use my Switch docked 70% of the time and this controller makes gaming on it perfect. The build quality is superb, the buttons are responsive and it just feels premium. I've been using it for about 20-30 hours so I'll be sure to make an update around the 1 month mark (which is when it seems the left joystick craps out on a lot of these controllers). If you play a lot of solo games docked, get this controller. The Joy Con + grip is definitely serviceable, but take your game up a notch with the pro especially if you play games like Splatoon 2. Highly recommended, so far.",5,1,2018-7-17,1,2,0
"This controller just may replace the second-gen Sega Saturn joypad as my favorite first party controller ever.  It's comfortable as can be to hold, but I have just one concern.  The analog sticks rub on the face of the controller and wear the plastic down, it's white powder around either analog stick.  I just hope Nintendo is going to be supporting to their loyal players in a year or so when these things start wearing out.Back in the N64 days, the Nintendo customer service number on the sticker on every Nintendo product took care of their gamers and they sent me three new N64 Analog sticks for the controllers that got worn out for free.  Just the analog sticks, and I had to take apart the controllers to put them in.",4,1,2019-3-10,1,0,0
"When I picked up my Switch a few years ago, I picked up a pro controller to go with it. Why? Because I knew that I would use it on my TV a lot, plus with bigger games like Zelda Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey, I knew I would enjoy them much more with a standard controller. The pro controller reminds me a little of an Xbox controller, but a little bulkier. However, after time, it really fits your hands well. It's high quality and again, awesome to use if the Switch is either your main gaming console or your only gaming console (which it is for me). I also love it for games like Super Smash Bros, DOOM, Witcher 3, Skyrim and other titles. I would say, though, with the expensive asking price, if you use your Switch mostly in handheld mode or if you are only a casual gamer, or do most of your major gaming on another console/PC, then I'd probably pass on picking one of these up.",4,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
"Was exactly what was advertised and works great with the console. One issue I have run into is when using it with any kind of emulator on the computer, the joy stick does not seem to be calibrated correctly. Using the OpenEmu emulator, during many games the character will not go into a full run forwards, and will go ridiculously fast if I pull back making them go in reverse. I do not notice this with the games on the consoles I’ve played on, so maybe they are able to adjust for the miscalibration while the computer programs just can’t seem to calibrate it totally correctly. My solution has been to switch the controls to the D-pad while playing emulated games. Overall, it’s great though, and much more comfortable than the joy-con controllers that come with the Switch.",4,1,2019-6-3,1,1,0
"I finally upgraded to the pro controller after much time contemplating if it would really make a difference to me. I've been using the joycons since the launch of the Switch and while not perfect I can still appreciate their design concept.The one aspect of the pro controller that had me on the fence were the triggers. Honestly, that is the one thing I really don't like about the joycons. Everything else about the joycons I can work around. Well, pictures don't do the pro controller justice, the triggers are absolutely fantastic and I certainly don't see myself ever using the joycons again when it comes to playing games that utilize the triggers extensively.",5,1,2019-2-1,1,0,0
"Ended up returning. The joysticks on the controller are much different than on the joycons that come with the Nintendo switch. Personally, after playing in handheld mode, and switching to the docked version playing with the pro controller, I noticed the joysticks are much bigger and you have to push them “farther” to get any response in the game. So it felt as though there was a lag after using the joycons which have as much “smaller” or I guess “shorter”? Joystick. For me, I did not like the button design shape or size, as it did not enhance my playing experience",1,1,2019-1-17,1,7,0
"At $70 (I guess they recently lowered the price to $60), this thing really ought to at least operate correctly. I mean, sure, everything on it functions as intended... except the left joystick likes to ""drift"" and register inputs that aren't being made... even when it isn't in use at all. Lovely.The d-pad is middling at best... there are plenty of better third-party options out there, especially the 8BitDo controllers like the M30. The Pro feels fine and all, but that drift... oh, and the placement of the Home, Capture, +, and - buttons are kind of odd, making it very easy to hit something you didn't intend to. Sure, it has amiibo support which no third-party products can have (and do we reeeeeally care?), but so do the Joy-Cons that came with the system.",2,1,2020-2-28,1,1,0
"I purchased this to play Skyrim on the Switch, particularly in docked mode.  Now, the Switch comes with a plastic holder that you can slot the half controls into to create a standalone controller for free.  I'll call this the ""standard"" controller further down.  So, why pay $60 or so for this?Well, in contrast to the standard Switch standalone controller, this has a very different feel to it.  Because the controller is larger, the left-thumb control has a lot more ""play"" to it.  This means there is more distance from the center to the ends.  This gives me more precise control in-between the edges when using this than the standard Switch controller.  And that can be crucial for some games.  The standard Switch thumb control can only move a very short distance from center to end, making precise control between the edges much harder.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
This is a Great Controller albeit at a price that's harder to swallow.I bought this alongside 8BitDo's SN30 Pro+ and both controllers have their pros and cons...,4,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"Bought this so controlling the Switch would be easier, obviously. This works so much better than the Joycons. I like to play Overcooked where it’s really essential that you turn and pivot real fast and with the Joycons, sometimes I just want to smash something because it just will not register at all. This is all fixed with the Pro Controller although I only got one so basically my boyfriend and I have to fight for it.I hate that it’s so expensive but it’s also so ’necessary’ so Nintendo just takes all my money and I guess I’m okay with it. Battery lasts pretty long and charging is easy through USB-C. It also supports Amiibo so I don’t know anything about that. It definitely feels better and is more comfortable as well than the Joycons in the controller shell. Clearly a sales tactic. But it’s working.",5,1,2019-9-6,1,1,1
"This makes playing the Switch much easier. I don't have huge hands, but after two hours of playing using the Joy Con controllers (both attached and detached from the console), my hands felt stressed and a bit cramped.This controller feels like it was made of a higher quality than most and is somewhere between the PS4 DualShock 4 and the Xbox Pro Controller in terms of feel and quality. I absolutely love it and after playing for about 10 hours on it over the past week, I can say that if you intend to play Breath of the Wild or any other games on your TV that require a controller, this is the way to go.",5,1,2017-3-10,1,7,0
"I've bought two of these. They feel great, but the left joystick breaks after about 40 hours of use from white dust that collects under the joystick. The fix is to buy a new controller or disassemble and solder in a replacement joystick costing $12.",1,1,2018-12-29,1,6,0
"For a 70 dollar controller, this thing feels FLIMSY. If you lightly shake it left and right, you can hear stuff moving in them. And the grip handles of the controller are wobbly . Not built to last it seems. But love the feel and look of it. Nintendo needs to step up.",1,1,2020-4-7,1,3,0
"If you are a switch owner, this is a must have controller. This is probably my favorite controller of all time. The way it fits in my hands, it becomes a part of you. The buttons are clicky and the directional pad is much better than using the joycons. The battery life is amazing and it charges quickly through USB-C.If this worked cross platform fluidly, this would be my go to controller for all video games. It's very similar to the Xbox One controller, but the grips are a little bit thinner and I'm just able to get a more solid grip than the Xbox One controller.",5,1,2019-1-8,1,7,1
"UPDATE MAY 2020: Not that badSo after I wrote my initial review, I was able to get the stripped screw off (and destroyed the grip in the process, having to order replacements from ebay). Then over the ensuing months I tore apart the controller probably 20 times, trying different variations of the tape trick to fix the D-pad with varied success. The tape did largely correct the false inputs, but at the cost of sometimes not registering button presses. In the end, I decided to take off all the tape and use it as it was originally designed to be used, and guess what? It isn't all that bad. Sure, when you do the input test in Switch settings it registers LOTS of false inputs, but this is less noticeable during actual game play. Now granted, I'm not a professional gamer, but I used the D-pad extensively to play Rayman Legends and Super Mario Maker, and it worked just fine. So in conclusion, yes, the D-pad is far from perfect, it's a major blemish in an otherwise perfect controller and a disgrace for Nintendo, but NO, it is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It's probably still the best Switch controller out there at the time of writing. My advice is to buy it and spend some time actually using it before buying into all the negative hype and trying to mess with it. It really isn't all that bad. (with regards to my original review, everything I had said about the design and ergonomics still holds true, even with the aftermarket replacement grips I had to install).",4,1,2020-2-3,1,4,0
"This controller is fantastic at first, but is destined to have problems. Know that if you buy a Pro Controller, chances are, you WILL have problems down the line. It's such a bummer that this is a common issue among Switch owners. I take great care of my things, and my Pro controller has 2 significant problems after about 6 months of use.1) Left stick issues. When pushing the left stick upwards, the controller experiences what I've been calling ""reverse drift"" -- it pulls the input down. I've calibrated dozens of times, and this fixes the issue momentarily, but it always comes back.",1,1,2019-11-27,1,6,0
"This thing feels really well built. The controller has a good quality feel to it, plus it feels just the right weight to make it feel secure in my hands. At first it felt a little big since I had been using the joycons mostly, but i quickly got used to it. The price can be a bit hard to justify, but i paid it since I knew that it wasnt a gamble. There are cheaper options out there that might feel this good, but i knew FOR SURE, that this one would be good. And it didnt dissapoint.Pros:",5,1,2019-2-18,1,0,0
"I personally love the pro controller. However, mine came completely defective straight out of the box. I even bought mine brand new figuring I’d have less of a chance of getting a defected one. I bought a pro controller about a year ago for a friend and hers works beautifully and hasn’t had any issues since- but mine came with a drifting control pad and half the buttons didn’t work, had severe lag, or didn’t have any response whatsoever. I tried updating the controller but there were no updates for it. I was having issues with my right control paddle that came with the switch console so I got the pro to avoid that, only to get a controller that had more issues right out of the box. Amazing. Nintendo has seriously forsaken the quality of their newer controllers. I expect much better from a product that costs so GD much.",1,1,2020-4-14,1,4,0
"...the Directional Pad is *very* subpar. If you're only going to use it for accessing features or items like in Super Mario Odyssey or Breath of the Wild, it works just fine. However if you're going to use it for retro or 2D games it leaves much to be desired. There's no central pivot point like in most every good D-Pad allowing you to hit Up, Down, Left, and Right at the same time and they are sensitive so you will be hitting directions you don't mean to. There's ways to modify it and there's tutorials all over YouTube, but you will have to disassemble the whole thing to do it. I have yet to do it but people have said it makes it a lot better.That said everything about this controller is fantastic. It's not a nice weight, feels quality. It is by far the most comfortable controller I've ever held. It lasts seemingly forever. It says 40 hours but I've yet to put a dent in the battery icon even after extended play. Motion controls are flawless and precise. If it wasn't for the D-Pad I'd say this is the best controller ever made. I don't know why Nintendo dropped the ball on that considering they are the ones who perfected them.",4,1,2019-6-25,1,4,0

For example, in Splatoon while moving through the plaza the character will run, then walk very slowly, then stop, then walk slowly again, then run. It’s not reliable for gameplay.We have no complaints about the second controller. Battery life is very strong.",2,1,2019-5-19,1,5,0
"This takes an almost perfect controller and fixes my one complaint, the ""D"" pad.  There is now a pivot for the ""D"" pad which fixes any issues with pushing directly up or left and right without it going in both directions at the same time.  The design is very nice, but I do wish the red was more bright.  It is more of a pink than a red, but that is a tiny non-function affecting preference.

"Out of 4 new controllers, all of them eventually developed problems. Either the joystick starts giving weird feedback (like moving forward is jerky), or the d-pad starts messing up. Tetris 99 is UNPLAYABLE with my pro controller because about 30% of the time I hit the left button, it also triggers the top button which drops the block down. When I play with the joycon, I have no problems.These controllers feel great to use until they stop working properly.

"Nintendo. I am very displeased. The Joycons have this issue already, and I didn't expect it from this.

I will include links to those reviews below:In short, for RUMBLE effects, the Nintendo is more subtle and responsive-- the others work fine but the rumble is a bit overdone. Otherwise, the generic controllers are both terrific. Nintendo wins the battery life battle but in practical terms this is a non-issue.

I had mine for about a year and it stopped working.  It felt cheap and in the end, it was indeed cheaply made.  With the Switch Pro Controller, we finally get a high quality handheld controller.  It feels great in your hands and I would say it's a must-have for docked gaming.  Some complain about the d-pad but I haven't had any issues thus far.  It's a bit expensive but it feels expensive (more so than the last Nintendo Pro controller); there's a certain heft to it. (It's not heavy but it's nicely weighted.)

It's expensive for a typical controller, but it's worth it because of the motion control; however, as I mentioned, it's got a big defect that definitely needs looking into.

"It's a great controller. If you're looking to use something that feels more like a modern controller than the double joycon configuration then this is where it's at. The d-pad is always welcome. The layout feels much less cramped. The sticks feel sturdier and more substantial. The + and - buttons are much easier and more comfortable to access. The only downsides to the pro controller are that it uses standard rumble instead of HD rumble, it doesn't disconnect to operate as two controllers, and it costs an extra sum of money on top of the system itself. But for the amount of playtime you'll get out of it and the comfort it will afford you, it's easily worth the money.

The sticks are too small, and I feel like that whole controller is better suited for portability and smaller hands.The price of one of these controllers is HALF of what it costs to get a second set of Joycon controllers and a grip, so I was a little worried that it was going to feel cheap and unpleasant to hold. Thankfully, this isn't the case.",5,1,2019-1-4,1,0,0
"I waited a few weeks to order this, so I had plenty of time with the Joy Cons in different configurations.  But for games like Zelda: Breath of the Wild I found the Joy Cons attached to the default dumb controller attachment that comes with the Switch to be a little wanting.  My hands are a bit larger, so it's very nice to have a larger full controller to work with.One thing I did experience, the first time I sync'd the controller to my Switch I did have some small instances where the controllers tilt functionality was hesitant or laggy. (Example: When using my bow in BotW, it just didn't want to fine tune my targeting by tilting the controller.)  But it seemed to correct itself after only a few minutes of use and I've never experienced the issue again.",4,1,2018-2-7,1,2,0
"The Switch Pro Controller works pretty well, but I wish there was a hard-off, as it will turn itself on in travel and if you are using your Switch in handheld mode and someone or something messes with the Pro Controller, it will hijack your game. This also can prematurely drain the battery. It is comfortable to hold on my medium to large sized hands and a bit daintier than the replaceable battery version by the same brand. Charging is convenient with the same cable I would use for the Switch. Can be used plugged in. After a while of use thumb caps tried to pop off. I make sure they are seated well before a session of play.",4,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"I tried the xbox 360 controller route with an adapter-- which I loved, but there was lag and dropped connectivity from time to time-- which was hellllllaaaa annoying. i decided to get an actual nintendo controller, and I gotta say I am very happy with it that I got 2 more. The only thing is that the LEFT/RIGHT may sometimes act like UPPER LEFT or UPPER RIGHT.. so playing something like tetris 99, you might accidentally do a hard drop when you didn't mean to. There's a youtube video online that shows you how to fix that by leveling the D-PAD up, haven't tried it yet. Overall it feels good in the hand because those joy-cons are too tiny. Also the officially licensed nintendo ones,  PowerA, those are not rechargeable-- you gotta use batteries. happy I got these, you can just use the USB wires to charge.",5,1,2019-4-25,1,0,0
UPDATE:Don't go refurbished on these in my opinion. Never was able to charge the controller. The orange light indicating charge never came on. Unfortunately have to return this bad boy.,1,1,2020-4-14,1,1,0
"I love this controller. I own the switch obviously and the Xbox one and ps4 and this is my favorite controller out of all 3. It is not only a fantastic design but it also feels as good as it looks, making the long gaming sessions of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 that much more enjoyable. In my opinion it was well worth the extra 5 dollars for the looks. Also the buttons are the same ""emerald green which I didn't notice at first but is a great touch. Would highly recommend this product.",5,1,2017-12-5,1,5,0
"Thia controller is awful. I bought it to replace my other controllers that have joystick drifting issues and as soon as I turned thia new one on to use it, it started drifting horribly.

"I bought this recently so I can start playing some games with my older son. He's been all over Let's Go Pikachu for months now but we recently picked up Smash Bros. Ultimate and Fire Emblem Warriors. This controller style is very similar to the original Xbox controllers after they reduced the size from the original monstrous ones, which I actually liked.Playing Smash Bros. on the Joy Cons is very difficult for me, maybe because I'm from an other generation that is used to everything being on one device. Having the Joy Cons separated and trying to do combos was very tedious as the buttons weren't where I expected them to be as a result of my arms moving around during game play. I could attach them to the static controller accessory that comes with the system but for me that's too much work. When I want to play, I want to play. I don't want to fiddle with accessories much unless it's going to bring a major enhancement to the game play.",5,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0
"Nintendo knocked it out of the park with this one! It's as comfortable as a PS4 controller with the analog-pad-stickiness of an XBOX one. The D-pad, which isn't separated like the Joycon's, is much better for fighting games.The battery lasts a long time and I LOVE that Nintendo decided to use the USB-C standard for charging. As it becomes more ubiquitous, I think most people will appreciate this as well. Now I can bring one charger for my laptop, switch and controller when on travel.

I'm glad I had!",5,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0
"This is honestly the best controller I've had since the Wavebird, back in the Gamecube days. I own a Switch, but I really got this for my PC.If you haven't connected it to a Nintendo Switch in your house, you can use the bluetooth functionality to play it wirelessly on PC. But once it's been connected to Switch, you'll need a USB-C to connect it to the computer.",5,1,2020-4-27,1,1,0
"Every button on this feels amazing, the controller feels very solid. And built in battery too is great. I had to get this because I sit about 10ft away from my TV and the joycons seem to have trouble at that range. This has complete solid connection and fixed my issue, but after using it I realized just how uncomfortable the joycons are relative to this. If you like using the switch docked a lot it’s definitely worth the buy. And you’ll have two controllers for split screen as a bonus. I have quite large hands and this feels like it was made for me",5,1,2018-2-10,1,3,0
"I think that this controller is the best controller that you can buy at the moment. It fits well in your hand, it functions almost perfectly (the d-pad is below average, but not awful, better than og gc controllers), has a long battery life (it hasn’t run out on me since I bough it), and has seemingly no input delay. So why don’t I give it 5 stars? Because there are a bunch of tiny things I have gripes with that don’t apply to 99% of games. I think that the tops of the control sticks are too wide, but I enjoy the c-nub that comes on the gc controllers that a lot of people dislike. I like to slide my fingers over the face buttons when mashing our of grabs in smash, and these buttons roll a little to much for my liking. The fact that the sticks also don’t have notches are good in some scenarios but bad in others (an example is when trying to do macro wavebounce neutral specials in smash; it’s harder to do them bc of the lack of notches, but much it’s easier to play shooter games like warframe and splatoon). The point I’m trying to make is that, if you’re not me, you won’t have any problems with this controller at all, other than the d-pad being bad.",4,1,2019-2-21,1,0,0
"If I had to pick my favorite controller from this generation of say that the Nintendo Switch Pro beats put the Xbox One Pro Controller and the PS4 dualshock. Comfortable grip for long play sessions, responsive buttons, comfortable sticks. As all controllers however I have my gripes. The D-pad, although far better than the buttons on a Joy-Con, is not the best Nintendo has ever put on a controller. This disappoints me a lot, I've owned many Nintendo systems and their D-pads have always been the best in the industry so to see this decline is a personal gripe I can't help but share. I do prefer triggers with feedback, but you won't miss much with the simple button like design on this. The biggest merit of the Pro Controller is the built in gyro, playing shooters is a far far better thing with this gyro enhanced aiming. Don't believe me? Play Splatoon 2 with and without it. Although awkward as you get your berrings, it will soon become natural and you'll find yourself unable to shake the habit of expecting all controllers you use to react to your subtle hand motions.Good controller, would recommend.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"This controller doesn't require one to have large hands like the X-Box.I originally bought a ""PXN"" off brand pro controller for my Switch. Well, surprise, that one ended up with left stick drift after a mandatory Switch firmware update. Factory reset it multiple times and it starts to drift again within a couple minutes. This only happens when paired with the Switch. When paired with my PC or my Pi it works fine.",5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
"I have large hands, and I find that most controllers are smaller than I'd like (many are much smaller than I'd like). It's been years since I used a controller that I thought was large enough to sit well in my hands (Logitech used to make one that I really liked, but it's probably been at least 15 years since they stopped making it, and their more recent controllers are all much smaller). Historically, the Playstation controllers have been particularly bad. The PS4 controller is much better than previous generations, because they adjusted the shape to make it less cramped, but it's still too small. The XBox One controller is a much better size, but for me at least, it hurts my hands to use the RB and LB buttons because of how I have to twist my hands to press them (whereas with the PS4 controller, it's really easy to move my fingers between the R1/L1 and R2/L2 buttons). The Switch Pro Controller is not quite as large as I would like, but it sits far better in my hands then either of those controllers (or any 3rd party controller that I've tried in recent years), and while it's not quite as easy to move my fingers between R/L and ZR/ZL on the Switch Pro Controller as it is  on the PS4 controller, it's close. So, for me at least, the Switch Pro Controller is far more comfortable than either the XBox One or PS4 controllers (or any 3rd party controller that I've found in recent years). So, from a comfort standpoint, this controller is a _huge_ win for me. No other controller is even close.I very much wish that the analog sticks were lined up like they are with the PS systems. Most of the controllers that I've used over the years have had the analog sticks on the same level, and I much prefer that to having them staggered like the XBox systems do and the Switch Pro Controller does. However, the comfort improvements with the shape and size of the controller vastly outweigh that problem for me.",5,1,2019-1-31,1,0,0

"I bought this thing because the joycons that came with my console started having issues that recalibrating was not fixing. I was so used to playing with joycons after a year of only using them. They were very comfortable as a controller in their own right, with or without the shell. I still want to get the joycons repaired or replaced someday when I get more multiplayer games/It took me a day to acclimate to the new controller, but it already feels just as, if not more comfortable than the joycons in the joycon shell. It's heavier but not uncomfortably so, it's comfortable to grip for a few hours of gameplay. Most of the buttons have decent feedback. The battery seems to be almost as good as the joycons were, I got mine last week and still haven't had to charge it since the first day.",4,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"I was “forced” into buying my first one during the great Switch shortage of 2020. GameStop bundled a switch, game and a controller together. No switch by itself. It was actually one of the best deals seeing as amazon and eBay only had switches marked up by 2-3 times.I ended up really liking this controller. The joy cons are too small to use as an adult. My hands would cramp after a little gaming. The GF ended up taking over my switch with ACNH and this controller. So when I finally was able to get another switch.  This time through bestbuy with no bundle. I decided I needed this controller for myself again.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"Super comfortable controller, probably one of my favorites! The only gripe I have is connecting it. My SO and I each have a Switch, but purchased one of these to share. In order to pair it, you have to briefly plug it into the console you want to connect with. No easy connecting with the shoulder buttons like the Joycons have. Once it's paired though, it stays paired. Battery life is fantastic. I still rate it five stars because the pairing issue is a unique one that most people will never experience. Definitely worth the money!",5,1,2017-8-15,1,4,0
"I used to be like pretty much everyone else with controllers: Xbox 360/one/s were the gold standards. However, this is my favorite now. It feels much more solid despite how it looks.

"Is an okay controller and takes some getting used to for certain games. Not recommended for incremental movements for games that require motion detail, unless you're willing to spend extra time practicing for that specific game or unless the game has that all movement where you can physically direct the controller to position on screen. Once you know how to work it, it's okay; the joysticks are kinda stiff meaning they either go one way or the other and you can't move just right in a smooth, slow motion if you need to do it quickly like a computer mouse. Does last a long time on one charge which is a huge plus.",3,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"I was skeptical of buying this controller since I was initially thinking that buying a pair of joycons would be the better option since it supports two users instead of a fixed one user; however, after months of playing with this controller and sharing it with my friends, I found out that both products have its uses and the pro controller is outstanding on its own. I was shopping for another pair of joycons, but instead I caved in buying this item from youtube reviews and friend recommendation, but I do not regret it for a second. I've had this product for a long time now and I use it for every game I've come across coming to over 50+ games. It is comfortable with a lot of features including rumble, gryo aiming, amiibo support, and compatability with a lot of games. The quality of build is also beyond expectations as this controller has been dropped well over 10 times from friends including myself without any hardware damages or any significant cosmetic damages. Not to mention, drift concerns are not a problem here since those affected the joy cons only. I would just like to sum this up by saying that as an Console user (Xbox and Playstation), it is a great way to ease into controls in switch games and it can be a lot more reliable, comfortable, and easier to play games on the switch. (Even if you play Smash Ultimate, it can be a great substitute for a joycon (unless you are a gamecube controller loyalist that is good on its own too))",5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"I have big hands, so the Joy-Con controllers that come with the Switch are difficult for me to use (and they tend to lose sync every so often, which can interrupt games).  The Pro Controller is almost exactly the same size as an Xbox One controller and feels just as comfortable to me, the sticks and buttons are good quality, the battery life is great, and it charges quickly.  And I have not lost sync with this controller once yet.  I received a second Pro Controller as a gift, and it works just as well, giving me a lot of flexibility.The only complaint I have with this controller has less to do with the controller itself and more with how Nintendo designed some of its games to work with the Joy-Cons.  Super Mario Odyssey, for example, has a few specific moves that can only be performed on the Joy-Cons because they require the Joy-Cons to move independently, which you can't do with the Pro Controller.  Thankfully, none of these things actually make the games hard to play.",5,1,2018-11-12,1,0,0
"The Pro Controller is well worth its cost. It feels much more natural playing a game with a 'real' controller over the Joy-Cons with the grip attached. The only noticeable downside is that a few games don't support it at all, such as Super Mario Party and the Pokemon Let's Go games. Since I had exclusively been using the Joy-Cons from launch up until very recently, it took about a day to get used to the new sticks. They are stiffer to move, but are much more precise. The weight of the controller feels similar to that of an XBOX 360/ONE controller and it's very easy to transport. The charging cable can also be used for the Switch itself through a laptop or other USB outlet which is very useful. The controller also works with Windows, through Steam. Again, very good purchase that I am happy with and highly recommend.",4,1,2018-11-17,1,3,0
"I know, I know... blasphemy, right?  I am more of a traditional console gamer and I like the solid feel of the Pro controllers.  I have three Pro controllers and three sets of Joycons.  My kids and I choose the Pro controllers over the Joycons almost every time.  Not that the Joycons are bad, but I've found that I have a harder time getting them to sync and they don't feel as solid. The Pro is a nicely designed controller that really feels good in the hand.  Of course, there are certain games that only use the Joycons, but they are few.  The rest of the time our Joycons are paired together to act as full controllers anyways, so... save yourself the money and get a Pro controller.  You won't be sorry.",5,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0

"Really comfortable and battery life is great. This is way better for anyone who doesn't have tiny hands. The joy-cons are not very ergonomic and have tiny buttons. This controller sits comfortable in the hands for extended periods and the buttons are easy and comfortable to press.UPDATE: After a year of casual use the left joystick drifts downwards frequently. When I am trying to walk forwards in many games my character randomly stops in place or even walks backwards. I had some drift with the joy-cons after a couple of months, but I ignored it since I just used this controller instead after I got it. I was very happy with this controller at first, but honestly if I have to replace my controller every year it's not worth it. I'll just be getting cheap knock-offs with a similar style or moving back to Xbox or something. I never had controller problems with Xbox controllers, and I didn't even treat those nicely. It's really a shame, since apart from not doing its job it is a good controller in all other aspects. If it were reliable I would recommend this, but honestly I am embarrassed that I have recommended this to anyone in the past. You're basically buying a 1-year subscription to a functional controller. If you buy this, expect to buy a new one before too long.",2,1,2019-3-30,1,1,0

Perfect for Splatoon 2, Fortnite and even Zelda.I was unsure when I first got my Switch (at launch) if I should fork out so much extra for the Pro Controller. I'm not a hardcore gamer and thought the Joy-Cons and grip would be enough.... How wrong I was! I've been using the Pro Controller for over a month and I regret I didn't buy it sooner. It feels solid and sturdy. The triggers and buttons have much more feeling than the Joy-Cons. The button layout is very comfortable.

"It’s a really nice controller. It feels larger than the joycons with the joycon grip. The buttons on the pro controller feel higher quality and are larger than the joycons which is great for games like Splatoon 2 where the ZL and ZR buttons are used frequently. It takes a while to transition from the joycons to the pro controller if you’re used to the joycons alone, but the pro controller becomes natural to use. I just wish it wasn’t so expensive so I can buy a second pro controller for myself. Other than that, this is a great upgrade from the joycons. It has the same features from the joycons like motion controls, NFC for amiibo, snapshot for photo and video, home button, and rumble. It comes with a charger which you can plug it in to your Nintendo Switch to recharge your pro controller.

"A must-have for anyone who intends to seriously play on the Nintendo Switch for hours on end. The joy-cons are an interesting concept and are sometimes fun to use, but ergonomically speaking, they're not the greatest for long gaming sessions. That's where the Pro Controller comes in and saves the day. This is a well-made controller with pretty good haptic feedback. It fits well in the hands, and has good quality buttons and texture. The battery also lasts quite a while, and can be recharged using the included USB-A to USB-C cable, which can be attached to any USB-A port on the Switch's dock, or plugged into an appropriate USB-A wall outlet or adapter.",5,1,2018-2-19,1,2,0

An overall good tool to have on hand if you own a Nintendo Switch.For those considering buying this for Smash Ultimate: This controller is a great choice! You can go with either the Gamecube controller or pro controller for this game. I believe that the pro controller does  lose 1 frame with inputs around ~20% of the time.

"I initially bought this controller to play Zelda Breath of the Wild, MarioKart 8, and Fortnite. It was a huge improvement over using the Joy-Cons because of the great ergonomics and the freedom of motion in the analog sticks. The battery also lasts for a VERY long time. My main initial complaint at that point was that it didn't have a headset jack like Xbox and PS4 controllers have, not a huge deal. However, when I started playing Tetris99, I noticed a new flaw that became infuriating: the d-pad doesn't work well. When you push left or right, sometimes it pushes up or down too. In Tetris99, that means you're accidentally doing to do a ""hard drop"" when you intend to rotate the piece. I stopped using the pro controller with Tetris99 because I was so frustrated with it. Given the price of the controller, I would think that the d-pad would be better.",3,1,2019-3-3,1,2,0

I was shocked that I charged it once and then was able to use it all week with about an hour average per play. The battery was still strong every time that I picked this up to play some games. Extra bonus is that the power cord that comes with this controller will also charge the Switch.

I can play 3-4 game sessions of 4-5 hours each before ever getting a low battery notification, and they charge quickly. If you have not given the pro controller a shot because the price tag being almost as much as a game, I totally get it. I would much rather have a new game over a controller too!

"Feels like a quality piece of Nintendo peripheral out of the box.  Links up to the Switch with no issues, with no noticeable intermittency during use in my experience.  The Sony Dual Shock 4 has been my favorite gamepad for a long time, but I'd say this beats it out by a small margin.  The layout is great, and all the buttons and sticks feel very tactile with just the right amount of stiffness.  The rumble that we expect from Nintendo controllers is back as well, and then some.  As for the negatives, in my opinion, the cosmetic design is pretty ugly; it doesn't look like a consumer ready product, and appears more industrial.  But being a ""pro"" controller [whatever that means], maybe this was the marketing intent.  Additionally, for those Steam users out there, apparently Steam is working on native support for this gamepad, so there is some added value in that respect (hopefully Nintendo doesn't get in the way with that...you know how they are).",5,1,2018-7-11,1,2,0

"While a bit expensive, this is the nicest controller I have ever owned. The build quality is excellent, and thank goodness Nintendo didn't cheap out and put a stupid micro USB port on this controller. I am really happy I pulled the trigger on this instead of getting a cheaper alternative. While the joycon grip is ok, I think it's worth it to spend $65 to buy this. It comes with a 6 foot USB C to USB A cable so you can charge it with the switch dock. The HD rumble is awesome and so are the motion controls. It has NFC too for amibo but do people even use that feature? So there is lots of tech packed into this hardware and I believe it justifies it's price tag.",5,1,2019-9-4,1,0,0
"UPDATE: I reached out and was able to send my controller in for repairs. The controller works fine now, but I had to wait almost a month to get it back, so I bumped rating up to 4 stars. But when the controller works it is very good.Original Review:",4,1,2019-8-31,1,0,0
"As many other 1-star reviews have stated, the left stick degrades and starts to drift after a couple months of play (conveniently just outside of Nintendo's ludicrous 90 day warranty period). The running theory is that bits of plastic from the stick rub off into a white dust and then gets stuck inside, interfering with the sensors. I usually don't recommend off-brand controllers, but when you're spending twice the price on something that'll be worthless in a couple months, how can you not go with the competition instead?",1,1,2019-4-11,1,3,0
"Great controller. I opted to get this version over the black pro controller and it paid off. It was more expensive, but luckily I was able to grab it at retail price on Amazon (that one day they actually had it available) than the jacked up ones you see everywhere now.Feels very high quality, all tight, nothing loose whatsoever. I can’t imagine ever playing the Switch without this now. Only downside is the pink color, but eh...nothing wrong with a little standout color here and there.",5,1,2018-2-7,1,3,0

"The controller is great. The size and position of the buttons feels natural. It also has the capability of motion controls and amiibo support. However, the d-pad is really lacking on this controller. It's so lacking that I feel like it deducts 2 stars all on it's own. The reason the d-pad is so bad is that it will completely mess up your button presses. It's not uncommon to push left on the d-pad but have it register as up. This happens with all the directions. If Nintendo fixed the d-pad, this would be the best controller of all time.",3,1,2018-2-21,1,3,0
"I played a lot of video games growing up and held a lot of controllers throughout my life. This is a quality built controller that is very comfortable in your hand. I've held both the Xbox cotnroller nad Ps4 controller before and none felt as good as this controller. So for comfortability, this controller is a win in my book.The battery life is great and last over 30 hours according to the instruction manual.I haven't used it that long to test it out but so far, it never ran out on me. This came with a USB-c charger that can be plugged into the switch dock so it's convenience.",5,1,2019-1-26,1,0,1

"I really like these controllers. I prefer them over the Joycons. One warning is that they have a known issue. The joysticks will create dust when you use them, and this dust eventually causes drifting. Mine lasted for over a year with so many hours of gameplay I can't really complain, but I also made sure to keep the dust from getting into the controller. I have heard that some people's controllers start drifting in as little as a month. You can also choose to get metal joysticks, which are easy enough to install. This will prevent the dust issue entirely. I give this product 5 stars based on my personal experience.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"This thing is very comfortable. It feels great in my hands, is nice and weighty, and I appreciate the larger buttons. Analog sticks are bigger and longer than the joycons, which makes movement and aiming much more precise. So far, the wireless signal has been flawless, and the battery life is great (at least 30 hours).The one and only downside to this controller is the D-Pad. It's too sensitive. For example, when you press ""right"", it often activates the up or down directions as well. It makes 2D platformers a bit of a pain, and Tetris 99 is nearly impossible with this D-Pad. If it weren't for this problem, it would be a perfect controller.",4,1,2019-4-22,1,1,0
"I have had the Switch for a year now, and the whole time I have been using the Joy-Con controllers in the grip, as I was surprised with how comfortable they were, even with my fairly large hands. I got the pro controller after my girlfriend moved in with me so we could play together more comfortably rather than using one Joy-Con each.I always thought the pro controller looked meh, as if the build quality would be distinctly average, but I was definitely wrong about that. It is exceedingly comfortable, and I mean the most comfortable controller I have ever used. It is as if Nintendo just decided to make the most ergonomic and functional controller they could, and they did just that. It does not look super flashy, but it is a damn fine controller. The buttons are big and comfortable, the controller sits nicely in the hand, the triggers are designed really well so they feel great and are natural to rest your fingers on.",5,1,2018-5-11,1,1,0
"Like other users, I’ve experienced issues with the left control stick. The first instance was with stick drift. I was surprised to have this issue because of the price. Luckily, the controller was under warranty. Nintendo repaired and sent it back at no cost to me.After a few more months of use the problem has returned. When I push the stick up, it comes back. Annoying when you’re tying to make a character run forward and they start walking. Again, my controller is under warranty so I sent it to Nintendo and they’re fixing it again.",3,1,2019-8-5,1,1,0
"An absolutely comfortable controller, one of the most so from Nintendo that I've used. I have normal sized hands but cannot stand how small the joycons are even attached to the holder. Has a great weight to it, D-pad is well made especially when compared to the joycon option. I especially like the feel of the ZL,ZR buttons, they fit the contour of where your fingers would be perfectly. It's a must for a second controller if needed, but it is my go to pad for playing everything, notably Smash Bros. Ultimate where a normal sized controller is more suited for. I find the joycons to feel extremely cheaply made, also evidenced by the rubber tops coming off after only a few months. Battery life is quite good on it as well, I really have nothing bad to say about it.",5,1,2019-1-7,1,0,0
"The Switch Pro controller is an amalgamation of designs such as the Xbox 360 controller and the Dualshock 2. Having an outer ring, the analog sticks feel similar to the Dualshock 4's as well. The buttons are flat, as opposed to the convex buttons on microsoft controllers, which makes this more comfortable for me to press repeatedly. The back buttons are digital instead of triggers, which makes it more suitable to instant actions. I think this is the ideal controller for Bayonetta, and games like it.The D-Pad is outstanding given how generic in application this controller is. It is very slightly elevated in the center, meaning the hat switch is easy to rock back and forth. It doesn't hurt my thumb very much compared to a lot of previous Nintendo designs, but you may develop a callus if playing fighting games frequently.",5,1,2019-6-27,1,0,0
"My son was complaining about joy-con drift with his first generation Switch. I purchased two of these. So far, so good.They were packaged nicely and arrived quickly. Also, these are easier for adults to use versus the joy-cons, which are pretty small. They are rechargeable, which is nice (no more messing with replacement batteries and battery acid like our old wii controllers). They are also really well constructed and appear durable. Hopefully they will last a while because at $60 each, they are not inexpensive.",5,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0
"This is a very good controller. Easily tied with the Xbox 360 controller for my personal favorite. The analog sticks are excellent, responsive, but soft. This results in an extremely smooth feeling actuation, which is a common theme for this controller. All the buttons are nice and soft, but firm. Tactility is on point. The controller itself is also a good size for my large hands. USB-C is much appreciated.My one criticism is the translucent plastic used for the faceplate. I get the aesthetic they were going for, but it just reminds me of the dreadful electronic shells of the early 2000s.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"This controller was a hard sell for me at the price, but especially now that Steam has beta compatibility with this controller, this is my absolute favorite controller to use anytime I need one. The only downside is the reversed Nintendo buttons, which causes tooltips to be backwards after you change the controls to a more American layout. This doesn't seem like it would be an issue, since you don't usually look at tooltips when you know how to play a game, but it manages to have a subconscious influence that leaves me often pressing the wrong buttons for certain games. Steam also has support for the gyro controls, though I cannot vouch for the feature myself.As an aside, if you play Splatoon 2, this controller is the absolute best way to play. Very comfortable for other switch games too, even Super Mario Odyssey, which rewards playing with detached joycons.",5,1,2018-6-22,1,1,0
"This controller is the best you'll get for a switch. It feels very nice in your hand, and looks pretty decent too. I think the buttons are responsive, the sticks feel comparable to the other two big guy's controllers. I wish the console supported analog triggers but for digital triggers these are fine. I prefer the batteries be rechargeable (which these are) as long as they don't lose their ability to hold their charge anytime soon, but so far so good. I wish it were slightly cheaper, but you'll prefer this to the joy cons for sure.",5,1,2017-12-16,1,2,0

"I can't play my Switch without it. With the Switch undocked and the JoyCons locked in place it's bearable, but anytime I have my Switch docked and am using a TV I can't bear with the strange placement for the joysticks.If you're used to a DualShock controller from the PlayStation line-up then this is a MUST for you. Unless you own and constantly use a 3DS and a PS Vita you won't find the JoyCons very comfortable.",5,1,2017-8-31,1,2,0

The battery life is longer than other controllers and ergonomically fits in my hands well. Nintendo is notorious for having controllers with drift issues, I didnt believe this applied to their pro controller but it does. It WILL eventually wear down and youll have to get a new controller. Granted I put in a lot of hours, i had to dock a star for the drift.",4,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0

I have to give a two star not for this product. But for the joy-cons controller from Nintendo. The left Joy-cons are always easy to become uncontrollable after about 100h usage which is in really poor quality. I think this is the way which nintendo promotes us to buy this pro controller. Actually this pro controller has much better perfermance. But it is not easy to carry away as nintendo switch is easy-carried on game consellors. Hope nintendo can improve this problem in the furture.,2,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
The pro controller stops working after about 5-6 months of playing smash. Nintendo has really dropped the ball with their controllers on the switch. Had my mom mail me my old gamecube controllers and console. It's really ridiculous that 10+ year controllers work better than these cheaply made pieces of garbage. Don't get me started on the joy cons. Those are even worse,2,1,2020-7-22,1,1,0
"It takes a while to get used to this controller for me. I was using the joy-cons for a long time when I transitioned to this controller. I felt like the buttons were too ""gummy"" but it's actually a good thing once I got used to it. It is perfect for those long gaming sessions. It just feels better. You need to try it to understand the difference in ""feel"". I got these on sale, I think. I'm kind of a cheap-o so I probably wouldn't get these full price...yet I still use it every time I play on my switch. Go get it if you can get a decent discount. It's nintendo so I guess any discount is a decent one.",5,1,2018-3-1,1,1,0
"Bought from Amazon warehouse so the product was preopened and missing the data cable, in exchange for 10% off an already reduced price (under 50 w/tax)Appeared to be a fake at first glance (semi-transparent casing, not entirely see through like my legit pro controller), but the battery inside appeared to be the same, the buttons, sticks, and triggers worked properly, the plus and minus weren't sticking out any further, and the HD rumble was working perfectly (tested with Kirby Star Allies), and it even had the secret message under the stick (""THx2ALLGAMEFANS!)",4,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0

They will not exchange, they will just try and repair it for $30 plus shipping for each controller.  So far every controller i have bought for the switch has failed.  Nintendo can't make reliable controllers.",1,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0

"You cannot go wrong with this controller. It is the best controller to use when playing games on your Nintendo Switch on the Television. The joycons in the joycon grip is just a bit too tiny and cramped for my fingers to play games like Smash bros and Hyrule Warriors. This controller is great and extremely comfortable. I dare say its the best Nintendo controller made, next to the Gamecube Controller of course which is the best controller ever. I highly recommend buying this! It may be a bit expensive but it is a must!!",5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"I really like this controller. I found myself using my switch in dock mode a deal more than expected and ended up getting this because the joycons get uncomfortable after a while. This is a little pricey but you really are getting your money's worth. It's very well made and feels very sturdy, so do all the buttons and sticks. It also had the wireless and rumble functionality just like the joycon, something a lot of the 3rd part controllers lack.It also just feels really nice and I can play comfortably for a long time with it.

It’s got a nice heft, the rubberized grips feel good, the sticks and buttons all have very satisfying feedback, and best of all I can use it to turn on my Switch. About the only issue I have with it is that since the D-Pad is so close to the left analog stick and the - and + buttons are in a slickly different position and not raised, it’s a pretty big adjustment from using the Switch’s Joy-Cons in Breath of the Wild. I find myself having to think before and while I’m trying to use those buttons.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"The controller itself is great, no issues there.  However, I don't know at what point the USB-C cable that came included stopped working.

"One thing that held me up from playing our Switch were the terrible controllers that come with it.  For my large hands, they are impossible to use singly, and even when mounted together, the spacing is way off and strange.  With Smash Brothers Ultimate being released in December, these controllers were a necessity. They fit the hands nicely, they are well built, and I feel like I have finer control over any game I play.  Docked one star for the cost. Seriously, Nintendo?  Drop $20 off the cost and I'd give five stars.  One nice feature is that they can be charged with a common USB-C cable, meaning that we no longer have to spend money on proprietary power supplies.",4,1,2019-2-4,1,0,0
Everything about this controller is a huge improvement over the standard Joy-Cons that come with the Switch.  The controller has a nice heft to it and fits larger hands a lot better than the standard Joy-Cons.  My hands don't cramp up using this controller like they did with the other ones.  It feels very well made.The analog sticks have a better feel to them with greater resistance than the standard Joy-Con.  The buttons are larger and firmer.  The vibration feedback is improved as well.  Battery life is great too.,5,1,2019-7-26,1,0,0

Also the chip reader is not sensitive and can really struggle to read amiibos.

"Performs at least as well as the joycons in every way. More comfortable than the joycon mold thing. Face buttons feel good, not my favorite but at least as good as joycons' buttons for most purposes. R/L and ZR/ZL feel extremely smooth, the best bumper and triggers of any controller imo. The joysticks are the smoothest I've ever used, like butter. The sensor doesn't seem to function any differently from the joycon's, but most people seem to prefer aiming in Splatoon with this and I agree. It might just be that the sensor is coming from the center rather than the right joycon. Could also just be the familiarity of holding a more traditional controller making the gyro aiming feel more natural. Either way, I prefer it.",5,1,2018-11-28,1,2,0

Reason being that the point where the analogue stick makes contact with the edges of the controller cause some serious abrasion. This has happened to both my pro controllers, and gives the analogue stick endpoints a slight grindy-ness for lack of a better term.

This one, though, is the least awkward and most usable for me.",4,1,2018-3-25,1,1,0
"This is a really well built controller! I'll get right to the point about what I enjoy about this:* joysticks play really nicely, very smooth and accurate",4,1,2019-8-17,1,0,0
"One of the most comfortable controllers I have ever used. It's size is roughly akin to that of an xbox one controller, but without the grooves, which works in its favor. I love the bigger size of the face buttons (XYAB), which i was originally skeptical about. It makes moving your thumb from the right stick very easy and fluid. The actual d-pad is a massive improvement over the joy-con controllers. The bumpers and triggers (L R and ZL ZR) are more or less 1:1 with the joy-cons. It did take me a small amount of time to get used to the position of the +. -, home and share buttons, but it hardly drew away from the overall controller experience. Additionally, you can use this controller for PC gaming via bluetooth if your computer supports it or a micro-usb cable, though you will need the proper drivers (which can be easily found online.).",5,1,2018-5-24,1,1,0

"I was hesitant to get the pro controller since I have (2) Joy-con. I got to say this is one of the best controllers I ever owned, I would say is even better than the XBOX One controller. The size, grip weight, standard vibration plus accelerometer its all in one package. But surpassingly one of the things I love must is the buttons and analog joy sticks, they feel right, and right size. You need to have one of these to understand, its like playing with nintendo buttons quality (NES/SNES) but in a pro version.",5,1,2018-7-31,1,1,0
"I love this controller. The weight is good, controls are good, etc., but no matter what, the portion your hand actually grips, is always sticky. It's weird and it's because the grip portion is not made of the same material as the rest of it, and whatever they used is purposely sticky as in it makes you feel like your hands are dirty and sweaty even when they're dry and powdered. Not worth the money to be this uncomfortable.",2,1,2019-3-1,1,1,0

"Although I think the portable on the go table is cool, I'll always prefer a standard in hand controller. I've played Zelda BOTW, Mario Odyssey, and Bayonetta with this controller and it's fantastic. Feels great in the hand, buttons have just the right amount of clicky-ness, not to mention one of the longest battery lives I have ever seen on a controller. I've gone days, if not weeks, completely forgetting I even had to charge this thing at all. Other then the price if you own a switch and plan on playing a lot, this is a must. If you can find it on sale, even better.",5,1,2018-8-10,1,2,0
"Let me start by saying that this is a great controller!  The fit, the feel, the overall quality...they're all top-notch!  But you know that a LARGE company like NINTENDO could do well by pricing their controllers somewhere closer in price to what the little, unknown companies can, even with the superior craftsmanship taken into account.  Either way, Nintendo has us coming and going and that's just all there is to it!",5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"I found the undersize joy con controllers to be a bit small for my big hands.  So using the Switch Pro Controller took care of that issue easily. The controller itself is solidly built and holds a charge for a super long time. It feels good with all the controls in the right spot.  Bottom line: This controller is an amazing piece of hardware of superb quality and fantastic tactile feedback. It is, however, simply too expensive, hence 4 stars vice 5.",4,1,2017-12-28,1,2,0
"This is a great controller! I've noticed it's much easier on your hands then joy con controllers. I don't know about quality yet, but we have had bad luck with our joy con controllers. The joy cons we have purchased seem very low quality. The knobs are glitchy and get stuck in forward and they do not want to connect with the switch sometimes. This controller seems to be working great so far. I will update if anything changes, though.",5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"I was tired of taking the joy cons on and off to play games on my TV when the Switch is docked. This wireless controller is perfect for having a ""normal"" game experience with your Switch! The controller reminds me of an Xbox controller, so it wasn't hard to work it.You charge the controller through a USB cord you can connect to your Switch dock. The charge last a long time on the controller, at least for me it hasn't ran out yet haha! But I also replug it often so maybe that's why.",5,1,2019-1-29,1,0,1
"This controller is pretty good for people wanting an improvement over the Joy-Cons that come with the console. It has almost all of the features the Joy-Cons had (there's no IR sensor), it feels pretty good (doesn't feel cheap at all!), and it has a great battery life. Compared to the Switch's included Joy-Cons, this controller is larger and has a directional pad. Overall, it's a very fantastic controller.However, if you're buying more than one, the price adds up rather dramatically, as they cost $60-$70 each. If you want a cheaper (but still great) alternative, PowerA makes Nintendo-certified USB controllers for under half the price, though these do lack motion control and rumble.",5,1,2018-5-12,1,1,0
"Garbage. This has turned me off of the Switch. I bought a Nintendo Switch Pro controller when I originally got my Nintendo Switch. It stopped working within a few months. I thought, okay, maybe I got a shitty controller, it happens. So I buy this one as a replacement on Amazon and it stopped working already! Why can't I get a replacement???? Another trash product from a once great entertainment company. I'm done.",1,1,2019-12-15,1,1,0
"Let's just say that controllers won't be more comfortable than this. It fits right in my hand, and I have the most average hands on earth. I don't have to worry about holding it when gaming, as if the grips were doing the gripping, so I could focus all of my attention to what was happening on screen. I did hope for a little bit more battery life from it, but I guess I'm a bit jaded, since the rivaling consoles' controllers can't hold a life to the switch controller's battery life.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
I've been using the joycons until they drifted. I know nintendo can fix but I don't want something that'll just break in a month after using it so I bought the pro controller.I don't know why it took me so long. I love the weight and the feel in my hands 10000x better than the janky little joycons (even in their holder). 400hrs later and still no drifting so I'm sold. If I had to buy it again I would.,5,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
"I was very surprised that the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller was usable wireless on PC, but once I figured that out it became my primary controller for everything. As an avid PC and console gamer I've used dozens of controllers over the years but have never had one that felt so natural one first picked up. The gyroscopes are an interesting feature and the button placement leads to easy combos. The battery life is fantastic and the sticks move smoothly.",5,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"I was hesitant to buy this controller at first because of the high price compared to 3rd party models. But after receiving it I can understand why.  This is a solid controller.  It weighs more than the joy-cons with the adapter which I was surprised about at first.  But then was immediately comfortable with it and appreciated the weight.  It feels great in the hand, controls are where they should be and you can turn off and on the Switch with it.  Battery life lasts forever, and has rumble features built in.  Something which at first I didn't think I'd need but really enjoy.  Its like the Wavebird was for the GCN.  Completely necessary for most games like Zelda, Warframe, Doom.",5,1,2018-12-26,1,0,0

"I needed a controller as an alternative to my Joy Cons, as I have issues playing certain games with the tiny Joy Cons. The Pro Controller is a great controller, the buttons are big and responsive, it is very easy to connect to other Switch systems, and it's wireless so I can play in any comfortable position. Its battery life is half of most wireless controller from other systems, but I don't personally find it as an issue (you can just connect it though its usb cable and charge it while you play).  A must-have controller if you like to play various games with a standard controller layout or multiplayer titles.",5,1,2019-1-1,1,0,0
"The Wii U Pro controller was trash. This controller had me worried. Now I DO NOT WANT TO GAME WITH OUT IT! I love this controller and I think it rivals the PS4 Sony Controller. I love the PS4 and I've always loved PlayStation controllers, not thinking they could get any better I was wrong, the PS4 controller was revolutionary, but this Switch Pro Controller is a must! Fits into my Switch dedicated bag I bought here on Amazon too, I wrote a review on it explaining everything I can fit into that bag.",5,1,2018-6-27,1,1,0
"If you want to play some serious Zelda, I recommend having this in your hands.  Going into battle with this controller really makes a difference on button control and performance.The only thing that can get irritating is that once in a while during a serious battle, you go into the scope mode.  The joysticks push-down features are pretty easy to engage.",5,1,2018-9-6,1,2,0
"This controller is awesome. Is rechargeable and connects to my switch every-time. I got a lot of game play before I had to recharge the controller. A message will flash on your screen to let you know when it is near end of battery life. The controller is very comfortable to hold and I like it much better than just using the joy-cons by themselves. I know the price could be lower but don't second guess it, it is worth the price and will last for years to come.",5,1,2017-11-29,1,2,0
"As much as I love the joy-cons on the Nintendo Switch I still wanted a conventional controller for playing in docked mode. I was hesitant to dish out the money for a controller that costs the same if not more as a game but took the leap after reading more about it. Do you absolutely have to buy this controller to have an enjoyable experience? No. However, as many have stated you are paying for a quality product that is not only built well but also extremely comfortable! The battery of the controller will last you a very long time. I myself typically don't play more than 2-5 hours at a time due to my hectic schedule but I rarely charge it and I have yet to drain it's battery entirely. If you're on the fence like I was just know that you won't be disappointed with the purchase. A huge thumbs up!",5,1,2018-7-9,1,1,0
"Great looking controller with a nice heavy feel to it that makes it feel more durable in your hands. I didn't find the controller too heavy even after playing with it for hours. There was an adjustment period going from the Joy-Cons to the Pro controller but nothing an hour with the controller wouldn't fix. My only complaint is that the ""+"" and ""-"" buttons are square and feel like the home and share button. I wish they went with the design similar to the joy cons where the buttons were actually shaped like a + and -. All and all, a great controller if you are spending hours upon hours on games like Zelda BotW",5,1,2017-3-7,1,1,0

"It worked like a charm for the few days I actually got to use it. The left analog started to drift (sound familiar?) to the left making mariokart impossible. Come on Nintendo. I’ve heard this hundreds and hundreds of times, it’s obviously a problem. How about you fix this please. I can not recommend this controller especially at the price.lesson learned so you don’t have to.",1,1,2019-4-9,1,2,0
"I believe this is an essential to any Switch gamer that spends a lot of time with the console docked. It increases the ease of control that’s otherwise hindering with the small joy cons, and it lets the joy cons charge for later portable use. I find it especially useful for Mario tennis aces, or any game where the right control stick is used. I find myself accidentally bumping it and messing up my game on the joy cons. My only gripe is that the control sticks have a type of rim around them that hurts if you play hard like me. (I actually got a blister on my thumb after only a few hours of play.) Note: I also have a blue cover on my controller and a control stick cover to alleviate the aforementioned issue, and it seems to have worked.",4,1,2018-8-2,1,2,1
"Best Switch Controller, hands down. Pricey, but worth it. Was glad to grab a second one on sale from Amazon because tired of fighting my wife for just the one.  These things rock compared to the cheap feel of the joy cons.",5,1,2020-7-23,1,1,0

"When you take the NFC, accelerometer, and vibration into account this controller is a steal. However I wish nintendo made a cheaper version without the NFC for the other 3 controllers I would buy for multiplayer. Amibbos are cool but most games don't use them and if I don't own any why would I buy hardware to support them?The accelerometer is amazing in BoTW.

"This is a must have if you have a Switch. The controller feels way better than those puny Joycons. It's got a good weight to it and very good quality controller. If you play Splatoon you gotta get this or you cant paint as effectively, resulting in losing all the time. The NFC scanning works great and fast too. Just touch the Amiibo to the center of the controller and it will work some magic.",5,1,2017-10-20,1,2,0
"It's going to take some time to get used to the weight and shoulder buttons on this compared to the Joy Con. The buttons have softer feedback than the very mechanical feeling Joy Cons, and I'm not sure which I prefer. Pairing was quick and painless, very ergonomic, all the added functions, such as motion controls and amiibo reader are all present (I haven't had a good chance to tell if the HD rumble is present, or just a more basic rumble feature). If the battery life is as good on this as it was the Wii U's Pro Controller, then It'll be half a year before I have to give it it's first charge.",5,1,2018-1-4,1,2,0
This controller is very durable and most importantly comfortable! This is tied with the steam controller for my favorite. It's joysticks have a smooth responsive feel with a great shape and textured grip. The handles feel good even after long play sessions and the buttons have a superior feel and click without being loud like the joy-cons.,5,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"The controller is really comfortable. It looked like it would be clunky like an Xbox controller from the pictures, so I was relunctant to buy it at first. I prefer the PS style controller. Someone told me it actually felt different from other controllers. I decided to buy it and I was very happy. I've only played Splatoon with it so far, but it's a lot easier to handle that using the joy con grip that comes with the system.",5,1,2017-7-27,1,2,0
"This is right up there, right above the xbox one controller as the most comfortable ever for me. The triggers have a much nicer pull and click feel to me, though they're more linear than the xbox one. The buttons are all wonderful to feel and the control sticks have a great rubber that offers grip but with no additional texture. It's a bit expensive though, possibly because of the amiibo reader which i think is unnecessary, but if you can get this controller, it's wonderful for the switch. Battery lasts quite a long while and can be used wired if needed",5,1,2019-1-10,1,0,0
"I love this controller, the quality and the battery duration is great. This is a much better option overall than the joy cons.

"As soon as I held the controller in my hands, I could feel the great build quality of it. All buttons feel great and are highly responsive. The analog sticks feel incredibly smooth. Motion controls are responsive. The HD rumble feels nice on the controller.

"Be careful when you buy a used one for those who want to go cheaper. I bought a ""Like New"" one, and it came out of the box barely looking acceptable. The overall quality of the controller was very poor, having scratches and tears everywhere. I tried to overlook that and tried to play it on the switch. Sadly, the right analog stick won't even work. I tried to calibrate it but no success. I'm not sure whether to be upset for the company lying about the status of the controller, or how over-priced these controllers are, leading me to end up wanting to buy a used one.",1,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0

"At first, I was a little hesitant to buy the Pro Controller (price, obviously) for my Switch, but I caved and bought it from Amazon anyway. Once I received it, holy cow, I was impressed! The buttons, joysticks, and motions are very responsive. The vibrations from the HD rumble is really detailed, unlike anything I've experienced from my past controllers. The battery lasts a long time, I was playing Mario Kart 8 and Odyssey for a few hours every day for a few weeks before I finally had to recharge it. I cannot give you my answer on the NFC touchpoint, because I don't own an Amiibo, yet. The only issue I have is that Nintendo should make the home and capture buttons stand out a little more, so I don't have to keep looking down at my controller when my thumb couldn't find one of them.If you're looking to buy a regular controller for your Switch, I recommend getting the Pro Controller!",5,1,2018-11-29,1,1,0
"the second I put my hands on it and started using it, it felt amazing. It feels very premium, the buttons, and texture are all very nice to press. I don’t usually obsess over details like that with controllers or devices, like the PS4 controllers feel ok, and the xbox controllers feel ok, but this somehow blew my expectations. Long battery life too. And it’s charged fully right out of the gate.I got this controller because my joycons has drifting issues. For the time being, I’m just gonna put this in a plastic ziploc when I’m not using it. Probably shouldn’t have food all over your hands when you play or leave it in dusty areas.",5,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0

This thing is a back saver. I have been playing with my child lately and I hate doing so with those tiny controls. They work fine for kids but for an adult you basically have to fold yourself in half to use one. If you're playing for any longer than 30 minutes your back will be screaming at you. The 40 hour battery life is amazing. This just makes the time I can play with my child that much more enjoyable.,5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"In my opinion, despite its relatively high price for a controller, it's the definitive way to enjoy your Switch on a TV or monitor. For people with big hands, you'll be able to play it perfectly fine and comfortably versus with the awkward positioning of the normal Switch Joycons. This controller is also very rugged, has a reliable battery life, and good connection distance.",4,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"Even my tiny lady hands can't take using the Joy-Cons on the straps or on the small controller included with the console for long periods of time without cramping up. 8 hour sessions of Zelda or Xenoblade would get to be pretty brutal without the pro controller. The long battery life is splendid and it feels amazing to not have to stop playing on one of my few free days for a while so my controller charges because I can literally play all damn day without needing to hook up the usb. It's super comfortable, has a nice weight to it, and I love the d-pad on this (all the buttons feel good, but the dpad gets a special mention). It kind of reminds me of the Xbone d-pad, it's quite satisfying and I have a feeling it'd lend itself very well to any future fighters the Switch might get. And yes, it has the fancy rumble just like the joy-cons do and it feels just as nice here.I initially didn't see the need in a separate controller for my Switch, but after my left joy-con started getting the desync issue I finally caved and ordered one. Nintendo was likely to wipe my Switch during the repair and I was not too thrilled at the idea of buying a whole new set of joy-cons. I figured if the left one worked great still attached to the screen when I played it portable, why not just leave the joycons attached 24/7 and just get the Pro and never worry about syncing issues again. I'm very glad that I did because this makes long gaming sessions 10x better.",5,1,2018-1-17,1,6,0
"The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is, putting it conservatively, Nintendo's best controller yet in terms of functionality and comfort. Its understated clear/black finish belies its immensely satisfying buttons, sticks, and D-pad; additionally, button placement feels extremely natural, and the impeccable build quality will ensure that this controller will stand up to many long gaming sessions. Even with motion control, an NFC sensor, and HD Rumble, it lasts an amazing 40 hours on a single charge - half of what the Wii U Pro Controller did, but still more than the DualShock 4 and the Xbox One controller combined. The Pro Controller also works natively on Windows PCs via USB or Bluetooth, and is even compatible with Steam if the user participates in the Steam Client Beta. My only real gripe is that the HD Rumble in this controller isn't quite as pronounced as that in the Joy-Cons, but I chalk that up to the function having to travel through denser plastics, so it's really more of a nitpick than anything. If you have a Switch and want to graduate from the Joy-Con Grip, there is no reason not to own this controller - it earns its keep and then some.",5,1,2018-12-13,1,0,0
"This is a perfect controller if you're planning on long gaming sessions, or if you want to play shooters and more fast-paced games. The sticks are easier to manipulate than on the joycons, giving you better control, and the whole thing feels a bit more comfortable than just holding the two small halves.That said, if you don't feel like you need finer control for your games, the only real benefit over the joycons is battery life. As long as you don't mind putting the controllers back on the Switch after each play session, that's not a huge issue.",5,1,2018-1-5,1,1,0
"I'm one of those people that rarely has time to game on the go. My Switch will be used at home, connected to my tv, 99% of the time. I found the included Joycon controller, to be a little small for my hands, so i bought the Pro. Right off the bat, you notice how much more comfortable it is to hold for extended periods of time, over the joycons. The inclusion of a proper D-Pad, is also a plus, as i found the 4 buttons on the joycon that act as the D-Pad, just felt weird, when i tried to use what should've been a D-Pad. The buttons and thumbsticks, just seem to react better overall. The battery life of the Pro, is really long. Somewhere around 40 hours, off of 1 charge. I only own Zelda BOTW so far, so i can't comment on the rumble feature, as Zelda barely uses it, and i also can't comment on the built in Amiibo scanner, as i have yet to use it, since i don't have any Amiibo. In the end, if you game mostly at home like myself, definitely get yourself the Pro controller, for extended periods of play.",5,1,2017-5-14,1,0,0
"I bought this as a bundle with Zelda. Saved a few bucks but just be cautious with the first gen pro controllers because they have an inaccurate dpad. Check online for the newer model serial number.

If you can't live with the dpad being perfect, I suggest going out your way to finding the newer model. If MSRP is already 70 and taking this for 50, that's ok for me but this is a licensed Nintendo's ,""Pro Controller"" ; knowing this should be a quality product.

If you primarily play your Nintendo Switch on TV, I highly recommend getting the Pro Controller.",5,1,2018-4-27,1,2,0
"Feels completely different from the Joycons. Stronger joysticks, buttons, and triggers. Feels like far more is put into controller feel than anything else. Battery lasts pretty long.

"Far too breakable. Received this ~2 weeks ago and from 1 or 2 drops at barely any height the left handle is now flimsy and controller is nearly broken.

This controller is amazing. It feels so good in your hands. The battery life on this controller is insane compared to the PS4 controller. This controller lasts like 20+hours of game play on a single charge. One of the reasons why it's so good is because it does not have an annoying big bright light in the back of it to lower the battery charge as quickly *cough* PS4 *cough*....If you want of a more classical feel controller then get this for your Switch.

It's so much more comfortable in my hand than the joycon is I feel more freedom of movement I have long fingers and when I use the joy con I can almost completely wrap my hand all the way around it and touch my wrist the Pro controller I don't have that problem save up your money and get one you won't be disappointed yeah it's a little on the expensive side but even if you can go to Etsy you can get a 3D printed holder so that you can mount your switch screen on top of the controller.

I prefer using this over the standard Joycons that come with the Switch. Those are a little too small and unwieldy for my taste. This controller uses a solid design that mimics the Xbox 360. They claim that you will get up to 40 hours of play time from a single charge which I believe since I have never been close to draining it yet.My only real con is the price. I don't know why these need to retail for $70. I think $50 would be a more realistic but I won't fault the controller itself based on the price. Obviously people (myself included) are buying them for this price...,5,1,2017-12-6,1,1,0
I like buying official Nintendo brand on things. The battery lasts a really long time. Since buying I still haven’t charged it. It does come with a charging wire just plugs into a USB port.  The hand grip is very comfortable for long game time. I am enjoying playing my switch games in a different more comfortable way. I do wish they had different colors to choose from like the joy cons.,5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"D-pad aside, this is the most slick controller ive held in a long time. It's dinput compatible, so it will work with your PC. It also works natively with the steamlink now.Unfortunately, the charge port is only for charging. Most Android flavours have difficulty with it, it will work fine at first but then lag. probably a polling issue. This is almost a non issue aside from a few games that benefit.",5,1,2018-9-4,1,1,0
Pro Controller is the one to beat. I used to really think the best Nintendo Controller was the GameCube Controller. Well after I bought this one I have my doubts. The grip and the buttons are all solid. The battery last a long time I rarely have to charge it and I would play Zelda BOTW daily. For an adult or just someone with bigger hands I think this is the best way to go rather than using the joy con's as a single controller. I would recommend at least getting one pro controller for your switch.,5,1,2018-11-15,1,1,0
Not even 15 seconds after I set up the controller did I notice my character start to wander in a downward motion when my thumb wasn’t on the joystick.Update,4,1,2020-3-31,1,1,0
If you own a Switch this is a MUST HAVE. It is the most comfortable controller I have ever held Nintendo did their home work here think Gamecube controller but even more comfortable. I can't say enough about this just get it.,5,1,2017-12-28,1,4,0

"The feel and durability of the Pro Controller is way better than Joy Cons, and is a must have for playing on the TV. However, after about ~800 hrs of smash and other games, my left joy stick began to drift/picking up bad responses. Sad, because it is an incredibly comfortable controller and I like it way more than the GC controller for Smash.Still better durability than the Joy Cons, but not up to Nintendo's standards as far as older gen controllers (GC controller)",4,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0

"Waste of money. After a few months of light use, remote toggles go nuts while you’re playing the game. All the sudden they stop working, and you’re spinning all over the screen. Interesting that this product only has a 3 month warranty, hmm, sounds like they don’t even expect them to last and are too cheap to replace them for customers.",1,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"We tried an off-brand pro controller at first, to save a few bucks, but received a defective item - lesson learned. Bought the ""real"" Nintendo branded one, and it's going strong. Seems pretty well made to me (moreso than the joycons that came with the switch - two years with the switch, and I've already replaced the joysticks in the joycons), and the kids like it - although now they fight over who gets to use it, so... you've been warned! :-)",5,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0
"The ergonomics of this controller are some of the best I've ever had for a controller in my life.But the D-pad is nearly worthless. It will randomly trigger the wrong direction, or even trigger other buttons (the L-button in particular). This makes a lot of games unplayable, like Crypt of the Necrodancer or Cadence of Hyrule.",1,1,2020-3-2,1,1,0
"Been gaming all my life, I go through controllers like you wouldn't believe. This is the nicest controller i've ever used on any system. Comfortable design, smooth joysticks, responsive buttons. I just wish I could use this on my PC and playstation. My only complaint is that just like the charger on the switch, it can only be a NINTENDO usb charger. Why the hell make a UNIVERSAL-serial-bus plug that's...not universal?",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"Excellent controller. I was forced to buy a new controller once the controllers that came with the Switch started ‘drifting’. Once I realized what was happening I started researching new controllers. This one is one of the more expensive models out there, but I wanted to buy a quality controller and not a cheap piece of plastic which is what most after market brands seem to be. I’ve had this for a few months now and no issues. The button layout is similar but slightly different than the stock controllers, it doesn’t take long to get used to, but it is noticeable at first.",5,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"It is as I presumed the same pro controller, plus some color. However, the purple looks brighter in the stock photo, it is actually darker and 'burgundy' .",5,1,2017-12-3,1,6,0
"To those of you who have experienced the dreaded joy con drift like me, this is the perfect substitute. I read a suggestion to get the pro controller rather than a new pair of joy cons as it'd be more of a risk of having the same problem. 2 weeks in and no problems. Works well with my fast paced rhythm games and shooters.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,1,0
"The answer is: yes.Super easy to connect. The feel is very nice and I have noticed that my hands don’t cramp from holding it too long. Joysticks and buttons all feel great to use and somewhat reachable. Definitely, might need to practice some new skills with your fingers in speed and positioning.",5,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0
"I noticed the rubber isn't as thick on the switch as the pro controller has. In terms of durability, I'd recommend this over the stock ones that come with the switch. After the first hundred hours, the rubber on the OEM controllers lose their grip alot faster than the pro controller does at the same amount of time. Plus if you have big hands and are a child at heart like me, you'll enjoy the ergonomics Nintendo put into in designing this controller. I like it better than the Xbox One/X controller inuse for my PC.",5,1,2018-2-26,1,1,0
"The controller arrived almost 3 days quicker than anticipated.  Not only that but for a Used Like New it was practically a new controller never opened complete with plastic film over the front display.  I really lucked out getting this considering I have been camping for near a year for the price to drop under $90 thanks to scalpers.The controller itself is very solid and being a Xenoblade fan, I can see myself using this for years to come.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"Very ergonomic controller that works incredibly well with the Nintendo Switch! It's great for use at home when your switch is docked or you can take it with you on the go if you have room for it. For any long duration of play, I would 100% recommend using this controller to avoid discomfort from holding the joy-cons for too long.Highly recommend for any serious Switch gamers!",5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"I've used 3rd party ones that haven't worked well, and I've used 3rd party ones that I like better than this.  But this one is still very good.  Connected easily, and the weight of it is nice.  What I don't like is that it seems to have a dead battery every time I go to use it.  I think It is constantly trying to connect even when it isn't in your hands.  It needs to have an off switch or something.",4,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"I’m so disappointed with this. It is ridiculous to spend around 70 dollars to buy it, you can buy everywhere cheaper than it. The box came and it broken a little, the surface of controller seems used, it do have some flaws.",2,1,2019-5-13,1,2,0
"So I was lucky enough to pre-order the Nintendo Switch upon initial announcement. I instantly fell in love with it. Loved the versatility of the ""pick up and go"" concept, the detachment of the controllers to create the Joy Con Grip, the games! I never thought the Pro Controller was necessary because I had everything I needed with the stock Nintendo Switch equipment...I was wrong. The Pro Controller feels great, works amazing, no lag. I wish I would've bought it sooner. Absolute must buy if you have a Switch.",5,1,2018-8-31,1,1,0
Didnt Nintendo basically set the standard for D-pads with the NES?Well this one is terrible! Avoid If you want to play any games that require a precise d-pad.,1,1,2019-3-9,1,2,0
"100% necessary if you want to enjoy playing with others on the Switch. The small little joycons are great if you're 5yrs old and have tiny muskrat hands, but my 9yr old even found the joycons too tiny and prefers the Pro controller.

"The controller itself is great! But my son went to go charge it for the first time yesterday and the charger is wrong! It doesn't fit the controller!

Moral of the story: Check EVERYTHING when you get it!",3,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
"This is easily the most comfortable traditional style controller I have tried. But unfortunately it had to go back. I only tried to use it once and the drift was constant, as bad as the worst joycon drift. It made it unplayable. You could not stay still. It seemed like it was packaged weird so maybe it had been returned before.",3,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"Build quality and comfort is very good. Not sure I would put the controller above the Xbox One or the PS4, but easily the best Nintendo controller ever made IMO. The sicks are sensitive and very accurate. The buttons are a pleasure to press without the numbing feeling you can get from some of the rounded hard plastic buttons. Price is a little high, so have held my purchase to just one of these. Wish they were less, so I could sport a pair, but they aren't so I wont :(.",5,1,2018-2-18,1,1,0
"Love this thing. Thought I was fine with just the joy cons in the joy con grip but boy howdy was I wrong. This was well worth it for me but I'd recommend the regular version to anyone looking to save a few bucks and get a very similar experience.To anyone curious, this specific version of the pro controller (Xenoblade) has a (possibly intentional) manufacturing difference in the D-pad. The pivot point is slightly longer, allowing for slightly tighter and precise controls, most relevant for fighting games. Its only noticable if you're looking for it.",5,1,2018-12-5,1,0,0
"After going through multiple controllers for the switch, I noticed the 3rd party controller analogs are usually very inaccurate. The joy cons on the other hand are accurate with the analog aiming, yet they were very short and a little too fast for my liking...This controller is exactly what I expected! higher analog and SUPER accurate aiming adjustments. feels similar to the xbox family, just slightly wider. The icing on the cake for me was the fact that the home button boots the console (3rd party controllers dont do this), i love this controller!",5,1,2020-8-2,1,0,1
"The controller is my favorite to use across my switch and PC. The price may be a bit expensive, but the fact it is rechargeable and runs for around 50 hrs on a single charge is well worth it in my opinion. The controller has a good weight and feel that I can play for hours whether it be rocket league, or an adventure game such as Zelda: BoTW. Steam works well with it either hard wired connected or via Bluetooth, allowing you to customize every button to be what you wish.It connects and charges via the same usb-c the switch charges with, and includes a usb -> usb-c cable if you would want to charge it off of the switch dock as well.",5,1,2018-8-1,1,1,0
"As many other reviewers stated, the left control stick got very loose in less than a week. We can’t play Mario Kart with it because it’s too hard to control the car. I do like the way the controller feels while playing, but it’s worthless when maneuvering your car or person. Really disappointing. We already got rid of the box, so I guess we wasted a bunch of money.",2,1,2019-1-1,1,1,0
"My family fights over this controller, because we all believe that it's sleek black color reflect the darkness of our souls!  We also like that it is harder to see what each of the buttons are.  Seems a little less bossy than your average ""more clearly labeled"" controller.  My family would probably be driven to a physical altercation should you remove all decalling completely!  This is a pro controller!  If you don't know what the buttons have been for the last ten years, then you could get a beginner controller!",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"I really wasn't expecting much out of nintendo but it's probably my favorite controller to use. It's great to lean back and play like a normal controller. I love my joy cons to death but every so often you just want something that fits your hand a little better. Also, when playing smash bros ultimate, ""tilts"" are sooo much easier to pull off with these joysticks versus the joycons. If you're struggling with tilts, this is the way to go controller wise. Though if you want a controller ""purely"" for smash, maybe the gamecube controller is better. But this is preferable to me as it works with almost every game! The only games it won't work with are games that demand half a joycon like super mario party.",5,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0
"This is the official brand pro controller for the Nintendo Switch. In layout, it is very similar to an Xbox 360/One controller, with the exception of the ABXY buttons being changed around a bit. Ergonomically, it is very comfortable to hold, which is surprising since I have very small hands. However, the comfort of a controller is very subjective, so the only real way you will know is if you hold one for yourself. The controller is very easy to connect to the Nintendo Switch console or a PC and has a great wireless range. The controller includes a lithium-ion battery that has a killer battery life of 40 hours, which is so long that sometimes I forget I even have to charge this thing and get shocked when a low battery warning shows up on the screen. The $70 MSRP of the controller seems very steep, but for the comfort, battery life, gyro, and NFC reader, it is worthwhile if you play your Switch a lot. Since it's $50 rn, I would recommend it even more.",5,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0
"D-pad aside, this controller is great for most games on the Switch. It's most used while docked on my TV, and for an extra controller during local multiplayer.However the majority of my Switch use is in handheld mode. So I don't use this controller a whole lot.",4,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0
"If you have a switch, you need this controller. I waited for a few months after I got my switch to purchase, mainly due to no stock available. But man I am so glad I got it, it just feels perfect. Don’t let the price turn you away, the battery life is extremely good, I play my switch a lot and charge it once every 3-4 weeks, compared to my ps4s once every 2 days. It has the motion controls, rumble, amiibo reader. USB c charging cable is a nice touch too.",5,1,2017-10-9,1,2,0
"I've used things like Scuffs, the Xbox Elite controller, etc, so my standards are pretty high. I'd gotten so used to the Joycons and clawing while I was waiting for this. It's... alright. Pretty standard controller, nothing outstanding. No bells and whistles, no paddles, no button remapping. Doesn't offer anything the joycons don't outside of ergonomics and a standardized form-factor. I'd love to see if Scuff eventually releases a switch controller.",4,1,2018-1-1,1,2,0
"After I got home and unboxed my Switch, I realized that I should've bought two of these pro controllers.  The joycons are great - don't get me wrong - but for some games, it's just nicer to have a full-sized controller. These controllers are great quality and have a very long battery life. In fact, I've owned them for awhile now and still haven't had to charge them. In addition, I like how they are USB C and not mini or micro USB.",5,1,2019-8-28,1,0,0
"*UPDATE*After a day with the controller, I decided to call Nintendo's customer support. They ran me through the typical home diagnostics (update system/controllers, perform ""input test"") and then recommended I send in the controller for repair. So I sent it in.",4,1,2018-5-20,1,5,0
"It’s a little pricey but I like the pro controller. Much like the Xbox 360 controller which really impressed everyone. So far it’s been very durable and the battery lasts a long time. Just be warned it seems the controller will calibrate itself when you first connect to the console. When I did this I accidentally had the joystick held up a bit so it seemed like the joystick was drifting in game. Had to re-pair the controller to fix it. After that no problems, works great.",5,1,2018-12-29,1,0,0
"Yep, just like you'd expect it, it's an official switch pro controller. It's a shame the Xenoblade version is so expensive along with the other special edition pro controllers, but this one in particular is awesome.

If you don't mind spending a bit of money for a pro controller, this is it!",5,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"I love my Pro controller, so when the joysticks were going bad and I needed to replace it, I wasn't willing to switch to any of the other gamepads. While I could have torn it apart and replaced the joysticks, I figured it was time to get a second one anyway, and pulled the trigger on this one. I'll fix the first one later, in the meantime, I still have my favorite controller on hand. Zero complaints (except, perhaps, inability to hold up to a year of gaming before needing new joysticks).",5,1,2019-7-12,1,0,0
"The best console controller I've ever used. Perfect weight, large face buttons, precise D-pad, and a comfortable grip for American hands. It feels like it is built to last. Yes, it is expensive.

"I was reluctant to spend 65 bucks on this thing, but when the price dropped to 60 I decided to just bite the bullet. My main beef with the joy-con is the small buttons, but the Pro controller has comparatively huge buttons and I find it to be much more comfortable and ergonomic overall. The thing that really impressed me, though, was the sturdiness of the construction and the texture of the parts. In short, this controller FEELS like it costs 60 dollars. This is simply a must-have item.",5,1,2018-5-12,1,1,0
"Excellent controller. It feels very natural to hold and is so much better than using the Switch's controllers as single unit.Some games dont really feel right with it however. This isnt a fault of the controller however, it's just some games use a lot of motion control and the separate controllers are much better for those games. You can use it for motion control stuff though if you like.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"Great controller. I never had an issue with the joy con controllers but i figured since i play a lot at home with the switch docked that i should get this controller. I don't get the complaints about price. Xbox has just about any color or themed controller for about the same price and in my opinion this controller is just better. I actually ended up buying 2 just to have one as a backup and also for Mario Kart. The charge lasts a really long time, never have issues connecting to the Switch, its just an all around great controller, you wont be dissapointed.",5,1,2018-6-13,1,0,0
"Really happy with this purchase even with the higher cost. Was waiting on getting this  controller for a few months. Feels incredible to hold, the construction is solid, one of my favorite parts is that the grips are textured not the same flat colored plastic as the back, also the d-pad is the improved version and works properly.The design is something special with the colors and clashing pyra stripe with the sword. Realistically the color is pink not red if anyone is wondering.",5,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0
"This is the perfect controller for playing Switch games on a big TV. It's definitely the most traditional, and most ergonomic of the Switch controllers, and I prefer it to anything else. This controller is a must for gamers with larger hands or looking for more precise inputs, or for longer play sessions; the joy cons make my hands sore after a few hours.Unlike the Wii U pro controller, which felt flimsy and like a toy, this controller has a good weight to it and feels like a much nicer piece of equipment.",5,1,2017-9-19,1,1,0
If you have any kind of issues holding or using the joycons dont hesitate buying this.  I made the mistake of purchasing other compatible controllers only for them to stop working after system updates or not having the full functionality of the pro.  If you are thinking about upgrading from the joycon spend the extra and get this one,5,1,2019-3-31,1,1,0
"I intitially bought this to play Rocket League and any other competitive games I may buy on the Switch, but it actually works really well with some of the other games like Mario Odyssey and Breath of the Wild. The controller feels a little larger than an Xbox One controller, but it is still comfortable to use. I have a couple of minor issues with it, however. The first is that the A B X Y buttons are somewhat steep and have sharp edges. If you’ve ever played a fast paced game, you’ll know that you slide between those 4 buttons quite frequently. Sometimes I move a little too quick and it can be pretty uncomfortable. The other issue I have is the non-analog triggers. The triggers are not sensitive so any racing games or Rocket Leauge will not have sensitive acceleration or breaking. Other than those to issues, this controller is a perfect combination with the portable Switch. It will for sure be my controller of choice if and when a new Smash Bros game is released. I would recommend it to anyone who regularly plays the Switch.",5,1,2018-1-20,1,7,0
"Great feeling controller. On par with the DS4 and Xbox controllers. Compared to the joy con this controller is infinitely more comfortable. The shell replacement, if you like doing that, is incredible easy. Connecting to the switch was instantaneous, and battery life is good. Since it uses USB C it charges really fast as well. In addition steam has become compatible with switch pro controllers recently so you can use this controller on pc as well.",5,1,2019-5-2,1,0,0
"Nice design, great build quality, and a big improvement over the Joy-Con controllers. Feels a lot better in the hand than Xbox controllers.

"I love the Switch, and Joy-Cons are fine for most games; however, some games, like Doom, are much better with the Pro controller. The Pro controller is one of my favorite full-size controllers.

My hands are too big for anything but short playing times with the Joy-Cons.",5,1,2018-12-17,1,0,0
"Nintendo did this right! I recently purchased a Switch and replaced my other gaming consoles. After a couple days of playing, I realized I really wanted a ""standard"" feeling controller so I went ahead and purchased the Pro Controller.

Very happy with this purchase!",5,1,2018-1-12,1,1,0
"Every aspect of the controller is amazing to the slight concave designed to the analog sticks, the triggers with a well design economical feel, that contours to your index fingers perfectly. (My only downside is that they're not spring loaded, but nor is the actual switch controllers which makes racing games a little less fun. But it's not a deal-breaker.) The face buttons are big a perfectly spaced apart so you're not hitting all of them at the same time. And d-pad is flawless too! Of course it's going to be amazing! this is coming from the person that made the perfect d-pad design!",5,1,2019-4-12,1,0,0
"This is an awesome controller.  It is very sleek, and it seems to hold a charge for days on end.  I have only charged it the first day I got it and haven't plugged it in since, so it's definitely holding up strong.

Tried Mario Kart and the first thing on the screen is to press L and R, right? Still nothing!Tried Test Input Devices, updated the controller, held the buttons for a long time and still to no avail.

"I have had it for a few months. As someone who doesn't play games often, I think it's a comfortable enough controller. I like it better than the one bundled with the XBox One S.

Overall, it's nice.",5,1,2018-9-26,1,1,0
"No bad issues with the battery life, but I'm not a super heavy user.  I like that it uses the same charger as my phone (I can charge it while using it wirelessly if needed. ) I use it mostly for Zelda - Breath of the Wild....much better than the joycons in my opinion.  My only issue I've had it that it is very smooth plastic for the grips so it has slipped out of my hands when grabbing it and hit the floor.  (Luckily it's pretty durable so far...)",5,1,2019-1-11,1,0,0
Definitely worth the buy. The controller that comes with the Switch gets uncomfortable to use after a while. This controller has a nice lightweight build. Very comfortable in the hands. Good battery life. The analogs are very responsive. Soft yet tactile buttons. The rumble shocks (vibration) are much better than the standard Switch controllers. Button layouts are much better as well.,5,1,2017-7-25,1,2,0
"Some people use adapters so they can use an Xbox controller on their Switch, but the Xbox controller will vibrate when it's not supposed to and you can't make it stop in the Switch settings.

I have big hands and this controller is comfortable for me.",5,1,2019-8-6,1,0,0
"Compared to my PS4 controllers and the Xbox I use on my laptop, this is hands down the best controller of the bunch. The size is perfect. The weight is just the right amount of heavy. In real life it looks pretty cool. But it feels like a quality product. Joysticks are responsive and have some feedback to them. Buttons don't wear down as easily as the PS4 ones I got. Once I'm docked, I can't bother with joycons when I got this.A bit pricey but totally worth it for every Switch owner",5,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
"I've been using the default Joycon controller since I purchased the system a few years ago and decided it was time for an upgrade. This controller is leagues more comfortable and has a great battery life. The buttons and HD rumble all feel excellent. While this may be an expensive controller, I'd say it's going to be your best option. The cheaper third party controllers feel nowhere near as quality as this controller.",5,1,2019-4-9,1,0,0
"Been a gamer my whole life and have tried alot of different controllers over the years. This, in my opinion of course, is the best controller I have ever had the pleasure of owning and using. Before I purchased this, my xbox elite controller had been my favorite due to the way the controller felt in my hands. But this controller feels way more natural to hold. I literally don't have a single complaint regarding this controller. Wireless is great on it, the battery life lasts for a really long time before having to charge it again, and I also love how large the ABXY buttons are compared to xbox/ps4 controllers. I HIGHLY recommend this controller. I don't usually leave reviews, but for this one I just had to. Bravo on this one Nintendo!",5,1,2019-2-8,1,0,1
"So I've been trying to get a good cheap switch controller for a couple years, and all of the ones I got (including powerA) only lasted around 6 months before issues start appearing. I eventually got fed up with buying new controllers and went all in on a pro controller. When I got to the first one I ordered, the controller felt weighty and obviously high quality. HOWEVER, DAY ONE, not even 5 minutes in, the left stick drifts down. Returned and got a new one. This one drifts down on both sticks. I know this is a great product, but if you want to get one online, be prepared to return it.",1,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"I have to say, I prefer this controller over the joycons + connector attachment. This felt far more comfortable in my hands. The motion controls work well too - its not quite the same as the joycons for, say, aiming an arrow in BotW, its still more than adequate. Great battery life too - you can use any standard USB-C cable to charge it.",5,1,2018-1-16,1,2,0
"Awesome controller. come with a usb type C wire which can be used to charge your switch on the go. Price is still a bit in the high side but the controller is fantastic. If you don't want to spend so much money buy a Power A controller. although you will be messing the key feature such as amillbo support, rumbo, and a chargeable batteries but power A does have some cool feature to like interactable buttons and designs.",5,1,2019-3-6,1,0,0
"This is it, man. THE controller (Also, there are really no equivalent alternatives). I have hundreds of hours on mine already and It's one of the best game controls I have used in recent memory.The only change I might have made is the D-Pad. If it were a little flatter and pivoted a little more strictly, it might serve its purpose better on games like Cave Story and Tetris.",5,1,2018-4-11,1,1,0
This controller was great until just outside the warranty window when both sticks started to experience drift.  Calibration did not fix the issue and cleaning the sticks was only a temporary fix.  A controller this expensive should not have this issue.,1,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
"Was in a new unopened package as the information described it. Feels great in my hands, the price is high and if you live in a country with import taxes it gets even higher, something that was my case, yet, I love the style of it.Never tried the normal pro controller so can't say much on the entire D-pad thing apart from that it works great on this controller and it feels great. Delivery was extremely quick, something that really caught me off guard since I live in Norway and expected it to take some time. Think I had it in less than a week, and I did only pay for the normal slowest kind of transport. Overall very happy with the product, have also connected it up to my pc so I know also use it with pc games like Rocket League, took a tiny bit of calibration and worked like a charm afterward. 5/5 would buy again.",5,1,2019-2-7,1,0,0
"Love this, button placement is like Xbox, the body is like a steam controller, and the arms are like a PlayStation 4, very responsive, joysticks are as if you have extensions on (can move joysticks very far) I've had this for about 20 days and I love it,",5,1,2018-8-12,1,2,0

"We used to play switch with the joy-con but recently some of the buttons on joy-con are almost going to die, after heavy use by my son during the stay home period. Also, I am really not the fan of the size of joy-con. So I decide to have a try on the pro controller and it turns out great experience of playing. The size is perfect and the buttons are obviously durable and nice touch. Wil buy another one.",5,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
"Genuinely feels like a premium controller. This is the most comfortable controller I've ever played with. It has a very nice feeling to all of the buttons and a non-slick design. Easily my favorite controller. EASILY.The Pro Controller feels great for Smash Bros., Breath of the Wild, Mario Odyssey, Link's Awakening, and Super Mario Maker. If nothing else, it is worth to pick this controller up to have the option of play if you want a more traditional feeling controller over the more innovative and experimental Joy-Cons. It also has motion controls so you're not missing out on anything using this controller. I would recommend this controller to anyone, ""Pro"" or not.",5,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"This control has great form factor, holds a charge a long time, making it leagues above the controller that the switch comes with. However, I only once let it get to zero power, plugged it in to charge over night, and it was dead the next morning.  I only had it 6 month when this happened, and I am almost positive that it died from overcharge. Devices dying from overcharge was a common issue 8 years ago. Devices today have smart charging to prevent over charge battery death. For $60.00 I expected this device to have those technologies, which is why I can only give 3 stars.",3,1,2018-9-9,1,0,0
"Ordered it, opened it, brand new, left joystick was drifting drastically, making the controller unusable, I thought “hmm maybe I just got a bad one, I’ll return it and have them send me another one.” I got the second one same exact problem, left stick drifting drastically downward. Sent it back, never will purchase another one, I expected a quality product from the name brand, what I got was a broken mess.",1,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"It's an overpriced  xbox 360/one controller with nintendo slapped on it that has analog sticks that like to get stuck. But if you play your Switch docked you already know how annoying it is to take the joy cons on and off for charging, so you''ll likely break down and purchase this eventually.It does have a long battery life , and the rumble works well. But come on, the regular price is just too high..",4,1,2019-2-23,1,0,0

"Amazing controller. Everything about the pro controller is an improvement over the Joy Cons, and I already love the Joy Cons. The rubberized texture of the grips are comfortable to use over long periods of time and the buttons are responsive without being overly ""clicky."" This is now my go-to controller for anything I can connect it to, as the amazing battery life and all around comfort of the controller have made me reflect on how I settled with anything else for this long. Not to mention the colors and Xenoblade representation put this a step above the normal black pro controller. If you can't get this one, i'd also recommend the Splatoon 2 version to add a bit more character to your Switch accessory collection.",5,1,2018-7-2,1,1,0
"Great Design, feels like and improvement over ps4 dualshock or xbox controller, still the sugested retail price in mi opinion is steep, this should be shipped with the console, not to be purchased separately, but it comes with no suprise given that is after all Nintendo, it is well known that their business model relies on peripherals and add ons (useless robots, blasters, rumble packs, transfer packs, expansion packs, etcetera) that do not come with the console.",4,1,2019-5-31,1,0,0
"So glad i was able to get this. I did wait until one day amazon had it on sale as it is a bit pricey for a controller. However, I like it so much more than the joycon. Having a real controller to use makes all the difference. Charge is lasting for hours and easily charges from the switch doc.Def a must have for the switch if you can get it for a good price.",5,1,2017-7-26,1,2,0
"I'm not about to use my Switch in it's portable form. Knowing that, this is so much more comfortable than it's given controller. I game with the PS4 mostly, and even after hours with the Switch pro controller, my fingers don't feel remotely sore. I don't even feel like I pulled a marathon like I do on other systems.",5,1,2018-8-2,1,2,0
"I like this controller more than using the colored Switch controllers on the mount. This controller is more ergonomic, with more intuitive button placement. Good fit for both male and female sized hands as all friends have said they prefer this controller. Good battery life. Can actually use this controller with the Switch while it is off the docking station.",5,1,2019-6-30,1,0,0
"I knocked one star off this review because I feel that the smaller buttons on the face of this controller should be a little larger and taller.  By this I mean the screen capture button, the home button and the minus/plus buttons.  Overall, however, this is a very good controller for the Nintendo Switch.  4 stars.",4,1,2018-9-29,1,1,0
"I was hesitant to get one of these because it considerably more expensive then other switch controller options, but all the reports I looked at gravitated to the idea that its worth the extra money because its very well made. After getting mine, I agree with that sentiment. It is very solid, has a good weight, joysticks feel solid and the buttons press nicely. Its definitely the best feeling of any of the full controllers I have.",5,1,2019-1-28,1,0,0
"This controller feels great in your hands and has a very long battery life. However, I've noticed that the L and R buttons sometimes don't work if you deliberately try to lightly press down on them. The reason why I'm still giving it 5 stars is because I've never actually had any issues when I'm playing games that use these buttons. It could be that I press these buttons more harder when I'm playing a game (I don't mash down on these buttons, only hard enough and it works fine).",5,1,2019-2-27,1,0,0
"When docked I HIGHLY prefer this controller over the Switch's bundled controller that uses the joycons. It fits in my hands much better with less fatigue and all of the game functions/button are laid out in a way much easier to hit vs the joycons.Don't get the crummy wired ones, the wireless PRO is the way to go!",5,1,2018-8-8,1,1,0
If you Play games on a regular basis this is a must buy. The Joy Con controllers are outclassed by the Pro controller in every concievable way except for the lack of HD rumble. The fantastic ergonomics will make extended gaming very comfortable and the controller was supported by every game I've played so far (its especially good for shooters). It pairs up even better than the default Joy Cons. It has a good battery life. It has a REAL D-pad and not that nonsense that everyone pretends is a D-pad on the left Joy Con. The analog sticks are also positioned much better than the Joy Cons are when they're connected to either side of the Switch. The triggers aren't the best when compared to the Xbox One and PS4 controllers but that is a nitpick. If you are above the age of 10 and play games as a hobby you NEED this controller. Let your friends and small children play with those Joy Cons.,5,1,2018-4-18,1,1,0
"This controller is great.  I have always been an Xbox guy, so this controller, with its offset sticks, feels very natural.  It seems like it’s based on the Xbox 360 controller, which is (I think) the best controller ever made.  Seems to be very well made, also.  Very solid feeling.  A great upgrade over the joy-con controller that comes with the switch.",5,1,2018-1-15,1,2,0
An essential piece of hardware for the Switch. This controller is much more comfortable and has better button accuracy than the joy cons in the packages grip. Each button is clicky and accurate. I just purchased mine this week in November and did not notice any D-pad inaccuracies that launch controllers had. Do yourself a favor and buy one!,5,1,2017-12-2,1,2,0
"Despite the freedom the joycons give you, I still prefer this style of controller for more serious gameplay. It fits great in my hands and motion controls are impeccable. Not nearly as finnicky as the joycons. Charge lasts for a very long time and it recharges very quickly. Honestly can't think of anything wrong with it.",5,1,2018-1-25,1,2,0
"Overall, this controller is more durable and functional for the type of games I play on the Nintendo Switch. The feel is more comfortable as it is one complete unit compared to the Joy-Cons attaching to the controller point.The charge on the controller is incredible as it lasts for about an entire week or slightly longer before I have to do it again and the charge is quick overnight.",5,1,2019-5-18,1,0,0
"I doubt you'll need this review to factor in if you're buying this or not, but here you go. If you think you might want this for your switch, I say do it. Playing mario kart is a million times easier. The buttons press so smoothly. It's a night and day difference.",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"This thing is expensive but soooooo worth it, as many first party Nintendo accessories tend to be. The controller is comfortable, mimicking the Xbox controller style that many manufacturers do these days. The battery life is solid, around 40 hrs. I went on a Breath of the Wild marathon on my first charge and didnt charge again for about a week. It is study, durable, and the sticks feel waaaaay better than the Joy Con. Highly recommended.",5,1,2019-3-20,1,0,0
"I personally prefer the actual joy-con controller but this controller feels nice as well. There's two people who play the switch in the house so two controllers are a must and this is what I ended up getting and I have no regrets! It has a firm grip but it does feel different and a bit wider to grip if you always use the joy-con controller but it's still works. It was delivered flawless, no faults or anything which is probably the primary worry of buying electronics online or in general. Also, I really like the aesthetics of the controller. Very nice!",5,1,2017-6-30,1,0,0
If you mostly or frequently play your Switch in home console mode this controller is an absolute must have. It might be the most comfortable controller I've ever used (up there with the Xbox One) and it's got no flakiness in the wireless connection like my joy-cons sometimes get. Highly recommend this for anyone putting in extended sessions on their docked Switch.,5,1,2019-5-26,1,0,0
I actually bought this controller before I got my Switch. But my instinct was telling me that the Pro Controller would be a necessity. And my instincts were right.This is a very comfortable controller to use. Much more comfortable for me to use than the Joycons because of my hand size.,5,1,2018-3-21,1,1,0
"This is one of the most comfortable controllers that I have used in years. Very solid and feels good in your hands, especially after using the JoyCons. If you have a Nintendo Switch, this is a must-own accessory. The price may seem high, but it includes an Amiibo NFC reader and HD Rumble. The D-pad is really nice for retro games, which you lack with the JoyCons.",5,1,2017-7-5,1,2,0
"Had larger buttons for an adults hands, unlike the switch with its child sized joycon buttons....Honestly, Nintendo needs to make ""adult"" button sized joycons, using buttons the size of the pro controller, so adults can properly use it in handheld mode. Otherwise I always need to use it in TV mode.",5,1,2017-11-3,1,2,0
"I'm on my second one now because I love the controller so much, honestly one of the best I've  used for any console I've played (which is everything N64 to date) but's pretty disappointing that I had to1. Replace it after a year of fairly regular use, I'm not so mad, just a bummer that the thumbstick crapped out after just a year",3,1,2018-12-29,1,1,0
"Can't argue with the quality here.  It feels solid, has both rumble and motion tracking, and fits adult hands.  If you play on a TV, I highly recommend it.  The only complaint is that + and - are a bit harder to reach than I'm used to.  But I love that it feels so high quality and appropriately heavy.  If you're a gamer, used to standard controllers, it feels more natural.",5,1,2017-5-13,1,3,0
You absolutely need this for comfort when it comes to playing BOTW or any other game on the Switch. The Joy cons are too small for my hands and this feels so right. It's actually more comfortable than a PS4 or XBox controller. Now am I saying this controller will fix your life? No it won't but it will making playing single player games so much more comfortable.,5,1,2017-12-2,1,2,0
This is a great product when you can use it. It’s best for one player focused action. Nintendo really does make the controllers confusing letting you use them only some of the time and then making it slightly different muscle memory if you use a joy  con vs. this controller. Battery charge lasts a long time. I would get it again.,5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"Given that the last Nintendo console controllers feeling sort of ”toyish” (and the price tag on this one) I initially considered simply getting a third party controller and calling it day.I’m so glad I didn’t! This controller is excellent. It feels great, it’s sturdy, definitely feels “premium” and worth the price tag.",5,1,2018-11-14,1,0,0
"The price is outrageous, like all Nintendo stuff, but it is well made and solid.It connects easily and has a USB C cable included, so you can play even when charging; which is something you can't do with the standard controllers.",4,1,2018-9-7,1,1,0
"Got it to play Legend of Zelda breath of the Wild because it ,unlike my previous  third-party controller, has a NFC scanner on it. Only thing I don't like about it is the same thing I don't like about any controlers for the Nintendo switch so far. I don't like that the L3 is linked to the analog. It should be it's own button because I will sometimes accidentally pressed it when I hold L2 and left analog down.",4,1,2018-3-2,1,1,0
"Highly recommend buying at least one of these for your console. Stock to the original Nintendo brand and avoid third party knock offs, unless they are licensed by the Nintendo. It is better size than the joycons. I wish they had kept “+” and “-“ buttons similar to joycons.",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"I'm an older gamer with arthritis, so need a controller easy to handle.  This is easy to use, and makes playing my games a lot better.  I would recommend this for anyone, but especially for older gamers.  I haven't tried other controllers, but then, I found the right one first",5,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"This is a really nice Controller. It is a bit of a higher price then Play Station and X box Controller's but, it dose come with the rechargeable battery and from what I have seen it is the same batter that is in the 3DS. It come with the USB to USB-c cable that is needed to charge it. The batter seem's to last 40+ game play hours before it need's to be charged.",5,1,2017-6-28,1,2,0
"Works as expected, love the fact it is rechargeable and does not require batteries that have to be switched out once depleted.  It was a breeze to match to the switch.  So happy I didn’t waste the money or time on a cheaper model.  I recommend only getting Nintendo brand.  You had to spend 300 on the system, why cheap out on the other stuff??",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"Maybe the price is high but is the most comfortable controller I've ever used in my life (after GameCube controller of course) and is compatible with PC games downloaded in your Steam client...thank you steam. I play like 10 hours before the battery die and I think is a good duration, gyroscope and rumble work well. But no include and usb cable for recharge, you must use the Switch's one or a cell phone charger (but under your risk).",5,1,2019-1-4,1,0,0
"This thing offers a whole new level of comfort compared to the joy-cons, especially if you have larger hands. The buttons and analog sticks all feel really good and responsive, trigger buttons as well. It has a bit more weight compared to some other controllers, but that's not a bad thing. You can also use this as a PC controller and connect it with bluetooth. Highly recommend.",5,1,2019-2-12,1,0,0
"Far more robust than the base joycon controllers. Better button feel. Probably better than any other gaming console controller I have ever owned. After playing Breath of the Wild mostly with this controller, I went and played using the joycon controllers attached to the portable screen, which is just not nearly as enjoyable of a gaming experience as using the pro-controller.",5,1,2019-6-24,1,0,0
I bought these controller to use when I'm playing my nintendo switch docked. I have big hands so this controller does wonders for me since the joy-cons are really small as well as for the buttons.

"Update: I reached out to Nintendo and they repaired the controller at no cost, and now the controller works perfectly. I have no complaintsThis controller was great for about the first 2 months.

"This is a much better way to play than the built in little sticks (to me).  I really like the feel of this controller.  So much so that I take this with me on the road when I travel.The controller feels very sturdy, much like an XBox controller.  Battery life is great (I tested for 25 hours and then plugged it in).",5,1,2018-6-24,1,1,0
"i was lucky enough to snag a pre-order of this the day before its initial release but then my left joystick got on the fritz so i decided to get a new one just in case my old one isn't just a simple fix. once i got it i put the new ones box next to my old box and came to the shocking realization that i received the European version not the American version that i initial got, so i was pretty butthurt about that. but if that isn't an issue for you guys this is in my opinion the best pro-controller right now. i also have the regular pro Controller and having already played with this version I don't feel right playing with the original after getting to use this one. if you're on the fence this is a definite buy!",5,1,2018-3-23,1,1,0
"I've bought a second pro controller because my other one had drift problems. So far this one is good. I had my first one for a year, but if I'm paying $70 for a controller I expect it to last longer than that. My left joy con also drifts. Nintendo needs to fix their controllers or at least make some new improved version. It's absolutely ridiculous!",3,1,2019-7-23,1,1,0
"Nintendo’s controllers are some of the best feeling, most responsive, controllers made. The battery life is excellent and they feel solid. The only thing I deducted a star for was the amiibo reader, it doesn’t work nearly as well at the Joycon reader.

"Definitively, the best experience playing the Switch is with this controller. The grips are fantastic and do not need any further enhancement. I let my girlfriend play with this controller whenever we play Mario Kart because it offers such a competitive advantage, and she really needs that when playing against me.",5,1,2019-8-31,1,0,0
"Wow! I wish I had gotten this when I first bought my switch! It makes games so much easier to play, and it really brings the console to life. Games like Doom, D3, and Super Smash are worlds different with this controller.If you plan on playing any first-person games or games that require aiming, this controller makes a night and day difference over the Joy-Cons.",5,1,2019-3-7,1,0,0
"Solid controller definitely feels well constructed, only issue is when waking up the switch if you press any button but the home button it wont wake the switch up and it seems to go into search mode for a few seconds and it wont wake your switch during this, even if I press the home button..",4,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"I like this controller a lot.  The buttons all feel great.  I know it's considered overpriced, but I didn't mind paying $60 for it.  I think the joycon controller is pretty good, this is just a little better and more comfortable.  I can't say whether you should choose it over any of the cheaper options from other companies - maybe some of those are really great too.",5,1,2018-4-9,1,1,0
If you got big hands then this is your controller.  It's solidly built and connects super easy.  Buttons work great and have had no issues.  I can't use the smaller controllers that come with the switch so this is a great alternative.,5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
Has some drift and the joysticks do not have as much of a resistance as I’d like - harder to make finer movements in FPS games like Doom. Also the right grip is a bit flimsy and shifts back and forth (I’ve tried tightening with electronic screwdriver but still shifts around).,3,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"Best controller I've used, good quality, works well and has good battery life, also the sensibility on the buttons and sticks is so much better than cheaper controllers'I play smash ultimate quite a lot and it has endured it. Before this one I bought a PowerA controller but it died within two months. So, im loving this one.",5,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"This controller works with the Switch docked and undocked in its portable mode. I also use this controller on my PC more than I use my Dualshock 4 because the cord stays in a lot better. If you're playing a shooting game on PC, this is the best controller out that isn't a custom one. The gyro works perfectly too and makes aiming with a controller way easier.",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"Pros: long battery life. Charges quickly.Cons:The throw on the sticks is too long, and often gets misinterpretted when playing a game that requires a lot of fast movement.

"I didn't pick one up at launch because I thought the joycon would be fine. When Mario Kart 8 Deluxe came out, the joycon weren't as comfortable to play with. I picked this up and I don't think I'll ever go back to the joycon. It's so comfortable and I play it with Zelda which I play the most. It also lasts longer than the joycon. I found myself having to constantly charge them if they weren't with the tablet. However with this I've barely had to worry. Now I wish I had gotten it at launch.",5,1,2017-5-7,1,1,0
"This is the best controller I've ever used. It's comfortable to hold, buttons are responsive, and it holds a charge really well. I didn't think that I needed this, since the switch comes with the joycons, but I was wrong. Every switch owner should have this.",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"This is a really nice controller. It has the solid feel of an Xbox One controller, and the battery life is quite long too. When switching from handheld to TV the button placement is so well done that you never have to look down to translate between the two schemes. Highly recommended. And it’s an official Nintendo thing so you know that it will never break.",5,1,2017-11-17,1,2,0
I love the pro controller for my switch. The controller is so much easy to use compare to the joy con. Especially for old fashion gamer who still like controller over anything. The controller also come with a usbC to usb cable so you can use it to charge your switch and save you couple of dollars of getting a usbC cable when you travel.,5,1,2018-4-12,1,1,0
"It's a good controller overall. It is comfortable, has a long battery life, good button response. The major drawback is the vibration is extremely weak, which makes differences in vibration very subtle to detect. I've gotten used to it over a few months, but some might find it annoying, or it may be insufficient for certain games.",4,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"I was shocked when I received this product. I didn't expect Nintendo to make such an awesome product. This controller feels like an xbox one controller, it has big fat X Y A B buttons that stick out, a firm d-pad, xbox style analog sticks. One down fall is that the zl and zr triggers have no resistance . . . They're just buttons, it may bother some when it comes to shooters.",5,1,2019-6-15,1,1,0
"When I first unwrapped the Pro Controller and held it I was astounded at how *good* it felt to hold it. I wouldn't have thought a controller could feel better than an Xbox 360 controller, but Nintendo's newest (and rather pricey) Pro Controller definitely surpasses it. I actually just pick it up at random, without playing a game, to marvel at the quality and amazing feel. Weird, I know.The design feels solid without too much weight, the handles have a comfortable grippy material pleasant to the touch, and the buttons and control sticks are larger than the Joy-Con's buttons and sticks. The good ol' Nintendo d-pad is nice to have as well.",5,1,2017-5-10,1,0,0
Came in exactly as the description said. Couldn’t be any happier having this in my possession now.,5,1,2020-5-10,1,1,0
"Much more comfortable than the normal joycon setup. I’m still not happy about the price, but it holds battery, is comfortable, and performs well. It is a little heavier than a PS4 controller, but this does not bother me that much. The light design on the controller is minimalistic and aesthically pleasing. I especially like using it for Smash Ultimate.",5,1,2019-2-24,1,0,0
"Expensive? Yes. Should be included with the Switch? Likely. Worth it? Yes!Quality controller and feels great in my hands. Going back to the Joy-Con while mobile feels painful after using this controller. Not just in the size and the grip, but the quality of the joysticks.",5,1,2018-1-11,1,2,0
"Feels like a real controller. Has a nice heft to it and the buttons have a good feel to it compared to using any cheaper options for switch controllers. The perfect blend of being smooth but having enough matte feel to it for it to not feel slippery. I bought two of these and if I need to get another controller, this is the one that I’d buy.",5,1,2019-5-2,1,0,0
"See title: I used stock joy cons for the entirety of BotW, Mario Odyssey, Gris, Mario Kart, AND Smash... before buying this MASTERPIECE. Phenomenal D-pad. Not my favorite controller, but ABSOLUTELY miles above joycon inserts that come with the Switch. If you're a fan of PS4, Steam Controller, etc. this controller is for you. Price point a bit high though.",5,1,2019-3-9,1,0,0
"Solid controller. The vibration is great, spacing of buttons is good, only wish the triggers weren’t treated as buttons, you can’t press them down part way like other controllers. It reaches a set point and then is active. Other than that, it’s great for games like Astral Chain.",5,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
"Feels Great in my hands, holds battery for a good amount of time. The Charging cord is long enough for me to play while charging if I sit a few feet away from my TV. Also, the controller doesn't have the Ghosting Problem like others do, (Where the analog stick registers that it is being pressed either left or right, so when you are not using the controller, it is moving the camera or your character without any input from you.)",5,1,2019-5-6,1,0,0
It's the official standard. Feels great in my hands. The tension in the joysticks and buttons is on point. You can turn your Switch on and off with a single button.You owe it to yourself to get one of these if you play a lot of single player. Do it.,5,1,2018-12-25,1,1,0
"Love it! Much better than the joycons! The first one I got, the left bumper was weird and didn't press correctly. It was returned and got a replacement and it works fabulous! Definitely the best way to play the switch! My only gripe is the price. It is way too expensive for what it is. It's a great controller, but it is just too expensive.",4,1,2018-2-20,1,1,0
"The controller is excellent.. functions perfectly and feels right. It's ther third package I've had placed on my front porch steps while raining, though. Fortunately the shipping box absorbed most of the rain and the product box received very little moisture. Had it been scooted forward even a foot.. a roof covers the porch and would have been completely dry.",5,1,2018-12-21,1,0,0
"My left joystick became unresponsive on my OEM joy-con so I started looking for a replacement. To replace the left joy-con itself cost almost the same as this Pro one so IMO its a no-brainer. This Pro controler has a nice weight to it and feels better in hand than the regular splitable joy-cons. It charges via usb so no need for batteries either. Bottom line is if you need a new controler, need an additional or just want to have the best Pro controller made by Nintendo buy this one.",5,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
I bought this to play Fortnite and for two player Minecraft and I am very happy with this controller. Similar to the Xbox 360 controller feels good in the hand nice weight feels solid and keeps a charge for a long time.,5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
This thing really made Breath of the Wild easier for me; using the joycons I would accidentily press in on the analog sticks constantly -- usually resulting in my death during combat.  No problem with this.  It's actually one of the most solidly-built controllers I've come across recently!,5,1,2017-11-21,1,2,0
These are good for awhile but heavy use causes the sticks to act up. Playing fortnite on the swich since August I have sent one back. Two others are acting up. The stick seems to start failing when a character starts creeping by itself. The one I sent back I no longer could stop this from happening. The other two can be stopped for now but this failure is a pain while playing.,3,1,2018-11-22,1,0,0
"This version had a updated version of the D-pad and it isn't bad anymore. With older versions it was  inaccurate and many times would simply twist the inputs.If you are not familiar with the Nintendo Switch Pro controller, it is good to have 40h autonomy and a nice grip but I do think it doesn't last too much.",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"Great controller! It's very comfortable and fits well in the hands. Holds a lot of charge, exactly as much as Nintendo advertises(maybe a little more). There is one flaw that prevents me from giving this product 5 stars. The down button on the Directional pad activates sometimes when pressing left or right on it. It may seem minor but it may severely impact some games which require crisp movement.",4,1,2017-9-1,1,1,0
"If you're like me used to gaming with both ps4 and xbox one controllers, or either one,  this switch pro controller is for you. Comfortable and much more natural to use. Even if you don't don't game on a ps4 or xbox one this controller feels much better in my hands than the standard switch controller. Price is steep but I say worth it.",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"This controller feels very premium. The price may offset some, but once you get your hands on it, you'll understand why. Solid build, artistic design, clicky and responsive buttons, and it uses the 3dsxl battery built into it, allowing for extremely long play sessions before even needing to charge. To top it all off, it even charges on USB type c cables. Now that's quality",5,1,2018-10-23,1,0,0
"Best controller I've ever used, period. Everyone has their own preferences, of course, but I can definitely say that it is the definitive way to play the Switch and it is well worth the $70. I will never go back. Kudos to Nintendo for finally making a worthy conventional controller, and in this case, they exceeded expectations.",5,1,2017-6-25,1,2,0
"I work as a hairstylist, and that alongside doing art and playing video games, it really takes its toll. I buckled down and got a pro controller because I've started seeing some warning signs of carpal tunnel syndrome in my right hand, and this controller. Holy crap. It's awesome. Well worth the money. Splatoon is way easier, Mario kart is way better, and Legend of Zelda is the best experience with this controller. I don't like using the pro controller for Tetris 99 however, the buttons sometimes don't do the right control, so I'll use the joy cons and grip with that game, otherwise this is well worth the money.",5,1,2019-7-13,1,0,0
"Seems well built, but the warranty is short because of a design flaw in the joystick.  Started drifting hard down 2 weeks after the warranty expired.  Thought I way paying extra for the perfect controller.",2,1,2019-5-10,1,2,1
"I was determined to get this on sale and it was well worth it. I have small hands and the joy-con are perfect for most games, but this controller is pretty great for all others. The sticks are the same size, while other controllers generally have huge buttons. It's really touchy and responsive too which is great, and you can charge while you play. This will likely be my #1 controller unless we're traveling.",5,1,2018-12-13,1,0,0
I bought this before price dropped. I paid the original $80 each. I bought two controllers. Those controllers did not break on the hands of several 6 years old children who plays on my Nintendo Switch. Those are not like Xbox One controllers. It's super sturdy and probably last longer than $50 Xbox One controllers will.,5,1,2018-6-20,1,1,0
I thought it might not work with the new switch lite but it did. And I really enjoy using it to play on the switch.,5,1,2020-2-26,1,3,0
Maybe i got a defective controller but ive seen a few reviews with the same issue as well as on the internet. The left analog stick has a mind of its own (moving on its own) and calibrating it seems to do nothing.,2,1,2018-5-16,1,2,0
"My joycon controllers had drift beyond repair, so I sought out a Pro controller to replace them. Best investment any Switch Owner can make. 90% of games support it, and it can be used wired or wireless. I have noticed a tad bit of input lag (less than .5 seconds) but I believe this is due to my TV and no fault of the controller itself.",5,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
This product is not made well.  The joysticks wear out very quickly.  The wear is visible as their is a white residue that builds up on the joystick.  It's likely the plastic of the joystick against the casing.  It is also not a generous warranty period.  It is only three months and then it's $30 plus tax.  I would recommend you look into a 3rd party controller.  They will likely be cheaper and as well as better quality.,1,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0
This controller is far more comfortable to use than the adaptor that they include with the Switch to turn the motion controllers into a single controller.  Build quality is great and setup is super simple.  I would have given this controller 5 stars if the feel were better.  The analog sticks feel rather loose when compared to my PS or Xbox controllers.  So it makes playing games like DOOM not as natural as it was on those systems.,4,1,2018-4-23,1,1,0
"I thought when I first got this that I wouldn't use it, but I was wrong. As a gamer who owns multiple consoles, this is the most comfortable controller I have ever used. Very durable, great quality and lasts very long before charging. Small and fits easily into a small bag.",5,1,2018-1-12,1,2,0
"If you are playing at home a lot or places or places where you aren't on the go as much, the Pro Controller is absolutely necessary. I primarily play in docked mode, and this controller is amazing. It has the best battery life of any of the console controllers on the market. It feels great in hand and is easy to use. No complaints at all. It's my second favorite controller ever built for the consoles.",5,1,2018-10-9,1,0,0

This controller is a much better feel than the tiny joy cons are especially because I have large hands. The battery life on this controller is insane compared to the joy cons as well.,5,1,2020-4-5,1,1,0
"Had no issues at all, i've been using it since smash came out and with most of the indie games in the eshop. love the controller, it's really comfortable, and it feels kind of heavy, but  you can feel it's because of the quality of the pieces they used, would definitely buy another one and would definitely recommend you to get one. Battery is great, sometimes i use it for days without having to charge it.",5,1,2018-12-27,1,1,0
The price seems gouged especially cuz nintendo has this market cornered. But I do not regret the purchase and it's very comfy especially compared to joycons. I love that it is compatible with other devices like Steam or my Fire TV. It functions well and the charge lasts a long time.,4,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"The controller has great ergonomics and battery life but it lags in one game - Timberman. The strange thing is, the Joycons don't face this issue for this game. Other than that, I haven't really noticed any other issues so far. Will update if I find more.",4,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"For someone whose hands cramp up using the Joy-cons, this thing is a godsend. On the pricier side, but for wireless, motion, and rumble, you have to pay that price.  Most of the cheaper controllers don't support those functions, so this is the way to go if you need those things.In about 20 hours of use so far, the only complaint I have is that the analog sticks don't feel like they give as much range of motion as the Dual Shock 4.  I find that I don't have far to push before I'm pushing the stick against the limit of it's movement radius.  Would have been nice for a little more control in this area, but it still beats the heck out of the Joycons.",4,1,2018-4-13,1,1,0
I've always been a fan of Xbox controllers only but this is a very comfortable well built controller. The button lay out was a little weird to get use to with the a being on the right and b at the bottom. It seems well built and the battery last pretty long. Overall I think its worth the price.,5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"I love this controller so much more than the original Switch JoyCon. It's easy to use and makes playing certain games way better from a controls standpoint (example, Zelda Breath of the Wild).

I even tried replacing the battery and it still doesn't work.",3,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0

"You have hands that are bigger than a robin's claws.  This is a fact.  You need a controller that is comfortable to hold.

There were no issues with the controller whatsoever.",5,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0
"This is mostly okay, but doesn't quite fit my expectations for a ""pro controller"". The buttons are too mushy, and the d-pad is all one piece. This makes playing games like Celeste very difficult toward the final levels - not because of player skill, but because you will often need to switch from left to right on the d-pad. Those kind of switches causes d-pads that aren't separated to hit up/down along the way, and one mis-click can ruin a game.It's nice if you want to casually play switch with a more-conventional controller, but labeling it as ""pro controller"" is maybe the wrong move here.",3,1,2018-5-23,1,0,0
"Comfort wise, I'd put this controller right up there with the best - the Xbox One controller. Much more comfortable to hold than those tiny Joy-Con things, even on the grip accessory.

"So do you want to spend two or three times the amount of money for this instead of on an off-brand controller?

But soo much more comfortable than using the joycons in that weird little grip, that thing always cramped my hands after a while. I've been playing Skyrim with this controller and it works well, the motion controls are good for aiming my bow and arrows. Battery is good, d-pad is good, no complaints really.

"I bought this controller around January after hearing all the great news about it, and they're not wrong! The controller is big, with big buttons, feels comfortable, and it has a long battery life! Simple, but one of my favorite controllers of all time. Much better than Joy Con's if you ask me. However, If you are planning to buy a pro controller, buy it when it comes on sale. The Pro Controller is still on sale a bunch of times here and there and I bought it when it was $55, and to be honest, $70 for this controller is a bit too pricey in my opinion.",5,1,2019-4-24,1,1,0
"If you're even considering to buy a Nintendo Switch, this Pro Controller is essential to enjoying the switch. Firstly, it gives you another method of playing switch games. While the joycons are fine for most games, and even are better in some games (Puyo Puyo Tetris) every other game just feels so much better with the Pro Controller. The sticks are much bigger and comfortable on the Pro Controller, and everything is positioned and slanted in such a way that it feels AMAZING to hold in your hands. Some may complain that the triggers aren't analog, but they feel really nice too and have their own feel that is still great. If you need a second controller, or are looking for a better game to play your games, you NEED this.",5,1,2018-10-8,1,0,0
Left joy pad had an issue where character would just walk a certain direction. But was able to return it. Apparently it’s an issue with an older joy con design. Otherwise great controller.

"Tried a highly rated 3rd party controller 1st to see if it would do the job at a lower price point. It was ok, joysticks and buttons felt clunky and cheap. Within a week it had drifting issues. Returned it for this official Nintendo controller and the difference is very obvious. Connects immediately, buttons and joysticks feel really smooth and of a much higher quality. Buy nice, or buy twice. I would definitely recommend this and I might buy another as my joy cons that came with the Switch are having drift issues and are uncomfortable to use with my giant hands.",5,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0

I've been using it to play Breath of the Wild for who knows how many hours and it's only been charged once so far!

The controller is fantastic. Best controller layout I've ever used. It is a must buy if you own a switch. I have 2. One for me and one for my girlfriend. The only thing that might not be as good as other controllers is the triggers are not pressure sensitive. They just click in. So if they end up making a racing game they can't have half throttle with the trigger half pushed in. 100% would recommend. And Amazon had it at the best price I've seen $58.,5,1,2018-4-9,1,0,0
"A good combination of DS4 and Xbox controller. Better ABXY buttons and D-pads than the Xbox controller while maintaining a similar grip feel.

"I play my switch docked most of the time so I started feeling the need to upgrade over the joy cons. Though they are great for their intended purpose (sharing, playing undocked, Wii-mote & nunchuck style) joy cons just don't compare to a traditional controller. The pro has a solid weight and feel to it and is just flat out more ergonomic (the button spacing is an especially great improvement over the joy cons).",5,1,2018-3-1,1,1,0
"The Pro controller operates as designed and is nice to hold. I love the rumble (admittedly one of the reasons I went with the Pro), and the charge is great. I didn't time it out but I don't have to charge the controller often. I plug it in whenever it gives the low battery indicator on the TV screen. I wish they had more designs that were around the same price point, but I'm satisfied with this sleek black color anyhow.",5,1,2019-9-29,1,0,0
"This would easily replace my Xbox One Elite controller for PC Gaming if it had buttons/paddles underneath.The face buttons are nice and big - I played Super Smash with joycons on launch night, and my thumbs hurt real bad the next day.

"Great controller. If you are a Switch owner considering another controller, I would recommend having one Pro Controller around as it offers a better experience. It offers a better grip, a more accurate and sensitive analog stick, and better tactile qualities to the buttons. In case you haven't noticed, it doesn't split into two like the typical Switch Joy-Cons. The only setback is that it must be charged every now and then via the Switch power chord, but you can get a charging dock.",5,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0

Really a nice controller. Better than ps4 but not quite Xbox one. The build quality is good. I like the no frills button layout. Comfortable and weighty but not heavy.

I liked this controller for about a 3 months. Purchased this in Jan and now it will say its connected but the trigger buttons with stop working along with the analog sticks getting stuck in random directions while they are in a anchored state. Battery is fully charged and the switch is stationed about 2 feet away from the controller.

"Its a good controller with a similar layout than the xbox one controller, something that i really liked about this controller is the fact that it has a huge range, i can be playing with my switch on the living room and the controller would automatically connect and work even though its on my house second floor far away from the console. For smash players like me, its a good controller but needs to get used to it because of the layout. But so far so good",5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,0
a must have if you own a Nintendo switch.  the controller it comes with just sucks if your older than 10yrs old.  just buy it.  durability seems fine had it for a while as long as your mature and dont throw it around it should hold up fine ... unlike my 150$ xbox one elite controller... thats another story....,5,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0

I had been using split Joy Cons while playing Breath of the Wild and was pretty satisfied but within minutes of using the Pro Controller I was highly impressed.

I can go about a week before I have to charge the controller and I use it quite often.,5,1,2018-4-1,1,2,0
I didn't have any issues with the regular switch controllers besides battery life. I don't have to charge this one as often. Plus have the ability to play plugged in if I ever did need to.

The only way to enjoy Mario Kart 8, Zelda: Breath of the Wild and many other games (like the upcoming Splatoon!)I'm surprised that you could find a controller that actually feels superior to an Xbox One controller, but this does.

I just got a Switch for Christmas and wanted a real controller to use for my games when it was docked. So far I've really loved this controller. Had no issues with it and it lasts forever.

"Almost everything about this controller is perfect. The sticks feel as good as an Xbox One controller. The A B X Y buttons are perfectly sized and feel great to press. The only down side is the D-Pad. If you're looking for a controller with a good D-Pad this is not the controller for you. Inputs are not as precise as you want and it's a little too spongey. My other minor issue it the layout of the Plus, Minus, Home, and Screenshot buttons. When playing games like BoTW and fortnite I find myself accidentally pressing the screen shot rather than minus that would bring up the map. Not the biggest issues but I thought it to be notable. All in all a great controller for switch.",5,1,2018-7-18,1,1,0

Better than using joycons and a grip. However this controller feels inferior to PS4 and Xbone controllers. Sad as it costs more :(. The ABXY buttons are a bit rattley and feel more like my $20 logitech controller than a proper $60-70 console controller. Also the sides of the joysticks are shedding plastic dust after normal use.

The joy-con controls are nice however the buttons is a bit smaller than what I’m used to.  Pro controller has the weight and solid feel of a ps4 or xbox controller.  Feels better for me on my hands.  A well made controller.  Just wish they had more color choices.,5,1,2019-9-24,1,0,0
"Having played for almost 10 months with the JoyCons and then switching to the Pro Controller I cannot be more happy with this purchase. It has enhanced my experience with the Switch (which was great to begin with) and made it awesome to play shooter games (i.e Fortnite) and Smash, amongst other. I definetly recommend it!",5,1,2019-2-17,1,0,0
I've tried to use the dock for the joycons that came with my switch for a while and it's just way too small for my hands. I love to play the switch docked and using the Pro controller is really the way to go. All of the same functionality but it is significantly more ergonomic.,5,1,2019-5-13,1,0,0
"If you live with your significant other you WILL fight over this remote. It is amazing, all of the buttons are smooth and don’t stick. And there is no lag!! By far the best remote I have ever used (that includes xbox and ps4)",5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"If your an adult you owe it to yourself to get a pro control. The comfort is worth the cost alone. The joycons are great but in handheld mode your hands cramp after a few hrs catching some shiny pokemon. But with a pro control your hands stay cramp free.  Battery lifes excellent, and comes with a usb charge cable.",5,1,2019-2-1,1,0,0
"Love the feel and size of the controller. The buttons and d-pad has nice click feeling to it when precessed down. Fits perfect on my hand.

So much better for playing Smash than the joy cons! No issues with connecting to my Switch and it feels like it will hold up to more abuse than the joy cons. Only reason it's not getting five stars is because I wish the ABXY buttons could be differentiated in a way. Not radically different like the GameCube controller but something at least.,4,1,2019-2-4,1,0,0
"I am an adult and play video games casually. This controller is so much easier to use and comfortable in my hands than the JoyCons that come with the Switch. The battery life is very long, around 40 hours of playtime, and I've never had it die on me. My son also uses this to play Switch games, and his smaller hands are also able to use it comfortably.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0

"The Pro Controller is a nice gaming controller but about $10-$20 to expensive.  I like using this over the Joy-Con remotes and have found the controller to be precise, comfortable, and easy to use.  I'm just not sure why Nintendo is charging so much for this controller.  I spent less on similar Wii U controller.  For families to really adopt the Switch platform, I think Nintendo needs to get the price down by the holiday season.",4,1,2017-5-2,1,0,0
Do not buy! My controller has a downward drift on the left joystick and I’m still waiting on the claim I submitted to nintendo MJ this ago. Makes the controller so frustrating it’s unusable. Very dissatisfied with this product.,1,1,2019-10-23,1,2,0
"I'm so happy I purchased this for the Nintendo Switch. I like the Joy Cons, but I wanted to test the pro controller.

I think Nothing can really beat the Wii U pro controller because it has like 70 hours of battery life. I would say that The pro controller comes a close 3rd place as nintendos best controller (2nd would obviously be the gamecube).,5,1,2019-9-24,1,0,0

"Fantastic controller, copies king of console controller design with offset analog sticks, but missing something that limits Nintendo Switch overall...a headphone jack on controller for docked play.

"The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is nearly perfect, but it has some down sides the d-pad and no analog triggers. I love everything about this controller, it's such a perfect gamepad and would almost be better than the Xbox 360 if it weren't for the lack of analog triggers. The d-pad sucks but so do most so I can let that slide but I just I wished this controller was analog.",4,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
If you like the other game systems controllers then you will definitely like this controller.  Has built in rumble and is easy to recharge or you can play while it is charging.  I use it over the supplied controllers exclusively.,5,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
absolute must buy for the switch.  the joy con things are fine.  but when it comes to fine tuned movements like shooting arrows in Zelda - BotW you are going to see a huge difference here than if you used the little paddle controllers.,5,1,2017-7-8,1,3,0

"LOVE the new switch controllers. I swear, they’re even better than both the Xbox and Playstation controllers I’ve used in the past.

Glad I bought one for both my girlfriend and I :)",5,1,2019-4-16,1,0,0

"Yes, it is expensive but I have adult-sized hands and playing on the smaller controller was giving me cramps. This is perfect sized and felt like a PS3 controller, but for a Switch. Just pay it.

"Must-have for using my switch when it's on the base. I'm not a fan of using the Switch Controllers alone, or in one of the controller holders. These are pricey but they are very sturdy, and hold a charge for a LONG time.",5,1,2018-1-31,1,2,0
this is a steal. cheaper than best buy. too bad they had a promotion going on the next day i ordered. But still. it's only 5 dollar difference and i really think it's worth it if you are playing Zelda like i do.,5,1,2018-12-14,1,1,0
"Feels good, works good. only slight issue i don't like is the triggers, in inner edge of the triggers on the side facing you when you hold them are raised and the edge along that raised area is a little thin and with my big hands it can rub a blister on your finger if you're using the trigger a lot repeatedly.",5,1,2019-1-28,1,0,0
"Right shoulder button only works like 70% of the time, really unfortunate. I've tried blowing into the space underneath it and updating the controllers software in the system settings, nothing works.If you can get one that actually works, it feels nicer than using the Joycons in the holder dock thing.",2,1,2019-7-9,1,0,0
"This controller allows me to unleash my full potential and enables me to dominate my enemies in super smash bros. My rage knows no bounds and my finger’s lightning reflexes are on par with the controllers own super thinking mega awesome feel good gripping button sensitivity.

"I was at first skeptical about how much this cost compared to if it would be comfortable, and I had no way to test this controller before I bought it.

If you need a controller for the switch and you can afford it, get this controller.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"This controlleris heavy which I can appreciate.  The button input is smooth and quiet--no 'clicking', which I also appreciate.  it has a nice wide frame for my hands and feels comfortable for hours of play.  It takes no effort to recharge and can be used even while charging.  it can even be used while charging from an external source (i.e. not directly connected to the Nintendo Switch).  A must buy for any Switch owner!",5,1,2019-3-10,1,1,0
"My husband wanted a good sized controller for his switch. The joy cons aren't really comfortable for him to use because they're just so tiny, even with the special holder they come with. This controller feels very similar to an Xbox controller. It fits his adult hands comfortably so he can play his switch.",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
This is almost a perfect controller.Almost. I had a pairing issue when I first opened it but after a unpair and repair it's works marvelously. My only small gripes are with longer gaming sessions is the grips can get a little slippery. But maybe that's just my hands. Also if the switch isn't on but any buttons are being pressed/held then it will continually try to sync with the console. Which uses battery. I left mine in a bag for a week and when I used it again it was on low battery. No worries though. Charges in about 2 hours even when in use.  Definitely would recommend.,4,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"While it is a bit pricey, I feel that this controller is well worth it, especially for games like Zelda.  The analog sticks are much more precise (the are also taller, which helps).  And it feels great in your hands.The original Switch controllers are great for my little ones (little hands, little controllers work great for Mario Kart).  But this controller is perfect for me.",5,1,2017-5-8,1,2,0
"Best controller for Nintendo and very close to my favorite Xbox 360 controller. It's an extra $10 more then the average controller currently, but well worth the price. Its priced higher due to the advance rumble, NFC, and the motion control that's added to the controller with the standard buttons. There are no trigger button that you also see in the PS4 or Xbox controller. BEWARE that this is $70 and because its limited, scalper will make it higher.",5,1,2017-3-14,1,0,0
"I got this to play Smash Bros since the joy cons are a huge pain to use. It's comfortable and works great. The battery life also seems really good and lasts through multiple long gaming sessions. Highly recommend, especially if you aren't a fan of using the joy cons for everything.",5,1,2019-5-20,1,0,0
I refused to buy this controller for a year or more because for the price it looked far less quality than other console controllers. When one came up on sale and I had some credit I decided to give it a try. I'm super happy with this controller. It's far higher quality than the pictures make it look. It has a nice heft and feels good in hand. I wish I wouldn't have waited so long to get one.,5,1,2019-4-16,1,0,0
It stays charged for a long time.  And I love the way it feels. I'm glad I finally got one. It feels really sturdy too like you could use it as a weapon against burglars. But seriously its a pretty nice controller you can use on steam games on pc too.,5,1,2019-5-23,1,0,0
This controller just feels really well made. It’s comfortable and the controls are well placed. The battery lasts approximately one half of the age of the universe. It pairs easily and stays paired. Using it to turn on the switch actually works every time.Worth it.,5,1,2018-12-14,1,0,0
It's worth every penny. No input lag or deadzones. Motion controls are instant and snappy. I've only used it in Splatoon 2 so far but it's improved my game play drastically. Highly recommend. I wouldn't bother with a knock off. Just buy the real deal cause you won't regret it.,5,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0

"Personal preference, but I did not like how it felt to use. The joycons were better. However, after a year or two of regular use the left joycon suffered from a downward drift. This feels allot more substantial and will hopefully hold up better.",4,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0
"Bought this for my son for Christmas, he loves it. I have also used it and have a hard time going back to the joy-cons after usythe pro controller. If I needed another control for the Switch I would by ano, it makes playing Smash Bros and other games so much easier.",5,1,2019-3-26,1,0,0
"I thought the Pro Controller was a bit pricey but MAN is it worth it, it's one of the best controllers I've ever owned. It feels great to use and has a really solid design, plus the D-Pad actually works which makes it perfect for fighting games too (something not many controllers handle very well anymore, sadly). But the fact that you can also sync it to Bluetooth really takes it over the top. And the battery life is ridiculous, I haven't had to recharge it since I got it. I wish the Joy Cons lasted as long as this thing does! I can't recommend it enough.",5,1,2017-9-8,1,2,0
I think this pro controller is perfect with its bigger buttons and an actual d pad along with a comfortable grip opposed to the littlw joycon grip.

"I held off on buying this controller for a while because the regular Joy-cons were great for Mario Odyssey and Mario Kart. I realized I was putting a little too much stress on them later on in games like Stardew and Smash where you are constantly moving/attacking.This controller completely changed that. It’s very sturdy and easy to use. I’ve barely used the Joy-cons, unless a game requires them, since I purchased it. It will definitely improve your experience on the Switch, especially with the retro Nintendo Online games. It’s worth the money!",5,1,2019-7-1,1,0,0

"This feels amazing and a massive improvement over the controller config from the original switch packaging.  It most certainly is not worth the 70 bucks it costed a while ago OR the 55 I paid for it. For a controller, a good one but it's still JUST a controller, it should have either come included with the switch for a bit more money OR it should only be worth maybe 40 to 50 MAX.",4,1,2018-8-14,1,0,0

"I don't know if mine is defective, but very frequently when I flick the stick or even just let go of it after holding it all the way in one direction, it inputs the direction opposite to what I was holding when I let go and it snaps back to the center.

"All around a fantastic controller. Since it arrived I've just about stopped using the joycons altogether in favor of it. It feels very comfortable in my hands and the joysticks and buttons are satisfying to use. If I was pushed to find a flaw, I'd say I wish it was a little heavier. It's a little light for my liking, but I tend to prefer heavier controllers anyway. I cannot recommend this controller enough.",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0

I've had 3. They're great until they stop working. One can no longer hold a charge and two have a right analog stick that doesn't register up consistently. Recalibrating the stick doesn't work. It's due to a common manufacturing issue with one if the components they use. There are multiple forums on this. You can tear it apart and replace the broken component but for a $70 controller that's very disappointing.,2,1,2019-7-21,1,1,0
"Overall, this is a pretty good controller. Ergonomic with a good battery life, and easy to set up. It certainly feels far better to use than two Joycons on a ""comfort"" grip. Unfortunately, the D-pad is poorly designed, and will often input the wrong direction. So I can't recommend this for anything where precision is necessary, like Tetris or NES games, but it's great for games where the D-Pad isn't essential like Smash Bros or Mario Kart. It's just unfortunate that Nintendo would get this wrong when they had this down in 1983. If they would fix this oversight, I'd consider this an excellent controller.",4,1,2019-4-12,1,0,0

All the buttons feel good. the only reason it did not get 5 out of 5 is that at the very extreme edges of the motion of the left stick, it feels like it is grinding a little bit.

Both are very convenient and well implemented, but you are going to have to pay for the luxury.",5,1,2017-4-23,1,1,0

Have had this for 3 months and still going strong. Previously had broken multiple PS4 and Xbox one controller d pads but this thing is durable. I use it on PC as well as my Switch and have to say it is the best gaming controller I’ve used.,5,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0
The joy-cons and grip that the Switch comes with are passable but not comfortable for long periods of time. This is a well-made traditional controller despite feeling sort of plasticy. The thumbstick and button response are good and the battery life is fantastic.,4,1,2018-7-1,1,0,0

"The controller feels very sturdy, and the grips are nice. It feels like a premium product—although definitely too heavy for long periods of use. The sticks have a rigid feel compared to other controllers. The face buttons are nice and large, which sort of reminds me of a Genesis controller.The huge downside is the D-pad. It is poorly designed, with zero tactile feedback and no tilt-nub in the center (you can literally press the entire D-pad down all at once), resulting in a squishy, vague sense of control. What's worse, many people (including me) have received defective D-pads, where pressing one direction will activate an adjacent direction. Instead of sending mine back for a replacement or repair (because it didn't solve the issue for many others), I opted to open up my controller and fix the issue by placing a small piece of electrical tape over part of the contact that was giving me trouble.",2,1,2017-8-26,1,4,0
The controllers I used to have were the xbox 360 and xbox one controllers that I mainly used for some PC gaming.

Seems like this would be the D-pad on a really crappy 3rd party knockoff controller — not the licensed (and irrefutably overpriced) one.I’ve been using the controller for 3 weeks.

"The left stick occasionally won't register when pushed forward. I have seen many others with this problem using this specific controller. It's unfortunate there aren't any alternative controller with motion control, because this seems to be a very common problem for what is supposed to be the ""best"" controller of the system.

"During a couple months of use, the forward sensor for the left thumb stick was failing. Instead of the hero moving at a full walk when the left thumb stick was all the way forward, the hero would move slower as if the left thumb stick was partially forward. After talking to customer support, Nintendo emailed me a shipping label with mailing instructions. 3 days later at Nintendo's expense, I had a new replacement (Nintendo had a contract repair company in the next county over.)The controller feels amazing and may be the best console controller I've ever used. Aside from questionable internal parts quality, my only complaint is the location of the D pad. The left thumb stick and D pad locations should have been swapped. The current D pad location makes it easy for the player to accidentally press diagonal up/right or diagonal up/left, which is the D pad issue people are complaining about. BTW, the controller is $10 more than the MSRP for the PS4 controller, but the PS4 controller does not come with a charge cable.",4,1,2017-12-4,1,2,0
"This controller is great until it’s not. It’s a comfortable weight, it fits your hands nicely... and then the Bluetooth stops working and the warranty sucks so it cost 75% of the cost to ship and get it repaired by Nintendo.

"Outright best Nintendo controller period.

"I bought this controller to use when my switch is docked, but unfortunately I had to return it. The controller was generally pretty good, but had in my opinion a fatal flaw: the d-pad.The d-pad is way too sensitive, and judging from many online reviews it seems like a poor design rather than a defect with my specific controller. First of all you can press the entire d-pad down from the middle, which is kind of weird because the d-pads I've seen in the past generally pivot around a center point that does not depress. But the issue is that pressing left/right buttons on the d-pad and applying even the tiniest force in the vertical axis will trigger up/down presses. There are videos of this on youtube which match my experience exactly, leading me to believe this is not just a single instance defect.",2,1,2017-12-6,1,3,0

"Was on the fence about buying a pro controller but saw a YouTube video about people’s joy-cons wearing down from sliding them on and off the Switch. Apparently the button you push in has a raised peg and sliding it on and off the metal rails of the Switch so many times wears it down and your joy-cons can slide off dropping your Switch. So I had originally opted for a second set of joy-cons instead of a pro controller so one set of joy-cons for now on will be attached to my Switch and the other set will not go back on the grip but used as two controllers sideways and I bought the pro controller so I had a controller to game on titles that need that many buttons like Zelda Breath of the Wild. The second set of joy cons charge on a slide in slide out charging dock, that don’t click into place to damage that peg connected to Joy-Con release button. The first set stays attached to my Switch and charges in the dock attached to the Switch. Mind you I know I will have to remove Joy-Cons to play for more than three people but this solution of one pro controller and two sets of Joy-Cons greatly reduces the Switching involved to wear down my Joy-Cons. By the way I’ve been playing the Switch pro controller for 4 days now about 3-5 hours a day and as of this post I still have a almost full charge, although I don’t see any drop off in battery charge icon, but it should have at least gone down a drop but if I had to estimate I’d say it’s still full charged.

Good controller if you need an extra player 2 in when playing and don’t want to use the small joy-cons. Syncs easily and battery life is very good.

It fits nicely! I also like the layout of it.",4,1,2019-3-31,1,0,0

"I like this controller a lot and is a lot more comfortable to use than the grip in most situations. My only problem is the D-Pad as it varies as to how sensitive the D-Pad registers up or down when your pressing left or right from controller to controller (For example, while I play Puyo Puyo Tetris I would ""accidentally"" quick drop a tetrimino when I just wanted to move to the right). It's like a gamble since there's a chance you'll get a really messed up D-Pad and have to send back or get it ""repaired"" when this shouldn't be an issue in the first place for a $70 controller.It can also work as a PC controller too if that interests you and are willing to pay $70 for it.",4,1,2017-4-30,1,4,0

"This is a must have for the Switch. Gaming is so much easier with the pro controller than with the LR Joy Cons that come with the system (which I find buggy). If you are a fan of the PS 4 controller, you will love the Switch's Pro. Very similar. Allows for a nice grip and easy game playing. While everyone loved the Wii's motion censored controller, I often found i buggy and that it wouldn't synchronize well. There were also so many different ways to use it that it wasn't simple enough for me. I also prefer two handed game play. The Switch's Pro Controller allows both hands on one controller, and since it isn't a motion controller like, the Wii, and doesn't have two components to it, like the Switch's Joy, you don't have the issues of synching and connectivity. It's an intuitive controller to use, as well. You don't have to ""think"" while using it.Only reason I'm docking a star is because of the price. At $69.99 I find it really expensive, especially given how poorly the Joy Cons work for games like MARIO Kart. You will want two Pros if you have that game. But that is a $140 additional investment, not to mention tax.",4,1,2017-5-2,1,0,0

"So originally I got this controller because I needed something other than the controller grip that was included with the Nintendo Switch which just wasn't cutting it for me. The Joy Cons themselves, while are impressive little controllers, can be frustrating at times due to their size and the size of the buttons being so small. This is especially apparent for games like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild where you need those precise controls in order to really take full advantage of the combat mechanics.So I bought this and I've got to say that I'm pretty impressed. First off, being someone who's always played Playstation and used to having the analog sticks being side by side,  I was worried that the directional stick layout which is very similar to Xbox One's layout, would take some time to get used to but that turned out to not be the case. Not only do they work great but I also adjusted to it very quickly and had a blast using this. The controller feels lighter than my PS4 controllers and it fits snug in my grip. It didn’t cramp up my hands like the Joy Con controller grip did. The grips have a nice texture to them that keeps them cool and easy to hold for long periods of time and with the buttons also being a lot bigger then the Joy Cons, I don't have much of an issue with hitting the wrong buttons. Also this controller is rocking a rechargeable battery that boasts a 40 hour life span on a single charge. Since I’ve gotten the controller a couple weeks ago, I’ve only had to charge it once, which is a major plus compared to other controllers like the Duelshock 4 which I’m lucky if I get a good 8 hours out of. I'd even go as far to say that the RZ & LZ trigger buttons are better than both Playstation's and Xbox's counterparts. The buttons seem to travel less distance to activate so it feels like they're responding quicker. Other pluses to this controller is that all the buttons found on the Joy Con make their way over onto this controller, it has the reader which lets you use Aiimbos with it, and its a very quick transition if you want to swap from the Joy Cons to the Pro controller during gameplay.",4,1,2018-2-6,1,2,1

"The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is a must-have accessory for anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch home console. Although expensive, it's necessary for hardcore gaming while at home, due to the Joy-Con device buttons being too small and primarily designed for handheld use instead. Although it's a step down from the previous generation (the Wii U Pro Controller took 4.5 hours to charge and lasted 80 hours total, while the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller takes 6 hours to charge and only lasts 40 hours total), the Switch Pro Controller does have additional features, like Amiibo support, motion controls and HD rumble. The position of the Control Sticks on the Switch Pro Controller actually brings back memories of the Nintendo GameCube Controller, which was designed in a similar way. Perhaps this is Nintendo's way of bringing back the GameCube fans who left for Sony and Microsoft during the Wii and Wii U eras. In any case, I highly recommend it, especially for games like Zelda, Mario Kart Deluxe and Splatoon.",5,1,2017-5-6,1,0,0

"Boy do I love this controller. I've had every controller since the NES and the Gamecube and Xbox 360 controllers were always my favorite. This has taken the cake for sure. It sits in your hands very well, all button placements feel appropriate and ergonomic. The weight or heft of the controller is perfect, a little on the heavy side but not enough to fatigue you. Sticks are fantastic, D pad is arguably the best (you may prefer the Sony style, but this is easily second to that if so). It also uses USB C to charge so you can (likely) share the cable with your phone for years to come.Only complaint I have is the price, which when you factor in the battery life, amiibo function, motion controls, is understandable but still hard to swallow when you consider the library for this controller. You'll likely only use it to play Zelda for a long while until other Switch titles start rolling out. You can be crafty and use it on your PC for sure, but it would be nice if Nintendo made it plug-n-play for PC as Microsoft has done.",5,1,2017-5-14,1,0,0

"I have two sets of joycons and a pro controller, and I really like the joycons, but if you're trying to decide between a second set and a pro controller, I'd recommend going with the pro controller. The Pro Controller is top notch. It was easy to link up with my switch, and it has become my preferred controller since I started using it. Prior to purchasing this controller I really enjoyed using the joycons with the grip, but this controller feels so much better. It fits perfectly in my hands and has been great for long gaming sessions.The battery life on it is excellent and after you're done using it, you can plug it into the wall and not have to worry about it ever running out of juice. I haven't run into any D-Pad issues that were mentioned in previous reviews, but I will update if I run into those problems.

"Until this controller is in your hands, you can't help but feel it's a waste of money- based on the pictures. But boy this is a beauty. Especially up close, it's a work of art. It feels extremely durable & very solid, it's got a nice weight to it and fits my hands perfectly. I'd go as far to say this controller is more comfortable than Xbox 1 and ps4 controllers. $70 may seem steep for a controller but let's remember there is an accurate motion sensor built into this. Plus the battery life is incredible, I've read it lasts 40 hours. I've played here and there for 2 weeks and still haven't needed to charge it.The reason I rated it 4 stars is because...well first and foremost, people don't trust 5 star reviews BUT also the controller is not very breathable. I believe it's mostly the material used for the hand-grips. So your hands will get sweaty sometimes. Nevertheless, in my opinion this controller was definitely worth the money.",4,1,2017-4-18,1,7,0

"This thing is far, far nicer to use than the Joy-Cons that come with the Switch. I have large hands, and the Joy-Cons are really not very pleasant to use, no matter whether used with the grip or not. So I picked this up to play Breath of the Wild with, and let me tell you, it is a world of difference. It's very ergonomic, the buttons and sticks are now a proper size for your fingers and feel good, and the build quality is great. Not great? The price. With both PS4 and XB1 controllers going anywhere from $40-50 at time of writing, this thing is at a minimum $30 more expensive for practically no reason. And as far as I can tell, those controllers technically have more features than this controller does (touchpad, headphone jack, big lights, etc), making the price even more disappointing. But considering it's either Joy-Cons or this, you don't have much of a choice if you want a nicer playing experience.",4,1,2017-5-4,1,1,0

"The pro controller is very good as far as controllers go. Of course the layout is very similar to an XBox controller, which I always found a let-down considering the GameCube controller was so uniquely Nintendo and also very comfortable and effective. That said, all 4 shoulder buttons are sized well and spaced out well; the trigger action on ZR and ZL are better than the PS4 and XBox controllers, in my opinion, because they provide the right amount of spring -- neither too much nor too little tension, which is what I prefer for shooters.I have 3 critiques. First, the A, B, X, and, Y buttons feel so cheap. They look generic, and there's something about how they feel when you press them that comes off as preschool-toyish. They're not terrible, but it's something I always notice. Second, the ""rumble"" feature is more like a stronger version of a cell phone's vibrator. It's just a generic, flat, buzzing feeling. Compare that to the PS4 rumble where it feels like some creature is crawling around inside your controller. Sometimes it's so jarring that I look down at the controller to see what's going on. I don't know what Sony's mechanism is, but it's more effective than Nintendo's. Third, naturally, is the price 😱 Nothing to say about that that hasn't already been said.",4,1,2018-6-20,1,0,0

"I ordered this controller to have a second one so that my husband and I don’t have to share Joy-Con controller halves, which get uncomfortable after long-time play. It is very comfortable to hold, though after getting used to the Joy-Cons in the grip, I found I had to get used to the layout of this controller all over again. It also feels like it was made for someone with large hands. I have average-sized hands, so while the controller is still perfectly usable to me, it just feels a little large. Bottom line: my husband loves having his own controller now (and prefers the feel of the Pro controller), and I usually play with the Joy-Con controller in the grip, so we are both happy.",5,1,2018-1-8,1,0,0

The charge it holds is incredible; I didn't know it had amiibo detection capabilities, but that is pretty cool, too.  I also used the C to A cable that comes with it to hook up the switch itself to an external battery pack to add another three hours or so of Zelda play when I was away from the base unit.  I have the xbox One S as well, with those cool white controllers and I love the feel of them, but this is actually a bit of a cut above those.  Like others have mentioned, this is a great controller for playing Zelda on a big screen and also is nice for Mario Kart to add a third player to the mix.  Good job, Nintendo.",5,1,2017-5-30,1,0,0

"This controller is incredibly comfortable. I was a huge fan of the Wii U pro controller and used that controller constantly. Than this controller came out and it is the best controller I have ever held. The ABXY buttons are pretty huge and oval shaped, the shoulder buttons are very ergonomic, the analog sticks have a concave design with ridges on the end for precision if you want to grip the edge of the analog stick and it is pretty heavy so it is a solid feeling controller. A pretty minor gripe I have about this controller is that the D-pad is pretty stiff. Overall with the included features of this controller, it makes the $70 price worth it.",5,1,2017-10-6,1,0,0

The analog sticks provide more movement range than the Joy-Con, the buttons are a good size larger, and the controller just feels very comfortable in your hands.

"Nice feel and it actually has some weight to it. You can tilt just like joy-cons and I actually found this controller more responsive. I like the feel way better than the joy-cons in the grip. I will be buying these as opposed to additional joy-cons just because the overall cost for joy-cons along with charging grip is much higher than this controller. Comes with the charging cable that plugs into any available base USB port. Could probably charge using any standard USB charging system, but have not tried it yet. Played Zelda for 5hrs and it performed flawlessly. Highly recommended!",5,1,2017-4-16,1,0,0

"This is a great controller. It has a roughly 40 hour battery life, it is far and away a better experience than using the Joy-cons on the comfort grip or by themselves, and it feels very sturdy and well made. It is very reminiscent of an Xbox controller and I really prefer using it for Zelda while I'm playing on my television.Overall I really like the controller but I just don't see why it is more expensive than a dual shock 4 or Xbox One controller.  Maybe considering the battery last much longer and it has NFC for the Amiibo figures but I just didn't see $70 here. While I can recommend it since it is a great controller and currently is the only option besides the Joy-con controller I can't recommend these scalped and inflated prices that you see while stock is limited. If you can find it for $70 and you really wanted the full controller like I did, then go ahead and get it otherwise it may be worth it to see the other options coming out in the next few months.",4,1,2017-3-15,1,1,1

"If you own a Nintendo Switch make your self the favor and buy a Switch Pro Controller, its the most pleasant controller I've ever held in my hand - yes I mean it feels better than holding an Xbox One controller.

"+It's very comfortable to hold and feels substantial in your hands. I want to stress how solid this controller feels and the build quality behind it. I can twist the grips pretty aggressively and they don’t give or make noise. In comparison Sony and Microsoft’s controllers creak and feel like they’ll break from noticeably thinner and weaker plastic.+The analog sticks are very comfortable, have little friction, and the edges have a nice grippy pattern. After 2000 hours of Splatoon 2 the analog sticks return to neutral and there’s no wobbling or drifting. The sticks do rub against the sides though and will produce some plastic dust. One disappointing problem I ran into was occasionally the right stick would register a click despite not being pressed down.",3,1,2017-5-24,1,7,0

"Let me say right away that this thing is 5 stars for every single reason other than price. I only put it at 4 because the price point for this thing is so ridiculous at $70. It honestly feels better in the hand than my PS4 controller does (the handles are a bit straighter and narrower) and Nintendo really needs to think about including one of these with the console. The battery in it is also phenomenal, as a single charge seems to last for weeks of standby and play. It's silly that you have to buy this thing in the first place, and sadly because of it's high price, I feel that few will get to experience the joy of playing with this. It really made my Switch feel more like a proper home console than the Joy Con did. I actually play it way more on the TV now than I did previously, and it's made me download a lot more of the indie games to play on the TV as well. Overall it's fantastic and I would say every switch owner really deserves one; it's unfortunate Nintendo priced it so very few will be willing to shell out the money for it.",4,1,2018-3-13,1,5,0

The Xbox One controller is widely regarded as the pinnacle of gaming controllers, and this Switch controller one is very similar, so it's quite easy to make the transition.One thing that sets the experience apart from using the joy cons is the placmeent of the + and - keys, as they are much easier to each. The shoulder buttons are also much more solid.",5,1,2018-4-19,1,0,0

"No complaints here. Ergonomics are fine, buttons are responsive and reasonably stiff, motion controls work well, solidly built. Minor quibbles are the minus button being hard to get with it's location past the left stick, and the usage of a USB-C connector instead of much more common UBS-micro and mini connectors. It may be expensive but if you're finding the Joy Cons to be small and flimsy, especially if you have larger hands, this will save the day and you'll be glad you spent the money for a legit, serious gaming pad.",5,1,2017-4-3,1,1,0

"An absolutely necessity if you plan on doing some serious gaming. It's sneaky good- I have big hands and my girlfriend has tiny hands, and it seems like it was made to fit both of our hands perfectly. It's lightweight yet sturdy, has a good grip, responsive buttons and the motion controls are tight. It gets a TON of play time on a single charge and charges up really fast with any USB-C charger.  It might be off putting to spend the extra money on a separate controller, but it's worth every penny.",5,1,2018-1-23,1,0,0

The one disappointment - and it's a super minor one - is that there's no analog shoulders, which just tells me Super Mario Sunshine on Switch Virtual Console might not happen :)",5,1,2017-4-22,1,2,0

"This is the most comfortable option for playing Nintendo Switch. The Pro Controller is very ergonomic. The battery is rechargeable, and comes with the necessary USB cord for charging purposes. It can be plugged directly into the gaming system, or you can use any other USB charging plug. The box indicates that the controller battery can stay charged for up to 40 hours of gameplay, and so far it seems to be living up to that promise. I have had this item for almost a week, and I have not had to recharge it yet. I'm very happy with the Pro Controller, and it is definitely worth the money.",5,1,2017-4-26,1,1,0

The game controller is ok it’s part of the magic that makes the Switch the Switch but for playing the game through the TV it’s nicer to have a beefier quicker responding controller. I also like the fact that it can be recharged and that it lets you know when it’s time to recharge.

"Solid controller, but without a doubt overpriced, the value just isn't there, with no headphone connectivity and the lack of analog triggers... it just doesn't live up to similar controllers by MS or Sony, or the ergonomics of the current Xbox One controller.

"I bought this to play Celeste (which is an amazing game!!) because the joycons weren't up to the job (the joysticks were mis-calibrated and you can't really use the buttons as a dpad).Unfortunately the dpad is unusable. Every other press goes in the wrong direction. For example, you hang on a wall and press right (into the wall) and the character goes up the wall!

There's a reason why this controller is getting sold; the joycons that come with the Switch are just not ergonomic. This one feels quality-built. It also includes a USB-C cable and supports NFC and motion control. I would say it's worth the price.,5,1,2018-1-7,1,0,0

"Nintendo got the design of this controller right. It feels very balanced and comfortable. It has some similarities with the XB360/XB1 controller shape, so if you're used to that, this will feel pretty familiar. Construction quality is very good, too. It doesn't feel cheap. It's worth the money, so long as you're not buying it from some jerk who has spiked the price due to availability issues.I don't know that I'd say this is a must-have for the Switch, because in my opinion the grip for the joycons is pretty good too, but this is definitely much more comfortable. It's not a bad idea to get the pro controller if you're going to be doing a fair bit of gameplay on your TV rather than using the Switch mobile.",5,1,2017-4-20,1,2,0

"The pro controller is a very good buy and, if you're looking for an extra controller, I'd recommend forgoing another pair of joycons and getting this one instead. It's quality is great and competes well with even Xbox or PS4 controllers, though it doesn't win against them.",4,1,2017-6-14,1,0,0

Whenever I press down on the d-pad and move my finger a little to the right or left, it would go in those directions instead of the down input and it does feel kinda cheap.

Also pay attention to the left and right grips, feel the straight edge where they connect to check if they are flush/even with the controller.

"Now I Understand why the High Price. This is heavy an well build, to me it feels better than my xbox one controller. The Pro Controller Includes motion controls, HD rumble and built-in amiibo functionality. The Controller connects with PCs, Mac computers, and Android mobile devices and it works out of the box. iOS uses its own Bluetooth controller specification which means it does not work natively with the Joy-Con or Switch Pro controller. 👍",5,1,2017-3-23,1,6,0
A must if you are playing the switch on the tv. It makes it much more convenient to actually switch from tablet to TV and back to tablet if you don't need to remove the joy cons from the tablet each time. It also works with amiibos and feels very similar to an xbox controller.,5,1,2017-5-13,1,0,0

I generally play on xbox and i have big hands. Using the joycons i dont have much problems but at times the shorter sticks give me problems. This is a very close feel to an xbox controller. The ZL and ZR triggers and not as pronounced as xbox's controller but it still has a good feel in your hands.

"Pro controller is overpriced but a MUST have.  I received the Pro on launch day so I can't compare to the joy cons as some people say the joy cons are great. But the Pro feels solid and fits in the hands very well.  The bottoms and sticks are responsive and appear to be durable.  The build and durability are huge with a controller this expensive.  I'm optimistic that it will last and the heft price tag won't be that bad after all.

You also can't beat the 40 hour rated battery life, as well as the included high quality USB-c to USB-a cable.

The controller is a tad expensive, but since I primarily play on my TV, I already feel like it's worth the money I've spent. Compared to just the joycons, the buttons, sticks, and triggers are much more comfortable, particularly the size of the buttons and the placement of the the sticks. If I had to rank controllers, it would be among the top, or at the very least above the WiiU pro and GameCube controllers.

The slightly larger buttons was a little odd at first but they also have a good feel to them. All the shoulder buttons also have a really great feel to them, all four are digital (you don't need analog triggers as much as you think you do) and the ZL & ZR buttons have an ever so slight give to them, they are easy to reach and comfortable with using either one or two fingers grip style. The gyroscope works really well with Splatoon 2 (global testfire tested).The only thing I can state as a potential weak point (besides my personal preference of top side analog sticks) is that the d-pad is quite firm, and isn't as nice to use as a primary character input as the Wii U Pro Controller's. But it's still better than most other d-pads.",5,1,2017-3-25,1,5,0
"I'm used to regular controllers. Xbox One mostly... When getting the switch the joy con controllers just bother me.

Sure I'd love to save some money, but for comfort and getting something I know I'm used to better its worth it. I didn't pre order this with the console so when I heard about it I was in panic trying to find it. I ended up getting it after I got my console in just on a whim of looking at the time.

It is possible to hold down one direction on the d-pad an push it in such a way that you can trigger both adjacent directions. Not only that, but if you really want  to, you can trigger the opposite direction on the d-pad.

Button clicks not as satisfying vs joycons as it does not have an actuation ""click,"" where Joycons behave like MX Blue switches and the Pro Controller behaves like a MX Red.

"I am on my third controller now and all of them have D-Pad issue. When I press left or right on the D-Pad, I would get up instead of right or left. I've used the Input Test on the System Settings to confirm. Now what happens with the D-Pad is if you hold a direction and then shift or roll your thumb perpendicular to that direction the input changes. It also happens when if I press the a direction off center. The issue is the same for all three controllers, I returned the two previous ones. I have to keep this third controller but I am thinking of returning it, I just can't play with the joycons. They are less precise and the Switch Pro Controller is really great for the Breath of Wild. The Pro controller helped me beat so many Lynels in BotW but it also cause me to die in the game. I would be in the middle of a fight with a Silver Lynel and my sword breaks. I press right on the D-Pad to quickly change to another weapon but I get the runes instead. I press two more times and I get the runes both times. Then I die from its AOE blast. It is very annoying when that happens. I don't have the game Puyo Puyo Tetris yet but people on forums have written that's impossible to play with the Pro's D-Pad. I don't think the majority of the people have noticed this problem or maybe they think that they only pressed the wrong button while playing. I want to love this controller but D-Pad issue is a big deal breaker for me. Could it be bad luck and I just got three bad controllers in row? I read on a forum about other people returning their controllers and still having the same issue with the replacements. Some have sent theirs for repairs and still have the issue. I don't know if I can justify the $70 price tag now with this D-Pad issue.If you have read this review, please test out your controllers in System Settings.",1,1,2017-3-28,1,3,0

"I bought one of these locally at Wal-Mart with my first Nintendo Switch since given away. I am buying another Switch for myself and I'll buy another Pro Controller (on Amazon because they're cheaper than WalMart) but I was looking to see what third party controllers have come out since I last looked.For the most part, I still think this is the best wireless controller for the Nintendo Switch. The only one close to it is the PowerA one. The PowerA wireless controller is very comparable though and has different features that I feel most gamers would use. By this I mean the back customizable buttons and the option to use rechargable batteries instead of needing to charge the controller through USB-C. That being said, I feel more comfortable buying the ""Official"" one made and sold by Nintendo.

"Before you even consider buying one of these, Google ""Switch Pro Controller Left Joystick Drift"" (you won't need to type much since it's a top fill result...). I've now bought 2 of these, got them in, charged them and started playing with them and both had terrible left joystick drift down and to the left, enough to turn my character around and make me start walking that direction 25% of the time when I let go of the left joystick. These were both brand new. Googling the issue and hoping it was just a calibration thing or something, it's clear Nintendo used faulty equipment in the Pro controller, and it seems to be specifically bad on the left joystick. Now I get to return another one. These are $70, the most expensive game controller short of the Pro controllers on XB/PS, and there's absolutely nothing ""pro"" about them - no extra features, no modifiable button distances, and apparently no quality control. There are years and years of results about this, and things have only gotten worse since it seems they're shipping broken out of the box equipment now. Nintendo only puts a 90 day warranty on these, which clearly means they know they're garbage and don't stand behind their hardware at all. I'm extremely disappointed, and done with Nintendo brand accessories. If I'm going to get faulty trash, I may as well buy 3rd party for 1/3 of the money. By the way, after 3 months, Nintendo will charge you $50 to ""fix"" your faulty controller, and ship you back another faulty piece a month later. They've known they're faulty for years and continue using the same known-bad switches and sensors. Avoid at all costs.",1,0,2020-4-18,1,2,0
"I bought this controller as I loved the look of the controller when I saw it online and after seeing it in person, I knew I had to have this controller. People say the grip is Pink but to me it is more of a Red shade than Pink. This controller truly is one of the best I've ever used on any console. I own an Xbox One and PS4 as well, but the thing with the this Nintendo Switch Pro Controller the weight and Resistance on the joysticks just feel right (The weight especially). The only part of the controller that might seem a little off is the massive d-pad, but you get used to it quickly and it's very responsive. The main thing where this controller kills its competitors is the battery life. I've used this controller now for 20 hours and there is still at least half of the battery life left, that is astounding. It's also great that this controller charges using USB-C as you have so many options for charging.I decided to buy this limited edition controller as I also bought the limited edition version of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and the thought of having a matching controller considering the price difference between this and the regular Pro Controller was too small to pass up. Overall I wish it were a little cheaper (The Pro Controller in General) but it is what it is, with the amount of gaming I'm going to get out of this thing for the life of the Console, it'll be worth it :)",5,0,2017-12-8,1,8,1
"The left joystick on the controller i just received is not working properly. I can move the joystick in any direction just fine, but the characters in the game are not responding the same in each direction pressed. For example I can be moving Rex (from Xenoblade) in almost any direction and he runs just fine, but when I push the joystick to the left he slows down to a walk. I can be moving him an any direction but when I want him to go left, he barely moves. My original pro controller works just fine, but the Xenoblade one I just received; the joystick's inputs are not working correctly.",2,1,2017-12-10,1,3,0
"The controller feels fantastic in your hands.  This is especially apparent after trying to use the tiny joycons with their even tinier buttons and joysticks.  If your an adult with moderate to large hands you need this controller.  Playing games like Resident Evil 5 or Doom feel worlds better with a controller that is designed for hands larger than a 10 year old's.  Using the controller mount for the joycons is not a substitute for a pro controller.  After using the pro controller, you realize that the joycon's tiny buttons, joysticks, and shoulder buttons are things you tolerate.  Even if you decide against buying this controller (most likely due to the price), buy a cheaper third party traditional controller.  Comfort - 10/10The buttons are large, which I love, reminding more of the larger buttons seen on the original SNES controller.  The buttons along with the D-pad have a matte finish that feel great.  A special mention of the D-pad must be made.  This D-pad feels fantastic.  Compared to the 8bitdo SN30 pro, it is NO CONTEST.  The D-pad for Nintendo's pro controller is top of the line and blows the third party D-pads out of the water.  The Joysticks feel good, maybe even great.  They have raised edges with ridges for increased grip which feel good on your thumbs.  I still prefer the concave shape of the Xbox One joysticks but the switch pro controller joysticks are comfortable, responsive, and accurate.  Compared to the Wii U pro controller, the joysticks feel less sturdy though.  The Wii U pro controller feel sturdy and require more effort to move them, which I like.  This is not a big deal but I feel some may not like joysticks that have less resistance. Buttons and Joysticks - 9/10",4,0,2020-6-19,1,0,1

Do you enjoy playing Breath of the Wild, trying to quickly switch to a different weapon and then accidentally opening runes for the millionth time because the D-Pad is such an abomination? If yes, then this is the controller for you. I really hope whoever designed this turd is in a hole somewhere crying, while feeling intense shame from making something so horrible. I genuinely hope sometime in the future Nintendo realized how awful this thing is and puts out a better controller. I've used some truly awful controllers before (Dualshock 3), but this one certainly takes the Cake. What's even more embarrassing is that something so awful didn't come from a 3rd party company like Nyko, which I've also bought some truly terrible controllers from.",1,1,2018-6-23,1,0,0
This is a great controller except for one big problem....  The Y button is stuck down.  I've only played about 60 hours with this controller and it is already broken and broke after the return policy.  So now I am stuck with an $80 (after taxes) controller that doesn't even work.  I hope they fix the problem with future controllers.,1,1,2017-4-7,1,6,0
"Docked a star for the price. Too expensive and I feel like a moron paying $70. for a controller. However it is in fact a really good controller. The Joy cons were cramping up my hands and causing my fingers to fall asleep. I have a similar experience with most handheld consoles. The pro controller is way better than the Joy cons. The buttons are bigger, there's a real d-pad, great battery life unlike the ds4 that has to be hooked up to life support when you use it. It's a sturdy controller. I also had the Wii U with it's pro controller and I did not like it. I preferred and used the gamepad over the Wii U pro controller. The buttons on this one are properly placed unlike the wii u controller which had the buttons and d-pad where Sony puts there analog sticks. One of the best things about this controller is I know longer have to feel like I'm playing with transformers before I sit down to play on the TV. I can just dock the whole system, pick up the pro controller and get to gaming. No pain either. Yay. Wish I could've had a proper controller in the box. Nintendo likes to over think things a lot. There thoughts must keep them up at night just like me. Lol.",4,0,2017-9-2,1,2,0
"All in all it is a decent controller, and I strongly prefer it over the joy-cons which just don't feel very good.My main beef with this controller is the D-pad. The D-pad on my controller had a tendency to register left/right as up button presses if there is ANY amount of ambiguity in where you pressed. This makes playing a few games very annoying (puyo puyo tetris for example). The solution that I've found to this is to open up the controller and place a small piece of electrical tape in the center of the D-pad contact points on the circuit board so that they are covered about a third of the way. This is not terribly difficult, and guides can be found online. If you do not feel comfortable making this change, then I would say avoid this controller. A guide for the fix can be found with some googling.",4,0,2017-9-8,1,2,0
"FULL DISCLOSURE: I paid for this with my own funds and am giving solely my opinions in this review.I have had this controller since I got my Switch in Dec 2017 and have used it extensively since. I have played upwards of 60 hours of Mario Kart and 25 hours of Rocket League as well as my other games almost exclusively with this controller and can say that it is without a doubt responsive, comfortable, and worth every cent.

"I gave this as a gift to my cousin because she was using the switch joycons with the joycon grip for the last couple of years.  She puts in hundreds of hours playing games on the switch and was comfortable using the joycons.  Little did she know that the Pro Controller is WELL WORTH THE INVESTMENT! She said it took some getting used to from using the joycons because it felt a bit bigger but once she got used to it, she realized she was missing out BIG TIME! She was super happy with my gift to her.It may seem pricey but that's what great controllers cost!  Think about the PS4 controller.  Those things run around $70-$80.  It's definitely worth it.  I have my own Pro Controller as well and I have to say it's my #1 choice over any other controller for the switch!",5,0,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"The controller was nice at first. Everything working well. Im a light casual gamer on my switch (maybe 3 to 4 hours a week). Short story, i got this controller from target. After about 5 months, the controller started drifting via my left joy stick. I looked it up on google and surely enough, plenty of people had the same issue as I. I tried calibrating, changing grip order, blowing air, etc. Pretty much everything except taking it apart. It keeps drifting no matter what. A little disappointed that this controller does this. My old xbox controllers of 2 years is still working strong whereas this less than a year controller is already dying on me. The controller itself seems cheap despite it's good looks and price point. So just a cautionary tale. Really disappointed.",2,0,2020-9-14,1,0,0
Big step down from wiiu pro. Too big. Triggers too small. Only one color and the splatoon one looks dumb. Works with bluetooth but cant be used to play anything on pc i tyed and it wont but my wiiu pro does. The worst nintendo controller ever made. Not worth the price by far.

Very disappointed....At a cost of $70.00 this lasted me all of 5 weeks.....I found it very easy to use....being a Grandma with arthritis....I really enjoy my Switch with this controller.....but the games I play use the left joy stick most of the time and now it does not work like it should....when I try to scroll through a menu and I stop at the spot I want...it just keeps going and going....and my characters don't seem to move like they should....I might have expected something like this from a cheap knock off....but come on Nintendo!!!  it is a waste of money...UPDATE 1/2/19...I sent it back to nintendo and when I got it back they said nothing wrong with it...and lo and behold it worked fine...then about a month ago it started doing the same thing and then the dpad stopped working like it should and I very seldom use it...called nintendo today told me to gently use a toothbrush around the dpad and joy stick...which I did while talking to him...did not help....it will cost me $40 plus I have to pay for shipping...I told him i paid $70 for this and now another $50 is a real rip off....I guess they know they aren't going to last hence the only 90 day warranty...needless to say I am not sending it back...if I do get another one I will get it from best buy and get the extended warranty since Amazon doesn't offer an extended warranty...,1,0,2018-3-5,1,3,0

"Is this seriously the d-pad that Nintendo expects people to play VC/retro games on?  This is worse than Xbox's!I've been through 3 of these controllers, and there are countless other people with the same complaints online, so I know this isn't just a defective issues, it's a design flaw.  The moment I started using one of these controllers, I immediately noticed that the d-pad is somewhat stiff, has an awkward amount of travel and is slow to pop back.  Even worse, when pressing a direction, it is easy to accidentally press one of the adjacent directions unintentionally.  This is mildly annoying in Zelda (where it will simply bring up the incorrect quick select menu, or call your horse), but it's a HUGE issues on Puyo Puyo Tetris (where it will quick drop your piece before you've got it positioned right).",2,0,2017-6-7,1,3,0
"Amazing controller- no doubt about it. The analogues, face buttons, bumpers and triggers are all solid, it features gyro and joycon HDRumble, and it works on PC via bluetooth. You noticed I didn't mention the dpad. It's dreadful.I bought it, like everyone else, to play Switch games on a traditional controller. It's perfect for any 3D games from Zelda to Mario Kart. Again, perfect. But for 2D games like Shovel Knight, Blaster Master, Gunvolt and Kamiko? Forget about it. The problem is it registers an other direction easily while pressing a different one; hold left and it'll press just enough towards up or down to make it sense up and or down are being pressed. Same for right, and up+down to left and right. You'll make tons of mistakes on dpad intense games that require perfect precision. Can't imagine playig Ninja Gaiden with it.",4,0,2017-7-26,1,1,0
"The controller was great when I first got it. Much better than using the joy-cons. Around 6 months into owning the pro controller, the joysticks started sticking slightly causing characters to spin in a circle. The problem was correctable at first but would happen every few days. Now the sticks are at a point where they are so loose they get stuck to one side and it's impossible to get them back in line. The bottom line is Nintendo needs to figure out how to make these from higher quality materials at the prices they are charging for them. With normal use, I'd expect they could last longer than 6 months.",1,0,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"Unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is a roll of the dice as to whether you will get one in good working condition or not. For many people, the D-pad has significant problems under the hood, such as if you press up, the left and right arrows might also get activated. Nintendo was not helpful with replacing my broken controller (and I unfortunately did not purchase it on Amazon), so I have had to do some tinkering inside the controller.In addition to the gamble D-pad, this controller just feels cheap. The triggers don't have a nice feel to them, very plastic-y and light. And the ABXY buttons can develop a click to them after a short amount of use.",3,0,2019-2-18,1,0,0
"As I said I really like this controller in general. It fits nicely in my hands and it functions much better than the joycons. The biggest problem I have with this controller is the drifting.

I cannot tell you how irritating it is to be on the side of the cliff or in the middle of a battle and you character just decides to start walking off a cliff on its own or wandering. I have already had to buy a second one with less than a year of use.

Tldr: The Nintendo switch pro controller is an absolute must have if you play fast paced games with camera controls such as doom. But only gets 4 stars because of the price and lack of 3.5mm jack.I've had the switch since launch day and have been in love with the joycons from the start. As soon as doom came I quickly realized the down side of the joycons.

"If you're like me, and plan to play games connected to the TV exclusively, you need this controller. There's nothing bad to say about the controller itself, it's terrific. It feels great in the hand, the buttons have that perfect feel to them, the layout is just about perfect and the battery charge lasts forever. Well, technically about 40 hours, and that's very impressive.The only thing preventing me from giving this 5 stars? The price... It's absurd. Honestly, this should have been packaged with the console, as the joycons make terrible controllers for play off the TV. The buttons are too small and the grip just isn't comfortable for long periods. So yeah, including this in the box would have been ideal, but this is Nintendo. At the very least, this controller should be priced at around $39... maybe $49, but that's pushing it to me. But $70??? Come on Nintendo, even you know that's ridiculous.",4,0,2017-10-19,1,1,0

"So I got this as a gift.  The overall controller feels good.  It's a good external design except for the + and - buttons.  On the Joy Cons they have a distinctive shape and are both placed very far apart from the home button and screen capture button.  But on the Pro controller they are both round, flat, and right next to nearly identical buttons.  You'll be accidentally pressing the home button and taking screen captures a lot with this controller.  The placement of the - button is too close to the left analog stick as well.  I'm constantly bumping it.  I'm not happy with this cramped button placement at all.My first big issue with the controller started just a few months after I got it.  The left analog stick stopped registering when I'd push it up and to the left or right while playing, everything else worked fine.  I've never seen this kind of issue with any other controller.  Thankfully Nintendo replaced it for me but then All the buttons including the D-pad would act like I was holding down the input when I had only tapped it.  I did some trouble shooting over the phone with Nintendo and amazingly pressing the sync button on top of the controller fixed this new problem.",2,0,2018-1-25,1,0,0
"The Switch Pro Controller was announced to be $70, when you can regularly find the PS4 controller and Xbone controller for $40. I was hesitant to pull the trigger, but when I got my Switch and it became clear that it would become my primary gaming system, I decided to buy it. The 40 hours of battery life, HD rumble and motion controls were the biggest selling points for me; I hate the terrible battery life of my PS4 controller and my Xbone controller is boring.Immediately, the Pro Controller came off as more comfy than the other two big controllers. The analog sticks are perfect, the shoulder buttons are perfect, but the D-pad is occasionally finicky; it often registers an Up press when I'm trying to hold Right to switch weapons in BOTW. The battery life is bonkers, one charge lasts me about a week(I have to charge my PS4 controller every day that I use it). The motion controls rule in games like Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart 8. HD rumble is disappointing, though; just feels slightly better than regular vibration, definitely overhyped.",5,0,2017-11-10,1,0,0
"I have 4 of these in different game-release colors. They're great controllers, the only better ones I have used is the Xbox Elite series, and outside the awesome paddle buttons on the Elite 2, the difference is negligible. One thing that bothered me was that my thumbs often slipped around on the sticks, hurting my performance in tight situations in Mario Kart or FPS. I got some skateboard grip tape here on AMZN and put little circles in the center of the sticks and it's GREAT. I strongly recommend giving this a shot if you ever feel your thumbs slipping!",5,0,2020-6-17,1,0,1
"Pros: Long battery life, ergonomic, didn't have any issues in regards to connectivity/range.Cons: Like all of Nintendo's controllers this Gen, the left joystick slowly becomes entirely unresponsive in directions or drifts making it useless.  My pro controller worked great for 12 months, then slowly started having issues escalating from minor/not too noticeable to unusable over the next 6 months.

"I don't understand how this controller has such rave reviews... I picked it up this morning and was excited to finally have a controller for my switch and utilize it while docked. But when I unboxed the controller like alot of people have said the right side grip was not properly aligned which made a slight sharp edge on the back side of the controller when gripped but nothing EXTREME, and brushed it off. But I purchased it with Crash Bandicoot in hopes to revisit the game with my wife. IMMEDIATELY noticed a huge input lag. For those who don't know what that is, a short and sweet explination is when you press a button it takes about a half a second before the console registers the pressing of said button. So in a game like Crash Bandicoot where you have to time jumps and movements perfectly, it made the game impossible. I immediately boxed it back up and returned to my local Target. For anyone who enjoys precise movement and commands. Or maybe playing a game where it isn't as important (which there isn't really one) this controller is clearly not worth the hefty price tag.",1,0,2019-2-24,1,0,0
I got a $40 gift card for best buy and used it to buy this and price matched with Amazon to only pay about $20 of my own money for the controller. And I gotta say it's far better than the joycons. While I don't mind the joycons at all and think they are perfectly fine in handheld mode but for docked play the pro controller is better. The buttons and analog sticks are bigger and it has a traditional d-pad (which never bothered me but I know for a lot of people it's a big deal.) It's more comfortable to hold than the joycon grip that comes with the console and the Power A comfort grip. I just hope I have better luck with it lasting than some of the other reviews I've read about this controller.

"There is absolutely no question that Nintendo has done it again, with the way we play video games thanks to the Nintendo Switch. Overall, they have been a defiant influence for generation on how we play favorites like Super Mario 64 and The Legend Of Zelda.

The new Nintendo Switch Pro Controller feels comfortable, and works very nicely as a second controller if you want to play against your friends in challenging titles like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or digital titles like Fast RMX. It works very flawlessly with the Nintendo Amiibo figures for great additions to playing your favorite games. The disadvantage with the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is that it is more expensive in price than Nintendo's earlier controllers had shown for the previous systems.

Probably 30% of the time, when you hit the down button you also hit the left and right along with it.  There is simply no way that this is a fair asking price for these two unacceptable flaws with a controller. Also, The gyroscope is nice, but it isn't as responsive as the joycons themselves.It's hard to fully recommend this.  Would I have bought it again despite the cost?

"Apparently a bad manufacturer (really a vendor) defect. The vendor supplied joysticks (ALPS, same company has supplied thumbsticks for Xbox and PS as well) for this controller that have a lot of plastic parts, and insufficient lubrication. So before long you’ll notice the thumbsticks make really loud squeaks and may even have difficulty physically returning to center. In this case you’ll need to contact Nintendo for repair or replacement as it’s not a case of you dirtying the controller, is the various plastic pieces that make up the gimbal rubbing against each other without enough lubricant - your DIY options are severely limited (disassemble most of the controller and apply cooking oil via Q-tip or similar lubricant, automotive or o-ring silicon grease would probably work great, to the gimbal joints underneath the thumb pad) as the thumbsticks don’t disassemble once soldered onto the controller board. ALPS seems somewhat to blame here, but they also make thumbsticks with metal components for other brands like Xbox. I think Nintendo got greedy and asked ALPS to quote them on a cheaper part number. For as much as you pay for the pro controller, skimping on the thumbsticks from their supplier is a really bad move. This generation of Pro Controllers as a result are probably better avoided. If you have one you’ll want a small, flat tipped Phillips screwdriver and some grease agent to try and apply extra lubricant to free up those squeaky joints.",2,0,2018-6-21,1,0,0

I'm still not fond of the layout of the 4 primary buttons, but at least I can play Mario U and Mario party with the kids now.",4,0,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"It’s fine as long as you don’t need the D-Pad. I never buy 3rd party controllers because I know nothing beats the original. When I had a Wii-U, I didn’t regret dropping the cash for a couple of pro controllers. However, this sorry excuse for a pro controller for the Switch is just utter crap. Go buy something cheaper because it’ll be a better investment than wasting your time with this piece of trash.",1,0,2019-2-19,1,0,0
This pro controller is more ergonomics than the built-in controllers that come with Nintendo Switch. My hands are not extra large but I still do not like the built-in Switch controllers.Reasons why I love Switch Pro Controller:,5,0,2017-5-19,1,0,0
"This review sits in the middle of the road because, I must say it is not a bad controller but it has one major design flaw that ruins it for me. Like most controllers, the handles are bent going outward at the ends and inward at the top. This one, it's almost just straight down grips. My huge man hands do not enjoy this one bit and I find holding this thing for long periods of time isn't great.Also that D pad, just lol.",3,0,2018-8-20,1,0,0
"A friend at work recommended I buy the Pro Controller and at first I thought it was a needless expense but he was right: it's great!! I'm so used to this kind of controller already, it makes playing my Switch so much more enjoyable. It's wider and the grip is more comfortable. The buttons are also closer together which is paramount to kicking butt in a game. It also pairs immediately with your switch by plugging it into the back using the included USB cord which was always an issue with all other consoles (which sync button so I press first and where the hell is it?!).Now I have 3 controllers: the pro controller and the two joy cons included with the Switch! It has 40 hours of charge for gameplay and when it runs out, you can switch (get it?) to the joy cons without having to stop to charge your controllers! This controller is the best!!",5,0,2017-8-13,1,0,0
What's up with the L stick Nintendo!? I've bought two of these and BOTH of them have malfunctioned with the L stick not working properly.

"Tbh I only got this item because I thought it would be a major upgrade from the joycons( mostly because of the drift) I've played several games with it and still haven't gotten used to the amount of travel in the joysticks. I love it for being a pro controller, there is nothing wrong with it. I'm not a d-pad person but I'm kinda glad it's there. But in all honesty if your a person that has only experienced the joycons then prepare to feel a little out of touch for about three days.",4,0,2019-12-11,1,0,0

It's extremely comfortable, and the battery life is seemingly unending (I have literally NEVER had it die on me...

"I'm sure there are many Switch owners that are perfectly happy using the Joy-Con.  I'm not one of them.  This controller solves a lot of the problems I have with the Joy-Con.  The Pro Controller comes with it's own USB-C cable and with a full charge it has outstanding battery life.  The Pro Controller also has an ACTUAL d-pad as opposed to the ""directional buttons"" on the Joy-Con.  I experienced none of the connection issues I had with the Joy-Con and synching this with the Switch took just a few seconds.  The Pro Controller also feels much more substantial in the hand.  The ""ABXY"" buttons are beefier and provide a more satisfying button press.  While I hesitate to say any accessory is a ""must have"", this one comes close.  If you're looking for a more traditional console feel and don't mind the slightly steep price tag, I highly recommend the Switch Pro Controller.  Rating: 9.5/10",5,0,2017-5-7,1,0,0
"The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is very well built, it's comfortable, has some weight to it and has textured grips to keep the controller from slipping out of your hands. There's no creaking or bending of the controller while playing, It's the alternative choice for those who want a more traditional way to play games compared to the Joy-Cons setup with the standard Attachment or Charging Grip. It comes with a USB-C cable and can be charged from the Switch docking station or AC adapter.It's an overall improvement over the Wii U Pro Controller, ditching the odd right joystick placement and moving it below the primary buttons, resembling a Xbox controller. It also has larger trigger buttons up top and larger X, A, Y, B buttons which are certainly welcome but it does still lack the pressure sensitive secondary analog triggers that both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 controllers have - I personally like having that when it comes to racing games. The analog sticks feel smooth and rise slightly around their circumference to prevent your thumbs from slipping off.  The classic D-pad makes a return again on the Pro-Controller, It's the same size as the d-pad on the Wii and Wii U Pro Controllers. It feels responsive and has the solid quality clicks you've come to expect from Nintendo controllers but I found that in a few instances, I've accidently click one direction when pressing another, thankfully it doesn't happen to me all the time but it could be improved.  The + and - button placements are easier to use compared to the Joy-Con setup and are more in reach this time around compared to the Wii U Pro Controller but I wish the buttons would protrude outward more like the Wii U Pro Controller. While playing and without looking down at the controller, I find myself feeling around the for the + or - buttons because they sit almost flush with the controller face and it makes them somewhat difficult to press. The Screenshot and Home buttons also sit very flush and sometimes I'll accidently end up pressing them instead of the - and + buttons.",4,0,2017-10-13,1,0,1
"This is no doubt one of the best Nintendo controllers I've ever felt, but the downside is that after a couple of months the left joystick starts to drift and it's because of the wear and tear of the joystick rubber so I've replaced one of my controller's rubber joysticks but that only solved a little of my problem I also need to replace the Analog Joysticks Thumbsticks!

"I play smash bros competitively. The feel of this is great and I don't notice any extra latency. When it works, it's great...and then everyone encounters the same problems that Nintendo still hasn't fixed.First, especially for smash bros players, the snapback on the left joystick will make you go the opposite direction when you don't want to. Just a little flick, but it can really mess you up while you're playing. If you're familiar with the terms, this controller frequently will make me B reverse in the air when I don't want to. There are fixes for it, but it requires opening up the controller and soldering part of it. If you don't have the supplies to do that, congratulations, you get to pay EVEN MORE for this already overpriced controller.",2,0,2019-8-9,1,0,0
"The hardware is just okay, but its certainly not worth the price I was expecting something special for over 100$ how I was so mistaken, I'll only give it 3 stars for being pc and mac compatible but isn't plug and play you have to install software like steam and set it up for your games within the program, its a bit fiddly unlike just plugging in your xbox pad and it works straight on windows with no problems.The button layout doesn't even come close to being as good as either the xbox one pad or the playstation 3/4 one, but it is better than those generic pads you can buy your for pc or console.",3,0,2020-3-4,1,0,1
"After about 4 months of owning this controller it started to have issues. First, it would no longer turn the Switch on remotely when using the Home button. Then it progressed to having big problems pairing with the Switch, despite many troubleshooting attempts, including following Nintendo's troubleshooting guide. After a couple weeks of this it stopped turning on at all. When contacting Nintendo, they told me that accessories only have a 90-day warranty, so a repair will cost nearly $50 with shipping, handling, and taxes. I purchased an official Nintendo controller expecting exceptional quality and a company who stands behind their own products. So I was very disappointed to find just the opposite. If you want a $60-70 disposable controller, then go ahead and buy this one. Otherwise, I'd suggest looking for an alternative.",1,0,2019-8-30,1,0,0
Bought two of these and after about 6 months one has the very common left joystick drift issue. After about 45 minutes of “tech” support they wanted $30 to fix it with additional $10 shipping charge.They told me Nintendo issued an “unofficial recall”  on the regular joy cons with left joystick issues but didn’t include the pro controller!!!

"I got this controller to make my Switch feel more like a home console in docked mode. With over a year of use, I can safely say that it definitely improved my experience with the Switch. It may be pricey, but the technology inside it is quite impressive, featuring Near Field Communication (NFC),  Accelerometer and Gyrometer for motion control, and advanced ""HD"" Rumble, meaning it really stands apart from other controllers. The only complaint I have with it is the D-Pad. It feels bad to use, and it is designed in a way that causes it to misread input.Pros:",4,0,2018-8-2,1,0,0
"I only wish it had analog triggers, but honestly no games so far have really had the need for that (I find that on my xbox one controllers when playing racing games, I'm flooring it 100% of the time lol).The layout and feel is spot on. The control stick are without A DOUBT the best I've ever used, aside from those on the Xbox Elite controller (which is a rip off price anyways). They have constant push-back and smooth movement, and after well over 1000 hours of use, the sticks still have no wiggle at their dead zones and still click without issue at any angle. Even if you don't have a switch this controller is fantastic for steam games or emulators.",4,0,2017-12-2,1,0,0
I bought one of these from Wal-Mart and it lost all bluetooth functionality after a couple months. I could use it when it was connected directly to the switch but after a few more months it wont even turn on when its connected.

*5-11-17 edited to add last paragraph as well as an extra sentence in the previous paragraph*Let's get down to brass tax here.  This controller feels cheap.

"This controller is great to hold in my hand and has an Xbox 360 controller feel. The buttons are a lot larger than the Joy-Cons and are a lot easier to hit.

"This is a fantastic control!  The buttons are much larger than those on the joy cons. The sticks are nice and tight and the directional pad is fantastic! In my opinion, the directional pad itself will make this control the best way to play games on the eventual Virtual Console. The joy cons are nicer than I expected, but PS4 and XBox players will find themselves right at home on the Pro Controller. I am confident it will enhance my enjoyment of every Switch game I play. I highly recommend this control to anyone who wants the best experience on the Switch!",5,0,2017-4-3,1,0,0
"It's the Pro Controller, but for the Switch. It keeps many of the themes of the last Pro Controller model, but tweaking each individual element. The sticks have a slight different, but very comfortable tension - they'e a nice height. The contentious change comes to the new stick layout, which is staggered, with the left control stick higher up above the directional pad and offset from the right control stick which sits below the classic Nintendo face buttons. The triggers keep the theme of having a simple button press, rather than implement any pressure technology and keep the usual design. The aesthetics are very interesting and the black faceplate is actually made of a translucent plastic, harkening back to some of the good old GameCube gear, and personally I'm a huge design. It keeps the massive battery life of the WiiU model and brings its charge into the modern age, with a USB C port rather than the bizarre choice for a USB mini on the old design. The controller ""handles"" have a new texturized ""grip"" which is aesthetically pleasing but not incredibly adhesive - fine by me. The whole matte aesthetic is a massive improvement than the fingerprint gathering shiny black plastic of the last model...Gamepads are really a person to person thing. To me though, there are a few stand out models that have emerged over time, and for me this joins the ranks of the DualShock 4 and the Xbox 360 controller, replacing its older brother and far outdoing it. I definitely see that many people have a problem with the price tag, but in my experience it comes with the territory (especially when such high quality is demanded over controller input these days.) To those people I say to use the ""butterfly"" joy con grip that comes with the console - it's really not that bad.",5,0,2017-9-21,1,0,0
"This controller is perfect. It's light, but not too light as you feel it will slip out of your hands. The buttons don't feel weak at all, very high-quality and sturdy. The analog sticks as well feel great; they are very responsive and very ergonomic, and the fact that they included a D-Pad is even better. One problem I have though with it is that the positioning of the home/screenshot buttons and the start/select buttons. I constantly find myself going to the home menu when I need to pause, or going to a different menu when I want to take a screenshot. I feel it would be better if they were reversed.",4,0,2018-5-5,1,0,0
"If you're playing a lot of single player games or online you should definitely get this controller instead of more joycons. The joycons are definitely more fragile and susceptible to wearing down and should be saved for playing games with others in person. The pro controller is really worth the investment since you won't have to continuously spend money on repairing or replacing joycons. Overall, it feels sturdy and has a nice shape that rest easy in the your hands.",5,0,2018-12-1,1,1,0

It also charges INSANELY fast! You can get 50% of battery after just 10 minutes on the charger! Last but not least, the controller is way more comfortable.

So, this isn't a question of if it will fail, but when.  To my knowledge Nintendo has not acknowledged the problem.

Also the battery life is amazing with my personal experience being roughly 30 hours or more. The only negative to the Pro Controller is the price. If it's about $55 or so, that's a decent sale.

"I got this for Christmas two years ago and I absolutely adore this controller. It's comfortable, has a premium feel, and huge battery life. You can leave this thing uncharged for a good week and it'll still have enough charge to last you next week. It's an absolute joy to play Breath of the Wild and Splatoon 2 with this thing, as well as other 2D games like Sonic Mania Plus. However, the only real gripe I have with it is its price point. It's around $70-$65 which makes it more than a new switch game and that feels pretty ridiculous. It's understandable why its that high with how much tech is crammed into it, but it still hurts. If you have a child or teen who tries to scrape together money to buy games for their switch, this makes an excellent gift. Its premium quality makes everyone want it, but its price makes it hard to buy which is why kids or people who are on a tight budget will appreciate this as a gift.",4,0,2019-9-21,1,0,0
"I've used a lot of game controllers in my life, & this one is one that tops them all. It takes about a week of extensive use for me to need to recharge it again. It's a good size for adult hands; an issue that the Joycons that come with the Switch had was that they were tiny, but the Pro Controller seems much more suited for longer use without cramping your hands trying to push buttons on a small controller. The lack of proprietary drivers and implementation is a welcome addition. With bluetooth on your PC, you can connect the Pro Controller and use it with Steam to play most games that support controllers.The one gripe I have with it is there isn't analog triggers, but digital ones. For people that aren't familiar with controllers, digital triggers means that when you touch the trigger its either in an off or on state. Analog triggers means that there's a middle ground where you can half pull the trigger and it counts as half pulled down. A game you might notice this on, that is on the Switch, would be Trials Rising.",5,0,2019-4-25,1,0,0
"The difference between my motion aiming in Splatoon 2 with this and my joy-cons is day and night. I was already doing fine but this controller took me to the next level. This is one seriously well built, sturdy controller, edged out (only slightly) by the godly Xbox One controller. Add in the gyro control and NFC reader and it's a no-brainer. With 40 hours of battery life, I have yet to need to charge it. All of this being said, the pro controller gives no specific advantage in any games (except possibly fighters that use the d-pad).

One controller drifted after a few days of use, the second controller drifted right out of the box. So far the drift is only an issue in Super Mario Maker 2, and causes making levels to be practically impossible while fighting the drifting cursor the entire time, forcing me to resort to using joycons. It's possible this caused by a slack in quality control due to Nintendo rushing to get more product out during the pandemic, but maybe not.

And I've got amazed by amazon prime same day delivery. Very satisfied. HOWEVER!!! The digital direction pad is not very accurate. It's either too sensitive or just messed up. When i try to press one direction it keeps mixing with the other direction. Other than that, overall its a great controller. I wanted give 3 stars because of digital pad but amazon sameday delivery was awesome so i gave one extra star!",4,0,2017-12-6,1,0,1

"I had to get me a proper controller for the switch.  The joy cons are some amazing tech, but they are made for a 4 year olds hands.  Even in the extra grip accessory.  This is a proper controller for a man's hands.  Pairs and wakes the switch in a few seconds.  Can't comment on the amiibo stuff as that's not really my thing.  Battery life is damn good.  Will obviously go down after time but as of right not its been going about 15 hours, still has 50% charge.  Are you listening SONY!!!  That being said I wish it took batteries like my X1 controllers.  Aslo would have like some better colors than just all black.  Not one ounce of color.  And last but not least, PRICE!!!

"This is the most comfortable controller for gaming, hands down. It's always a struggle for people with extra large hands to play video games because the companies have to consider all sizes when designing the primary input devices.

It's seamless connectivity and battery life make it #1 next to any competitor models for this console. Love it!",5,1,2019-5-20,1,1,0
"This is a fantastic controller and a far better alternative to the Joy-cons! It's expensive, but works well, is comfortable to use, and has the full suite of features (unlike some 3rd-party alternatives.)

No issues with joystick drift yet. I really like this controller. I bought it to play Astral Chain with and was not disappointed. I’ve replaced a few joysticks on my joycons now and it’s a pretty easy process so I’m not too worried about that happening with this controller. Great battery life I only have to charge it after really heavy use or after a few days if I’m not using it as much.,5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"I absolutely love the pro controller. It fits well in my hand (feels very similar to my xbox controllers which I'm used to), the battery life is INSANE even after over a year of frequent use, and they gyro and bluetooth work great.

"I didn’t think I’d like it as much as I do. Specially for smash bros. If you can just stop being such a purist, and put down the GameCube controllers for a minute. Please, do yourself a favor and pick up a pro controller.  It’s way smoother and has quicker response times. There is some  latency with the gc controllers and the adapter. I’m sure this also works great with every other game but if you’re here because of smash bros , i highly recommend this.",5,1,2019-4-11,1,0,0
This controller just feels so good in your hands. Once I started using this it is hard to go back to playing with the joycons. This controller has a good grip on it and has a nice weight as well that really makes it comfortable to play with.

"A dos meses de comprarlo (ya no lo puedo pedir reemplazo en amazon, tengo que hacer valida la garantía con latamel), está comenzando a fallar el stick izquierdo, aclaro que durante este tiempo no lo he usado demasiado por lo que mi molestia es mayor, aproveche el descuento que tenía para comprarlo debido a que el stick de mi joycon izquierdo tiene el mismo problema, no sé si tengo mala suerte o la calidad de nintendo está bajando, ya que todos dicen que sus productos son de excelente calidad, no sé qué pensar. Por lo demás el control es muy cómodo.",1,1,2019-4-9,0,4,0
"I bought two of these are a sale price, which I still find was about $15 too much for a controller that really isn't any better than an Xbox one, but someone is more expensive at full price.  Mind you, Nintendo does not like to put their own stuff on sale...ever, so I guess I count myself lucky for finding this at the price I did while it lasted.  Aside from the price.  The controller is decent enough to play most games with on the Switch for now.  There are plenty of other options out there if you're not that interested in having the rumble support, because other than is being wireless, that's all you're getting for $40 more than the wired controllers.",3,1,2019-2-2,0,1,0
"If you plan on playing the Switch mostly in docked mode, and playing it all the time, then I recommend this controller. At $100 with tax, there is no doubt that this is an EXPENSIVE controller. If you only plan on playing the Switch occasionally, and the Joycon grip is totally acceptable for you, then it's probably a good idea to wait for a sale or something. But if you plan on playing Zelda, Arms, Splatoon, etc a crap ton (and you have big hands) like me, it's worth it.",4,1,2017-6-8,0,3,0

"El Joy-Con Pro Controller es el equivalente del Pro Controller para el Wii U pero con algunas mejoras. El diseño del control es muy bueno, se siente bien al tacto y los botones se encuentran bien distribuidos. Tiene sensores de movimiento, vibración y a diferencia de la versión anterior tiene funcionalidad para utilizar los amiibos directo sobre el control. La duración de la batería es excelente, mucho mayor que la que los controles inalámbricos acostumbran tener. Ampliamente recomendable, su único aspecto negativo es que el precio del control es sumamente elevado, aún encontrándolo en oferta.",5,1,2017-12-26,0,6,0
"While the Joy-Con grip does the job for most of the currently available titles on the Switch, I've never been especially used to nubby analog joysticks of the kind you'll find on both the 3DS and the Switch proper. I always found they lacked travel and anything resembling a comfortable weight, which makes handling anything close to precision aiming a difficult prospect for me. Splatoon 2 and Breath of the Wild are, notably, two of the titles I own that I almost never play in handheld mode. Most of everything else works fine on the go, but these two games always brought up issues of comfort or adaptability.That said, while this controller works perfectly and can even sync with a PC providing you have a Bluetooth receiver on hand - an extra five bucks essentially nets you a perfectly worthwhile wireless controller for PC gaming - I have to admit that it's fairly pricey. It works flawlessly and could maybe stand to have less clicky shoulder buttons if I had to be nitpicky; but the Pro Controller's biggest drawback is its price tag. As a Canadian, paying a hundred bucks after taxes for something I can pick up in wired form or out of a third party for a fraction of the price hurts more than a little. You do pay for a sense of quality and for what has to be the best battery life in a wireless controller in the industry - this puppy essentially packs a 3DS' battery pack on its own, netting you a spectacular forty consecutive hours on a single charge - but it still does sting quite a bit.",5,1,2017-12-4,0,4,0

The feel of the plastic is really smooth and the controller is easy to grip. All of the buttons are great and the triggers have really nice feedback and click to them.

It has every possible features to support your Nintendo games like, HD rumble, motion control, NFC reader, etc. It is expensive compared to other controllers but those controllers lack many features that are in the Pro Controller.

"Excelente control, para cualquier juego de Switch. Si estás acostumbrado a los joycons, las palancas del Pro se sentirán más grandes y sensibles al principio. El sensor de movimiento funciona a la perfección. El d-pad es muy bueno para plataformeros 2D como Mario Maker o los juegos de NES y SNES.Es fácil de emparejar, sólo hay que conectarlo con el cable una vez al Switch y ya.

"Seamos sinceros, no llegaste a la publicación por accidente y te pusiste a leer los comentarios por aburrimiento...(bueno quizás si, no juzgare como pasas tu tiempo) pero bueno, si estas aquí es porque ya te llama la atención el producto y este control si representa una diferencia en el uso de la consola, pase un tiempo solo usando los joycon y en modo portátil es genial (sigo usándolos en este modo) pero al poner la switch en la tv, es cuando se disfruta tomar este control pro, créanme que no es lo mismo poner los joycon en la base que incluye la consola.",5,1,2018-1-16,0,7,0
"This is a great addition to include with your Nintendo Switch Console.  The Joy Cons and the Grip that is included with the Switch Console provide a suitable alternate to merge both Controllers together. However for any Gamer, especially an entry level or Hard Core Gamer, this is the Controller you need.  It is slightly bigger than the Controllers for other Game Brands but the feel, look and comfort is next to none.  I found it easier when playing either Mario Kart Deluxe and Lego Marvel Superheroes. This is not to imply the Joy Cons are not suitable for the Switch, they are great because there are Games that are designed specifically to use the Joy Cons either individually or collectively.  Again, the positives about this Controllers, and with the Joy Cons, it's quite versatile and anyone can use them.This Pro Controller is Wireless and includes a USB Cable to allow you to charge the device when required.  You can definitely play and charge the Controller at the same time however the cord is not significantly long enough; which would require you to sit closer to the Dock and TV screen.  Pairing the Controller is automatic and you choose directly from the On Screen Menu which Controller you wish to use.  The amazing part, you can swap between Controller and Joy Cons at any point during your Game.  This is a fantastic feature with the Nintendo Switch Console as well as the simplicity to toggle between Controllers.",5,1,2018-12-2,0,2,1
"Me encanta mi Nintendo Switch pero estoy acostumbrado a controles un poco más ""robustos"" que los Joy-cons incluidos con la consola. El Pro-Controller es exactamente eso, un control más robusto para los que estamos acostumbrados a los controles del Xbox o Playstation. Pero fuera de eso no incluye funciones adicionales (como la opción de conectar los audífonos al control como en las otras consolas) por ello los consideres caros.Debo mencionar, como un punto positivo, la larga duración de la batería de este control. Y el excelente servicio de envío de Amazon.",4,1,2017-8-8,0,2,0
"Love the controller - and is very similar to the Wii-U version, but feels more ""beefy"".  Charges via USB-C, like the Switch itself.Bonus - it comes with a USB-C to USB cable, so you can plug it into your switch's doc and have it charge when not in use.",5,1,2017-4-27,0,2,0
"It’s not a bad controller but it’s definitely not Nintendo’s best. Sticks are great and buttons all feel good, it is night and day compared to a set of JoyCons. It has all the bells and whistles of the JoyCons like motion, NFC and Switch wake up plus it’s battery life is leagues above anything in the current gen market, it should be an industry standard.Button placement could have been better. Having the plus and minus so close to the share and home buttons means you’ll be hitting them more than usual. At least for me my thumbs naturally reach to the home and share buttons instead of the other two. The d-pad is terrible. Very mushy and prone to false inputs, I wouldn’t recommend this controller if you’re mostly into 2D fighters and platformers. At best it’s on par with a 360 d-pad, my experience is it’s much worse. Not something you would expect from Nintendo considering their history of amazing d-pads.",3,1,2019-8-20,0,9,0

"The controller itself has all the functionalities of a joycon: HD rumble, Amiibo scanning, motion controls. It definitely feels much better than using the joycon grip. The analog sticks are one of the best ones I've used (even compared to the Xbox one controller). The whole controller feels very premium and has a great build quality. The d-pad isn't good on this controller, but everything else works perfectly.The controller is overpriced though. If you play the Switch almost exclusively in handheld mode then don't bother with this controller. Even when docked, I've used the joy con grip for months without any issue. If you really want to enhance your gaming experience with the switch in docked mode, then you might want to consider investing in this controller.",4,1,2019-5-7,0,4,0

"Este control se siente muy bien desde la primera vez que lo tienes en la mano. Inmediatamente se nota en su peso y construcción que es un control para un jugador serio. Los botones grandes, los joysticks cómodos y un D pad en forma hacen este en la forma definitiva para jugar en el Nintendo Switch (al menos frente al televisor). El control tiene unas 40 horas de autonomía y cuenta con todas las funciones de los joycon (excepto la cámara infrarroja), por lo que no te perderás de ninguna función en los títulos de renombre. Si tienes pensado conseguir un control adicional para el Switch y estas dispuesto a desembolsar una fuerte cantidad, este es el control que tienes que elegir.",5,1,2018-1-21,0,1,0
"Al momento de tener este control en tus manos, es tener la experiencia completa para jugar con tu Switch, se siente bastante ergonómico y cómodo para jugar. Un contra es su precio pero aún así lo consideraba mejor que los Joycon por su diseño, y eso ya es mucho decir. Se compró porque desgraciadamente se dañó el Joycon izquierdo que viene incluido cuando compras la consola (antes del año y entró en garantía para su reparación) para seguir utilizándola mientras se reparaba el joycon, y pensando que al ser un control completo, en teoría más robusto, no habría problema para jugar con el paso de los años, principalmente por su durabilidad. El detalle es que a pesar del alto costo del control (es más caro que un control de PS4) es de pésima calidad (se dañó al año 1 mes de comprado) por lo que seguramente ya no entra en garantía. Curiosamente se dañó de la palanca izquierda (en el Joycon también se dañó la palanca del Joycon izquierdo) por lo que considero es un fallo grave de diseño. Nada que ver comparado con los controles de PS4, la calidad es infinitamente superior, tengo 3 controles que se han utilizado por un poco más de 4 años casi diario y hasta el momento sin ninguna falla. Para nada recomendaría la compra de este control.",1,1,2019-12-25,0,8,0

"A pesar de que los joycons pueden hacer muchas cosas(mas que este control), este producto es necesario ya que la sensación es diferente, es prácticamente básico para algunos tipos de juegos y también mas cómodo que los joycons con el grip, ademas si se lo compras a Amazon es mucho mas barato que los joycons(inclusive sin grip) y como ya se dijo, es mucho mas funcional para una amplia gama de juegos por eso personalmente creo que como mínimo cualquiera que tenga el Switch debe de tener un Pro Controller. Así mismo debo decir que no he tenido ningún fallo de ningún tipo con este control en todo el mes que lo he tenido y usado.",5,1,2017-8-2,0,6,0
"Era escéptico de comprar este control, ya que inicialmente estaba pensando que comprar un par de joycon sería la mejor opción, ya que admite dos usuarios en lugar de un usuario fijo; sin embargo, después de meses de jugar con este control y compartirlo con mis amigos, descubrí que ambos productos tienen sus usos y que el control profesional es excepcional por sí solo. Es cómodo con muchas características que incluyen ruido, apuntado de gyro, compatibilidad con amiibo y compatibilidad con muchos juegos. La calidad de construcción también está más allá de las expectativas, ya que este control se me ha caído varias veces, sin daños en el hardware ni daños cosméticos significativos. Sin mencionar que las preocupaciones por el drift no son un problema aquí, ya que los afectados solo fueron los Joy-Con. Es algo caro para un control, pero te digo que vale CADA PESO. Es inalámbrico, la duración de la batería es muy larga, cómodo para sostener durante largas sesiones y construcción de ALTA CALIDAD por todas partes. Construído para perdurar. Creado para el abuso. Te va a encantar. ¡Muy recomendable!",5,1,2020-5-15,0,1,0

"I bought this controller because I wanted one with a good D-pad so I thought I should go with the official pro controller from Nintendo. What a mistake... The D-pad is the worse I ever experienced. It's always registering incorrect inputs, for example when pressing right or left, it will also register a up press. This makes most game unplayable. In Tetris 99, your blocks will fall rapidly because of the controller registering a ""up"" press. In Mario Maker, Mario will not move when pressing left/right since when combined with the unwanted ''up'' press, the game think you are trying to make a diagonal move which isn't supported. Make your research on Google, every pro controller having the same problem, you must take it apart and shim the d-pad with some tape and partially cover the 4 d-pad electrical contacts. Then the controller is Ok'ish, still registering incorrect inputs, but less frequently. This is unacceptable from Nintendo at this price. If you still buy after reading this: Be prepared to take your brand new controller apart to fix it yourself.",1,1,2019-12-17,0,2,0
"Estaba un poco indeciso sobre comprar el control pro por su alto precio pero gracias a amazon y sus increíbles ofertas estuvo a un precio irresistible y tuve que aprovechar y la verdad no puedo estar mas contentísimo con el resultado por que es otro mundo alado de los joy-con.Los joy-con son buenos controles pero son mas portátiles que para sesiones largas en la casa y es donde principalmente un servidor juega, este control me gusto ya es relativamente grande a lado de los joy-con desde sus sticks hasta sus botones principales A,B,Y,X e incluso sus botones L y R son grandes, ahora que anduve jugando Breath Of The Wild no me agradaba mucho esos botones me trababa al hacer algunas acciones pero con este nuevo ya nada que ver se siente muy robusto y con excelente agarre.",5,1,2017-3-10,0,5,1

Easy to set up and pair an then start playing.",5,1,2018-12-26,0,2,0
"Este control te puede servir de distintas formas. Tenerlo significa que tienes otro tipo de control con el que jugar y si solo tienes los 2 joycon que venían con la consola te sirve para tener otro jugador y además si juegas solo y se te están descargando los joycon puedes cambiar al mando pro fácilmente y poner a cargar los otros y viceversa. Además de ser cómodo también tiene un largo periodo de vida de la carga y muchas veces no te tienes que preocupar por eso. Viene con cable USB para conectar al Dock para que se cargue mientras juegas pero yo recomiendo cargarlo cuando no se esté jugando y con el cable de corriente que viene con el switch porque debido a su larga duración de la batería también toma su tiempo en cargarse totalmente si le queda poca batería. Lo recomiendo totalmente a los que quieren un mando de dos manos y lo recomiendo sobre los otros mandos de hori ya que esos son alambricos y el control pro tiene ventajas sobre estos además de ser inalámbricos  ya que tienen lector NFC, control de movimiento y vibración HD, que los mandos de hori no tienen estas funciones",5,1,2018-12-2,0,2,0
"I needed another set of controllers for the Nintendo switch and I was back and forth on which ones to choose. Should I get another set of Joy-Cons or the Pro Controller? The Joy-Con controllers are pretty amazing, use them as 1 unit, or separate them out. Track motion with them or connect them directly to the switch. What the Joy-Con controllers are capable of is impressive, but this multi-functionality comes at a cost. They aren't the most precise controllers nor the most comfortable, and once I used the Pro-Controller this became even more obvious.The Pro-Controller is one thing and one thing only, a great controller. The buttons and sticks are more precise and give you much more control over the game. The grip is better and more comfortable and the layout is simply more intuitive. Playing some games almost felt like an entirely new experience as the added precision from the Pro-Controller made accomplishing some feats much easier than they ever were with the Joy-Con's. If you plan on any serious gaming I feel the Pro Controllers are a must. The Joy-Cons are serviceable and fine for some games, but the added control from the Pro Controller is worth it.",5,1,2019-5-8,0,5,0
"Playing with this is a literally a night and day difference compared to the joy cons.... The range of motion is incredibly expanded, the build quality, responsiveness, the sheer perfection in the way your hands wrap around this makes it a joy to hold and use. Be it mario odessey or mario tennis aces, there is a level of comfort which you cannot achieve with the joycons. And i've not even tried zelda with this yet since i got it last evening. Zelda definitely felt awkward in handheld as well as with the joy-grips in docked mode. This should easily make it super comfy to use. I had first thought it'll be an expensive add on but dang this thing now means i'm never going back to the joycons at home. Be it docked or handheld mode. Outstanding.",5,1,2018-6-22,0,7,0

"Portato da Babbo Natale alla mia bimba per giocare a Splatoon2 su Nintendo Switch. E' un controller PRO originale marchiato Nintendo, che con il suo bluetooth 3.0 consente di giocare a distanza comodamente seduti in poltrona mentre la Switch è collegata alla TV, ma non solo! Infatti, impostando nei settaggi della switch  questo controller pro come primario rispetto ai joycon, vi permetterà di estrarre la Switch dalla base collegata alla tv, di appoggiarla su un supporto (anche uno usato per appoggiare i tablet) e senza usare i joycon di comandare l'intera Nintendo Switch  e giocare in qualsiasi posto ci faccia comodo. Oltre alla comodità,  è importante sapere che questo controller pro ha incorporati i sensori di movimento (ovvero il giroscopio); questi sensori facilitando il controllo dei movimenti fanno veramente la differenza nel controllo in gaming. Inoltre questo controller pro ha anche il sensore NFC, e cioè è quel sensore che permette, appoggiandoci sopra un amiibo Nintendo, di interagire con esso salvandoci dentro le partite, le configurazioni personali dei mii e attraverso il salvataggio dei dati di gaming nell'amiibo di ricevere per i vostri inkling di Splatoon vestiti e  armi omaggio gratuite in base al raggiungimento di punteggi prefissati. Questo controller pro viene fornito unitamente ad un cavetto usb per la ricarica, che così può essere attaccato per la ricarica in qualsiasi trasformatore di corrente usb (che non è in dotazione), come quello che sicuramente avete già in dotazione per i vostri cellulari.  Una volta carico la durata della batteria interna è super,  vi permetterà di giocare anche per più di 8 ore consecutive... veramente eccellente! Impossibile assegnare meno di 5 stelle anche se costa caro (pagato a Dicembre 2018 euro 69,77)Dimenticavo una cosa importante... per far vedere questo controller pro alla nintendo switch basta collegarlo temporaneamente con il cavo usb in dotazione direttamente in una presa della base della Nintendo Switch. La Switch così effettua automaticamente l'allineamento del controller e lo attiva. Per vedere come si fa basta andare su youtube cercando ""come sincronizzare il controller pro alla Nintendo Switch"" e troverete i video di spiegazione su come ""sync"" ovvero allineare e rendere primario il controller pro rispetto ai joycon in dotazione.",5,1,2018-12-30,0,4,1

It's an Asian lady beetle, an invasive species that also bites people. Absolutely unacceptable from Amazon and not expected from such a large company. It was dealt with and all would have been well if the controller worked fine, but it didn't. It synced to my Switch perfectly, but as soon as it was synced, I started to experience the dreaded ""joycon drift"" where the joystick registers movement even though you're not touching it.

Once I started playing, I no longer felt bad for paying $100 (I do believe it is overpriced but it is amazing).

I tried it with my platformers (Odyssey, Spyro, etc.), and found that I preferred the response of the analog sticks on the Joy-cons.The only thing that I would change is that I would add two depressions in the back where the ends of your middle fingers rest when holding the controller to make it a bit more comfortable.",5,1,2020-1-5,0,0,0

El precio es un poco elevado pero a final de cuentas se paga por  un producto de gran calidad.Actualización: Después de dos años de uso cambio mi calificación inicial de 5 a 4 estrellas, ya que después de un tiempo las palancas del control no responden correctamente o mandan señal de movimiento cuando se encuentran en posición neutral.",4,1,2018-9-27,0,0,0
"The joy-cons are great for some games but for every other this controller is ideal. It molds to my hand perfectly and the rumble is better then the PS4 and Xbox controllers. I'm not a fan of motion control and I'm glad I can turn it off. Never used the amigo function that just seems like a money grab to me. All that said its expensive! double the price of the enhanced wireless controller. So I basically paid $40 extra just for the rumble feature. I cant recommend this to anyone. You just have to ask yourself is the rumble, motion and amigo capabilities worth the extra $40, if not get the power A enhanced controller.",5,1,2019-1-23,0,0,0
"Entre los controles furris que trae la consola original, este aparato si te ayuda, mas si eres manón o torpe de dedos, al ser mas robusto no andas echando las bilis cuando presionas demasiado fuerte los joystic. Aguanta un buen rato cargado. En general si eres de los que echa espuma por la boca -como yo- cuando el control se convierte en un problema al jugar, compratelo. Claro, si eres rico, porque entre consola, juegos y de mas monerias, tal vez deberias pensar en comprarte un auto.",5,1,2019-8-11,0,0,0

"The Pro controller for the switch is one of the most comfortable Controllers I have held in a long time. Everything fits perfectly. The Sticks work well and have a good pushback to it. the face buttons are bigger which makes it easier to find. The shoulder Buttons are very comfortable.Then there is the D-pad. This is the only reason why I don't give this controller a perfect score. For some reason, The D-pad has a tendency to hit up when I'm pushing the Right. It's very frustrating when Playing Zelda and I'm in the heat of a battle and I'm quickly trying to change to different weapons only to be getting the Wrong inventory. This doesn't seem to be an isolated incident as I've been reading others have been going through the same problem. Everything else about this controller is perfect.",4,1,2017-4-27,0,1,0

Es bueno darle un respiro a los joy cons normales.EDITADO: Con el tiempo, un año de haberlo comprado y utilizarlo un par de veces a la semana, el joystick izquierdo se corre hacia abajo en los juegos. Busquen en internet, es un problema general de este control. Esperaba calidad impecable a la que nos tiene acostumbrados nintendo.

"This controller is a very nice addition to Nintendo Switch. If you own a Switch, I would recommend getting one (or better yet, get a special edition if you'd like). But if you are getting it for PC. I would recommend Xbox One controllers instead. The reason is that while both controllers would feel very nice in hand with subtle differences(one being the buttons on this has a softer feedback when pressed). You can get Xbox One controllers at a lower price with a lot more style options. It is rare to see this controller going on sale. For the same price, you can get an Xbox One controller + wireless adapter(if necessary) or almost 2 regular Xbox One controllers when on sale.",4,1,2019-2-16,0,0,0
"El pro controller funcionó perfecto, pero lo compré principalmente para corroborar si la conexión inalambrica de mi switch estaba mal y no eran mis joycons... y en foros dicen que se debería poder estar a más de 5 metros mientras no exista nada bloqueando la señal... al parecer mi Switch es la que tiene problemas con la señal, ya que no puedo estar a más de un metro sin que se desconecte, y con los joycons mucho menos a pesar de haber sido reparados por Nintendo, y el otro nuevo par que tengo parece tener sospechosamente el mismo problema que mis viejos Joycons...Pero el Pro controller llegó bien, completo, se siente increiblemente cómodo, al principio se siente un tanto raro al estar acostumbrado a los sticks de los joycons... compraría otros 3 para cuando salga Smash Bros <3",5,1,2018-10-28,0,3,0
"If you're like me, you probably thought that the joy con and controller shell were completely fine to use to play most games. However, the quality and the comfort of the controller is far superior to the Joy con controller shell combo that it cannot be overstated enough. As far as drawing comparisons to other controllers that are currently available, I would compare it mostly to the PlayStation 4 controller as far as comfort and hand feel, but with the superior control sticks of the Xbox One controller.Buttons don't have the same clicky tactile feel as the joycons do, which personally for me is a plus as they respond a little bit more like a button would on a traditional controller. As well, the shoulder buttons have a lot more of a solid durable feeling as opposed to the joycons slightly more flimsy feedback. The biggest win for the Pro Controller has to be the control sticks. They offer a level of control that you could not possibly get on the joycons. Where is I would consider the joy con control sticks to be completely serviceable, they still feel like a slightly upgraded 3 DS Circle pad. The Pro Controller is not even in the same ballpark, giving you a much more sturdy and reliable feeling control stick that doesn't feel like it's going to break if you're doing a control stick intensive game such as a fighting game or racing game.",5,1,2018-8-19,0,1,0
"Phenomenal controller!  This is more comfortable than the controllers from the other big consoles and has great button throw and response, as you would expect from Nintendo.  USB-C is welcomed as everything is moving towards that, making this controller more future-proof.  Great battery life too, easily outlasting the controllers on my PC and other game consoles.Some people have reported accuracy issues with the d-pad, but I have not experienced anything of the sort.  I have played a number of action games that require very precise d-pad movements and have not had a single slip up.  If some people are in fact having issues with their Pro Controller's d-pad, then they must have defective units.  Mine is perfect.",5,1,2017-4-27,0,1,0

Juego un nivel que requiere movimientos rápidos de la cruceta (Dpad) y OH SORPRESA, es tan imprecisa que frustra (presionas atrás-adelante y hace atrás-arriba, lo que provoca que lances los caparazones hacia el cielo en vez de hacia el frente. Para ciertos ""trucos"" kaizo se requiere precisión absoluta, cosa que este mando no ofrece). Tuve que abrirlo el mismo día, y hacer una pequeña ""reparación"" que vi en YouTube, funcionó, pero es lamentable que Nintendo presente su control PRO con severa falla.

The build quality is excellent, the larger D-Pad is much appreciated and the battery life is simply PHENOMENAL even several months on. However, the price is quite the inhibition, it is very expensive. I believe it is a matter of opinion whether or not the price justifies the quality or if it's simply the traditional Nintendo tax.

"At first I thought ""wow this is heavy, this isn't going to be comfortable to hold for very long"". (as a note, I do have disabilities which can make it difficult to hold objects with even a little weight, and I have some issues gripping things for long).Not with this controller! It's very comfortable to hold and only causes aggravation if I am hold it too tightly. The buttons and joysticks are well placed, and the grip is easy on the hands. I do have smaller band (bit long fingers) so I can see this may be more uncomfortable for those with large hands. It is a bit odd that the triggers are one push and not like the PlayStation or Xbox controllers where  different pressure causes different or greater effects, but Nintendo does do their own thing. I don't see many, if any, of their games needed that feature. Also, the home button is oddly placed, so it can be pushed too easily. Other than that, this is perfect controller for me. No hand cramps, nice textured grip, very responsive with all the features of the joycons, and it feels very solid. 5/5 from me",5,1,2020-3-22,0,0,0

"Love the feel of this controller, defintely a must have if you want to play games like Fortnite and Rocket League on the Switch. It feels a lot like the Xbox 360 controller which I loved, plus the quality of the controller as a whole is second to none. The price is pretty steep, but it's put together really well and in my opinion it's worth the extra $10-15 compared to the dualshock 4 and XB1 controller.My only gripe is the triggers don't have as much give as I'd like. I love the old LT/RT on the 360 controllers and I was really hoping for a similar feel, but instead they don't push down that much and it's almost hard to tell the difference between the bumper and the trigger on this controller. I'm getting used to it, but was hoping for a little more give.",4,1,2018-7-18,0,0,0

En dónde me di cuenta de este error fue en Puyo Puyo Tetris, donde por la velocidad a la que juego, tiendo a mover las piezas con mucha rapidez y por ende el bajado de las piezas es necesariamente preciso. Al jugar con este D-pad en algunas ocasiones las piezas se movían al final del recorrido.Fuera de eso es un control bastante bueno para utilizarlo en casa y si no juegas muchos juegos que necesiten precisión pixel por pixel es apto para ser jugado en la PC o en la Switch.",4,1,2019-4-3,0,0,0

This is one of the best controllers I have used. It feels great in the hand for long play sessions and I think have a better feel than the joycons. It’s similar to an xbox one controller and if you are swapping between an xbox to a switch the buttons can get confusing at first but it’ll be second nature with a few hours of play. I used this controller mostly on my PC and to my suprise it worked flawlessly. The bluetooth pairing is easy to do and there was no input lag when using it wireless altough the wired option is just as good and it comes with a wire.This is an amazing controller and if you need a controller for PC or Switch you can’t go wrong with this. The only downside I think is that the triggers are not analog and that bothered me for a while.,5,1,2020-7-19,0,0,0
"Don’t get me wrong, this is a comfy controller but the fact that Nintendo won’t admit that it has issues is sad. Ordered the latest revision 104889E and within 1 day the controller was already drifting. Not only that but the dpad is still TERRIBLE with constant misclicks. I can’t justify spending $100 on a controller with so many flaws, so next controller won’t be A Nintendo brand.",2,1,2020-4-17,0,0,0

The sticks are better located and have more travel. The shoulder buttons feel much better too. The easiest way to describe the controller, is that it feels a lot like the xbox 360 controller.** You can't play on your TV/Monitor while the console is charging the joy-cons.

The joy sticks have a pretty wide spin angle, which took me some time to get used to.Also, what is that annoying clicking sound when you move the two joy sticks? It clicks not only at a certain angle, but in every direction you move them. I would really prefer them to be quieter, especially for a $90 controller.",4,1,2020-9-16,0,0,0

Igual esto depende de cada usuario, en lo personal hubiese preferido que sea similar al de los joycon, siendo un boton independiente para cada dirección.Fuera de ello, el material se siente muy resistente y los botones firmes, los gatillos se sienten cómodos y el cargarse mediante USB Tipo-C le da un plus.",4,1,2020-4-12,0,0,0
