"I am one to spend 3-4+ hours searching online before I decide on which specific item I want (consider reviews, photos, cost, similar products). I wanted to get lights for above my kitchen cabinets but could not decide if I wanted the classic white or the option to change colors. Naturally no option provided both. I was afraid that the RGB light would make my apartment feel like a club or college dorm, but they didn’t ! The strip plugs into a wall outlet and has a remote. This is convenient because I 1) didn’t want to climb on top of my cabinets to turn on/off battery operated lights every time I wanted to use them and 2) they stay plugged in (no fumbling around for cords behind the fridge or other appliances) - at the touch of a button my apartment is transformed. There are several buttons that allow for changing to different colors, changing the brightness of those colors, and setting them to be solid or pulsate with a couple different speeds. The purple is my favorite of them all! They turned out really well, I would suggest this item over and over again!",5,1,2020-4-23,1,8,1
"Much brighter than my cheaper LED strip. The bluetooth control is handy too. I just wish it were USB powered. Did buy a 12V adapter, will see how it is once it gets here.Adapter did NOT work, didn't think it would oh well.",4,1,2020-3-17,1,1,1
These were pretty easy to install and I would 10 out of 10 recommend!,5,1,2020-5-18,1,2,1
"Perfect, good color settings, can go with music, adhesive really strong",5,1,2020-5-7,1,3,1
These bluetooth LED lights from Govee are not a bad option. My thoughts:Pros:,4,1,2020-6-19,1,2,0
Installed the strip above kitchen cabinets. One of the strips stopped working after 3 days and would not connect to Bluetooth app. After checking the strip I found that the transformer had a brown oily substance leaking from it and it smelled like it was burning. Uninstalled immediately.,1,1,2020-4-9,1,5,0
They are great but I thought you could cut them and they would still work! I thought that’s why they were the “cuttable style” and they have cut lines on the strip. So I cut them an now only one piece works. Does anyone know if I ruined them or if I’m doing something wrong?,3,1,2020-4-17,1,6,0
"Received the Wrong product. Ordered Govee lights which advertised Bluetooth capability in the product name online and on the box pictured online. The box I received does not have the Bluetooth logo, as shown in the picture online, nor does it mention Bluetooth capabilities anywhere in the instructions. In fact, the box i received looks completely different than what’s advertised online. Model number conveniently not disclosed on website for this model, but all the other models disclose model number. Definitely got a 6 for a 9.",1,1,2020-5-8,1,3,0
The lights were easy to install and work perfectly. I recommend them.,5,1,2020-4-20,1,6,0
"When I unpackaged the LED strip, I made sure to test it, and all the colors worked fine. However, after installing on my walls, I turned it on to find I was getting no blue light - only red/yellow/green. A connection had come loose during installation, which was a pain, and now I'll have to pull these lights down and probably remove paint in the process. I have a replacement on the way, so if that one works fine, I may update this review.HOWEVER, I'm incredibly disappointed that the app requires LOCATION services. There is absolutely no reason for this app to get my GPS data, and you CAN NOT USE the app without allowing it. Even if my replacement works properly, I will absolutely not be using the app unless the location requirement is removed, so I'm not getting the convenience I was hoping for.",2,1,2020-4-27,1,3,0
"WORTH IT!This product is worth my time to make a review. I was looking for something to amp up my room, I felt like it needed some life... Who knew that what I was missing were some LED lights that could sync up to beats! This product brought so much swagger into my room and now I can't wait to have dance parties or have super chill nights with some wine or hot choc and just listen to chill jams.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,5,0
These lights worked perfect for my guitar collection display. My kids think I went a little overboard. I think they are just jealous.,5,0,2020-1-31,1,2,0
I was suprised when it came in a little box but then I realized that was the exact lights I wanted! I saw a review of someone dancing to the led lights so I bought them! I just vibe with the lights while playing Bts and twice! Stream Bts on!,5,1,2020-3-19,1,1,0
"After my initial order of just one light strip.  I realized how easy, fun and mood enhancing the lights can be.  Needless to say I’m going to order two more which will make me at six.  I also gave one as a gift and I was told it was the best gift.  I recommend following manufacturer directions before installing to ensure the lights work plus all colors light up.  I had to exchange one set because the blue light didn’t work.  Seller honored my exchange without any hesitation. Hint-if you use more than one light of the same type or model, one remote will work on all.",5,1,2019-12-31,1,9,1
Ordered these LEDs to install in the door of my Wineador. LEDs arrived promptly and everything worked as they should except the remote which was broken. I used the my issues page on the Govee app and got a response back on the same day and they shipped me a new one out to replace remote. Talk about great Customer service A+++++. The best I have seen yet.,5,0,2019-11-18,1,1,1
"I bought this as a ""fun"" addition to my kitchen counter. It turns out very nice and has a bunch of features. The controller is great and has Bluetooth connectivity. I wish it has wifi connectivity but that's a higher priced kit.This one is good enough.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,8,0
These are exactly what we were looking for. Plus you can make a “scene” which combines the two strands so they come on simultaneously but not be connected.,5,1,2020-3-4,1,7,1
I attached these to my desk and it changes the whole vibe of my desk even the room and it looks amazing! Very easy to install and the cables are easy to manage so you can easily hide all of your cables. The less are very brite and the app is awesome for controlling them even the remote is good but I prefer the app it has better settings and cuatomization. Would recommend for budget leds!,5,1,2020-1-22,1,6,0
"Best smart lights I’ve ever bought. It is a great, high quality product which I can recommend to everyone. The setup couldn’t be easier and putting the lights on to the ceiling was also a lot easier that expected as well. I just bought 2 more sets to finish the whole room and I know it will look amazing because this is such a great product. Amazing job on making such a high quality product and I will definitely order a ton more from you guys.",5,1,2019-11-15,1,3,0
Nice. It creates different moods & vibes in my room.,5,1,2019-12-20,1,2,0
"I was ordering the lights that were supposed to work with google home but when i switched the length of the led strip I guess that length was not smart things enable, I was gonna let that go. But the app that comes with this is junk, barely works when you are 5 feet away (uses bluetooth to communicate with device), the timer on this never worked and to make things even better it just doesn't turn on AT ALL! I bought this March 9th literally one month and one day ago. So yeah... Garbage.",1,1,2020-4-10,1,1,0
"So I really like these lights for the price you pay. Having the app makes it easier and you have more customization options than just what the remote allows you. However,,these lights went out in under 6 days of having them. They just stopped working. The app has a category call ""Rapid Replacement "" which was quick and easy to report my issue. Just copied my order number from Amazon and they got in contact with me in less that 24..and im now awaiting a replacement part....ill follow up on whether it actually comes but so far customer service has been excellent.UPDATE:",5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,1
"I’ll say it over and over.  Govee costs a bit more than competitors.  But they value is there and then some in the overall quality, brightness, color, options and ease.  APP is seamless and connectivity is never an issue.  Believe me I tried to find better and return after return I ended up with Govee.  No regrets and you won’t either.",5,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0
"I really love these lights because if you lose the controller you have an app, when you first get it you have to connect the lights to the app just look it up on the box, it does tell you. (You don’t have to use the app if you don’t want to) But the app is very convenient, it allows you to change the mood or setting even specific brightness from 1-100, or even if you wanted to listen to music really loudly there’s a setting on these lights to go with the music/beat/rhythm. The connecter or extension is also helpful if you lose your controller, it does have the settings and colors and you can turn them off/on if you don’t have a device to pair it to or lost the controller.",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
A twelve year old could do it without any issues (besides putting it on in straight line).  The lights dance to the beat of the music and the app that goes hand in hand makes it even easier to enjoy. These are perfect for those kids that want to decorate their rooms to use as backlights for their social media or just to hang out.,4,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"I probably just got a bad luck of the draw, but only half of my lights turned on. I should note that previous govee strips i bought had 2 lights that would not display the same color as the other lights, so i had to put 2 pieces of black tape over them to keep the lights uniform. I don't think i'll be trying out other Govee products any time soon :(",3,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
Most smart lights in my house are hue brand but have to say that these lights work just as great. Was very easy to stick to the back of my couch and lights give off just enough lumins. App is easy to work with as well changing colors. Highly recommend for any home. Don't use the remote that comes with it but nice to have and a lot of features.,5,1,2020-3-23,1,0,1
"Place it on your computer desk, your tv, your door frame - get creative. Use a measurement tool and see what you can do with 16ft. May find yourself working with something longer than what you measured by a little, but what's wrong with that? I love this product. My room is super blue and it's relaxing for anime and sleeping. black out curtains too, so its always night time and im a vampire. goodnight.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"These do not connect to Google Home at all. If you do a little bit of research, you will see that there are tons of reviews on the Govee Home app from users who cannot get this to connect. I don't know why the reviews on here are so high. I will be returning for a refund.Also, the algorithm they use for RGB colors isn't great. It cannot achieve a yellow color. Just jumps from green to greenish orange to red.",1,1,2020-5-5,1,2,0
how do i access it from my app on the phone?,1,1,2020-1-25,1,2,0
"I'll admit, when I first received the item I was a little disappointed. No matter what I did, I could not get the light strip to connect to my phone via bluetooth. They have a, ""My Issue"" section under, ""My Profile"" built right into their app. I sent an image of the loading screen and wrote what I was trying to do. They responded quickly with some suggestions. After trying what they recommended, it still didn't work. They sent a new one right out to me! I opened the box, turned it on, and it connected right away! This one did come in a different box. I'm not sure if that has something to do with it. This new one works flawless and the customer service is incredible.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"These lights are awesome! Many options when it comes to led strips but these by far are the best value! App works great with Bluetooth, I can control the lights from the upper level of my house. Great connection. Music mode is very responsive and definitely provides that additional impact to the ambiance. I will say, I bought two sets of lights. One was not responding very well in music mode it would start out fine but then lose the beat and go into a slow fade mode. But, I got in contact with customer service, which is super easy on the app, and they quickly and sent me a replacement set, no questions asked! The service was outstanding! The new set works great! Comes with countless color options and some very cool “scene” settings. I would definitely recommend this product!",5,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0
I bought two of these sets and I've been super happy with the following parts:App control,5,1,2020-10-4,1,0,0
I wish there was a way to contact the seller without having to return it. I bought this and we mostly use the app but the remote is not working. I don’t feel like taking it down from the ceiling again.  It would be nice to have a working remote though. Tried 2 new batteries. Hopefully the seller will see this review can send me a new remote. I’ll gladly update the review.,2,1,2020-2-23,1,1,1
"Pros: Bright, vibrant and secure. These lights are lovely. They definitely give me the vibe I am looking for.Cons: The create your own color through the app is not accurate. There only about 10 true color settings. The adhesive is powerful &  will chip paint off your wall so be aware. The lights only pick up heavy bass music so don’t expect them to dance to any music without heavy bass.",4,1,2020-1-18,1,2,0
"Worst product I've ever  bought.  They say it is a certain length and it's a couple of feet shorter.  They say you can cut and splice it.  No way you can only get one color working after a splice.  I've spent $50.00 on two sets because the first set was not as long as describe.  It was listed at 16 feet, much more than I needed.  Well is was not enough.  So I bought another set and it would not splice as they stated.  Do not buy!  Went and bought rope light from Walmart and had no issues.",2,1,2020-6-9,1,1,0
"I have purchased multiple LED strips for my TV and I was never satisfied with the item until now. The adhesion on the strip is great, something that a vast majority of other strips lack. The LEDs used are great quality, solder joints are good. The addition of the app is great, allowing you to change or customize colors, change modes, or change brightness with ease. The microphone sensetivity for music mode is customizable, which I was surprised to see. I recommend this LED strip for anyone looking for ambient lighting.",5,1,2020-8-13,1,1,0
I just got them and i love them 😍 im so happy that they go with the music that’s my favorite thing . Definitely buy them again 🖤,5,1,2020-3-24,1,2,0
These are good for the cheap price. I was disappointed when I found out they only “sync up to the music they hear” which they don’t really because I won’t have music playing and they will still light up on music mode. I also wasn’t very happy when I found out that you can’t necessarily customize colors. If you pick a color that isn’t already an option it just shows up as white. Like I said you get what you pay for.,3,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"Works for the soul purpose of lighting my living room where my old floor lamp used to be. Wish there was some sort of tracks I could get for the strip, as I ran it up the wall and over my recliner on the ceiling. Doesn't stick to the ceiling, had used the clips that came with the lights. I need to improvise and make my own tracks. Looks tacky, but it will work til I can make it better. Have another strip for my CC-300H humidor. Looks great for it.",4,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"Gift for my teenager, she LOVES these. Mounted at top of the wall along one side of her room. She loves the strobe effect, the color changing, the ability to have lights flash with beat of her music. I can't stand the flashing, but that's ok. I do love the colors and brightness of the lights! Worth the money.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,1,0
"What drove me to purchasing these lights were the Bluetooth capabilities, but after having them for a week I think the quality of the product doesn’t outweigh the benefits of having Bluetooth. For one the lights continually flicker between shades (if it’s on an orange color it’ll flicker green.) Also I noticed the app doesn’t have accurate color input to the lights. When I put orange on the app for a “DIY” color it’ll give me yellow. Really frustrating and just wish I bought regular LED strips with a remote. I don’t know if I recommend this product.",1,1,2020-7-16,1,1,0
"Love the versatility of the light and how easy to set up and use this is! However, I would recommend not installing these near a television because I’ve noticed that when I use my TV remote, it seems to disrupt the light patterns and they will often change mode (blinking, and changing color) if I simply point my (TV) remote in a certain direction. I have a dog that is prone to seizures so I am very careful with this, but otherwise the lights are great, very wide variety of colors and brightness. Only mode I am not a fan of is the music mode, which is not very receptive to music I do play in the room.",4,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
So I decided to get these lights to go around my husband's 75 inch TV. It was super simple to stick around the TV. It however didn't fit around the whole 75 inches.  Left maybe 5 inches but doesn't bother me or make a difference. You can't even tell. Have the app on my phone so I like that I can control the lights from sitting on the sofa and seeing the kids eyes light up from the lights,5,1,2020-9-5,1,0,1
"Bought this on a whim, not a huge fan of rgb, but this is pretty slick. You can cut the strip shorter if you need to, had to cut about foot off of mine and i think it looks great. The blue is very soothing. Not quite sticky enough to be stuck under my desk so I put it on the sides. It does have additional sticky + screw in anchors which you’d probably want/ need for doing under sides of things.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,1
"If you try to connect them, they won't work right.We ordered the 65 foot one instead.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"Long story short, invest in the wi-fi enabled set instead of this Bluetooth one. This set is not as bright and it flickers. We bought this first and decided we needed another set to even out our entertainment center. Bought the smart wi-fi enabled and its brighter and does not flicker, plus its so much easier and convenient to use with the Echo.",4,1,2020-10-3,1,0,0
This was so easy to install and it looks great behind our tv!! I love the remote so you don’t have to get up and also the app for your phone!!

"These lights are wonderful.  I used to buy indoor Christmas style lights.  These are bright or low, I love all the different modes you can switch to.  They don't even put off heat like the Christmas indoor lights do.  I'm planning to buy my second box.  Love how you can control with your phone.",5,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0
"I bought these to set up around my desk area in my office space at home. Upon opening the package I was left a little confused as to why they would make the led strip out of paper with 3m adhesive on the back. Installation went without a hitch as was expected but the paper-thin quality of the RGB strip left a lot to be desired. Needless to say, a couple of days later, as I was trying to move one of my ethernet cables, the RGB strip ripped. I know it's my fault but for future reference, I wouldn't buy these simply because they are made out of paper and not the rubber material you see on a lot of other strips.",2,1,2020-4-30,1,1,0
I was going to buy the older version that was “google/Alexa” compatible. But while buying amazon recommended me to buy “newer” version. So I went for it thinking why would a new model not have something that older one did (especially compatibility with google assistant and such). I should’ve checked before I taped them on but really really disappointed. Not sure if they’ll even take them back now and replace with an older version since I already taped them.But really disappointed about no google assistant support!!!,3,1,2020-8-2,1,1,0

I love love love these lights! They really set an atmosphere. My daughter finally sleeps in her own room bcz she is able to use the light as a night light. I turn it on to one solid color of her choice and I can even set a timer to come in and go off whenever I want. I also get to control it from my phone which is so convenient. Highly recommended.,5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,1
"Oh my gosh, I LOVE these lights! I have absolutely no complaints and in fact, this is the fastest I’ve ever reviewed anything on Amazon. I applied these to the back of my tv and they’re so pretty. The app is an extra level of awesomeness, allowing me to create my own modes or change the color via Bluetooth. These are an inexpensive way to bring new life to a room. I purchased two more sets.",5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"The lights are honestly really decent, but there is one thing I want to warn you all of. My TCL TV remote interacts with the remote capabilities of these lights and when changing the channel, suddenly the light strip will start freaking out by flashing all kinds of colors. Took a couple of weeks to realize it, but now that I have, it may be time to move the lights or get a new strip.",3,1,2020-6-29,1,2,0
"These lights are fine overall, though the white has a very blueish hue to them and unfortunately, they just aren't that bright. Furthermore, the lights are PAPER THIN which is likely why they are so cheap relative to the Hue Strip Lights and Lixf Strip Lights of the world.On a positive note, they stick to my closet walls just fine and they're quick to respond to the IR remote.",3,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
"put these on my tv and ordered the right angle turns but ones they sent were all wrong color code lol so I improvised with ex bending to make the right angles but so far is sticking well and is impressive get compliments on it a lot now, don't like that some buttons I use on other remotes will change the colors ..they sould use different frequency I guess",3,1,2019-12-25,1,1,0

Ordered led light strips. Never could connect to my phone. Instructions were crap. Stopped working 2weeks later. Outside return period of 30days.. so dont buy these if you want long term durability. Amazon and company website us a joke.. never buy these from them again cheap chinese garbage.,1,1,2020-9-26,1,0,1
Love these lights! We purchased a new bed frame and i have the bruises to show for it. I have room darkening curtains bc i live in California and I thought these would help with bumping my legs and toes on the bed frame. They DID! No more bruises!Aside from its usefulness its an awesome touch to the bedroom!,5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,1
"Update: within a couple of day’s, the seller contacted me and offered to send replacements which have worked just fine! Thank you,As soon as I started to unroll and stick (very carefully) only the green lights would work. A complete waste of money.",4,1,2019-12-8,1,3,0

"The lights themselves are quite nice. I have them around a window underneath the curtain, so they glow underneath.  The color is very vibrant and I can create a very nice mood in my bedroom. I do find that sometimes if I've had them on, they will just randomly come on an hour later. I didn't turn them on at all... I figured maybe a vibration in the wall made them turn on? IDK, but it's happened a couple of times. It's just startling. I also find that they don't fade between colors very well. You have to create a color sequence yourself (which is a cool feature), but there's a limit on how many colors you can include in the sequence. If you don't pick colors that are similar to each other, it'll shift rather than fade, and its obvious. I got these for $15 and I am quite happy with what I got for that price, but if I wasn't so cheap, I probably would have done more research and gotten better ones.",3,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0
"My teenage daughter (15 yrs. old) picked these lights out for bedroom, and she loves them. The app for the lights that works on android or Apple devices is very easy to use, and she loves the control of changing the colors whenever she likes on her iPhone. In addition, the automation of different lighting patterns, including the ability to have the lights react to music, is a feature she finds most enjoyable and entertaining. Overall, easy to put up and set up via the lights’ app (the included control on the lights power cord is also easy to use when/if you’re not using the lights’ app). The brightness of the lights is perfect for her needs, and really does add a cool factor to her room’s appearance. Lastly, the only reason I gave the ‘Adhesion’ 4-Stars is due to the fact we’ve only had the lights on her wall for a few days. So, it will be interesting to see if the adhesive is still intact within the next few months. To anyone reading this review, I hope the insight provided here complements your decision making. All the best!Note: These lights plug into a regular electrical outlet, no batteries needed.",5,1,2020-5-14,1,1,0

I have had these lights about 28 days so far and have them installed under our kitchen cabinets. I actually bought both the BT (which I am writing the review for) and the WiFi enabled one as well.Overall so far I am very happy with these and at the price point with what I really wanted I feel these are worth it. I only wanted to get some accent light under our cabinets. I know some reviews say you cannot cut the light strip which in fact you can along the designated cut strips and splice them together. Or cut to the desired length if want it shorter than the 16 feet. I bought a kit that had some connectors and jumper cables for under the cabinets.,5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,1
"This strip works well out of the box. It has a handy remote and the app picked up the two sets I bought flawlessly. The colors looks good and the music feature is a nice touch. My only complaint is that I bought this set to have a tunable white light in a display case and only color it some of the time. The cool white looks great but the ""natural"" and ""warm"" whites both look green rather than the yellow/amber most ""soft white"" bulbs have.",4,1,2020-4-4,1,2,0

After working for over an hour trying to get even the base strip to work, it's all in the garbage.  Never again with this company.",1,1,2020-6-20,1,1,0
"Smaller then I expects not on long wise it is how they measure but way skinny wire, it looks a cheap version compare to the one I had , I wanted to blend them together but can’t due to different size but it’s good still just not the size I thought so I guess my mistake but still worth the price lmao",3,1,2020-3-25,1,1,0

At first I gave this five stars however after only a couple times of using them the started making a ticking noise which made me nervous.,3,1,2020-6-11,1,1,0
"Some of the best lights I have ordered hands down. Govee has it figured out! Depending on the age of the wall you are putting them on or the age of the product idk which one, in some parts of the strip they did not want to stick to the wall but hold on it comes with clips that you can screw into the wall to hold them on. I give this product a 4.9!",5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
"Very hard to install. The adhesive doesn’t last.  Yea the price is great, but you get what you pay for. I took it down and spend a few dollars more and purchased the light strip from Philips Hue. Very disappointed because the other reviews made it a great buy, but it wasn’t.",3,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"My 12 year old daughter got this, she loved it, it is actually really cool. she turns on her music and turns her lights to party with this COVID-19, but she uses the red light to sleep. it has several colors, it is easy to hang with the adhesive it comes with and it has a control. Cool",5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
These lights work flawlessly and look incredible. A set or two can turn a boring environment/room into a place you want to chill out in. Be careful tho... once you buy a kit and set it up the chances are damn good you'll end up finding a use for another set so you'll end up ordering more they are kinda addictive! So do yourself a favor and just order several kits at once you'll thank me!,5,1,2020-9-30,1,1,1
"Lights so far are good. Have not stuck them to anything yet to test adhesion. My problem is that half of the strip is a different color than what is set. Only red and green are the same color for the entire strip. Is this a bad strip? Not sure. Wish I knew that before ordering. If it was the same for the whole strip on all colors I would give it 5 stars. The remote and connected switch are really nice, as well as, the Govee app on iPhone.",3,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"Bought it initially with optimism for my new room and had it hanged up for two days before the adhesive began to fall down, used tape as a way to keep it up but kept on sagging down. The remote controller barely worked and the app had a poor user interface and questionable need of privacy with it needing your home address. I took it down as it was difficult on my eyes and gave me a headache after being on for a while as they're EXPOSED led lights which are awful for your health. When inspecting it I noticed there were ridges and warpings along the whole led strip. Overall, pretty poor product and wouldn't recommend.",1,1,2020-9-24,1,0,1
Very easy to install. The adhesive is great but I recommend putting the little supporters it came with on the corners for extra hold. Connects to the bluetooth app great. I got 2 16.4ft lights to cover 3 out of 4 walls in my room. The plug wire length is long enough to go up the wall from the outlet plus some length.,5,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
"Bought first for granddaughter, when her younger cousin/my grandson saw them, I had to buy more!! He is hearing impaired and loves lights of any kind. He loves these! Perfect purchase for both kids, even though one is 12 and the other is only 4.",5,1,2020-10-4,1,0,0
"the strip sticks well to the rough tv surface, but is hard to loop at the corners. big downside is that the it receiver is set off by the fire tv remote. when I turn the volume down on my tv the lights turn off and/or on. gotta find a way to block the receiver.",4,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
Easy to install. Easy to set up the app. The control works perfectly. No complaints really. The app lets you make whatever lighting scenes you want. You can set it to flash to your music. Music needs to be loud enough so the lights can flash in sync. Highly recommend. The price ain't too bad either.,5,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0

I will likely add on or get some more of these for other areas in my home.",4,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
"Bought this a few months ago for a remolding of a room that took longer than expected. Now that we are finally ready to put the lights up I have noticed upon opening the box that everything but the wall plug that connects to the control buttons for the wall.

It's very upsetting, it says everywhere its Bluetooth and when you receive the product you can only control it using the IR control it comes does not connect directly with the bluetooth, or trought the APP, it's a shame because the lights are actually cool, I'm sure you could sell them without having to trick people! I expect an answer I'm amazon prime user, I buy plenty of things trought amazon and this is unacceptable!Thanks in advance",1,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0

We used these lights to decorate my son’s room. He likes that he is able to change the color.Two things I really appreciate is that they plug into the wall. Our previous lights were battery powered and we used so many batteries. Also like how thin the strip is. It is able to hide on the underside of his bed. I was expecting it to be thicker like a rope light but I like how thin it is and how much lighting it produces.,5,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0

"Bought two to decorate two glass display shelves of figurines I own. Worked fine for the first week, then I noticed the colors were changing and falling out of sync on their own. For example, using Bluetooth, I’d configure the lights to both be cold white 100% brightness. Within five minutes, one strip might drop to 40% brightness while the other one somehow turns green? Pretty disappointed by these issues, as the point of it was for me to wirelessly synchronize my displays.",2,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0

And after opening the first one and setting it up everything was fine then I went to the second one and the remote was broken. Sounded like a piece was broken from it. Wasnt s big deal because I had the remote for the first one and it worked on both. Not even 2 weeks later this remote just broke.  It is set up in an area that is awkward for adults to reach so now I'm stuck with it.

These LED lights are amazing, very versatile, you can control the colors, the rhythm of the light from the remote and if you download the app, you can do even more!

"It’s a late review, but this are the best lights I’ve encounter so far! They can be controlled via remote that is connected to the light strip, I have yet to glue it, being kinda lazy, but hopefully it’s a solid adhesive. The best thing about the light is that it synchronizes with your music or any noise in the background that you want to match it with. Like you’re watching TV it will sync with that volume. Also it has an app, it works great on an iPhone as well as looking pretty modern. It has a couple options for music, color & scenes. Definitely super happy!

These lights popped up as a recommended item and I must say it was a great recommendation! The install was very easy and they look great! These replaced an old  rope light set I was using for top cabinet lighting in the kitchen and now gives it the look I was going for from the beginning. The versitility of the options that I now have are wonderful with the set. The only issue that I can across was for the connect of the mobile app for the lights. It requires both the Bluetooth and GPS location to be turned on or the app will not add the set to  your devices menu. Once the set has been added you can turn off the GPS location if needed but you must keep the Bluetooth on as that is how this set communicates with your phone or tablet. You do get to have more fun using the app instead of the remote it came with. Thinking of getting more of these for some other projects in mind. Great set for the price!,5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0

These lights were used for backlighting behind the tv. They work and look good. The only exception I can make is the double sided 3M tape pealed off halfway down the light strip so I had to use an alternate method. One thing however...... the remote that came with them is really cheesy. It’s cheap and only works from about a foot away.,4,1,2020-3-26,1,1,0

I LOVE THESE! I didn’t even need to put the extra clips in because the glue stuck on the wall very well. I’m not too keen on the music part because it seems to go off at anything it hears (like the fans) and it just ruins the experience. I wish it was hooked music to your phone that way. I’m trying to figure out how to buy another set to connect them to go around my room.,5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0

"These LED Strip Lights were very easy to install. They are really bright and you can adjust the brightness to ur like. They also have many, many different colors to choose from, and if you download the app, you can use the color wheel provided and make your own colors. Overall these are some really good lights that are cheap and do the job! I highly recommend these lights.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"Great light. I put my behind my TV screen on the wall at first. But to get the best lighting have it project ONTO the wall instead of from the wall. Looks great now at night or even during the day.

These lights are awesome! They stick right onto the wall and mine have not fallen off and it has been several months. My favorite part is the app on my phone so I can then them one and off and change the light settings without getting up and trying to find the cord. Very nice and would definitely recommend. We put them around the bottom of our large guinea pig cage.,5,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0

Bought these for my nephew’s room and they look/work great. He is 10 and installed them by himself with no issues and they are still holding strong almost a month later.

These lights are very nice unless you have to cut them.  I got 1 set previous and it was great and easy to cut and put extension wires in.

Very bright and good adhesion. Had enough to go around a 65 inch tv plus some. They do flicker to the beat of any music or sound when its in that mode.

So the lights are amazing. Super easy to install. Wish it came with more straps. They are suppose to help hold them up but used them for cable management.

"Great for the price. I got these for around 14 bucks on sale. Has a decent app, connects through bluetooth and good. A bit dissapointed it doesnt have addressable rgb.

All the led has to be same color, so no rainbow flowing type effect or anything. the rainbow more changes the whole strip to different colors unlike the picture where each led are different colors.",5,1,2020-9-29,1,2,0

My lights broke the next day & the blue light didn’t even want to turn on. I only had them for like a day. I didn’t even get to use them that much. Do not spend your money on them at all !! Will be disappointed!,1,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0

I actually have a question for the company. My friend bought me these and they worked but about a month or two ago I couldn't change the color or use the remote. I had to unplug them. I didn't use it much and my friends didn't have this problem. But I bought the correct batteries for the remote from two different stores. I don't know what is the problem and was wondering if you can help. Other than that it's amazing <3,4,0,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"Hands down the absolute BEST strip lights I've ever had. The quality of the actual lights is great, but my favorite part is the accessibility with the app. Theres SO MANY light settings that it's crazy what you can do with these! My one and only complaint (which isn't even a big complaint, still 5 star worthy) is the cord going to the lights. Its long (maybe 6ish feet?), I personally just needed it to be longer to reach the tall shelf I was placing them on for the lights to only be on the shelf and not hang (I have that pictured when the lights are pink). I will never buy a different brand of strip lights! I LOVE these very much!",5,0,2020-9-21,1,0,1
"Okay, I’ve bought LED lightstrips before and they weren’t the best quality so I didn’t have the highest expectations. These GOVEE lights stuck to my desk like they were super glued on and have amazing light. A customizable color scheme from an app on your phone! 10/10 recommend.",5,0,2020-8-2,1,0,0
I gave this product 1 start for the reason that it states that you can cut the strips and it will work but yet it does not only the part connected to the wall works! A waste of my money!,1,0,2020-6-7,1,1,0
After about a month the adhesive started to wear off. But other than that my granddaughter loves them and wants more!,4,0,2020-2-14,1,0,0
Got these lights and I was really excited to put them up until it came to the point where I had to connect the two strands and realized the piece to connect them was not included and its been a pain trying to find the right piece. Now I only have half of my lights that work and the other half doesn’t,2,0,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"After 3 months my lights became discolored in some areas, especially around turns. Everything else about these lights was superior to other brands until this happened. I’m repurchasing them but will hang on to my receipt and box this time as I believe there is some guarantee.",4,0,2020-4-21,1,0,0
