"there are four students in our family: children study at elementary schools and a middle school, and mother goes to college.  print a lot.  in addition, color projects often have to be printed.  print on a laser canon.  therefore, the main criterion for choosing paper was price.  according to the characteristics, this paper is not inferior to most analogues, the difference is only with that which offers photographic quality of color printing.  and for the price it has no equal.  we bought 8 packs for $ 29.99. Delivery on the 2nd day with Amazon Prime.  The quality as stated is very good.  the only difference is the packaging is not the same as on the Amazon window, but it does not bother me.  If the price does not change, my next order will be placed again in this company.Honestly, I chose paper for a very long time because there are two types: in simple words, for printing and for high-quality color printing.  And the price difference is very significant.  In order to make the right choice, I read a lot of reviews and got to the point that I began to study these types of paper and their main differences on the Internet.  To characterize the difference in a nutshell is the whiteness and density of the sheet.  And the numbers indicate that the difference is not very big.  Perhaps this difference can be felt by touch and look, but I did not have such an opportunity.  Then I decided to take the budget option and if I don’t like it, return it because the manufacturer leaves such a right for the buyer.  And I did not lose.  Normal-density paper is the same as any Documents or letters that we receive anywhere.  Print quality is very good.  The colors are bright and saturated.  I want to note that this particular offer on Amazon is the most advantageous for the price.  And it was also very nice that this paper is ours - made in America",5,1,2020-1-18,1,7,1
"This paper is very thin definitely not the standard 20 lb paper I am used to. Flimsy and see through, not what I am wanting to send out for customer invoicing. I was very surprised as I always viewed Hammermill paper as a good product and have never had any issues prior to this. Sorry I purchased a case, sending it back for refund.",2,1,2018-2-9,1,1,0
"at our house we go through a lot of paper.  I work from home, my spouse is printing off stuff, and my kid is doing that virtual learning stuff and needs to print things periodically.  so I buy a box at a time.No normally I go down to Staples or Office Max, or one of those and buy a box, but lately i've been checking amazon on the off chance they can meet the price, and save me the trouble of driving over there and lugging a box of paper around.  You have to factor in shipping, so keep that in mind.  paper isn't light.  I think i got this with no shipping fees, so a few days later I had a box of paper on the front doorstep.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,4,0
"This paper is not the 20 lbs it was advertised, it is so thin my printer picks up two sheets, printing one part of one and part of another sheet. I happens so frequently I estimate I lose 30 to 40 percent of paper not to mention the wasted toner and my time having to print one or two sheets at a time to prevent that happening. This paper is not as advertised. Total waste, and still have almost a full 6 reams to go to use up this garbage paper.",1,1,2020-7-15,1,4,0
"Good cheap 20 lb. paper. I put a case and a half though my xerox today without any trouble. A few of the reams had the edge of the top or bottom sheet folded over, but it’s not that big of a deal and certainly not an issue at the current price. And I like the 4000sh cases...they are abit easier on my back! :)",5,1,2018-6-8,1,1,0
This is basic everyday paper that works fine in a laser printer or inkjet printer. It's not anything fancy or special -- just plain 20 pound paper. I find it to be better than the store brand economy paper and it doesn't cost much more (or can even be less expensive if you catch this on a price dip).Been using Hammermill for years and years and have never been disappointed with the quality.,5,1,2018-11-18,1,7,0
"I bought this paper for printing weekly reports which are three (3) double-sided pages (total of six pages).  About 40% of the pages were crinkled and another 15% of the pages would double feed (i.e. feed two pages at the same time), which results in me having to trash that report and reprint it.  It was quite time consuming and wasteful.The amazing thing is that I have bought the same paper with the same item number previously from a local store, and not had a problem.  Ordering this for less cost on Amazon Services ended up costing me more in time and wasted paper.  Lastly, the quality of the paper felt different in that it was much more flimsy.  I believe this is what led to the excessive double feeding.",1,1,2020-3-4,1,2,0
"I too purchased a case, but only one ream came.  And...there was no way to talk to anybody about the mistake.  So I returned the very expensive ream of paper and bought a case from someone unrelated to Amazon.  This was my first bad experience with Amazon.  Sigh!",1,1,2016-2-29,1,2,0
"I bought this  Hammermill paper because of the low price.  I have two printers, a Xerox laser printer and a Brother inkjet.  Normally they very, very seldom jam.  Not with this paper!  While printing a single long document on either printer, it's a constant round of print a few  pages, clear the jam, print a few more pages, clear the jam, print a few more pages, clear the jam.  Sometimes it's print one page, clear the jam, print another page, clear the jam.  Then of course I have to very carefully examine every page in every document to  see which pages were jammed/destroyed and therefore have to be reprinted.  Of course some of those new pages jam, and I have to reprint them yet again. Did I mention that if I print a long document I like to go away, do something else, and come back when the document is printed?  Rather than standing over the printer and minding a 300-page job every second?  This paper is a nightmare to use.",1,1,2020-8-29,1,1,0
"I have used Hammermill Copy Plus for many years with great success, and that is what I thought I was ordering.  Hammermill Copy, which I ordered by mistake,  is okay, but a big step down for no significant difference in price.",3,1,2019-2-19,1,6,0
During the pandemic I couldn’t get to the store to pick it up where are usually buy it. It was a pleasure to have a source where I didn’t have to leave the house. Considering the effort to go to the store pick it up and loaded into the car and unloaded when I got home the couple of pennies more of this cost well worth it. Good product worth the money when you consider everything.,5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"I bought this paper twice. I used my dash button. The price did increase from the first time I purchased this box of paper. Not an issue there. What I'm pissed off about it that the paper quality is bad... The nicest word I can think of. The paper I received last time was a different weight then what is currently in this box. With the other paper could print on both sides without seeing through to the other side. This paper you can see through, curls and warps. It does not lay flat because of how thin it is. I'm sure this works great for some people. I need it in the classroom and it is distracting for the kids to see the ink from the other side. Now I don't know what I had received the last time. I don't know if that box was a mistake or if this box was the mistake. The packaging on this one matches the description. I have used up the other paper so I don't have any packaging to compare to beyond the ""reorder this item"" feature here on Amazon. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. I'm very frustrated! I will have to use twice the amount of paper because I can't do the two-sided prints.",1,1,2018-12-23,1,1,0
"The paper is exactly what one would expect; however, the warehouse people almost found a way to damage the top ream. They seem to throw the box around by the plastic strap which had cut through the box lid and almost into the top paper ream.",4,1,2018-6-30,1,3,0
"Good price, good weight and brightness for everyday printing, and good quality (works flawlessly in my multifunction printer/copier.) I recommend this weight and brightness for B/W laser printing for normal office documents. But I would definitely use a heavier paper for color printing. (You spend a fortune on color ink, so you want a heavier paper and a nicer finish to show off those colors!)",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"I stored copy paper for my office, and started to use this Hammerhill. It is much much thinner than another store brand (same 20lb - printed on package). Thin paper is ok for my application, I put one star is because of not as described from the manufacturer.",2,1,2020-7-7,1,1,0
"It might just be the couple cases we bought but about every 20-25 pages we will get a paper that is creased a little, just enough to aggravate you as it seems to happen only when im printing something I need to come out clean.  Doesnt affect the printer in any way though as far as a paper jam or anything.  Ive bought about 5 cases so far and 2 have done this in every ream.  Ill still keep buying for the price and quality though, hopefully those 2 cases were just a fluke.",4,1,2020-9-5,1,1,0
"I shopped around, we aren't going through anywhere near the usual paper since the current situation began. Used Hammermill Bond before and always had good results so this was a no-brainer since it matched the price of anything I could find in a store. Why lug it to the truck and then the office when you can get it delivered to the door for the same price or less.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
We ordered this paper at the beginning of social distancing when my husband started working from home and my kids stayed home from school. My 5 year old twins are learning to write so printing out worksheets was important. This paper was the best deal and has been so good to have. We have gone through alot but I am so glad we were able to buy 8 reams at once. Definitely recommend,5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"The paper is thin and slick and very smooth, so the paper rollers on my HP Laser 4015 could not grab it and I got jams almost every printing.  It was very frustrating.  Ordered for my home use, but had to take the whole box to my office.  It works on the huge Canon copy/printer thing we have at the office, so I got rid whole box that way.  BTW, if you have a frequently jamming laser printer, buy paper with 25% cotton, then no jams.  That's what I did and works perfect now.",1,1,2019-2-4,1,0,0
"I've purchased this item 5 times in the last year.  4 times it was great.  This last time was a disaster.  Both of my printers and my copier had paper jam after paper jam.  I don't know if the box sat in a warehouse too long and the paper got damp, or what happened. The paper feels slick, and the rollers can't catch it.  I'm throwing out half a box because it's so useless.",1,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"I may be wrong, but I assumed the weight of the paper was in reference to how think/thin the paper was.  We have been using Staples 20lb multipurpose and copy paper for years, but decided to try this 20lb paper for the lower cost.  This Hammermill paper is MUCH thinner than the Staples brand of the same weight.  When we print on this paper, the paper gets creases on it from the printer rollers and it the smallest bend to the paper (i.e. picking up a piece from a desk) puts a permanent dent in it.  We have never had this happen with any other brand of 20lb paper... not at all what was expected and a waste of money.",1,1,2019-1-3,1,8,0
"I have always used Hammermill paper, and I was surprised to see how poor the quality is with this. I had a 5 year old laser printer that worked like a champ. All of a sudden, every few pages would come out crinkled. I do a lot of printing of materials that must be sorted alphabetically, so I was frustrated by having to reprint random pages and re-alphabetize them manually. I suspected it might be the paper as I never had this problem before. I contacted the printer company, and they told me that the fuser roller was defective and that it can be replaced, but the cost was more than what a new printer would cost. I installed my new printer, relieved that I could start printing normally again. The third page came out crinkled. And the same behavior is happening, where every few pages comes out crinkled. I bought a ream of paper by a different manufacturer and none of the pages come out crinkled. I am very disappointed, and I have several reams remaining that are unused and can't be used.",1,1,2018-10-30,1,5,1
"Paper jams don't really worry me; they're very rare with my printer. I've been using Hammermill copy paper (same specs as this order) for a long time without problem. When I got this case, I saw the ""99.99% jam-free"" claim and realized I must have purchased a slightly different product than usual, but didn't think anything of it - until my print jobs started jamming every 5 pages. It was so bad that I had to switch the paper out for another brand; I returned the case. Because I like Hammermill's other paper products and cost, I'm sure I'll order their paper again - just not their ""jam-free"" variety.",1,1,2019-1-21,1,5,1
"The quality of this paper is MUCH better than I expected. You can actually feel the difference compared to standard copy paper. It is more expensive than I would have liked, but considering I would have to travel twenty minutes each way to purchase a box of paper from my local store, having it delivered to me for free is something I couldn't pass up. Sometimes I order from office depot's website for a good deal, but I didn't see any deals this time around. Since I ordered this, I ordered from quill.com, which has good deals on paper and offers free shipping. I haven't tested the quality of that paper just yet, though.",5,1,2018-1-9,1,5,0
"I'd been ordering this paper for a while, but the second most recent box I ordered has the problem of splitting in half. Many pages either split in two pieces longways while printing or have a thin line down the page that often splits when the paper is picked up or folded. I gave this product a second chance in case it was just one bad batch, but the most recent box has the same problem. I'll have to find a new kind of printer paper to order.",1,1,2019-3-14,1,2,0
"The paper is fine when I can get it to go through either of my printers without jamming.  I have a laser printer and an inkjet - both completely different styles and brands.  A few pages come through fine, but then it will either jam completely (my laser printer) or multiple pages will come through all together making the print spread out a few lines a piece on multiple pages and eventually leading to 4-6 pieces curled up inside my inkjet printer.  It is impossible to smooth out all the curled up pages to be able to try to put them through again, so I am loosing use of roughly 50% of the paper in my first ream.  I am really disappointed but really can't lug this heavy box by myself back to the post office to try to return it.  I wish I had tried the smaller box.",2,1,2018-7-30,1,2,0
The paper has wonderful contrast and never jams in my HP 8600 Plus. I would suggest buying half the amount the next time as the box is extremely heavy and I believe that is why so many reams are missing and some are damaged in shipping. Mine was perfect. The price is great and the quality is the best. I have been using this product for 15 years.,5,1,2016-3-14,1,4,0
"First time I've tried this paper for our office.  Every 5 pages or so have a very light weight piece of paper that has a ""silver"" line running through it!  Cannot use for professional use.  Very disappointed!  I bought 2 cases.  Will try and return one as the other have been all opened by all our departments.  This should not be for sale, or it should state ""rejects"" .",1,1,2019-1-14,1,1,1
The Hammermill Copy Paper met all the qualifications that it advertised. It was sturdy and bright enough for the job. The only problem I had was occasionally some blank pages came through with the copies.,5,1,2019-3-11,1,4,0
"What a deal!  Paper is over priced today but not this company or seller, they're just right.  This is not the paper for you if you want high density and clarity in your print in a professional environment but you just can't beat the price.  I wish I found these guys years ago.  I feel I got scammed all these years with all my past purchases but Amazon allows me to have the selection to choose from at the tip of my fingertips, awesome.  Thank you very much to all.",5,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"For Hammermill one expects a good if not high  quality of paper for printing documents.  EVERY SINGLE REAM has had paper with ripples, creases and distinct imperfections which causes the paper to get caught in the printer itself.Had I known with ream one that this would have continued throughout almost every  sheet of paper in every ream, I would have returned it to Amazon. Will NOT purchase again!",1,1,2020-9-12,1,2,0
"I tried to find a way to contact International Paper to give them feed back, but on their 'contact us' page of the web site there was no way to contact them that I could find.  The outer wrap of the reams is plastic, and very difficult to open.  I used a razor knife to at least get into it a little, and every time I tried to tear it open a little bit of plastic came off--it ended up in about 8 pieces.  Finally, more razor knife assistance and struggling, I got the paper out.  It shouldn't be this difficult AND why not use something that biodegrades faster, like, uh, paper?",3,1,2018-11-12,1,1,0
"I purchased the Hammermill paper due to great price for amount of paper, so for that I would give it 1 star. But also I give it 1 star because I am forced to instead of giving 0 stars which I wish I could. Compared to my past purchase of another brand with same color stats and 20lb weight it is horrible. This Hammermill paper is so thin and flimsy and not as white. You can feel the difference in your hands so I don't believe at all they are the same weighted paper. Also with my previous paper I could print on both sides with no issues. But with the Hammermill paper I am wasting paper because I cannot print on both sides due to major bleed through. I am not just talking about seeing a bit of what is on the other side, I am talking about ink bleeding through where it interferes with what is printed on that side. I would not recommend this paper to anyone. I will likely give this paper to my kid to do crafts on and I will get other paper that I can actually print on. This is terrible as I have heard of Hammermill before and figured they were a good brand for being around for a while. So either their paper sucks or this is a knock off in a Hammermill box. I have never used Hammermill before so I cannot compare to previous Hammermill paper.",1,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"Have bought the 4000 sheet box twice now for our small office, and this second time in particular I keep noticing how much variation there seems to be in sheet thickness and that we get a fair number of creased pages through our printers. Obviously variation in thickness is going to be a very small measurement! But it is noticeable. Our first shipment seemed to arrive unscathed but the second came with the majority of the ream wrappers broken open, which may contribute to the creasing in the machines. (It doesn't jam, just sometimes makes a crease.) My guess is this paper is manufactured to hit a price point more than a quality point, perhaps a line specific to Amazon. It is not labeled or marketed as the same Copy Plus line that Hammermill sells elsewhere.",2,1,2018-9-26,1,3,0
I thought I was getting a case of 10 but it is only 8. My bad for not paying attention when ordering. The paper is thinner than I'm used to and not as white. Jammed in my scanner. Seems okay for the laser printer. I wouldn't buy it again.,3,1,2018-10-12,1,4,0
Surprised that there was less paper in the box than in the boxes I have ordered from quill.com for years. Will have to pay closer attention when I must reorder. Perhaps Sam's will have a better deal? Perhaps the new Office Depot will not be as unappealing a location as its current space?,5,1,2018-12-26,1,3,0
"Good quality paper, no issues there.My issue dealt with the delivery.  Was told a date and they didn't live up to that date, had to go brick and mortar. Amazon did make amends, they were awesome. Again great paper.",4,1,2019-3-2,1,3,0
Shipping was fast. The paper reams were not in original box & box was bigger than paper. I posted pictures to show what they looked like when I opened the box,3,1,2019-3-19,1,4,1
"The wrapping around the paper is flimsy, loose and torn which will allow moisture to get in the paper.  This will probably cause problems down the line.  I believe this is because of too much handling from Amazon to the customer.  I thought this was just a bad experience.  This is the second case I am returning for the same reason.  The last case of Hammermill paper I purchased locally was of the COPY PLUS brand.  The wrapping was much thicker and tighter around the paper.  I will go to a local store and pick up the case myself.  Can't say much about the paper print quality or the brightness.  I did not get that far.",1,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"This is really nice bright paper that works great with our Brother monochrome laser printers. It's really awesome to be able to get it delivered to us and also to my Dad, who is quarantined in his assisted living facility to the pandemic. Bu that doesn't stop him from printing copious amounts. So glad we can order a quality paper and Amazon ships it straight to him, keeping to the rules that we're not allowed to visit until this pandemic has ebbed. Awesome! Great paper, awesome options!",5,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"Something is very wrong with this paper. I bought 5 boxes (50 reams total) for my company and literally every ream we tried resulted in a paper jam. There did not seem to be anything wrong with the paper. It was neat and without imperfections and they were all wrapped in the poly wrap that it came in. But it just kept jamming the printer. Sometimes we would get multiple jams per ream, much less one in 10,000, which I will go over in a bit.Our company prints up to 4000 pages in a business day so paper is very important, and as you can imagine it becomes very annoying to clear multiple paper jams in a day when every ream has at least one jam. This should be called the Bob Marley of paper... because it's always Jammin.",2,1,2019-4-24,1,4,1
The delivery driver did not even knock on the door to let me know they were there. I am disabled and can not lift anything. So it will have to sit outside my door until i can get someone to pick it up and bring it in. The driver could have set it inside my apartment for me. I have asked my delivery driver on several occasions not to just drop boxes and run.  This irritates me. I guess there needs to be a delivery instruction on every shipping area so the driver is aware of the purchasers ability to pick up a box.,5,1,2020-5-9,1,2,0
"I've been ordering this paper for 6 months without a problem, but my most recent order (January 2019) came with damaged reams. Every 5 - 10 sheets, I noticed a light line where the paper was especially thin. I didn't think much of it until I noticed that the paper tears at this line very easily. This meant my students' classwork and homework copies were coming back in pieces. I noticed another reviewer had the same issue recently (Dec 2018), so hopefully it was just a bad batch but still pretty frustrating.",1,1,2019-1-26,1,6,0
"I order a lot of paper with the same specs for general office use....20lb paper at 92 brightness.  I used to only order Georgia Pacific Spectrum, but it seems like there's been a shortage on that over the past year.  That was great paper!  Since then I've tried several other brands, and this is by far the worst.  There's no way this is 20lb paper.  You can very easily see through it and clearly read the text on the next page....it's very thin.  It also NOT 92 brightness.  When held next to the same spec. paper from the other brands I have laying around, it's significantly darker, and text/images are much lower quality when printed in the same laser printer.The value isn't horrible for the quantity of paper you get, but just be aware it's a much lower grade paper than advertised.  So far I have not had any jam issues or wrinkles like others have reported.",2,1,2020-7-6,1,1,0
Hammermill products are great. the paper rarely jams. The pricing on this too is the best you'll find around if you do the math. Also we ordered 7 cases and got the free shipping (you get free shipping on one item) but it was nice to have it delivered right to the door. No going out and lugging it around the store. loading it up and unloading it. Highly recommend!,5,1,2018-10-27,1,4,0
"I go through about 100-200 pages of paper a week and decided to go for a bulk purchase. This is a good value buy and it will get the job done but I really don't like this paper. I just didn't want to spend twice as much to get good paper for my own personal use, but do not use this paper for anything important.Now there is nothing wrong with this paper. It is exactly what it says it is. However, I really prefer 24lb paper weight. This paper is so flimsy that it is difficult to straighten out large documents for binding because it bends all over the place when you are trying to line up the pages. It will also crinkle more easily and it just feels cheap. The brightness is ok. Like I said it gets the job done and I was looking for a value buy so it's fine, but I would prefer brighter.",2,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0

I purchased this from used and in good condition-- the item arrived mostly together with a couple of packages torn/open and the box showing some external wear.

However, when I saw this for the price, which ended up being exactly the same price for the same quantity at my local ""W""-mart, I was sold!  Plus, I wouldn't need to load/unload it from my car.

I am so disappointed with this paper. It is getting jammed inside the printer I am afraid I am going to end up breaking my printer trying to remove the paper. It's very thin and it gets wrinkled inside the printer. Now I am stuck with all these papers that aren't good.,1,1,2020-6-7,1,1,0
"Very disappointing. For 20# paper, it feels thinner and ""plastic-y."" There is a definite curl after passing through our laser printer -- a problem we've not had with any other brand. That causes a mess in the printer's output tray. Ambient and printer temperature and humidity for storage and usage are well within the normal range, so no excuses there.Sustainable is of course a good way to go, but this particular paper is NOT recommended.",2,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"I bought this paper to print contracts and receipts for my business.  I still had some old paper left that I ordered from an office supply place near me so, when I ordered this paper, I made sure it was the same weight and brightness numbers.  Well, there is a big difference in that this Hammermill paper is not the same quality at all.  The paper is very thin.  When taking it out of the wrapper and standing it on its end to make it uniform, it collapses.  I am afraid I will have to reorder from my office supply place.  Will not order again.",1,1,2018-9-4,1,2,0
"I personally think it's worth the money, you get so much quantity for the money you spend. However, it's not the best quality for printing. A few have a white line across them.

Found the box corners broken and partially open when delivered on our doorstep. If it wasn't for the plastic wrapped reams I'm sure we would've had a good amount of lost or damaged paper.

"Though this paper is not the best quality for professional printing, we do not feel bad when the kids use it for other projects (coloring, drawing, etc) because the price was right. We have had it for months and still have plenty of paper to still use. For home use, this has been great. We will purchase again when we use up what we have.",4,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"Good price, but paper is thinner than expected. Very good for single sided prints/copies. Fair for two-sided prints if little color is involved.I would only use single sided copying only if pictures are involved.

It's all about arriving alive.  Paper was of great quality and the prime shipping was free.  Bright white, great thickness, and works well for home/work needs!

"I'm not a small business or large for that matter, just a personal user. I live in a 55+ community which has a lot of amenities.

I can print in any quality the printer can handle and the paper still makes it look good.

"This is great paper which used to be a decent price. However, like so many other items these days I wish you would not make the box smaller. I would rather you go ahead and up the price if you have to than make a smaller box. We all know these smaller size/same price items are going to cost more and give us less in the long run--costing us more on both ends ultimately. Really...we are not stupid and if I end up finding a paper as good and in the original size box of 10 reams, I will start buying THEIR paper.",5,1,2019-7-13,1,0,0

Office Depot and Staples will on occasion have a special where case paper may be cheaper which I take advantage but when sale items unavailable this is my choice for purchase.The paper is a very good quality for ink jet printing.  I use from one to two cases a month and never have a paper jam.  Once is a while, the printer may pull through multiple pages, however; it isn't frequent enough to be considered a deal breaker.",5,1,2019-6-2,1,0,0
"We use this paper at work for printing, with both ink jet and laser printers. It is a decent paper and does not jam. It is a little thin, and wouldn't use it on a super professional report, but it works well for the everyday printing. It is about half the price of buying individual reams at an office supply store. For some reason, the brick and mortar stores really up-charge for the 3-hole paper.",4,1,2019-2-19,1,1,0
"This purchase was a big mistake. It had me thinking it was my HP LaserJet, but it was not. I took the paper to a Ricoh copier: jammed there, too.  Put in a Samsung.  Same.  After one or two prints from a ream, it jams.  Finally installed in the company Xerox printer: same.  It's not about the cost--easily dropped off to daycare next door for kids to color on, but if you want quality paper without the non-revenue time lost unjamming your printer every time you print, skip this purchase. I expected more from Hammermill, but I guess no more.",1,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0

I buy both plain and 3 hole punched, and I've always had great results with it.My last order, delivered last friday, was left outside by the moronic UPS driver and it was rained on for hours, totally ruining the paper.

"This is fine, the price is right. Generally i don't like when something is packaged at a ""short"" weight or count, like 1.5 liter bottles trying to replace half gallons, but this is short in number (8 reams instead of 10) but also a little less in price, the paper is fine, and the box is a little easier to handle for being a little lighter. I tend to think of this kind of ""short"" weight as a rip off, but in this case I am willing to see it as is kind of an alternative. I would buy it again.",5,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0
It's a great price but this and all the other copy paper I've bought from Amazon have come in reams that are completely ripped to shreds. What on earth is happening in your warehouse?

I use a HP Laser Printer at home. This is the first time using the hammermill paper and I found that many times multiple Pages have gone through the printer at one time.

This is also good paper for crafts also.",5,1,2016-7-24,1,2,0

The Amazon truck driver just dumped it in front of the receiving window blocking all patients wanting to check in for their appointments.  I had to get a wooden roller to move all 5 boxes weighing around 40 pounds each inside the office door beyond the reception area.

"I have been buying this particular brand of copier paper for a few years because it's usually very well priced for the quality and brightness. In the past, the individual reams would be packaged in paper, and when the delivery guy dropped the carton off at my front door, half or more of the reams inside the carton would tear apart. This would dry out the paper as it sat on the shelf waiting to be used.Now they are wrapping the paper reams in plastic. But that's no better. While the reams stay intact inside the carton, they are almost impossible to open without using utility knives or scissors. It's enough of an annoyance to have to refill the paper in the copier let alone having to do battle with the wrapper on the paper ream. Besides, with all the plastic finding its way into the ocean these days, I find it ironic that Hammermill would design a school of swimming fish for its wrapper. Why can't Hammermill show some environmental consciousness and go back to paper wrappers that are designed to open easily but strong enough not to tear in impact.",3,1,2016-3-7,1,3,0

"The paper is great and the price is great. The two reasons I can't give it 5 Stars are the packaging and delivery. This paper is poly wrapped and it is very difficult to tear the wrappers off when loading the machine. The standard paper wrappers tear right off and loading the machine is a breeze. With the poly wrapped paper you need a scissor and it takes twice as long to open the paper and load the machine. In a production environment the extra time and effort is not what you want. Also, delivery through UPS beats up the cartons. The look of the cartons is pretty bad and the corners are sometimes dented causing you to waste some damaged sheets of paper.

"I bought this on sale at an office supply store and have been well pleased.  I am not doing office printing, just copying things for my own use.  I like the brightness.  I would prefer ever brighter, but it is a waste of money for what I print.  I have never had a jam, but occasionally a blank sheet will come through which is a bummer since my HP Instant Ink account goes by pages “printed” and one that slips through counts.  Aside from that, I have not had any trouble with it.  After reading all the problems about deliveries arriving damaged, I may just continue to get it at the office supply store.  It would be convenient to have a box delivered but I would be physically unable to get it to a P.O. to return it. For anyone who pays for Amazon Prime, I think Amazon should offer FREE PICK UP of any damaged shipments.

No difference in how it functions.  IT""S NOT AS BRIGHT as what I used to use...but I guess that's ok - it's a small thing and my clients haven't said a word.  All in all, I think I'll stick with it as long as it's available as it is - and for the price range it is.",5,1,2019-3-6,1,1,0
"I seem to always be in need of printing paper and this paper is nice, it is sturdy without being too thick and it makes for nice printed pages for the grandkids school projects. The price is great, the product is great and I will continue to use this brand of printing paper. You guessed it, it shipped the next day!! Great deal on Amazon Prime!!",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0

This is your basic printer paper. I ordered this to make a5 inserts and it works great for that. It's pretty thin (typical white printer paper thickness) and prints well enough. I haven't tested this with anything but a few pen inks which don't bleed or ghost.Pros:,4,1,2016-11-30,0,1,0
"estaba un poco dudosa al principio porque estoy acostumbrada a las marcas ""tradicionales"" de papel y me lleve una muy grata sorpresa. Es lo suficientemente grueso para imprimir y que se note lo normal si es de ambos lados. Sí es blanco y de buena calidad.",5,1,2020-8-10,0,0,0

Paper incredibly thin. Not comparable to any other 20 pound paper. As you can see in the photos it bleeds through if you print on both sides. In fact it bleeds through even if you’re printing one side so much so that you can read what is written on the back side.,1,1,2020-2-2,0,1,1
