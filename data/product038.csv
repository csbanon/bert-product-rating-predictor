"I had the 1000XM3, which unfortunately broke when the headband snapped. That fragility, along with the poor voice call quality, made me slightly resentful of the price I paid for them. Sony was great enough to replace it with a new one, which I decided to resell and use part of proceeds to upgrade to these guys.So far these work great! I'm still concerned about the durability, but I'll also only be using these guys for walks and runs around the city for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, that mitigates the risk of damage.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,6,0
"Here's my honest review. I apologize if it's going to be long, or if I offend your own opinions.First, I'm not an audiophile. I usually listen to YouTube and Spotify on my Windows computer through a $50 pair of headphones. But I do know what excellent sound should sound like. My dad taught me that when I was young.",3,1,2020-9-14,1,5,0
"I have never spent more than $70 on a pair of headphones, so Sony's new XM4 Headphones was a large purchase for me.To give you some context, my main headphones have been the Sony MDR7506 Large Diaphragm Headphones.",5,1,2020-8-21,1,6,0
"I spent both a live chat session and SIX phone calls with Sony customer support trying to get these to work properly, to no avail. This is one of the most disappointing purchases I've made recently. Arguably the biggest selling point of the XM4 over the XM3 headphones is the multi-device connection feature, which supposedly lets you switch automatically between two devices. Without this feature, you may as well buy the XM3 headphones for $100-$150 less. It doesn't work when paired with MacBook Pro and iPhone. I've tried everything — restoring the headphones to default settings, deleting and reinstalling the app, deregistering and re-registering the headphones from both devices — nothing works. Search the Sony subreddit and you'll find a bunch of posts with the exact same problem when using a Mac and iPhone with this feature. The headphones will not switch connection to the second device. Both my MacBook and iPhone are running the latest versions of their respective OS. The MacBook is a 16"" model from 2016 and the iPhone is an XS.It seems completely nuts to me that Sony didn't detect this issue before putting these on the market. After six support phone calls and a live chat session, Sony did not offer to replace my unit. They told me the problem was with my computer and if I would like to return the headphones, I could. It would be one thing if the headphones had a compatibility warning that says ""Does not work with MacBook Pros"" or something, but there is no such warning. So if you use a Mac and an iPhone and you're thinking about getting these, please realize you may find yourself spending many futile hours trying to get this feature to work. If you don't care about that feature, I'm sure they're a great buy. The sound quality is great and the noise cancelling is excellent. Just pick up a pair of XM3 headphones instead and save yourself a chunk of cash.",1,1,2020-8-27,1,5,0
"I previuosly used the XM3's for a week or so and then I saw these were coming out so I got the XM4's instead.Although these XM4's ended up being $80 more, I'm glad I spent the extra money.",5,1,2020-8-21,1,6,0

"First impressions. Easy to setup and firmware update guck and easy. Initially not impressed with noise cancellation as hearing a lot of ambient background noise. I’m finding the settings in Sony’s headphone connect app aren’t intuitive, at least for me.I expected heat to be an issue to some extent with over the ear headphones but these seem to retain heat more than other brands I’ve tried on  I have been unable to comfortably wear these for more than 5-10 minutes before my ears become uncomfortably warm. Other than that their comfort is outstanding. I don’t feel uncomfortable pressure on my ears or head surrounding my ears which some noice cancelling headphones do to create a better seal. Perhaps that is why I notice more ambient noice. As much as I was looking forward to owning these headphones based upon reviews of their predecessor as well as these by reviewers who received the new model in advance I don’t think they are going to work for me solely because they don’t seem to be well ventilated if that is possible with noise canceling headphones.",3,1,2020-8-20,1,4,0
"I really want to like these.  5/5, the noise cancellation works great.  5/5, the calls seem good.  4/5, the volume control is pretty easy albeit a little hokey.  3/5, they're somewhat comfortable for my big head but start to hurt after 30 minutes.  5/5, the battery life seems long lasting.  0/5, the two device control is awful.  One device control works well.  They easily connect to my iPhone X.  For the 2nd device, when I connect to my Mac, however, the main audio stays with my Mac, and I cannot switch back to the iPhone.  Certainly, the Sony audio app gives an indication that the headphones attempt to switch back to the iPhone, as the primary device, and then the headphones immediately switch back to my Mac, even with every audio and video app shutdown on my Mac.  In fact, the only way I can switch back to my iPhone is to disconnect the Bluetooth from my Mac.  I imagine Sony can fix this with a firmware update which brings me to the next issue, firmware upgrades.  Soon after pairing my iPhone to the headphones in the app--the initial pairing in the app failed until I forced the issue in the iPhone Bluetooth settings, by the way--the app attempted to update the headphone firmware.  When this happened, it stopped at 2%.  Much later, after switching between apps, returning to the Sony app, I saw the firmware update process stopped.  It was only when I checked the version, did I see that the firmware update works.  I would avoid purchasing these until Sony works out the kinks with some firmware upgrades.",2,1,2020-8-27,1,3,0
"I haven't had a set of over ear headphones in quite a while but I thought I'd give these a try based on the stellar reviews of the predecessor XM3 model.  Packaging is nice.  The instructions consist of a fold-out sheet with pictures only.  If you're not up on all the latest technology icons, you'll probably wish for printed words.  There is an additional instruction sheet in about 6-point font that's fairly useless.  Initially, I easily paired the headphones with my Apple TV and was able to use them quickly.  The next day I decided to download the app to get into the finer aspects of setup.  The app prompted a software update and allowed me to play around with equalizer settings and noise cancelling.  I highly recommend using the app in lieu of the cumbersome instructions.  Sound quality is very subjective.  You'll find reviewers who think these are the best ever and others not so much.  I fall in to the second group.  Sound is decent, but not anything that stands out relative to what I've used in the past.  At this price point I guess I expected more.  From a control standpoint, the right ear cup has a panel that you tap to start/pause music or calls, skip ahead or back, and swipe to make volume adjustments.  I absolutely hate the volume adjustment.  Each ""swipe"" is about a 10% adjustment, so if you want to quickly raise or lower volume, you have to make multiple swipes.  And half the time the swipes don't register.  If you aren't swiping perfectly up or down, you will skip the music forward or back.  If you're using the headphones with a device that has its own volume control, I recommend going that route.  It's much easier.  Overall, I'd rate the headphones slightly above average for sound and slightly below for controls.",3,1,2020-8-22,1,3,0
"This new version is definitely improved over the previous version, the noise canceling (so far, it’s only been less than an hour of use yet) is amazing, I can’t here much of anything with them on. Sound quality is amazing as well, wider soundstage than the XM3’s and the sound is buttery smooth. At first listen the volume seems a little bit lower at the maximum but with the super noise canceling you don’t need it to be louder. Also this is with the default settings as I have not tried using the equalizer as of yet. Super comfortable and they do seem as if the build is sturdier as well. The speak-to-chat feature is nice but I probably won’t use it much as when I had it on it was pausing at every sound I made (I did set it to high sensitivity which you can change in the app). The headphones came fully charged and updated the software pretty quickly and they were good to go. The best noise canceling headphones just got even better! Highly recommended!Update: 8/31/20 three main issues so far, the battery life seems worse when using the feature to connect to two devices simultaneously and the headphones only connect fully about 50% of the time and I have to go to Bluetooth settings to get them to connect. Also, wear sensor doesn’t always work and when putting paused headphones around my neck it often starts playing again. One more thing: the padding on the ear cups is slimmer and more plush so I feel the actual cups against the side of my face making them slightly less comfortable but not so much that it’s a deal breaker. I do like that you can put two fingers to the touch pad and hold to toggle the speak-to-chat feature on and off which is handier than going into the app to turn it off/on. Also I like that there is a power button in the app to quickly turn off the headphones and that they will auto shut off when taken off after a certain amount of time (although I have no idea how long that is as there is no way to change it in the app).",5,1,2020-8-20,1,3,1
"I have owned the Bose QC 35 series I (the originals) for four years now, and just recently replaced the ear pads since they finally deteriorated. I figured after four years there has to be some serious improvements in noise cancelling technology, and since the WH-1000XM3 model got so many good reviews I figured these would be awesome. So I pre-ordered them.I pulled them out of the box and followed the very quick connect process of downloading the app and using it to pair to my phone. It downloaded a firmware update automatically while I fiddled around with some settings briefly and listened to some music. Super easy, awesome.",2,1,2020-8-20,1,2,0
"So I was stuck between last year's M3 and the Bose 700. I saw these were coming out and wasn't sure. I did more research and was leaning towards the 700's to save money. I am primarily using these for WFH (music/calls) and the mic on the 700's is said to be amazing. As I researched I googled around and found that Bose has been having weeks of software issues and didn't want to get into that. I almost pre-ordered the M4's but decided to sleep on it because it didn't make a difference being in a queue. Finally one day, I found a YouTube video on the M4 and all my concerns were already addressed. I was sold.Yesterday (Aug 18th) these arrived at my door and I was on calls ALL DAY. They were perfect. Today, I get to enjoy music and silence –– HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,1,2020-8-19,1,1,0

"Just got my new XM4 yesterday. Did a full charge and downloaded the app. The sound isn't as good as I had hoped. I'm comparing then to my Bose QC 35. The controls are very awkward but I guess I need some time to adjust. The part I don't like is the technology aspect of these headphones. There are several settings to go thru to establish the proper noise cancelling, including location and sending pics of your ears to Sony. Of course I didn't upload any pics, and after lots of quirks, I turned off location. There is a setting that auto mutes the headphone when you speak, so if you intend to sing along with your music, it mutes. You can't even clear your throat or sneeze, otherwise it mutes. How annoying.. bottom line I turned all the technology off which makes them regular headphones. The sound is great when  playing music, but call quality is mediocre compared to Bose. In the app, you can change the equilizer presets a however, several are identical which is dumb. You can set a custom EQ setting. I'm considering returning them, but I will give a few more days for me to adjust and see if it gets better.One solid point I forgot to mention. The new Sonys have Bluetooth 5.0 where as Bose QC35 have 4.1 or 4.2 (depending on when you bought them). The Bose connection is not very stable. The receiving antenna is on the right side of Bose QC, and if my phone were on my left hip, it cuts it or jitters. The Sony's are absolutely solid, and with 5.0, you can literally walk around the house without your phone and it hasn't stuttered once.",3,1,2020-8-22,1,3,0
"As of about three years ago, I was an earbuds guy.  The wireless over-hear headphones I had tried previously never could approximate the kind of audio immersion you get when you wedge little speakers directly into your ear canals.  I never found over-hear headphone noise cancellation to work that well - often, turning it on would create more noise than it cancelled, compromising audio quality and, well, just sucking generally.  Not to mention the inconsistent and typically non-intuitive affordances for powering on/off, pairing, and controlling playback on these things.But then I picked up a pair of Sony's WH-H900N noise cancelling wireless headphones. I basically fell in love with them on day one and used the heck out of them over the past 3 years. So, now I'm an over-ear headphones guy.  Specifically, THIS line of over-ear headphones that Sony is putting out.",4,1,2020-8-23,1,3,1
"I hesitated before purchasing this product since it's a big investment. The experience is AMAZING so far with sound quality, noise cancellation, built quality, and battery life. I'd strongly recommend this product and can gladly say that this is one of the best headphones out there.Plus, Amazon really exceeds my expectation in terms of shipping & delivery. At first, Amazon promised me that they would deliver the product 2 days after the launch. However, it ended up delivering the product within just 1 day, making me one of the first customers that can try on this product. So 5 stars for Amazon as well!",5,1,2020-8-19,1,1,0

so off the bat the ANC is amazingly but did make me dizzy.  I get vertigo easily and these messed with my inner ear off the bat.  I'm getting use to them now.The DSEE X was completely messing with my Samsung TV Bluetooth. Not sure why.. i saw someone else have issue with this and tried it and saved amazom from a return.  I also turned to prioritize connectivity but that alone didn't do the trick.  Turning off DSEE was key... probably cause the tv is 2016? But before the phillips 805s worked and have 5.0 so not suee.

"I'm really conflicted with these. The noise cancellation is miles better than my QC 35 and airpods pro, and the sound quality is pretty good too. But these headphones creak to no end at the four points which connect the headband to the earcups. At first I thought it was a defective model so I got a replacement and tried to be as gingerly as possible but it started creaking again. I did some research on the XM3 and it seems these were an issue for those too. If you don't move your head at all it's fine but any movement of the head or jaw causes these creaking noises at those hinges. I really want to keep these because the noise cancellation is that good but when the headphones themselves cause distracting noises I don't know that I can justify these for $350. Maybe $250 for the XM3's and I can put up with the creaking noises but at this price point it's very difficult.Other complaints are fairly minor. Basically all the ""features"" that are advertised (not sure how many of them were also in the XM3's) are pretty gimmicky. The whole ""put one hand over the right ear cup when ordering a coffee""? Just slide the ear cup back and avoid looking like a goof. 19 levels of noise cancellation? I bought these for the max so cancel out the distractions in the back. The ambient sound noise works I guess but the microphones pick up wind noises too much and the headphones shifting around the head when walking make it more difficult to use - airpods pro transparency mode does this a lot better. The whole speak to put your headphones into ambient sound mode temporarily is super annoying. The only useful feature is the two connections, which is new to the XM4's. I personally don't like the pause music when lifting up the left ear cup because if I'm on a call and I lift it up to scratch my ear (which you will do a lot because your ear touches the inside walls of the headphones) and I put it back, my spotify will suddenly start ploying music again. Again, not a huge deal since the noise cancellation is that good. If only the headphones didn't creak so much, it would be well worth the $350. I'll use it for another two weeks to see if there is a ""break in"" period and the headphones stop creaking but if they don't, I'll have to make a tough choice on whether to keep them or return them.",3,1,2020-9-26,1,1,0
"I've owned the same pair of Bose QuietComfort 35 II headphones since 2017. Literally traveled all over with those things. I've had to replace the ear pads 3 times I think, but it was expected as I use them extensively for sales calls, music listening as well as music production and audio monitoring in a professional setting.With all that said, for the last 3 years, I've felt like the headphones did what they were suppose to and never let me down. They were light, did a decent job at noise cancelation and had a pretty good frequency response with respect to sound. I found the digital voice to be annoying though...",5,1,2020-8-21,1,2,1
"For summary, I don’t think this device deserves $350. I am not angry with SONY but a bit unimpressed. MX4 is not far away from MX3. If you are an average consumer like me, an $130 AirPods or $150 another NC headphones will be a similar experience. I am still debating if I want to keep MX4 or return it. It’s just not good enough.Well, here we go.",3,1,2020-8-30,1,1,1
"Love the music, noise cancelling but these aren't for your work calls at all. I am/was torn but when my team says I sound like I'm sick or in a tunnel all the time I know it's time to say enough is enough. I always knew they weren't brilliant for conf calls - they didn't advertise that they were - but being acceptable would have been good enough for me because of the other many qualities but this is not good enough - it's bad so .... hence the return. If you don't need the mic or you do conf calls with it, then you will love them otherwise ...",2,1,2020-8-26,1,4,0
"I was very excited about this new product and was finally willing to spend money since I now work from home. They are incredibly comfortable, sound quality is incredible but the microphones are horrible and call quality is non-existent. I was unable to use it for office calls. People said I sound robotic, like I was in a box or I had to speak up. Noise cancellation did nothing for ambient noise at any level. It picked up my dogs outside, the tv in the background and even my wife. It’s unacceptable for a product in this price range. I really don’t understand the rave reviews on this. If you are using them solely for music I completely agree but nothing else. I switched to the bose 700’s and it’s night and day for call quality and noise cancellation. Everyone says I am extremely clear now and they cannot hear anything in the background at all. Sound is good but nowhere near the punchy bass and ambient sound the Sony headphones have. I really tried to love my xm4‘s but could not justify not being able to also use them for work. Note: I did update them to latest firmware and tested every knob and feature in the app. Nothing changed what I was experiencing.",2,1,2020-8-28,1,2,0
"So far I'm extremely happy with my purchase.  I wanted to get beyond my budget headphones to take my closed-back listening experience to the next level.  The Sound of the XM4 is awesome.  I find the sound to be well balanced between the highs, mids, and lows.  I listen to all types of music sounds awesome.  This is a nice addition to my Sennheiser 58X Jubilee open-back headphones.  The sound is awesome whether it is over Bluetooth to my apple devices or when I attached vias cable.  Most will be very satisfied with the ANC.  I brought XM4s looking for quality sounding closed-back headphones with good ANC and not the other way around.  I found what I was looking for.Sony needs to work on the Bluetooth connecting to my Windows 10 machines.  Bluetooth connected fast and easy, but only works fine on my HP laptop while the sound breaks up on my custom built desktop.",5,1,2020-8-31,1,1,0
"I've only had these for a few days, so this review may change. I'll update it if it does.After using these headphones for many hours a day since I got them, I can say unequivocally that they are... fine. They're fine. First of all, it's important to note that I am one of those people who don't know anything about sound mixing, sound quality, equalizing, bass, treble... I don't know anything about any of it. I use my headphones almost constantly - 10 or more hours a day for podcasts, audiobooks, and the occasional work call. So I'm way more concerned with how the headphones function than how they sound because for me, they all sound pretty much the same.",3,1,2020-9-22,1,2,0
"I received this $350 pair of headphones which I thought would be new.  When I went to set it up it was already connected to ""Ian's phone"".  I'm NOT Ian nor does a Ian reside anywhere in my neighborhood.  I then realized that there was NO packing material in the box at all. No plastic bags, nothing was taped or sealed. I got them connected and the sound quality is on par with a $60 pair of Sony headphones that I bought for my wife. This may be the reason that Ian returned them.  There is a setting which cancels the noise cancellation when you speak, but it also pauses the music for 15+ seconds.  It's a great idea, if you need to ask what someone said before you start speaking, except for the fact that if you cough, sneeze, snort, laugh, or sing along it pauses your music. (That setting can be turned off.) I'm returning these and going to buy some from Best Buy to see if I received a defective pair since they don't sound as expected. I wish I could contact Ian to see what headphones he ended up buying.",3,1,2020-10-6,1,1,0
"My first problem was that i could not turn the headphones on. Couldn't figure it out for a long time. Turns out that you cannot turn the headphones on while they are charging.  Nowhere does the manual say this. I found that after wearing the headphones for 15 minutes, my ears were sweating and were too hot.  I found the sound quality to be good, but definitely nothing special. Can't imagine wearing these for any extended amount of time. It was too complicated to set up. Too many features made simple tasks like pairing difficult.",1,1,2020-9-29,1,2,0
"I recently started a job that requires air travel, and I knew I would want some good ANC headphones. After reading reviews on the XM3's (before the XM4's came out) I was nearly ready to purchase, but was holding back because of the lacking ability to pair to multiple devices. Even though I personally knew people with XM3's who raved about the sound quality, that one-at-a-time pairing was a serious deal breaker for me, going between phone and laptop for video conferences.Luckily, just before I needed to make my first business trip, the XM4's were released, and I have been so happy I did. They fixed the multi-pairing issue, the noise cancelling is incredible, and wearing them made for the best small-airline trips I've ever experienced.

Since Bose 700 is bit outside of my budget, I was focusing on XM3. At the same time they announced XM4 and I was eagerly awaiting till its release date. After getting the headset, I used it for only two days. It was quite disappointed because it did not meet my requirement. I needed a headphone for both music and take calls. While it is great for music, it did not do well for calls. It gives you a robotic sound when taking phone calls, you can't hear your own voice well and worse part is, other party complained few times that they can't hear me properly. That was a deal breaker for me.There are few more other minor issues. Bluetooth paring was hard.  It is not straight forward.

Chinese IEMs that cost $50 are dramatically better sounding and at the end of the day, that is why you buy headphones.Improved BT from XM3, Comfort seemed to be better for long listening sessions, touch controls improved.

"I got the MX4's for use when driving and in a noisy office location while doing college work. I also listen to music and audiobooks/podcasts nearly all day, and it is not uncommon for me to have a pair of cans on for 8-12 hours daily. Moving forward, my main comparison is with the Senheiser HD599 ($200) and the HiFiman HE4XX's ($150, plus $200 for a Schitt Modi/Magni DAC and AMP setup, coming to a total of $350 for all three pieces of hardware). My use case is pretty high-volume listening therefore, and my musical tastes go from Jazz, Pop and Trap to Classical, Folk, Acoustic, and Rock. Overall, I would definitely recommend the MX4's IF you are needing the top-end noise cancelation, as the hype surrounding the NC performance is definitely more reality than fiction. It makes my commutes and listening experience in noisy environments, including an interstate, very enjoyable and less fatiguing. I also certainly enjoy the convenience and mobility of these headphones, and the battery life has been excellent thus far. However, if you do not need the absolute best noise cancelling, or maybe don't care so much about mobility, then I would not recommend them due chiefly for the price and audio quality compromise. I shall elaborate, first with what I like:- Comfort (though for bigger ears it may be a little less so).",4,1,2020-8-25,1,3,0
"I am going to this headphones from the Bose Quiet Comfort II and mainly made the leap after Sony improved their multipoint bluetooth technology, which Bose already has, but also because of Sony's new microphone setup so I can use the headphone for phone calls. Sounds quality is great for songs, calls, and movies. Noise cancelling is great but no better than before. At least I could not tell any noticeable improvement. Call quality is great and I have had no complaints for microphone quality. My favorite features are the really impressive bluetooth range, battery life, and ear phone padding. The bass on this headphone is much better than anything Bose offers right now but I think Bose headphones are slightly more comfortable.

"Everyone is saying how good these headphones really are, but don't be fooled by that - try it for yourselves. Sure, it has upgraded padding, lightweight, easy on the ears, and subtle design improvements over its predecessor, but that's about where the difference ends - at least from a visual perspective anyway.I can tell you it sounds great, but that's to be expected from a brand new pair of premium headphones anyway. Listening to them I was not blown away. I didn't get it... until I went back to listen to my old pair for comparison. WOW! Only then could I truly appreciate the immense acoustic separation that the 1000XM4 fields! Perhaps it was the AI upscaling my MP3 to a higher level or perhaps it was just relying on it laurels as a superb pair of high quality headphones. Whatever it was, WOW!",5,1,2020-8-28,1,2,1
"If you want the very best quality, activate LDAC (Android or high-end DAP users). Sony's own app will tell you if LDAC is activated when you play music.If you use Android, don’t forget selecting WH-1000XM4’ Bluetooth connection and then settings, and then activating Codec: LDAC High Quality. (No, you don’t have to do the “developers mode"" absurd advice found on the internet, any phone today select LDAC automatically when available, and even if you try the “developers mode"", the phone will not recognize the LDAC unless you manually activate it from the Bluetooth’s individual connection).",5,1,2020-9-13,1,2,0

Muppets.They ignored and failed to address another issue, which was the total malfunction of the Quick Attention Mode, where you place your hand over the right ear cup and it pauses and goes to ambient.

"I own a pair of the xm2, xm3, and now the xm4.  the xm4 is by far the best pair of headphones I have owned.  They are lighter and the ear cups are a little larger with an easier fit making them more comfortableThe sound quality is superior to the xm3 and far superior to the xm2.  I also own a pair of the wfxm3  earbuds and the sound quality of the whxm4 headphones is better than the earbuds.  The ANC for the xm4 is about the same as the xm3 as I really couldn't tell the difference between the two.  I really like the fact that I can pair the xm4's to two different sources at the same time and switch between them seamlessly.  I also am enjoying the ability to start talking and have whatever I am listening to pause during my conversation and then start up again after I am done talking.  You have the ability to adjust the time after you stop talking to have your listening source start up again.  You also can turn the feature off if you prefer.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,2,0

"I use the headphones to listen to audio recordings from my smartphone and video from my Kindle Fire HD10.  For video I use VLC Player, for audio, PowerAMP.  The headphones are somewhat difficult to set up. I do not yet understand all of the options offered by the Headphone Connect app, but it appears to offer many options for customizing the audio to my ears.As did another reviewer, I found the audio latency a bit much - about 500ms, or 1/2 second.  I don't know what is normal for a bluetooth connection.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"These are amazing headphones! By far the lightest in class. So much so that that if I wear them to bed, I can literally forget I am wearing them! I have the 2 generations of B&W Bluetooth, and this blows them away for sound suppression and clarity. NC is for sure best in class. I have tried Bose QC 35, and I have Sony MX3. Sony is close, but the digital sound enhancements are exponentially better.But what REALLY blew me away today is range. So, I left iPhon 11 in pickup, walked about 50 yards, entered a restaurant. I was listening to music, and didn’t realize I was without phone until I wanted to change songs. The phone now was between 60 and 70 meters, with a car wall and store wall between us. THE MX4 STILL WAS CONNECTED AND WORKED!!!",5,1,2020-8-29,1,2,0
"Great noise cancelling headphones! Its a must buy, especially if you have not had noise cancelling headphones before. Sound quality is amazing, especially once you set the equalizer to how you like. Great all around features such as speak to chat and the sensor in the left earcup that detects when its being used. Multi device pairing works flawlessly, essential feature if you use your laptop and still want to get calls or watch media on your phone while still using the headphones. (Note: to pair with your laptop dont forget to hold down the power button until you hear that its in pairing mode). Finally, I really like the new silver color. Looks amazing in my opinion.",5,1,2020-8-23,1,3,0
"I've been using the Bose Quite Comfort II for the past 3 years, and really like them. The only down side was poor Bluetooth reception at anything more than a few feet of separation between the headphones and sound source. Using the Bose headphones to listen to my Sony TV (from 8 feet away) was a pleasure, unless you turn your head (cutouts and loss of sound-sync)...making them pretty much worthless for that application.I looked at the newer Bose and the Sony XM3 headphones as an upgrade, but decided to pass, as they were both tethered to Bluetooth 4, with the same reception issues as earlier Bose models.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,2,0

I came from xm2's. I pre-ordered them almost 3 years ago. As of yesterday up until the 4's arrived, I had worn them every single day for those 3 years. They are well loved and pretty beat up.

"Pros: beautiful headphones, above average sound. Class leader in noise canceling. Ability to connect simultaneously to 2 devices is huge. Watch the any number of rave YouTube reviews.Cons: call quality is below average when compared to earbuds such as Airpods Pro.

Will return.",3,1,2020-8-22,1,6,0
"Wow !!! At first I was extremely disappointed that they didn’t seem to sound like the ones I heard on display at a local store, so I researched how to get the best sound out of these so I could hopefully match what I heard.  I succeeded and it was very quick and easy.  The source of your music and quality stream is very very importantThe EQ can work wonders and there are easy tutorials to follow made by bona fide audiophiles that can have your music sounding beautiful, punchy ( just the right amount rather than muffled or muddy).  Just turning off ANC and selecting DSEE extreme (upscales music quality detail through Sony proprietary tech) make a very big difference.  The ANC is wonderful. Transparency mode ( or Ambient sound mode as Sony calls it) works well, but to be honest, if transparency mode is really important to you, Apple AirPods Pro are utterly amazing —the best).  I have always been a Bose guy and it was hard to imagine that these could challenge my Bose Bias from the past.  I tried these and then got ahold of some Bose 700 ( Bose top-shelf competitor for Sony XM3/4) to compare.  Sound detail:  ( quality/detail, soundstage, power, Customization ( EQ, etc) and ANC are clearly superior to Bose.  Call quality is less than impressive to be honest.  It works but not great.  Bose 700 have this hands down.  Final verdict: the win clearly goes to Sony.  This may not help but I also have the AirPods Pro and they don’t have quite the soundstage/detail as Sony but if you are going to use these to make calls and will be mobile a lot where having big cans on your head may not be practical ( in the car or walking around the store), I would choose the AirPods.  Transparency mode and the overall noise canceling quality on AirPods are unbelievable. The sound is really good also ( Sony is better on to be sure).  I do hope this review helps someone out there trying to decide between the three mentioned here. Bottom line is you will really enjoy these",3,1,2020-8-26,1,1,0
"This headphone has VERY little downsides and many upsides.Build and Fit (4.5/5): Doesn't feel super premium, but not cheap either. It just has this light, high quality plastic feel to it. The earcup cushions take little pressure to compress, so you sort of feel the body of the headphone press against your head. It's not uncomfortable by any means, maybe just a tad unnatural. But you get used to it extremely quickly. Definitely good for long listening sessions.",5,1,2020-8-27,1,2,0

"Got it on Friday, and the headphone is not chargeable. It cannot be charge on the PC using the type-c line provided, “the red light which is showing it is charging” is off, and when it charges on a adaptor, the headphone will only “charge” for 5 minutes (and by the meaning of “charge” is I only see the red light turn on for 5 minutes and then turn off) the battery of the headphone is below 10% and it won’t charge anymore. I tried to re-charge it, the red light just turn on for 20seconds and then turn off. I have tried using different adaptors, plug in different usb spots of PC, and using different type-c line, neither of it worked. I am reaching the seller now, and I will either ask for a replacement or refund.",1,1,2020-8-30,1,3,0
"Absolutely love these. Noise Cancellation is incredibly effective. It takes quite a lot to hear through it even without music. I suppose the pausing during conversation feature could be smoother, but that isn't a big issue for me. Amazing battery life and features. Sound quality is superb, probably the best I've ever heard from headphones. Rich bass that you can feel, and the highs and mids are punchy and crisp and don't get lost. Incredibly well balanced sound. As for comfort, it took a small amount of adjusting but they feel like a cloud. Soft, supple leather, and there isn't too much clamp force. They do stay on, too. Love that they can be wired or wireless, as I have both a phone and a desktop (the letter doesn't have Bluetooth). The case is light yet firm, and even has a mesh pocket on the back to hold your other goodies. The texture of the cans is luxurious, and the same holds true for the case. Mic isn't perfect, but it's good. Overall, it's very expensive but a great buy if you're in the market.",5,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0
"Best headphones I have ever owned. Sound quality is immaculate. Noise canceling is very effective. If you have ever owned premium wired headphones, you know what to expect in sound quality. Bluetooth and noise canceling have always been working against sound quality. No more. The comfort, sound equalizer, and other smart features make these a no brainer. Love them. Well worth the hefty price. No buyers remorse here.UPDATE: Please enhance headphones connect app to make it easier to switch between the 2 connected devices on new XM4 headphones. It’s cumbersome to disconnect the current playing device first.  I should be able to select the other device and it will switch effortlessly.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,2,0
"I bought a paid of the WH-1000XM4's and Bose NC 700's trying to decide which one was better. I prefer the Sony headphones in terms of customization and sound. However, I will be returning these due to the headband and ear cups. The headband puts a lot of pressure on the crown of my head, no matter how I adjust it, causing pain and headaches if wearing for more than an hour or so. Regarding the ear cups, they are very shallow and I can feel my ears touching the inner portion of the headphones. This puts pressure on my ears, so that after a couple hours it becomes uncomfortable as well.For some reason, the Bose NC 700's do not have these pressure issues for me. I cannot say it will be the same for everyone, but I will be going with the 700's specifically for this reason.",3,1,2020-8-25,1,3,0
"This is almost the same as XM3, sounding everything is great but it has issues that made me prefer XM3 over this.First, I didn't try the real 3D included.

These are great headphones but sometimes all the features with ambient sound are annoying.These headphones are made by Sony but they are too new for the Playstation 4 to recognize therefore you have to plug them into the controller for them to work. I also have a QLED tv thats only like 5 years old and they don't recognize the headphones either.  If you plug the headphones into the controller they lose the ability to control the ambient sound settings so if i say 1 word the noise canceling goes away assuming you're going to have a full conversation. So everytime I answer someone a simple yes or no I have to push the button to get the sound to play again which gets tedious after awhile.,4,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"I've owned the Sony 1000XM3, H900N, and the Bose QC35 II.  I couldn't wait for the XM4 to come out because of the multipoint Bluetooth (I'll get to that a little later).

"ANC is great, but situational.  Please understand that ANC does not make music sound better.  It blocks out ambient sounds, noise and voices.  It won't cancel out direct wind nor your chewing.  While the sound is very good, I'm sticking with my Sennheiser Momentum TW's, which in my opinion sound better.  Mid's to me sound a bit muted, otherwise the highs and lows are pretty good.  I'm not a huge fan of over the head cans either, but I was willing to give these a shot.  Being able to pair these and have them connected to multiple devices is a big plus, but as always trying to use these (BT) as a computer mic/headset is a very poor experience, especially with Discord (I really wish companies could figure this out).  Great battery life and these can be updated with firmware for future proofing.  The white is not really white, it's more gray and contrary to some belief, they do not look more premium, but they don't look cheap either.  It's personal preference really.",4,1,2020-8-31,1,1,0

"UPDATED:  I decided to mark these down from 3 to 2 stars because, in the last few days, the bluetooth has started to act buggy.  Audio files simply stop playing for no apparent reason (in some cases, my music has stopped apparently because someone else with a bluetooth device gets within about 30 feet of me, but in other cases the music stops for no apparent reason at all).  At other times, there are skips or pops.  While the noise cancellation is fantastic, and I'm still thinking keeping them for this reason alone, I'm now more likely to return them -- $350 is just too much money for these kinds of problems.These are great headphones -- outstanding in many respects -- but they have some issues that, given the $350 price, do not merit a 5-star review.  I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on the lower rating given the very high price for this product.",2,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0

"Let me explain. I am an audiophile, music enthusiast..., you get the picture. To me, sound is pretty much everything, with comfort and build quality (how long the product will last) also being important. Hours upon hours of research online led me to those beautiful pieces of art. 9/10 of the websites I visited had these at the #1 spot so I placed my order. When I got the package, I headed straight for the instructions, read what i needed to know, and carefully pulled out the pair of cans. The design, as I have said before, is beautiful. As I tried them on, I noticed how incredibly light and comfy they were. The moment I turned them on, the noise cancelling kicked in, and, o wow, the world really does fall away. Now, the moment I've been waiting for. I plug them into my phone, turn my phone down to protect my ears (haha), and play ""I Like Me Better"" by Lauv. First reaction: OWW. The treble is flat out painful. So then, I connect the headphones to my phone over bluetooth and set them up within the app, taking pictures of my ears..., (Yes it customized the NC and music to your ears, which is kinda cool.) I prefer a wired connection, because I listen to FLAC music files (CD quality music) and bluetooth degrades that quality. But, I tried it anyway to see how it would go. The app was pretty simple to use, and finally, I found it, the eq. I turned down the treble a little and pressed play on the song. It sounded aweful. I put the eq back to flat and it sounded exceptional quality-wise, but still piercing. The moment I turned down the treble again, music dropped out and turned back on, sounding really bad. I scrolled down in the app and found out that to use the eq, it lowers the quality, and noticeably. I was done. These were returned the next day.",2,1,2020-9-26,1,1,0
"So i'm not the most prolific reviewer nor am I under any illusion that anyone gives a darn what I think about anything. However, I spent a ton of time agonizing over the decision between getting the Bose NC-700s and the XM3's last year and went with the NC-700s, which I've used consistently for over a year. So I'm thinking my experience might at least be helpful for those trying to decide.  In a bit more than a week of consistent usage of the XM4's, there is categorically NO CONTEST between the two headsets for one major reason.The key difference is that the XM4's JUST WORK. Initial setup was hilariously easy, to be sure (not so much with Bose, but that's a one time thing). Connecting and disconnecting from various devices is a breeze and works consistently. Contrast that with the NC-700's, which would constantly have a clicking noise when connected to two devices (a critical need for me when working from home). On top of that, they developed this bizarre issue where phone calls would drop from the headset to the handset at random and i'd have to manually shift it back to the headset. If you use Google Assistant, I've found the button on the XM4's to work consistently, unlike the one on the NC-700's.  When connected to multiple devices, the XM4's can tell where they need to play from with no trouble. The NC-700's would need to be disconnected and reconnected to show them where to play from, which was lots of fun when hopping onto conference calls for work.",5,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
"In a nutshell, a buggy product. Save your money and buy the Sony WH-1000XM3 or a Bose.I was super excited to get XM4. So much so, I waited almost a year to get my hands on it. The reason? Because it would be a great substitute for my Bose QuietComfort 35 II, which pairs seamlessly to several devices without any issues. The previous version of this headphones (i.e. XM3) had amazing sound, but lack this important feature of connecting to different devices.",1,1,2020-9-3,1,1,0
"Headphones are all about compromise, like most things in life. I have several sets for different use cases and these are the most expensive, though not by much. It's important to realize that a good chunk of the money you spend on these is not going to sound quality, per se. You're paying for good battery life, good noise cancelling, decent build quality, multi-device wireless radios, the speak-to-mute trick, and the new proximity sensor. Sound quality is subjective, but I found it awful with the EQ off and didn't like any of the presets. I took me two days to find a setting I was just okay with and the sound is kinda bad in comparison to my wired B&O H6s. I personally even like my Jaybird Vistas more, though those fatigue my ear canals during extended use. That said, I fully expected this as they are all about comfort and active cancellation for noisy environments and in these categories they are great. The feeling of putting them on and suddenly being in your own bubble of quiet is very cool, but again, that's what you're paying for. The talk to mute function is very cool, but is slightly pointless because it's frankly just rude to talk to people with your headphones still on.Pros:",4,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0
"After a lot of research and watching raving reviews, I decided to buy these over the Bose NC 700's for Sonys supposed superior, richer soundstage and stronger noise cancelling despite the Bose winning out in call audio quality in every test. However, upon putting my Sonys on and listening to music (in a wide variety of genres) I could tell immediately that the sound in the lows up to the mids was *extremely* muddy and not clear. The bass was way too punchy to be enjoyable as well (Don't be fooled, I love bass heavy music). I also realized that the customizable EQ feature doesn't have much control over tuning the problem frequencies (lows, mids). After more research and listening to more audio quality and call quality videos, I ended up returning these and buying the much cheaper and better audio quality Sennheiser PXC ii's (with the same amount of battery life).",3,1,2020-9-14,1,2,0

I know they'll start shredding apart in a year or two.  I'll be sure to clean these daily to see if that helps.  I will also search the questions for cleaning recommendations by Sony (or post if none found).",5,1,2020-8-26,1,1,0
I had high hopes for these as they are so highly rated. Please be aware that if you use with an iPhone they won’t start things with google assistant only open the app. That basically defeats the purpose of an assistant and I’m stuck still using AirPod pros with Siri instead. I think if you’re an android user you’ll love these though. The sound quality is very good and so is the noise cancellation. The main reason I wanted this was to be able to switch from Siri to google assistant on my iPhone and unfortunately it’s still too soon for that.,3,1,2020-8-22,1,1,0
"I can't say enough good things about these new Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Headphones.  Honestly, it's like baby Jesus singing to you in Heaven.

Crystal clear, COMPLETE noise cancelling, deep base, customizable equalizer in the iPhone app, 30 hours of battery life, super fast charging and COMFORTABLE!!!!  Did I say COMFORTABLE?  Because these babies are like being cradled in the bosom of Dolly Parton at end of a long night.  Mama MIA they are some soft and easy headphones.  Seriously, there is not ONE THING I would change about these. Maybe a longer charging cord (it's only about 6 inches - that's what she said) but seriously, give me at least a foot (that's also what she said). Sony knocked it out of the park with this unit.  $349 is a pretty steep price.  PRETTY, PRETTY STEEP.  But if you enjoy hearing TV and music crystal clearly, while drowning out the droning sounds of your air conditioner blowing full blast, the dogs barking, the wife yelling, the kids crying, the doorbell ringing, the phone texting, IT'S WORTH IT.

They were pretty easy to sync your phone suggest to download the app it finishes the setup and recommend to download the software update. Maybe the following headphones will come with that update and you won’t need to do anything. The software update is also easy and syncs automatically so you don’t have to connect them to any computer or anything.Worth every penny.

"All around excellent headphones, with class-leading noise cancellation. I will still be using my Jabra 65E for Calls and Skype (better mics) but these are my go-too for everything else.Sitting with a window fan 3ft away, dishwasher (cheap and loud) 10Ft away and the window open near a freeway(15 Meters away) I can all but escape the insane levels of noise in my dining room office.",5,1,2020-8-27,1,1,0
"I have been using these for a little over a month now, and have not experienced any issues. The sound and noise cancelation quality are great, and the microphone is OK. When I first received, I was having issues connecting and switching to a 2nd connected device but after a couple of app updates, it seems to have corrected the problem. The sound and microphone quality are not as great as my Bose 700s; when compared with the Bose, others have indicated that my voice comes through a bit clearer and more isolated than with the Sony XM4s. The fit on the Bose is slightly more comfortable and lighter than the XM4s also. I do appreciate the touch sensor functionality and ease of use over the Bose, as well as the capability to customize the sound and adaptive technology. Overall, my preference are these over my Bose 700s for ease of use and seamless transition between two connected devices (laptop and mobile phone). But for extended use with connectivity to only one device, then my preference is for the Bose because they are more comfortable to wear for long periods at a time. It's also important to note the battery life is much longer with these  than the Bose (can use for several days without re-charge vs. 6 - 8 hours with the Bose).",5,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0

Solid headphones, but they'd always hurt my ears and get a bit hot to wear over time.Skipping out on the m3s, when I saw the Mrs coming out I thought it was a good time to upgrade.  I was right, these things are great. Very comfy, excellent sound quality and very solidly built.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,2,0
"I got these 6 hours ago, and they are still on my ears. The noise-cancellation works really well, I can barely hear the keys when I type. Definitely need to try them on tidal hifi or deezer.

"The noise-canceling is good, better than most, but the audio is horrid. If you're used to audiophile headphones, you will cringe when you put these on. They do not come close to mid-range Audio-Technica, Sennheiser, or AKG. Even the Audio-Technica m40x sound better than these.Don't waste your money on these, they're overpriced. Get a low-end set of Etymotic's if you want to close the world off from external sound.",2,1,2020-9-6,1,1,0
"It was so embarrassing when you colleagues frequently said ""I can't hear you"", ""you looks far away"", ""you're cutting off""...in many meetings when I use this newly bought headset, especially when it came to a point you have to speak up for an important topic.I was so pissed-off by Sony...you had delivered a remarkable sound quality headset, why couldn't you figure out how to truly improve the call quality  - is MIC so difficult?",2,1,2020-9-2,1,2,0
Great headphones that I've found to be a tremendous value even at the relatively-high cost. Battery lasts for ages.The most pleasant surprise has been the ability to simultaneously pair these headphones with multiple devices. Can seamlessly switch between my iPhone and Mac without having to mess around with any bluetooth settings. Huge improvement over even Apple's first-party products (my AirPods Pro now only get used when I'm out and about).,5,1,2020-8-26,1,1,0

"So, I was skeptical coming from Bose that anyone could beat their noise cancelling ability and comfort, but I kid you not...I love these Sony headphones. I wore them all day today and my ears are not sore one bit, additionally the noise cancelling is awesome, I didn't hear a peep in the background. They performed excellent via bluetooth on my conference calls, which is a big win vs the Bose QC. If Sony continues to innovate like this I may just continue to purchase their next gen headphones.",5,1,2020-8-19,1,2,0

"Working from home can be distracting when you have a toddler running about.  When my wife and daughter are around, it tends to get noisy.  I have the Sony WF-1000XM3 earbuds and the noise cancelling is pretty okay on those but connecting/disconnecting my phone or laptop to get them working between each other got tedious.  So when I found out from MKBHD that the XM4s have multiple device support!  I was sold.  These are my first over the ear noise cancelling headsets so I do not have further comparison but from my experience is, that these are great for cancelling out a lot of noise.  My daughter and my wife are muffled if around my workspace.  Like someone said in one of their reviews, its like being in your personal bubble or vacuumed space.  Sometimes the silence is weird when there's not much going on around me.  So far I'm happy with this headset.  It's pretty light and comfy.  The ear cups are not so bad but when it gets hot, you tend to sweat a bit but I heard tha's unavoidable in most of these type of over the ear headsets.  Great buy in my opinion",4,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0
"My intended usage was connection to my computer to deal with daily dose of WFH induced conference calls. The sound either from conf calls was horrible... I tried to blame it on the call quality first. It could not be the headphones... not at that price... not from Sony... so I decided to try with music local on my computer... The sound was horrible... Probably a combination of noise cancellation self cancelling and other factors... But for that price, I expect perfection... Returned the item got refund (that process of return was perfect and easy, with UPS pick up from the door step).",1,1,2020-8-29,1,2,0

"I researched many headphones, and almost went with a pair much more expensive, but decided to give these a try, due to their apparent value.  Very glad I did!  The audio quality is superb.  I noticed when pair with my shield tv, the video pauses automatically when removing the headphones, and resumes automatically when putting them back on.  Very convenient.  Love that you can adjust the volume by just swiping your finger along the side, without any buttons present.  Gives the headphones a very nice, clean look without the presence of actual volume buttons.",5,1,2020-9-22,1,1,0
At first I wasn’t sure if it was worth upgrading as I thought the XM3s were already perfect but Sony went ahead and made everything even better. What’s not to love? I never write reviews but this is so enjoyable I couldn’t help myself. 5 stars easily. The instrument separation is very noticeable compared to the previous model. Everything is in its right place. Fat AND clear. A lot of headphones focus on one or the other. I want it all and these headphones give me everything I need. It’s nice to hear everything in its own place and not all in the same place stuck together if that makes sense. I did love the way the XM3s glued the instruments together in a way but these new headphones definitely give me more of an honest mix. Sony made the best Bluetooth headphones even better so just do yourself a favor and buy them.,5,1,2020-8-28,1,1,0
The product has good sound equivalent to a Bose headphone and the noise cancellation is close. However the blue tooth connection makes this product almost useless. I am used to Bose headphones after set up pairing automatically. The Sony headphone must be connected to the phone or computer manually every time. Even though I am 2 feet away from the source the music skips and  disconnects requiring a manual reconnect every 10 -15 minutes. This is a very expensive headphone and having this connection problem makes this a clearly inferior product.  It has superior sound and noise cancellation and if you use this on a cable there is no problem. However if you plan to use blue tooth do not under any circumstance buy this product. You will simply have to send its back and reorder a Bose or other product. Caveat Emptor !,1,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0
"Replaced my Bose QC35 II with this headphone and I have to say I’m very impressed but not totally satisfied. It’s comfortable and all but not as light as Bose. The process of pairing it with my iPhone was tedious and takes sometime to re-connect after first use. I also have to click the power button for few seconds to turn it on which is stupid. My ears felt warm when I wore them the first couple days but am now used to that and it doesn’t bother me anymore. I think that’s because I’m so used to Bose as I was wearing it for the past two years. As for sound, XM4 offers the best sound I have ever experienced which makes every little annoying detail obsolete.  I also purchased another unit for my GF and she also had very hard time pairing it herself I was afraid I’ll have to return it but the pairing issue was fixed when we used Sony’s app rather than directly from Bluetooth. It’s worth buying but pay attention to these little annoying details.",5,1,2020-8-28,1,1,1
"I have used Bose in-ear noise-canceling headphones for a while. I wanted to try an over the ear headphone. After a long time reviewing my option, I decided to buy a Sony headphone. It came, and I used it for about two weeks; here are what I found.It is a great headphone overall. It has a lot of bells and whistles in its app. However, I am not a fan of having so many options. Especially when they are not being set right by default. I give you an example. It has a multipoint connection feature, which is a good thing to have.",3,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
"I recently bought these and I had high expectations.

"Started to emit static noise from right ear cup, seems it’s a common issue with M3 and M4 of these headsets. Will be returning mine, and sticking to my old Sennheiser Momentum 2s. The noise cancellation was not that great compared to others in the market, but the sound quality was great. My battery life was not good, about 1/2 as advertised... not sure if I just got overall defective unit.",2,1,2020-9-1,1,1,0
Dislikes - no plug for charging ; only a charging cord which is only 5 -6 inches in length. Chrome plated jacks instead of gold plating - thrifty considering the price.  Hard to access or identify volume controls on the headphones; Noise cancellation is decent if playing music; not so much when listening to an audiobook or conferencing.  Don’t know if it is superior or equal to the Bose noise cancelling.  Weight of headphones surprisingly and pleasantly light.  Fast charging is a plus.  Unable to determine if headphones can be synced to multiple devices.  A bit of a challenge to get it to sync with my iPad had to move to a room where other Bluetooth devices did not interfere.  This could be because I have an older model iPad.  Not sure whether the better buy would have been the previous model. Some static or background noise experienced when shifting from ambient on/off/noise cancellation.  Bought it over the Bose because it seemed better material design than the latest Bose quiet comforts which appear to be built using low cost materials. Controls are placed on the left headphone which is disconcerting for a right handed person like me.  Power on/off button continually failing; I have to plug headphones into the usb plug to get it to power back on even though it’s fully charged.  Reconnecting to apparently older devices is a chore and frustrating.  Will probably return before the return period expires.,3,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"I’ve owned the 2nd and 3rd gen versions of these headphones and the 4th gen is the best yet. I don’t like that the 3D audio feature is only supported by Tidal and a couple other apps. Other than that nit-picky feedback, I highly recommend.",5,1,2020-9-1,1,1,0
"even worse when paired with Windows 10 and iTunes on top of that. I get it's partly my fault for still using iTunes in Windows (because I also use Apple devices and like the cloud backup) but bluetooth headphones are simply unreliable when trying to use them with WIndows 10 and/or iTunes. To be clear, I have gotten all three to work together before, but only after hours of trying. I got these headphones to wear comfortably all day while I work, and it's nice to be able to roam around the house while still hearing everything, but unfortunately my old wireless gaming headset will still see more use while these gather cobwebs until I start traveling on planes again",2,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0

I wish that the call quality and build quality were a bit better though.

I love everything under the rainbow with these headphones. The sound quality and battery life are unbelievable. The only issues I have is that these headphones are meant to be wore for an extended amount of time. Maybe it's my head size/shape but my ears start killing my ears after an hour use. I also wish the touch sensitive side was a bit more sensitive and easier to rub my finger across. It's great but could be better.  I'd like to see a more glassy feel where your finger slides across with ease. I know I am nit picking but for the price I should be able to. All in all great headphones for rarity of uses.,5,1,2020-10-3,1,1,0

My earbuds can do a better job blocking out noise. Anyway, so I sent that pair back through Amazon to get it replaced, and the second pair that I received had the exact same issue.

"Just got these and not sure I am going to keep them.One big feature I got these was for Noise Cancelling.  But compared to my Bose QC35s these things are loud when canceling noise.  It sounds like distant traffic.  In comparison the QC35s are silent.  Since I bought these to create a dead zone when I work or sleep, these may not work for me.",3,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"Good Noise cancelling. Music sound is a bit heavy on the bass. When on Zoom the voice of other people does sound a bit muffled. Fairly comfortable to wear, being over the ear they do feel a bit warm in hot environments. Battery life is amazing.

I’ve been wasting money on cheaper headphones for years. You get what you pay for. Listening to music has never sounded better and finally headphones I can use while working - I hear them and they hear me. I can walk very far from my phone and they stay connected.

It’s finally here and a worthwhile successor to the amazing M3.  So I will start by saying that currently my go to headphones are the M3 but my favorite headphones over the last 5 years have been the Bose QC 35 II.  These however are going to be my main pair especially for use doing work from home.The battery seems to charge in about the same time and have the same life span which is around 30 hours and pretty incredible.  So here is what I have noticed listening to the M3 versus the M4.  I am glad they kept the M3 design which I personally like more than the Bose 700.  The ear cushion feels a little more comfortable and is a little bigger making the comfortable M3 just a little more comfortable but there doesn’t seem to be a huge difference. Hopefully the padding holds up as well as the M3 has as mine still are incredible shape despite a lot of use.  The M4 also changed the NC/Ambient button on the M3 to a Custom which for me was not really necessary but it will allow you to make that button programmable through the app to do what you want which maybe a welcome change for some users. There is also a proximity sensor inside the ear to support the new feature “Auto Pause” which I think can be really helpful.  The idea is that once you take the earphones off it will immediately pause what you are listening too and that normally works great.  However this did not work a few times when I lifted my earphones to the top of my head which makes sense because the sensor was reading my hair inside the cushion as if it was ear.  I tend to shift my headphones this way at times when I take them off but when I took them completely off or had them around my neck it worked great.  I like it better than using the touch pad outside the ear as honestly I have never used that feature that much because of it misreading my touch and skipping something I was watching.  The touch pad is indeed back and for those who use it all the swipes seem to have the same function.,5,0,2020-8-18,1,1,0

"To Dennis who gave this two stars, you need a new set of ears or u got a bad set of cans. Super biased. While the OG qc35s IIs were the good standard 10 years ago, these kick its ass 100x over in nearly every single department.Sound? This wins.",5,0,2020-8-26,1,1,0
"I've tried quite a few of headphones, especially recently. These headphones are by far the best of all. I got into the WH series headphones for the first time with the XM2's. Once I got those I decided I needed headphones of that quality for the rest of my life. I upgraded to the XM3's when they came out, and now the XM4's.The noise cancellation on these things is unbeatable. It always has been with the Sony WH headphones. My favorite feature on the new version is the automatic pause when someone starts talking. Sometimes my girlfriend yells for me or comes in my office while I'm working and starts talking and these make it so much easier to hear her the first time.",5,0,2020-9-12,1,1,0
These headphones are amazing. Now I don’t have to much feed back on noise cancellation because this is only the 2nd pair of noise cancellation headphones I’ve owned but I’m happy with it once I have these on just the sound warp of noise cancellation activating is somewhat mind boggling I get scared sometimes when it activates lol but overall I’m happy with these very comfortable wearing for long periods. Stay on during a workout. Love the speech recognition on it meaning though I can’t hear really anything around if someone tries to get my attention and I begin talking the headphones will adjust and I can hear clearly. Lots of features on here using the app helps adjust to perfect settings. Case that comes with headphones is nice as well includes aux cable if you are planning to use wired. Overall I would definitely recommend these headphones. I’m happy overall with them.,5,0,2020-9-10,1,1,0
"Sony's new WH-1000XM4 active noise-canceling headphones are incredibly disappointing given their hefty price tag ($348 on Amazon at the time of this review) and the fact that these are apparently meant to be top-of-the-line.  For that kind of money, you expect excellent sound, effective noise-canceling, and premium build quality but Sony delivers on none of the three.The sound when playing uncompressed music files is clear and crisp but with little presence or life--my two-year-old Bluedio Victory Pro headphones sound way better.  I tried using an equalizer to liven up the sound without success.  I also tried an audiophile music player called Power Amp Pro that offers a number of customized sound options including completely bypassing the phone's default sound processing in favor of higher quality processing built into the app but that did little to improve sound quality.  Bypassing the sound processing built into my smartphone almost completely eliminated Sony's noise-canceling which suggests the WH-1000XM4 is relying more on the combination of Sony's Android app and my phone's hardware for noise-canceling than on hardware actually built into the headphones.",2,0,2020-10-1,1,0,0
"The noise cancelling is the best I have ever experienced, I feel so isolated that they will take getting used to in a good way.  I vacillated between these and the Bose QC 35, and originally chose the Bose.  Although the Bose connected to my iphone without any issues, and were so comfy, they would not connect to my HP Spectre Win 10 laptop.  Since one of my main use cases was Zoom calls in noisy environments, this was a show stopper.  I spent time reading blog posts and trying to make it work, but in the end returned them.By contrast, I opened the Sony box, turned on the fully charged headphones, and they connected to my laptop instantly.  I launched a zoom call and all was well.  For this reason alone, I highly recommend these for comfort, ease, ability to have two connections (phone and laptop) and ability to connect to Win 10 devices.",5,0,2020-9-5,1,1,0

I really wanted to pull the cable in and out to get an exact reference to with and without bluetooth, but every time I unplugged it, it unpaired and shut off.  It also kills the tilt to pause function when they're plugged in.",5,0,2020-9-3,1,0,1

"It has been more than a decade since I last owned and used Sony noise-cancelling headphones, so I was particularly interested in their most recent developments when acquiring these headphones.  My background as a long-time audiophile and FCC licensed broadcast engineer who regularly tested and evaluated high-end audio equipment for a leading component stereo retailer is the experience I bring to this review.In my opinion the most important feature of any brand of headphones is the quality of sound.  Without great sound I don't believe that any of the other features matter much.  I am pleased to report that these headphones deliver a true, sweet, wide-spectrum palate of sound from the highest audible frequencies to the lowest head-rattling bass.  Another good measure of sound quality is lack of ""listener fatigue.""  Even inaudible distortion can cause listeners to become weary of listening.  These headphones can deliver a full day and evening of exceptional Bluetooth sound from a single battery charge.",5,0,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"I've heard a lot of wonderful things about the Sony noise cancelling sets like these, and let me tell you: it isn't just hype. The sound quality is excellent, and the noise cancelling is eerily amazing. I put it on my wife and kids with the noise cancelling off and then turned it on to demonstrate, and you can see each them suddenly smile like ""whoa"".  Like my Sony studio headphones I use professionally for work, the actual fidelity of the sound it reproduces is excellent, and the microphone for calls is excellent despite being up by my ears and so far from my mouth (other bluetooth headphones I've tried were good for music only, the mic being up by my ears wasn't good enough to isolate my voice from ambient sound, but this definitely does a great job).The app gives a ton of control beyond what I expected to really customize the experience. For example, I have mine set to auto-pause if the headphones are removed, and to turn off noise cancelling when it detects me speaking to someone, and then resume playback when the headphones are removed/replaced. These features are all customizable, as well as many more. But you need the app. And this is where the cons come in:",4,0,2020-9-9,1,0,1
"Update 2:On Sept 7th Sony released a software update. This update improved the overall connection issues that I reported earlier. Even with that, there's a learning curve, but it took me just a few minutes to get used to with it.  I think this update will make these more useful, let's wait and see.",3,0,2020-8-22,1,3,0
"Bose has nothing on the new Sony 1000MX4. I wish I could go back and get all my money back in the three bose headphones that I have to replace them with these. The battery life is better than most and the quality of music is well surpassing the other claimed ""best in class"". I use them all the time for my phone calls at the office, or traveling across the world for work without even thinking twice on having to charge them for my travels. I don't use them to workout as I think these are too precious to do so. Hope you guys enjoy them.",5,0,2020-8-19,1,6,0
"I previously owned the WHXB900N headphones from Sony, and my experience with them was good. I decided to take the chance to upgrade to the WH-1000XM4, and I am glad that I did. The WH-1000XM4 is a major upgrade, and a lot of my complaints about the WHXB900N have been addressed in the WH-1000XM4.First of all, the packaging for the WH-1000XM4 is great. You get a carrying case with accessories and the headphones. There is space created in the case to store the headphones flat as well as the extra cables and connectors, as well as a handy guide that shows the touch functions on the headphones.",5,0,2020-8-30,1,1,0

"First and foremost, the sound quality is excellent. These create an immersive and detailed experience, with a somewhat warm but balanced sound on the default equalizer setting. The highs are crisp, and bass is powerful.The active noise cancelling on these headphones is life-changing. I’m the sort of person who prefers to work in the quiet reading room of the library with earplugs in, and when I am l seeking to truly focus on a problem, I don’t want reminders that there’s anyone else in the universe. Since the transition to work-from-home, my Tasco Nextera passive ear muffs have become key to my sanity while sharing the house with others, sometimes with earbuds snaking underneath for music while I work. For eliminating sounds in the vocal range plus general household noises, these Sony headphones are actually superior when noise cancelling is on, while the 20 different levels of ambient sound control let me fine tune my desired situational awareness when I’m not trying to hyperfocus. I haven’t had any issues with eardrum suck.",5,0,2020-9-6,1,1,0
"These M4 headphones are an update to the highly-regarded (“industry leading”) M3s. They continue to place their emphasis on sound. Of course, you can use them to greatly reduce the background noise. If at home, it might be appliances or traffic; at the office, perhaps the constant drone of other voices. I even used them while using a shop vac, and I was impressed at how much it reduced the noise.If you use them to listen to music, you will appreciate how they use Artificial Intelligence to flesh out your lossy .mp3s. It works quite well, adjusting to different music. I was amazed at how much detail I was able to hear",5,0,2020-9-1,1,1,0
"Wow, Sony really upped the game for noise-cancelling headphones. These pretty much have everything you might want in over-the-ear headphones. They're very comfortable to wear for long periods of time, the active noise cancellation works great (and can be customized in Sony's app), and the sound quality is awesome. I have the older M3's (which are also great), but the overall sound quality on the M4's seems better. Where I especially notice a difference is on phone calls - the package mentions that the M4's now have 5 microphones to pick up your voice more clearly.There are some cool new features that makes these more convenient also. Cupping your hand over the right headphone lowers the volume so that you can hear what's going on around you better. There is also a ""speak-to-chat"" function that pauses what you're listening to when you start talking. I probably won't use that one much, though, as it is pretty sensitive and seems to pause when someone is talking loudly nearby, and occasionally coughs.",5,0,2020-8-31,1,1,0

"I could write pages on how amazing these Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones are, Lets start by the noise canceling, and it's something beyond my wildest dreams, it's like magic, once enabled you literally hear nothing, like as if you went deaf. But it still can pick if someone is next to you and speaking very loud but that's I think a leak from the ear seal, it depends how tight the headphones are on your head.Design is the same as the the Mark 3 but this one has one big hole in the back of each earcup for a better noise cancelling experience, and it has a little sensor inside the left ear cup to pause music once you take off the headset, so I think it's some kind of proximity sensor.",5,0,2020-10-4,1,0,0

"I want to start this review by stating that I absolutely LOVE Sony!  I have been using Sony products for over 30 years and have been extremely impressed with this new headphone technology they have released.  I Have severe hearing loss and wear Phonak hearing aids to compensate for the high end frequencies loss. That being said, not only the sound quality is important for me, but also comfort  as well because it is difficult to have something in or over your ears with the hearing aids in.  This was such a great experience for me because this is the first pair of headphones that is 100% comfortable and also give me great sound since I can wear them with the hearing aids in. All around these are very responsive to touch control and noise.  The touch functions of the headphones is very easy to use and I find I use it all the time to pause and change songs. I love the 'cover your right ear'' function that will bring the level down immediately so you can hear your surroundings.  OK, so there is also the new 360 Reality audio feature to be used with the specific apps.  I was skeptical about how much improvement it could make and really didn't want another music app.  I used the app to take pictures of my ears so they can adapt the music to the shape and then set up the music app.  WOW, I can't believe how much better the music sounds that I only listen to music through the 360 reality audio app(Deezer is what I chose). I am actually going to continue with a subscription because I really dont want to listen to music any other way now with my headphones. The music sounds so amazing like im right there in the studio.  I really can't recommend these headphones enough. Go buy them you will not be dissapointed at all. Thanks Sony for an amazing product!",5,0,2020-9-18,1,0,1
"I'm not a headphones guy.  I almost exclusively use canal-phones and have tried lots of middle-road varieties such as V-Moda, 1-More, Klipsch, Shure (high end).  I have never really found the pair of headphones that could hang with the canal phones for quality and noise isolation.  Boom!  These just changed my entire view of headphones.  They are super soft and comfortable, and light.  They do tend to fall off if you are trying to wear while laying down which makes them tricky for the gym.  When the noise cancellation kicks in, it is like you got teleported to outer space.  It's just ridiculously good - like 95% decrease in ambient sound.  I haven't tried them while mowing yet, but that's next.  The sound quality is the best I have ever heard.  The software walks you through the setup process very nicely, including taking pictures of your ears for some sort of optimization...I'm skeptical and didnt get to compare before and after.  Anyway, all cool stuff.  the controls on the side take a bit of getting used to but are fairly intuitive.  Hard-wire cable presumably for PC access is fine, probably wont be used.  The battery life is just unbelievable!  30 hours is bananas.I'm usually not a pay-top-dollar for the best of best kinda guy.  I'm usually a pay half and get 95% kinda guy, but man...I'm not sure that there's a 95% option out there.  These are in a league of their own.  I didnt think I needed them before I got them, but now I probably wont leave home without them.",5,0,2020-9-8,1,0,0

"The build quality and sound of these headphones is good and worthy of the price tag.  However, that's about where it stops in terms of price justification.  Noise cancelling does an okay job but I've had similar or better results from cheaper noise cancelling headphones (and even better from the bose earbuds).  The real downfall comes from the connection issues.  The bluetooth on these is absolutely terrible.  Constant connection drops, the 2 device connection is nowhere near seamless, and the app rarely recognizes that I'm connected to the phone.  I also occasionally experience what other reviews have stated with the 1-2 second audio delay when watching youtube videos (and these are my only headphones this happens with).  Realistically these headphones are probably a 3 star in terms of quality, but they only get a 1 star from me for sheer disappointment and not coming close to justifying the expensive price tag.  I should've gone with my gut and my usual brand of choice, the Bose QC35ii",1,0,2020-9-8,1,2,0

"I own the previous XM3s. The new XM4s have less bass and are more clear but I actually preffer how the XM3s sound due to their bass. The music sounds more alive on the XM3s.Also they removed the Arena, Concert Hall, etc modes from the Sony app which was my favorite thing when watching movies (I used to put arena mode and it sounded like a movie theatre).

"I bought these headphones from another store and realized that:Such expensive and premium headphones come with an aux (audio) cable which has no built in mic in the cable. Yes, the audio cable doesn’t have any microphone. I wanted to use these headphones via Bluetooth on my phone and via the cable on my laptop while gaming & editing to have 0 latency.

"I have historically not been a massive fan of noise-cancelling headphones.  I mean, the idea is simple... take an input sound, send it 180 degrees out of phase (and at the same amplitude), let destructive interference do its thing, and combine it with the waveform of the sound you actually want the user to hear.  Simple, right?  Well, sound comes from different directions, is attenuated to different degrees by the headphones/your head/etc., has some intrinsic latency added in the sound processing, headphone frequency response limitations, driver frequency response limitations, and about a million other technical issues.  However, the Sony WH-1000XM4 are highly rated, right?  I wanted to see how they'd do...The Sony WH-1000XM4 arrives in a surprisingly small box.  This is because business travelers are frequently targeted for noise-canceling headphones, so the retail packaging is roughly the size of the hard-sided carry case located inside.  The tilt/swivel/rotate articulation of the headband allows for the headphones to be broken down into a very compact 8.5x6x2"" case.  Accomplishing this requires smaller ear cups than I'm used to.  My ears fit inside, but they: 1.) aren't that large, and 2.) weren't as comfortable as in some headphones that are more spacious.  This is subjective, and YMMV.  Comfort is about a 7/10, but I noticed that they felt quite warm (from my head, not from the electronics) after about 20 minutes.  Not terrible, but not awesome.  Side note: I got mine in ""silver"", which is really just grey.",4,0,2020-9-17,1,2,0
"OK so the sound is next level as expected LDAC codec (on Androids) and DSEEX upscaler for Apple devices... :Chef's kiss: Noise canceling is great too. But for $300+ great sound isn't enough is it? So let's get to the cons1. Call quality is hit or miss. Some people I heard fine, others sounded like 60% volume. Some people heard me fine others not so much especially if I was browsing while talking - and yeah that can have an effect on call quality but I do the same with my Samsung Galaxy Buds+ and have zero issues with call quality and they are half the price of this.",4,0,2020-9-25,1,0,1
"I bought this from a local retailer. I am most interested in the active noise cancelling. So, when I received them, I set about testing the ANC using some noise videos on YouTube, mostly looking at airplane noise and road noise. I have the Bose 700 headphones. Video reviews claimed the XM4 ANC is better than the Bose 700 ANC. Yes and no. After carefully evaluating the XM4s, I found that there is a noticeable difference between the left ear ANC and right ear ANC. The left ear didn't block noise as well as the right ear and gave a lopsided feel to the ANC effectiveness. The Bose ANC is absolutely balanced, left is as good as the right. I used a single earplug to isolate each ear in turn. When doing that, I found the XM4 had better ANC in the right ear, but in the left ear the Bose ANC was better. This was done after the latest software update to the XM4, and I don't know if that affected the ANC in some way.  Admittedly, if I was listening to music also, I likely wouldn't detect a difference between ears since the music would mask ambient sound. The the difference, once recognized, is obvious and annoying.  Was this a problem with my particular XM4 headphone or a characteristic of all XM4 headphones?  I don't know. I returned my XM4 the same day I got them.  Perhaps I'll try again with another XM4 headphone from Amazon. For now I can only say that the XM4 loses to the Bose 700 for ANC. The XM4 would be the winner if not for the problem with the left ear.On another note, I found the XM4 to be less comfortable than the Bose, mostly due to the use of softer materials in the Bose, and most noticeable with the headband on the top of the head. This might resolve with use. I notice that the headband padding on the Bose, which I have had for 3 1/2 months, has conformed a bit to my head, which would make it a bit more comfortable.  Adjusting the headband is also easier on the Bose. But, I like how the XM4 headband flairs out less than the Bose headband.",3,0,2020-8-21,1,2,0
"Headset is fairly lightweight, ear cups aren’t as deep as some headphones but deep enough for my average sized ears.  Cups are soft and the overall comfort level is high, even after extended play time.The touch controls on the ear cup are very slick and help reduce the number of physical buttons.  However, taking the headphones off (or putting them on), I’ve accidentally turned music on as it mistook the contact as a command.  Not a deal breaker but a quirk to be aware of.  The auto-pause when you remove the headphones is a nice touch too.",5,0,2020-9-4,1,2,0
"I have had the headphones for a few weeks and this my initial impression.  I have  owned multiple Bose over the years (QC25, QC35, and QC35 II) and I have owned many lower end Sonys.  A couple items that were a con for me.  First the noise cancelling works well, but it does mess with my ears more than the Bose do.  QC25 is still favorite noise cancelling. The other is I had issues connecting them to Windows 10 PC via bluetooth.  They would connect but were not seen as an audio device.  On the positive side, the sound is excellent.  I believe the sound is more well rounded than Bose. Sony provides more bass.  The headphones are very comfortable and I have no issue wearing them for hours as long as turn noise cancelling for some of that time.  The app provides great flexibility for adjusting the headphones.  I like the option for noise cancelling automatically turning off when I speak.Sony has made an impressive pair of headphones with the Sony WH-1000XM4.  The premium quality and features justify the premium price.  I would defintiely recommend them",4,0,2020-9-29,1,0,0

"I was weary hearing the comparison tests between these and the other big brand. I've owned several mid range headphones and these are by far the best ones I've tried. Just putting them on the noise cancellation is amazing. I sore these as a backseat passenger a few weeks ago on a 5 hour trip. The people in the front carried on a conversation and I didnt hear a word.Sound quality is nice and crisp. Midrange might lack a bit but moat people wouldn't catch that. The EQ in the app lets you get the perfect sound for your ears. The bass is really good and pretty realistic. The highs hit really good and are well balanced. There are several cool features available in the app. When you remove these from your head,  you have the option to have your music stop. It also stops if you start talking. So integration with Google and Alexa is awesome. Overall I haven't heard of anyone being disappointed in these headphones and would recommend them to anyone.",5,0,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"I loved the XM3s and the XM4s are even better. Love the added features that the XM3s fell short on. Sound quality sounds more balance on the XM4s and love how they pause when you start talking or take them off. Active Noise Canceling seems to be much better, getting rid of more sudden noise or higher pitched noises. Even the touch controls feel more responsive than the XM3s. Incredible incredible product. Purchased elsewhere due to shipping times. These cans are the rear deal.EDIT: Used these with my Samsung TV, and no matter what I try and what wifi devices I turn off, its still a choppy un-synced terrible experience. Sony wants to replace them at no charge, but I'll need to send them back and after 7-10 business days I'll get an exchange. I have 4 Samsung TV in my home and they all do the same.

I have other phones that link to my cell phone and computer simultaneously. This is extremely useful for when I have the phones on for online work meetings, and a call comes in.

"I received these a couple of weeks ago and have spent several evenings with them since.  I took the entire fist evening (and then some) getting the WH-1000XM4 set up, updated, synced, and dialed in, then settled in for almost 6 hours listening across a variety of music sources and types, ranging from radio to highest-quality, uncompressed audio.  I also spent time on the chat function, headset (telephone) functions, and the accompanying app (IOS, in my case).  I've used them most nights since then, and they have replaced my usual go-to Sony MDR-V6 set in the bedroom.  (I keep another MDR-V6 set in the office, and a nice Panasonic headset in the family room.)The entire design approach to these headphone is subtlety, and EVERYTHING on the headset is black except the ""Sony"" on each cup and the rims of the top mic ports, all of which are copper-colored.  They are *beautifully* designed and made, every contour blending, every joint free-moving, every surface soft touch.  Their comfort surpasses the design, if anything.  I had no discomfort of any kind over the continuous hours of using the headset, which is really exceptional.  No weight issues, no band pressure on the top of my head, no squeeze, no cup discomfort.

"I've been an avid Bose fan until last year when I purchased my very first Sony Headphones - XM3. Aside from its inability to connect to more than one device at a time, XM3 literally became my favorite for day-to-day use. I didn't think it was possible for my Bose QC35 to be replaced by a set of cans from another manufacturer, but it did. As such, I did not hesitate to pre-order XM4 because it came with a set of improvements and features that I desired.Unfortunately, I'm quite disappointed with XM4. Yes, it connects with multiple devices without issues. Yes, the sound quality is slightly better than XM3 (and Bose QC35, 700, PSB M4U2, and few others). Looks and feels the same as XM3, which are good things. HOWEVER, after less than a week of use, I began to notice this annoying wind sound on the left cup/side of the headphone. I thought I can pretend not to hear it, but do I have to for headphones that cost this much? This wind noise is noticeable to a point of significant distraction, defeating one of the purposes of the noise-canceling feature.",2,0,2020-8-28,1,3,0
"These headphones have been reviewed to death, so I am going to focus my review towards people like myself; non-audiophiles who have probably never considered dropping this much on headphones.Over the years I have been through my share of headphones, gradually upgrading from $10 wired ear buds to $100+ bluetooth headsets that I thought were ""premium"".

"Noise cancellation and audio quality are top notch. The bass is nice, clean, and punchy and the rest is pretty good for Bluetooth headphones.The issues I had and prompted a return for these cans is the mic quality and the touch controls. Pairing them with my desktop and laptops resulted in poor mic quality so Teams/Skype and discord are not usable since it uses a lower quality codec (AptX is GONE in the xm4's and the 3.5mm cable disables the mic). The touch controls aren't customizable so long scroll or short scroll for volume does not change the amount so it's tedious, and if you do it too quickly it skips songs or pauses.",3,1,2020-8-22,0,1,0

"The sound is lovely. Crisp, smooth, absolutely top tier. Could use better bass, but the bass is also deep. I'm dock points off because the ear pad sensors are finicky, and the headset kept powering off at max power and the blue tooth kept disconnecting. I was skeptical about the mics, but I was able to be heard very clearly over discord calls, so that's great. I would not recommend these at all for gaming, because when you speak, the headphones interrupt the sound/music, so chatting to teammates while listening for game audio is a no go. Which means not hearing enemies, potentially, or just enjoying the bgm. I'm not docking points for these, ultimately, not being for me, but for functionality. The design is smooth, very, very comfortable and nicely built, but some ideas were simply not executed very well and that's a shame.

SONY WH1000XM4, have been waiting for them, since got into wireless headphones 2 years ago, I have been using Airpods Gen 2 and Galaxy Buds. I can tell you, they freaking suck against this monster, bass is super clear, yet hits real hard. The music feels really deep and 3D. I am using the headphones with Samsung galaxy s10, and i have no troubles listing to spotify premium, no lags, no delays, I mean what did you expect for a 500$cad headphones? The fit is fantastic, you can go on really go music sessions and don't feel tired after listing to them at all.

"They are comfortable, sound good and that's it. there's your $500. the rest sucks. I expected better noise cancellation from a $500 headphone. Noise cancellation does everything but block stupid people laughing and talking besides me. thus, need to pump up the volume and possibly hurt my ears. I really regret my purchase after all the hype around these. reviews everywhere said they were the best. In my opinion, they are no better than my kids 50$ headphones. Yes, the sound is good. but I constantly hear this white noise in my ears. If i turn of noise cancellation, I hear people around me even loader than without headphones. it's really unpleasant. Seems Sony WANTS you to hear other people’s conversations. I get that sometimes on the move, near a street, you need to hear but then again, if I choose not too, that should be my choice.So my advice is do not by just because of the noise cancellation cause it’s not what it is. It does not cancel sound. It blocks certain noises but these noises when listening to music would not bother anyhow. Voices however need to be blocked out but are not. I actually even use then in the house for fun when I want to ease drop on my kids phone conversations when they are in their room. I hear them better with the headphone on as it amplifies other people’s voices. Great job on noise cancellation Sony!",1,1,2020-9-4,0,3,0

If you put it on, you are like in space, pin-drop silence. Mids and highs are good. The base is anyway sony's specialty.You can also set EQ in Sony app. The software update frequency is good, so shows Sony is dedicated to it. Speaking is detected smartly, so it can optionally let ambient  sound in for you to hear (It can be turned off).

Although it looks largely the same as the WH-1000XM3, it performs best when using the LDAC Bluetooth codec, which is supported by most modern android smartphones, but it also sounds decent when used with AAC codec. For me the best feature is the ability to pause when the headphone are removed. They are excellent at blocking outside sound and sound great for music or podcasts. The larger ear cups cover the ears comfortable. The strong base is a tight but not abusive strong. Easy Sony app available for the phone. Great ANC headphones",5,0,2020-9-19,1,1,1

"The touch control on my headphone stopped working, and I thought I received a bad unit. But later I figured out it was the wear detection. I wear the headphone with a skull cap, and the wear sensor doesn't work well with it. It thinks I'm not wearing it, so it automatically shuts down after a while and disables touch control. Without a cap, it works flawlessly, with the cap on, I have to disable Auto Shut-off in the app to make everything work.Besides that problem, it's an amazing headphone. It cancels more noise, is more comfortable, even multipoint support works better compared to Surface Headphones 2.

I personally haven’t experienced this since I do not own a mac, but plenty of people will tell you how bad it as at establishing a connection with mac devices. The issue that I have, that caused me to write this review is that these headphones will AUTOMATICALLY DISCONNECT (with no sound queue saying it’s disconnected just literally a complete silence followed by a beep) from bluetooth. This issue has persisted through factory resets, testing whether it was the PC or iPhone or Android that caused it (none of which had a problem with other devices but consistently had the headphones disconnect).

As these headphones are , I believe Sony's  top of the line Bluetooth Headphones I expected them to hold a Bluetooth connection with my TV.Amazon allowed me to return them easily, and reordered the Bose 700 wireless headphones . These met my expectations for the same price as the Sony wireless headphones . The Sony headphones may work great for other applications but were totally useless for using on a new Smart TV!!! .",1,1,2020-9-20,0,0,0
Great for winter people! They finally fixed the pad problem with the XM3 where it was bugging in cold weather. I've put them in the freezer (-18 C) for 10 minutes and they were perfectly fine! The pad was working great.,5,1,2020-9-9,0,1,0
"I've been using Bose 700 and Sony Xm3 for quite a time and need to say Sony were the pioneers when it come to ANC and they continue their leagacy with XM4 also. XM4 addresses what XM3 lags, The main thing I missed in my XM3's were dual device connect and it's been addressed here and small additions like speak to chat and touch controls make this my go to ANC period.However I still feel voice calls through Bose is still better than this and hope Sony tweaks it through future OTA.",5,1,2020-9-24,0,0,0
"Amazing Sound and comfy. Add a base shaker into your couch and movies or music videos are incredible. Take them off and the apartment is silent. Put them on and it sounds and feels like the entire apartment building is going to file a complaint. Bought a second pair , and a Bluetooth transmitter that will play both headphones at once.Just a suggestion on the base shaker, but trust me it’s a game changer.",5,1,2020-9-21,0,0,0

"I have been using the same pair of studio beats for 4 years and had to buy a new pair of wireless headphones. As these Sony mx4 were the highest rated I purchased them. Long story short I sent them back the same day. Sound is good, noise cancellation is ok, touch panel is not crisp and does not work well. I had to always skip songs or adjust volume directly on my phone. These are ok headphones but not worth $500.",3,1,2020-9-29,0,0,0
"Let me make it very simple n short for people who think it can block human voices or in a way make u deaf or something... well no it does not it will only reduce the noises low n mid frequency rumbling noises ...  since these are the best anc in the industry so am believing there is no such thing the market that can block human voices or completely block u out of any outer noises ... u might hear a lot of much going around u... sadly i bought believing it will .. anyway rest assured u get so soft padding , cushions, good sounding headphones. So make sure u r getting what u hope for , in my case I didn't n i spent a hell lot money for it .",3,1,2020-9-22,0,0,0

The noise cancelling on these headphones is so good that I didn't notice when people screamed and cars honked at me as I crossed the road. Anyway I got hit by a malfunctioning cement truck and permanently became one with the streets. Legends says that the headphones are still on my head in working condition. Would definitely buy again!,5,1,2020-9-2,0,1,0
"I bought these noise cancellation headphones after  knowing they where best in industry for anc. They are good for low frequencies but not at all good for high freq noises. Sound quality is so and so. Overally wouldn't recommend, theyre grossly overpriced for what they offer.After 4-5 hours of usage it starts to make crackling noise left headphone, this is a design issue with anc and I have replaced them and they still make noise in now in right headphone.",1,1,2020-9-26,0,0,0
"To be honest, i don't know if i got a faulty product or does it really work like that but my touch pad either hangs or becomes buggy once i activate speak to chat by tapping and holding the press with two fingers on the touch pad. It really feels bad to see your device malfunctioning when u have spent 30,000. I am curious to know if its fault in my product or its generally that way ??? Btw, sound quality, 360 audio and noise cancellation are good to make them a worthwhile possession!!",4,1,2020-9-23,0,0,0

I recently bought this product and I am so impressed with its performance. If you looking to buy this and comparing this with Bose NC 700 or Microsoft surface HP 2 then this is the right choice up front. This product is much more superior to those headphones plus it's cheaper in India compare to them.The only drawback I have faced is that I wear glasses so sometimes there grip is a bit too much for my ears otherwise no issue with sound quality whatsoever.,5,1,2020-10-1,0,0,1
"Great quality headphones for music, Zoom meetings, and phone calls. I just wish that they would retain the last setting for noise cancellation ""off"" since I prefer to use them without it.

"Noise cancelling is quite good and the headphones are comfortable.  I appreciate being able to toggle between cancelling noise and being able to listen to ambient sounds (talking) whenever I start to speak.  i.e. ""When is dinner ready?"" On the other hand, if I don't say anything, the world is pretty much dead to me.",5,1,2020-9-8,0,0,0
