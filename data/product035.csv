UPDATE 10/27/19Bottom line: 5 stars for customer service and 1 star for sound quality.,2,1,2019-10-19,1,4,0
"A bit of perspective to start things off. My experience with wireless earbuds started with Gear IconX 2018's. After those broke due to using them for working out too much (they're not rated IPX rated), I got my hands on a pair of TOZO T10's. A bit after getting the T10's, I started missing some features of my IconX's, so I jumped at the opportunity to get these.Sound Quality: 8/10",5,1,2019-10-5,1,3,1
"These headphones are really awesome. I use them regularly while working out in gym and they stay tugged in and never fall off. Since i sweat a lot, and these are waterproof i don’t worry about any issues. The Bluetooth pairing is super fast and easy. The sound quality is super, it has lot of bass, but doesn’t mean clarity has been compromised. The battery life is good.",5,1,2019-10-7,1,2,1
"There ear buds have a lot going for them but also one major flaw. Good sound quality..:not the warmest or richest tone but it gets the job done. The noise isolation can stand up to my loud subway commute which is huge.  But my biggest issue with them is the Bluetooth connection. It’s a huge design flaw. These buds connect to your phone even when the buds are still in their case. It’s hugely annoying. For example, I’m in the middle of listening to a conference call on my phone’s speaker, but the audio keeps dropping out...I’m stumped until I realize that the sound was going to the headphones, which were in their case in my backpack! Then there’s your car Bluetooth. These buds keeps stealing your car audio—not exactly something you want to deal with while driving. It’s a huge issue and it makes no sense.These may look like AirPods but they lack the intelligence and functionality. I had to return them.",3,1,2019-11-2,1,3,0
"I love the sound quality and loud sound volume of these earbutsThese earbuds fit great on my ear and aren't too heavy at all, they are very light.",1,1,2019-11-29,1,3,0
"These headphones are small and perfect for people that have smaller ears. The sound quality is awesome, the bass is just right and doesn’t drown out the music, even at the highest volume. The charging case is slim and can easily be slipped into your pocket. The headphones are magnetically held securely in the charging case and even the lid is magnetically held shut. The only downside I could find with these headphones was that the highest volume setting was not too loud, but it’s still loud enough to drown out all the outside noise. Overall a good quality product at a decent price.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,2,1
"Excellent choice.Apple Pods simply won’t stay in my ears while exercising, so I decided to give these a try.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,6,1
"I have the TOZO T10, it is one of the best Bluetooth earbuds on the market. This TOZO T6 is even better! The case is smaller than T10's case, it is very well built with quality material. Wireless charging is a great feature although I have not tested it yet. The earbuds are very easy to pair with iPhone and iPad. The sound quality is great. The earbuds are very well built. The touch control works great! Highly recommended!After using it for few weeks, I notice few issues with the product. The main issue is the touch buttons are too sensitives. My ears and fingers accidentally touched the buttons many times, which stopped or forward the song. I had to be very careful not to touch to buttons when I put on the earbuds. I preferred the TOZO 10 mechanics buttons.",4,1,2019-9-19,1,3,1
"These earbuds worked well for a couple of months, then stopped working on my iPhone!  They pair and connect each time without a problem.  But the instant that you actually hit the Play button on Spotify, SiriusXM, or any other app, the connection instantly drops and all you hear is soft static.  I found a posting on Facebook saying you need to update the firmware because some iOS update broke things.  But when I go to Tozo's website, it says their firmware update requires an ANDROID device!  It seems that there's no way to update the firmware on these earbuds using an iOS device or even a PC!  That's unacceptable since I don't have an Android device.  Really ticked off about this.  I guess I have to throw these in the garbage or sell them to someone with an Android device.  That sucks.",1,1,2019-10-22,1,7,0
"The sound quality is pretty good. Battery life is enough to enjoy your playlist for a long workout. My only problem with this product is that the earbuds are so sensitive. A little movement or touch by your fingers or clothing can paused, reverse and fast forward your playlist. It's annoying when you're just trying to adjust the earbuds or even wipe your sweat and your music changes or stops.",1,1,2019-12-14,1,3,0
These headphones are incredible! I purchased them due to me recently piercing my ears. I own a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones (the big ones). Well after sweating and wearing them for more than 30 minutes my piercings would be throbbing. I decided to get headphones that wouldn’t cover my whole ear (until my ears heal) that would not cost me an arm and a leg. I browsed Amazon and Came across these. Well I read the reviews and decided to go ahead and purchase them.Well let me tell you I am not disappointed! I purchased the rose gold and they are super cute. The noise quality is great and the rechargeable case is even better. They are such good quality headphones I cannot believe I paid less than $50 for them. I do intense cardio which leads to me being drenched in sweat. I am so glad these are waterproof!! I am really happy with this purchase I get compliments on them all the time and they were worth every penny I spent. The case is so little and cute I can carry in my purse like a pack of gum.,5,1,2020-1-13,1,5,1
"I just got these today and I am already in love with them. The box they come in is so sleek and it wasn't hard to open at all. In the box I got the guide, warranty, charging cable, case, buds, and a serious assortment of pad sizes. I replaced the XS size with the default ones they come with so they aren't pictured. Honestly I was worried about these things falling out since my ears are pretty small but I haven't had a single issue! The guide tells you correct way to wear them which is kinda funny but extremely helpful; make sure to ""twist"" them in and they'll fit so comfortably you can barely feel them! I had no issues pairing mine. The guide warns you that if you touch the control panel before pairing it may interrupt the pairing process, but I did that accidentally and still had no problems. Mine paired flawlessly on the first try. The guide gives you instructions on how to troubleshoot if pairing doesn't work which is really handy. I got the pink so that I would always know which buds/case were mine (since almost all others are exclusively black or white) and the pink is super pretty. The sound quality was great too; the bass is solid and the sound was so powerful I actually had to turn the volume down from my normal earbud setting. The touch pad of the buds takes a little getting used to but it's pretty intuitive, 2 taps on left bud is play previous song and 2 taps on right bud is play next song. 1 tap on either is stop/play current song. You can also hold left bud to lower volume and hold right bud to raise volume. The buds snap to the case as if there's a magnet in there so you don't have to worry about them falling out or moving around when the cap is closed. There's lights on the side of the case that shows you how much charge the case has. The one ""flaw"" I would say these buds have is that the case doesn't stand on its own but that honestly doesn't really bother me. Overall I'm extremely satisfied with these and so glad I ordered! Thank you!!",5,1,2020-3-21,1,9,1
The TOZO T6 improves on the T10 in several ways.The ear buds themselves are slightly smaller and are more comfortable in the ear.,5,1,2019-9-18,1,6,0
"I had the T10, and this T6 was offered as a free gift from Tozo for an honest review.First impression, by comparing the T6 to the T10, they look the same, but the T6 is a little smaller by comparing with the size. Maybe that's why when I put the T6 on, I feel a little more comfortable then the T10 and more secure on my ears. However, they don't come with foam ear tips, and the size of those ""gel"" ear tips aren't the perfect size for my ear canal. So I replaced them right away.",4,1,2019-9-26,1,5,1
These do not have a built in mic as advertised; they are using the phone's microphone. You can test this by simply walking further away from your phone. This seems to be a common theme across similar products on Amazon.,1,1,2020-1-18,1,5,0
First impression is that the headphones and charging case appear to be very nice quality. The features and voice commands are very nice.  The audio quality is fantastic. I love that the case can be charged with the same TOZO wireless charging pad that I use to charge my phone. Would buy again.,5,1,2019-10-3,1,2,1
I used these at work all day with several calls-excellent sound quality and then went for a 2.5 mile jog. They pair immediately and work well with one or both in. They are so comfortable and I didn’t have to readjust them even once on my run. Wish I could say the same about my shoelaces! I will never go back to corded ear buds again.,5,1,2020-3-4,1,7,1
I absolutely love these earbuds!! I have tried about 6 different brands and styles of earbuds but these are the best I have found. They also come with an assortment of different size tips for your ears so you can find that perfect fit. To my surprise they even have great bass!,5,1,2019-10-4,1,2,1
"These headphones are literally fantastic. I am a professional musician by trade and these have incredibly clear sound quality, really high end parts put into this product.The connection is fast and easy, it charges while in the case which is a great feature but better than all these features I love the ability to wear them in the shower and jam to tunes while they get soaked and survive it like a champ. Really high end headphones for a amazingly good price. I would recommend these to anyone looking for Bluetooth headsets similar to those made by Apple but for a far less price and also BETTER bass response!!",5,1,2019-9-27,1,1,1
"Who ever said theae are good sound quality and lots of bass hasnt heard the sabbat e12, jlab or jabar 65t and 75t... Only good part was the ear tips their premium silicone. Sound quality is a C, bass is D- im not a bass fanatic but like it punchy. Download an equalizer which made it dts 3d sound quality and still not good. Also volume dosent get high. Worst part is if u tap it accidentally u pause the song, u try to double tap it for next track, siri pops up.... Not happy the touch part on the ear buds is way to sensitive",2,1,2019-11-15,1,1,0
So I can't comment or review based off of anything regarding the sound or the noise cancellation because these wouldnt even go in my ears for me to hear anything at all. I put them in and they literally just fell out repeatedly I thought I was doing something wrong or putting them in wrong because again They were flying back out of my ears and I didn't see any reviews that mentioned this so just as soon as I can figure out how to return these I will be doing so,1,1,2019-11-18,1,4,0
"I have a couple of issues with these earbuds.1) the right earbud stopped working after my first long run. Granted I was sweating a lot but these earbuds were advertised as ""waterproof"".",1,1,2019-10-30,1,4,0
"Overall best earphones I’ve tried.  Case is nice & compact with rounded corners for easy carry in any pants or jacket pocket.  Doubles as a charger so no worries about battery life.  Sound quality is outstanding with phone in flat EQ mode.  Quality level makes you want to listen to music on it.  Phone calls work.  Not always the best sound on phone, but people can usually hear me well enough to make usable, which isn’t the case for many earphones.  No active noise cancelling, but good isolation despite that.  Good, comfortable fit with little risk of falling out.  Overall, a joy to have & great price for the quality.  UPDATE:  I've been using these to fall asleep.  Put one  in on the side away from the pillow (stick out to far to use on the pillow side).  Battery usually lasts all night at the  sound level I use.  If not, can readily switch to the other one.  Super easy connection since they connect automatically when you remove them from the case ((after the first time) & shut off when you put them back in the case, which automatically charges them when their put in.  No switches to work with.  Light turns blue to indicate that earphone is fully charged or red if still charging.  Case  has 4 white lights to indicate it's charge level & it recharges itself very fast when plugged in.  I can get a couple of recharges out of the case & have never had it run out of ability to recharge the earphones during the day.  Super happy with these!",5,1,2020-2-23,1,3,0
"This is the second time I reviewed this company's products. I'm sort of a earbud Junkie, and make a lot of purchases. About six months ago I purchased the older version of these headphones, and fell in love. I was looking on Amazon to see what other products this company had, and if there was any new versions. I was pleasantly surprised to see be upgraded version of headphones so I found a reason to order the newest set by giving my children my old set. I work in construction and listen to audio books all day long keep from going crazy , my job is incredibly boring. Because my job keeps me from home for such a longperiod. I only use one earbud at a time. I insert the first one around 3 a.m. and begin my stories, I swap it out around lunch and the second one last me until 4:30 in the afternoon when I get home. In the past with other brands I've had I'd have to swap out my earbuds about every 2 hours, not with these. The newest version that I'm reviewing is even better than the last, both in battery power, insound, an ability to connect to my phone. One problem that I've noticed I've had in the past with the charging boxes is that the magnets are almost never strong enough to keep the earbud from falling off while charging, this newest version has an incredibly strong making. It doesn't help that I have fat fingers then make it difficult for me to grasp small things. Hahaha, they did a great job we're including super strong magnets they will ensure that these earbuds keep charging for the next use. I threw my phone in one of my back pockets of my pants and this new version ensures you don't lose connection no matter which way you turn your head. They're incredibly loud and clear so that when you're in a noisy environment you can still hear what you're listening to. It took me a moment to get use to the fact that the buttons are touch activated rather than traditional buttons, but I quickly became acustomed to brushing the face of the earphone. Its nice as now when I set them in my ear I dont knock them out when trying to pause my audiobooks when people are trying to talk to me. In my last review of this company's products I said they have a customer for life, and I gladly say it again.",5,1,2019-10-2,1,8,1
"I have a young teenage son who wanted a pair of AirPods, as he was sick of headphones with wires. I was unwilling to get him something so expensive, so we compromised with these, as it won’t be as big of a deal if he loses them!I already own and love a pair of Tozo T-10s, but he wanted a pair with a much smaller case that will fit in his pocket at school. These fit the bill! They’re about 1/4 inch wider and just slightly taller than airpods. He’s super happy with the size.",5,1,2019-10-5,1,6,1
I have been using this earbuds for sometime now and these are perfect!. I was able to use this for long hours without getting ear pain. Sound quality is absolutely amazing and its very easy to carry in your pocket while traveling. I highly recommend this product.,5,1,2019-10-9,1,5,0
"So I have been looking for headphones similar to airpods in quality and feel for a while. I have tried many different headphones sold on Amazon, but either they are too big or they are too poor in sound quality.This is first headphone which has very good mic and provides very good sound quality even in noise environments, yes - I tried this at times square, absolutely no static and still other person can hear me. The sound quality is also fabulous. However what I love best about this one is its size, look and feel. Checkout the picture comparison with Airpods.",5,1,2019-9-24,1,2,1
I waited a month to submit a review because I wanted to form a a well informed opinion before posting.PROS:,1,1,2019-12-24,1,2,0
"The sound quality is what you get for the price. Just playing from pandora on low-mid volume and the buds couldn't play the sound without sounding staticky or distorted. To add to that, the got very hot to the touch after the first and last 10 minutes of use. Never tested the waterproof ability, and water wont make them sound any worse then they already are. Tried to get my money back or at least a new set that ""hopefully works"". But they wanted a 5 star review in order to get a new set. Honestly I think 5 star reviews are earned and not used with a new set of buds that cost $5 to make and sell for $60. Product reviews are made to be used to monitor the Customer Satisfaction Index of companies and there products, not be used as a scam on their customers. They're worth the price they pay to make them, because they ""don't work"".",1,1,2019-11-12,1,1,0
"The quality and look have exceeded my expectations. Not to mention all the added accessories that these Earbuds come with. I have not tested the ""waterproof"" aspect of them yet but I'm sure that won't disappoint either. Overall this is a great product and I would definitely recommend them to anyone who is looking for a great pair of earbuds at a decent price.",5,1,2020-3-5,1,3,1
I just received my ear buds and I’m very impressed with them! The packaging is really nice. I love all the sizes and shapes you get to fit your ear perfect! It’s super easy to pair and charge!,5,1,2020-2-24,1,4,1
"The earbuds are small and attractive compared to some large bulky ones I've seen. The sound quality is great. There are 2 issues that inhibit me from rating them above 3 stars. Once in the case they're difficult to remove. The earbuds are very slick and fit snugly in the case. My fingers slide off of them repeatedly when trying to remove them. I'm glad they're secure in the case but not to the point it's a chore to get them out. Lastly, they are difficult to position in your ear so they are secure. I have to push them in harder than I like in order to get a secure fit. Twisting them doesn't really change the fit because there's no shape to the earbuds to fit the outer portion of the ear. If they had a little rubber piece like some other brands that acts as a tensioner against the ear I think they'd fit much better, more securely. As for me, after an hour or so I have to switch to my backup earbuds because they start to hurt. It's not that I'm using the wrong rubber tip, it's that I have to push it in harder to feel they are secure.",3,1,2020-1-4,1,1,0
I'm coming from wired AKG buds that came stock with my Samsung S10. These are awesome for the gym! the battery life is impressive and the sound quality is top notch. I stream spotify through my phone and I find these to be absolutely perfect. The fit inside the ears is awesome...i've installed foam tips on mine for a better fit and they stay in no matter what the activity. The range is impressive to me. I can leave my phone on the machines and not have to worry about them falling out during sets. I haven't experienced any skipping whatsoever. Once the charging pod is dead I drop them on a charging mat and after a few hours i'm ready to go for another week.  So far this is my best gym purchase of 2019/2020.,5,1,2020-1-23,1,3,1
"I had the Sony WF-1000XMS, and after 2 Mos the battery life was less than half of advertised. Sound-wise, they were 10-15% better, BUT, is that worth 5 times the price? No. It's not. Plus the Sony's were constantly singing and pinging and telling me messages everytime the wind blew. These are harsh on the highs. Crisp to the point of crunchy depending on the track. If you live treble you'll be in heaven. Also if you like slightly tubby/bloated base you'll also be in heaven. Reggae dub must sound fantastic on these. I'll to play with them/the EQ a bit. I'll add an update in a little bit.Ok. I had to return this. The left bud would be dead after charging with flashing red which required re-pairing etc. After the 3rd time I’m returning them. Too bad! They were good, but a fatal flaw.",1,1,2020-2-9,1,1,0
"First, I must admit that I'm an audiophile so sound quality is my thing. I could go down the list of the crap I have but just take my word for it. I record and mix tracks for a living and I'm one of those people who can ""hear the difference"" when most others can't, so I'm kind of a perfectionist about my music. I'm not religious about brand names though, it just has to work and sound good.. Hence these babies. Having said that, I don't do Bluetooth unless I'm doing the gym thing because I think it sounds subpar. In the car I always do a headphone jack or USB-C out into my deck to get the best sound possible. So while I didn't expect much from these earbuds.. As soon as I put on the tozo T6's they blew my mind with how clean and clear they are. The sound stage is wide and open and awesomely clear for Bluetooth. Bass is clean and tight with a bit of a thump for people who need it. I wouldn't say they're overly bass heavy... More like average... But in a very good way.... Mids are clear without being honkey and the top end is clean and bright without being tinny. I listen to country... Mainstream pop...sometimes classic rock etc.And they sound great for my purposes.The only gripe that I can think of is one that reared its head right out of the gate for me, and that is that the Amps that run these little beauties are a bit weak. For a guy like me who likes to have some serious pump and volume to my music, they are lacking. I have a pair of jaybird X3's and while these sound better than those sonically... They just don't have the volume that I love and need when enjoying music... Which the X3s have. I had the same problem when I purchased the bose sound sport earbuds. They sounded amazing as well.. Better than the X3s also, but they didn't have the volume to push my music so I took those back.  Those Bose soundsports are on par with these Tozo T6s in terms of sound quality from what I can remember... But it's been a long time so I would have to hear them back to back to really say. But.. Just know that these tozo t6s are in the realm of bose quality. I know!",4,1,2019-12-28,1,8,1
"I ordered the T6 headphones because I loved my T10 's , the delivery was amazing and the quality of these headphones are outstanding!! The battery life is long and they are a great fit! I recommend to everyone",5,1,2019-9-19,1,1,1
These earbuds have a great fit. I can't wear the airpods because they hurt my ear after wearing them. These can be worn for hours and so far the battery will last that. These being IPX8 waterproof rated is great to make sure they aren't damaged in the sweat or rain. These were super easy to pair. I paired them with my computer and iPhone within a matter of seconds. Wireless charging is very convenient. I would recommend these especially for the price compared to other wireless earbuds.,5,1,2019-9-24,1,2,1
"Great wireless earbuds!! Super convenient case with wireless charging. Love these earbuds, great sound quality and sleek appearance.UPDATE: I had some issues with connectivity to my iPhone (although it was still working with my computer). After a few troubleshooting emails, they sent me a brand new replacement. Great customer service!!",5,1,2019-9-20,1,1,1
"The first set I bought was the pretty pink set and I loved them- however after three weeks they stopped charging. My original review reflected that. I was contacted my the seller a few months later and they offered to send me a replacement. I recieved it quickly and the new set (black) has not given me any issues. Which is why I changed my star rating from 1 to 3.The product itself is a solid product, and it was very generous of the seller to send a replacement. HOWEVER- in EVERY email that I received from the seller(LIKE ONE A DAY FOR A SOLID WEEK), it was overly stressed (ie GREEN HIGHLIGHTING) that they wanted me to change my online review BEFORE receiving a replacement, BEFORE knowing if their replacement would even work... it was very obvious that they REALLY only care about their reviews, and not about the quality or satisfaction of their customers. So as far as the product goes- 4 stars, easy. As long as you don't get a defective product, these work great! But their incredibly pushy and image-hungry customer service- 2 stars. If you want to make something right, by all means do. But don't offer to correct your problems and then demand recognition for it afterwards. I would not purchase from this company again.",3,1,2020-5-15,1,1,0
"I liked these ear buds more then my old ones because they have a firm grip and dont fall out easily while in your ears, the case comes in a beautiful slim case that has led indicators for how much battery life is left, and the audio quality is amazing I highly recommend.",5,1,2019-9-20,1,1,1
So I bought these on Sept 19th and have been using them almost every day since. They are extremely comfortable and fit my ear very well.  The battery lasts a very long time. I ended up accidentally leaving them out of the charger for over 12 hrs and they still have quite a lot of charge left on them.I also like the fact that you can pull either bud out and just that one ear bud turns on and links up to your phone (unlike the T10s which you have to take both out to turn them on and then but just the left bud back in to only use 1 bud).,4,1,2019-10-3,1,1,0
"Update: I can no longer suggest these.  They were great until right outside of the return window, when suddenly the right side stoped working completely.  It gave no indication of turning on, charging or anything else.  It happened while in use, is suddenly stopped.  I attempted multiple times to get in touch with the manufacturer since it claims there is a 1 year warranty, and I registered it the day I bought it.  But I never received any replies.  It's too bad because it may have been a fluke, and I may have still been satisfied with the purchase, but now they get a bad review because the warranty was not honored.I listen to a lot of podcasts and news.  I also listen to music as well.  These are great because I generally only have one ear in at a time anyway, so I can always have one charging while the other is in my ear so I never run out of battery, or for a more emersive experience, I can throw both in.  They are easy to set up and use.  Great quality, especially for the price.",1,1,2020-2-27,1,1,0
"I own both T6 and T10 models from TOZO. T10 was a huge success on amazon based on the reviews and after several months of use I totally agree with the near 5 star score. Although T6 has a lower model #, it is actually an upgrade to the T10 model. Both the ear pieces and the charging cases are smaller than T10, making them even easier to fit in pockets and lighter in ears. Sound quality is as good as T10. Connection was easy and stable. The biggest upgrade was the touch control which is much easier and comfortable than the click control in T10. I think the only missing feature, compared with the higher end earbuds, is the auto-stop functionality when a piece is taken out from the ear. However, for the bang for the buck, nothing can beat these pair",5,1,2019-9-20,1,1,1
"Purchased in Jan 2020.  Originally I thought the earbuds were OK, nothing spectacular, but not horrible either.  I struggled with getting the earbuds in and out of the case (my fingers are blocked by case cover and if they were wet at all, I couldn't grip the earbuds to break the magnetic bond) and with bumping the earbuds and having the tracks start and stop.  The second item is something that shouldn't be surprising with the touch control availabilty.In teh box there was a sign up to get a free item, I signed up for a free case...it never came.  So why the 1 star, for nearly 2 weeks I was bombarded with emails from them offering me things to change my review.  Considering they never sent me the case, I didn't trust them.  When I responded no interest to changing review, the emails kept coming but in greater frequency.  So they got what they wanted, I changed my rating...just not t he direction they were hoping.",1,1,2020-8-22,1,1,0
"Did you know that in 2 years your AirPods will only last 2-15 minutes each and apple will charge you $75 per side to ""repair"" them?  Those things are manufactured with superglue, and the unserviceable lithium ion batteries has a limited shelf life no matter how much you use them.Enter the T6.",4,1,2020-3-13,1,8,0
"First I liked the new case size better - it's flatter and fits nicer in pockets - prior models had the case just a little bit too big for my taste but this form factor is great. Like the previous model, they work great, easy to sync with the phone and this T6 version has better sound in my opinion. I listened to different kind of music (classical/jazz) and the sound quality felt great. They fit nice in the ear and the trick is to rotate them in the ear canal - I love the waterproof feature - now if I go in the shower or around water I don't need to worry and if I want to continue to listen to podcast or music - I can just do it. I like the wireless charging also and tested the wire but use all wireless chargers. Since the earbuds are small their battery life is not the greatest but last a while and you can recharge them in their case very quickly.  Since I got two of them T10 and T6), I can always flip flop between them if I need them for a longer trip like oversea flight. For the drive to/from work they always work nice and the battery lasts long enough.",5,1,2019-9-21,1,1,0
"After researching and reading dozens of review and answered questions on various brands for bluetooth earbuds, I finally decided to go with the TOZO T6 True Wireless Stereo Headphones which falls under 50$ budget.The main point which kept me dragging towards the TOZO T6 was its battery life. Of the available bluetooth earbuds in the market, TOZO T6 breaks the limit by providing around 5 - 6 hrs of battery life when used nonstop (Around 60 - 70% of volume). Either its working out in Gym or biking this earbuds provided great sound quality. As most people complimented on the sound quality, I felt the sound quality is amazing with powerful bass and stereo like sound.",5,1,2019-9-23,1,1,1
"Sound quality very poor compared to the earpods that came with the iphone. Sound quality comparable to nine dollar Bluetooth earbuds I already had. All features seem to work fine, but what good is that if THE MUSIC IS REPRODUCED POORLY. Sent this baby back right away. Don’t understand all the glowing reviews at all and yes I did have them placed in my ear properly I listened to several different kinds of music and sound reproduction poor on all.",1,1,2019-10-24,1,9,0
"Update: 4/7/2020I was contacted by the company because they read my original review where I was obviously unsatisfied with my purchase of these earbuds. They reached out and offered to send me a new set, stating that the issues I was am having should not be happening. I am pleasantly surprised that this happened. It shows that they really care about the product and experience that people are having. I will update again when I receive the new earbuds set.",4,1,2020-2-29,1,8,0
"I gave these a try, but overall, I'm not happy with them. The battery life is decent and they will last around 4 hours which is the only positive thing I can really say about them. Unfortunately, the sound quality isn't very good at all and they seem underpowered. These have ZERO bass. One issue I noticed right away was the voice that plays when adjusting volume, skipping, or pressing play/pause is all choppy, and I suspect that the hardware in these is very low quality. I also find them to be quite uncomfortable and I could never wear these while being active. They tend to seal into my ear canal so well that it feels like a mini toilet plunger in each ear as the weight of the unit pushes/pulls on them.After about 2 months, the device has started to randomly connect to my phone while the buds are in the case. It has been really annoying because any notification sounds play in the headphones and I'll miss important calls/messages. When I go to use the buds, they are completely drained along with the case itself. I already want something else that works better. I bought a USB dongle instead and went back to my old corded buds.",1,1,2020-2-27,1,8,0
"The product connected only after some time but the phone connectivity was very bad, others could hear be bad. Noise cancellation doesn't seem to work fine. Return policy is difficult, 30 days but you have to print the label yourself, so if you are a traveler, difficult. I missed my timeline and amazon doesn't seem to give you an easy way to just contact the seller. I really dont understand why as a prime member you still have to print individual labels.",1,1,2020-2-15,1,2,0
"These are awesome! The sound quality is just as good as pricier headphones. The bass is amazing! One thing I don't think the description mentions is that it supports your choice of voice assistant. (Google, Alexa, ect.) I was pleasantly surprised. They automatically connect when you take them out of the case, and disconnect when you put them away. The case charges quickly, even on my crappy wireless charger. One feature that was very important to me is that you can use one ear bud at a time. If/when you decide to pop in the other one, a pleasant voice says ""primary"" in the first ear and ""secondary"" in the second, so you know its connected. The only drawback when using one ear bud is skipping songs. The left ear bud skips backwards, and the right skips forward, so if you only have the left ear bud in, you can only skip backwards and vice versa. Not a big deal, but may be bothersome to some people. The touch control is very responsive and easy to remember. 1 touch to pause/ play. Double press right or left to skip forward or backwards. One press to answer calls, and 3 X to access your voice assistant. It's that easy! They feel very secure in your ear, I have never had them fall out, but they make SURE they will fit anyone perfectly. The come with 6, yes SIX different earpieces of different styles and sizes, so you're sure to find one that fits your ear perfectly. If you're on the fence, go ahead and get these. You will not be disappointed, and for only $50... you really can't go wrong. These have the same sound quality as headphones 3X as much!",5,1,2020-2-29,1,4,0
I had the T10 they are wonderful.  I still have the T10 they are my backups. I love the product and the price is very reasonable.,5,1,2019-10-1,1,2,0
So glad I bought these instead of wasting money on airpods. Great sound quality for the price cant beat it. Plus the touch activation comes in handy to lower volume and pause the music and more,5,1,2020-2-26,1,6,1
"I've been using these earbuds daily for a couple of months now, and I absolutely love them. I have several pairs of wireless ones, but I keep gravitating to these.The sound quality is really great. Excellent bass! I can wear them comfortably for hours.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,4,0
"To start, I really enjoyed these earphones while they lasted. Great sound, loved the microphone and how accessible there were. Too bad they only lasted a month before the right earbud decided to stop working. Going to be upgrading to a higher quality version next time.Update: so I ordered another pair of these headphones because I thought to myself, maybe I just got a defect, and because I like these headphones so much I'm willing to give it another try. Turns out, the new pair of headphones that I got has the SAME ISSUE. After one week of use, the right earbud has continued once again to stop working. I'm going to once again, return these headphones and never purchase anything from this company again the quality is horrible.",3,1,2019-12-31,1,2,0
Pros: ✔️ battery life 5 1/2 hours (until let you know that the battery is low)✔️ You can switch not necessary use both at the same time. (So that would make your battery time longer).,1,1,2020-1-30,1,2,0
"The sound was great and I loved the automatic connection and being able to seamlessly switch from one earbud to the other.  I loved the touch controls, wireless charging and multi-charge case.  However, I am using this device for two-way communication (phone calls/zoom meetings) and the person on the other end hears a clicking sound when I speak.  I had a colleague record me so I was able to hear it myself.  I exchanged the first pair thinking it was just poor construction, but the second pair had the same problem.  I'm really disappointed because I did like the small size, charging case and sound quality.  But I need to use these for two-way communication, so these just won't do.**Updated stars because the product is great in all areas but the one and the company reached out and said I may have received a defective product.  I may try the T10 to see if it's better for two-way.",4,1,2020-5-12,1,5,0
"Value for price is crazy with all the $200+ options out there. I tried the Jabra 65s and found the fit clunky (I have small ears) and sound just ok. The Tozos surprised me from the moment I opened them. The total reviews seem suspicious (40000+ for the T10s?) but all are positive and now I know why. Sound quality is exceptional for the price, pairing is seamless, light touch controls blow Jabra out of the water. If you want true noise canceling these aren't it, but for $50 who cares! They block out enough noise for a great sound experience. I use them for taking work calls and the mic is solid. Truly surprised how happy I am with these. Shows how overpriced Apple, Jabra and Samsung buds are just going on brand.",5,1,2020-3-7,1,3,0
"I don’t get excited about electronics much, but this product is amazing!!! The noise cancelation is beyond great, music/bass sounds amazing, they don’t fall off... and let’s be honest their way less then AirPods lol :)",5,1,2020-1-9,1,5,0
"I am very happy with these headphones.- The sound quality is excellent.  It does not quite measure up to the Sony over-ear headphones that I use when not moving around but for earbuds, the sound quality is impressive.",5,1,2020-4-29,1,8,0
"Looking for a cheap alternative to Airpods, bought these based on numerous positive reviews.  Worked great for about 2 weeks, then the left earbud started cutting in and out during my runs.  Always and only during exercise.  I contacted the company and the response was that this was a known issue with iOS, and the solution is to download an app onto an Android device and update the firmware in the earbuds.  I don't have an Android device!If you have an Android device you might want to take a chance on these.  When they worked, the comfort, sound quality and noise isolation were good for the price.  I was very happy for like two weeks.  I have since returned these and shelled out for Airpods, and those are WAY better.  As they should be, given the price.",1,1,2020-5-18,1,8,0
"Full Disclosure  -  I purchased the older T10 model several months ago and was recently sent a pair of this new T6 model, in exchange for an unbiased review.Overall, I am impressed with the improvements that have been incorporated into the newer T6 model wireless earbuds and find that I prefer them over my older T10 model, in most cases.",4,1,2019-10-14,1,7,0
"These headphones are pretty. The earphones are comfortable for short term use. However if you have an iPhone they will say ""link loss"" repeatedly and lose connection to the phone. The only way you can update software on these is if you have an Android mobile device. There is NO other way to update these. Technical support for these is a joke as well. If you have an Android I would say test these out otherwise its a waste of time and money.Update",1,1,2020-5-11,1,8,0
I ordered for work and the noise cancellation works very well as I work close to machines in a small enclosed area.I reviewed the ratings of other ear buds before I chose to purchase the TOZO T6.They paired to my phone easily as I removed from charger case.The case is small and fits well into my pocket! The sound is very good as well for a reasonable price!,5,1,2020-1-22,1,3,1
"Update 3.26.20: For the T6 they really need to make the earbuds have a more tactile material rather than a slippery smooth material it's too difficult to pickup and remove from the charging case. I don't know that I would buy this again because of this major issue.Update 3.21.20:  I've already dropped these earbuds due to being very slippery on tile floors I don't know how much abuse these can take but I'm pretty sure slippery earbuds are not going to last very long from the amount of slipping out of your fingers and crashing to the floor at home, airports, restaurants, etc.",3,1,2020-3-18,1,5,0
After using these earbuds for a little while I found that they are pretty handy to have as I don't have a cord connected to me 24/7. There are a few things to note with this product though that I feel can really turn away some people.The Pros:,3,1,2020-1-21,1,5,0
"The touch control is frustrating. It seems to be too sensitive when I don't need it to be. I don't know how many time it pause the music or go forward/backward while I was trying to adjust the earbuds or scratch my ear or pull back my hair. Also, it said to TWICE to forward/backwards. But lot of time when I tap twice, it started Google Assistance on my phone. Maybe I am just not use to the touch control.On a side note, I don't know whether it's my ear shape or the LEFT and RIGHT label on the earbuds was labeled incorrectly. Because the one label ""L"" actually fits my right ear and the one label ""R"" fits my left ear. If I wear it according to the label, not only they don't fit but actually hurt my ears",3,1,2019-11-8,1,2,0
"This is an early impression of the Tozo T6s and im going to do comparisons to the older T10s as those have been my daily earbuds for half a year. I am a intense runner who sweats alot and ive broken many earbuds due to that and these tozo earbuds are one of the two brands ive had that haved lasted and the T10s being my favorite. Once i heard a new model was coming out I ordered shortly after and was initially impressed with overall size decrease, what sounds like slightly better quality, and touch controls on the device for some extra control (something the T10s lacked).Initially setting these up was a breeze. They connected immediatly. My T10s sometimes take a half a minute to connect but these were instant. Also to note, theres no annoying beeps if you only wanted to use one earbud instead of both ( comes in handy if you use them at work or school for background noise). Using them with my phone for music while laying in bed was great, no disconnects, and default ear pieces fit really well for me so i didnt fear of them falling out and getting lost.",4,1,2019-10-24,1,1,0
"I got these headphones to go to the gym and walk in between classes. But for the love of god they Don’t stay in my ears!! And no matter how far I put them in they end up still falling off when I’m running. These headphones are also really sensitive and if u just tap/ put back in ur ear one of them, they start over the song, skip the song, pause or turn off the song. Very annoying to have to keep going back to my phone to play my music just because they didn’t fit in my ear. Yes I will return but I don’t recommend any petite women with these.",1,1,2020-2-17,1,8,0
"Earbuds are very comfortable, secure, and have decent sound quality. No issues with pairing. Case is nice and compact. A bit hard to read the R and L on each earbud, but not a big deal - just add a dab of touch-up paint to one or the other of your choosing and you'll never have to squint again. I LOVE having no cords to deal with and the earbuds fit comfortably under my ski helmet and motorcycle helmet, although it may take a couple of tries to get the helmet on without pulling out an earbud. Touch control on the earbud is very sensitive, which is both good and bad. Accidental taps when adjusting the fit can sometimes be a bit annoying. The biggest problem with these earbuds is that they're utterly useless as far as making phone calls. The microphone simply does not pick up your voice, even if you speak at an unusually loud volume. Anything the other party CAN hear has horrible sound quality. I still like these earbuds due to their comfort, convenience, and freedom from cords, but if I get a call, I immediately turn off my phone's Bluetooth in order to answer the call using the phone itself, not via the earbuds.",3,1,2019-12-1,1,5,0

"I really really like these wireless earbuds, I was kind of skeptical about buying these and how the quality of these were going to be, but they’re actually really nice, sound quality is really good, battery life is really great and wirelessly charging the case is super fast.

Update: Today 3/31/2020I received the T6 replacements. I was able to connect them to my iPhone XR without any issues. These sound much louder and the bass response is much better and clearer. The kids and highs are neutral and clear as well. Tozo customer service was correct about my previous set malfunctioning. I’m glad that these work as expected since they are the most comfortable wireless/Bluetooth earphones I’ve had. You can’t go wrong buying the T6. Their customer service is one of the best I’ve had the pleasure to deal with.,5,1,2020-3-1,1,4,0
"These are the first earbuds I’ve used.  I’ve used other wired and wireless over-the-ear, and sport-style in ear forward facing speaker, headphones.  These are the worst sounding I’ve ever heard.  Now I have a hard time getting earbuds far enough in my ear, and maybe this affected the sound quality, but I used the smallest cushions they included.  The music was clear but sounded tinny and had no fullness.  Sounded like a handheld transistor radio from the 60’s.  Bass was totally lacking.  Easy to pair and seemed to be well made, but with sound this bad they are being returned.",2,1,2019-12-4,1,6,0
"The summary:The sound quality and noise cancellation is great.  The hinge on the case is easy to break.  When the case is in your pocket, and especially when it is upside down, the buds tend to disconnect from the charging prongs and attach to your phone. when you pick up a call, your phone audio isn't working until you figure it out and turn off bluetooth.  Last shady thing about the rating is it is artificially inflated.  Within a week of purchasing it, you get an email stating that if you write a very good review, and then send a copy of it to them, which they verify, they will send you a free wireless charging unit.  I didn't sell myself.",3,1,2020-6-5,1,4,1
"Update 7/28/20: I use these approximately 8 hrs per day, between two pair, to provide telehealth.  I'd give 4 stars if I hadn't had to file two warranty claims within 6 months.BATTERY LIFE:  The buds last at most 4 hrs per charge.",3,1,2019-12-11,1,5,0
*I received the T6 from TOZO for an honest review.*I have no comparison between other models of truly wireless earbuds but I do use the Shure SE435 with the bluetooth converter. My thoughts are after a week of use.,4,1,2019-10-29,1,5,0
"These require a firmware update to properly pair with iphones with the latest ios update.  Refer to the Tozo website support page for details.  Unfortunately, the update process requires an Android phone.  Furthermore, the update app (provided only on their website) is not available on the official google play store for android, so it must be downloaded and installed to your android phone in an atypical manner (file manager and granting permissions).  If you don't have an android phone, there is no way to update the firmware.  No comment yet on the audio quality or fit of the earbuds.

I purchased these to wear at the gym and at work. I have a cleaning business so I am constantly moving. They really worked well. I have small ears and have a hard time finding anything that will fit not hurt or fall out. These worked. I actually left them in my pocket the first time I used them and I washed them. I figured they were gone. But to my surprise they worked and are still working two months later. Wow. The touch controls are a little quirky to get the hang of I had to refer to the manual but I got use to it. So I am impressed with this product it serves my needs and I wear them 4 to 5 days a week for 4 to 6 hours at a time. They were also easy to pare with my phone (Samsung Galaxy s9+). So overall a nice product I recommend them.,5,1,2020-2-19,1,4,0
"I’m going be completely honest with you all here as I am with the majority of products that I purchase that are worthy of writing a review on, you feel me?  Some are so bad and I’m so pissed I don’t leave a review.  Okay, here it is.  I have a pair of JVC ear pods that I paid $100.00 for not too long ago and they do not sound better than these.  Unbelievable sound, especially that damn bass, and when you have them equalized to your liking it is all cream.  You know what they say about CREAM?  Besides “Cash Ruling Everything Around Me” it also as a it has unique quality.  It’s Cream.Sugar falls to the bottom and dissolves, but the cream always rises to the top?  These are CREAM family.  I am a straight up House Music and Free Style fiend.  It is imperative that I have great sound and at least somewhat of a good battery life.  The battery life on the TOZO’s puts my JVC’s and the three other pair that I have to shame.  I said to myself “ Dude, you used these bad boys all day long.  You watched YouTube, listened to Spotify, and watched movies and they’re still going strong.",5,1,2020-5-17,1,2,0
"Got two of these one as a gift and the other for myself. The mic on the ear buds chip in and out. I felt so bad about gifting these. They disconnect occasionally while in use. I thought it was just the one I had but both were doing it. The music volume is below average compared to $5 ear phones at gas station. On a call the person on the other end, will hear your background clearly and not you.The design I like and the color it came in. The battery life is good. The pairing is simple also the feature to turn it of while it in your ear. The difference size bud tips came in handy.",1,1,2020-3-25,1,4,0
"Edit: customer service is on point. The TOZO company reached out to me and asked how they could make it right, that I may have received a faulty pair and offered me a replacement or a refund. Top notch customer service. Was not expecting that. That alone deserves 5 stars.Sound quality is ok. Crackles a bit at their loudest and they honestly don't go loud enough for me. I don't blow my ears out with music either. It's just an unsatisfying level. I like heavy bass and they don't really do much for it. They don't really cancel noise out. Just muffle it. Very annoyed by the voice in my ear every time I skip a song or go back to a song. Don't like that at all. Haven't tested how well they hold up to a shower or heavy exercise yet but honestly I don't trust they'd survive. Worth half what I paid for them in my opinion. I'll update my review if needed when I've gotten more use out of them.",5,1,2020-5-19,1,3,0
"I must have been fooled by all the ""incredible"" and ""amazing"" reviews (all 30k of them?), because my experience was 100% opposite these claims. At first test, I noticed the sound quality was really quite poor (very tinny, extremely light on bass and mid range frequencies), but since I bought these as earbuds for jogging I wasn't expecting them to sound amazing. I waited to make a judgement until my first jog, at which point I experienced (within 15 minutes) the following: trouble pairing, frequent bluetooth dropouts despite the fact I was holding my phone, earbuds falling out of place, and the sound quality of a buzzing mosquito. Pocketed the TOZO's for the rest of my jog and promptly repacked and returned to Amazon. I don't enjoy writing harsh reviews, but I am a professional audio engineer by trade and these aren't worth even 10$ to me.UPDATE: 9/27",1,1,2020-8-29,1,2,0
"Tozo customer service seems very attentive in this initial phase of ownership.I'm adding a review a bit early due to the 1yr extended Warranty registration process, I would have preferred to go a month or so before reviewing to get a more in depth feel for all the nuances, therefor I won't go too deep, and I will follow-up in a few weeks of experience.",3,1,2020-2-23,1,2,0
"*Update: the company contacted me and and made everything right. I am still sad about the quality of the product I received. But the company is working hard to make happy customers. If their products were as great as their customer service, I’d be a customer for a long time. They took good care of me and perhaps not all of their earbuds are created equal. Maybe I just got a bad pair. Give them a try and if they don’t work, the company will take care of you.I don’t know if I just got a defective pair or what. But the sound quality for audio is awful! It crackles and hisses and I am not pleased with these at all. I was so excited after reading the rave reviews. But unfortunately paid reviews aren’t always honest.",2,1,2020-9-17,1,2,0
"The Tozo 6 earbuds are stand outs in a very competitive field of attractively priced true wireless earbuds. They are small, very comfortable, pair very easily, have excellent connectivity and clarity, well designed touch controls, and provide solid bass in a well balanced sound stage. The case is really sturdy and extraordinarily compact too! The onboard microphones (one in each earbud) provide very good sound quality during phone conversations. Callers reported that I came through loud and clear on their end. The fact that there is a mic in each earbud means you can use one or the other (or both) for calls...whatever works best for you, on the job or at play.These earbuds do not have electronic noise cancellation or ambient ”pass through”.  They do provide excellent sound isolation when used with the right size tips for your ear canals (they come with a range of sizes to choose from). Both the earbuds and the case are IPX8 waterproof rated, which is the best I’ve seen from any brand of earbuds out there. Theoretically you could wear these swimming or in the shower with no problems. I have not put this level of waterproofness to the test (and don't intend to ever do it on purpose) but it does ease concern over a bit of sweat, raindrops or an accidental splash during a water balloon fight 😉.",4,1,2020-1-6,1,2,1
I'm actually pleasantly surprised with these earbuds! The sound quality is very close to being perfect. The noise cancellation is great and adds to the sound quality because you dont hear any outside noise. I love the touch feature because it adds to the hands free element and I don't have to worry about pulling my phone out to adjust the volume or to skip a song. The ear caps fit comfortably in my ear and it comes with different sizes to accommodate to your preference. The battery life is another thing I'm happy with. I was given earbuds as a gift from a friend and the battery life on those were only 2 hours. These last all day of me using them. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase. I was really going back and forth with either getting these or airpods. I didnt want to spend $50 just for them not to be good and have to spend more money to get better ones. I'm glad I made the choice to spend the $50 on these instead of the $150 on airpods. These are just as good if not better! I'm super happy!!*edit* after having used these for a few days now I do have a suggestion to make the product better. The top of the case should be able to open further back like the airpods because it is a little hard and annoying to take the earbuds out with very limited space. I would also suggest that TOZO should make and sell case covers. The size of the earbud case is bigger than the airpods so it's impossible to find a case that would fit the TOZO brand earbuds.,5,1,2020-2-11,1,2,0
I compared these against AirPods and AirPods Pro which I also own.- Very nice build quality and materials overall.,4,1,2019-11-2,1,4,0
I liked them in the beginning but then I tried to eat and they kept falling out or just doing things . I’d rather wear the headphones and have the wires than these but I’d choose these than the air pods if that makes sense. They’re good if you’re into asmr but not working out. They have that sucking effect in your ear so when you take them out it takes a while for your ears to feel normal again. In the box they have different rubber sizes for your ears so I switched to every single size and it didn’t matter it still felt that way and still fell out after a while. I’m going back to headphone use though. I’d return them if I could and I do have warranty but I don’t know if I can.,1,1,2020-5-24,1,3,0

"So far I am enjoying these earbuds.  The sound is quite good but not quite as good as my wired ones.  There is not as much separation of various instruments in music but otherwise sounds quite good.  Of course the battery life could be longer but so far that has not been a problem.  I would definitely recommend these but I have only had them for a couple of weeks.Update:  It is now June 9 and one of the earbuds no longer keeps a long charge.  It now only lasts about 2 hours whereas the other one still works well.  However, what good is just one earbud.  With all the many earbuds out there don't buy this one.",1,1,2020-4-13,1,4,0
"These worked really well ... until they didn't. While on a run last week, the left earbud abruptly announced it was going to shut itself off due to low power, even though the set seemed to be fully charged. I finished the run on one earbud, the right, which crapped out two blocks from home. I charged the case and the earbuds, and now only the left earbud will sync with my phone. The other one is clearly powered on, but the phone will not recognize it. I didn't buy stereo earbuds to wear only one at a time.I went to the website only to find out that apparently these earbuds don't play with the newest version of iOS unless you upgrade the firmware. When you look for instructions to get the firmware, you are directed to a poorly written PDF that says you can only upgrade the firmware ... by syncing to an Android device. Thanks for nothing, TOZO. I now have one earbud that works, one that doesn't, and no way to upgrade the firmware. The set worked really well for several months. I guess I'll find someone with an Android device and give them away. What a waste of money.",1,1,2020-6-13,1,3,0
"The sound quality on the product is great I have no issues with it whatsoever and the battery life is awesome. I work outside and will use these all day. I wear one until lunch and swap it out for the other one after lunch. It is not dead by that time, but I swap them at that time for convenience. I absolutely love the rose gold color. Most bluetooths are black or white and the availability of this color made my heart happy. The charging case for the ear pieces is slim and sleek and also holds a very good charge. I did have some issues with the fit of the product but came to a happy resolution with the seller.The seller’s customer service for this product was amazing. They went above and beyond anything I expected in order to make sure that I was happy with the outcome of my purchase.

"Great headphones but the reason for the low star rating is because the headphones loose their connection with my phone frequently.There is no reason; sometimes I’ll hit pause and when I hit play again the music comes from my phone not the headphones, then the headphones will say Link Lost.

"I purchased these to use primarily with my computer and secondly with my phone.  I use a USB headset for long hours and it has a tendency to irritate my head and ears after extended use so I though this would be a good solution.  First off none of the earbud cover thingies will fit my ears.  The buds wont fit snugly and will not stay in.  Second (and this is the primary reason for the low rating) the left bud has a volume level less than half of the right bud.  I tested them with multiple devices, swapped ears, even had my wife try.  Same thing.  I could find no settings or any way to fix this.  It is annoying because I sounds like all the sound is coming from the right ear and I have to turn up the volume which causes it to sound blow out.  Thirdly the sound is incredibly tiny sounding both from my phone and computer and the volume is just too low.  It does not sound anything like what other reviewers here are claiming (perhaps my expectations are too high...dunno) I am returning these and I am not sure if I even want another pair.",1,1,2020-2-27,1,5,0
"I really don't like writing negative reviews . However in this case I feel strongly about the product  voice my opinion. Admittedly, any kind of listening device is very subjective. The unit sounded ok for the brief time they were in my ears however they kept falling out when I was wet so how can I fairly evaluate the sound? What good is a waterproof Bud if it won't stay in when you get wet? Also the touch controls were overly sensitive. In the process of the excessive adjustments to keep them in my ears the music kept stopping and starting. Suggest the manufacturer give it another try. Not my cup of tea.",1,1,2020-3-9,1,4,0
"Hi Everybody,So a while ago I ordered these wireless earbuds back on January 3, 2020. Upon receiving them I was ecstatic. However, after using them for two days my right earbud stopped working. As a result, I drafted up a one-star negative review despite highlighting their potential positive features. With that being said, if you ever encounter an earbud that's stops working? Follow the instructions and reset them. Whereas, if both earbuds still don't work? Then reach out to Amazon Customer Service; so they can connect you to the Tozo Customer Service; to allow Tozo to remediate the problem.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,4,0
"Edit: I was very excited about the possibility that these might be, in fact, very good earbuds as you can read below in my initial review. I was terribly wrong. Regardless, of all the good things I wrote the actual fact is that the sound from them was terrible. I got different volume levels on 3 different Samsung devices and no matter how much I tinkered with auto & manual EQ settings i could get very little bass out of them and music therefore always sounded hollow. The one time I wore them to the gym I was a little irritated by the fact that I could not hear anything coming from the buds over the normal gym noise. Noise cancellation, passive or otherwise, nonexistent. Sound quality was never staticky, popping, or signal fading in or out BUT had no dynamic range without much base. Once again I feel like I was tricked by reviews and average rating. My hunt for a decent set of earbuds that don't disappoint continues.Below is my original review...",1,1,2020-6-16,1,2,1
"This is the first product review I have ever written, and I'm only writing it because I have been so dissatisfied with this product.  I have owned these headphones for four months.  The sound is pretty good.  But they will not stay in your ears if you are engaged in any kind of activity.  Certainly not running or biking, they even fall out just working out at the gym or actively working around the yard.  None of the ear bud covers worked to keep the pods secure in my ears.  And they operate based on a push button on the outside of the pod - if you press one side they turn off, if you press the other side the song skips back one or skips back to the start.  Which means when you try to push the pods more securely into your ears when they are slipping out (which occurs frequently), you can't do it without either shutting them off or skipping back a song.  I've given up, this was a complete waste of money.",1,1,2020-5-24,1,4,0

"Purchased these headphones for my wife. it is actually the 2nd set of tozo headphones purchased. I actually prefer the T6 over the T10 model.Sound is top notch along with the battery life. they fit well into the ear, inluded are different sizes for the bud to fit well. The reason i prefer this model over the T10 is the weight of the units. These are light weight and stay in the ear even with a lot of moving around. I found the T10's to fall out a bit easier and i believe it is all related to the weight of the units.",4,1,2019-11-29,1,4,1
"This is more than likely my first negative review on Amazon, at least according to my memory. These will also more than likely be the very first product that I return and refund. Appalling to say the least. I have had these for a couple days as of now and I have not used these earbuds. The connection issue with these is bad. Really really bad. Some lag and stuttering I expect but having my audio stop every 30 seconds is grating. Followed by the lag between the earbuds. These things do not work. I do not expect much but I at least expect these things to work. They fail to even do that. I am spending far more time than necessary in just getting these pieces of junk to work. They have one more day of my labor before I return these and go to a competitor for another set. This is my first pair of wireless earbuds and the experience so far has been poor to say the least. Extremely unimpressed, would not buy again let alone recommend this brand to others",1,1,2020-3-26,1,4,0
Works great!! Received Sealed!! Plus extra extra plus- I LOVE THE COLOOOR! I thought it would be doooo pink but its almost like a rose gold and its PERFECT!!Very Satisfied and never been satisfied from any of my online orders! Fits very well it doesnt fall off!

"If I could give these headphones negative stars I would. They are absolutely trash from sound quality, how they fit in your ears, to the battery life. These headphones aren't even worth 20$ if you ask me I've literally had 20$ headphones that are better then these. It's very frustrating because they do not fit in your ears properly so naturally you will push them back in when you feel them start to slip out, well even just tapping one of the headphones will either skip the current song, pause the song or make the volume continuously go up or down till you tap the headphone again. I hope this review can save someone some money because these have to be the worst pair of headphones I've ever had. Got so frustrated and annoyed with them I finally threw them in the trash today and decided to write a negative review ( first one of my life) in hopes I can save someone from making the terrible decision of wasting their hard earned money on these ridiculous headphones. You could probably go to your local gas station and find a better pair for under 20$",1,1,2020-4-9,1,4,0

"These earbuds easily get 5 stars for style, convenience, fit, easy to pair to multiple devices, bang for the buck, ... they are perfect on all fronts up to the audio quality. I am very much a sound guy, and I don't believe there will be a pair of ear buds out there, ever, that will match to my home audio or full headphone equipment.That being said, these buds are reasonably good in the audio quality spectrum. The sound is a bit narrow, individually highs and lows have a strong response. There's a bit of muddling going on with songs that have a busy, high dynamic range, but that is to be expected. I don't know that I would enjoy these for 8 hours at a shot at any considerable volume, but for a couple hours, for a movie, or a run, they're going to be great.  For sound quality overall I would give three stars (compared to my sennheiser and bose cans), and four stars when comparing them to other earbuds I've owned. Don't get me wrong, the sound quality is GOOD. And at the price point, wireless charging, they come in pink which is brilliant, it's a no brainer and I'm super pleased with my purchase",4,1,2020-1-23,1,4,0
"Update 07/15/2020:After 9 months, one of my earbuds stopped functioning, however I emailed Tozo support and inquired about the 1 year warranty. After trying a few troubleshooting tips they suggested, my earbud was still not functioning. After replying back to Tozo support, they said they would ship a replacement. Great support from Tozo!",5,1,2019-10-23,1,2,1
Worked great for 45 days. Now the right earbud won’t connect. I use these 3-4 times a week for about an hour each time at the gym. No water immersion or other forms of abuse. $65 wasted because the rerun window closed 15 days ago. Don’t waste your money.,1,1,2019-12-18,1,6,0
"With all the 5 star ratings I expected something pretty decent but was met with skullcandy $15 target headphone quality. The sound quality is slightly less than average and the noise cancellation is only for soft or background noise. I took these to the gym with me and while they were fine for weights and stayed in for the most part, running was really impacted and disrupted by them. They would not stay in place regardless of the ear size piece I tried and every time you try to adjust them you accidentally hit one of the touch commands sending your music all over the place. I can hear myself running and they do NOT get loud. All this would be fine if they were priced for what they are but the 5 star reviews boasting of superior quality and sound have me confused. I'm very in to music while working out and I've had headphones ranging from 10-200$. For my needs these did not meet my expectations and I will be returning.",2,1,2020-8-12,1,2,0
"First off, packaging is classy and a hint of things to come. Design of case is smooth, ergonomic, solid, sleek. Magnetic lid clasps tightly with precision. Buds exceed my expectations. Even response across the sound spectrum. Sound is excellent and equals the best I've owned. Bluetooth is fast and works as you'd like with stupid easy quick pairing. Very pleased. Outer surface of bud is touch-sensitive and ingenious but takes a little getting used to. Number of taps, length held, etc, all perform different functions and works flawlessly after you get used to it.  May be a bit complicated for tech-challenged folk used to seeing buttons you can read and click. Case has four cool looking LEDs showing charge state and progress. They recharge faster than any other I've owned...minutes after 5 1/2 straight hours of music. wow. Selecting the correct size earbud was a challenge but kit comes with six different sizes...I usually need large and with proper fit the bass finally kicked in. I just bought another pair.",5,1,2020-7-23,1,1,0
"These earbuds were great for a few months, but over time the volume got softer and softer until one side was almost inaudible. I tried to contact the seller, but the Amazon Chat Bot would not let me connect with them, it kept redirecting me to Amazon Support, who was useless. (The first agent offered me a refund, but apparently was vetoed by her supervisor who then wasted 30 more minutes of my day on useless back and forth that did not solve my issue.)After 22 years as an Amazon customer (yes, really), you would THINK they would at least offer to reach out to the seller on my behalf... but nope.",1,1,2020-9-27,1,2,1

"Disclaimer: Since I had purchased and reviewed the Tozo T10s, Tozo offered to send me the T6s for free to review. This review is not biased to having received a free pair and is a genuine review.EDIT: 5/21/20 - These earbuds now frequently disconnect from each other and from all of my devices. While I only have one device on and connected at a time, they all experience the same issue when connected to the earbuds: Sound will constantly fade in and out, drop out at times, and the earbuds will frequently disconnect from the devices entirely. The only solution I have found is to turn the devices' Bluetooth on/off to reconnect. To mitigate the issue, the devices need to be as close as possible to the earbuds and must remain within a 1-2 ft length otherwise the issues will start. Not sure what caused this to happen, though I suspect the daily use has degraded the earbuds functionality. In any case, I have my Pixel Buds on the way from Google which have received amazing reviews.",3,1,2019-10-30,1,1,1
"I decided to buy these when my iphone autonomously decided that wired headphones should be obsolete, spontaneously abandoning this capacity in the midst of an engrossing listen. In sheer contempt toward apple products, I decided to go for anything that would not have me dump money on the company that rendered my perfectly good headphones useless. I was initially going to go for the kind of wireless headphones that every modern youtuber is currently peddling, but in a bout of stubborn attachment to my scarce monetary resources, I decided to look on amazon for the cheapest reasonably-reviewed alternative. And I'm glad! These are perfectly functional, and even slightly less ugly than the apple variety.If you are the kind of person who uses headphones for reasonable things like listening to music while exercising or listening to audiobooks as you work, these suffice. If you're the kind of listener who pretends you can tell the difference between MP3 and FLAC, though... yeah, you might still want to buy these, as you'll be miserable regardless what you purchase and you might as well save a few bucks.",5,1,2020-7-23,1,1,0
"Sound quality is above average to good for the price point. Bluetooth range is adequate and comparable to my Bose Quietcomfort 35 II. Passive noise isolation is also adequate at this price point. Just make sure you get a good seal in your ear canal.However, there are two issues; first is that the lowest volume that can still produce sound on these headphones is still fairly loud. For example, even on the lowest volume setting that can produce sound (one notch above no sound at all), these headphones is comparable to standard wired low impedance headphones (e.g., apple headphones that comes with an iPhone) set to 20%-30% volume.",3,1,2020-3-15,1,2,0
"I've given this a 4 star rating only because when it comes to calling the right earbud will be quieter than the left.

"Amending my review to a 5 star because this company reached out to me with an offer to replace the defective earbuds at no cost to me.  They are sending a new set.  If the replacement product has the same issue, I will update my review again.  So far, very pleased by the company reaching out on this.The sound generated by this product is phenomenal despite some negative reviews I read before purchasing.  Despite that, I do have one complaint about this product; the silicone earbud covers that are provided in varying sizes were very poorly constructed and split upon removal from the device.  When changing the earbuds to another size, I found they were extremely difficult to remove from the device itself.  Consequently, one of the silicone earbuds split when I removed it from the device.  It is impossible to remove the earbud covers gently or with ease.  The split occurred between the top (mushroom) part that inserts into your ear and the tube part that connects the cover to the device.  Unfortunately, the size that split happens to be the size that worked best for my ears.  I will now have to make do with the other sizes provided, which will affect the noise-canceling feature.",5,1,2020-4-28,1,1,0
"I chose these earbuds because I did not want to spend the high dollar amount on the name brands. I had high hopes these would give off good sound quality and thankfully they did not disappoint! The sound is clear with good bass. When I have both earbuds in and music on I cannot hear anyone talking to me. They are actually a little TOO good at cancelling noise. I have three kids that I always need to keep an earshot out for. Most of the time I just wear one so I can “mom” at the same time. But I love to wear both and crank the music up when I’m working out and drown out everything. I also use them to do my guided meditation to block our noise. You can answer and talk on the phone with these as well. They last me for as long as I need which usually is upwards of 6 hours and even at that I have yet to get a low battery notification. They’d probably go much longer. The case charges wired or wirelessly. On my wireless charger I can get a full charge on the case in less than an hour. I can go up to a week between charges too, but this depends on how much I use it. I liked them so much I already bought a second pair for my husband. I’ve owned mine for about 4 months now. Highly recommend.",5,1,2020-7-8,1,1,1

"Just the earbuds I needed. I was still rocking my old Beats wireless earset that were a gift years ago, you know the ones that are just tied to one another and the cable hands on the back of your neck. The cable holding them together would be really annoying at times and eventually it stripped down at the ends and stopped working. I decided I needed true wireless ear buds, but didnt want to spend a fortune. Enter Tozo.Luckily good things come to those who wait and I've waited so long to replace my earphones that Tozo has made various earbuds at the $25-50 range that fit my needs. I settled on this design though because they look round and sleek like airpods , have great sound (that bass though!), good comfort with different size options on the inserts, and the case is small  with that cool magnetic pull we all love so much. I got mine in black but I'm sure I'll order the rose gold eventually for my gf as well. She has airpods but she's had to replace them twice already, so I would rather have her try these out next.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
"Update 05/20/2020I was contacted by Sharon from TOZO who let me know how upset they were to hear of my experience. She explained that she believed I might have had a defective pair of earbuds as my experience was not common at all. She expressed TOZO's willingness to improve my experience and offered to replace the earbuds at no cost to me, provide a gift card for a future purchase, or refund my original payment for the defective item. As I had already purchased a different set of earbuds, I chose the refund. I wish I had waited for TOZO to reach out before buying a different set elsewhere because I value a manufacturer that stands by their product and their customers the way TOZO has. Because of their willingness to make a bad situation into a good situation, I have updated my review. In the future, I will consider TOZO's products once again. TOZO clearly believes in their products and I have no reason not to believe that I happened to receive a defective item.",5,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0
EDITED:My biggest fear when purchasing this earbud was if it would stay in my ears and not fall off  since my ears are very small . well the shape of it does not help. It totally sticks out and falls. The battery life would far looks like is durable.,4,1,2020-1-17,1,5,0
"Update: I’ve had these a few months now. Honestly, they’re not that great. The longer they go, the crappier they get. They never turn off when I put them back in the case (staying connected to my phone and draining the battery) and when I put them on to charge, they reconnect to my phone, even whilst in the case. They are very OK. Definitely not worth the $65 I paid for them. Also, the inability to easily switch between devices is so frustrating. Seriously, how hard can that be to add?There are a million “true-wireless” headphones on amazon. I spent a lot of time going through them. I didn’t want to have to buy and return several.",2,1,2019-11-8,1,5,0
"After using these earbuds for about a week and a half now, I can easily say they're overall great quality. They get some getting used to in terms of feel, but when it comes to battery life, sound and so forth they're generally pretty good.The problem comes down to the ""warranty"". They offer a year and some months as a free warranty, so I decided ""why not?"" and went to set it up. It's been a good few days since I've done the warranty, and therefore while I can't remember every detail I can remember the main aspects. It asks for your email (note that I never have gotten an email confirming this so called warranty), and doesn't ask for any order number or so forth (not that it would matter, since your warranty card doesn't give you an order number like one would expect would be included). After you finish the warranty section, it advances you to a ""VIP program"", that screamed out as the biggest scam ever. Even so, I was curious and checked it out, and as soon as you click over to the page they ask you to not tell anyone else about this program because it's a ""special deal just for you"". The reality is that they don't want you telling anyone else because it would make it obvious that they're buying reviews (if they even send the $20 products they're offering - one being an extra carrying case and another being a wireless charging pad).",3,1,2020-6-9,1,5,0
"Tthese headphones are absolutely terrible.  Let me start by saying that I ordered 2 pairs of these a few weeks ago; 1 is my husbands and 1 is mine.  My husbands work fine- they pair easily, battery is great as is sound quality.Mine, however are a disaster.  The microphone is so sensitive that ANY slight noise happening around me is so incredibly loud to the person on the other end of the line that I can't use these for phone conversations unless I am muted. They paired easily enough with my iPhone, MacBook and Mac, however, they are terrible for trying to connect to a device when you want to use them with a specific device.  For some reason they seem to connect to a device even once they've been disconnected and the ear buds shut off.  Sometimes they reconnect to my phone (even after they've been disconnected from bluetooth and turned off) and I won't even know it.  Then if I want to use them with my MacBook or Mac, I have to go back into all my other devices and disconnect them (again) from bluetooth (even though this is already done as soon as I am done with them).  I had to remove them from my MacBook entirely in an attempt to get them to reconnect and now they will not pair with the MacBook at all.  I am getting a message that I need a code for the headphones.  It is so incredibly frustrating.",1,1,2020-4-19,1,3,0
"This is a nice upgrade from the T10 earbuds. Everything is better, but the touch sensitive buds gets a little annoying when it touches my ear and turns down or up the volume. Overall great product. Will update after at least a week of having them.Update: Straight away I would give a 2.5 star rating. It has now been pretty much two months of owning these. So far, they are not that good of an upgrade from the T10. For some reason, they occasionally will disconnect themselves from my computer and phone for no reason while I'm in the middle of listening to something. I’ve seen this problem with someone else too. Also, when I put them in the charging case, if the charging case dies while charging the earbuds at night, I wake up to the earbuds dead as well! So the case died while charging them at during the night, and then the earbuds just ran out of power for reason I guess. Along with that, sometimes the earbuds will randomly connect to my phone when they are still in the charging case, which is not supposed to happen. When in the case, they should be turned off and charging, but sometimes that doesn’t happen. The sound quality has also gotten absurdly horrible when when I use it with my computer, but it may just be my PC lagging, who knows. The touch sensitivity still is cool, but quickly gets annoying when a tiny bit touches your ear or gets wet and then the earbuds are stuck trying to lower and raise the volume. Sometimes if One earbud starts dying, I will take the other one out and let them connect to each other (Supposedly that also will connect to the host device) and then put the dead one away, the second earbud will not connect to the device automatically. I have done this numerous times with these earbuds and a different pair and that would work, but now these ones have problems sometimes trying to connect. Lastly, the earbuds have problems pausing a video or song when i tap it once too, so thats a little annoying. Maybe I just have a bad pair, and I would recommend getting these still, but be aware that there will probably be problems that occur.",4,1,2020-5-4,1,5,0
This is an updated review because I am actually HUGELY impressed with TOZO! My first review wasn't good and I believe I received a bad fluke set of these earbuds.  I had returned them and was refunded. The company reached out to me and offered me to try a new pair so i accepted.  Let me tell you...I am SO GLAD i accepted. i received my new set and they are FANTASTIC.  Sound is phenomenal and the pair very easily.  I have had zero issues with this set. I want to personally thank the customer service i received.  I buy on Amazon quite a bit and this situation was not only rectified but to a point that my review changed from 1 star to 5. These are just perfect. I would highly recommend them and the company which made me so happy and surprised by helping me to know these really are just as good if not BETTER than ANY other brand I've had in my ears. They stay put no matter what I'm doing and the sound...just wow! Thank you Thank you!!!!!🙂🙂🙂,5,1,2020-2-6,1,4,0

For the money and considering I've only used these ear buds for 1 day they are an exceptional buy. I work mostly outdoors (Florida) in grounds keeping with noisy equipment and lots of sweat. They charged quickly and paired without issue. The range from transmitting device is basic at best with them occasionally losing signal when phone is in pocket and I bend over and have my ear muffs on. I can get about 30' away from phone if there isn't any obstructions. They hold their charge well. They are pretty comfortable to wear especially since I typically have ear muffs over them. As for noise canceling I don't notice any difference than any other in ear bud but my ear muffs fit over these just fine.My only complaint really is the sound quality. Mids and highs are decent for this price range but there isn't really any lows. They are small devices so I'm not looking to thump but I'm not impressed compared to others I've worn.,4,1,2020-5-23,1,1,0
Not worth the money. Iv has these for a few months now and the right earbud has stopped charging correctly. Some times it doesn’t work at all. Other times it charges for a while then stops charging and it’s light turns off. Do your self a flavor and buy a set from a name brand company.

My ear buds, I purchased the pink ones, would play music the moment I put them in my ears. All settings on my phone are set to not do this. I do not have this issue with any other earbuds. They also would not stay connected and I would put them in, connect them and then do a live stream chat only to find the had disconnected and people could hardly hear me!

"I am an Audiophile. Well am ""Audiobookpbile"" and with over 500 books on my audible account I have been through no less them 20 true wireless buds.  I own many to the brand names Best Buy found buds and many low awareness buds found on Amazon.  My favorite buds under $100 are actually the GoNovate Airo.  However though highly popular it does seem that GoNovate cares to improve and develop that product. These TOZO T6 are better then the precious version. Jam packed with features and specs. Better specks then most $200 earbug. However all of that means nothing if the fit was not so backward. Like the previous modem they still don't seat comfortably in my ears and this is rare for me.  What'd the point of IPX8?  I was pumped to find a new pair of shower buds. Unfortunately, while impressively waterproof it stinks when using in water. My entire shower anytime a drop of water hit the buds the volume would turn all the way up or down.  It the unit would turn off. At one time the left bud was turning down while the right was turning up. The touch surface is not good for waterproof earbuds.  Since I purchased them for shows use, I must give an honest 2.  If they worked on the shower is easily say a 4 star.",2,1,2020-5-29,1,1,1
"Great earbuds. I've had apple, I've had other TOZO's, I've had a few off-brands. This one is nearly as good as apple with a few areas winning and maybe one or two losing. Overall, the price clearly wins. The technology is there, and the sound quality; the water proof, the touch control (volume, next/back, play/pause,etc.), the ear fit (being able to work out, run hard, and use either ear bud or both without them falling out), the looks, and the size of the carrying case make this an outstanding set of ear buds--definitely top 2 I've ever had. Battery life is outstanding. I charge the case once every few days, and the earbuds stay charged nearly always. The carrying case is as small as apple pods. Wireless charging is great. Only complaint is the earbuds themselves tend to be a bit slippery when i try to take them out of the earbud case.  Well done Tozo. Their products continue to improve. This was a vast improvement from their T-10's I had before this.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,3,0
"*UPDATE: customer service promptly reached out to me and sent me a brand new pair of their newest model, free of charge. Thank you!*I bought these a few months ago. When I received them, I opened them up and began to charge them right away so I could get to trying them out as soon as possible. They seemed really nice at first, but for some reason, I could not get the left earbud to work. It was definitely on, because there was a constant static noise coming from it (like what you would expect to hear if the music you were listening to was paused). It also was not lowering the volume when I tapped on it, but the right one would increase the volume just fine. At first I assumed it was something I was doing wrong- maybe I hadn’t let it fully charge, or maybe I had not properly paired them with my phone. I let them charge a while longer and tried again, carefully reading the pairing instructions, but to no avail. Audio& proper functionality from the right earbud, but only static from the left one. Really disappointed I missed the return window for these; I wasted fifty bucks on a broken item.",4,1,2020-6-20,1,3,0
"So I ordered these a month ago from Amazon. I was amazed how compact the charging case was, also the earbuds were nice and compact in size, plus it came with a variety of sizes of earbud tips to give a snug fit into your ear canal. Great packaging options, sleek in design, touch sensitive earbuds to control your music, volume, and answering phone calls.But the thing is I had to returned it back to Amazon. The reason for the return was I felt that the volume was limited. I did a firmware update from tozo website and I thought it would solve the problem but it didn't. So I return them. A few weeks later tozo saw my review and thought it was probably a defective item. So they sent me another one just to be sure.  Again I checked them out, they fit great and snug in my ear, the size of the case is amazing so compact in design just love them, but the volume is still limited. At a 100% I'm asking for more volume because it isn't loud enough.",4,1,2020-4-20,1,3,0
"I wanted to like these headphones. I gave it several tries over 24 hours of use. I just cant use them.First the magical ""touch"" controls sound like a great idea. Until just wearing the headphones causes the volume to change or the headphones to power off. Apparently the position of the ear bud in my ear caused it to bump against my ear and that made the bud think it was being touched. This is what ultimately made me decide to stop using the ear buds.",1,1,2020-5-23,1,5,0
"The good: I liked them for the call quality. People had no problem hearing me and I was able to hear most people loud and clear. Earbuds were ok for music. I prefer a bit more base. No problem using them while taking a shower.The bad: They disconnect way too easily. Sometimes in the middle of a call, other times because I moved my head, touched the pillow by accident, adjusted them while on a call and they instantly disconnected. Happened during several conference calls as well. The charging case didn't hold a charge very long and I was charging the case about every day. I have another pair of earbuds and they hold the charge for several days. I bought them 3 months ago, used them for less than 2 months infrequently, and now the charging case won't charge anymore which renders the earbuds useless. Very disappointing since I bought them after reading all the positive reviews.",1,1,2020-4-24,1,5,0
"I was skeptical at first that any earbuds fitting inside the ear would actually work well for phone calls. I am more than a bit surprised at the sound quality. They work wonderfully for phone calls. I use them for work; on some days I have 3 or 4 conference calls back to back. These buds have not let me down yet. Their range is wonderful too. I can set my cell phone where it has a good signal and have no fear of losing the signal or people on the other end having any problems hearing me. For work and calls, I use only one earbud at a time, left or right, makes no difference. One tap answers my phone. For listening to music, I use both and the surround sound quality is magnificent. No muffled voices or fuzziness. Clear sound quality. I was so impressed, I bought my daughter a pair for Yule and she has worn them to work out several times telling me they work wonderfully. Linking them to my phone was a breeze and I can switch between my work phone and personal phone quickly.The one downside is these can only be connected to one phone at a time, so when I switch, I have to physically disconnect from my work phone and then connect to my personal phone. But that is the only negative I have found so far and it is negligent when compared to the overall quality of these ear buds.  I highly recommend these ear buds for both music AND Phone calls.",5,1,2019-12-22,1,4,0
"Very impressed, especially for the price!  I lost one side of an expensive Bose pair and have two other cheaper pairs that are just OK.  One has a wire between the left and right which is annoying, and the other is good enough for podcasts but not great for music.  I figured I'd give the Tozo T6 a try and I'm happy to report now I don't need to spend the extra money for a replacement fancy pair - these are 99% as good for a quarter of the price.  Sound quality is superb, especially after adjusting the iPhone EQ to add a little more base and reduce the slight treble hiss - just as good as the Bose.  They worked well for a phone call also.  These are also very well built - they have the look and feel of a much more expensive product.  The touch feature is great and much easier to use than the buttons on my other models (including Bose).  I love the form factor - very small - with the little recharging case, which can be charged wirelessly. Who wants to carry a USB cable with truly wireless earbuds?  The case is lightweight and rounded, no sharp edges or corners like one of my other pairs that can be uncomfortable in running shorts.  These fit my ears right out of the box, but there are several different size earbuds included.  These are nice earbuds, not cheap ones, and they stay in my ear perfectly while also blocking out surrounding noise.  They stay in my ear much better than my other pairs.  But be warned they are sleek and can be a little slippery, especially if you're sweating at the gym, and I have dropped them while taking them out of my ears just from being slippery.  In conclusion, these are fantastic, better than I expected for the price, and I highly recommend them.UPDATE: I received a pair of AirPod Pros as a gift.  Yeah, I have to say, the AirPods do sound better than these, but for the price, the AirPods are not THAT much better to be worth five times the price.  For podcasts, audio books, and talking on the phone these Tozo T6s are just as good as the AirPods (although the sound masking of the Pros is amazing but when off the T6's are just as good).  For music these T6's can't compete on the base, but again they are a fifth the price and for something so small that I'm sure i'll lose them, I'll continue to use these T6's outside of the house and just keep the AirPods for use at home because I'm afraid of losing them.",5,1,2019-10-31,1,4,0
I've been using these for about a month now and haven't had any issues yet. I had a choice between these or a pair of Enact earphones. So I ended up getting the Tozo T6. I'm overall happy with the decision. Still no way to compare with the others though. If I had to make the decision again I'd probably stick with these.I've listed below my pro and con list for these earbuds. The only con that really gets me is the touch sensor activating in the shower. The others aren't bad. The most useful feature may be the volume control!,5,1,2020-1-12,1,4,0

"I was looking to upgrade from wired earbuds to wireless earbuds so that I could teach Zoom exercise classes without microphone interference. The microphone on my Powerbeats earbuds - located on the wire connecting the earpieces together - kept swinging and touching my cheek, which caused an annoying static sound and made me incomprehensible to my clients at times. I needed an upgrade, but I didn't want to buy an expensive pair of Airpods, so I read the reviews and took a shot with the Tozo T-6.My main concern was microphone quality and these earbuds have worked perfectly with clarity and no static. I'm able to give clear, uninterrupted in my Zoom classes. As a bonus I'm able to exercise and go on runs with no issues keeping them in my ears. A great product at a great price.",5,1,2020-3-25,1,6,0
"I received these for free as a promotion for purchasing another set of wireless earbuds (the T10) from TOZO. I love that they pair instantly with each other once you pull them out of their case, which was a problem with the T10 earbuds, IMO. Some may like to use one earpiece at a time; I personally do not. Once I found one ear paired with my phone and the other paired with my iPad, each playing different music!It's weird...these seem smaller and I find myself thinking they would fit differently in my ear and create a more ""sealed"" sound, but they don't. Maybe I need to change the earpiece a size down to remedy this issue.",5,1,2019-9-19,1,2,1
"PROS:- Nice wide range of audio, including rich bass frequencies.",4,1,2020-8-7,1,1,0
"As something less expensive than other sets I own and love, I decided to try these out. Arrived in a day. I charged the case and earbuds, which also has six sets of various replacement tips. The case itself is slightly larger than the original AirPods case.I figured I would try them out real quick. Took them out of the case, inserted into my ears, instantly I could hear they were pairing. No button pressing or waiting for lights to flash red and blue. Grabbed my phone, Bluetooth, there they were at the bottom of the list. Connected. That was quick and easy.",5,1,2020-8-19,1,1,0
Have been using it for a month now since I got it. Found 2 main points that I deem negative.  1 point for improvement (in my opinion ) and the rest was very much inline with the product page.The 2 points are:,3,1,2020-9-20,1,1,0
"So I first bought these back in April of this year, and there were amazing! I can be three rooms away from my phone and my music would still be playing with ABSOLUTELY no interruption or cutting out in the audio. It sounded really amazing! And only for $50 (they did drop the price to $35 and has brought it back up to $43) compared to paying an arm and a leg for apple airpods. But then only 3 months of having it, and using it regularly, not dropping it, not being rough with and definitely not swimming with them in; it started to act up. I would bearly turn my head away from my phone, while holding it less than a foot away, the audio would cut in and out. I would set my phone down, same thing. I tried resetting the damn thing and can never get it to flash purple. I resetted my bluetooth on my phone, restarted my phone, turned my phone off for five minutes and turned it back on. I did everything that I could possibly do on my end more than 30 times just to bring these back to how they were. Nothing worked. So seeing that I had a one year warranty on em, I messaged the seller, explained everything word for word that I just put in here. And they responded ""Have you tried resetting the earbuds?"" And when I tried to respond via email no matter which button I clicked on it always take me to Amazon website and say ""Thank you for your feedback!"" I then went through Amazon themselves got a replacement one. They were worse than the first one. I charged them till it was full battery,  took them out, linked them to my phone via bluetooth. Same exact problem if not worse! Turn my head ""disconnected"", put my phone down ""disconnected "". So I reset them and they turned purple! So I thought okay that fixes that....nope! So I decided I would take them to work and see if I can fix it there! I put the case with BOTH earbuds inside of it in my back pocket and went to work. I got to work, took the case out of my back pocket, opened the case and there was only one in there. They had changed the quality in the case because where as with the first one that I PAID $50 the lid would stay closed even when I put in in my pockets, this one that was a REPLACEMENT the lid would open little to no force, thus causing a bud to go missing. If the replacement I had recieved is their newer model, then dont get it. I have look high and low for that earbud, but it most likely got lost while I was on my way to work. I've had DOLLAR STORE headphones that lasted for two years and I'm a hell of a lot rougher with those than I was with these bluetooth headphones!!",1,1,2020-8-14,1,1,0
"I had the T10 earbuds and the T6 model was offered as a free gift from TOZO for a ""kind review.""I've read about issues with wireless earbuds where moving your head would cut out the sound, or, perhaps they just cut out periodically as you move about. I had this before myself. With a prior pair of earbuds, I had to make sure my phone was in my right pocket otherwise they would periodically disconnect. I took the T6 earbuds on a walk today around my neighborhood and they worked flawlessly. No cut outs between the left and right or between the phone and the earbuds. Phone was in my left pocket which is normal for me. I even walked away from my phone a room or so and stayed connected just fine. The Bluetooth connectivity seems really good!",5,1,2019-10-11,1,2,0
These are some great earbuds at this price point along with awesome support! I’ve highlighted my thoughts for those interested:Size - the case is compact and easily fits in your pocket for running errands or walking around the office. Earbuds fit my ears perfectly and stay in place even under rigorous use.,5,1,2020-6-5,1,1,0

"I would like to start by saying, I have used headphones ranging from dollar store to a 400$ pair of Klipsch, so I know a thing or two about quality headphones. VERY IMPORTANT: Earbuds will take about 80+ hours of use before they sound their best (burn in period). At first, they will sound very low and staticky at max volume, compared to after 80+ hours. For those first 80 hours, keep the volume set between 75-100% (whatever your general listening volume will be).I always let them play for 80 hours, while I am not using them, before I write a review. Overall listening experience can change THAT DRASTICALLY from the first time you put them in, to after that 80+ hour burn in period. They will sound louder and clearer after this point.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,2,0
"Surprised to be so disappointed after reading so many good reviews.Major problem is that when one specific earbud is in the charging case the charging lights NEVER turn off, causing it to drain the battery till it dies. This happens regardless of if the charging case is plugged in or not. It’s only one earbud that is causing this behavior.",2,1,2020-9-3,1,1,0
Had quality issues with 2 pairs of T10's I believe related to waterproofing with normal use in shower and pool at a level they easily should have stood up to.  Decided to try the newer model instead of a 3rd pair.So glad I did.  These are superior in every way from size to battery life to sound.,1,1,2020-7-10,1,1,0
"This purchase, ironically, was made on a whim. Very glad that I did follow through with this purchase. These are amazing earbuds that are SOLID and DELIVERS for the price! If you're in the market for a pair of wireless bluetooth ear buds that can deliver in both form and function [and wont break the bank like the $250.00 Apple Airpods that I had to return did] - the TOZO T6 is it. Take the chance - you'll be glad you did.PROS:",5,1,2020-9-7,1,2,0
Give it a full day before judge these beautiful earbuds.Sound quality improves after 10 min of playing music through it.,3,1,2020-9-2,1,1,0
"Sound quality was great. I initially returned these because they felt too bulky and got soundpeats true capsule instead because of the size and ear fit, but quickly realized that the soundpeats controls are difficult to use and I’ve been having problems with only one ear connecting (very annoying!) Tried these again, and they don’t have connection problems like the soundpeats at all so that’s been soooo nice. They are a little bulkier but they stay in ear fine and comfortably, even on a run. They come with several different ear fittings so you can choose the size/shape that best fits your ear, which is really great. Packaging, shipping, and customer service are all great.——",2,1,2020-3-9,1,1,0
These things sound great and they do cancel noise pretty well. So why 2 stars then? Because they have a mind of their own.I have to make sure I am looking at the changing light when I put them in the case to ensure they are making contact and actually charging.,2,1,2020-7-18,1,1,0
"I am a senior, and this is my first experience with earbuds. I had researched them, and decided on the TOZO T6. When they arrived (on time), I slid open the box lid and found the instructions on top. This was very helpful, as I resisted the urge to take everything apart, and just sat down and read the directions first. They were very easy to pair, and in no time I was listening to my favorite music on my iPad. I did find I needed to change the buds to a smaller size, and having read another person’s review, knew that you needed to do a little bit of prying to get them off, and the new ones on, but once in place, they were very comfortable. I am still learning how to tap the correct bud the right number of times to do the different functions, but that’s just a learning curve that will soon become automatic for me. I am very pleased with these, and highly recommend them.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,1,0
"I've used these a few times now and have to say the experience has been the best I've had to date with wireless earbuds.  They came well packaged with clear instructions and paired immediately with each other seamlessly in the background and to my phone without a single issue...unlike many of the other pairs I've tried over the years.The sound quality is great, and noise cancellation is also better than other pairs I've used although I must admit I always pair my earbuds with foam earpieces so I'm not using the stock rubber ones.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,1,0
"Fits in ear very well. Has excellent noice cancellation aspects, even if there is no sound playing. It charges ear pods fast. Nice indicator for battery life on case. Durable.Things I don’t like. Using it as a way of talking on the phone, sounds weird to me and the people on the other side has a hard time hearing me unless it is absolutely quiet where I am. If water get on it in any form it will skip tracks or start the song over, maybe pause it. You just never know. It gets quite annoying. Sometimes it will disconnect from my phone and the only way to get it connected to hear your music you would have to take them out and put it back in the case and try it again. When you take them out of your ear and put them I. The case you have to touch the spot that is the button so it will start your music or movie and once they are in the case my phone goes to loud speaker.

"My daughter wanted a pair of AirPod Pros (@$250) for Christmas. All I could think of was she will lose 1 of them and how frustrating that would be. I saw the Tozo T6 as Amazon recommended and did some research. I wasn't that excited about paying > $25 for a pair of earphones when you can grab a pair of wired ones for a regular audio jack for a few dollars but went ahead and bought a pair for myself to test. Results...1. Case is nice size, style and weight. About the same size as the regular AirPods (another daughter has a pair). Feels solid in your hand and pods are well protected to throw in a pocket or car console. Only con is the first earphone is a little tricky to pull out, but you get used to it pretty quickly. Once first is out, second is no problem.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,1,1
"I purchased these early in 2020, so I've been using them for 4-5 months.  In general, they're pretty good earbuds:  not great, but significantly better than most $40-50 wireless earbuds.Sound quality is good, bass is average (BassBooster app can fix this, or Samsung phones have a pretty good built-in equalizer), mids and highs are very good, clear but not harsh.",4,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"This is the first time I've owned true wireless earbuds, so I have nothing to compare these to. However, I find these to be great! They came packaged so well and you can definitely tell they're new. Was very impressed with the packaging once I opened the box. Only thing lacking regarding that, is the directions were not very thorough. As a first time user it took me a few to figure some things out. As for the sound... I am a fan of good bass when I listen to music and I listen to music very loudly. These earbuds exceeded my expectations with regards to the bass and overall sound. I'm sure there are better sound qualities out there when you want to pay a higher price but these are just perfect for me. Because I listen to music loudly, these definitely cancelled out all noise for me. I tested them with no music on and just in my ears and they still did a decent job with getting rid of some outside noises.I like that they came with several different sized ear pads to put in my ears and get the perfect fit. I have worked maintenance with them in, I have walked, lifted weights, rode a bike and have gotten very sweaty and these still stayed in my ears. I can't speak to whether they are truly waterproof because I haven't been in the rain or other situations where I could test them out more in regards to then being waterproof. The battery life in the earbuds has exceeded 4 hours of continuous play time so far, I haven't used them longer than that yet. The charging station needs to be charged every day or 2, depending on usage. I just plug the cord into my laptop and charge it, and it didn't take long at all to get to a full charge.",5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,1
"So I got these because what I was looking for was a pair of earbuds that were good for talking on the phone.  I tend to talk while I do tasks around my house and trying to hold on to a phone is a pain as most of my lounging clothes do not have pockets.  So, I did A LOT of research about earbuds best for talking and these kept coming up, and the price was right.  I tested them on the first day a bunch.  I did a video conference and everyone could hear me and I them.  I had them on in my shower and they worked as well.  (not a habit I have, but I wanted to see if their claims were true.) Plus my ears are a shape that rejects the apple earbuds, but these are pretty good.  There are a couple drawbacks which is why they aren't a perfect 5 star.  First, Running water drowns me out to the listener.  I was sitting on my balcony and it was raining and my friend couldn't hear me anymore, but she was clear as a bell.  Second, as I mentioned my ears don't always like earbuds, so I have to adjust the often during a call.  They are VERY sensitive to touch.  I have accidentally hung up on people while adjusting or accidentally picked up an incoming call while I was already on the phone.  I want to do a little more research and see if I can disable the controls on the earbuds, I don't need it.  Finally they are a little tricky to get out of the charging case, and sometimes they don't pair with each other correctly because of it. But if I put them back in the case for a second then pull them back out it's fine.  However, I like that I can use just one, and often have.  I have never pushed the battery to its limit.  The longest I wore them was about 4 hours. Satisfied, it does what I purchased it for.",4,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0
"These sound very good! They connect to my Iphone 11 Pro Max perfectly. I like that I can use either earpiece as a bluetooth for my phone ( or both in ear, but difficult to hear yourself talk to the other party.. ) and my brother says he can hear me fine. He does say he can hear the sounds around me though. I had purchased a set of GUSGU earbuds before these, and overall they sound much better. But they wouldn't connect to my 11 Pro Max ! They had highs that were pristine and clear. The Tozo's have punchier wonderful bass, but the highs can get a bit tinny.. not bad though. I do have a small  "" complaint "" ... the buds are hard to get out of the case.. maybe the T10's would be easier with the flat case... Like I said the bass is wonderful!!!  Oh, and I haven't used long enough ( maybe an hour at a time ) to check battery life, but as with all of these, they come with the battery case.. so no worries there..  As of the time of me writing this review, they were still $39 with coupon.. so Get Them!",4,1,2019-12-7,1,2,0
"On the plus side, it paired immediately with my Samsung A30 and the connection was sustained throughout my small house. I should add that there was a very low level of white noise. Unfortunately, it failed to block background noise to a helpful degree, the frequency response below 800 Hz was attenuated, and voices were distorted - I'd guess about 4%. When earbuds fail to block background noise and bass response is poor, it's usually because the fit in the ear canal is poor. I tried all the adapters, but none fixed the problems. I also used the Samsung custom audio profile. That didn't improve frequency response either.  Finally, removing the earbuds from the charging case is difficult using only fingers.",3,1,2020-1-1,1,2,0
"I love these headphones. The size is perfect. They stay in your ears comfortably and legitimately cancel outside sounds. The battery life and Bluetooth range is the best I’ve had and I’ve gone through 5-6 other bluetooth headsets.  Where these totally fail is with the fingerprint/touch pads.  They’re a failure.  Turning on works, turning them off never ever works and you must put them in the case.  The slightest bit of any skin contact will pause music... the pause button sensitivity is absurd and infuriating.  A slightly longer touch on the surface with skip your song/video/media... also infuriating. Randomly though it’ll reverse instead of advance. The software voice that lets you know it’s going in reverse is comically bad. It sounds like a female robot having her power source pulled.  Any attempt to swipe, hold or push to do any of the functions they advertise never ever work.  If you remove them from your case, push play on your device, control media from your device and then turn them off by replacing them to the case... they’re awesome.  If you want buttons that function and so what you want, go with the physical push button surface versions and don’t bother with the failure touch surface versions.",4,1,2020-1-11,1,1,0
"I got these as an upgrade for T10s which I already thought were near perfect. And these are a step up! I don't understand what you could possible wish for beyond these... Great sound, good battery life, good touch controls (especially for music - which was the only issue with the T10s IMO), and the case is so nice to the touch and small.Single con: My wife says the are too bulky to sleep with so if you planning on falling asleep with these and you sleep on the side or belly maybe don't get these.",5,1,2019-11-27,1,3,0
"Before I purchased this I was concerned whether these little earbuds would produce enough bass compared to my Airpods. Turns out that the Tozo T6 significantly has more bass than my Airpods! To achieve this, you will need to make sure that the earbuds are fully inserted into your ear canal. It should have a snug fit. Having the earbuds even slightly out of your ear canal can diminish the sound quality (I tested this). Remember, these are ""in-ear"" earbuds. Not your standard ear buds where it sits just outside your ear canal.Pros: Heavy bass, small footprint, touch controls, wireless charging case",4,1,2019-12-6,1,2,0
"Update:I got in touch with Tozo regarding the battery life issues, since that seems like a product defect, and they've offered to replace the earbuds free of charge.  I'm therefore tentatively bumping my rating up to 4 stars based on the presumption this will fix the battery life issues and for their excellent customer service.  As I've used the touch interface more it's still not as seamless as I'd like, but I find myself less annoyed by it.",4,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
"I’ve used several Bluetooth earbuds In the past few years, mostly cheap ones because they were so tiny I figured I’d lost them anyway. This one has been the most expensive ones I’ve used. I wasn’t impressed. In fact, I’m going back to the cheap ones I can find on Amazon. Reasons, 1, the touch commend never worked with my Kindle Fire. 2, with my iPhone and iPod, it disconnected for no reason and sometimes more than once in an hour of using. I had to turn off Bluetooth and reconnect again to get it to work. 3, the touch commends were slow to react or no reaction at all. 4, I have contacted the seller, took two emails for them to reply. Oh, and their recommendation (do a reset every time I encounter a problem) is not working for me.

"This is for BOTH the T10 and T6 TOZO EarBuds:  Purchased two of the T10 earbuds for myself and son (in Khaki and Blue). Loved them, no problems at all.  The push button can be a little tricky since you are pushing into the ear to use those functions (mute, forward, back, etc), but you get the hang of it and learn how to grip the bud to click it rather than push it ""into"" the ear.  I like that you can pop the bud out while the music is still playing and pop back in, as opposed to the T6 which is touch sensitive and you only need to tap lightly.  But again, you learn not to paw the bud and you grip by the side instead.  The T6 does save stress on the ear because it requires so little effort to tap.  If you have large hands and get frustrated easily, you may opt for the Push of the T10 over the Tap of the T6 so you are not always hitting pause or forward, etc.I lost one T10 bud, and found the newer T6 in Pink so I opted for those this time, simply because I love pink.  Turns out, the T6 buds will charge in the older (larger) T10 case! But not the other way around.  Sound quality is better on the T6.  HOWEVER you won't know what you are missing with the T10 if you don't own both.  So honestly I wouldn't use sound as a qualifier for purchase and really look at the cases, the tap vs push feature and the colors (my humble opinion).  The T10 case is bulkier, but has a see thru lid, which I like and a loop to hook it to something for carrying.  The T6 is slimmer and can slid into your pocket or purse easier.  Removing the buds from either case is easy, however, easier from the larger T10 case.  The T6 does require a little more pinching to get them out. Again, not a make or break deal.  These buds, whichever you choose will not fall out when running or exercising, they are snug. Pop them in give a little wiggle turn and you are set!  Can't speak yet to the water proof feature.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,1
"***Updated Review***I tried these for a week just to see if I could get used to them, and they just don’t work for me. Touch controls are either too sensitive or don’t respond in tune, they turn on at a mere jostle (always having to check and make sure each one is legitimately off), my music list is limited because the starting volume is quite high and most of the songs are now too loud even at the lowest setting, and listening for half an hour on the lowest volume setting initiates inner ear pain (which I’ve never had with any earbuds). I’d rather pay the shipping to return these than try to work with them. The sound quality was good and the carrying case was super convenient for toting around, but they’re simply not worth the ear aches and the frustration with the touch controls.",3,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"I purchased/ received these earbuds about a week ago. I was very impressed by the packaging, as well as the look and feel of the product itself. The case is very small, lightweight, and shows you the amount of charge it has remaining. I do have a couple of gripes about this product, though. For one, the touch buttons are too sensitive and also not sensitive enough at the same time. I find myself accidentally pausing songs and then when I want to skip forward, it seems like I have to make several attempts before it actually does what I'm trying to accomplish. One thing I absolutely love about these as compared to the bluetooth earbuds that have a cord, is that when I run, these do not make my music sound like it's cutting in and out, or like it's ""jiggling"" if that makes sense. These buds stay put in my ears, and they don't try to fall out.. I just used the tips that came preinstalled on the buds,  but the addition of several other sizes was nice as well! There was one thing about these that was confusing.. I scanned the QR code on the side, and it brought me to a website that showed me how to download an app and update the firmware on the buds. I did what it said, but I found it odd that the app asked for access to my location, (why?) and my storage to my phone and everything.. I just found that odd.. so just beware, I'm not sure if that's totally safe or what. I just did what it asked and it said my earbuds were updated successfully. A couple more things.. I have not tested the waterproof claims of these, but I'm sure they're accurate. I didn't like how after completing the warranty setup, it asked me to write a review.. that seems like the company is trying to buy good reviews. Anyway, I like this product a lot. The sound quality is really pretty good.  I will come back and update if any issues arise. Hopefully this helped someone make a decision. I do recommend these.",5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"I looked around for months, and even bought a few other wireless earbud sets. I didn't want to pay the premium price for named brands, but I did want a pair that I could take anywhere. I found it in these little beauties. The buds fit in my ear well, are very light, have a long battery life and sound great! They can be used independently of one another, which enables me to listen to an audiobook or music or chat on the phone while I do other things and still hear people try to talk to me, dogs needing out, etc. I can access my phone assistant with a tap, pause music/book/answer calls, just like all the more expensive brands.When I have both in, it creates a wonderful sound bubble. The seal is quite good.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"Got these earbuds a few months ago and they worked great for a while. The sound quality is top notch for wireless ear buds. After changing to the smallest ear piece they stay in your ear perfectly. Battery life is quite good in comparison to how big the earbuds are. The charging for these ears buds is extremely quick as well.A couple things that I didn't like was when I took one of them out of the case every once in a while they would go into pairing mode forcing me to go into the Bluetooth settings to reconnect the earbuds manually. Now only a few months after getting them the left earbud will not stay turned off. Even inside the case it randomly connects to my phone when nearby. I also get a message pretty often that says ""Connection lost"" disconnecting from my phone. I have some galaxy buds my wife uses and I never have these issues. You get what you pay for.",2,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0

"OK, I was skeptical at first. Like you, I couldn't believe that a decent pair of true wireless headphones could be obtained for less than three digits. But, here we are. I picked up the Black T6's after contemplating for many months. I charted reviews and prices and finally purchased. Could they be the holy grail of auditory accessibility? I can say they are.After the case was fully charged, I took them out and both earbuds paired with each other in seconds.

"TOZO T6 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds is one of the Best-selling Earbuds on Amazon. I think their great follow up service is one of the many reasons for being one of the most popular wireless earbuds on Amazon, although their noise cancellation feature can further be boosted up in their next product generation for TOZO 7.They contacted me directly regarding the issue on TOZO T6 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds and get it fixed immediately in order to make sure customer is happy with the product.",5,1,2020-5-19,1,1,0
"This is my first pair of wireless earbuds. I looked at the pricier phone brands but didn't want to dive in at $125++. After reading many reviews, I decided on the T6. They're loaded with features but I was taking a bet on sound quality - which is really what earbuds are all about. I was expecting something on the order of $15 wired earbuds. Wrong. Some reviews said the bass was too weak, others said it boomed and clipped. My impression is that the bass is very present without being overpowering. The highs are very  crisp and enjoyable. If anything falls a little short, it might be the mid range, but not enough to make me feel it's deficient.  These are a viable alternative to my beloved Sennheiser wired headphones and earbuds. That said, I'm extremely pleased with a very balanced sound. Some people love the exaggerated bass and mid range of the over-hyped and overpriced B--e products. I don't and think the T6 are at a very sweet spot. The other features are outstanding. Try to find another sub$50 set of wireless earbuds with wireless charging, 5+ hour playtime, touch controls - it's hard to do. I think another pair is in my future to gift to a more discerning user. Highly recommended.  Tozo: how about a product with active noise cancellation?",5,1,2020-5-9,1,1,0
"Update 2:  My replacements arrived.  Great job by Tozo for quick support.  My first pair malfunctioned for about 16 hours until the has fully dried out after an accidental drop in a sink of water.  Makes me question the IPX 8 rating, but can’t question the support.  They sent a replacement pair “just to be sure”.  Kudos to Tozo.  And if this pair take an accidental bath and self recover, I can’t complain......On to the review currently in progress.",4,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
Let me start out by saying I'm not using these to listen to a lot of music so I won't comment them as an audiophile.  I use them to listen to podcasts while I'm working around the house or out for a walk.  Just going to do pros and cons as I see it for that use case.Pros:,2,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"Edit: 9/8/2020After trying out every single earbud attachment I have realized none are a good fit for my ear. None are bad enough to where I want to goto the trouble of returning these but still a bummer. The middle size""red"" ones do the best but I still have to adjust them regularly to keep the sound at peak seal. That is frustrating because each touch pauses your music. My last dog walk I made it through one song (painfully) and ended up pause/play'ing about 15 times. Very frustrating. When you do have the ""seal"" right in your ears and good quality music playing.. these do sound great. I just wish the ear inserts were better and also the audio volume being slightly higher would be great. But for $50.00 and BT5.0 and IP rated.. these are still worth it. OG review below.",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,1
"I’ll start with the cons because I know a lot of people are most interested in what they may not like before buying.These ARE waterproof, but work very poorly in the shower. Not because of their sound quality, but because of their design. I was probably most excited to be able to listen to music in the shower, but I won’t be trying it again. For turning the volume up and down, you have to touch and hold.  Water droplets got on them (naturally) and the water sitting on it messed up the touch control causing the volume to keep going up, and up, and up until it was blasting into my ears. The entire time, I was trying to stop it but I couldn’t get it to go back down because my fingers were wet. I had to pull them out to keep my ear drums from getting damaged. Before this happened, they also kept coming out of my ears due to the water and I didn’t want to risk it going down the drain. We have an old porcelain and cast iron bathtub/shower and it doesn’t have a grate over the drain.",4,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
"I refused to pay the price for Air Pods so I looked at MANY reviews of different wireless earphones that people liked as much as Air Pods and these fit the bill.  I am not a sound critic but I do enjoy listening to music and these have great sound. They are my first wireless earphones.They were easy to use after referring to the instructions many times to learn the sequence of taps. After tonight, I think I have it memorized and will be able to operate them easily. The only thing that I seem to have difficulty with is accidently touching the earbud and stopping the music. The other negative is there are 6 different size earbuds caps and I have to use the smallest pair so if I lose one or both I will have to replace them because I will have no appropriately sized earbud caps.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,1,0
"I've been on the search for a while now for a good pair of bluetooth earbuds and I've finally found them. Great sound quality, easy to use, functional, and an absolute wonderful price to complete the package. Overall, Tozo has done a wonderful job on these headphones. See below for further details:Sound Quality",5,1,2019-10-11,1,1,1
"These are really surprisingly great earbuds.  The case is solid, sound is great and controls are comprehensive and intuitive.  The case is very small so it fits easily even in small pockets but recharges the buds a few times before it needs to be charged.  The USB-C charges the case very quickly and there are 3 small LED's on the outside to let you know how much power is left in the case.  The magnets hold the buds in the case well but they're so smooth it can be tricky to get them out.The Bluetooth 5.0 connects quickly and easy and maintains connection even on the opposite side of my house on a different floor from my phone.  They're pretty light, considering the 6+hr playtime, but they still tend to feel like they're slipping out, and have fallen out a few times.  They come with 6 different sizes of silicone tips, plus the ones on the buds in the case.  They seamlessly connect and swap from single ear to dual ear mode and back and you can use either bud independently.  The call quality is great for people on both ends of the call.  People rarely seem to notice when I go from the phone to the buds.",5,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"I own the TOZO T10, and I can't say enough great things about them, but alas, I stupidly left one where the puppy could get it, and now I have one ear that still performs, but the 'button' no longer works (amazing that it didn't break).I probably should have bought another pair of the T10s, but the T6s had pretty amazing specs, so I took a chance.",3,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"I have previously owned  the Tozo T10 Bluetooth Earbuds. I was happy with those and decided to try these new Tozo T6 Earbuds . I like the new charging case. It is ""AirPod"" like in size and weight. They are more compact than those that came with the TOZO T10's but with. all the great wireless charging capabilities. The headphones  are IPX8 waterproof rated. This makes them great for me to use when I workout. They also feel a ""smidgen"" smaller than the T10's.They are easy to pair. Take them out of the charging case and they automatically connect to my phone. Put them. back in and they automatically disconnect. Nice and seamless. Battery life is great and they do charge pretty quickly.  Sound is decent. People are able to hear me properly when on a call.",4,1,2019-9-25,1,2,1
"These Tozo T6 earbuds represent the final step in my move away from wired earbuds.I'm a pretty dedicated exercise enthusiast, and it's important to have earbuds that fit well and deliver good sound.  My previous two earbud sets were a conventional wired one and, more recently a bluetooth set that had a wire between them that goes behind the neck.  While I love the bluetooth set with the wire, it ended up making me curious about a bluetooth set with no wires at all.  Enter the Tozo T6.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,1,0
"I've tried 3 or 4 different earbuds so far to find ones that are comfortable, have a reliable connection AND great sound.  These are OK, but I don't find them outstanding.  Particularly poor is the Bluetooth connection:  I un- and re-paired these four times to see if the issue resolved itself, but every time the connection is just OK, and only so long as the device (my phone in this case) remains VERY close to the buds.  Keeping the phone in my right hip pocket, I can still very reliably disturb the connection just by adjusting my right bra strap with my left hand.  Reliably.  Leaving the phone on my kitchen island, the connection is lost altogether after I walk 12 feet down the open hallway.  12 feet.  And during phone calls, it's not unusual to intermittently get a slight echo between the two buds; it comes and goes.  (My phone does not similarly lose Bluetooth connection to any of my other equipment including an Oontz speaker, Plantronics headset, and the little Dixie-Cup sized speaker I got years ago that still produces the best sound & bass-per-square-inch I every purchased.)**Update: seller replaced the item quickly, to address the problem. But the second pair behave the same way. The connection is just poor.",3,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"I've resisted purchasing bluetooth products for years, since I generally don't like dealing with pairing or recharging things. However, now that I work from home due to the pandemic, my cats harass me endlessly over my corded ear buds. Also, they get in the way when vacuuming, ironing, or washing my car. I decided to see what options exist that aren't $100+. These were the first highly-rated ones that popped up, and they seem to have great reviews. They aren't expensive so I just gambled on them.Out of the box, I was shocked at how small these are. The carrying case doubles as a charger, which I find very neat. The buds paired instantly with my iMac running MacOS Mojave. The signal carries quite far too, as I was hearing my Skype notifications a few rooms away. The construction seems to be very good.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,1
"Horrible. The people saying they’re good must have very low standards when it comes to sound and product quality. Yo put it simply, I very much regret purchasing these. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I attempt to use these, something goes wrong. I bought these 6 months ago, use them 2-3 times a week, and, without fail, something goes wrong. I have yet to have a smooth and/or seamless experience with these pieces of garbage.I keep them in their case to charge overnight, put them in for 2 minutes, and one of the sides starts to say ""Battery low"" and then shuts off 30 seconds later. This happens constantly. I put them in the case to charge, check on them a few minutes later, and one of them is no longer charging. Even when I notice that the red light is on, one side always seems to end up dying within 10-15 minutes, on a good day, within me taking them out of the case.",1,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
"I have always had problems with earbuds fitting in my ears. I can't use the solid plastic style ones (like apple airpods) because they just come loose and I always have to readjust and really ram them in there. So I typically use the kind with interchangeable rubber bits that go in your ears (like these ones). Anyway, I wanted true wireless earbuds in this style and I can say I'm completely happy with the fit. It's a little confusing which goes in which ear as they aren't your typical looking earbuds, but if you are taking them straight from the case and into your ears, it's not an issue. These earbuds stay perfectly snug in my ears and are light and comfortable and don't feel at all like they are coming loose. I'm very happy with them!As far as sound goes, I'm not an audiophile or anything but I think these sound very clear, and with a good fit in the ear, they are actually really good at blocking out external sound. I have a hard time hearing anyone speak to me even without the music on.",5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
"First out of the package, I notice the most gorgeous rose gold color on a sleek charging case. These earbuds are so beautiful that I want to put them on display so everybody will see them. They feel very substantial in that way that you love when you’ve spent a boatload on a luxury product. The only difference is that you didn’t spend a small fortune.You will rarely find this sort of quality for such an affordable price point. The earbuds came charged up and instantly connected to my phone. It was all very seamless and sort of dummy-proof if you have any experience with smartphones or Bluetooth devices at all. They came with several sizes of silicone tips so that your Tozo Wireless Earbuds will fit comfortably and securely in your ears. Also included was a quick start guide that explained how to use the touch panel on each earpiece to control your music, calls and device’s voice assistant completely from your wireless earbuds.",5,1,2020-8-2,1,0,1

"I am sad to have to return the TOZO earbuds, little case and separately, the wireless charging dock.  The TOZO T6 True Wireless Earbuds  is perfect for me except that I could not get them to reliably stay put in my ears regardless of the size of the earbud inserts. I discovered that my left and right ears are different and the most susceptible was the right but then the problem happened in the left. I ordered them both in black and Rose Gold in case the pink tone was too extreme. The Rose Gold would have been my choice since the color is similar to my own flesh tone,  is rather different and REALLY cute from a girly-girl-point-of-view.  I also figured it would be easier to locate the case  in a busy purse and busy life; confirmed by seeing them. What a great little case and system!But let's face it: what will happen is I will lose one and then the other as each falls out of my ear as I change positions during working-outs, and at a time when I am working very hard to get well-organized, all systems in place. So I have to let them go. Boo-Hoo. I hope they fit both of your ears and that you can enjoy them as I would have otherwise done!",5,1,2020-2-25,1,1,0
"I can testify that Tozo has amazingly responsive customer service and they stand by their product. We ordered the T6 earbuds which my 15 year old son reported had great sound, especially for the price. Unfortunately, one of the ear buds failed to sync and stopped working several months after purchase. We contacted Tozo customer service and after going through several troubleshooting steps unsuccessfully they immediately sent a replacement pair but upgraded u to the T10.Unfortunately, several months later one of the new earbuds again stopped working. I contacted customer service and after a few very reasonable steps they again sent us an entire new pair.  This may be the best customer service I have experienced for an electronic item. Our customer service representative, Hedy, was outstanding.

I do not expect these to sound as fabulous as my $130 headphones and neither should you.I'll start this review by providing information. This is an updated review after having written my original review. I was contacted after my initial review by the company stating that I may have received a defective model and was offered a replacement model at no cost.

"Seriously, I love these as much as my AirPods. In some regards I love them more. I basically keep 2 sets of devices - work and personal. My personal phone is an Android and my personal computers as HP. My work phone is an iPhone and I use an iPad when I see clients.They paired with both my personal phone and laptop/desktop as soon as I opened the case lid. I even tried them on my iPhone and iPad, and they paired just as quickly, and sounded perfect. Overall, they sound incredible, the call quality is not 100% perfect but well above average (I rarely have problems with others hearing on my end, and I never have problems hearing them), and they charge quickly on all my wireless bases. I am able to use them for Zoom calls and music on my PC with no issues. I never have a dropped connection or problems transitioning from one device to another. They've even allowed me to keep 1 earbud (AirPod) in my ear for work calls and another earbud (Tozo) in the other for personal calls/YouTube/music. I have even recommended these personally to my family and friends who don't have iPhone or don't want to pay AirPod prices. I definitely recommend these to anyone, and love them so much that when I misplaced them for more than a 1 week, I almost reordered a new pair to use while I waited to find my missing pair.",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"I've had these for 5 days and there is no sound coming from the left ear bud at all. It's not an issue of pairing, the earbuds think they are connected to each other and are definitely connected to my device. The touch controls work in the left ear bud even though there is no sound coming from it so it seems like a hardware issue to me. I have reset the earbuds several times and this has not fixed the issue.Even when they were working I tried to make a phone call at one point and the other person could not hear me at all.",1,1,2020-1-18,1,3,0
"I struggle with earbud/earpieces/headphones/etc. I have a very straight ear canal, and getting earbuds to stay in my ear is work. I've found earbuds that work, for a bit, then fall apart (then again, I don't spend a ridiculous amount of money). I did own a pair of Bose earbuds (gifted to me), but they also didn't stay in (waste of money!). As I like to wear earbuds when I exercise, I also had issues with using the wired Bluetooth earbuds that just wouldn't stay in. I bought a wired pair that was pretty bulky with all of the crap designed to help secure it in your ear, and nope, didn't do the trick. The better pair that I had been using were a bit older, but I keep them super clean and changed out the ear pieces to double flange, which helped. But they had the controller on the cable, so it would bounce around like mad when I ran. Grrrrr! I'm not a fan of the whole iPod type earbuds, they would NEVER work for me so I wouldn't go down that route (plus, I'm not an Apple guy, so there's that). Then I found these.I'm really, really amazed at how much I love these. They sound absolutely unbelievable (my old favorites, the controller-on-the-cable-bouncy ones had a lot of annoying midrange, hardly any clarity, but I dealt with it as they would *mostly* stay in my ears). The sound of these? Super balanced, not weird, and very dynamic and natural. I did change out the earbuds (to the larger size) and they form a really, really good seal. The first time I put them on, I put on some ambient music very quiet (my music at choice sometimes) and my wife was right next to me talking and I didn't even know it. That is worth the price alone.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"Before these I had the Bose sports earbuds and then the JayBird X3s. The battery on my Jaybirds is basically gone so I needed a new pair of workout bluetooth earbuds but don't have the cash to buy another $200 pair of premium ones. So after looking around abit I decided to try out the T6s, wasn't expecting much to be honest, but I was way wrong.To start off, the feel of these, and even the packaging they come in, is extremely premium. Worth way more than $30 to $40 price tag. The earbuds have a sleek glossy finish on the touch surfaces which is very visually appealing, and the case is minimalistic and really portable. The case is also wireless charging, which is great. I can just pop it on the same wireless charger my phone uses and it works fine.",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,1

If I jiggle it around on the charging pins I can occasionally get the indicator light to go solid red, but it never seems to charge.I tried the factory reset steps in the instructions but that didn't improve anything.

The rose gold color is also the cutest because I love anything and everything pink. The only thing I really wish there was, was cases for these specific earbuds since I know these are a bit bigger than the apple airpods.

I got really frustrated with the cord always catching on my hands when I was walking, and now that I'm sewing frequently (covid fabric face masks) I had a really hard time tolerating cheap headphones for hours at a time, and I couldn't play movies or videos loud enough to hear over the sewing machine, especially at night. It also meant I had to take the headphones out if I needed to move to grab things, because the cord isn't long enough to go around my sewing machine from my laptop and have pretty much any range of motion.The box these come in is surprisingly nice! It's a sliding box, so it's easy to open. I think I'm going to keep storing them in that box when I'm not using them for a while, so they're easier to find and protected. And the case itself is really nice, it's sturdy and doesn't feel cheap. I like that it's magnetized, so the earbuds easily click into place. It's a little hard to remove the first earbud, but the second comes out easier due to having a little extra space to get your fingers in the case.",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,1
"I've owned these for about 6 weeks and tested them at work, gym, home, and commuting. First issue, I have a pretty active roll at my factory job.  I sweat and move all day long lifting equipment working with water, steam, high humidity areas on top of sweating profusely. In regards to this type of setting, the earbuds do not stay in at all, does not matter the size of the rubber piece that fits in your ear I find myself constantly adjusting them. Second issue, after only 6 weeks of owning them the battery life has gone down to about every two hours I have to switch them out, and I only use one earbud at a time to either listen to music or podcasts at like medium volume, which that's a cool feature that you can listen to one at a time but hell after this short of time they only last about 2-3 hours each max. My third issue is the earbuds disconnect at least 4 times in an 6 hour time span then suddenly reconnects and you press the touch sensitive area and the music or whatever starts back again. Mildly inconvenient in the middle of a workout, call, video, song, or any time you don't want it to do that it seems they randomly disconnect then pair again. Last issue is today, the case is decent to house them but the hinge on the case to secure the bus in does not last long. It has become loose over the last two days and broke off today. Ordering a different pair maybe something more robust.Don't let this be too discouraging, if you need a decent pair of earbuds for whatever device that sounds good for the money, solid bass when positioned right, good treble and clarity on vocals in videos and music, inexpensive, than by all means they aren't bad. But only if you baby them and don't try to take them to work on any harder jobs where the case gets stress on it in your pocket or you sweat and have lots of steam and water around them then sure they should work great. If you need something a little more formidable look elsewhere.",3,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"I bought these strictly because I was looking for waterproof earbuds I could use while doing work near my pool (in case they fell out or got wet somehow). I found that if my fingers were wet at all (even slightly) I could not use the controls on the earbuds: could not pause, could not adjust volume, could not skip tracks. Earbuds worked fine with dry hands but if any water got on these then it was impossible to work the controls.The smooth buttons on the earbuds do not go well with damp fingers, it caused the volume to either go up all the way or go down all the way - even when I was just trying to switch tracks or pause the music. Only way to fix this was to completely dry off earbud and my hands, or put them back in the charging case and then take out again, so these didn't meet my needs.",2,1,2020-8-13,1,1,0
"Well, I'm the idiot who read the reviews about them breaking and decided to buy anyway. I used them for about two weeks, forgot about them, and then realized the left earbud won't connect or power on, no matter what I do. Because of the touch feature, there's no hard button to manually reset it, and I've tried the factory reset a few times now. The right one is fine.Before they broke, I'd say they were decent. The plastic part is large and I often was worried the weight of it would make it fall out of my ear. I wouldn't wear them running. They come with lots of different sizes for the inner ear part, but that doesn't offset how bulky the outer section is. Sound quality-wise, they were pretty good, and if you've got music playing they're certainly pretty noise cancelling. You won't drown out a conversation next to you, but you might miss a few words.",2,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
"When receiving any product, I am instantly drawn to the build quality. If it seems cheap or flimsy, I already know how the product will endure over time. Sometimes it is expected, I know when I try to save a buck it can not have a positive outcome. In the case of these earbuds, I opted for them after looking at the Bose buds, after reading reviews where the connection between the left and right buds would drop out all of the time I couldn't bring myself to spend over three times as much as this pair. So I opted for a cheaper solution to give it a go, as I don't even know if I will like wearing them all of the time. So needless to say, I was expecting a cheap build quality...That is not the case with these buds. As soon as I removed the charger I could feel the weight. Opening the top to expose where the buds are placed had such a quality feel you would think you were buying a much more expensive pair. The ear buds themselves seem to be built with the same care and quality, and dropping them into the charger you could hear a satisfying snap as they pulled in with the magnets to hold them securely. They instantly lit up red indicating charging so I was already feeling pretty good about this purchase.",5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"I fugured with 10k reviews at 4.5/5 stars, I couldn't go wrong with these.  Well, I did.  These are a good idea, but they didn't work for me.1.  The main reason I sent them back was because they literally kept falling out of my ears.  I wore them to mow the grass, and they wouldn't stay in for 45 seconds.  I used the biggest sized adapter and had them pushed in really well.  I can't believe others aren't having this problem.",2,1,2020-4-26,1,2,0

"Let me start that I already have wireless earbuds for daily use. I purchased this for two main reasons 1) Use for work (Daily usage ) and 2) backup in case I forget my main earbuds. I purchased these back in early February 2020. I work in the IT industry and need my equipment to work and be reliable, they have been great to link to my computer to conduct phone calls and Zoom meetings for my Job.The recent Covid Crisis has also proven their worth as I now use them quite longer than I was expecting to and more often than when I normally would in my normal office setting.",4,1,2020-5-21,1,0,1
"I've had these now for about a month so I thought I'd post an update.The design of these headphones is that they go in your ear (duh) and there's an additional piece that sits above your ear.

"Spent days reading reviews and trying to find a good budget wireless earbud (just bought a new phone and no headphone jack) I didnt care about looks, only how they sounded. These sound pretty damn nice for only spending around 47 with the coupon that was available at the time. For being a budget tws with a brand name I never heard of they seem to be built really nice. I'd definitely recommend buying these! Comes with a 1 year warranty through tozo as well which is a major plus.Update* Only issue i found is the case won't shut off the majority of the time. I have to fiddle with it to get the lights to actually go off(will run down the cases battery if leds are left on). Kinda a big deal seeing as the earbuds only get about 2.5hrs on time and if the case lights stayed on typically I get one charge out of it. So we're talking 5hrs total. Tozo did offer to refund 20% of the purchase price for the issue but we're talking like 8bucks So I didn't even bother. May end up returning if I find a better option. Still sound quality is very good!",2,1,2019-12-6,1,2,0
"I am a female in my mid twenties and I was not about to drop hundreds on stupid AirPods when the hype cams. I had stuck to my quality wired headphones until I recently felt myself being tugged around by my phone during home quarantine HIIT workouts(or phone dropping out of my workout pants pockets). Also got annoyed with being wired to my laptop while studying and leaning around to grab stuff/walking to printer.Luckily these affordable T4 headphones came along. Great noise cancelling(even with the sound on low),fantastic bass for workouts, and they don’t fall out!!",5,1,2020-9-28,1,0,0
"First off, these earbuds, for the price and for the features are pretty great at first. They have great qualities, intuitive features, and pretty impressive sound range that allows you to experience the best of what your devices equalizers can make of your music. Ordinarily I would highly recommend a product like this because of its comfortability, ease of use and affordability. Where this product falls short, and I really, really wanted to like these, is they do not hold a charge. Let me explain.The earbuds sit in a case that charges the earbuds which you then have to charge the case itself. However, in my experience, the earbuds WILL NOT charge themselves. If I use my earbuds for an hour or so and pop them in the case, their little red lights turn on indicating they are charging. Good, no problem. Now I’m dont for the day, I bring my case home and charge the case over night. The next morning I take my fully charged case and bids out, pop them in my ears and not 5 minutes later I get the “battery low” warning. They tell you, audibly, “battery low” every ten seconds or so until you put them back in the case to charge. So what I learned I have to do is BEFORE I plan on using them, not only do I need to make sure the case is charged, but I have to open the case, take out the earbuds then drop them back in to make them charge all over again which will of course drain the battery in the case. So for one day I may only get one use out of them altogether. Again, I really wanted to like these but the one function of a wireless earbuds I expect to work more than the actual Bluetooth connection is the flippin battery charging when it’s supposed to and then keeping that flippin charge at the very least over night.",5,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0
"I feel like I tried to do as much research as possible but sorry to say I feel a bit fooled by the amazing reviews these had.First and foremost, the touch controls are WAY too sensitive. There aren't any markings and even the slightest touch when innocently adjusting these in your ear sets off some control that you didn't wish for. The instruction booklet does explain how 1 touch represents x and 2 touches represent y but I don't know who could remember such a thing or NOT touch them at all.  The booklet also says that they will automatically sync to your phone just by removing them from the charging case which is not true. I had to turn them on and use the Bluetooth scanner on my phone to pair each time.",3,1,2020-9-7,1,1,0
"I'd been wanting to get a pair of relatively inexpensive (<$50) wireless earbuds for when I go running, as it's often boring to run without music and wired earbuds are a pain. After a lot of research, I settled on these, and couldn't be happier, especially with the additional 20% off coupon.First and most importantly, they sound great, with great but not overpowering bass and decent mid-range and treble (if just a tad too weak but that can't be helped with single driver buds in this price range), and ample volume (any louder and you'd be damaging your ears anyway).",5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"I found these by looking at other buds and it said there was a newer version. So I was like sure, let's try the newer ones so all the kinks will be worked out.The controls so far are super alien to me probably because of the size of my fingers, I've always had sausage fingers, but the control issue is just a learning thing and I'll get used to them eventually.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"I already own the Tozo T10s and so love the quality, clarity, and functionality of the earbuds....and then came along the T6s which are on par (or perhaps ever so slightly clearer) sound. I just wanted to have one pair for home use and one for my workouts which is why I decided to try these. I had ordered at least half a dozen other other earbuds in this rice range and I can say that I am very very picky with the quality of my music sound, and Tozos really hit the spot in terms of depth, clarity, and that thumpy bass that makes my music just perfect.....when I say ""thumpy"" I don't mean head exploding, but it is there and not muddy like the other earbuds I'd tried and subsequently returned.I love my Tozos and will be considering the NC9s just to try out their noise cancellation technology. The reason why I didn't go with these instead of the T6s is because I mostly listen to my ipod music when I'm relaxing or working out at home, working out around a park where it's already pretty quiet.",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"They fit fine and sounded acceptable but the left one stopped working within 6 weeks (just outside the return window with Amazon).  I figured that even if they only lasted a year it would be worth the savings in price but if they only last a month and a half, Just spend the money and get a more high end set.Update : I was not able to get a response to my attempts at warranty replacement on this item so I posted a 1 star review (above).  Subsequently, I was contacted and a replacement set of headphones was sent.  The replacement took some back and forth e-mailing and several weeks but I have received a replacement pair and they seem to work well.  The real question will be whether they last for longer than the first set did.  The battery life is about an hour and a half in my testing so far although I have only run them completely out one time.  So, if you need long battery life, certainly consider that. Overall, They have a 3 star rating until they last for longer than a month in my hands.",3,1,2020-3-30,1,1,0
"This is our third pair of Tozo headphones and once again they haven’t disappointed. The sound quality is excellent and I love that these are waterproof—a main selling point since I often wear headphones in the shower. I also like that you can control them via touch control instead of a button like on the T10 model, which is one feature I wished for when using the T10. The touch control does take some getting used to and maybe I’ll end up preferring the T10s physical button, but so far no issues.At the price point of these headphones you seriously can’t go wrong. Both my sister and my husband have a pair of these (T10 and T12) and love them. For me and my husband this is our go-to brand (we also have skull candies and a set of Bose headphones). The sound quality is not truly as good as the Bose but you can’t really expect them to be as good as a $300 pair. And I definitely don’t think Bose are giving you 10 times the quality at 10 times the price you pay. I’m a believer of the Tozo brand and will continue to recommend them to friends and family! They also have great customer service and really seem to care about their customer experience",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0

"Wow, just wow, I've only had these for one day, and I'm blown away by these. The clarity, the ease-of-use, and the clear middle ear affect they produce is phenomenal. The best part is the wireless charging, you literally feel like you're in the future when you can just set your earphones down on a wireless charge pad and a few hours later they're ready to go. The case itself feels smooth but not too slick to fall out of your hands too easily, its build quality is very enjoyable and feels strong 💪 without being metal. The earbuds themselves feel very comfortable and provide Crystal clear sound and nice bass, and block outside sounds like nobody's Business, and the buds can be used independently! The magnetic connection is strong when you placed them inside the case, maybe just a tad bit too strong, you really have to work them a little bit to pull them back out when securely locked in by the 🧲's. The standard ear cushions hold the buds securely in my ear canal. I am very impressed for the price point and the quality you're getting with these headphones.

"The main purpose that I purchased Bluetooth earbuds is for my motorcycle radar detector setup and that has been problematic.  The earbuds have been pretty good connected to my iPhone which is how most people are going to use them.  For my motorcycles I have a radar detector which I cannot hear go off with my helmet on so I have a Bluetooth transmitter plugged in to the 3.5mm audio jack of the radar detector then pair the transmitter to the earbuds.  On occasion this setup has worked well for long periods of time but othertimes the earbuds will not pair with the transmitter.  I have tried using 2 different transmitters, reset the transmitters and attempted to reset the earbuds.  The earbuds are supposed to flash purple after 2 taps in the reset sequence.  Mine do not.  TOZO has been very responsive to my emails and is sending a replacement however it is coming from china and will take at least 2-3 weeks to arrive.  In the meantime I am stuck using a wired headphone setup.  Not sure if I just got a bad unit or if there are issues pairing with transmitter for all units.  Most people will not have this problem.  The only other annoyance is that the sound easily cuts out if it is not in direct line of site with the source.

"These earbuds sound great. They have a very bright sound and great bass. I wanted the convenience of no wires but I like wired earbuds for no hassles. The paring process is a pain. I could not get them to disconnect from my IPAD. I had to turn off the bluetooth. I do have them paired with 3 devices. You have to connect or re-pair them and then disconnect them each time you are done. I totally hate the charging box. I have large fingers and have a hard time getting them out of the box. They do not have any active noise cancellation. You can hear other family members talking unless you really crank up the sound. The touch functions are nice but everytime you adjust them in your ear, you hit the controls. The controls are very sensitive. I took away one star from the rating because my first pair was defective. I wasted hours trying to get them to work properly.  All in all, they are a great sounding gadget.Update:  The seller contacted me based on my review and sent me a new pair of earbuds. It turns out that Amazon had replaced the defective earbuds with a box that was not shrink wrapped and that bothered me.  The seller sent a brand new shrink wrapped boxed pair.

I listen to streaming audio, audio books, and a LOT of phone calls. The presentation was 1st class like Apple, the units worked exactly as stated. Super easy to pair and I Love how they pair instantly when I wear them. Also the charger pod is nice and small and it keeps the buds charged. Impressive.

When I’m running I have my iphone and my Apple Watch on me and the ear buds still disconnect for a sec or cut in and out. That’s really my only issue with them. The battery life seems to be good, although they did just completely go out on me one time (after only 10min of use when i had them in the charging box which  had full battery life according to the lights). But mostly problem is staying connected via Bluetooth. They also fall out of my ears a lot if I’m running. I have to constantly adjusting. But when you touch them sometimes it’ll change the track on you. It’s almost like when I wanted to change the track or I want to pause, touch doesn’t work.

"I purchased the pink set. I have VERY small ears. The reason I did not already have earbuds is because the rubber pieces are too big - no matter how small they were. This package came with 6 pairs!  THE SECOND SMALLEST FIT COMFORTABLY WITHOUT FALLING OUT! The sound is AMAZING. They effectively cancel outside noise - maybe a little too well. But that has been a good thing during quarantine with these kids and hubby home all day. lol  I can listen to music for at least 2 hours with 2 bars left when placing back in the charging case - which is also very convenient! I've worn these in the shower and when doing my wet hair. My son purchased the T10s and he said mine are better. HA lol He also has small ears so his don't fit well and keep falling out. The controls on the buds work as described and that is very convenient as well. My other son has the Samsung buds we got him for Christmas, but for THIS price, these are a much better purchase of any of those overpriced, branded devices! As a sidenote, although purple is my favorite color, THE PINK IS SO CUTE! ;) I haven't used them for calls yet, but if that is a problem, I will update this review.

"I've had these headphones for a month now. They work fine when being still and most of the time walking. However, when I run with them the sound is constantly breaking up (I carry my phone in a thigh pocket). The sound breaks up sometimes when walking, but is usually fine when sitting. They are not sensitive enough to tell the difference between pause and skip, so I am constantly having my music and audio books skip forward when I want to pause.They also fall out all the time. And when I put them back in, it thinks I'm either skipping forward or pausing. It's super frustrating. I don't recommend these headphones.",3,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
"These are fine ear buds, especially for the price.  However the other reviewers who said they sound is as good as the Apple Airpods are just wrong.  Of course these Tozo's are 1/3 of the price.  I could have lived with the sound, but what I did not like was the noise cancellation - these buds fit super tight into you ears (any ear size -  as these include 5 different sized silicone ear canal sleeves to make sure of that).  I personally want to hear some of what is going on in the room I'm in  - for instance is someone speaks to me.  But these tozo's really block out the sound, due to how snug they fit.  If you want to block out external sound and only hear the music - these work well.  If you wanted to work out in them, I'm sure they would be great - better than Airpods, which can tend to fall out with big movements.  I did end up returning these but wanted to leave a favorable review because, even though they did not work for me, they are definitely worth the price if they work for you.  The device pairing and controls were excellent.",4,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"I bought these for wireless music when I walk.  I tend to skip a lot of songs, depending on my mood, and, unfortunately, the touch sensor is not as sensitive as I would like.  Usually, I have to hit it multiple times for fast-forward. One touch stops/starts, two touches forward/reverse, and three touches changes the volume.  It basically never reads three touches, so I have to change the volume on the actual device, which is not so easy when it's strapped in my arm band.  Also, it often doesn't register two touches (to forward) the first time. Instead, it stops playing (as if I only touched it once) and then I have to do it again.  If you skip several songs in a row, you can see how it is annoying.  I bought another set of ear buds right before this and I really like them, but they have an actual button you push vs the touch sensor. I paid more money for another pair specifically for touch, but it doesn't work as I would like.  My husband has the pamu slide, which is about $20 more expensive.  In hindsight, I would have spent more money and bought the pamu slide, it just works better. Overall, not worth the price.",2,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"First off, they sound great!~  Billie Eilish and TOOL never sounded so good.  Fitment is pretty good.  I think I have the right size earpieces on the buds.  There's NO notation of Left or Right.  I haven't read everything included as far as the books and instructions, but I'm assuming they're ambidextrous.  As far as sound quality, they rival my Bose over-ears, and produce more volume as well.So, the only reason I gave 4 stars and not a full 5 on everything, THEY ARE TOUCHY!  As soon as I had them paired, music was playing on my phone.  Whenever I try to adjust the ""fitment"" after putting them in my ears, I may skip forward, it may switch artists.  And honestly, when I try to use the controls, it doesn't do what I want, or expect?  With that said, they are great for noise cancellation, they are NOT too heavy and fall out of my ears.",4,1,2020-5-9,1,1,0
"As much as I wanted to love these I couldn't. I was super excited to get them and try them out. They were my first pair of wireless headphones and I was hoping they would work out. Sound wise they were great! When i wore both i couldn't really hear anything and the battery seemed great. The reason I am giving it 2 stars is because of the fit. They would not stay in my ears. I tried every single size and no matter what i did they kept falling out. I was really frustrated. I would try to push them into my ear ""deeper"" and they continued to fall out and they hurt my ears. additionally the actual thickness of the earbud seemed to be too large - they stuck out a lot and i think that's why they kept falling out. another thing i found to be annoying was the touch control. The only reason was probably because I was constantly touching them to try and keep them from falling out. If they had stayed in i think i would've really liked them. I returned them and now I'm looking at new ones- i hope i can find some that fit better.",2,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"While these headphones are fine there are a few minor yet very inconvenient details you should know before buying:1. They like to unlink for 5 seconds and reconnect randomly. This is the annoying thing about this product. I listen with a single ear bud for around four hours for work and it ""link lost"" at least once if not twice during that time. While it's only for a few seconds it's very irritating and should be noted.",3,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"DO NOT PURCHASE THESE! VERY OVERRATED FOR THE PRICE!!!!! These headphones are overrated. They're not loud enough and battery life is horrible. About 3.5 hours on a full charge and maybe 2 hours after recharging in charging case. The touch function on these are so annoying. Any little adjustment to the fit, which they don't fit very well in the ear no matter how you adjust ear bud fittings, and the touch function activates. Forget about getting sweat or water on these also, they are water proof, but any water on the touch function and its activates touch function i.e.: changes song, pauses, adjusts volume etc. ect.. The 'battery low' voice is also annoying because it keeps repeating over and over again. Battery life would probably last just a little longer if the warning didn't keep repeating. Also, the right ear bud always dies 30 minutes before the left one.  I do not recommend these earbids to anyone. The only thing they are good for is noise cancelation**UPDATE** the left ear bud doesn't charge anymore.. very disappointed.",1,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
Got these for my self. I wanted to buy Air Pods I have a iPhone so I am a huge Apple fan. Got some air pods for my daughter and TOZO T6 for my self which fit my budget better. After a week or so my daughter wanted to try mine so we switched. The TOZO T6 seemed to block out all noise so when wearing them I would seem/feel like I was yelling when talking with others. Once you put them on your going to know they are there more so than the air pod design. If you use the right size ear bud tips they stay secure. I realized why she wasn't happy with the air pods after using them. I initiated a return through AMAZOM on them. AMAZON was very understanding and issued a refund with no hassle. Great customer service AMAZON A+++PROS:,5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"I’m one of the people who held onto my iPhone with a headphone jack until I couldn’t. Then I used a Belkin converter - all because my first experience with Bluetooth headphones was terrible. Should have tried these a long time ago - as I’m thrilled with them!These earbuds are more than I expected and everything you’ll want. Super easy to pair them. The sound is great and they do block out quite a bit of background noise - to give you an idea, I can tell my husband is speaking to me, but have no idea what has been said. They hold a long charge and you can charge the case with or without a wire. And I’m sorry to say, I’ve dropped a bud a few times and they survived beautifully.",5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"Updated Review (May 26, 2020):I have been using these earbuds all day, daily, for months now, and I'm so impressed. First of all, I think that the battery life is way better than advertised. I keep them at a low (healthy) volume and they last me all day, sometimes longer. I charge the case every few days. If I'm driving and use just one earbud, then I can switch back and forth to let one charge while using the other and I get days worth of use.",5,1,2020-2-12,1,1,0
"I have owned two pair of sound peats and I liked them. Both pairs met their end because one bud eventually would not pair (9-12 no after purchase) even after the manufacturer instructions. This go round i decided to try the tozo. I like the form factor of the earbuds better. It uses a touch support instead of a button so the surface is more slick and can be a little harder to get settled in my ear and if I have to adjust more likely to pause music than with the sound peats but once you do get them settled, seems better about staying in place. I like the form factor or the case better as it is easier to stuff in my pocket and like that it has a lid. Even though sound peats have magnets I have occasionally dislodged an earbud in a crowded pocket. I think the sound is a little better than soundpeat but I'm not an audiophile. The mic seems better. I was never able to use soundpeat for a call everyone always complained. So far these have been good. I don't use it for that much but if I'm listening to something and a call comes in it is the easiest thing to do and it seems to be working. I use a pro headset with boom for woek/planned calls. Only had a month, so not sure about long term durability but figured couldn't be worse than the soundpeats. Glad I went with these this time so far.",4,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
"Updates:These buds are now completely unusable as when they're in my ear, the right bud thinks I am constantly turning the volume up, when I am not even touching it with my finger. Cannot stop it so they are unusable. Per original review, if they actually were stable the sound was quite good. Off to find a 4th brand that might hopefully work with Garmin Fenix 6. C'mon Garmin, please certify some modern ear buds!!",1,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
I bought these headphones to replace my apple airpods which had gone through the wash....twice. They actually survived but the volume output on them was extremely low and hard to hear when I wasn't somewhere that was dead quiet. I needed something to replace them but wasn't willing to shell out that kind of cash again.I read a lot of reviews for headphones and settled on these. I'm not dissapointed. I like the headphones overall but they could certainly be improved with a few small features.,3,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"This is the third set of these that I’ve owned.  It's thru no fault to them - I keep losing them!!  I go back to these every time because of their reliability.  The battery life is great, the sound is great and I love doing business with them.  A while back I had an issue with the charging container, I called them and I had a new one within the week - no questions asked.  I highly recommend them.  I’m on the road a lot and I like the idea of being able to use a single pod at a time.  It took me a little time to get use to the touch control on these but their instructions are great.I would like to add a bit more to my review:  after a meeting I removed my plugs from my ears and put them In my pocket loose.  Later that day I removed one from the pocket to use when I changed clothes and was walking out the door - long story short, I lost one and put the other one some where not paying attention.  I did laundry the following day and guess what?  They showed up in the dryer lint!!!  Happy to have found them but sad because I was sure that after going thru the wash and dryer that I was doomed!  But!!! Lo and behold!  They work just fine!  Do I love these???!!!  You betcha!!!  Buy them!",5,1,2020-6-7,1,1,0
"Updated Review: I would not buy these again. I had a factory flaw with one earbud.  It was significantly quieter than the other even at max volume.  The company customer service was very responsive, and fixed the problem for me. HOWEVER, they requested a 5 star review before they would send the replacement.  Hello, Customer Service Bribery.Even then, they ""forgot"" to send my replacement earbud.  I had to contact them a couple more times regarding it.",1,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
"These wireless earbuds are absolutely fantastic! They come with 6 different silicone earpieces to ensure a comfortable and proper fit.I love that the storage case also acts as a charger - super convenient, since I have a habit of forgetting to charge my items. The case is also slim, compact and cute and durable. I really like that the inside of the case is magnetic - the earbuds go in right and secure and I’m not worried about them falling out.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
"This is the best wireless buds I have ever used.  You get a water proof, wireless charging bluetooth 5.0 ear buds for half the price of airpods or galaxy buds.Sound",5,1,2019-10-26,1,0,1
So far the T6’s have paired easily & quickly. The bass is very pronounced but does not muddy the mids and highs. The case is quite compact and solid-feeling. Have not had it long enough to comment on battery life or call quality. Seems to fit well in ears and are fairly small and comfortable . Initial impression is very positive especially for the sale price. Update: Sound remains great with my using the XL ear tip. I have noticed if I twist the earbuds to far around in my ear the touch sensitive surface will maintain contact with my ear causing the volume to continue increasing so I just have to watch out for that. The other odd thing I realized is that the way the buds and case are designed the buds go in and out of their “slots” upside down from how they are worn in the ears. In other words you have to rotate each one when putting them back in the case. Just a minor inconvenience and I like the compactness of the case. These really sound great if you like strong but not overpowering bass!,5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,1
"Got a great feeling about these earbuds the moment I pulled the box out if the Amazon package. Beautifully boxed, they give the impression of costing well over $100. At half that price I have to say, these aren't cheap, and they definitely do not feel or sound cheap at all. The music is crisp, with base that is deep and treble that is sharp without hurting your ears. The max volume stops just at that threshold where you could hurt your ears, but since they do such a great job of blocking all external sound, it almost feels like you wouldn't want to make them louder. I guess if I need to complain about something it's that they lack the option to make my ears bleed. I snapped my fingers next to my ear and could not hear it with them on at full blast.The range is what should be expected from Bluetooth, so as soon as you get a wall or two in between the headphones and their source, you will lose connection, but that should be expected. The microphone in these things is crazy sensitive too. Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but it does not filter out background noise and instead brings it front and center.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"Normally I dont write a review until I get a request from Amazon, however this is one time I'm doing without a request.I have never thought of purchasing ear buds until I saw the T6 wireless. I am truly amazed by the quality and performance of the Tozo T6. The ones that come with iPhone I have never been able to keep them in for any length of time cause they keep falling out. With these ear buds there is no way they are coming out and with the additional  ear adapter I now have a set that will stay in no-matter what I am doing. I was just flabbergasted of how quick they paired with my iPhone and with the voice alert that let me know what my volume level was. There are so many fascinating things about these ear buds. They fit In my ear and are comfortable to wear. When I received them there was enough power to test the volume and quality of sound. The magnetic connecters inside the case for charging are awesome and when you place the ear buds inside to charge you know they are connected because you hear them snap in. With these ear buds I can now listen to You Tube and anything else without disturbing anyone else around me. The case they come in is small enough to put in my pocket and not disturb me while I'm sitting down driving. The quality of sound is great and I dont have to worry about a noisy environment cause I can still hear very clearly what I'm listening too. With other ear phones I've tried I had to press a button to activate them however the T6 that are touch or should I say swipe your finger across, just amazing. Now when I take off my sun glasses I dont have to worry about the ear phone coming out any more. I haven't taken time yet to time the recharge rate but I'm almost sure with all the other good qualities that will be just as great. Oh boy did I forget to mention that the case they came in is also the charger for the ear buds. Also while they are charging you can see the state of charge because at the bottom of the case are small lights that show the amount of charge. I would recommend the Tozo T6 to anyone.",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"My Apple EarPods starting to lose the charge quickly, I’ve had them a few years so I wanted to merging affordable and with good quality.

They were delivered quickly, are simple to use, come beautifully packaged, have multiple rubber cover options and a charging cord. They look well made and feel good in the ear, I like the way the disappear into the ear versus hanging like pods. Good sound quality for what I need and was able to take calls on them without issue. I was skeptical but I’m happy with the purchase!",5,1,2020-9-27,1,1,1
"I recently bought TOZO T6 True Wireless Stereo Headphones. I already have ""TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds with 【Wireless Charging Case】 IPX8 Waterproof TWS Stereo Headphones"" and this new upgraded TOZO T6 is little bit more compact than the older one. I like the charging case which is very sleek and easy to slip into the pockets to carry. Only thing which kind of bothers me is the touch sensor which pauses/plays the music even when I try to adjust the earbuds to snug in properly while using. May be need more practice in handling it. Other than that, the sound quality is awesome.",4,1,2019-10-10,1,2,0
"I waited until I had good opportunity to give these a good test before reviewing. I wore these for a couple of hours last night listening to all kinds of music. They were very comfortable. They stay in your ear well. I shook my head, jumped, and they stayed put. Once you get the hang of the tap controls it is great. You can raise or lower volume, go forward or back on your music app. It tells you if you are connected or not. It tells you a phone call is coming in and more. I haven't tested the mic yet but other reviews were positive. The sound quality is really good. I am a musician / music buff and picky about sound. I guess a $150 - $200 set might have better sound quality, but these a really good for the money. The sound is well balanced. Good mids, decent bass and highs/ A little lacking on the highs, and if you are looking for sub woofer bass these won't give it to you. However, overall they sound really good. The Bluetooth range is very good also. A good 35 - 40 feet. Oh ya they a re waterproof too. Can't beat these for the money.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"I'm listening to Spotify with these ear buds as I'm typing this, and the sound quality is pretty impressive.! I'm no audiophile, but I was a little spoiled having come from using Bose headphones.  Truth be told, I was only looking for super compact ear buds that sound decent and don't cut out during my workouts.  I wasn't minding spending a good amount either, as I love music and figured this would be a good investment for me.  Having read a ton of reviews on higher-end brands, I decided to go with the TOZO T6 buds because the reviews seemed to be consistently good.Shipping was super fast, packaging was nice... and so. many. ear bud attachments to choose from to custom fit your ears!  I ended up choosing the middle pair for my smaller ears.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.. the buds are compact, super lightweight and comfortable.  There is no budge with a ton of head movement, the buttons are just sensitive enough for the different functions.  The volume up/down requires a 3-sec touch to adjust which may be a minor inconvenience in the middle of a workout, but I intend on just using my actual phone for a quick volume adjust.  I have yet to attest to any waterproof or battery life comments, as I only just received them.  Hope this helps!",5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,1
"Okay, So.... I was pretty pleased at first. Like it's cheap and they work pretty well for the price. I was excited! One day, I noticed on of the earpieces wasn't producing sound.

"These are absolutely game-changing. My first set of Bluetooth headphones were a pair of over-the-ear kind, and I really loved the freedom of no cords. But the bulkiness quickly became a noticeable annoyance: can't wear a hood, can't take off a sweater without taking off the headphones, can't do a workout that involves too much dynamic movement or they'll fall off (and eventually break like mine did several times), and you can't transport them easily when you're not wearing them.But I don't want to shell out tons of money just to flex on people with Airpods. I listen to a lot of music, so I want good quality sound, noise cancellation, and comfort. These provide all of those things, and the price is amazing. I love the little charging case, and each of the war buds clicks itself magnetically into place in a very satisfying way, and the case itself clicks shut in an equally satisfying way. The lights on the case tell you how low the charge is, which is something my other headphones never did - it was either fully charged or not. The ear buds are comfy and easy to put in once you get the twist technique down.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"Second set of off-brand earbuds, and this time have not been disappointed.  Mainly purchased  for night time plex watching when the family is asleep, and syncs with my q80 perfectly.  Automatically reconnects when put in ears, and sounds has been phenomenal.  Obviously your not getting apple air-pods battery life or brand name, but for 30-40$, you really cant find a better choice for Bluetooth earbuds.  Started wearing while mowing the lawn and just about completely sound-blocking as well, which is a huge plus.  Who knows the durability and longevity of tozo products, but with kids and an active lifestyle, buying a few pairs of these is a much smarter life choice than one pair of airpods, esp when they sound fantastic.  Perfect complement to 4k movies",5,1,2020-9-2,1,1,0
"Latest Update 4.21.20:  The new earbuds work perfectly.  I am thrilled that Tozo reached out to me proactively and made this right.  What a great company and a great product.  The buds sound and fit great.  They are very close in sound quality to my Jabra Elite 65T.  I find myself using these buds more frequently than the Jabra because they are weatherproof and fit more comfortably.  I do wish it that Tozo had an accompanying app like the Jabra to tweak the audio levels, but once you find the right sized ear piece that fits snugly in your ear, the sound quality is a wonderfully balanced.  I have no complaints.Update 4.15.20:  The buds continue to sound great but still intermittently drop out.  The company proactively reached out to me and will send me a replacement!  Hopefully it will work as I expect it to.  We will keep this review updated as we go.  Thank you, Tozo!",5,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
"UPDATE: after using the earbuds for a month I wanted to update my original review and add a star. These are fantastic for the money, the bass is actually not bad, but they do lack a little in the mid to highs, but not enough to take away that last star. Oh, they also taught me that my left ear is smaller than my right ear. It kept falling out but I was able to change the ear tip and wala, perfect fit!If your looking for the reason for my 4 Star rating then please go to Sound Quality below.

Honest review. I was going to give these a four star at first. But after using them a little a little bit I changed my mine.Here are some of my favorite features.,2,1,2019-11-26,1,2,0
"Wow these are awesome!!! I have ordered and tried 3 other earbuds and non of them have these features. Real touch smart (no button just touch the earbud touch area). Some ads say touch smart but they have a physical button to push. They connect fast and are consistently connected, I have not had either eat cut out as I did with the other ones. Wireless charging, wow. Just everything about these earbuds are top notch. I can’t believe I paid $50 for these, they are worth twice that. I tried the T10s which were great but had the physical button. Major improvement by Tozo. Excellent, inexpensive, high quality sound (for me anyway). Buy these earbuds!!!",5,1,2020-4-24,1,1,0
"I ordered these after reading the reviews.  What caught my attention on them was that they were waterproof and came with various ear pieces to help with a good fit.  I have never had any Airpods but my kids told me they looked just like them - only these weren't $300.When I received them, the case was already charged. I pulled them out and they easily paired with my phone.  I tried all of the ear pieces and finally figured out the smallest size was the best size for me.  When I get into my car, my phone will still connect to my car and I forget that I have the ear bud in my ear until I hear it say ""power off"".  I like that these will turn off automatically when they aren't being used.  I like that they will charge in the case and I can take one bud out at a time.  Each bud will last about 3 hours of non stop use.  When the battery dies on one, I just drop it into the case to charge, take out the other one and pick up where I left off (I use these to listen to music on my phone when I am working).  So I have a wireless headset in my right ear that is connected to my work computer and allows me to answer my phone and then these wireless earbuds in my left ear to listen to music.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"Update: The charging case stopped charging the right bud but the left side is still operational. To charge both just swap them around. It is annoying but still under, warranty so that should be covered. I would still recommend this product.For the price I paid, I am pleasantly surprised. Sometimes I wish they had more bass. Other times I wish the max volume was louder. My last wireless Bluetooth headset had terrible range and I was expecting the same or wide with these. I forgot my phone in my work truck during a call and I think I was 40-50 feet away before they started cutting out. I wear them when mowing without issue. My last headset cut out all the time when I kept my phone in my pocket and I ended up having to mow with a wired set; not with these! Not yet! I do wish I could could hang up after a phone call, unless I'm missing some piece to the puzzle... And I'm not crazy about the touch only, I feel like physical buttons would cut down on fat fingering when trying to play/pause or skip ahead/back.",5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"These are my first pair of wireless headphones. During quarantine I've started DMing a game of DND with friends, and the over-the-ear headphones I usually wear become uncomfortable over my glasses after a few hours, meaning I needed to branch out into something more comfortable for extended wear, so true wireless it is. So far the sound quality is pretty good, there's a tiny bit of tininess in the treble, but the bass is better than I expected. The battery life is a little shorter than I would have liked, but the headphones themselves do recharge pretty rapidly. The packaging is very nice, and it comes with several alternate sets of ear tips (it took a bit of adjusting to find the most comfortable size for me) but they sit securely inside the ear (I did a thorough shake test that I'm sure my family appreciated). The overall design of the charging case does feel to be a very blatant replica of the classic AirPods case, but it serves its function well.My biggest grievance with these is the sensitivity of the touch controls. Brushing my hair out of my face or adjusting my glasses, even a delicate brush across their surface activates them. Though some may consider this a plus, it can be a bit irritating at times as someone with longer hair, plus pressing down on the surface of the earphone to utilize touch controls jostles the ear uncomfortably, so I feel I will not be using touch controls without manually removing the piece from my ear, which defeats the purpose. Additionally, the lack of a companion application to adjust the headphones settings is disappointing, but not unexpected for the price point.",4,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"When I got these headphones, I charged them up, and they did pair easy with my phone, but that's where the ease stopped.  The instructions on how to insert the headphones is vague, so I just twist until they feel comfortable.  When you take the headphones out of the case, they automatically come on; however, you have to be very careful about putting them into your ears, as it's easy to touch the sensor face and mess things up.  But that's not what is frustrating.  I studied the instructions in detail and was able to make the headphones operate as instructed.  Unfortunately, they don't do well on the fly.  When I'm outside working and listening to music, it's rare I could make the headphones do what I wanted.  The instructions say I can tap either headphone to forward or reverse songs, increase or decrease volume, and even make phone calls, etc.  The problem is, most of the time I couldn't get the headphone functions to work properly and had to go to my phone in order to make adjustments.  Furthermore, these do work themselves out of the ear, so I'm constantly having to re-insert.  Volume is good, but not as loud as I would like, and it's okay at keeping outside noise to a minimum.  I haven't used these enough to know how well the battery holds up, but not sure I want to continue using them to test the battery's mettle. All in all, I'm pretty disappointed, but will continue to get what use I can until I get too frustrated and throw them away.  Will continue my search for a better set of headphones. Overall, I would not recommend.",3,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
Much better then the T10s because I appreciate the touch control. I have bought and returned so many earbuds because they just dont cut it. These are awesome they stay in my ears they connect well and so far I haven't had any issues. I wish the charge case was a c charger and had a longer batter life but I accept all of that with the ability to make GREAT PHONE CALLS. That's right if you need these for calls. These are the ones. Nobody ever had an issue with hearing me or vice versa. Awesome Job Tozo.UPDATE:  So I have tried these out and I still stand by the fact that they are great for calls. I have even went as far as to mow my lawn and the caller could clearly hear me as well as vice versa.  Like these are legit for calls if you need that.,3,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"These are the first wireless earbuds I’ve used so wasn’t sure what to expect.Pros: I like that the package comes with 6 different size ear buds.

I also love that they turn on as soon as you put them in your ears. Not sure how it does that but very cool.",4,1,2020-9-4,1,0,1
"These work really well, but should not be considered a well-refined product. Although, for $40, you could do way worse.The most important thing to me: I have very large ear holes and using the largest rubbers, these stay put and never feel like they are going to fall out.

"Final Update: Don’t buy. 😔 These earbuds seemed to be perfect in the beginning, but in less than 3 months, they are dead. RIP, T6 buddies.I loved these earbuds so much when I started using them. They paired up right away and the sound was excellent. Three weeks later, the volume dropped down to a level one. I can barely hear anything. Tech support could only send me a link to the company. I’m heartbroken. I had recommended these earbuds to my closest peeps. Now I feel awful about doing so. They’re practically dead, and the next pair I bought from a different company doesn’t compare to the sound that these buds used to produce.",1,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
I just got these today and so far I’m impressed.  I had AirPods.  I loved my airpods until they got stolen out of my bag.  I have been a huge supporter in Apple but after they refused to see the design flaw in the airpods “tracking ability” that it 100% wiped all tracking from your phone if the person spends the 10 seconds it takes to synch them to their phone before you notice they are missing.  The phone acts like the airpods never existed and you can’t even track back to the last location that they were before being synched to another’s phone. Apple’s customer service actually disconnected me when I questioned this.  I decided to get airpods thinking the extra security of being able to track them made them work the cost.So I refuse to purchase another overpriced Apple product when other companies are just as good with 1/4 of the price tag.,5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0

"Very good budget Bluetooth ear buds. The sound is pretty solid and gets better if you're proficient at adjusting your device's audio equalizer. These aren't as crisp or rich as high end earbuds but still very good. Excellent for walking around campus or out running errands.Mine do try to slip out a few times a day, so they are not ideal for workouts. I have tried all of the ear tip sizes that came with it and no luck getting them to stay put for anything larger than a mild head jostle.",4,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"I read many reviews of these earbuds before purchasing, but I was skeptical that they would be as good as I had hoped. I decided to give them a shot, since they were far more inexpensive than the well-known brand name sport earbuds. I LOVE the way they fit in my ears; they stay in place. They are sweat proof, as they claim, and very comfortable. They connect automatically to my phone when I take them out of the case, which I love. The sound is much better than I expected. The bass could be deeper, but the overall sound quality is excellent, and the volume range is great; some of the wireless earbuds I have tried in the past did not play loudly enough for me. It is very convenient to be able to charge these in the rechargeable case, and the case itself is small but offers ample protection. I bought these after Thanksgiving, as they were on sale, but the regular price is worth it. I am very pleased with these earbuds so far. I have run on the treadmill with them, and it is important to me to not have to worry about constantly adjusting my earbuds, and I do not have to do that with these. Lastly, these earbuds block out all background noise, and I enjoy the touch-sensitive volume, pause, and track selection feature. I actually bought a pair for my father for Christmas, and he is happy with them as well.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"I did a ton of research before buying a pair of wireless earbuds. I finally found that the tozo t6 earphones are the best true wireless earphones in the opinion of the internet and people who know what they're talking about.I  received them very quickly and I have to say I completely agree with the 5 star reviews, these earbuds are amazing!",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"When I first put these in my ears, I was very excited how good they sounded! then I started walking around and the sound cut out a couple times. Then I put my phone in my pocket and the sound continuously cut out. I tried disconnecting them from my phone and reconnecting them as was recommended by customer service but it did not help. I sat in one place for about 15-20 minutes with the phone right next to me and the ear buds cut out at least 3 times per song. And that was when I was not moving! so for me these are pretty useless.. I need to be able to put my phone in my pocket and walk around. 2 stars for good sound. Amazon had great customer service to help me through the decision to try another brand or try these again.UPDATE: It may just be the phone I was trying to use them for. I tried to connect my airpods (that work perfectly with my iphone) to the same phone and they did the same thing. Possibly no ear buds will work for the samsung A6.. I will keep searching though. These ones have great sound, just cut out with my phone, especially when I place my phone in my pocket.",3,1,2019-11-11,1,1,0

"At first, I was extremely disappointed in the response of these earbuds.  I initially went with the supplied earcups already installed.  If there is one thing that the engineering and the broadcast/electronics industries has taught me, it is to never be satisfied with performance right out of the gate.  The highs were piercing, midrange lacking, and lows, if heard, were muddy and undefined.That changed abruptly, for the better, with a simple walk in the winter snow.  I donned a tight-fitting knit cap, which pushed the earbuds ever so slightly further into my canals, for a tighter fit.  The lows appeared, the midrange made its presence known, and the highs became tolerable instantly.",4,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"I've been thinking about getting wireless earbuds for a while but the price point was beyond justification. Amazon had the Tozo T10s for $39 but then I saw the next model, the T6, was being released as just $10 more. Why not give them a try?The build is sold. The sound is great - if you use the right fitting rubber tips. The T6 comes with five sets of tips in various sizes. Right now I'm trying the largest size. The bass and passive noise cancellation are good.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0

"My sister had purchased these earbuds and was using them while speaking with me. She had previously purchased another pair of earbuds and the sound quality was horrible so she returned them. With these earbuds, I was able to hear her clearly, in fact, she had put her phone down and went to the upper level of her home and I was able to hear everything. That goes to show you the quality of the earbuds based on the distance from her phone. That convinced me to purchase the earbuds for my own use. I have had the earbuds for a day and so far, it works great. I was playing spotify through the earbuds and the sound quality is one of the best I've had in all of the earbuds and headphones I have ever used. While speaking to my cousin she too was amazed of the sound quality and purchased a pair herself.I rarely write reviews, but wanted to provide an honest feedback to help anyone who is on the fence. Again, I've only used the earbuds for a day but am very happy with the purchase especially at the price. I never used Apple airpods since I use Android, but I definitely feel this is probably better bang for your buck.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"Fantastic sound quality, and the material design of the buds are really beautiful and tasteful. The touch controls on them are a great function, and at this price, the cost of this upgrade compared to other affordable, popular buds was somehow accomplished at low rate.I hadn't ever tried ear buds until my husband got a pair..I tried them out and then had to have a pair. His doesn't.have any of the touch features (I think they both may have the built in microphone), his is completely black plastic with a matte finish (these ear.budd are shiny and sleek), and these buds only cost $10 than his.",4,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0

"These are my favorites of a number of bluetooth earbuds I've tried, including Air Pods, and I would typically never have trusted a headphone made by a brand I've never heard of. Right before these I'd tried the Sony WF-1000XM3 which didn't sound as good to me mainly because they didn't fit my ears as well as these. But the case for the Sony's actually felt much cheaper than these.These buds are surprisingly well designed, the case is nice and compact, and sound quality is much better than I'd expected. Great clarity, and well balanced.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
I took a chance on these after lazily looking for Bluetooth earbuds for my OnePlus 7t pro McLaren 5g thingymajig. Phone companies need to stop these long names.Anyway I took a chance on these and I couldn't be any happier. Automatically turning off when you put them in the case and the opposite when you take them out is amazing. Coming from always having regular earbuds and in ear monitors. What's even better is you can connect them mono or stereo. Now at my job I drive a forklift but I am super lucky my bosses don't care about music on the lifts. So I only listen out of one ear and I'm sure I'm probably the small minority of use cases since most people will use both at once. I'm not sure about the longevity of EACH ear bud in testing applications but in my experience I am able to get through 6 hours of my shift with 60% on one earbud left. I take a little break after my lunch to cool my ear off and clean off the sweat. I just continue with the opposite ear for the rest of my shift. The charge case only uses 1/4 of it's charge in a single day.,5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"I've tried several sets of off-brand wireless earbuds. None has been impressive but these were the worst value by far. The sound is unremarkable, though not notably worse than other brands. I don't know what it is about earbuds that they can't produce bass tones.Battery life was unimpressive. The case doesn't appear to provide much of a reserve. I much prefer earbuds with clickable switch controls instead of touch sensitive controls. Any time I adjust the fit of the earbuds they pause the playback.",2,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
I was a little skeptical about these earbuds. My son had a pair of T10's that were stolen from him at school. He had saved up his birthday and chore money to purchase them. He loved them and was heartbroken when they were stolen. He constantly bragged about them which encouraged me to try to get a pair for myself. I saw the T6 were available so decided to get a pair. So far I am impressed with the sound quality. Music sounds wonderful so much so that I have given him my wired pair to him.Bluetooth pairing was a breeze and using an android device I was very easily able to upgrade the firmware as some other reviews had indicated. I wore them at work today and actually had to pull one out a little to hear my phone ring as they did a pretty good job at blocking out the ambient noise.,5,1,2020-5-15,1,0,1
"I thought the t10s were great, But these are just on a whole other level. The case is super small and the earbuds themselves fit in my ear PERFECTLY. The battery life has improved from the t10. The connection is super seamless it connects to my phone within 5 seconds and you can only use on if you want to and even switch between them seamlessly. And the touch controlls... are there and they work that's all that matters. These are easily the best earbuds I've ever had. And I love that it wirelessly charges. They are only worse in 1 way and that is they have less base than the t-10 which is fine for people who havent had the t-10 but I'm just going to have to get used to less base. 100% worth $50(FIXED)Update: I just switched to iPhone and they don’t work with it. I tried every solution and nothing. And I’ve tried on multiple iPhones and it seems to be the new ones they don’t like.",5,1,2019-10-5,1,0,1
"The setup and pairing of these earbuds were a breeze. I easily figured it out and got them up and roaring.I’m impressed with the sound quality. I’m not a musician nor an expert with audio.

"These ear buds do everything the manufacturer says they will and they do it very well. Outstanding bang for your buck. They sound fantastic. Solid bass, clear highs and plenty loud. Fit is great with a choice of 4 sizes of cushion ear pieces. Batteries last 5 hours and recharge in under 45 minutes. Bluetooth voice announces when batteries are about to run out. Water proof case has wireless recharging which I use and recharges in under 30 minutes. Four tiny LEDs indicate charge level and charging progress. Nice! You can recharge the ear buds at least 3 times on one full case charge. Even though they're specifically designed for cell phone use, I use them primarily with my laptop. I have used them with my Samsung S9 though and they work perfectly with it.  Touch controls work as documented. Bluetooth ""voice"" announcements are a female British voice which I find amusing. LULZ It announces the left and right ear buds as primary and secondary instead of left and right though. As others have stated here in their reviews, they are a little difficult to remove from the case. I have long slender fingers and it's a little difficult even for me.  But a minor issue since they sound and work so well. I would definitely buy these again and would recommend them to family and friends.",5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"I was expecting average earbuds for the money but I got more than I expected! The sound quality is outstanding for how small these are and they are packed with features found in earbuds costing 3 times as much. I love the touch control features which are very responsive. The wireless charging capability of the charging case is just icing on the cake. The case is a lot smaller than I thought it would be also making it easy to carry in a pocket. I haven't had time to test how long the charge lasts but will update my review if I find a problem later. There is an app on their website to update the firmware of the earbuds. I think it fixes problems with Apple IOs which didn't apply to me but I did it anyway. I tested the Bluetooth reception on my new Samsung S20 Ultra which is Bluetooth version 5.0, and was able to leave my phone downstairs and go approximately 60 ft. away upstairs before it started losing connection.

"No earbuds (wireless or not) are going to sound great. Even the ""high end"" ones sound very mediocre, and that's being polite. There just isn't enough room for quality speakers. That being said, these sound fine. They aren't gonna blow your mind, but they shouldn't let you down if your expectations are realistic. They could be a touch louder, but the volume is sufficient to practically mute traffic and pedestrian noise.Build quality is pretty good. Better than it should be for the asking price. The touch functions work well (not perfectly, but well) even in humid or sweaty conditions. The wind doesn't effect the touch controls, and they look pretty cool.

"Really wanted to get the Airpods pro but couldn’t spend the Money. I own the first gen but they were useless while cutting grass. These Tozos are amazing. The biggest difference is the ability to seat them in your ear creating better bass response and noise isolation.  They sound great. Bass is awesome. Cut out my snow thrower noise significantly. Nothing out there is worth spending more $$ on. I can buy 6 pairs of these for the price of one AirPod Pro.  Save your money. These are great. UPDATE...... So I just had to get the AirPod pros to settle things. I reviewed them already. I have to say. I’m sticking to my story about the Tozo. Even though the airpods active noice canceling worked fine, not enough to spend and extra $200. These Tozos are truly amazing for the money. Better base, better water resistant, fits snugger, and much cheaper. They may not be as loud as the airpods but save your hearing. I kept switching between the two for a half hr. Making all kinds of noise.... I couldn’t  tell much of a difference between active and passive noise canceling. I don’t know where some of these people come up with their ratings. I’ve been an audiophile for a long time. These really great airbuds..",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0

The touch controls are also smooth and work well, maybe a half second to full second delay between tapping the earbuds and the device responding.

"I like the sound, the case that they recharge in and basically everything about these earbuds.  I love the fact that they charge as they are in the case, this has always been my dislike for wireless headphones. But these things are slick, they do not have rubber around them and when you pull them out, they can go flying. This has happened to me several times, once while we were landing in an airplane and one of the ear pieces went flying. Thankfully as we deplaned, a couple of other passengers helped me look and one of them found it several rows up.",4,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
"I love the sound of these inexpensive buds. As long as you have them seated correctly - I give them about a 1/8 twist to make sure they're screwed in tightly - the highs are are clear and the bass is plentiful. I've noticed that over time they tend to work there way out a little and I have to give another twist to seat them properly once again. I do have an issue with the ""buttonless"" controls. The earbuds themselves are touch-sensitive for controls such as pause, answer phone, etc. It's almost impossible for me to do anything without activating some command that I didn't mean to. Every time I take them out, put them in, adjust them, and so on, I'm either skipping to the next track or pausing or something else unintentional. I find it far better to have an actual tactile button rather than the touch-sensitive earbud for this reason. I would actually give these 4.5 stars if I could, but since they're not a 5, I'm going with 4.",4,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0

Maybe I do not know what I’m doing, but they are very sensitive to my touch.  I have to be extremely careful when adjusting the buds in my ear so I don’t accidentally hit pause or flip songs.  Also, like all other earbuds, they fall out of my ear when I run.  Based on the reviews, I had hoped these would be different.  They’re not.  Doesn’t matter what size bud I put on.  I bought another pair of off-brand buds that clip around my ears for running.  The sound of the other buds are not as good as these, but I only use them for running.

I could feel the low bass notes that I haven't really heard in other earbuds I've had since I lost one of my T10's.  The controls are really intuitive too.

"These are an awesome substitute if you are not willing to buy AirPods which I was not. These sound quality is not as great as some reviews might suggest, they are not as good as AirPods and because they are Bluetooth that will reduces quality as well. However they do sound very good and they do block out a lot of outside noise. They stay in very well while working out and walking around. The tap controls are great I love how easy it is to use however if you are adjusting them in your ears you will likely accidentally pause the music. The microphone on these is great.

"I've been looking for a decent pair of wireless buds for the past 3 months since my previous set finally went kaput.  Unfortunately, the old model I had aren't sold anymore, so here we are.  I've tried a couple different pair since that point, and fitment wasn't awesome.  I pretty much exclusively use these for working out and traveling, so comfort is important.  I recently found myself on a 6 hr trip (flying), and thought it'd be a good chance to test out the longevity.  Before we get to that, a little about the buds....I'm very impressed with these earbuds.  I previously had issues with getting other buds to sit in my ear canals correctly, as all of the rubber tips were too big.  Most come with 3 tips, but these come with 4, and the smallest set fit perfectly.  I have no problems with them coming out during my workout routine, which is something I experienced with the other pairs I tried.  They do a fair job of canceling a lot of extraneous noise, which is good.  With a perfect seal, they can cancel all of it, but that's the case with most in-the-ear types anyway.  Bass is reproduced nicely, and the music is crisp.  They pair as soon as they come out of the case, and I enjoy the fact that you can use either one w/out using the other.  The case is held closed with magnetic force, and it feels substantially weighty in your hand, not cheap.  It's a very nice package.  On to the information about longevity....",5,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"I have only had these for one day, so some other issues may crop up. First, these have a little too much bass for my tastes, but otherwise sound great. Noise blocking is fantastic...maybe a little too good to use at work. So far they have stayed in my ears without falling out, which was a big concern for me. I do have three issues that immediately came up. I pulled out my phone only to find that the blue tooth was connected, even though the buds were in the charge case. That could definitely cause problems. Another issue is when I received a call (or text) the music I was listening to paused, but there was no sound telling me what was going on. Finally, when I did finally connect a call, the other person could barely hear me. That is an issue I have with ALL bluetooth devices, so no surprise there. All in all, though, a great value. I own four sets of bluetooth devices. These are my only truly wireless, and they sound the best of all of them. Definitely recommend them at this juncture!",4,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0

Secondly, whenever I touched the earbuds to pause, it would immediately play it again without me touching it the second time to activate it. Basically, it won't stay pause for more than a few seconds, I tried to find a direction to change the setting cause I thought it might be adjustable but I couldn't find any.  The last thing, it keeps falling off my ear. Just a little nudge without touching it already fell off to the ground.Changing the buds might help but we'll see. The one that I'm using right now is the one that came with the earphones and it starting to hurt my left ear, which leads me to headache.",3,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"Cons:Don't expect to make a phone call and change the volume at the same time, because the same motion (press and hold on either earbud) is used for volume up/down, and end call. You would have to use the phone itself to adjust all volume during a call.",2,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"I've been using these headphones for a couple days, and am impressed. They have excellent sound quality & have a sleek design. I like the touch-sensitive controls (no mechanical buttons.) Various functions, such as on/off, play/pause, forward/reverse, & volume are selected by combinations of short & long taps. The controls are quite sensitive, so it took a while to get familiar with how to touch the units without accidentally activating one of the controls (the secret is to handle them by the sides to adjust their position in your ears.) After initial pairing, they connect to my phone immediately upon removing them from their case. If they both don't turn on immediately, you can just touch the one that is off to turn it on & it will connect automatically. There are 4 different sizes of rubber sleeves included, so it is easy to get a really good fit for the size of your ear canal. My ear canals are on the small side, so this is an important point for me.It's a little difficult to get them out of the case, since they are all smooth edges & it can sometimes be a challenge to get a grip on them against the magnetic force that attaches the contact points. My only other complaint is that the ""R"" & ""L"" indicator on each ear bud is hard to see (especially in dim light.)",5,1,2019-9-25,1,0,1
"I am not a headphone professional, my most used pair before these were 9.99 from Target. But they got the job done, I got the new Galaxy 20+ and was faced with needing wireless earbuds or the dreaded dongle thing. I went earbuds, but unwilling to shell out $100+ since I am good at losing things like this. I will say I have tried other knock off brands before for wireless headphones, and was never happy (battery life, charging issues, connectivity issues, bad microphone... ect) these are the opposite of those experiences. I got the Tozo wireless charging pad to make charging even easier, they connect together and separately to my phone so quick and easy. Phone calls are clear and consistent on both ends. The touch features are cool and easy to use. The quality is probably better than any headphones I've ever owned (which, may not be saying much givin my target go to's, lol, but really, the quality on these is really nice). They stay in my ears really securely, and have yet to irritate or hurt my ears like some brands have. I'm really genuinely happy with these! And the charher, but I'll leave a separate review about that!",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"(Since I've seen this mentioned in other reviews - I have not been paid by the manufacturer, offered anything for a review, etc. This is my honest review, based on my purchase.)I've been wanting a pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds for quite a while now, but have been reluctant to spend a lot of money on them for fear it would he a waste. I was particularly concerned with the sound quality, as I am a bit of an earbud snob. (I LOVE my SkullCandys!) But, due to using public transportation often recently, I finally decided to take the plunge and give a pair a whirl.",5,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0
I was looking for wireless earbuds for school and for when I'm cleaning around the house or going for walks. I have small ears so it's difficult to find earbuds or headphones that don't make my ears hurt. These not only fit snuggly they also don't hurty ears at all. They were easy to pair and I love that they turn on and connect automatically. The sound is nice and the noise cancelation is pretty good. I can't attest to the battery life as I just got them but I will update once I have a chance to see how it is. Overal these are great and you can't beat the price. I will repurchase when the time comes. These would make a great gift as well. Very happy I purchased them.,5,1,2020-1-31,1,1,0
"I love the compact form factor of the buds themselves and the charging case. The look and feel of the T6 and case have a definite coolness factor. Bluetooth connection is easy and reliable. The touch controls are easy to use. Playing time is long, but I have not timed it. The case provides numerous charges to the buds before itself needing to be charged. None of what I listed so far matters if the sound is not great. I am happy to report the sound is excellent! I struggled to get a good fit with the T6 though. That's not necessarily a criticism of the T6. Everyone's ears are different, and probably T6 fits most people fine. I'm mentioning the fit issue because as most of you know, fit is critical for getting the intended performance from your ear buds. Proper fit will take your sound from 4 stars to 5 stars. The tips that finally gave me a good seal and secure fit were memory foam ones from Ebay. I have 5 pairs of TWS earbuds, and Tozo T6 is my current favorite.",5,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
Received these as a gift from TOZO after I purchased their T10 earbuds for an honest review.So here are the good and the bad:,4,1,2019-10-14,1,0,1
"I wanted to like these.  Based on other reviews I thought they’d be perfect. The first pair arrived broken, I gave it another shot and asked for a replacement, which was sent out before I even sent the first ones back. The second set worked, then sound quit about a week and only a handful of uses later. Sending them back for a refund.***update***",4,1,2020-3-15,1,1,0
"I really like the charging case these come with. It can recharge the buds a couple time before it needs recharged as well. By that time you are talking about hours of continuous playing. The case charges pretty quickly too, making these really efficient.My only complaint is the when they made the whole bud a touch pad, it becomes hard to adjust or remove/replace a bud without it pausing or skipping your music. A minor complaint though because these are pretty comfortable. I don't think they'd stay in place during high level activity though. Even when they are perfectly in place, I don't think I could run or jump around much before they moved.",4,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"I’m a caregiver who works night shift in a small geriatric facility so being quiet is a must. I really like that I can put one bud in and leave the other one charging! I didn’t anticipate that so I’m grateful! I can’t speak for the noise cancelling as I haven’t used them in a setting where I’d want to block out noise. So far the charge has lasted longer than I expected it to, and it charged fairly quickly! It came with a warranty on the packaging and also with a large variety of ear squishies (idk the name for them), I genuinely prefer these over my AirPods since they’re more comfortable and stay in easier. OH! Also, I left them in my car during the day (whoops) and where I’m at it is very hot and my car had to have been well over 100 Fahrenheit for several hours and it didn’t seem to effect them at all. Obviously not a good thing to make a habit of, but it’s good to know that it didn’t kill em the first time haha!",5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"I've always been pretty cheap, needing only the basics but I finally decided I wanted a true wireless headphone. After reading reviews about both the Tozo T6 and Tozo T10 I choose the T6s. I like the style, color and case. I am particular fond of the sound quality and notice the noise cancellation when I'm biking around town. I have not tried them on a plane yet. The touch sensitivity to increase/decrease sound and change songs works well. The headphones stay in my ear really well (different sizes available depending on your ear canal size). I was kind of nervous about them staying in my ear because, at first glace, they look pretty big and kind of bulgy but they fit nicely in my ear and stay there! Charges quick and stays charged for a long time. I love the presentation and the box they came in. You can tell that care was taken when they were packaged and sent. I would recommend this product and have not had any issues.",5,1,2020-3-24,1,1,0
"I bought these to compare the 2019 Galaxy Buds  and so far they've held their own. Its a great pair of true wireless buds for the price and the case is definitely the style that everyone is after, which is a plus. The case has a nice weight to it, great sound qyality, and the T6 fits in the ear snugly, with the touch sensitivity being just right. Since each earbud is independent, you can use either or; they can also be switched from ear to ear so they don't even have to be left or right (which I consider a plus).  The case charges quickly, going from 20-30% - 2 lights (the light indicator is great) to 100% in about 25 minutes wired charging. Only downside is that the wireless charging has to be on a flat surface and can't be used with my standing wireless charger for my phone.I've seen a lot of the reviews on here look incredibly paid for but these earbuds are actually pretty dope. I was going to return either these or the galaxy buds but I might just keep both of them",5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"I haven’t fully tested out the earbuds yet, but tried them out on a quick walk with the pup.They were super easy to pair, and the instructions on how to use the touch controls were simple. It was easy to pick up... just took me a few tries to get the volume controls to work.",4,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
Packaging:-Nice and sleek.  Not hard to open,5,1,2020-1-17,1,1,0
"As the owner of the TOZO T10 earbuds I give these a rating of 5 stars as well (with a couple of qualifications). The sound quality is as good or better. I love the the addition controls for forward/backward/pause, etc. They work great in the shower. I have not, and do not intend to test them fully submerged, and in swimming. The last thing I'll note is the smaller form factor -- and the following is positive rather than negative). I love it but there was something comforting about having the lanyard and the earbuds hanging around my neck. I find myself frequently checking my pocket to make sure they are still there as they are comfortably small and do not add a noticeable bulge or weight on my pocket.If I could take off a half-star it would be for little things such as: The difficulty of removing the earbuds from the case. The T10 is so much easier. I'd also ding the T6 for the touch sensitivity, which I also love. You must take extreme care and make sure to grip the extreme edges of the earbuds when adjusting the T6 in your ears while listening to music/podcast/call as you may unintentionally hang up/skip forward or backwards, or pause your program.  These things were not enough to lower my score to a four-star, just something to be aware of.",5,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"I read 100 reviews on this item. I also compared to other like items having the same technology and just went for it. They pair very easily, can be used independently or as a pair. Using one limits functionality but which ones really don’t that aren’t $200-$300. I got these for about $32 on a flash sale. So far? Worth every penny. I’ll update the review after a full 30-Day trial run.",5,1,2020-7-26,1,2,0
"Do not get these headphones if you get outer ear infections. I used these just a few times and started to notice that I was having problems with my ears. It would clear up when I stopped using the headphones. Since I still was not sure why I was having problems I tried using them again. I wore them for only an hour and of course, the ear infection came right back. My ears would itch. I would try to relieve that and next thing you know, fluid coming out of the ears. Which is gross. Sorry.This type of headphone can cause outer ear infections. If you sweat while working out wearing these, that sweat can run into your ears and become trapped by the headphones. That bacteria from your sweat will also get on the headphones. Even if you wear them when you are not working out, that bacteria is already there, meaning here comes that infection again.",3,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"First I like these ear buds overall. I use them mostly for long hands fee phone conversations with long distance friends & family. I have on occasion used them to listen to music and they sound great.For reasons I have not figured out, I have a hard time switching the pairing from one device to another. If it's paired to my laptop and I want to make a call with my cellphone I have a difficult time disconnecting it from the laptop & connecting to the cellphone. Also the rubber tab that covers the the charging port on the charging station is difficult to open especially for me as I have a dupuytrense disease in my hands so anyone with arthritis would have the same problems. This also makes it difficult for me to remove the earbuds from the charging station. I believe overall this is a good product & for healthy people that are more tech adaptable will not have these issues especially for the price being under $50.",4,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"I want to preface this with this is the first wireless earbuds I’ve ever bought. Overall they are great. I wish there was more functionality, but from what I found, you have to spend at least 2 or 3 times for that I.e. instant recognition, an app for usage, other misc things.Pros:",4,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
"I originally bought a pair of the TOZO T-10 earbuds and liked them a lot.  Both my wife and I have hearing problems, but with different types of problems.  I mainly used the T-10s to listen to my TV through it's bluetooth capability to assist my hearing, which it did fabulously.  But if she wanted to use the earbuds, it was actually too loud for her one good ear. Her other ear can hear no sound.  The answer is this new T6 model.  It has the ability to adjust the volume just by touching the earbud.  You can adjust the T10 through a smartphone's volume controls, but not the TV.  On the T6 touching the right one increases the volume, and touching the left one decreases the volume.  I also like that the T6 is a little smaller and fits the ear very well.  Both models come with 3 different size tips for your preference.  Both models are waterproof and work throughout our small home.  The specs say they have about a 30 foot range.  I can listen to an evening of TV so I am pleased with the battery life and like the wireless charging as I can use my phone's charger for another use.  I am not really sure what noise cancellation is, but I don't hear any unwanted background noise, so I gave that rating 5 stars too.  Both units do an excellent job of playing the music on my phone.  The T6 are just better because they are a little smaller and have the adjustable volume feature.  I use both sets and like them both, but my wife prefers the T6.",5,1,2019-10-25,1,0,1
"I just received my T6 earbuds from Amazon Prime, and I am very pleasantly surprised. I could tell as soon as I removed them from the sleeve of the box that they were made in a quality fashion. The plastic is smooth and glossy on top and matte finish on the sides. The latex earpiece is the perfect size for my ear which normally is smaller than normal. I have no fit issues whatsoever. this is honestly the first time this has ever happened in my four attempts to find earbuds. The quality of the case that they charge in is exceptionally good. The feel of the lid when you open and close it gives the appearance of good craftsmanship. I think it is great that it can charge either by USB directly as in my picture, or that it can charge wirelessly. The only thing I am missing is a wireless charger. To top it all off, as soon as I inserted the earbuds into the case and then removed them, they instantly paired with each other and started looking for my phone. I searched for new devices in my phone, found them, and set up could not have been easier. Immediately I started listening to music in my Google play account. I was blown away by the quality of the sound as well as the way the noise canceling of the earbuds work. I honestly cannot testify about the battery life just yet, but I am very hopeful because of the quality I have seen in every other aspect of this product. For the price, I do not think this product can be beaten. If you are in the market for Bluetooth noise canceling waterproof earbuds, definitely give these a shot. I have not immersed these in water yet, and I do not intend to intentionally. However, I will have no reservations whatsoever about using these when I go for a jog and it is raining. This is especially important because using these combined with a weatherproof smart watch that has storage for music makes it an ideal choice for a no worry configuration.",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,1
"Great for phone calls. I use them for my work answering calls all day. Charge holds fine.Noise cancellation: if complete oxygen cut off in your ear counts as noise cancellation, you got it boss. They can really get uncomfortable over a long time. This could be on me, because i havent messed with the other ear fitting things.",3,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"So, I bought these super excited.  Waterproof - Yeah!  Don't Fall Out of Your Ear - Meh.... Charging - Here's the weirdness I don't like (some might not be worried but, my OCD kicks in pretty heavy).  So, you plug them in.  The lights will just light (there are 4) when they are full.  No green, no blue... no nothing to show that it is fully charged.  I used the cable.  Unplug it, plug it back in, it starts to cycle again, like it's charging.  The last light - on, off, on, off, on, off... nothing to show full charge.  So I went to my trusty charging matt.  Samsung, has worked beautifully.  Red light (means charging) - cool right?  Wrong.  Next morning, red light.  My matt has lights that will change to green when an item is fully charged.I get that it's not a big deal to most but, I have to know my stuff is fully charged.  Just a peeve.  Bothers me.",2,1,2020-10-4,1,0,0
"These are some great earbuds for the price. I had bought the t10 model, an although I liked them, they were pretty basic with only being able to play/pause music, and the charging case would drain its own battery if left sitting off the charger. These are definitely an improvement, where you can play/pause, turn the volume up an down, skip and go back to previous songs. Makes it where you only have to turn the music on from your phone, an then do the rest from the buds. The case is also much slimmer making it more comfortable to carry in the pocket. Like the previous model, they come with multiple size buds so you can pick the ones most comfortable to you, and they fit so nice that they wont fall out of you ear. The only thing i can say that im not a huge fan of is the touch feature, an thats only because i wear these when im at work an i dont really want to touch them with greasy hands an i have a hard time getting my knuckle to register to the touchpad, while the previous model i could use my knuckle to press an pause them. However, i know that this wont apply to many people, so thats definitely more of a personal critic than anything. Most of you probably wont have an issue with it. Overall, great earbuds an would definitely recommend trying them before spending $100+ on the big name brand ones.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"These earbuds are the best pair I have ever owned. I've had wired and wireless earbuds, but none of them have held a candle to these. TOZO is exactly as advertised, something you don't find very often in sold-online products. I was wary of the description. I thought, ""No way are these actually waterproof, noise-canceling, and they have long battery life? That just doesn't happen!"" Boy, was I WRONG!The first thing I did was try the waterproof function. As you may well know, many products advertised as waterproof online turn out to be more water-resistant. Not so with TOZO earbuds! The first day I had them, I wore them in the shower, convinced that I was going to be risking $40, but at least if I messed them up immediately, I could probably get my money back or even a new pair since I had a warranty. THEY. WERE. AMAZING. I could hear the music perfectly! They worked just as well after the shower as they had before! (Granted, the one problem I had was that sometimes they would kind of fall out of my ears a little but honestly, it's just cause I have really small ears. XD)",5,1,2020-9-4,1,1,0
"I gambled on these as I knew I couldn't run races much longer with my Sennheiser over the ear wireless headphones. Also, I'm pretty easily disappointed by chronic earfit problems from headphones.

"This is my first pair of wireless headphones. I'm pleased with them. I bought them because of one specific review from a mom that bought them for her son. They work perfectly with my Pixel 2.The biggest problem I have is that when I readjust them I keep touching the outside of them, which results in an operation activating. It's frustrating since it affects the podcast I'm listening to by going back to the beginning or going to the next one mostly. But I'm learning to adjust by touching the outside of them and soon I will do that automatically. Also, I think I do that not out of necessity but more out of habit.",4,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0
"Had high hope for this, but it is highly inconsistent. While it has great sound and the microphone is great during calls, it constantly unpairs and then has problems being paired again. You have to get the docking shell and set them back in and start over. Super inconvenient. You will hear “link lost” a lot. Not sure if this is because I have an iPhone or not.On the plus side these fit my ears and stay in longer than anything else I’ve had that was similar. When they are working correctly, it’s the best experience.",3,1,2020-8-17,1,1,0
"Pros: Amazing quality, deep base, great fit in-ear even during active movements. Six different size era pieces to choose from.Cons: Some things to consider...they stick out and do not fit well under a motorcycle helmet without causing pain, or hurt if falling asleep and have one side against pillow. They are hard to adjust or reinsert (push in for adjustment) without pausing music or causing something to happen (touch function very sensitive) and there is little to grip them with for readjustments.",4,1,2020-7-26,1,1,0

"I run a lot and my old pair of headphones finally died. Most headphones do not fit in my ear like normal and it is very difficult for me to find a pair of wireless ones that won't fall out while running or that I have to adjust every five minutes during the run. Since my average run is 10 miles I want to be able to go and not think about my headphones. These actually fit the best out of any pair that I have tried. I would give them a five stars for that. The one thing that made these headphones not useable was the fact that it is impossible to turn them on or off with any consistency. Since there is no dedicated button you have to hit them just right and at just the right spot and then hope they respond in the way you intended. With all other headphones when I hit the mile marker then the music/audio book pauses and then resumes after the announcement. These would pause, but they wouldn't restart. So every mile I had to try and hit the things in the right place to get them going again...which was difficult to do (without sometimes skipping ahead or going backwards and then having to take my phone out to get back to where I needed to be). I would advise getting a pair like Phaiser Fusion One. While they didn't fit as nicely, they stay in and they have a single button. They will also start back after the announcement every single mile.",2,1,2020-10-3,1,0,0
"Wow.  Wow.  I did not realize how bad I ""needed"" BT earbuds until the COVID and I started riding my bicycle everyday.  I happened to have some promotional products earbuds that I started to use but the left and right buds could not stay connected to each other.  So, in frustration I sprang for the $150 for the LG air bud thinking at their posted MSRP $199 these have to be great, right?  Not so JOE!  As you can discern in the photo, the LG buds are on the left.  Theirs are meant to just sort of hang in your inner ear lobe but not into your ear canal.  Thus, you shake your head and they fall out.  Also, can you believe this?  Their buds do not connect to anything but smartphones.  Total  engineering fail.  So, in frustration I found these with over 11,000 reviews and figured I had nothing to lose at that price.  Wow.  They fit so perfectly, sound great and they even come with a comprehensive manual.

"Original (4 stars): So I fully intend to update this review because I’ve only just received these and haven’t used on a run yet. But I’m pleased with how small and unobtrusive these are, and particularly pleased that they fit well! As someone who’s only ever liked how Apple earbuds fit (I’ve never had or tried on AirPods-I’ve accepted that I lose everything and can’t have nice things), I’m hopeful about these. I had to change the earbud fit to the smallest size (apparently I also have small ear canals?) but after that, they fit really well!I’ll be using these on some runs this week and will update how the battery life, sound, and fit are after that!

Easiest to set up and amazing sound!! These wireless earbuds Actually stay in my ears as I have always struggled with this. I really am so happy that I didn’t spent tons of money on the other well known brands that are out there! I chose the color white for mine which comes with the charging case as well! I love listening to music 🎶 and a lot of my friends who are recording artists and musicians have also been very impressed with these great earbuds !! For being my 1st experience with wireless these are the best investment I have made !! Make sure you get yours today and you won’t be sorry!!

Get more bang for your buck right here with these !!,5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,1
"These are very high value / performance Bluetooth  earbuds. Color me impressed.  For the price these are just an incredible value.  Sound is rich and clear.  Wireless performance is impressive - best I've experienced of any bluetooth product I have owned.  I bought these, this is not a paid endorsement, you can't lose these are just a really nice pair that exceeded my expectations for something in this price range.  I use them for outdoor exercise  and while working around the house.  Quality of sound is excellent - I listen mostly to Instrumental music, Jazz and classical. If you are a bass hound look elsewhere.  These are well balanced and accurate. Pay attention of how to insert these into your ears getting a good fit - once they are properly placed you will be quite happy with what you hear.  The case with inductive charging is very convenient and not found in products in this price range.  What can I say - I'm quite happy to use for my everyday set of earbuds that offer a lot for the price.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0

"PROs: These headphones are great.  They sound amazing with a good bass boost, they don't feel cheap and are affordable. They're lightweight, small and fit in your ear well without falling out.  I love the design,  simple sleek and not covered in logos ,other patterns or any symbols. The case in nice and small and not to mention, along with the earbuds, its waterproof. Battery life so far is great too. And soo easy to pair!CONs: My biggest complaint is that they cut in and out often if im walking with it in my front or back pocket. I've tried it with an iphone and samsung galaxy and it does it for both.  But it has never cut out any other time,  i can be on the other side of my house than my phone and the connection is perfect four rooms away. Or i have my phone on my desk at work and walk all around the office without it cutting out. But as soon as i start walking with my phone in my pocket, 2 feet away, it cuts in and out every couple min and at times much more often, it never completely loses connection though.

I heavily relied on the existing ratings which numbered in the several thousands to determine that I wanted to purchase these earbuds.My only gripe is that when you put the earbuds in it creates pressure in the inner ear that quickly becomes uncomfortable and needs to be readjusted. Personally, I think that these would be best for casual listening as they have trouble staying in my ear and routinely fall out under light activity so these probably won't stay in super great while running or training. Perhaps one of the other 5 pairs of ear bud covers that come with it may serve better to keep the earbuds in your ear.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"This is my first set of wireless ear buds so the only thing i can compare them to is wired ones. B6 far, these are the most comfortable. They sound great, pair easily.

"Ordered these earbuds as a replacement for the Samsung Galaxy earbuds I lost during moving. Everything I needed came in the box. (Earbuds, case, charging cable, selection of earplugs, 18 month warranty, instruction card and manual) The earbuds were partially charged. I took about 30 minutes to fully charge earbuds in the case with supplied charging cable. Once I turned each earbud on (They function as separate Main and secondary devices) Pairing was simple and easy. Sound is very good. They fit securely and are extremely comfortable. If they last for the 18 months it will be the best $40 I ever spent.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
The T-6 is a great alternative to Apple’s overpriced AirPods. These definitely give you the bang for your buck.Pros:,5,1,2020-1-25,1,1,0
"I have used these wireless ear buds on a limited basis so far but I am really pleased with the overall sound and particularly the bass that usually is lacking in some similar priced products. I tried my kids Apple air pods and do net believe they provide as much bass. The fit seems to be a little more tight than air pods which I can not say is more comfortable or not due to limited use of both. For the cost of these I do suggest giving them a try. I am unsure how to address the noise canceling claim but I know I cannot hear anyone talking to me when I am listening to music. If my opinion changes after further use I will add to my review.UPDATE: Now that I have used these ear buds longer I want to say the only negative is that when I sweat due to physical activity such as working out or mowing the lawn, I have to reposition or push ear buds back into my ears due to them slipping out or coming loose. They have not fallen out but they seem to become loose. I will still say the sound is great in my opinion. No matter if I listen to Dave Mathews or Led Zepplin, always great sound.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
Going on my 3rd set in 1 month.  The Positive: LOVE the sound quality. Amazing battery life! This is what keeps bringing me back to give it another try.First set: The left earbud would not hold charge as long as the right so it would cut off (SIGNIFICANTLY early) as in a good hour or so before the right which was annoying.,4,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0
"I really like these wireless earbuds and they work great with my iPhone 11. The mic is really sensitive and picks up wind & road sounds on phone calls if I'm going against the wind. I like the volume controls but it took a little to get used to. The case charges quickly on a wireless charger, I've not used the cord. The case stays charged for quite a while and will recharge the earbuds at least 4 times without recharging. Being a sweaty kind of guy, I also appreciate the water resistance. I've actually rinsed off my head (accidentally) under the sink without any issues.I've used them whilst weedwacking, both with and without over the ear protection. With the double layer, it's a little disconcerting that I can't hear ANYTHING but what's coming through the earbuds.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"Yes they can go in the shower and they will still function later, however, every time the water touches them, it pauses the music. Also any time you may need to readjust them or take them out of your ear or brush hair out of your face you will pause or skip of just disrupt what you're listening to.They only work together. You cannot connect them separately. You can charge one and listen with the other, but that one you're listening with does not have the same functionality as with both.",3,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"I just received these earbuds and so far I am very happy with my purchase. I’ve been wanting to purchase a pair of AirPod pros but just couldn’t spend the money. I had an Amazon gift card and heard good things about these earbuds so decided it was worth a try. I am so glad that I did!!!! They have great sound quality, fit nicely and the functions were super easy to learn. They also offer and extended 18 month warranty if you register the product. The packaging they came in is very nice and they have several size options for the earbud covers. Since I just received them I’m not sure how the battery life will be so I gave 5 stars and will adjust later if necessary. I only gave 3 stars for noise cancelling because they do not offer noise cancellation, however they don’t advertise that they are either so that was not a disappointment for me, most earbuds are not  and if they are, they are much more expensive. Super excited about this purchase!",5,1,2020-6-29,1,0,1
"Bought for husband. They quit working before he got barely 3 months normal use out of them. Doubt seriously either vendor nor Amazon will provide a refund.UPDATE: Seller contacted me regarding my negative review of this product.  They offered and I accepted a full refund for this ""disposable "" set of wireless earbuds. I believe that as a buyer it is a reasonable expectation to get more than 90 days/3 months use of even a low budget set of earbuds in this price range.  Because the seller took the initiative to offer a full refund I am upgrading my initial one star review to a 3 star review.",3,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
"I’ve had these earbuds for over a month now, and they are fantastic for the price. The only nit-picking I have is that they are twice as large as the Rowkin buds I have, and they will randomly drop the connection and quickly reconnect about once in a two hour window; that appears not to be related to movement or activity level. These were minor cons, and similar to many other <$50 BT earbuds, so I was fine with that. The sound quality is better than others in the price range I’ve tried. A big win with the T6 is that when using both earbuds at once, I have never experienced a connection problem between the buds. Other brands near this price point always seem to drop one ear’s sound, or both, even when sitting still. The T6 never have this problem, even when I’m working out. Battery live is also better than others in this class, as my earbuds routinely last over 3 hours of steady use. The case charges fast on a good Qi charger, no problems there. I was very pleased with the quality for the price.",5,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"These are so much better than other wireless headphones out there. These headphones pair to each other so your phone needs to discover one bluetooth device instead of two like other earbuds, which means NO DELAYS IN YOUR MUSIC!!!! So happy I finally found these. The packaging is really nice, the charging case is slim. Earbuds fit great, comes with different size cushions/buds so you can make sure they fit you properly; the one that was already on my pair fit me great. Snug in the ear but comfortable! Awesome sound quality. Hopefully when I take them for a test at the gym they will maintain my positive review and won't disappoint. Will update later!",5,1,2019-12-18,1,1,1
"Let me preface this review by saying I am NOT an audiophile or expert in any sense. I'm just a dude who wanted good earbuds, and knows very little of the science or technical qualities that makes good earbuds/headphones. That said...I recently jumped into ""true wireless"" earbuds for the first time last November with what I thought was a decent budget set (the J29), but the right earbud stopped making proper contact with the charging case JUST after the return window was up. After getting Amazon customer service to issues me a refund anyway, I looked for something else, did some research, and found these for a similar price, with good reviews across the net.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,1,0
"Update... Used them the next day and the right ear bud was at a lower volume than the left ear bud.  Amazon is swapping them out for me.  I took them to UPS today (they have to be shipped ground because of the lithium batteries) so getting them back to Amazon is taking much longer...not sure I understand why.  I'll post again when the new ones come in.  Hopefully that won't be an issue.  And hopefully the tinny sound quality will also be gone.Just unboxed them.  The presentation is very high quality, much nicer than expected.  I put them in and they were a little uncomfortable.  Not a problem...they came with three other earpieces.  Quickly found a set that fit.  Paired the ear buds to my iPhone 11 very quickly and easily and began to play music.  Sound quality is very good... exceptional when you consider the price!  The touch controls work very well, though I don't understand how to adjust the volume on the buds.  They feel like high quality buds.  The case also feels and looks high quality.  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0

"Purchased these ear buds for my wife as a gift. She is so happy with its performance. Sound performance, especially the mics, are fantastic. I personally feel like good sound performance are fairly common for tiny earbuds but mic quality is mostly subpar for wireless tiny ear buds. While there is slight echo while speaking, the voice pick up is pretty loud and clear.In addition, my mom accidentally left her entire ear buds and charging case inside her pants when doing laundry and it survived a wash cycle inside the pocket completely. Everything worked flawlessly coming out of the wash. While ear buds are expected to be water resistant, I am extremely impressed that the charging case also survived the wash. It speaks to high build quality of the entire product. I am 100% satisfied with this purchase. Now I want to get a pair for myself.",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"Based off of the reviews I had high hopes for these headphones. I want to say that the sound quality is pretty good!! Also noise cancellation is great too. But although they work well if I'm at my desk studying or not moving, the moment I yawn, or shake my head, jump, jog, they fall out  I have small ears so I made sure that this brand came with extra attachments to ensure a good fit, well... I tried them all and the smallest ear piece seems to fit best but not great. I wanted these headphones so I could workout, practice dance, and use for my live stream classes as a microphone. Unfortunately I can't do that. I mean I get running, that would knock them out of my ear I guess.. but yoga? Common. The touch screen is very sensitive, Everytime I try to adjust the headphone snug to my ear again I end up turning them off or skipping songs or whatever. Sadly I will be returning these since I can not use them for what I needed them for.",2,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"UPDATE: I previously wrote a review about how great this earbuds were, but I’m recanting that statement. My first pair became defective after only a few weeks of use. I had dropped them once; it wasn’t a bad drop, but I assumed maybe that was why. I quickly traded them in for a new pair and vowed to be more careful with these ones as they appeared delicate. Well here I am a month later, just about to pop in the ear buds, and they don’t work. I’ve honestly only used this new pair 2-3 times, and now they’re dead. My return window has closed, so now I’m out of luck getting my money back. DONT BUY.",1,1,2020-4-30,1,1,0
"I have to say that I hadn’t ever heard of TOZO  before I purchased a pair of their T10 earbuds. Unfortunately I lost one, so I decided that I would try their T6 earbuds because they offer touch controls. I have only used them for a day, but so far I am extremely satisfied. The sound quality is great for my ears and the noise cancellation is surprisingly good!  I’m sure that will be even more appreciated on my next airplane flight. These are waterproof enough that you can wear them in the shower, so I have no concerns about using them in the rain or for a sweaty workout.. The ability to use my wireless charger for the battery box is also a huge convenience. I also find that the fit of theses earbuds is superior to Apple’s products. You can tell that Tozo put a lot of thought into getting a perfect and comfortable fit. In the box you will find the earbuds already have silicone covers on them,  but then TOZO went a step further and provided five other size covers in the box, so that you can get the optimal fit for your own ear size. Try the different sizes and follow the included guide to getting a good fit, and you’ll find that they won’t fall out. Finally, the touch control features work flawlessly  and are worth the step up from the T10s.  Thanks, TOZO! A+",5,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"...it would sound like this. I had the Tozo T-10s before these and really liked them but an unfortunate drop on the day of jury duty led to their disappearance. I briefly switched to a pair if Axloi and they failed to deliver, with their weird, yet cool, design. After returning them, I ordered these and I am pleased to say they work as expected. Base is deep, speech is clear and sounds are crisp. Noise cancelling is excellent! I have yet to fully test the touch commands but so far, everything seems to work great!

"I was looking for some earbuds that I could take to the gym and was impressed by all the positive reviews on the TOZO T6. I thought this would be an easy winner for me. I loved the sleek look of these more that anything, but once I put them in, they wanted to run away screaming. I did try every fitting provided and screwed them into my ears like instructed. Plus it wasn't like I was jumping around or anything like that. Just laying down and getting back up slowly. Yet, they continually kept falling out and every time I tried to re-position them, they would pause the music or increase the volume or something because of the touch features. Very frustrating! When they did happen to stay in, the sound quality was pretty weak. It had no bass and was very hollow sounding. I get way better sound out of my $20 JLab rewind over the ear headphones. I do think that for me the fitting was the major factor. I might have strange shaped ear holes. I will say that returning these to Amazon was very easy, got my refund the next day.",2,1,2019-11-7,1,2,0
Does the job but every sensitive...Somewhat good for running but if you're wearing a headband it will stop due to the movement....Good for the office or a place where you're not moving around much...When low battery one will only work and turn off even tho I have 15% life battery....,3,1,2020-4-14,1,3,0
"How can this be possible the best got better. After owning the T10 for sometime thinking that they where the best, out comes the T6.  The T6 have exceeded the sound quality (not by much) and the usability of the T10. These air buds have been made better by the ability to know have touch sensor capability. This has made the best airbuds better.  The smaller charging case is a plus as you can now carry them easily in your pocket. I believe that there is no equal having owned several airbuds costing twice as much.  You cannot match the sound performance and pricing of the T6!  They are the best value airbuds on the market.  After mastering the touch control I have parked my T10.  For those 1 star reviews that claim the sound quality is poor, do not believe them.  The bass on these are incredible just like the T10s.  The mic is just as good as the T10s.  I am extremely satisfied with them.  Not sure how TOZO can make a better airbud but if they do I will be sure to try them.",5,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0

"Headset guy for the most of my life. Recently baught a Taotronics Wireless Stereo Headset to replace my Corwin E7 set I had for 4 years. But what made me finally invest in the earbud side of the audio world is for the compact and easy of use they come it. After looking around and reading a good amount of reviews and experiences, I settled on these.From the one day use, I am impressed and can totally see the appeal of the whole Airpod craze and obsession that some people go into. Definitely happy with them in terms of quality and performance. And honestly, I am still debating whether to return the headsets I just got. Not that they are bad but because besides using them for travel and maybe home, these new Earbuds I can see in the future my go to for casual outside listening. We shall see!",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,1

These bluetooth earbuds provide an amazing quality for the money. The audio quality is satisfactory. As far as cost is concerned the audio quality is as good or better than you could expect given the price. The buds have a very good battery life and then drop into the charging case for many recharges. The case is easily recharged and charges rapidly. The case is also very compact and fits into the small pocket on jeans for ease of carry unlike many other wireless buds that have a large and cumbersome case. Tozo customer service is very good and provides prompt and fair resolution to all concerns. The one caveat to this product is that the buds are not waterproof. Do not rinse the buds in water. I would recommend these buds highly. Great value!,4,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"I purchased these wireless earbuds because my job requires me to be on a lot of conference calls and I need to multitask while participating on the calls.  Being able to hear and be heard are obviously very important.  I wanted to get away from the tanglesome wires I'd been using but didn't want to pay $100+ for a decent set of wireless earbuds.  The TOZO T6 True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds met all of my requirements beautifully.  They're an economical device that looks really sleek and perform very well.  The setup was a piece of cake, taking only a few seconds for the pairing to occur.  I love the touch controls which make it simple to perform volume adjustments without having to shift the earbuds in my ears.  I've already recommended these earbuds to others at work and one of my coworkers who has a much more expensive competitor's brand is very envious of my sleek and well performing black set over his okay performing white set.  I would buy these again without hesitation.",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"TOZO T6 are the best valued earbuds or headphones without any competition. The T10 have even stronger bass and a cheaper price point which were my first TOZO earbud and if you prefer tactile response (physical button) over the newer touch control then the T10 are for you. Personally, I’ve found that the T6 while having a smaller driver resulting in less bass still have enough bass and improved overall sound quality. The smaller driver also allows for a more compact earbud and charging case alike as well as more efficient energy usage resulting in improved battery life of the earbuds and the charging case while smaller and finally easy to carry in your pocket, still manages to boast a longer battery life than the T10 as well. TOZO has kept their excellent engineering reputation by improving literally every aspect of the prior T10 model for only $10 more. Couldn’t ask for anything more than that, especially considering how high they initially set the bar with the T10’s!! I am excited to be purchasing the T12’s by the end of the month and see what amazing improvements they’ve made again over the T6. Each new release becomes my new #1 earbud and main daily user.- TOZO -",5,1,2020-6-30,1,1,0
"After looking online at various models, I chose the TOZO T6 to replace some Enacfire earbuds (pictured), maybe 2 years old.  Very glad I did!  The T6 sound quality is clearer, and the bass is *remarkably* deeper, not overwhelming but impressive.  I was happy with the Enacfire I'd been using until I dropped and broke the charging case, but I had no idea earbuds could sound even better.  Each earbud is about the same size as those from Enacfire.Pairing with a 2020 iPhone happened automatically, right out of the T6 box.  If only all gadgets could work so well!  With the Enacafire earbuds, I would have trouble pairing with the phone many times, just trying to start them for normal use.  The Enacfire's problems with pairing seemed to get worse over time, really. My Enacfire also lacked volume controls on the earbuds themselves.  That's a really great feature of the T6 in my opinion.  The T6 buds my ears nicely, so that the passive noise cancellation is pretty effective.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,1

"These wireless headphones were really easy to setup , and they came charged. I would say they are a great starter pair, to see if wireless headphones are for you. If they are, then you might want to invest in a hugher quality pair.

"Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. The sound quality is great and it blocks out most background noise. They charge easily and hold a charge for a long while. I love the portable charging case! They quickly connect to my phone when I open the case. I have small ear canals and the second smallest size is just a little too big, but the smallest one is too short so I can feel the end of it in my ear which is uncomfortable. My ears are adjusting to the slightly larger size.My biggest issue with these is how sensitive the touch sensors are. I read other reviewers saying that they use them in the shower and I was like, ""perfect!"" because I often shower while my roomie is sleeping and don't want to wake her with my music. Problem is that the touch sensors are sensitive to water, so I'll be going about my business and a drop of water will land on one of them and my headphones will think that I'm trying to turn up the volume so it's suddenly blasting in my ears (or pausing the music, or turning the volume all of the way down, etc.). Once this happens, you can try to put it back to your preference, but if your hands are wet sometimes the water might stay on the sensors and continue adjusting without your consent.",4,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0

Getting this right before every classes became online was indeed a stroke of good luck as it helped me listen clearly to my lectures while giving me the freedom to move around whenever boredom strikes. My roommate was surprised that though I was using it continuously daily, it has not once been a problem and frankly even I am. For its price it has indeed given good sound quality both in terms of music and also listening to others speak. Does not really have noise cancelling, but it still does drown out the surrounding noises if you do increase your volume to the maximum. 10/10 would recommend buying this if you are indeed looking for an amazing yet cheap alternative for a bluetooth headphones",5,1,2020-3-25,1,0,0

I'll be honest, I had pretty low expectations despite all the positive reviews but I figured for $60, it couldn't hurt. Couldn't hurt?! WHAT AN UNDERSTATEMENT.First of all, they connect quickly and easily. The voice that says ""pairing/connected/etc."" is a little laggy and creepy but that might be the one and only downfall of these. I most often wear one at a time and I usually only catch the tail-end of ""connected"" by the time I get it from the case to my ear.

"These earbuds ""burned"" out in less than 3 weeks.. At 1st the volume went dramatically down to the point where you could barely hear anything.... Eventually they just went out & then would they would not hold a charge at all. I contacted their customer service & that was a waste of time.... Also, it was difficult to get a good fit in the ear despite a few choices of the rubber ""caps"" that came in varied sizes.... The real kick in the a** is that I ended up in the hospital and the return date expired.... So, I'm not only without earbuds, I'm without the money I paid for them.

I purchased these ear buds to work with the wireless adapter I have so I can listen to TV at night without disturbing others.  They appear to be well made and come in a very nice box with all the cables you could need.  At max output volume the earbuds are a whisper only.  I have tried them using the SPDIF and using the 3.5mm aux plug sound out from the TV - same results either way.  Other earbuds I own have much higher volume but the sound is tinny so I wanted a better sounding set of earbuds which these claimed to be.  These are not usable and I'm not going to go thru the Amazon hassle of returning so its off to the garbage can with these.  Guess I'll be back to my over the ear heavy Sennheiser earphones for now.

I really had hope for these but with the nice look and feel they fail to do one of the main functions which is to have a conversation.

"The product was shipped in a timely manner, they serve their purpose, there were many choices for ear pieces to fit your ear canal.  Because I’m a woman, my ears are a bit smaller so the main piece is slightly larger and a tad uncomfortable at first so I likely won’t wear them for long periods of time (which was never really my plan).  I definitely cannot wear them in my ear and lay my head on my pillow at the same time without it being uncomfortable but I just change from one piece to the other depending on what side I’m sleeping on.  I will say that the directions that came with them were not totally clear in their meaning (and very small to read!), and I’m still going to have to do quite a bit of playing around with the touch option on them because I keep accidentally restarting a song. I’m sure that’s just a matter of time till I figure it out, but it’s not necessarily easy to figure out from the directions.  These are my first Bluetooth wireless  ear pieces, so I didn’t know what to expect. They certainly are cost-effective compared to AirPods.",4,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
I searched a lot for the right earbuds to replace my wired ones that broke. I was looking at some very expensive ones but kept coming back to these. I first looked at the T10s but really liked the idea of having touch activated controls on each bud.Item arrived sooner than expected and worked right out of the box! Paired easily and instructions were simple to understand how to use the touch controls. Took me only 2 tries to find the right earbud size. I've now done multiple runs and workouts at the gym with these. They are comfortable and sound quality is great! They do not fall out or even feel like they will after 30 minutes of hard running!,5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,1
"I guess I should start out with saying that I usually wear over the ear headsets and this is my first wireless earbuds.  That being said, the first week I wore it, I was concerned about the earbuds falling out of my ears and they did fall out on a few occasions.  The second issue is that when you try to adjust the earbuds in your ear it changes a setting and you have to adjust the setting again.  The company sent me a new pair when I complained and I was impressed that they cared that I wasn't happy about the earbuds.  I had my kids try out the earbuds and they had no complaints about how they felt and no concerns that they would fall out so I think my concerns are more that I am not used to wireless earbuds.After more use and changing the size of the earpiece, I felt more comfortable with the earbuds and less concerned that they would fall out.  The sound quality is fine.  The charging case is very nice.  All in all, I am content with the earbuds now.",4,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
I bought these earbuds mainly for the gym and so far am impressed.Fit: these fit very comfortably and securely.  I use the smaller ear tip that is included.,5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"I love the size of the case for these earbuds. I also have the tozo t10 earbuds and that is a major improvement is the case size. Although getting the earbuds out of the case can be a bit difficult at times. The noise cancelling is awesome! I can go to the gym and put these earbuds in and not hear anything else. Its fantastic! One downfall of the t6 is they do not get nearly as loud as the t10. Now this can be a good thing so you can't turn the volume so loud that it can cause hearing problems, but at the same time I would like for these to be a bit louder. Another issue I have been having is when I use just one earbud at a time, which I do frequently, it will lose connection randomly, even when my phone is right in my pocket so there was no reason for the earbud to lose connection. It is a bit frustrating, but the connection does come back after about 2 to 3 seconds. Overall I do really like these earbuds. I like being able to skip or replay songs and adjust the volume with them, which is another improvement over the t10's. I definitely recommend these or even the t10s to anyone who wants a good alternative to some expensive earbuds.",4,1,2020-3-9,1,1,0
"I’ve waited a little while to review these as I wasn’t immediately sold on them. My main issue is the sound is... hmm, how do I put it? The quality is actually pretty good but it seems sort of trebly if that makes sense. I haven’t owned any other wireless earbuds so I am not sure if that’s just how it is until you splurge for something more expensive or what. I really like these for my part time cleaning job- no wires to get in the way, fit in my ears worry free and comfortably. The battery life is pretty good, so no complaints there. The range is shockingly good, imo. They also work great for hands free phone conversations which is awesome. Eventually I’d like to upgrade to something with the sound quality I’m looking for but without spending a fortune these are a pretty good value and I’m glad I got them.",4,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
These were actually a great set of Bluetooth earbuds for the price. Audio was decent although it lacked bass. The mics were pretty good for calls but did let in a good bit of background noise. The battery life was pretty good. They only actually died on me one time in the three weeks I used them.They were fairly comfortable as well and stayed in my ear pretty good with the smallest size earpiece. One of them fell out of my right ear several times on a day that I was really sweaty working in a hot attic. Other than that day they both didn't fall out much no matter what I did.,4,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"I've been using this product for a few months now, and I have to say it lives up to *almost* everything it claims to support.The sound quality is of great quality, which was my biggest concern in switching to a new brand of headphones.",1,1,2020-7-15,1,1,0
"The T6 was my second bluetooth earbuds, after a previous Tozo pair. Before getting the T6, I researched my options by reading dozens of reviews for different brands of bluetooth ear buds. I decided to go with the Tozo T6 Headphones and have no regrets.Out of all the wireless bluetooth earbuds on the market right now (and there are A LOT!), TOZO T6s kill it with 5+ hours of battery life. Couple that with the sleek charger case, which gives you multiple charges on the go in a short period of time, and it's really a no brainer.",5,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"I was an early adopter of wireless bluetooth headphones and I've been impressed with how connectivity, sound quality, battery life, and water resistance has improved while prices have consistently come down (my original neckband headphones from LG were $89), but Tozo has outdone everyone.For $49 these headphones take up no space, wear comfortably (6 sets of ear fittings to choose from), look stylish, have great battery life--6 hours isn't the 8-12 hours available on some others, but 24 additional hours of charge in that carrying case make this far superior unless you need them on 8 hours straight--wireless charging capability, great sound isolation and fantastic sound quality.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
"It's been about 7 months since I've purchase these earbuds and love them so far. The rose gold is actually a really cute color. I liked them so much that I ended up purchasing an extra black pair for my boyfriend. The sound quality is great, especially for the price. I had no problems syncing it to my Samsung Note, and my boyfriend had no trouble syncing it to his iPhone. The battery life is great, and I can usually wait a couple of days before needing to charge it again.Some of the reasons I did not give it 5 stars is because it comes out of my ear often, and the touch control is confusing. I hate that when I try to readjust it in my ear, I accidentally do something funky with the touch control aspect. I guess the cons are mostly issues with myself, rather than the product itself.",4,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"This company has reached out to ensure I like the product. First time in a long time an organization selling on Amazon did this. The headphones stay charged for 7-9 days if you don't use them. When in use, I can have them in on calls for 6-7 hours of pretty continual use and they will not stop. If you charge them for 45 minutes plugged in or one hour on a charging plate (not plugged in) they will get near to fully charged. I use them at the gym, they work in the sauna and steam room. They have clear quality on calls. I will caution, if you are looking for very loud music, these are not for that. They are clear and crisp. Great for all around use. Not going to rock your world on the loudness. Overall, I highly recommend these to everyone looking for a strong pair of Bluetooth headphones.",5,1,2019-10-10,1,1,0
"So, this is probably my 5th or 6th pair of wireless ear buds that I have tried. Problems I found with others: horrible sound, good music sound but bad phone clarity, hurt ears after an hour, fell out while running, you get the point.I was hesitant of these. From the pictures they look big, like the weight is just going to fall out. But, I was really surprised to see how well they fit (when you wear them properly). Unlike apple or beats headphones, these don't hurt my ears after wearing them for an hour or longer. I found myself rechecking after a while to make sure they weren't falling out while running, but they never moved so I am more confident now and stop reaching up to feel them.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"I bought these because I'm a full time clinical master's in social work student and a case manager. Due to covid, I am doing classes, internship, and work from home. I have to be either on the phone with clients, instructors, or in zoom meetings nearly all day 5 days a week.I have been in need of comfortable earbuds with a good microphone.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,1
"Originally I purchased a T10 but it did not fit as I have a very small ear canal and even with the smallest adapter they were uncomfortable and kept falling out. I E-mailed TOZO and explained the problem and they suggested I try a pair of T6 and offered to provide them free of charge. I received the T6 set charged them and then wore them for three hours with no problems, which was a milestone for me. This week took them on two flights and they performed very well and were comfortable during the 2-hour flights. They do not have active canceling so they do not compare to the wired Bose headphones I also use, but they did an excellent job reducing the cabin noise and were very easy to listen to. They connected to both my phones without an issue one Apple and one Android and the call quality was excellent. TOZO's customer service was great. They did what they said they would when they said they would do it. Very happy with the TOZO T6 and with the TOZO brand and customer service.",5,1,2019-11-15,1,0,0

"Comfortable, and nice little compact charging case! The sound is stellar, better than the Power Beats3 in-ears. I returned them because I didn’t like the hooks over my ears and hoped these would be more comfortable. So far they are, and the better sound was a really nice surprise.  Also, I have the type of ears that DO NOT work with the hard Apple earbuds, in case that helps anyone. I can’t even wear them for seconds without it getting excruciating. I haven’t had them in for a full work day, yet, but these don’t hurt yet and I usually tap out pretty quickly if they’re uncomfortable. Will update if they start to bug me.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,1,0
"I've had these for four months, and initially I was pretty happy with them. At first, the battery lasted most of my workday, so ~8 hours roughly, sound quality and comfort were fairly good, and they blocked out noise pretty well.But the battery life has deteriorated quickly, and now they only last a couple of hours, sometimes less, even on a full charge. I would be still be disappointed but really not mind that much if they at least lasted long enough to be able to charge during my lunch break, but since they can't, they are almost worthless to me - I have to keep another set of earbuds to switch to while these charge, and honestly, the other brand's battery lasts a full day so why would I use these. They are at best a backup pair that can be used in a pinch for a short while, which for $50 is absolutely ridiculous.",1,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
Sometimes less is more. I purchased the Tozo T6 earbuds to hold me over while I was dealing with a warranty situation on my $180earbuds.,5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"Received my buds yesterday but didn't have time to play with them, this is my second go with them, though. I really like the look, size and quality of the majority of the Tozo T-6 earbuds and it's accessories. It is compact and pocketable. The color appears to be pearly white...pretty!  One of the main reasons I decided to go back with these truly wireless buds is its charging capabilities. They can be charged via cord (think it should have been at least USB Type C, it's USB-A to micro-USB) or through a wireless charging pad or the like. I have a TOZO charging pad--pictured above. Love the versatility. Regarding the sound quality, I don't think it's horrible but the volume is a lil on the low side for me-80's metal concerts. I'm gonna try out the different sized ear tips that came with it to see if that makes a difference.  I dropped one of them and haven't been able to find It as of yet. Oops. As far as battery life is concerned I haven't had the opportunity to seriously test it out. Over all great product.",4,1,2020-2-12,1,0,1
"Okay, this earbuds was really great until it stopped working. I bought it for my son last January and he did not like it. I was undecided if I will return it or not but I ended up keeping it instead. I did not open and start using it until 2 weeks ago. I do not use it much often after i open it. I probably just used it 5 times until it wont connect to my phone.. I did not drop this or put it in heat or vold or whatsoever.. i took good care of these earbuds because so far these waere the most expensive one i got. Yesterday, I dont know what happened, it just stopped working. It won't connect to my phone anymore and it said pairing failed. Anybody know how to fix this? I am really frustrated now. I really liked the sound of this earbuds but I can't use it because it won't connect to my phone.",1,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"I've used these for three days so far.  The ear buds quickly paired to my phone(pixel 3a).  I've used them for phone calls, listening to music and gaming.  Music - the sound is clear and crisp.  It doesn't take much volume at all.  The bass is off just a little...  Almost like too much reverb?  I'm going to try to adjust my phone sound.  Not a deal breaker.  Phone calls -  reception is clear.  No complaints on the mic either from folks that I've asked.Gaming - the sound is clear but I do notice a little lag that I don't notice with phone speakers or wired earphones.  This is my first pair of wireless earbuds so that might be normal.  By little - I mean 200 ms or less.  I only noticed it because I was relying on sound to tell me that the game was picking up the selection I had made.  I was double tapping a selection because I thought the first tap didn't take and got the sound during the second tap.",5,1,2019-10-20,1,1,0
"I have tried many headphones lately due to necessity and these have definitely outshone the rest in terms of sound quality. They cover a wide range with more bass than I've heard in any wireless buds. I'm honestly really impressed with the clarity of them too. You get a lot of charge out of them. I use them for running and find myself recharging about once per week.For some downfalls, I find that the right earbud doesn't quite fit into my ear well and will sometimes fall out while running. I have now had two pairs where this is the case and I'm not sure why. I have never had this be an issue with previous headphones but maybe I just have an odd shaped ear canal. Roughly two or so months into my first pair the right sided bud stopped working. I am generally a heavy sweater but with the water rating this shouldn't be an issue. Contacted customer service and they were great about getting me another pair and making sure I was happy. Hopefully this pair hangs in there longer. I'll update the review as needed but as of now I am very happy with the purchase.",4,1,2020-6-12,1,1,0
"I love these headphones. I've used a similar pair before and dropped one in some water so it was static-ey and would cut out. Since the battery on my old ones started to go this one had a great deal so I purchased it. I was impressed with the rechargable case and the first thing I searched was if airpod keychain cases would fit and they won't but super cute look a likes. When it comes down to the sound it comes with multiple earbuds so you can swap out the sizing it seems the ones with the red part in the earbud are the sound proof ones and I switched to the smallest ones. They work pretty well since I paired these to my laptop and had the volume up pretty loud my dad apparently was shouting and asking if anyone was home, I didn't hear a thing. Perfect for what I need them for. The earbuds without the red part are a bit thin when I switched to the smallest ones but it didnt fall out my ear or anything I just was afraid my nails would tear it but they are good too. I haven't tested the water proof aspect. one challenging thing is how to grasp the earbud to pull it out of the case and you just have to start with your finger in the middle of the case to scoop them out. I was trying to be careful when I pulled them out so thats what worked for me and my long nails. Would definitely recommend, its pretty cool that its compatible with a charging mat.",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,1
"Only have had the T6 earbuds for a few days but they are amazing... I had the older version, and I needed a second pair. These sound about the same, better battery case though...I originally bought some air pods but they wouldn't stay in my ears during jogging or even fast walking. I was so angry that those stupid things  were so expensive but didn't fit properly...",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"In short - can't go wrong with these, esp at the price point!  I own a few TOZO ear buds actually (love their stuff overall) & these are my favorites:*  Great sound overall - not too dressed up or colored.  Relatively flat frequency response -  nice and clear with rich low end!",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,1
"FIT: These earbuds are great!! I bought them primarily for playing golf and at the driving range but find myself using them all the time. They are very light and after changing the included ear cups to the correct size, they fit snugly Enough in my ears that they don't fall out when hitting golf balls. I've owned 3 different pairs of Plantronics and they did not stay in as well as the T6's.SOUND: The sound quality is excellent. When going out I wear just one so I hear people talking, emergency vehicles etc. and still take calls hands free. Receiving a call is quick and easy with one touch answer. I was concerned that the built in microphone would be an issue but it works perfectly. No problem being heard.",5,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"I did have a pair that was only $19.99 on sale (now $32) and they had the best fit and immediate sound cancellation. This one has several sizes to try on to achieve the noise cancellation effect. The rubber is ever so slightly softer, causing a little sound heard. The coolest part is that i can wear these in the shower. I deal with abuse on a daily basis 24/7, mostly verbal narcissistic and i have found myself numbing through always being on the phone. Since trying noise cancelling headphones i can sleep without a peep of my abuser, therefore less anxiety. More healthy activities the more i learn how to cope all alone, especially during the quarantine. Im so traumatized i dont ecen have my 3 children. Since finding the key to escape, mental health has improved through learning or listening to a book. Trying out meditation. Being able to tune out the world as needed! Without making a scene! Haha. I dont know if my earphones have a faulty charger but i had them plugged in and inside the case for a couple hours . Only the left side stayed lit up. I then tried them on and it said 20% only charged. I hope it works. Will do my best to update.",5,1,2020-3-25,1,0,0
This is one long review; hopefully it will cover what people care about.IMPORTANT: Tozo has and will provide you with a free firmware update in order to fix a bug that causes the left earbud to become unresponsive. Just shoot them an email.,5,1,2019-12-29,1,1,0
"These ear buds are highly uncomfortable. While attempting to use them, they constantly begin falling out of you ears. When this occurs, if I attempt to push them back in, the ear bud react on various levels, including starting to rewind, sound only emerging from one ear bud, and disconnecting randomly. The random disconnection has been the most trouble, as my significant other has a night shift job, and sleeps during the day. When the random disconnection occurs. The volume is emitted from the tv, in turn waking my boyfriend and making him very unhappy. I plan on going out today and finding a new and more reliable brand. Tozo has waisted my time, which I already have very little of.",1,1,2019-12-28,1,3,0
"Let me start this review with a word of caution. I need reading glasses and didn't inspect the earbuds carefully before I paired them with my phone and tried them out. I tried three phone calls and none of the other parties could hear me well. I took them out of my ear and put my glasses on, and discovered there is a thin protective cellophane film on the earbuds for packaging. It was covering the microphone, and causing the poor performance. I peeled the plastic film off and made some more phone calls, and the mic worked just fine. Learn from my mistake.Like many of the previous reviewers, I was offered a free set of these because I already own the Tozo T10.",5,1,2019-10-3,1,0,0
"I bought these for running and the waterproof capabilities. Plus they were a bit cheaper than Samsung buds and have a Qi charging case.But these are horrible for running for me.  I run about 7min per mile pace and these are constantly slipping and I have to keep adjusting them. While doing so, I inadvertently hit the sensor and stop the music or skip forward.",2,1,2020-7-16,1,1,0
"I really like these! I had a pair of bluetooth Soundpeats, but my cat chewed through the cord. I opted for these because they have great reviews and no cord for my cat to chew through. The docking station is really neat and the buds easily plop into the magnets. I love how the case is a chargeable dock and storage case. It came with 5 different sets of silicone ear fittings, which is really nice because I usually end up losing them off my buds and my cat runs away with them. That and they're all different shapes. I can opt for bigger ones for a snugger fit. The sound quality is really nice--better than most buds I've purchased.  The controls are fairly intuitive and it's easy to memorize them quickly. Anytime you adjust the volume, the sound bar pops up on your device, which is a nice feature to have as a second check. This is day one of trying these, so I'm not sure about the battery life. If it sucks, I'll change my 5-star review. If you still see 5 stars, it's great! I'm not sure about durability yet. The material of the docking prongs appears to be copper. We'll see if the magnetic guides reduce wear on the copper. I'll update if they don't.",5,1,2020-3-20,1,1,0
"Finally!! This is the 5th earbud product I’ve tried. 3 others were inexpensive Apple airbud style and this is the 2nd earbud style product. I like the touch controls, small sized charging case, but most importantly the sound quality and microphone (not great but serviceable).  My top criteria are sound, fit and microphone. The T6 fits the bill for an affordable price. Right away when you get the boxed product, you can tell this is a quality product by the packaging. The sound, fit and feature set did not disappoint. I prefer earbud style to the Apple AirPod style because these are less likely to get in the way of COVID masks and my sunglass straps.I had preferred tethered wireless Bluetooth headsets for fear of loss but I’m sold on the quality of this product. The charger case also minimizes the possibility of me losing earplugs when I’m not using them.",5,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0

"Overall quite satisfied with the product, there is a slight delay in the connection over Bluetooth with the phone but since these are my first pods of any kind I don't have a comparison on connectivity with other similar products, I did notice the touch on the pods is not always responsive when answering a call, it's responsive when music is going on will try a little bit more and see if Iam leaving out something. Comfortable in the ear and don't slide or lossen up, have been using to talk and till now no one has complained about not hearing me properly.Sound quality is good but the sharpest when compared to my previous wired or Bluetooth headphones, the case is sleek and easy to carry and love the wireless charging haven't had any issues with the battery, over all quite convinent and so far I love them",5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0

I don't like the touch controls, I had rather have a button but it does the job and that would be my only complaint and it's more of a personal preference. Good job tozo.

Summary:GOOD,4,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"I tried these after using the T10s for a while. The sound quality is more balanced than the T10s, while the T 10s are thumpy and hit hard, the T6 sound much more balanced and tuned. It doesn’t mean the T10 are bad, it’s just the T6 has punchier bass and it’s response is more accurate. The finger sensor is honestly great as I struggled to press the button without shoving the earbuds deep into my ear with the T10s. They stay in the ear even better than the T10s, these literally do not fall off.  It’s impressively responsive and eliminated the problem of the buttons being too hard. The case is compatible with wireless charging and much slimmer than the T10s charging case. The only complaint I have that it seems the T6 earbuds do not get as loud as the T10s do. I work at a noisy dock moving things around with a forklift and I have to max out my volume to hear the music properly. The T10s held up with only 60-70% volume. I guess the compromise is sound quality or volume range (in any other scenario the volume is more than enough, so don’t be deterred because these are better than the T10s and are worth the extra money).These are an obvious upgrade to the T10, they sound balanced and better than the T10. The only complain is the volume range, but besides that they are a true upgrade from the T10 and are worth the extra money.",5,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"I wanted something wireless after losing my wired headphones and not wanting to pay for OEM products. I've stayed away from Bluetooth because the sound is usually trash, however the sound of these little buds are impressive. The fit is not.Pros:",4,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"These worked immediately out of the box. The sound quality is great and noise cancellation is amazing. Comes with 6 tip options so finding the right fit shouldn’t be a problem. Comes with a 1 year warranty. Works easily and as I said in the title compared to Apples Airpods only 1/3 of the price!!! I’ve read other reviews that stated people have problems getting them out of the case but if you notice in my attached picture, I have pretty large hands and had “0” issues removing them from the case. I’ll be sure to update this review only if something changes. I have them in as I’m writing this listening to my own original music from the Quantaphonics that has yet to be mixed and mastered and the sound quality is amazing so imagine how they’d sound listening to an official tune.***Check out Quantaphonics on all streaming platforms. Those horns sound nice and crisp but I may be a bit bias! Lol!",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"The sound is great and the battery seems to last a really long time. Love that you can charge it on a charging pad rather than having to plug in. They seem like quality earbuds and are solid and work well even when wet. The only thing I have a problem with is they just don't seem to fit my ears well (Even though the choices of ear buds was fantastic) and will even pop out of my ear from time to time. It may just thebway my ears are formed though. The only other issue is the touch control is really odd. My hair brushing against the bud will sometimes pause the music/movie. If I touch the earbud at all to reposition, I'll pause it, or make the music really loud or soft or fast forward. The touch part is really difficult.",4,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0
"I previously owned the Tozo T10 Bluetooth Earbuds, which I loved! I was offered a pair of these new Tozo T6 Earbuds in exchange for an honest review. Packaging is high quality. I love the sleeker design on the earbuds and the touch controls are awesome. Carrying case is smaller than I thought which can fit in your pocket. I just wished it came with a carrying cord attachment like the precious version did. The earbuds dont come out as easily as the previous version due to the angle they set in the case but not a big deal, just means they wont fall out easily. I love that the case lid is magnetic and very secure, as well as the earbuds. Sound is great, battery lasts more than 5 hours for me. I would definitely recommend these. Also the headphone function when taking calls is very clear.",5,1,2019-9-23,1,1,1
"Beautiful color (rose gold), very nice sound and it even has a decent base for the price paid. Kinda nice that it blends in with my skin tone as well. It gives you 7 different ear bud sizes which is pretty generous given the fact that other ear buds only give you like 2 or 3. Case they come in is really pretty and sleek looking. Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase! Happy that the many positive reviews were accurate! Also another thing that's cool is they come with an 18 month warranty which is nice to know that the company cares and wants to make sure you're covered if something happens to them! Also when you register your warranty and write a review they offer you a free gift! That's so awesome! Makes me love them even more!",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,1
"With so many positive reviews, I have bought the earbuds with high expectations. But already within the first day of receiving them, I had troubles with the audio such as increasing and decreasing the volume, since the earbuds did not respond to my touch. I had troubles with the touch screen as well such as pausing the video and shutting down/turning on the earbuds. Audio started cutting on and off while watching videos although the video was playing smoothly which was adding to my frustrations . During all these issues, I had continuously restarted my earbuds but to no avail. Now, the left earbud does not turn on anymore. The issues grew progressively worse as time passed. I now regret buying these earbuds, and I believe these technical issues outweighed the benefits.UPDATE: I would like to discuss about my experience with customer service throughout these issues. Although replies were relatively quick, it took a total of 14 emails (since April until June) with exchanges back and forth to finally receive a new pair of earbuds although it was clearly explained from the start (and throughout other emails as the issues increased) that the issues were not resolving itself, often receiving relatively the same instructions over and over again.",1,1,2020-5-24,1,1,0
"These are good ear buds as far as sound quality, comfort and battery life. The downside is I got them for running/walking and they cut out pretty bad. When in a armband it was non stop. I used them on my Samsung S9 Plus and a cheap mp3 player both cut out to the point of usless, airplane mode or only downloaded and firmware update didnt matter. Once I took the arm band off and held it everything was fine. I got a replacement thinking one defective I can get passed, but unfortunately it was a trend. The first I updated the firmware without a problem but no fix. Second I couldn't update at all. The brand tech support didn't respond. If your not running or holding isn't a deal breaker then they are great. Sound is great, bass is good and cancels everything around enough in my opinion. I run/walk +2 miles a day and I don't like holding my phone the whole time so its a deal breaker for me.",3,1,2020-9-29,1,0,0
I am really enjoying my new earbuds.  They pair very quickly to my devices and the controls are much easier to use that I thought.  Overall I am thrilled with these. So easy and comfortable to use.Update:,5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,1
"Getting them out of the case is insane.  They are so slick with no grip and there is so little room to pull them out it is crazy.  If you do not pull them out at the same time they do not connect together so you can spend 15 minutes with this problem every time.  The hardware is outstanding otherwise.  They fit perfectly great noise cancellation and battery life.  So frustrating.  Their coffin designed case for the 10 series is perfect, but this pill case is just bad.",3,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0
Purchased for my wife to use while running. Purchased on week before gifting to her. Wife used daily for less than one month before sound dropped out of left ear piece almost completely. Right ear bud works perfectly but essentially no sound coming from left. Both ear pieces are fully charged. Headphones are essentially worthless at this point. No option to return because by the time the problem occured because outside the 30 day return window. Waste of $50. Really disappointed. Would recommend spending the extra money for a brand/company that is known and trusted.,1,1,2020-6-28,1,1,0
"This is the 3rd pair of Tozo earbuds I have bought in 2 years. The 1st I bought was T10's and they sounded amazing except for the battery on 1 of the earbuds would always die sooner than the other and eventually it completely died. So I bought a 2nd pair of T10's (the sound and bass is amazing) and I've had for 7 months with no issues and I couldn't be happier. Now, I saw the T6 and I figured Tozo audio quality hasn't done me wrong so I bought a pair. And I couldn't be happier they sound just as good as T10's. Only detail I'd change would be the loudness, as they are not as loud as the T10's. In the end I plan on buying more in the future for my kids and I and I completely encourage anyone who is on the fence to make the leap and you will NOT be disappointed.Fred (3 time Amazon/Tozo buyer)",5,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0
"Looked around for a well priced EarPods so I wouldn’t have to break the bank, my daughter is 14 and loves her music. As a hard working parent spending a couple of hundred dollars on EarPods is unnecessary and most knock offs are terrible. Her mother purchased a low costing pair that lasted 3 months before they stopped working & charging. I did some heavy reviewing and these got the best feedback from like minded parents. So far she loves them: they charge quickly, hold their charge for a great time, can be charged on a charging pad via provided carrying case (she took mines), came with different size ear plugs, and they are definitely light with great sound quality. Hopefully they make it past the 3 month period, if they or don’t I’ll update...",5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"These headphones are great for the gym, they do not fall out of my ears when doing high intensity training. I have small ears so it is hard for me to find headphones that stay in and feel comfortable, these stay in and are comfortable for me. I like that they come with extra rubber ear pieces so they can fit all types of ears. The charging case is small and easy to carry around which is nice. I love the touch capability that these offer, I am able to touch once on the left ear piece to pause/play the music and touch once on the right ear piece to change the song. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a nice pair of wireless headphones. The bass on them is also super nice and the music comes through crisp and clear. Great headphones!",4,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0

I’ve been shaking my head lol and doesnt remove from ny ears very secured! So happy with it and cant ask for more, specially i had a $10 coupon as well, happy with the sound the product quality, very easy to pair because one u take it out from the case it automatically pairs right away, when im with spotify, song can reverse and song can forward, can volume down and Volume down the sound, when about calls, you can take calls and can reject calls, i love the case, looks like an apple airpods but much better because of quality and the price, very happy with battery life 5-6 hours and extra 24 hours of charging...noise cancellation ohhh yesss! sooooo happy!",5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"I bought many headphones or earbuds.  Most of them were low cost low quality.  Last one I used before I bought T6, was a cheap one made in China, its pairing button broke.

"Edit: My only issue after a week of use is that the silicone charging port cover is difficult to open. I've had to use a letter opener, end of a straw, anything thin and stiff to get under the edge.I've only had them a day, but so far so good. They have good quality and they're easy to use and pair. I have small ear canals and I am quite happy with how small the interchangeable tips go. I might take half a star off for the responsiveness of the touch pad controls: when I try to access my voice assistant (three taps) sometimes it thinks I'm only tapping twice, but I will get over that. I also love the color and luster.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,1,0
"You know, I'm something of an audiophile myself.These little buds have big sound, and it was made even better by swapping out the default sized earbuds for the slightly larger ones. Now, the earbuds fit nice and snug, so the noise cancelling is more effective, and the sound fills my ear like nothing before ever has - not even my desktop USB headphones. I'm extremely pleased with how nice they feel, the charging case is small as it needs to be and feels great in the hand. The touch controls respond well. It's a slick little package for sure. Not sure how well the battery will hold up over time, but it's rated for 5 hours on a single charge which seems great in my opinion! The battery could always be improved, though. It's hard to imagine the sound getting any clearer! When using with a phone, be sure to fiddle around with the  audio equalizer in your music player app, or download a third party one. This can help you adjust the balance of sound frequencies more to your liking, but by default it sounds great and an equalizer can let you adjust things further if you are so inclined. I got even more out of these buds by using an equalizer, and overall I just can't believe how full the sound is from these things. I am very pleased with this purchase! Great value for your dollar, in my opinion!",5,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0
"I’ve had these for almost a week and have used them every single day. From exercising to phone calls they work really well and the sound is great! One thing I really love is the ear tip sizes they offer - I have pretty tiny ear canals and then offer what no one else has so far, and extra small tip. My mom bought the T10’s but I’m a runner and went for something a little smaller that would fall out, that being said I haven’t run with them yet but I have done other active things and the haven’t fallen out. I love the touch activation, really easy to figure out. I also took a shower with them to see waterproof they were and how well they worked, super impressed! I ordered mine in white and they’re true white. I absolutely love these so far. No one reached out for a review, my mom ordered a pair so I decided to give them a try and haven’t regretted it. Great buy and under $50!",5,1,2020-7-17,1,1,0
"These buds sound amazing and functionality is great, especially for the price. I compared them to my husband’s Bose ear buds and cannot tell a $200 difference in the sound! The only minute difference is the low end is not as full but the “thump” is there. The mid range and high end are crisp without being hollow. The hands-free calling feature works and sounds great. They would easily have 5 stars if they fit better. Having 5 sizes of ear tips helps, but there needs to be something that secures them in the ear canal. The body of the bud is too heavy to use the silicone tip as the only means of retention. They would definitely benefit from some type of auricle structure like their competitors. They fall out  too easily during exercise, but are great to wear around the house.",4,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"Extremely easy to set up. Just remove the earbuds from the charging box, give them a few seconds to pair with each other (indicators on each earbud will flash red and blue while pairing), connect them to your Bluetooth device, and you are good to go! Sound quality is quite good. The “buds” are very comfortable, and several different fitting options are included. The packaging is excellent. The instructions are brief, but quite clear, and convey almost everything you need to know. The only small point of confusion I have noted, while reading reviews, is the location where the included micro usb cable plugs into the charging box (a small piece of rubber on the bottom of the case must be moved to reveal it) I have included pictures. Overall, I am extremely pleased with both the sound and quality of this product.",5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,1

"These are a great deal, I have to admit. I have lots of wireless headphones these are one of my favorites. My go to is my Powerbeat pros which are awesome with my iPhone, Apple Watch and IPad. I bought these Tozo on Black Friday for the fun of it, small wireless charging case, sweat proof, I’m a workout junkie and have had no issues with these. They pair flawlessly every time, no drops and they sound surprisingly good for around 40 bucks, crazy! The bass is not boom boom boom but it’s good, the Mids are fine, these Tozo’s have a crisp clean sound! I would definitely buy them again, they would make great gifts for sure. The only small complaint I can think of is the quality of the bud plug, I changed mine out with a spare from another set of phones, the outside of the bud plug was flaking off, easy fix thou.

"These earbuds come with a number if quak]lity features usually seen in higher-end earbuds selling for substantially more. Opening the box you can see several items that come with the earbuds. The ear cushions are numerous and allow you to select a size that is very comfortable to your ears. Not shown in the picture is the USB 3 cable that also is included.  It is quite short although this is not a sticky point at all, it would be nice if it were longer to accommodate easier access to hard to reach USB ports. It also is waterproof although you cant swim with them. The earbuds have excellent audio and functionality for either IOS or Andriod. Some functionality depends on which OS you are using as it is differing between OS's and some devices that have their own Bluetooth drivers. Overall this is a highly good value in all aspects.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,1
"I just got these recently, so I'll share my initial impressions and follow up in a couple months if anything changes.The presentation in the box is very nice, neatly laid out and tidy. I like the wide variety of ear tips.

"Update: Been using these for a couple of weeks and they now shut off whenever they feel like it, even with a full charge. Not just a lost bluetooth connection, they just shut off. Really annoying when your working out and have to stop to then them on and then wait for them to connect to bluetooth again. So frustrating.I like these much better than the previous model. Sound quality is excellent. They stay connected to my phone. My big complaint is the battery life. The buds last about 4 or 5 hours before needing charged & I have to charge the case every 2 days. I also wish there was a way to disable the fast forward/rewind button because I accidentally hit it on a regular basis. But for the price, these are good ear buds.",2,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
"Noise cancellation works too good, makes it difficult to hear anything else. Biggest gripe is that they often touch the sides of my ear and stop,  start, or change the volume on its own. And I have never been able to have a phone conversation with them. Every person I speak with says they can hear everything around me, but me. It gets very frustrating when people keep saying “I can’t hear you” on the phone, but you are enunciating clearly. I bought these to have hands free calling in my late model car without Bluetooth. But they have been unable to do that since day 1. So now they are just used to listen to music.",2,1,2020-3-8,1,1,0
"Ok, so this is my first pair of Bluetooth ear buds. I must say from the start that I am more than satisfied with my new Tozo T6 ear buds.  They arrived sufficiently charged for me to try out right away.  For someone who has not connected anything via Bluetooth before, I had no problems with making a connection with my tablet.  The fact that I can hear the buds tell me when I am connected is reassuring.  I also had no problem with the volume control tapping the right bud twice and holding to increase the volume, and then tapping the left but to decrease the volume all worked as described.  I have over the past few days changed out the soft tip sizes to get a fit that fits my ears correctly.  I don't worry at all that they would fall out, and they fill my ear canal to block out the noise from outside my ear.  I find that most of the music I listen to doesn't need a high volume to sound great!One of the comments I read before purchasing these Tozo T6 ear buds was that they are hard to remove from the case.  After just a few minutes trying different techniques,  I found that by using my right forefinger positioned between the two buds, applying slight forward and upward pressure, I am able to remove the right earbud with little difficulty.  Then removing the left one is real easy.  I have put a short video here to show just how I do it.  It also shows how to open the charging port, which is easily done with even a short fingernail.",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"Had a little problem pairing with my Galaxy phone, but I found a workaround. FYI, this was JUST my phone. My wife has the exact phone, and it paired with no problem. So I won't take off any stars for a ""me"" problem. The T6 looks great, feels solid, are comfortable and block out noise perfectly. I love the new charging case - you can open it with one hand, and the case can be wirelessly charged with my phone!Pairing is MUCH easier than on the older T10 - they paired left to right automatically within seconds, and paired with my Galaxy phone immediately. I also tried it on my Ipad with similar results. The sound is great, and I walked around my house with the phone in the bedroom to test out the range. I had no drops or signal loss, and I was beyond the 35-foot limit. The default ear plugs fit me fine, but there are extra sets of plugs for different-sized ear canals. I've been using them almost daily for the past few weeks, and no other issues at all.",5,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"I'll only report the design flaws I've noticed after using for the past 3 months since others provide full reviews:-The bluetooth does not automatically disconnect when the earpieces are placed in the charging case. This is needlessly annoying and requires you to enter your phone's settings to manually disconnect. If you forget to do so, later in the day you'll wonder why your phone has no sound or won't connect to other bluetooth audio devices.",3,1,2020-7-1,1,1,0
"I really love the pink color.  It's a lovely shade of a rose gold.  It comes with 5 sets of varied sized rose gold gel ear buds.

The Tozo T6 is a simple and easy to use true wireless ear buds.  They can either be charged with the included charging cable or via a wireless charging pad.  Either way is quick and easy. To sum it up, I highly recommend the Tozo T6 in the beautiful rose gold.",5,1,2020-3-4,1,1,0
These are the second pair we have bought. They pair quickly and easily with our phones. We have iPhones and android. We were using them a few minutes after taking them out of the box. The music and audiobooks sound fantastic. We have taken phone calls without any issues.  Overall we have been very pleased with them.  I like the fit. I have very small ears and earbuds usually do not fit well or stay in. I have been able to do yard work and walk/run the dog without any issues. My husband likes that he can’t hear us when he is watching tv or listening to music in his phone. But he will only wear 1 when he is riding his bike so he can hear what is going on around him.

The packaging is updated from many of the photos.  I thought I did not have a usb cord, but it was in a box under the spare buds.  They were easy enough to put in the case and get charged up.  They are marked with ""L"" and ""R"", but it is a bit small for my eyes.

"I've only had these headphones for a day, but they seem to be a great choice for the price range!  The box they came in was beautiful and well-organized, very protective.  There are a total of six pairs of silicone earbud caps, varying in sizes, which was very nice.  They were a little hard to remove at first, but by inverting the silicone and pulling quite hard, I was able to change them on the earbuds.  These are the first wireless earbuds I have owned, and I intend to take them running.  They seem very secure in the ear, and have not fallen out after vigorous head-shaking; I'm sure they'll stay in for running.  The earbuds fit in the charging case with the silicone earbud caps.  The charging case stays closed magnetically and the earbuds stay in magnetically - but they are not hard to remove.  By tapping twice on the earbuds, you can go back or forward to the next song (back is left earbud, forward is right earbud), and the earbuds say ""FORWARD"" as you tap them, which I could do without, but it does work.  I had some trouble fitting them into my ear, perhaps because I'm used to the wired apple earbuds, which are smaller.  They had no trouble connecting to my phone and showed up in the Bluetooth menu right away.  In the box is: earbuds (one of the six pairs of silicone tips is already on them), 5 extra sets of tips, charging cord for the case, the case, some very minimal instructions.  They come with an 18-month warranty.  When music is paused, the right earbud sometimes has some soft clicking noise, not sure if this will go away.  Overall, I like them so far, and I will update this once I use them more.",4,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
I was very impressed with this product and I believe it began to sound better after 3 days of usage. The part that mentions noise cancellation in this review on puzzled by because I have no idea that this product has that feature. I played several genres of music through these and they did a fine job. I like the recharging case so I can pack them and take them with me and was very happy with the power indication lights on the case. The instruction manual has difficult to read because the instructions are so so tiny and even with my reading glasses it just quite wasn't enough. The pairing of the earbuds to several Bluetooth devices was easy. When they are in the case they are a little slippery when you try to remove them and once they are in your ear it is slippery once again when you try to adjust them or remove them. If only a little texture was put on the outside for a gripping. That would give them a five-star overall. I'm still going to give this product a five-star but I wish the textured finish was and added feature.,5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"My boyfriend is a geek when it comes to sound quality control, and he compared these tiny and cheap earbuds to his expensive, refined headphones. It was a pretty good comparison, $30 vs $500, and he said that they both are great, his amplified bass while these are better with mid-tones, so voices sound beautiful here. I've been waiting to leave a review for these, because from the beginning I would find little problems here and there but comprehensible once you think about the price: sometimes they would stop working, randomly disconnect, and the smallest earpiece was still too big for my smaller ear like another reviewer pointed out.But then why only 2 stars? Well, the right earbud stopped working. At all. After a morning workout, I came home to recharge them for a bit and when I went to put them back on, I couldn't hear! Thinking it was a connectivity issue and I needed to 'restart' it (the little problems I mentioned before), I've noticed that it stopped working at all. Seems like it is just a piece of plastic, no way to reboot it.",4,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"For the price, I don't think you can find much better. These work well and are very light. The case (which I know is a big deal for lots of people) is very well-made and has a very solid and satisfying feel. I also appreciate the LED lights that show you the charge level of the case, which is not a feature on much more expensive earbuds.These are in fact true wireless and they have performed as advertised as far as I have been able to tell so far. Call quality is pretty good, too.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"I think these work pretty well.  You have to put the correct size ear piece on and make sure they are seated in the ear canal.  Once they are, they have good passive noise cancellation.  I am happy with blocking out the zero turn mower for three hours and all the ambient noise of being inside a house with wife and toddler.I have not read what others are getting out of battery life.  There is nothing I can do to get them to last longer than 5.5 hours.  I wish they would last longer.  However, if you put them back in their charger when you cook supper or take a shower, they are charged enough to keep on going.  Just putting them away today in their charger when I am not at my desk has prevented the low battery alarm all day.  I can live with that.",4,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"I'm pretty happy with the Tozo T6, so far. The packaging is nice, and the charger works well. There is a magnetic hold to keep the buds in the case, even when turned upside down, which is nice. The selection of rubber ear fittings is nice; one set works well for me. There are only two downsides: the touch control is pretty sensitive, so it's easy to activate it by mistake - this will take getting used to; 2) the L and R labels are tiny text, dark grey on darker grey, so they are hard to read even in bright light, impossible in low light. I don't know why designers do this. It's not hard to make the L R more visible to help fit them in the right ear (i.e. if you drop them). I know pulling them out of the case works (take out the R bud, put in right ear, sure) but there are times they get jumbled.",5,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0
"Very poorly designed. These do not stay in my ears during simple tasks, like walking. Forget working out or running with these!The touch sensor is so incredibly sensitive, that every time I go to readjust the fit (because they're constantly falling out), the 'pause' feature is activated.",1,1,2020-5-21,1,1,0
"I have purchased a few Tozo earbuds and I have found these to be my favorite. The Tozo 10 do not fit comfortably and creates sores in my ears so I tried these and they are super comfortable. Took a bit to get used to the touch technology. I have also purchased these for my daughter who has smaller ear canals and for whom the Tozo 10 was also uncomfortable and she absolutely loves them!!The only slight con is that the battery does not last as long as they claim, but 5-6 hrs is reasonable and works for me. Easy to charge and store!!",5,1,2020-1-6,1,1,0
"My Apple AirPods broke for the second time and I got tired of shelling out the big bucks for a so-so product that looks weird (white protuberances sticking out of your ears, anyone?). These TOZO T6 seemed too good to be true: wireless charging case, comfortable in the ear (much better than AirPods) with adjustable and cleanable rubber ends,  AND great sound for a reasonable price.At first I thought that my mic wasn't working when I used it on a Voice Recorder app on my phone, but I think that was about settings. Anyway, I reset the TOZO T6 earbuds according to the instructions and have been using them successfully all day to make phone calls: they connected to my MacPro, then to my iPhone 8 Plus, then back again to my Mac. You just have to turn Bluetooth off one to re-connect to the other.",5,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0
"I bought two of these and I really like them! They block out sound really well(which is expected since they're placed tightly into your ear) and the sound quality is pretty nice. If you're somewhere particularly noisy(like my husband driving his scooter) then it's hard to understand him on the mic, but I don't see that as a problem with the headphones really because there's only so much you can do when the mic is all the way in your ear. These earbuds look really nice, they charge well and they hold a charge for quite a while. The charging/carrying case is pretty awesome, it looks nice and it's sturdy. Overall I'm really happy with my purchases and it was really worth it for the price. I was a little worried because I have fairly small ears and that has been a problem in the past but these fit just fine.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
So far these are the best wireless headphones (earbuds) that don't cost an arm and a leg. Myself I can't wear hard ear buds because they hurt my ears but to my surprise this set comes with different sizes and depth for the part that goes in the ear. So far the sound is amazing compared to some others I have had you can head them perfectly fine over the mower and other stuff like that.I haven't had the chance to use them in rain and such. The touch controls are a nice feature I can even use the controls with my gloves on (smart phone friendly gloves your experience may differ).,5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"These are beautiful but not as loud as expected. It could be the videos that I was watching. They're kinda bulky and slide out if you bend over. I had to order eyeglass lancets so that I can keep up with them if/when they fall out. They easily connected to bluetooth for my Android cell phone and they came fully charged.  UPDATE: 07/22/2020Yes you can Plug the USB into a computer or power adapter to charge the case.  You place the ear buds into the left and right charging ports inside the charging case. The L (Left) and R (Right) are very tiny and difficult to see. Overall it's a great deal. I believe the quality of sound is determined by the sound source (ie. YouTube video, song etc that you're listening to.)",4,1,2020-7-8,1,0,1
"So, I bought these earbuds after messing around with another TOZO product (the T10) and KZ (not completely) wireless bluetooth earphones. I wanted see if it was possible to find earbuds that offered the same convenience and look as AirPods with the same or better sound at a lower price. My results of my search are below.SOUND: 8/10",5,1,2020-3-18,1,1,1
The case is a pretty color. I have only had them for a couple of weeks. They have some nice features such as automatic pairing and can be used one at a time.  The sound quality is pretty good. They charge pretty fast and the case can be used 3 to 4 times charging the earbuds before it needs to be charged itself.Now for a bit of a problem for me.  I am small framed and need tiny earbuds to fit me well. The smallest one they come with does not stay in my ear and they can fall out easily.  I am scared I am going to use one..lol!,3,1,2020-2-3,1,1,0
"I bought these at the end of April. For 2 and a half months, I loved them. They have awesome sound quality, best I've heard from earbuds, hands down. They are comfortable to wear, easy to pair and navigate and fast charging. However, in July the batteries suddenly started draining super fast. I can leave them charging overnight and it will say they are fully charged but will completely drain within 10 to 15 minutes of use, making them basically useless to me. It is beyond the return window with Amazon by 2 to 3 weeks. I have contacted the manufacturer today. Hopefully, I just have a fluky pair and it can be resolved. I will update if they are able to fix the problem. I should also mention, my husband got a matching pair at the same time and his are still working fine.",2,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
I was looking into getting true wireless earbuds without the crazy price tag as these are just for work. A lot of researching pointed to this brand.Some of my favorite things so far:,5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,1
"Max Volume is extremely limited. Not nearly loud enough at max volume. Bass is lack luster. Doesn’t turn off when removed from ears. These might be just ok for mowing the grass but otherwise I’ll stick to my other earbuds for everyday use.  At least if they fall out of my ear and get chopped up by the mower blades I didn’t lose much. Also these seem to be made cheaply, simply because I can hear the plastic rattling inside the left earbud. Pairing process between iPad and iPhone is a bit tedious and not a very easy process. I would not recommend these to anyone for everyday use. Cheaply made, pairing process between devices is tedious, volume not loud enough even at max volume, noise cancellation is just ok.",1,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"EDIT: I unfortunately lost one of the buds. I contacted support to ask if I could buy one bud, but they said that they would just send another pair over for free. Great and speedy customer support.I like to think that I enjoy high-quality audio, but I wasn't about to shell out more than a hundred for some wireless earbuds I knew I was going to use on my phone. Some things to keep in mind for my perspective:",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"Great choice of 6 different silicon earpiece sizes and overall fit is above average as is security. Good tonal balance once you get the right earpiece size. Wireless charging worked flawlessly with my Anker charger. Pairing was quick and easy with both my android phones. Touch controls worked well but sadly no volume control and no gesture control, just tap and hold.Call voice quality is a 7 out of 10, legible but definitely Bluetooth so-so. I wouldn't use it for a conference call where I was the main speaker, but for any other case it would be OK. Charging case is a great size with 4 LEDs for progress, but no independent charging status for the individual earbuds. Still, at this pricepoint, I give them a solid 5 stars and will enjoy using them for my international travel.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"A recent IOS update made the earbuds stop working; they immediately disconnect once Play is pressed.  Tozo has a firmware update to fix the issue, but it is not available for download on iPhone, only Android.  That said, Tozo offered compensation for me to delete my 2-star review, which I did.  Since buyers need to be aware of the firmware issue and Tozo provided good customer service (although I find the practice a little deceptive), I am posting a new review with this additional information as an FYI.",4,1,2020-3-16,1,3,0
"I was in need of a new pair of earbuds, to replace my Anker SoundBuds Slims from 2017. I needed something with good battery life, durability, and of course sound. For a few days prior to purchase, I browsed Amazon and read reviews, scrutinized options and features, so on and so forth. After narrowing down my search, I settled on the decision to get a pair of the TOZO T6 in black. Ordered them on December 30.For me, they fit great! They come with a handful of silicone tips of various sizes. I have smaller canals, so it was nice to see a pair of tips that were sized just right. The weight is barely noticeable, and really only when first in my ears. They're also not ginormous looking.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"I was skeptical about how these could be so good for such a low price, but you can believe the reviews: these are excellent and will please everyone but the most audio demanding of listeners who have the hearing of bats. Ergonomic, these fit snugly and comfortably. Tap controls are very sensitive and I'll have to get used to them. My only beef is that I have big hands and fingers and it's tough to get the buds out of the little tight charging case. The brief manual is written in chinglish (awkward English), but it was easy to figure out.Is a great deal. They are great buds. I can't hear any difference between these and my old Sony ones. Don't hesitate if you need wireless buds.",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"Very easy to set up and use.  They work in the shower, but I still have to wash my ears and I have to find a way to use them while getting my ears clean.  I put them on and it is hard to take them off because I enjoy listing to them so much.  I was very pleased with the price, quality of sound, and very easy to use.  wish I could get the same great sound with my hearing aids. Charging the batteries is also very simple and easy to do.  If you enjoy listening to your music,  you have got to try these.  You will love them.Oops - after one month of use, they have stopped working as they should.  Lights on the charging case will not go out and it drains the battery to the point where they will not work.  Hope I can get some help in fixing this problem.",2,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"I've been using these 8 hours a day, 5 days a week since I bought them a month ago. I have them paired with my work phone and I make many calls a day.Ive paired them to my work iPhone, my personal Android and my windows laptop. They've had no problem switching back and forth between devices.",4,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"I received these headphones on January 20th 2020 and loved them. They have good sound quality, are great for phone calls, and stay in place while I run or bike. Unfortunately, they are now having issues pairing to my phone after only 3 months of use.I've looked for ways to contact the seller, but it seems like i'm unable to and the return window has passed. Based on the reviews, this seems like it happens how and then, sadly it looks like I also received a pair that has this problem.",2,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
Bought just for fun. Tired of fighting wires. I’m a little older. It took me some time to figure out yes there is a place to charge with usb under rubber rectangle piece. I ran out and bought a charging pad because I thought I HAD TO HAVE IT. Duh no. Now I have another gadget. And I’m liking both!!! They are noise canceling. Ive yet to be able to shower with out a fail from water proof. I will try adding a larger ear piece for water proof ability.  Very sensitive touch controls will take some getting use to for this gal.,5,1,2020-2-21,1,1,0
"This is my third pair of this type of wireless earbud and I find that I do like these the best for two reasons. The first is that they fit so much better than the soundpeats, my first pair, and the Tozo 10s, my second pair. The profile doesn't look much smaller but feels much smaller protruding from my ear much less. The second reason I like these pair is the fact that I don't have to push a button to get a response. These work like my cell phone's screen with just a touch. The tozo 10s I have to push into my ear in order to get a response. The touch is a too tough. With the Tozo T6, the touch is gentle and slight but you do have to read the instructions to know what each touch does. I tried to do it and figure it out intuitively but that didn't work. I do use them to listen to music and podcasts at times and knowing the touch for fast forward or rewind or volume is helpful when I don't want to pull out my phone each time.I have noticed that the battery seems to not last as long as the t10s or my soundpeats but I also noticed that these will turn off if not used for quite a while, while in ear. Because of the fit and touch response I would recommend them. I like bass but I've not used a pair of wireless buds - that were not of the big brands - that had that booming base that I like in the car. These are nice and flexible to where I link to my work computer and my phone and can listed to each as needed.",4,1,2019-9-29,1,0,1
"I'll start off by saying I was not paid in anyway to do this review. I saw all the positive reviews and thought it was possibly fake but just know I didn't receive these for free or anything like that. I bought these as a second pair of wireless buds to go along with my Galaxy Buds that I've owned for about a year now. I needed something that I could work out in and was completely waterproof unlike the Galaxy's. I'm pretty surprised by the quality of these things. First of all sound quality is at least on par with the Galaxy's, it all comes down to preference but the T10s are a bit bass heavy where the Galaxy's have plenty of mids and treble. They are both equally clear in my opinion but as far as value goes the T10S win. The case is small and it's a nice bonus that it has wireless charging. The ear fit is pretty good but not perfect. Sometimes I feel like I'm having to twist them deep in my ear to keep them from falling out but they do stay in if you get it right. They do get a bit uncomfortable after an hour or so but I usually don't workout longer than that so it doesn't bother me. Overall a great pair of buds for $50 and definitely impressive that they compete with my Galaxy Buds that I paid more than twice as much for.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"I think these have connected to my devices easier than any other wireless devices I've ever tried. There are multiple ear pieces to try for comfort, and they really stay in your ear without shoving them in tightly. They sound great for a relatively inexpensive set,  and they definitely block out other sounds to make it even easier to enjoy. I'm not sure how many hours the batteries actually last, but I've used them on & off throughout the day many times and have never had the batteries go dead.",5,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
"I am very disappointed in this product... from the reviews I read, these were great for working out and running. They are not. I have tried several of the sizes of ear pads.. not one works for me. I am CONSTANTLY having to push them back in! Constantly! I do not feel comfortable using these outside my house. I do a lot of outdoor running and trail running.. these are NOT for that! For the money I paid, I wish they were better. Sounds great though.",2,1,2020-9-29,1,1,0
"*** Revising my review. Would give no stars if I could! Bought on May 7 and today Sept 11 they overheated in my ear! A quick crackle then VERY hot. Let it cool off, put in charger (while close eye kept on it). Took them out 3 hours later and now it lasts 5 minutes, starts to get hot, says low battery and shuts down. I am very unhappy with this entire scenario and it's too late for a return! Now no ear buds and no money to replace due to covid. Means I'm devasted as I used them daily. **** 》old review beyond this point 》They sound great, but don't accurately stay in charging box. Meaning not always charged and they spontaneously connect to my cell phone while in the box not in use. Interfering with what I'm doing. Very inconvenient. Too bad, because the sound is great.",1,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"These are my first earbuds and the moment I started playing music it was like an experience I'd never had before, including with quality cover-the-ear headphones.  The music was inside my head, not outside my ears. Wow.The kicker was when it paired with my TV, which previous headphones had refused to do.  Not only could I exercise while watching and not miss a word, but I could pause Netflix by tapping on the earbud. Just wow.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"I ordered the pink ones. I work on a college campus and see all the students with ear buds and was surprised how expensive the apples ones were. These are a great price, very pretty color and case, the sound is really good. I can walk around my house talking to people with no issues. I'm still trying to figure out the right size for my ears so they fit comfortably and don't fall out but since I'm a newbie to ear buds I think I just need some time with them but the more I use them the more I like them.",4,1,2020-3-26,1,1,0
"I have been using the headphones for about 2 weeks now and I have come to the conclusion that they are possibly the best headphones I have ever used. one of the most important things that I have come to appreciate about these headphones is the sound quality and battery life. and the description it states that it can last up to five hours of battery life but in some instances I even get 6 hours. What is it's most redeeming qualities is the sound. I like bass, and these headphones punch like some over ear studio headphonesi have used. You can not go won't with these phones.",5,1,2019-12-25,1,2,1
"I've always had issues with wireless earbuds not wanting to stay in my ear when moving around. These TOZO T6's do a great job of staying put. You have 8 different rubber tips to choose from which more than any other pair I've tried. Simply put them in vertically then twist them towards the back of your ear and they get a nice, firm fit.The sound is phenomenal too. Usually a lot of wireless earbuds don't have punch in the bass or the levels don't feel distinct. These are not those ear buds. The bass has very good kick to it and the highs are very distinct too.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"I have just received the earbuds today, but so far so good!  I was worried about this particular style because I have a conch piercing. The earbud does touch it, so I'll see how it fairs in the long run. They are a very pretty pink. They charge wirelessly, which is awesome. They also come with 5 different sizes and shapes of silicone ear pieces. The sound quality is good, but not amazing. I'll update when I can provide a more in-depth review.Update:",4,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
"There is no other way to say it, but these stink! They disconnect constantly, stop constantly, and are just trash. For example, if I turn my head to look in a different direction, the music stops, skips, or they shut off completely. I am so sorry I went with these. The cheapest pair ever made couldn’t be worse than these.Update: I just received an email from Tozo stating they would send me a new pair because mine must have been defective. I will update again once the new pair is received.",1,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0

"Outstanding quality made earbuds. Wanted to buy other fruit shaped brand ones but just couldn’t justify the outrageous cost of those. Lots of good reviews already on here for this product, and for good reason. They sound great, pair flawlessly every time you take one out of the case, and the noise cancellation is top notch (assuming you use the correct size insert for your ears). On that note it comes with various sizes to fit any ear. They look good as well, the case will charge them both multiple times with each charge, charge fast itself, and also has wireless charging for those of you that have one already. Highly recommended product! Seriously, look no further. Side note - the T6 is the newer version, not T10..weird I know. Get the T6 they are better!",5,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0
"Wow and wow!! I can’t say enough awesome things about these wireless earbuds. Oh yeah why haven’t they been in my life sooner?? 😄 The Bass is great( I’m all about the bass literally lol gotta have it!!) the touch panel works just fine, and the case is awesome. I got the rose gold color, so pretty!! I highly recommend you save yourself some dough and get these Tozo wireless earbuds, they are equally as good as Apple AirPods! I love Apple, but the accessories like AirPods are just ridiculously overpriced in my opinion. You gotta just buy these, you’ll know what I mean😊",5,1,2019-12-17,1,1,1

"I decided to switch to these earbuds after using $20 Phillips earbuds for 5 years after one bud crapped out. I assumed these would sound a lot better and offer a lot of mobility freedom. The first thing I noticed is that the TOZO earbuds didn't sound great, the bass is a bit flat. After two days of use and consistent charging, the TOZO earbuds stated that the battery was low after 4 hours of speradic light use. At 20% battery life, they died. The charging case runs out of power pretty quickly and does not last a full day without needing to be charged. I also have pretty small ears and due to a positive comment thought it wouldn't be an issue, but even though they have in ear covers to fit into small ears the weight from the body of the earbuds is not supported enough due to design (and also my tiny ears that cannot cup them).As for the good, they pair extremely quickly and they are easy to connect to any device. You can easily use one bud at a time, it doesn't matter if it's the left or right. The mic wasn't as bad as the reviews stated, it's a little fuzzy, but picks up a lot considering where the mic is situated. The touch controls take a lot of time and practice to get used to, but the basic play/pause function is very handy.",2,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"These earbuds are extremely easy to pair with your devices and the sound quality is very good for the price point. Honestly I can't fathom spending hundreds of dollars on something that I could potentially loose because it is so small, when these provide great results at a quarter of the price. Some people have commented on the comfort of the buds, saying that they felt either too large or small. The earbuds come with multiple sized ear pieces which you can switch out to find your perfect fit. This was an added bonus feature for me as the ""one size fits all,"" never really worked for me. That being said, it may take some patience to switch the ear pieces, it takes a little fussing to get the new ones in place, but be patient, it's worth it to get the perfect fit.",5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"These are my first pair of wireless earbuds and so far they are great! Very comfortable and long battery life. I usually listen to podcasts and talk shows for at least 4 hours every day. For spoken word these are excellent, the battery life has never failed (again, so far), and they are comfortable in the ear. Sound quality lacks a little when it comes to music, but not much. There is absolutely no noise canceling function for these earbuds, but in a quite area the sound is good. Probably not ideal for travel (i.e. airplane). They are quite comfortable in the ear and come with numerous ear attachments, but I would not trust them running. I have walked around with them, but I doubt they have the stability to stay put for an actual run. Overall a great pair of earbuds for the price",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
I've been using these for a little while now. They're very nice and work just fine.Some things you should know:,4,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"I liked that the connection to my phone was fast and that you can use one at a time if your wanted to. But the touch control is way too sensitive. These are waterproof and I did test it. While in the shower the water drops were touching the controls like crazy.. pausing, playing or changing the song to the next. One of the pieces even got turned off. So I imagine walking outside under the rain would do something similar if drops touch the controls. Having this experience, I prefer button controls which will only get pressed when I do it. I returned these and got another waterproof Bluetooth earbuds with button controls. But if you think you won't be in situations where the sensitiveness would be a problem, then these earbuds are a great option for the price. Great sound quality and they do stay in your ear.",3,1,2020-9-5,1,1,0
"This are the best earbuds in the market. I tried a pair of Bose SoundSport Pulse Wireless Headphones, but wasn't convinced because the battery did not last longer and the bottoms were hard to push. I tried the Powerbeats Pro Totally Wireless Earphones and also was not impressed, the sound quality was OK but mostly paid for the brand name.Then I purchased my TOZO T6 True Wireless Earbuds and at the beginning I was skeptical, but when I tried them and started playing music, I realized that they were what I was looking for. They are so tiny but powerful at the same time, they have too many features that are missing in the brand name competitors. The battery lasts for hours, the charging case gives these buds a bust that keep them charged for additional hours. They are waterproof rated IPX8 which is huge because the majority are water resistant IPX7. The controls are very sensitive and nice and they come with 18 months of extended warranty ( If you buy other brands you have to purchase a separate warranty) and lastly, the brand's customer service is amazing. I had a question and they reached back in a few hours.",5,1,2020-5-19,1,1,0
"If you’re anything like me, you’re looking for a Bluetooth headset that’s comfortable and sounds good. Right away, I eliminated the Apple AirPods. While I’ve been told by anyone that has them how great they sound, I can’t bring myself to pay $200 for ear buds that will get less than 20-25 hours (likely mischief less) use a week. I came across the TOZO T6 while searching. They had good reviews, 4 1/2 stars and almost 30k reviews at this time, and I checked a few tech sites for “professional” reviews. While not everyone thought they were the greatest, many agreed they were the best in this price range. They come with a charging case thats capable of wireless charging, 6 other cushions for the buds to change for your liking, and a micro USB charging cord.I got them out, and picked the cushions that felt best for me. I jogged in places and jumped up a few times, which thy seem to stay in and felt fine. Granted, this isn’t a true “fitness” test, it was probably more movement than I’ll typically do jogging and such. I then paired it to my phone (extremely easy), paired them to each other (automatic when each is turned on), and played a couple songs. The sound is very good, especially considering they were $40. What really surprised me was how good the bass sounded. The controls are a little weird, but I’m sure I’ll get used to it (just like my last few headsets).",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"I’m really sad because I really wanted to love these! I don’t if mine are defected or what. They work just OKAY when you’re listening to music, but the volume doesn’t go as loud. There’s a static sound in the background as well. Every single time I use them to talk on the phone, whoever is on the other end tells me they can’t hear me. So once I disconnect and use my phone normally, they say that’s much better. I bought my boyfriend the TOZO T10 for Christmas because I didn’t know there was a newer version. I thought since so, they’ll be even better because my boyfriend LOVES his and he uses them to run, workout, music, talk on the phone. I give it 1 star for kind working for playing music.",1,1,2020-2-7,1,1,0
"The fit is a big deal for me. It falls out of my ears. I guess I have a small ear canal. It’s not as comfortable as the AirPods.

"I’ve gone through three other pairs of ear buds and these are finally the ones for me. Most ear buds fall out of my ears because they are too big, but these fit perfectly, comfortably and have multiple fittings for other sized ears.The sound is great and when they are on I can’t hear anything in the room. Much to my children’s dismay. Finally I can listen to a podcast or a book without constant interruptions.",5,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
I'm really happy with these earbuds. The sound quality and noise cancellation is awesome. Controls are pretty responsive and intuitive. Pairing was immediate and easy.

"It's all bad. The case barely charges from wireless charging, the controls are awkward and unpleasant (for example, changing volume involves long presses against your ear and a series of ever-louder beeps over the audio), the earbuds are not clearly denoted R and L (which becomes annoying if you ever set them down), and the sound quality is -just- acceptable for the price range. My experience with them was two uses, with the second use was me going back because I couldn't believe they were that bad given their relative popularity. There are many competing options, and this is one of the poorer ones. My only positive comments are that they fit well and look sleek.",1,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"These are great for the price, unbeatable.  I had the previous T10s and those were nice as well.  What I love about these over the T10s is that the T6s have a smaller more compact wireless charging case, nice white indicator lights on the charging case to know the charge level of the case. Wireless charging case works great, also has a micro USB connector to charge as well.  These sound great, have perfect amount of bass, not too muddy or tiny.  The vocals are also nice and crisp.  Only thing that is a little annoying is the touch controls, they are a bit finicky and easy to accidentally press the touch control when you're just trying to adjust the earbud in your ear.  I prefer the button controls on my Soundpeats or the T10s over the T6 touch controls.",4,1,2020-2-15,1,0,1
"I thought I had a good deal at half the price of Apple Airpods, but I’ve been burned.I bought them for running, but at the first sign of sweat they will not stay put and require constant re-cramming into my ears. There are multiple sizes of rubber parts, but the problem is the enlarged body of each bud meant to house the completely dysfunctional touch feature. As I’m constantly pushing and twisting it back into my ear, I’m triggering the touch controls, skipping ahead, reversing, powering off, and maxing out the volume that results in an electronic voice interrupting to state “Maximum Volume” half a dozen times.",1,1,2020-4-14,1,1,0
"I liked how easy they are to pair, sturdy quality, good sound quality.  I use only one at a time, they run out of battery power when you are listening to music, maybe 4 hours in.  I am sure that if you only use them for phone calls they last much longer. I only use one at a time because they cancel out ambient noise/sounds so well, that I would not be able to hear anything else.  Perfect for our new ""Normal"" COVID world, you should not be handling your phone as often,or not at all.  COVID 19 virus was found on surfaces we touch often, in a study conducted in various hospitals, 88% of cell phones had verons.  This means using hands-free, cord-free is the preferred method and least likely to be a source of transmission.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"I got these and proceeded to take them outside and do some weedwacking.  The good points - they fit good in the ear, sweat didn't bother them and they sound great.  Bad points - they are hard to get out the case and the battery doesn't last long.  I had them on for about 1 hour when the they started acting like they were getting Bluetooth interference, that is the sound kept cutting in and out.  This is was on the edge of property where their is nothing electrical around that could be causing an issue. The more I used them, the worse it got.  This is certainly a lot less then the advertised 4 hours of run time.  So if you are looking for something that lasts longer than 1 hour I would look elsewhere. .",3,1,2020-5-10,1,0,0
"I was rather displeased with this purchase. I bought these headphones with hopes of decent sound quality and hopes that it lived up to their claim ""TOZO T6 wireless earbuds can last for over 6 hours' playtime from a single charge and 24 extra hours in the compact charging case."" However I found that neither of these hopes were lived up to.The sound quality is very lacking on the low and high end making it sound like it needs the bass and high treble boosted. It can be overcome on my phone, which has its own audio EQ(Equalizer) to boost the lows and high treble, but this is not possible on my laptop, which is what I use these with the most.",1,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"Have been impressed with the sound quality and how well they block out ambient noise. The microphone works well too and while on a call, people I have asked have said they can hear me clearly without too much background noise. They stay in fine but since they are a bit top heavy they can fall out during exercise. I have tried using them to listen to music while sleeping but they are a bit chunky and not that comfortable if you are a side sleeper. They do work well to mitigate outside noise though.  Battery seems to last a long time on one charge. They are a good value for the price for general use. I don't recommend having both in your ears while walking on busy streets because you can't hear cars or other hazards very well.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"I was hesitant to venture into the world of bluetooth earbuds, fearing that sound quality will be inferior to wired ones. I also didn't want to pay the high prices demanded by Apple, Samsung, and other name brands. The dizzying array of selections by so many manufacturers didn't help matter either.I narrowed it down to Tozo's T6 and T10. Reviews of the products seem promising. I decided on the T6 as it's smaller (both the earbuds and the case), but was worried the reported lesser bass would disappoint. Turns out, it has more than enough bass for me.",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
I purchased these when I purchased my new phone. I know they are listed as waterproof but never had any opportunity to use them in such a situation.It is too late for me to return these now so I have to give them negative review.,2,1,2020-5-29,1,0,1
"These are my first totally wireless earbuds, and I have been very pleased. I've waited on purchasing wireless earbuds for a while because it has seemed that every option has had some major connectivity, battery life, or sound issues. These meet or nearly meet my expectations in all of these areas. Connectivity is seamless. The second I pull them from the case, they connect with my phone and I can start playing music.For the size of these headphones, the sound quality is strong. The only time I notice some degradation is when there's heavy bass. That said, these headphones are tiny, so I don't expect incredible bass from them.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"The packaging was very well done, and sealed well so you'd know you really got a brand new product straight from the factory. It comes off with a free 1 year extended warranty. The instructions are concise and the pairing is very easy. The case is very compact and it's dimensions are pocket friendly. The ear buds magnetically snaps into place when you put it in the case. There are extra ear pieces with different size to ensure you can use the right size for your ear so that it doesn't fall off easily. I use the smallest size and it sits perfectly in my ears. The quality of sound is amazing. The battery life last a little over 5hours. I used t10 bass boosted for exercise and still used a wire for normal use. But with this product I am now officially wireless free throughout the day and i don't think I'll ever go back to wires.",5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,1
These have great sound. I’ve had others that don’t have good volume. These have great volume.They come with 6 different adapters to fit your ear. I have very small ears so I don’t often find ear buds that will go in my ear and stay. With the smallest adapter they fit perfectly.,5,1,2020-3-9,1,1,0
"I've done a lot of research on wireless ear buds, so if you want to save yourself some time/aggrivation, just give these a try. I figured that I could buy them, and if they weren't great, I wouldn't be out too much money.The good news is that they've exceeded expectations and I'm thrilled that I got these without spending $200 on them. I'm not in the music biz and I'm not going to notice subtle nuances that professionals might. I'm a regular person who likes to listen to music, audiobooks and make an occasional phone call with the buds. Great for working out, traveling, working, you name it.",5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"2 months ago, I purchased the TOZO T10 earbuds after a colleague recommended them to me. I needed a cost-effective product to replace my broken LG Bluetooth headset, but I did not want sacrifice sound quality. After I got the T10’s set up, I was surprised at the great sound quality of the earbuds, which was on par with what I was used to from my LG.  Even better, these were wireless, and came with a little charging case that would protect them in my gym bag.  I was happy with my purchase.Recently, TOZO contacted me and offered me a set of the upgraded T6 earbuds in exchange for an honest review.  While I liked my T10’s, I couldn’t believe the difference with the T6 earbuds. As soon as I popped the buds out of the case, they immediately paired with my phone—no setup required on my end.  The design of the T6 is smaller and sleeker than the T10 model, which makes a big difference in terms of comfort for me.  The sound quality is excellent.  If high volume is your thing, these earbuds get the job done.  I wound up changing my Spotify sound settings from “Normal” down to “Quiet,” as the volume levels of the T6 are superior to the T10.  Additionally, the touch controls of the T6 are better as well.  I only have to gently tap the left bud to pause, tap twice on the right one to skip to the next track, rather than push in to click.  I was even able to leave my office wearing the earbuds and enter a different room without my phone, and the earbuds kept on playing just as if I was sitting right next to my iPhone. The next time I go for a run in the rain, I will update this review to reflect its ability to hold up in inclement weather.",5,1,2019-10-1,1,0,1
"I liked that they stay in my ears when I run on the treadmill. They offered 6 different sizes and styles of ear pieces which is nice. I think the battery size could be a lot better, but it is probably due to the small size of the carrying case. I rather have a smaller carrying case with a crappier battery life than a larger carrying case with a larger battery capacity. I do like the range I can move before I lose connection with my phone.There are two small things and one large thing I cannot stand about this product. 1) I don't like that the music takes a while to start after you pull them out the case. 2) It is hard to grab the earbuds out of the case and the orientation is weird when you take them out. It would be nicer if you could grab then and then did not have to manipulate them so you could put them into your ears right away. 3) The thing I dislike most about the earbuds is that there is this woman's voice that says stuff like ""primary,"" ""secondary,"" ""reverse,"" and ""forward"" really slowly every time you turn them on or move forward or backward to a song. I wish there was a way to turn that off.",5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"This is an updated review after I had some issues with my initial pair not having small enough adapters for the ear canal. I was contacted by TOZO and provided a replacement pair which had more ear inserts than my initial pair came with. This solved my main issue with the headphones.The sound quality is really clear and connects over bluetooth HD audio. I was impressed with the clarity and was able to distinguish sounds very clearly. I enjoy listening to many types of music with the headphones, though rap won't be very satisfying for many users do to not having very deep bass.  The bass is impressive for the size of the headphones for most music.",4,1,2020-1-18,1,0,1
"Nothings worse than working out and having to fidget with your headphones non stop. I loved these at first when I was trying them on in my house.. the noise seems fine and I found an insert that fit my ear (you have 6 options, which is pretty great). But once I started working out I could hear everything but my music and the sound quality was so poor... they kept trying to come out of my ear and I eventually just stopped using them. I’m still on the search for great quality sound.",2,1,2020-8-8,1,1,0
"Como digo, no me explico las calificaciones 5 estrellas que veo. Ya anteriormete había comprado un Tozo T-10 para mi mujer y es una pasada, así que compré otros 2, uno para mi padre y otro para mi hijo. Al mismo tiempo, decidí encargar un modelo más nuevo, el T-6 para mí. El resultado no pudo ser más decepcionante. Prácticamente no tiene potencia de sonido en comparación con el T-10, por mucho que en las especificaciones ponga que comparten características. Llegué a pedir otro al tiempo que devolvía el primer T-6, no sea que (puede pasar) estuviese defectuoso, pero no, el segundo modelo que recibo adolecía de la misma falta de potencia de sonido. Finalmente, también devuelto y me encargaré un T-10 para mi también. Es una pena porque el diseño, la ergonomía, el tamaño de la base de carga, ... todo es mejor en el T-6 que en el T-10, pero es que si a unos auriculares les falla el sonido, que es lo básico que pides, el resto poco importa.Actualización 21/06/2020",5,1,2020-5-11,1,1,0
"I bought these based on the high rate of positive reviews and frankly I wonder if I just got an entirely different product. The sound from these is barely audible. Yes I’ve made sure they fit in my ears. Inserted all the way in. About 1/3 the volume of any other earphones I have, and very tinny at best. They are useful for listening to audio books while walking or slow paced running. Music simply is unbearably awful and they are useless with any background noise at all, even my own breath while running or biking hard. The user controls are awful—the only way to reliably turn them off is to put them back in the case. My experience seems to be completely different than what I’ve read and I’m horribly disappointed.",2,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"These things are amazing. I used them for a week and I still can’t stop talking about them. Waterproof, amazing sound quality, long battery, wireless charging case, The list goes on and on. If your looking for a cheap pair of wireless earbuds that blow AirPods away, here they are. Touch controls are as follows. One touch on either side: pause play. two touch on right earbud is skip forward, three touch on either side opens up Siri or google. Touch and hold on right increases volume and left decreases volume. Easy to get after a couple days. My buddy said they sound as good as his $200 buds. I stood in a downpour and they never stopped working. I was over 50 feet away before any stoppage occurred. I left my phone on my bed stand and walked around the house and yard, no stoppage. These things are just amazing. 1 year warrenty with product. Multiple earhole sizes for different people. I’ve listened to rap, electronic, country, dubstep. It didn’t matter, I could hear everything perfectly. When I called my friends and family to test the voice pickup they all said they couldn’t tell any difference between call quality. All I needed to keep these. I actually Think these buds gained me money because I was gonna buy the AirPods. Not anymore. this company will be the only one I purchase from in the future. I hope they send me the newest model to test out. I also bought the $16 wireless charging pad from them cause why not? Lol honestly these are the airpod killers. Make sure your read the directions how to insert in ear. Rubber earpiece goes down not up lol. If your looking for sound cancelation in an in ear bud, Well your not very realistic are you and you’ll be paying $200 for Sony’s or some other crap. If your looking for AirPods for $60? HERE YOU GO!!!!",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"Ordered this Nov 29th.  the price had dropped. there were many earbuds for sale over the weekend between black friday and cyber monday. I was looking for a set that could be used to listen to my TV and not bother anyone.  I was looking for something small that when  I put in my ear and laid on pillow it would not me uncomfortable .  Arrived next day and have been using for a week.  If you look at the pictures each earbud only weights about 4 grams or .14oz.  thats just a little more then a penny that weights 3 grams.  also put up some pictures of the case and what it weights with both earbuds in.  equal to about 3 K-cups. the case does not stand up because the bottom is rounded.  I have also posed  some pictures with a USA quarter.  to give you an idea of the size.  based on other picture I saw on line I thought is was smaller, it is a little bigger then I expected.the earbuds fit well with the small earcups.  the large and medium were to big for me.  was able to lay on pillow without discomfort and they stayed in while I worked out.  I'm not an audiophile so the sound was good to me.  distance for connection was good but I didn't go more then 20 feet from the source.  Play time was great.  My connections lasted over 5 1/2 hours. I do have a wireless charger so could not test that.  Overall very happy for the price.",5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,1
"First day of use. These earbuds sound great. I've listened to music and audiobooks. Both sound clear and crisp. The battery lasted for more than 5 hours of continuous use out of the box. The left bud was giving a low battery alert while the right still had a 50% charge remaining (according to my phone BT status). I placed them in the case to charge. The full charge took about 2 hours. I charged the case while I was using the earbuds. The case had a near full charge out of the box. I'm not aware of an active noise canceling feature for this model.Day Two. Used the Tozo T6 while in the shower. The insert said they could be used as such. Worked like a charm. Although I see no documentation of active noice cancelling, the sound of the shower was much muted while in use.",5,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"Wow. Just wow. I wasnt expecting much since ive had TWS before and was never too impressed but these take the cake, I mean these are the cake, the party, and all the gifts.

"These are my second pair of wireless earbuds and while I like the sound quality better on these, I really struggled with the touch sensitivity. My previous pair I had to physically push the buds and got the click feedback. There was no accidental adjustments made while wearing them, especially while adjusting them in ear. These however, the volume dropped to min while I was wearing them because my ear touched them while I was walking. I couldn't adjust them without them reacting. The music paused and unpaused, the phone's assistant was summoned, even redialed once. All this happened eaither while adjusting or my ear touched them. That's super frustrating.Sound quality was pretty good. Not a ton of bass but a good mid level sound. It was balanced and clean. They did not get as loud as the previous pair.",3,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0

"This is the third pair of wireless earbuds I purchased.  While not mentioning the name, the first pair were heavily advertised but the bass was so heavy it was hard to enjoy.  They also frequently lost the Bluetooth connection and the battery life on the second wasn't good.  I read the reviews for the T6 and decided to give them a try and boy am I glad I did.  The sound is crystal clear while maintaining solid bass.  My kids are all Apple fans but I couldn't see spending over $200 for a pair of earbuds that I'm basically going to be using while walking the dog or in the gym.  While I haven't tried their Apple earbuds, I can't imagine they could be worth an additional $200 but that may be the old man in me who is still cost conscious.  The final selling point is the wireless charging.  So much easier than trying to keep track of the charging cable.  If you are looking for a quality pair of earbuds at a reasonable price, these are hard to beat.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"I picked Tozo T6 Earbuds because of charging in the case, they came in white, and they were affordable for me.

"THEY WORK OMG. I realise this is a low bar, but they paired instantly and worked like a charm. I was actually shocked how good the sound is and how comfy they are. They come with a ton of silicon earpieces, so no matter what weird size your ears are, you should find something that fits. The noise cancellation is very good, for earbuds. Obviously not the giant sound-blocking quality of crazy expensive over-ear headphones, but those make my head hurt anyway. These are brilliant. Buy them.",5,1,2020-8-22,1,1,0
"After contemplating for weeks on what wireless earbuds to purchase and what options I would use or would be useless (noise cancelling )to me I decided on The T6 buds.  I read quite a bit of the reviews and and came too the conclusion that these were right for me . Money was no object I could of paid $250 and look like the other Idiots walking around with a white stick protruding from there ears that will be lost or useless when the batteries die or buy the various other models  but the features that these little guys have sealed the deal. Too be put it simple they sound awesome look ok on your ear  fit tight in you ear  canal and are comfortable ,the touch controls are just plain intuitive and simple too operate . The case/ charger is small well designed and seems to be rugged enough . I can speak about batterie life yet but id rather toss $50 out the window than $250 + when the eventual batterie failure occurs .",5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"The online reviews both on Amazon and third parties were very positive for these.  I purchased them and for the first week, they were great.  Then one day I put them in and the right ear bud was dead.  Would not pair or charge.  Would not reset, nothing.  When I put it into the case to charge, the charging light would just flicker (see my video).  I emailed the company as the manual has no guidance for what to do if things go wrong.The company, however, immediately replied with guidance on how to fix.  Unfortunately, the pair could not be fixed.  TOZO offered to provide a new pair to replace the broken ones.  I received the new set and they seem to be working great.  Very good customer service and support.",4,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
"These earbuds are great!  I have the Apple AirPods Pro to compare these to and I've gotta say, the difference between these and the Apple AirPods Pro is negligible - at least, not $200 worth in difference. I will keep these for $50 over my $250 Apple AirPods Pro. And the bass! Comes through these really well, wow! They are easy to use (even for the newbiest newb) and super easy to connect (they auto connect when simply removing from their case - makes life easy!). They do drop off about 60' away. I clearly haven't figured out the noise cancelling function, which is due to my own ineptitude. I was reluctant, but so glad I tried them as they have saved me $200 over the alternative I nearly kept. Good job!",5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
"Not sure about noise cancellation, but as wireless Bluetooth earbuds, these are well worth the price. I’ve had the T5s for a while and like em, but after >1 year of steady use they don’t last as long on a recharge, so I opted to try the newer T6 model. Case form factor is nice and small. Still chargeable via Qi charger, too (one of my basic criteria for buying — too many cables around these days!). 5 sets of rubber ear buds for different sized ears. Sound quality is better than the T5 and not as bassy.

"I ordered these after trying the T-10 which did not have small earbud options. I always need the smallest size for these buds to actually stay in my ear. I loved the T6 until about two weeks of ordinary use, one earbud would not charge and died on me after 10 mins. So I realized the product was defective and asked for a replacement! I did receive one. But the “new” one came without outer packaging, no instructions manual, and some of the buds seem used which is gross because I see ear wax. So I’m angry and am returning the replacement as well because I shouldn’t have been given a used one as a replacement when the first product was defective. the first one I had (that turned out to be defective) had an 18month warranty sticker on the earbuds case cover, an instructions manual, and all the other parts, plus outer packaging which proves it was new. The replacement they sent me had no earbuds case covering (meaning no warranty card), used buds, no instructions manual, and no outside packaging. It’s more likely than not they sent me a used one, and also delayed shipping despite 2 day guarantee. Soooo I’m pretty pissed. Despite that, I like the noise cancellation, the sound quality could be better but it’s pretty good for the price. I returned the defective one, and will be returning the crappy replacement they sent me. I don’t even want to try it because it seems used and I am not messin around with anything used by another person amidst a pandemic.  Can’t believe I was sent a used one as a replacement. other than this annoying and frustrating experience, if T6 is new and not defective, it seems to be a good product.

Now the replacement set has the same issue but now also has a link loss issue. At least once a day the connection to the earbuds will drop even if I have my phone in my hand.

"These ear buds are absolutely perfect for my needs. Very easy to connect and very easy to keep charged if you are a user like me. The battery life is only 5 hours but who listens to ear buds for 5 hours straight? What's great about the battery life is that when you are not using them, they magnetically snap back into the case and start recharging automatically with no cord. So I get a full 24 hours out of them no problem.The charging case is very small, fits nicely into any pocket. Very convenient, one thing I will say is I wish it had a place hole for a lanyard or keychain. I believe the T10's had a hole for this.

I’ve had other top rated brands and these sound better than most at 1/4 of the cost! I have not yet worn them on the motorcycle (street bike), so that will be the real test.

HmmmBut, they don't work well in the shower because if you even slightly brush against them, they either pause, stop, skip ahead and in some cases turned on that annoying Bixby everyone hates.  So if you can avoid touching them by accident, and keep your hands away from your hair, head, ears, then they are very good. Maybe for the car or a walk in the rain.

"These are acceptable for my needs, which do not include listening to music. I just need to hear speech rendered reasonably well.One irritation is that the sound occasionally cuts out completely--no static, no nothing--for maybe a second at seemingly random intervals. This is clearly due to these ear buds and not my other devices, as the latter stream sound  smoothly in all cases. If I were listening to music I would return them STAT for this reason, but as it doesn't happen often or for long and I am using these to listen to speech, it's less hassle to guess how to fill in the blanks than to re-package and return.",3,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"Really love these headphones, I often just use one at a time and leave the second in the charging case. They last me all day, the case is perfect for fitting in that tiny pocket men's jeans have, and the sound quality is awesome. The headphones do have their own volume as well, I usually set my phone to the max and put the headphones on level 4 (they go to 13 - That's just counting the beeps as I let it go from max to min). They don't fall out, and their low profile is perfect for hiding under my hair or scarf/mask at work. I have used my friend's apple pods pro, and honestly don't see why anyone would spend 200 bucks on those when these are 50 and look better, and sound the same. These are also better than the 50 buck JBL Bluetooth headphones I used to have.I also love the number of tips they include in the package, it made it perfect to find the right size for me. The only downside is that I have a set of tips that are made like silicone earplugs, and if I use those with these headphones the charging case won't close. Makes sense as they are aftermarket, I just keep my preferred TOZO tips on the headphones and keep those earplug tips in a little baggy in my bag for when I work around loud noises.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"Waterproof? What is waterproof about these earbuds? While I was washing my hands the bad fitting earbud came loose and fell into the sink. It was in the water for less than a second before I quickly removed it. I chuckled at the thought of the water possibly doing damage and sarcastically thought ""man, that would sure suck if it broke."" Reassured by that picture on Amazon showing them practically giving them a bath and advertised it as if it did no harm. Thinking I out smarted one of the four main elements I laughed in Poseidon's face. Sadly, I wasn't laughing when after I dried it off and was greeted to the sound of silence. However, it wasn't the song. It was instead nothing more than the sickening sound of a cheap flawed product.",1,1,2020-7-12,1,1,0
I have used couple of different pairs of earbuds including samsung galaxy buds which were really nice. I wanted pair of wireless earbuds to wear in the gym and these make a great choice. I have the tozo t10 as well that are slightly biggee but these are perfect. Initial impressions are great.Music - obviously these cant compete with high end wireless ear buds or over the headphones but for the price they are absoultely great. Bass is really deep but u have to have the buds jammed close to your ear canal.,5,1,2019-9-17,1,0,0
"[UPDATE] - I reached out to the seller who was kind enough to offer me a link to purchase just the charging case for $20.  I decided to cut my losses because at this point I would have spent enough to get a more premium pair and opted to get a set of Galaxy buds instead.  This isn't a knock on the T6, if I hadn't lost the case I'd still be using.  My only issue was around ear fatigue with the tips that kept them in my ears, ergo choosing the buds over sticking with these.I think these are great headphones but I didn't get to thoroughly vet them.  On Day 1, accidentally dropped the charging case getting off my flight, was told I couldn't go check near my seat by the attendant and that I'd have to file a lost & found claim.",4,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I bought the Todo T6 earbuds after my wife bought the T10’s. They are great. I don’t like spending a lot of money on headphones or earbuds in particular. I have spent a decent amount before especially for my gaming headphones. Without getting specific, I have spent between $20 to $350 US dollars on headphones, to give you an idea of what I’ve used and bought before.  I would definitely put the quality of these earbuds on the higher end of that list with the price tag being on the low end. I’m extremely pleased with these earbuds. They have a great amount of bass in my opinion. The music comes in clearly and not distorted. All around great product.",5,1,2020-8-29,1,1,0
"This is my fifth pair of wireless earbuds and these are by far the best. I'm absolutely amazed at the sound quality of them. The last pair of another brand I thought we were very good but these beat them hands down. The overall sound is very rich and the sound is the best I've heard on any earbud. I love the fact that they are wireless charging. That really simplifies things and I can use the same wireless charger that I use on my phone. The case is nice and small, not as small as some but still easy to fit in your pocket. Some people have mentioned  that they are a little hard to get out of the case and my fingers are fairly thick too but I'm not having any problems. I actually prefer these to my over the ear headphones as they are so much more convenient. I can't claim to be a great audiophile but I really recommend these earbuds.",5,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"I received a gift card and was looking for some headphones that didn't have the cord. I've tried a few other pairs and didn't like the way they fit or operated. I saw these and read some reviews and videos others posted. I figured, why not since I won't be spending any of my money for them.When I received them, I was surprised on how easily they paired to my phone (Android) and my Fitbit (Versa 2). After I got the music pumpin through these bad boys, there was no turning back! Awesome sound, the fit is great, they don't fall out and I will definitely be using these moving forward. They come with about 3 other sets of ear sizes, so if the out of the box doesn't work, try the others. For me, the ones that were already on the earbuds worked just fine. I've always had issues with finding the right size, but these are great.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,1,0
"Comfortable and most definitely water proof. I like to watch movies while I take a long, relaxing, steamy shower and these things take it like a champ.They advertise up to 5 hours of battery life, but I have gotten a maximum of 2 hours out of them so far, definitely not happy about that but it was pretty much expected since they're only $40the case says it has about 10 full charges to it, but that is definitely not the case either. Maybe 5 if you're lucky. But again, $40 Bluetooth earbuds, kinda expected that.",4,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
"I just purchased my second set of the TOZO T6 earbuds. I had such a good experience with the first ones that after researching for a second earbud set, I chose the TOZO T6's again. I love all types of music (reggae, rock, metal, techno, electronica, dance, etc.) and especially bass-heavy music and the T6's sound awesome with any type of music. The bass tones are deep and you don't lose the highs either. No, they aren't the same as the high-end earbuds that cost $200 or more but they come VERY CLOSE. Bottom line is, if you can't or simply don't want to spend a lot of money and want great quality sound across all types of music, then these pack a serious punch! I would highly recommend them!",5,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
I will be honest. I had some doubts about these headphones because they are cheap compared to most but damn was I totally wrong. These things sound amazing. I was actually sitting at work listening to music and I kept hearing this noise and I thought it was someone knocking on something come to find out it was just part of the music in the song I have never heard before. The bass it great but not over done. The sound is top notch. The battery life is great. The quality of the case is great. I sit there and flip the lid open and closed all the time so we will see how long it last. The fit in the ear is great. I have a weird shaped ear and one of the ear pieces will certainly work for everyone as it did for me. Highly recommend.,5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"I got these earbuds just for running outside. I was looking for something decent that I wouldn't feel too about about losing. I got them today and was I impressed. The battery case came fully discharged and it took less than 20 minutes to fully charge using the micro USB cable to a wall outlet. Once charged, I took out the earbuds, and they started pairing up right away, and to my iPhone in less than 10 seconds. Sound quality is really good with the right amount of bass and trebles. The buds fit perfectly for me (and there were 5 more sizes that came in the box). You can control everything from the earbuds (volume, play/pause, fast forward, rewind, answer/ignore calls, Siri) . I haven't tested the water resistant capabilities but so far I'm very proud of myself for this purchase.And they look reaaaally cool.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,1,0
"I bought these after searching amazon for good wireless earbuds. I settled on these because of the positive reviews It had received so far and the fact that the T10 model is one of Amazon's bestsellers. I like that the buttons are easy touch, doesn't take a lot of force to tap for pause/play. There are functions to skip/reverse and change the volume by touching the earbuds as well. I found these have a good battery charge and can usually get about 4 hours out of them in one sitting and longer if I am only using one at a time. I get several charges of earbuds in one charge of the case. Less than half the price of well known brands and works really well.  Cons: sometimes difficult to keep in my left ear, may try to switch out the size of earbud and see if it helps. These are not completely noise cancelling, even with the volume up, but it gets the job done. I usually use one at a time anyway. Right bud  skips forward and left bud skips backwards. If you are debating on buying these, do it. You won't regret it.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"So I am the guy that reads reviews, but not real good at going back and righting one. I read reviews and took a chance. So far I can't complain. In the past I have used LG ear buds and paid 2 times the price of these. The LGs keep failing, poor connection with devise, poor quality while using phone, digitizing either me or the person on the other end, and speakers stop working. I drive a lot and need something to keep my hands free. I had come across the TOZO ear buds and decided to take a chance on them, per the reviews and price why not, First impression was great, good quality packaging, opening box one might think they paid alot more than they had, easy instructions and more than enough ear pieces to fit any ear. They are not bulky and fit rather nicely against ear and not standing out from the ear oddly. The touch controls are unique, sometimes a bit easy and other times takes a few times to get it to work, could be me being not used to that feature and not touching properly. The sound is impressive considering the size, it's clear for having a conversation, can be used individually while driving so you can still hear what's going on around you, decent amount of bass for listening to music. There not completely noise canceling but are very close, with volume all the way up the ambient noise around is very faint. Used on an open cab tractor and was barely able to hear engine running at WOT.  The mic, according to the people I talk to, is clearer than anything I've used in the past. So far I am happy with purchase, use them Dailey since purchase with no problems. Fingers crossed to not having any.",5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"I would give these 10 stars if I could. I REALLY love these! I have wanted wireless headphones for a while, but the Apple ones are too expensive and they don’t fit my ears.  I figured I would take a chance on these and I’m so glad I did!  They fit my ears amazing and stay in really well! I really liked that they came with like 6 different sizes of ear pieces (some sizes/shapes I’ve never seen before).  Even on the lower settings they completely block out my kids (super awesome for studying).  The charge also last for hours to get me through my studying or through my class.  I’ve only been using about 2 weeks, so I will update if anything changes, but for now I really love this purchase!",5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0

"I love that I can use one or both of these buds.  The noise cancellation on them is great, I often find that I have to take one out so that I can be aware of my surroundings.  The sound is that good.I love these buds, but having smaller ears makes it hard for them to stay in comfortably for long - that's not the fault of the buds, it's me and my freakishly small adult ears.  It took a little time for me to get used to the touch commands, but once you realize the length and amount of pressure needed to get them to work, it's a breeze.  I gave them to my husband who is also in love with them, and now I'm on the hunt for a pair of smaller buds that will have the same bass and ease of of use like the Tozo T6.  Highly recommend.",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"I've been using these earbuds for a few weeks. I'm impressed at how nicely they fit in my ears and they are primarily used on my laptop for casual gaming. Only had to pair once and they auto-connect after that which is a big plus!  I got weary of going into bluetooth settings each and every time for other hearing devices. Not always, but occasionally, the sound skips as if they are going to lose connectivity. Other times they are fine. I have not found the reason why this is as yet. Overall, I'm quite pleased.June 6, 2020 I reduced my rating from 4 to 3 for this reason. I have used a variety ear plugs over the years but for some reason these cause my ears to itch very badly where the earbuds sit in the ear. I'm thinking the material is possibly sub-par. Other than that I like them but use only occasionally.",3,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"I just received these but if you scan the QR code in the box and write a review, they will offer you a wireless charging base or an extra battery case.  Right out of the box they immediately paired with my iPhone and iPad very quickly. The sound quality is really good while watching Netflix or Amazon Prime. There are six different sizes of earbuds and a micro USB charge cable. The medium size buds fit my ear perfectly. I went outside and mowed the grass and walked the dog while listening to music. I  found these to be extremely lightweight and comfortable. They did not shift around or pop out of my ears.  I will update my review in a few weeks when I’ve had more time with them.  They charge wirelessly too!",5,1,2020-3-1,1,0,1
"I lost my bose wireless earphones so I needed to replacement them but I am not in a position to splurge at this time.  I bought these after seeing a good deal of the reviews and decided to give them a try.  The sound is rather impressive.  I tested them with different genres specially those with heavy bass and no crackling, clear crisp sound, bass is not flat... I'm pleasantly surprised.  I'm able to block out my loud kids for a bit so I can get some work done! We'll see how they hold up.  They came with 4 different ear buds, I switched to a bigger size and so far so good but real test will be when I hit the pavement, hopefully they stay put.  Will update this review as needed.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"I ordered these to use when my husband is watching the news.  Now that we are retired, we are having to adjust to each other's viewing habits and I prefer my news online.I've used headphones for work but never used earbuds for pleasure.

"So I bought other wireless earbuds before that weren't great. The sound quality was horrible and the connection was horrible. So after complaining to my brother he told me about these and said I would love them. So I figured I would try them out. To my absolute surprise they actually worked! Not only do they stay connected to my phone, the battery life and sound quality is phenomenal! What I love the most is you can actually hear the bass in the songs which I never really heard in other brands. I love the color too! :) best money I ever spent on any ear buds! I highly recommend these.",5,1,2020-1-14,1,1,0
"These sound good for the price. In the first hour of use I had 7 super quick drops. Im talking like barely a second long little ""skips"" in the sync. One seemingly random pairing alert. One ""primary"" and one ""secondary"" alert. Then about an hour and a half into use they just shot off, like dead battery shut off. Your mileage may vary.",2,1,2020-9-4,1,2,0
"Great sound quality, terrific bluetooth range, great fit.  The only small issues are that they are a little difficult to get out of the case and it's hard to see which earbud is for which ear (the printing of ""R"" or ""L"" is small and low contrast).  I'd buy these again in a heartbeat.  I use them for exercise, in my hot tub, around the house, everywhere.  I'm not yet sure about battery life - sometimes it seems great and other times they seem to need a charge sooner than I'd think. Probably just me.One other small problem: With the buds in and the music on, I have trouble hearing my spouse talking. Could be a plus or a minus depending on your situation.  :)",5,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0

Sure enough, after I bought him the newer model as a replacement he found his other earbud. He had left it in his jacket and my mom was helping us around the house and did some of our laundry. The earbud was in the pocket of his jacket and my mom washed AND dried it. She found it after she pulled his jacket from the dryer. It not only still worked perfectly, but it still had a full charge also! You can’t beat the quality of these things for the price! I use mine in the shower every night to listen to my podcasts!

"I bought these for 50 bucks, they have amazing reviews. I unpackaged them, put them in, and was really disappointed. It seems like the manufacturers focused on it being totally wireless and nothing else. The sound quality is so poor, and the bass is very poor. If you’re using it for music, do NOT buy. They had decent battery life, probably lasting about 8 or 9 hours. Good noise cancellation. Great for voice calls. Wireless charging was very easy. The sound quality was awful.

"I’ve been using the T10s for a while and found these randomly browsing one day. Checked to see if they were new. Turns out they are technically the successor to the 10’s. A bit confusing given the complete lack of logic around the numbering system. And Tozo’s website makes no sense either and is quite underdeveloped.Make no mistake, though. These are a great follow-up or alternative to the 10s. I’m going to focus my review on a compare and contrast between the T10s and T6s:",5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,1
"This was a decent earbud. Pros: overall, the sound has been clear, and the earbuds fit better than most. Cons: I've had to pair the earbuds a few time after experiencing connection issues. The material used disassembled under 4 months under sendentary conditions. The thin, circular sound screens came off when removing the rubber cushions for cleaning. They seems to have some sticky substance on them, but it lacked durability needed for continual usage. Now, I'm unsure if the earbuds are safe to use without the sound-screens.",2,1,2020-6-26,1,2,1
"After reviewing the T10 vs T6, I decided to go with the T6. The main reason for me, is that I planned to use these headphones to workout, so I wanted the option to skip songs with ease. I don't think that the T10 offer that control option. I typically struggle with in-ear earbuds, because, they fall off after running for a bit. I haven't had this issue with these. I will say that I also purchased the foam earbud tips from New Bee, which fit well with the T6. I think adding foam earbuds help securing the headphones better to the inner ear. The controls on the T6 are a little sensitive, but, it doesn't take a long time to get used to them. The charging case is slick, and small to carry around in your pocket. So far, the charging case also works really well. It typically lasts a few days, before I even have to charge on a wireless charger.",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"Ok, you and I have all bought headphones that promised the world but don't deliver. These promised to be good, definitively as good as they are, but they are so much better.The setup was a breeze and the first song I listened to has one line at the end that is sang in a higher pitch tone. I used to hear it, younger, but can't any longer, that is until I listened with these. There were sounds I didn't hear before. It was like someone who never wore glasses but desperately needed to finally does and see things he never saw before.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"I recently bought the T10 version, but was dissatisfied. There were no controls other than stop/play music and the buttons on the buds were pretty sturdy. On top of that, the connection would get really spotty while I'm listening to music outside. Not sure why it happens only outside. Might be sunlight or wind, or maybe just my phone, but I bought cheap ten dollar ear buds prior and they had no such issue with connection, so I don't get it. Then I realized there is a newer model of these, so I tried for the T6. And wow. This is a mass improvement over the T10. The only thing I can't comment on is the mic quality, since I have yet to test it. The complaints I have are minor, which I will list below.Pros:",5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"You can stop searching for the perfect ear buds now!  I have done much research and the Tozo T6 hits every target area I was searching for.  The case is small and well built, the rose gold is a beautiful iridescent color.  Set up was so very simple.  Buds pair up with each other when removed from the case, Bluetooth pairing was equally as simple.  I have very small ears and the smallest earpiece fits perfect for me.  They are comfortable to wear and are water resistant, can even wear them in the shower if you wish.  They come pre-charged, which is nice.  Great sound quality for the price, so much bang for the buck!  The touch activation is sensitive, the most difficult part is remembering how many times you need to ""touch"" to achieve your goal (volume up, volume down, skip song, etc).  The only think I wish is that there was a distinct visual R and L marked on the ear buds.  However, they seem to work in either ear just fine.Great product, i would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a great pair of reliable earbuds at an equally great price.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"So far, I am greatly enjoying my new bluetooth earbuds. I should mention that I am not tech savvy, so at first I felt like I was all thumbs when getting familiar with this product. I was trying to get information from a brief set of instructions with tiny letters on the inside pages that were really hard to read. Then I went online trying to find answers. Finally, I stumbled upon the TRUE manual that came with the product that was actually very helpful and easy understand. Somehow, I had put it aside and didn't see it. I mention this so that no one else will have this experience.  Once I understood how everything worked, I was impressed on how easy it is to operate these earbuds. So much happens automatically: The ear buds automatically pair as soon as you take them out of the case. They turn off as soon as you put them in the case, and they charge automatically in the case. Once I figured out how to put the earbuds in (again, see the instructions in the manual), the earbuds are extremely comfortable. The sound quality of excellent. It is easy to operate the controls, such as to pause and start again, advance to the next song, etc. Overall, I am very pleased with these earbuds and look forward to many hours of enjoyable listening!",5,1,2020-3-21,1,1,0
"They are small and the case is nice.  They come with several sizes for the ear fittings and that was helpful. The touch controls are easy to use.  Sometimes the earbud will say ""reverse"" and I dont know what that means because its not mentioned anywhere in the instructions that come with them.  They charge quickly and seem to last a long time.  I bought them primarily to use for phone calls and not listening to music.  They work fine for music and have good sound.  They work well for calls but don't do a great job of cancelling out other noise.  My biggest issue is that I have to disconnect/unpair these from whatever device I am using before I can use them with another device.  I wish I could pair them with my phone and ipad and computer all at the same time and just switch easily back and forth without having to go to setting, disconnect and then go to settings for the new device and connect.",4,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"I originally bought the T6 for cutting the lawn and plain listening to music while getting a good work out in. Did they work? They did. Did they some times feel like they were going to fall out due to movements? NOPE! Did they feel like they were coming out due to rain or sweat? Yes and only ONCE THEY FALL OUT. but it was a slow creep out of the ear, so personally I think you can catch it coming out before it falls out. They send you a bunch of different size ear plugs, so what I did is just keep changing them until it felt right and snug without any pain in the ear. Also noticed I prefer a bigger plug on my left ear than on my right ear. So yea mine are different sizes each ear. What did I mean about originally in the beginning... Hmmm. Well I got them for listening to music in various settings, and then got a phone call and picked up just to hold call while I take ear plugs off. The caller then started talking and I respond while only having one plug in. Told them hold on taking Bluetooth off and caller said REALLY I HEAR YOU CLEARLY. Popped the other plug in and continued convo through the T6s. They understood and heard me the whole convo clear as day and surprised me! Surprised me why?, for the price thought the mics weren't going to be good, hence I attempted to take T6 off. Smiled as to money well spent on the T6!Liked them so much am trying out the T12s as the wife is planning on confiscating a pair -_-",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0

The sound quality is good, and I've been listening to music for several hours without having to charge them. One thing I was worried about was them falling out of my ear, but I've done light exercise with them and they stay put in my ear.  Also charging the case is pretty easy, too. Hopefully they last me long.",5,1,2020-3-2,1,1,0
"These are powerful, solid bass, good fidelity on the high end especially considering the price. Simple connectivity and the case wireless charging just plain works. So easy.The touch controls are a bit odd but the do work as listed in the instructions. One tap for pause/play/answer, two for forward or backward (right or left) hold for volume up or down (right or left) three taps for Siri. The odd part about it is when you reverse it takes too long to playback audibly ""reverse"" (which sounds funny the way its said) but by the time it reacts the track will start back at the beginning but it won't respond quick enough a second time to actually go to the previous song so it's pretty much ""restart song"" or go forward. Not a big deal just thought it was odd. Great quality otherwise.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"Like everyone trying to work from home right now, my house is a cluster of half measures and partial solutions. I finally got sick of having a decent pair of headphones with no mic, a good mic with no line out, a good setup that didn't work for phone calls, and so on. I bit the bullet and went with these, and I'm pretty happy with my choice so far.Build: Everything is solid, functional, and the fell is pretty good.

Immediately, I took one of the pods and tried to fit in my ear, and heard, to my surprise, powering on and attempting to connect.  I immediately placed both pods in the sleek charger and hooked up power to get a full charge.  (They were already at 90%+)",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"I have to say for such small speakers they have impeccably clear sound.  I was concerned about the mid-range when ordering them since nothing read mentioned this range.  Typically most headsets either have good highs and lows but lack in the mid-range department (like Bose).  These headphones however are clear across the full spectrum of sound.Not as noise cancelling as I expected, but good enough for my needs.  The touch screens are sensitive but not so over sensitive that brushing against them shuts them off.  The controls take a bit of getting used to due to length of hold times for each particular action.  However, each action is logically divided between right positive actions and left negative actions, and play/pause or call controls using either side.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0

In the car I have had not complaints.Had an issue with music and video sound skipping after about 2 mo of daily use. So far customer service has been great and they claim to be sending me a new pair. Will update with results.",4,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"These are the best bluetooth earbuds I've purchased in a long time.I have another, cheaper, set of Tozo earbuds. And these blow those out of the water. Usually, it's good sound, but people can't hear me, or people can hear me, but the sound is bad.",5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"Call me pleasantly surprised with these.  If you favor a EQ tuning that leans bass and dimmed mids than I think you’ll like them too.  I have some AirPod Pros to compare with and these are actually pretty close which is saying a lot considering the price difference. You could buy almost 5 pairs of these and not worry about losing them.A big difference between the two for me is the passive noise cancellation in the TOZOs vs the active noise cancelling in the AirPods.  The latter being much better for noisy environments.  I will say that the TOZOs fit in the ear quite snug and are about as good as over the ear headphones for passive cancellation.  The Bluetooth range of the AirPods is better too but that’s a non issue if your Bluetooth device (phone) is close by at all times.  The soundstage on the AirPods is also more accurate.  I find the AirPods more comfortable, I think having a stem from the earbud helps balance them in your ear better.  The TOZOs have the weight up top so they feel like they are pushing down and out on your auricle and pinna.",4,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"This was my first step into ""decent"" wireless earbuds, so I didn't have much to compare to. These pair easily, and stay paired. The list of dislikes started coming quickly though, and while each one wasn't a big deal, they added up too quickly and I ended up returning them after about two weeks.* strong magnet holding them in the case - it's a little tricky to get them out of there, especially if you have big hands.",4,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0

"Great color, easy to use and pair, they are indeed water resistant, case charger works great and they have a ton of pieces to adjust perfectly to ear size which are also well made. The only thing is comparatively I did get this replace my beloved geekee ones and they are not as loud or cancel out sound as well as those. That said though they are cheaper then the geekees and they are still very much so worth every penny. Their strong suit would be the pretty design, multitude of possible fits, and seriously after one charge they are already lasted me close to 5 hours. It actually outlasted my phone for a bit there lol. Overall very nice product.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"Initially, I was very impressed with these earbuds. The sound quality is great, pairing is easy, and all touch features work well. However, three things have made up my mind to return these. For one, the max volume is too quite. For most, this may not be an issue, but i need to use the earbuds while playing drums which almost controller completely drowns the sound out. Additionally, the bass isn't where I want it to be. It's by no means bad, but it could definitely use more. Lastly, and most troublesome, the music cuts out when I'm walking and the phone is in my pocket. The bluetooth connection is clearly lacking given that it can't successfully relay from a phone a couple feet away in a pants pocket. This is the biggest issue. If the bluetooth was flawless, i could probably live with these earbuds (better than airpods by a mile anyways).",4,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"The item is actually very good. I purchased & mustve gotten a defective one because ear piece volume was too low in one earbud so returned for an even swap. The 2nd one sent to me which was fulfilled by Amazon was a used one that wasnt in original wrapping. It had a upc sticker over the original upc & when I opened it had hair in the box & ear funk on the ear pieces. It was obviously a used one re-sent out to me. I contacted Amazon & the only answer they gave me was that it came from their own warehouse & not the original supplier. Very unhappy about this! I liked the earbuds & they did work just as it says. Wireless case charging, good bass, very clean mids & highs & call quality very good. The batteries on the buds & case last a very, very long time just like they state also. You cant go wrong with this purchase especially at this price. I gave 3 stars because of Amazon's handling of this as a Prime member. The earbuds are 5 stars tho!!Fyi if you buy these & have an issue just return them to Amazon & re-purchase again so you get it straight from the supplier each time. Dont get grossed out like I did by opening a dirty used item you exchanged for what should've been brand new like I paid for. I cant believe this is how they fulfill for customers.",3,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"This was my first Tozo purchase. I can see why there are so many repeat customers. All those positive reviews for the Tozo T6 earbuds are well deserved.

"Update 1: I've bee using this for a month now and I'm impressed with the quality of sound and battery life as well. I did test this connecting with my laptop and TV as well and it works great. I love the carrying case which is compact and charging is super fast as well. The other day, I watched four-five episodes of Ozark on Netflix with a single charge and it was comfortable. I'll try to post another update after 60 days.What an amazing purchase. While it’s work from home due to COVID-19, I ordered this looking at the reviews and can’t believe it. Paired in less than a min and started using almost immediately. Sound quality is good for the calls. I’ve not yet tried listening to the music but I’m sore it will be fine. Honestly I didn’t want to spend a fortune so bought this and I’m loving it. It’s solve the purpose and fits well in ears. I’d say it’s a must if you are on calls all day like me.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"Absolutely fantastic for the price.I’ve only had them for a day, but again, at the price, the sound is amazing.  All the features required for communications and enjoying your media on the go.

Working on how the buds behave when paired with my laptop and my phone.",4,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"I have tried many bluetooth earbuds in the past. But I have to say dollar for dollar you are not going to find a better sounding earbud for your hard earned money. Nice controlled bass with clean mids and highs ... The sound is not muddled.  Don't bother with those overpriced ""branded"" earbuds that all your friends are wasting their money on. Save yourself a bunch of cash and get the TOZO T6. Lightweight and comfortable with good battery life especially when you factor in the fact that they charge right in the tiny well made storage case ... They are always ready to go when you need them.I changed out the tips to ""Comply"" foam tips but that's not a necessity its just my preference. I haven't tried the wireless charging yet as I don't own a charging pad right now but I will probably get one soon. Until then I just plug in the micro usb into the case and they charge right up. I do have 2 very ""minor"" complaints about the earbuds. #1 .. They can be difficult to remove from the case because they are rather slippery and they really have nothing to grab onto to lift them out (a rubbery finish would have made it easier to access the buds). #2 .. Sometimes I wish they would go a little louder ... The volume is quite sufficient but sometimes you just want to crank it up! But neither of these issues is enough for me to remove a star ... I am very satisfied with my purchase. I bought these to replace another pair of bluetooth earbuds that I thought I had lost. Well I have since found those but I will not be returning these because they sound better than my other pair plus they are much smaller and more comfortable.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"I use these with my Android phone to listen to audio books and to speak on the telephone.  They are comfortable an don't fall out.  There are enough sizes of cushioned pads that every ear size should be covered.  The fidelity is totally adequate for my books and telephone calls.  Music lovers and audiophiles care address more sophisticated details.  The little box is convenient when not wearing.  The buds charge in the box.  The box charges by USB cable or on charging pads.  I haven't worn them in the shower, so can't speak to water proof claim.  Read the directions for controlling the buds. start, stop, answer phone, fast forward, etc.  The pair easily.",5,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
These are good deal for the price. The sound quality is good with what I would call a medium depth and bass. It's not super deep but it's not real tinny.The fit is good. And is fairly comfortable especially if you turn them correctly in your ear. I wear them for multiple hours at a time most days and they don't hurt my ears.,5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"I really would have given them 5 stars because I loved these and use them every day.  However, as of last week, the right earbud will not increase in volume.  It stays at such a low setting, you can barely hear.  So when wearing them, it is like blasting only in my left ear.  Up until last week, I loved these and actually wanted to buy my teenager a set on his upcoming birthday.  The reason I am giving it such a low rating is that I cannot contact the company.  I have tried every email on their website and they get shot back to me stating it's a bad email address.  I purchased these earbuds on March 10, 2020, and used them almost daily until last week.  I'm so sad that they didn't even last 6 months.",1,1,2020-7-9,1,1,0
"Less than thrilled.  Easy pairing and comfortable but the sound is on the tinny side ( not enough bass ), not loud enough and cuts in and out periodically ( when I am literally less than 4' away from music source ) and within 1 hr of training disconnected completely from my laptop.  They're comfortable so I'll keep em, but I would not buy these again.UPDATE: Jan 19, 2020  Took another star off.  Now at a mere 2' away from my music source, these cut out constantly.  I have NEVER had that problem with any other headphones, wired earbuds or wireless earbuds.  For the price I'm rather angry about it.  The only thing these have going for them at this point is they don't hurt my ears but I CANNOT recommend these nor would I buy them again.",2,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"These just arrived yesterday so my experience is limited.  Noise cancellation?  Neighbor mowing yard.  Clearly heard both, mower and sound from ear audio.Without loud background noise the ear buds are amazing.  For my money, they nicely replicate sound.  And they almost pair themselves right out of the box.  I wore them 3 hours with total comfort. The touch controls are intuitive and easy-to-use.  The charger is self contained, securely cradles the earbuds  Charges without any cords!  And its' small size makes it nicely and easily companionable for travel.  I've yet to try them on phone conversation though I anticipate similar satisfaction.",5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"This is my second pair. My daughter wanted AirPods and I saw a bunch of reviews for these and thought, ‘let’s get a pair to try out and if they’re good, we just saved $130’. She wouldn’t hardly let me use them. I bought a second pair so I could actually test them out. They work great.They’re paired to my iPhone and Apple TV. The easiest way to switch sources is to turn off the Bluetooth on the device you don’t want them to connect to. I can use them independently with my phone which allows be to keep on in an ear at all times and have one in the charger. The range is insane — with my phone in the basement if can get a fresh cup of coffee in my kitchen upstairs and never lose connection. Don’t be fooled by the numbers — the T6 is top of the line for TOZO.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"So I’ve had these earbuds since May and this is what I’ve learned over the past month:-The main issue with the tozo earbuds is the Bluetooth connection: often enough to be annoying, the earbuds would randomly experience “link loss” from my iPhone XS. I’d go into Bluetooth settings and they’d immediately reconnect like workers who thought their boss wasn’t looking so they took a break.",3,1,2020-6-30,1,1,0
"My update will change as time goes on. I bought these to run, work on wood projects, and do other hard activities that normally break things like these. Right out of the box they were connected and ready to use in less than 20 seconds. It's a nice sound and good fit so far that hopefully stays in after a 10 or so mile sweaty run. The touch is sensative, so just know if you scratch your ear and brush against the headphones it'll pause them. Also important is the ability to use just one. There's a lot of times I'll have projects to do but also like to have a free ear. These will be perfect for that.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"I want to love these earbuds so much because they come in the *perfect* compact sized case unlike the other brands on Amazon that come in chunky cases, but these earbuds are incredibly difficult to pair with one another. Once one of your earbuds disconnects with the other, it's impossible to try and get them to pair together again. They can disconnect if you leave one in the charging case and one in your ear, or if you don't take both out at the same time for them to pair. I've tried everythng and read all the instructions to try to reconnect them but nothing's worked. I've spent more time troubleshooting this than I normally would because I love the size of the charging case so much so am very bummed they don't connect better together :(",2,1,2020-6-30,1,1,0
"A short time after I returned my original order, I received an email from a company rep. She offered to send me a new set at no cost and asked me to consider a new review after trying the second pair. I agreed. Although this product looks like five star, there are fitting problems that I encountered before. After moving the earbuds around a lot, I was able to obtain a decent but not not secure. Yes, I followed the directions. Sound quality is adequate but lacking bass in a big way. When I looked at a lot of other reviews some people were happy with the bass but didn't sound ""full"" to me. So, good looking product and great company service but don't work all that great for me.",3,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"These wireless headphones are killer. Great value. I just can't read on the devices which is left and which is right because the letters are about half a millimeter tall LOL! If the manufacturer could put a small bump inside the right side unit we can always feel which is the primary and secondary without the audio prompt that gets annoying once connected. Also, the headphones attempt connection and begin playing stuff as soon as you try to pry them from their magnetically attached case. This is also awesome but kinda tricky to pull out if it's night time and your lights are already out. They charge reliably and hold for several hours of play. Awesome gift for that jogger or teen getting introduced to better sound and wireless accessories. I wouldn't sell these to an audiophile because they are used to the 300 dollar and up sound. Beats for them is like meh.",4,1,2020-5-27,1,1,0

"These buds are hard to keep in my ear even after trying different sizes. They also sit awkwardly in the groves of my ears because they’re so big. I’m constantly adjusting them, which pauses my music every time I touch. Very annoying.Other than being large and clunky, I find the buds put too much pressure inside my ear. This makes them too uncomfortable for my liking. Another downside is I can’t talk to people without having to remove them so I can hear my surroundings when music is paused.",2,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"DON'T DO IT! These earbuds look great, the case is exquisite and wireless charging is a real plus BUT the comfort and positioning of the buds is incredibly awkward AND the maximum volume is PATHETIC. I have a pair of Jabra Elite 75t's which are exceptional in every way but I wanted a second pair for my daily treks in the woods with my three rescue pups. I didn't expect that these buds would be comparable due to the price point but they disappoint even still. SO I returned these and purchased ENACFIRE E60's which are truly fine in all categories and are just a tad less wonderful than the Jabra's. VERY COMFORTABLE AND USER FRIENDLY volume control (essential) AND wireless charging. EXCELLENT!!!  :-)",2,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"They’re okay... the sound is good, I like the size. They’re pretty comfortable to wear, although it’s annoying that adjusting them to fit better sometimes causes a skip/pause gesture.  The case is a nice small size that makes these easy to carry around everywhere.The case says it’s wireless charger compatible and I have a generic one from Anker but it doesn’t work on that wireless charger. Also the most bothersome thing is that they’re supposed to turn off when you put them away in the case but mine don’t. They remain on and connected to my phone. I disconnect them using my phone but they don’t turn off and then just die.",3,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"I ordered these wireless headphones to use during zoom calls, and have found them to be so much better than expected. I was hesitant to pay over $100 for something so small, that I would probably lose, so I thought I could try a less expensive model. They work well with my computer. I have also found them to work well for running or stationary biking. They don't seem to slip at all, even when sweaty. The fit right out of the box was perfect, though there were multiple ear inserts. In 6 months, I've never had an issue with battery life. The lights make it very clear what the charge is. I had a small problem with the charging cord, and customer service was fantastic, responding almost immediately with a helpful solution.

"I've been wanting some Samsung Galaxy Buds for a while, but was hesitant to buy them not knowing if I'd like them or use them that often. I found the Tozo's and saw the great reviews and decided I'd go for it for the much cheaper price. I've not had them long, but I'm glad that I did! I know the battery life is supposed to be less than Samsung's, but I'm okay with that for 1/3 the price. Real audiophiles might have some things to say about the sound, but other than the bass not being real loud, I was pretty impressed. It sounded as good as any other headphones I have. I have already used them in a conference call and they said I sounded as well as before with a full headset, I have made a call with it and they sound a bit like being on a speaker phone of course, but was clear and have even hooked it to my TV (which I didn't think of before and is great for not bothering others.) It does not have the app to fine tune things, or really noise cancellation specifically, but I still have to take one out to talk to someone if they don't speak up. As a runner, I don't mind hearing a bit of extra noise, but I'd imagine for those who want it to drown out loud surroundings, it wouldn't be great for that.So overall very pleased with these and the price. If something comes up or they crash, I'll update this.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"The sound is pretty good.  We use them for tablet, phone & pc. Also use them while working out. They stay in ok.  While the touch part is pretty cool, I'm always accidentally touching them and the earbuds register the touch as a command.Last night I was watching a YouTube video on my pc. I would touch the earbud to control the volume, and while I would hear the beeping in my ear, the volume would not change. So either I'm doing it wrong, not sure how, or the commands through the earbud controls don't work well when using a bluetooth adapter/dongle on pc (my pc's bluetooth is mostly broken, so I have to use an adapter).  So just FYI if you have a dongle too.",3,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
I've been using these headphones for about a week. So far I love them! Sound quality is great. It's not really noise canceling but it does block out most sound if you plug it in your ear tight enough. This doesn't bother me as I use these while at work and while I jog and need to be able to hear what's around me. The only thing that I wish was better was the battery life. Battery life doesn't last as long as I'd like but it doesn charge pretty quickly. I havent had any issues with them disconnecting like I've seen in other reviews.  I've left my phone in my office and walked down a completely different hallway with other offices in between and haven't lost connection.  I'm very happy with this product.,5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"I just got a pair of T6 ear buds and so far I am very happy with my purchase. I was surprised to find that the case had any charge in it at all and actually had enough to fully charge the buds.  Both the buds and the case charged very quickly, far quicker than any pair of charging ear phones I've had.  They were super quick to pair, which I'm probably most happy about since I've had several pairs that either took forever to pair or just refused to pair with certain things.On the bad side they like to cut out when I'm not holding my phone which I have them paired with in my hand and seems worse when it's windy. Also the sound level could be better, they don't seem to get too loud, which isn't ideal sometimes if you like listening to music with the volume way up.",4,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
REVISED!!! I used the earbuds one time and they have stopped working. No power apparent at all. I tried contacting the seller for help and after over a week of frustrating and unhelpful emails I got fed up and sent them back and ordered a different brand.Just received these buds yesterday and am happy with the fit and quality so far. I have the older version but like these better due to them being smaller (I have small ears) and seemingly better sound.,1,1,2020-4-20,1,1,0
"This is the third TOZO earbuds I've purchased for my family. I'm really happy with all of them but these are my personal favorite. The sound quality and noise cancellation are great. Stays in my ears especially while I'm working out. It's worth the time to try on the different size earbuds in order to get not only the most comfortable fit, but the correct ones that stay in your ears.I'm using these over my previous earbuds when I'm running errands because the battery case fits nicely in my pocket.",5,1,2020-9-25,1,1,0
"Based on the reviews of the T10 and the longer battery life, I went with the T6. The sound is great for both the T10 & T6, and although they're not true noise-canceling they do a pretty good job, including drowning out a plane engine. The case is slightly larger than the AirPod case, which is a bummer because I'm still looking for a silicone case with a carabiner to be able to hook it to my bag. Still looking. This definitely shouldn't be a deal-killer because the earbuds are worth it.So, what keeps this from being a 5-star product? Unlike other touch devices that require a body part to physically touch the device, I find when I wear a hoodie or wipe my head with a towel at the gym the earbuds are somehow getting touched and they start calling out the commands. I wish there was an app that would allow you to disable the touch feature when necessary. Outside of that, they're awesome!",4,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0

"At the very least pausing should be easy but even that's a pain. You're supposed to tap either earbud one time to pause. But even when it works there's a very noticeable delay between tapping and having the playback actually stop. So sometimes you'll tap-to-pause, wait, wait, decide you must not have tapped it because it's still playing so you tap it again, only now you just skipped to the next chapter/song/podcast. Or you'll tap-to-pause, wait, wait, and wait longer because you don't want to make the same mistake you made last time... only well after feeling pretty stupid you finally tap-to-pause again since it really didn't take the first time. Then you wait....That's just about pausing. I never even try doing anything else, although I often accidentally do them anyway.",2,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
I was so excited for these after reading the reviews. When I first got it they were great no complaints except for the size couldn’t really fit in my ear & they kept falling out. Which I didn’t really mind .... then a day later they just stopped working. The volume is really low & sometimes only one ear decides to work. I also dislike the fact that every time I try to adjust them in my ear it rewinds or fast forwards my music. It’s kind of annoying because it’s extremely sensitive to touch. Honestly just get the real AirPods this was a waste of money. I’m so annoyed,1,1,2020-9-13,1,2,0
"So far I'm loving these earbuds. I am impressed with the sound quality. The bass sounds excellent. The noise cancellation is also great. At work I only use one earbud otherwise I wouldnt be able to hear anyone or anything. The battery life is good. I wear them for 4 hours, put them back in their case when I go to lunch, and continue listening again for another few hours until it's time to go home. The charging case also has a very long battery life. I charged it all night the day I got my earbuds and the battery life of the charging case lasted me about 1 week and a few days until it finally died. The touch capabilities are very sensitive which is good. Overall great product for the price!",5,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0

I wouldn't be worried about it long run except the guide says that tapping the button while in the case can cause a need for reset.

The battery life is great for me but I only use them in short bursts. I’ve dropped these every time I’ve taken them out of the case except once which is really frustrating. Controls work well and they fit well. They’re pretty comfortable too. I’m forever mixing up the left and right and dropping, flinging, etc them when I try to remove them from the case though.  The sound quality isn’t very good and they have to be played loud to hear over workout equipment.  If you want okay sounding headphones that work well and have a decent battery you’ll probably like them.",3,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0

"I waited for about 6 weeks to write this, so that I could get a good period of use in before reviewing. Overall the headphones are a good purchase, and I would (and have) recommend(ed) to my friends and family.Pros:",4,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"I was reimbursed for this product but my opinions of this product is my own.I enjoy this product because it is nice and sleek compared to their TOZO T10. This product is a lot more compact and easier to carry around. However, the downfall is that it did not come with a strap like the previous model did. These last me anywhere from 4-6 hours of consistent use before I need to recharge it with the case again. The Bluetooth range is about 30-40 feet. Currently, the product only comes in Black, but I would like to see it come in more variety of colors. Overall, this product is easy to use and set up, I recommend it to anyone looking for a new pair of wireless headphones to give these a try.",5,1,2019-11-8,1,1,1
"I've never owned wireless headphones before but I'm super happy with these being my first! Compared to regular headphones, these ones actually stay in your ears even while you're sweating! I was so pumped for this. They stayed in, sounded great, and they FIT MY EARS! They come with lots of different size ear pieces for you to try out. Thank god. I've never seen headphones that come with more than 2 ear pieces to try out but these ones did. Overall I've had a super good experience with these working out for the first time. I will happily refer anyone looking for a good pair of wireless headphones to try these ones.",5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"I bought this for working out and listening to music in the hot tube given its IPX8 rating. It has a great sound and it is very convenient that you can control your music with the touch controls, buy they are a little bulky.The good: IPX8 rating allow me to pour water and soap if I take them out my house (which is very convenient in pandemic times), great sound (I compared this with Anker Life P2 and Tozo T6 sounds much better, with fuller sound and more bass), you can play/pause, forward/backward songs and control volume. Price is also a big pro given its funcionality for around 40 bucks.",3,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"So far so good! Lately i cannot seem to wear over the ear headphones. I have worn brands from Bose, to Harman Kardon, to JVC and they all make my ears irriated and ache after less then 40 mins. I suspect something has changed in the materials used or how they are all shaped now, either way i finally needed to find some in ear Headphones.Cue these puppies and so far so good! It is easy to forget you are wearing them and they sound pretty good. They also charge nicely and stay charged.  I am always leery because i do not want to find out they are dead in 3 months or only one ear is working.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
I hardly EVER write a review on an item unless it is so terrible I throw it away!  In this case I admit I was completely blown away!  I paid $200 for my bluetooth Tone headset 3 years ago and although I was very happy with it (before I broke it) I was sceptical of TOZO because of the cost and prepared for the worst.  So glad they came with 4 sizes.  I put on the smallest tip and they fit perfectly!  I don't have to worry about them falling out and the sound is incredible even better than my Tones set.  The only con I have is it is too bad the battery life is 4-5 hours but they do charge quickly and I love the fact I can recharge them in the box without plugging it in!  Happy customer.  I will return to buy more for Christmas gifts!,5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"Great wireless earpods! The sound is good, no complaints. I’m still getting used to the touch controls. I absolutely love that I can wear them in the shower! I listen to my audiobooks when I drive to work and in the shower and these things are amazing! The first time I used a shower cap just in case but now I use them either way. No problems with sound after they were wet!  I haven’t made a phone call with them yet. Definitely make sure you insert then ROTATE the pods to fit your ears properly! Also play around with the included ear tips so you get the best fit. I thought they weren’t fitting right but I just needed to use the smaller ear tips 💁🏾‍♀️ My daughter liked mine so we got her a pair for her birthday.",5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
"I’d have to say these are better than the t10 as far as battery and sound quality. I experienced no connection issues eight the T6. Sometimes with the  others if there wasn’t line of sight you could experience gaps in audio which was inconvenient. But that’s not the case with these. I love the updated low profile charger case that comes with them. They’re easier to stick in your pocket when not in use. The led battery indicator on the charger is better as well. Not to mention that they’re touch controlled now. No longer a physical button. It’s super responsive.The audio that comes from the ear bud when you connect, and have low battery or max volume is nice and clear. She talks a bit slow though lol.",5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"I am updating my review:After a few months of usage, the earbuds go in and out when I use them. The video//music continues to play; however, I can't hear anything. I have noticed this happens regardless of what device I am connected to.",2,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"Great wireless earbuds. They fit snuggly in the ear and do a decent job at passively muffling outside noises (they are not active noise cancellation though.) The sound quality is great for what they are - sub $50 Bluetooth earbuds. Music sounds fairly good through them, especially when compared against other bluetooth earbuds. Battery life is several hours and they recharge quickly in the case, and the case has enough battery to recharge the earbuds several times. The case is a convenient shape that fits well in the pocket. My only concern is the hinge of the lid is quite small that allows the lid to flex more than I'd expect when it's in my pocket, but so far it hasn't caused me any issues.",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"Bought a pair and have been pretty pleased. I use them with my phone and computer all the time. Audio is pretty good and bass works well. I get about 4-5 hours of active use, probably 12 hours of intermittent use, and a few days of recharging with the case. I'd say on the average to above average for quality for $40. My only two minor issues are the touch surface is pretty sensitive (running in the rain caused the audio to increase or decrease since it registered as me holding down the button) and the wireless charging ability in the case blocks out my car keys' RFID keyless sensor if I keep them in the same pocket. I lost one of the headphones at the park today and am buying a second pair.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"I became interested in wireless ear buds through a promotion on a veterans website. The promotion was for another highly rated brand. Even with the promotion, these buds were more than $150.  I found the Tozo T6 buds on the Amazon site. I first found the T10's and then was directed to the T6's. I researched these buds and they were very highly rated on independent sites. The difference between the T6's and T10's, I learned, is the that T6's have a touch pad on each bud to perform various functions rather than mechanical buttons. I compared the specs on the T6's to other highly rated brands. The T6's were waterproof and small. They have a charge case with a built battery. The case can be charged wirelessly. In all, I found no other buds with important features not found in the T6's. I have been using the T6's for two days now and I am very satisfied with the sound and functionality of these buds for phone calls, listening to music, and listening to audiobooks. The only negative I found (and it is a small one) is that it is difficult to distinguish between the left and right bud. They are labeled L and R, but the label is tiny and very hard to read. Since it is important (for functionally) to place each bud in the correct ear, I will find a way to mark one.",5,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"I like the ease of pairing, I like the sound quality, I even like the form factor of the buds and the case. However every few seconds/minutes there is a short pause that goes from right bud to the left bud and sorta sounds like when a CD skips. VERY ANNOYING!Update: I have done a lot of thinking about these earbuds (more then I should tbh) I think what was happening was during the light snow fall I took them in was messing with the touch sensor, because inside they were fine (mostly aside from a short pause every few minutes). However I'm glad I returned them because a touch sensor that is that easily messed with by snow defeats the purpose I need them for.",4,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"I had purchased the best selling Tozo T10 earbuds before with fanatic reviews and T6 is an upgrade in terms of features and technology.  It came with very good packaging and manual to show you how to use the earbuds .  The packaging makes you feel like you are buying a very high end product.  The T6 earbuds give you more controls by touching the left and right earbuds to adjust the music/phone call volumes, pause the music and pick up calls.  Every charge of the T6 earbuds lasts around 6 hours with active use of listening to non stop music.  Pairing is very fast.  Phone calls and microphone volumes are loud and clear.  I have been using it for 1 week and am loving it so much.  The quality of the earbuds and charging can case is top notch.  The sound quality to me is comparable to the 200+ Bose wireless headphones with very good tremble and bass.  If you have used Tozo T10 earbuds before, you will not be disappointed with the quality and the new touching features of the T6.  I would definitely recommend people to buy this headset instead of other slightly cheaper headsets that don’t have the same comparable sound and made quality.",5,1,2019-9-27,1,1,1
"So i've had these for about 5 months now and i'm 100% satisfied. Bluetooth connection has always been quick and the only time i've had any connection issues was with a cheap $30 mp3 player, so the problem was the mp3 player itself. I was reluctant to, but I went on ahead and tested these in the shower and they really are waterproof and continued to do their thing. I don't do it anymore, but it's nice to know the build quality allows it.I only use these in the morning and at the gym at night, but i've never had them die on me, I charge the case on a Qi pad once or twice a week. I have them in right now listening to a hip hop playlist on spotify and the sound quality is great. The bass kicks in pretty nicely. I honestly think these are more than worth the current price.",5,1,2020-3-2,1,1,0
"I wanted to like these but ended up sending back. Getting them out of the carrier is a bit of a pain. They paired fine, but the sound quality of one of the buds was intermittent. If I held it in my ear just right, the volume would be fine, but once I let go, it went silent. Paired and unpaired an handful of times and finally got it to work most of the time. The sound quality is decent for what they are. They were pretty painful both from a fit and from the noise cancellation. Touch sensors are kind of a catch 22. They are essential to have, but every time you put one or the other in, different commands were being sent. Fine for a run probably, but not if you have to take them out periodically.",3,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"Got these for the wife on mother's day. She likes to listen to podcasts in the shower. They work GREAT!! good sound for small package, and water proof. Charging case is well made and QI Wireless Charging is AWESOME!I have a beautiful pair of Sony WH-1000MX2. These do not compare as far as sound quality.  but I will say they sound MUCH better than my Skull Candy wired earbuds for $20. The noise isolation is fantastic!  Add charging case, touch controls, QI Wireless Charging, small case AND they sound better than SC earbuds. extremely hard to beat for the price. I use mine for yard work and podcasts.",5,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
I love these! My first pair and I did Alot of research on them all. I didn't need Alot of bass but this gives all around sound just great! People can hear me talking on them and don't complain about the noise in the background which is nice! The only thing I need to get used to is the tapping. They are very sensitive but I have plenty of time to learn. I love the rose gold color & the case & I also bought the Tozo wireless charger with it which just charged my case up super fast! I've had them for a week so far and never had to charge the ear buds or the case but the case was missing a light so I wanted to see how long it would take.I'm super satisfied with them! Now my cat can't chew up my headphones cords anymore!,4,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
"I only purchased these a few days ago in preparation for a trip. I just tried a cheap pair of wired ear buds (in-ear) to see how comfy they’d be and when I realized how much I had missed out on by not using this type of ear bud, I was in awe. I felt really stupid... Why did I not try this kind before? The wired ones are fantastic (different brand) but  changing into my pajamas while dealing with the wire made me I decide to try these wireless ones. If the tip was just a tiny bit smaller, they’d be perfect! Regardless, with one of the many little tips they come with, I found a set that are really comfortable and form a good seal for the best sound. My ear canals are super small and very sensitive, so I’m extra happy I don’t have to return these. I do wear earplugs for sleeping every night because I’m such a light sleeper, so I’m used to having those in my ears. These might not be as comfy for some people that don’t want stuff in their ears. However, I’m loving the freedom of wireless! I’m really looking forward to using them on my vacation, but even more excited that when I’m stocking tomorrow at work, I can wear one and listen to music. *happy dance*I love the touch buttons! Because I’m sensitive, I didn’t want to press hard on a button. Just lightly touching these works great! Only downside is you really can’t put your head against something, but I don’t sleep with music on anyway so it’s not a problem for me.",5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0

"I was hesitant to buy these because my ears are somewhat small. I thought they may fall out or be uncomfortable during jogging. However, they stay in place surprisingly well! Pairing is super easy, the sound quality is really nice, and the button-less interface is nice-tap to pause, double tap to skip ahead, hold for volume. The case is great. It’s compact and the buds magnetically lock in place to charge. I saw reviews stating the buds were difficult to remove, but I haven’t had any issue at all in that area. I definitely recommend as an alternative to airpods in terms of price, functionality, and appearance.",4,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"I have been searching for a set of good quality earbuds at an affordable price.  Having a Samsumg Galaxy S8 phone,  I had looked at Samsung Galaxy buds, Jabra elites, and even the Echo Ear buds.  I just couldn't bring myself to drop $129 on headphones.  I was mostly looking to use them at work (Office Job) to listen to some music and podcasts/audiobooks.  I honestly listen to more books/podcasts than music so I didn't really care about having ""deep bass"" or anything like that.  I stumbled upon these bad boys and pulled the trigger.  I am very glad I did.  They seem very well made, both the buds and the case.  They offer great features like volume and track control from the earbud.  They can be charged wirelessly, which I think you have to pay extra for an AirPod case that does that.  Better life is pretty good and they are waterproof! My wife loves them and doesn't even use them because I started listening to my podcasts in the morning while I shower with these, so she doesn't have to hear it any more blaring from my phone speaker.  They come with tons of different tips to fit different size ears.  I got them with a 20% off couple, so I paid 39.99 for them.  I would have been satisfied at full price, which at this time is 49.99.  With the features, quality, and sound, these are an A+ at this price point.  I almost forgot. I don't do a lot of calls on them, but the few calls I have take on them have been great.  The other person could hear me just fine and I had no distortion on my end. About the only thing I haven't tested is the range, so I can't speak for that.  If your considering them, I'd absolutely recommend giving them a shot.  They are a good quality, versatile earbud.  Hope this helps someone!",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
"Fantastic sound! For the money, they're amazing. They sound better than any wired buds I've used. Battery life is as good as stated, & range is great. I left my phone on the charger when the battery was low, & I was able to do chores all over the house and even in the garage without losing the connection. My wife has a pair of Galaxy Buds+ that she loves, so I ordered a pair myself, that I wanted to love. The Galaxy buds were very comfortable, & had great battery life, but didn't sound great, & noise canceling wasn't great...so I returned them. I'd been wanting an inexpensive pair for mowing my lawn, chores, etc, a pair that if I lost them, it wouldn't be catastrophic, so I gave these a try and I'm so happy I did! While they may be waterproof, I wouldn't wear them in the shower again. They worked, but every time water drops hit the buds, since they're touch sensitive, they would skip forward, backwards, etc. Other than that, they're fantastic. I would still love them at twice the price, they're so much better (for me) than the Galaxy buds that I returned.",5,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
"I wanted wireless earbuds to work out in. I saw this and it looked pretty. I bought it and when I got it I tested it out (jumping around, running) to see if it would fall. It didn't. I used it at the gym and it stayed in. It was a bit sensitive though, my hair touches it and it pauses the music. But after using it for a few days, it just didn't stay in place anymore. It's probably me because I'm just not used to earbuds, but I had to return them because I just didn't see me using them anymore.  I think if you are used to earbuds like these that rest inside your ear then its good product but if you're using it for the first time then I think it might be a bit hard to get used to. Its a great product, its nice looking and it works really well, great for anybody's budget, but it just didn't appeal to me after a few days.",4,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"These headphones are hands down the best quality that you can get for the price and sound. At only $65 (compared to $200+ for big brands) they not only meet, but exceed the quality of other big name headphones. I have owned many different types of earbuds but these are my absolute favorite. This company does a wonderful job with their products, and I’ve had no problems with any of their work. I originally bought the first model of earbuds, the T10s and loved them. When they came out with this newer model, I knew I had to give them a try, and when I received them, I quickly figured out just how awesome they are.One really cool thing about TOZO’s products is that they come with a FREE one year warranty. This is a big deal for me because if I’m buying something, I want to know that it will last me a long time.

They've been very solid for all of that.The carrying case makes carrying them convenient, and keeps them well charged, which is very convenient, and there's never any doubt for me about them dying.

Do not buy this product at all.Update: After almost a year now, they found about the review on this product, and are attempting to make it right.

"Wanted something that wouldn't fall out of my ears and could you be paired easily, without paying extravagantly. Have used these for over a month now without any complains. They paired easily with Android, and apple phones and with a laptop. Have used them for calls without any issues. The range is great and they have an inbuilt microphone so you can actually move around and take calls without any drop in quality. At this price I'm not sure you can get an in-built mic with earbuds. The battery life is great and the charging case fits easily in my pocket. The have some good controls on the earbuds too, you can use them to skip, pause/play, end or answer calls. Especially useful if you use them while working out. They really don't fall out at all and have fairly good noise cancellation. Really can't think of any cons. Haven't tested them in water but based on other reviews it looks like they would fair pretty well.",5,1,2019-12-25,1,1,0
"I did have the earlier version of these earbuds but, Tozo has made a few improvements with the T6. The sound quality is MUCH better and not so loud as the older version. The ear buds fit very snug in your ear. I work out heavy on the treadmill and they have not fallen out on me once. I have had them for a few weeks now. If you put them in as described in the instructions, they are fine. You can fast forward or reverse at the touch of the ear bud on the upper outside of the device.  They do give a comfortable fit. I had no problem pairing them with my iPhone. The charging container is streamlined and takes very little time to charge on a pad. It does hold its charge for well over a few hours. I am quite happy with these ear buds at the price I paid.",5,1,2019-9-28,1,0,0
"First of all, especially for the price, these things sound great.  They were easy to pair with my phone (Samsung Galaxy S9).  With the buds that came on the earbuds, they fit snug in my ears (though had to wiggle the left one a bit to stay in my ear).  The bass response is really good.  The one thing that is a bit annoying is the controls.  Because they are touch, it is really easy to tap without tapping or to tap the wrong thing because you are not sure where to tap (do not have eyes on the side of my head :) ).  I also found that if your fingers are a little slick, the ear buds can be a bit difficult to get out of the case.  As to what these are like after a period of time, I will have to see.",4,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"Well, for 6 weeks,  I loved these.  Fit my ears and sound quality was surprisingly excellent.  However, then 1 side volume reduced by 50 percent, so stereo effect is pretty much gone.  I can find no way to contact the manufacturer and it would be useless anyway.  Learned my lesson - dont try to skimp on things like this.Update: without asking (because the vendor saw my review here) I received a brand new set of earbuds and they are working perfectly.

"I cannot believe how good these earbuds are. I have had at least 6 other pairs, all of which were well known brand names. To me, these outclass them all. The price was less than $50 bucks! Upon opening the box, you can immediately see and feel the quality of these. Mine came fully charged and ready to go. They last about 6 hours between charges. The charging box has approximately 3 full charges so I've never been without a a power source throughout the day. They drop very easily into the box with a very pleasing magnetic pop. The sound is well balanced with a perfect blend of highs, mids, and very powerful bass. Some brands advertise deep base and most of the time, it downs out the other sounds. Not with these! I honestly could not be happier with a pair of buds than I am with these. If you are on the fence about these, take the leap. They come with an 18 month warranty and for 6 dollars more, you can get the Amazon 3 year warranty which was a no brainer for me. They connect easy to everything I've tried in less than 2 seconds. It comes work a total of 4 different size tips for all ear sizes. Amazing product and most certainly I will purchase from Tozo again!",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0

I never tried Apple's ear id's because they didn't fit in my ears. These come with various sizes for the part that goes in your ear and fit perfectly.

The buds cancel out the noise while she's in her Zoom classes from me teaching in the room beside her. Since they're wireless, she doesn't have to worry about getting caught up in the wires as she's transitioning from one activity to the other. I highly recommend these for any virtual learner.  I'm so grateful that this company stands behind their products.I purchased the pink buds for my 14 year old daughter. She complained that the left earbud never stayed charged as long as the right.

I put them earbuds in my pocket and forgot them. They went through a full 1.5 hour wash cycle and the dryer before I realized.

I have also tried Jabra elite 65t and others that were less expensive.  Admittedly, I was slow to choose the Tozo brand, as they are priced a lot lower.  After reviewing many different products I decided on Tozo and am glad I did.Out of the case, they pair together perfectly and quick.  The sound is clear and noise canceling.  In fact, around the house, I only wear one or  I can't hear when someone is talking to me. Maybe I should turn down the volume.  I have used them in the shower with no problems.  I exercise in the gym 3 or 4 times a week and have not had any issues with sweating.  The T6 earbuds stay in place, don't lose any sound quality and are light to wear.",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"This is my second set of these earbuds, as I expected my wife commandeered my first pair. I don't know which pair is the newest release but the second pair came with fewer earpieces. I don't know that it really matters because we each are able to achieve a good fit. Still amazed by the sound quality, I use Abracadabra by Steve Miller Band to evaluate the stereo capability of headphones. The track switches channels left to right several times so you can get a good feel of the stereo effect. These earbuds do very well. They are not promoted as being noise canceling but the fit is tight enough to do a better job than many that advertise noise canceling.

"The are a fantastic set of wireless earbuds. They are smaller than most. I typically fall asleep in bed listening to music on my phone.  These are small enough to actually lie on and not hurt my ears. In addition, you can easily wear one earbud and keep the other in the case. Why? In my case I can listen to music or YouTube and not be cut off. Earbuds that permit outside noise to come in are still to isolating when you are sitting and having coffee with someone while browsing, reading, occasionally listening, and having light conversation. The sound quality is very neutral and detailed.Two last remarks-1.  the touch controls are simple and easy to execute, and 2. You actually get wireless charging and a waterproof case. I destroyed my Jabra 65Ts leaving them in my pants, killing the case.  You cannot go wrong with this product.",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"These are the first true wireless earbuds I’ve owned, so I don’t have a lot to compare them to.....But I absolutely love these!!  I’ve always had to have the type of earbuds that have some type of mechanism to secure them in my ears without falling out.  Unlike the AirPods....tried my boyfriends and they would not stay in my ears.  These have several sizes fit your ears.  They are sweat resistant and don’t fall out...great during work outs.  You can use one or both.  They automatically connect to your phone when taken out of the charger.  If you’re using one and take out the second, it automatically connects and disconnects when you put it back.  They charge wirelessly.  Touch controls for Siri, forward, reverse, answering calls, and power on/off.  Love, love, love these.  Will probably buy my boyfriend a pair since his AirPods are in the fritz!!",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"Now that I finally have an iPhone, I needed blue tooth earbuds.  I simply could not justify the cost of the Apple earbuds... knowing how frequently people lose them.  After hours of reviewing other brands, I kept coming back to Tozo... so I gave this a try.  They are amazing... great sound... both for hearing and transmitting... so much so, that when I have worn them while multitasking - people on the other end have complained about the noise in the background being too loud (ie - unloading a dishwasher or rolling a garbage can up the driveway).  I got the T6 in  pink (but do wish they were more rose gold vs. pale pink). I have never had an issue with battery life or recharging.  They sync nicely across all my devices & have used them with my computer for video conferencing...much more pleasant to look at than everyone with their corded headsets!  Often, I just use one for phone calls and it is enough.  I highly recommend the Tozo T6 earbuds!",5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"Ok so I never thought I'd ever buy earbuds for my phone...but I was browsing amazon and found these. I was always worried that buds that were this ""cheap in price"" would be not even worth buying. I was completely wrong. These earbuds are, like the headline says, surprisingly awesome. Here's my breakdown.1.Comfortability: I definitely didn't expect the buds to come with 6 pairs of bud fittings! Originally I went with the stock fittings, but they were a little too big for my ears. went one size down and they are perfect. I barely notice them in my ears now. Great job!  5/5 for options.",5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"I really love these earbuds!! The extra silicones help you find the right size for the earbuds to stay securely in your ear without falling out which makes these earbuds great for working out and running. You can also use them in the shower, but they are pretty sensitive to touch so it’s a little annoying. The sound quality, volume, and noise cancellation is really great. They connect to my iPhone as soon as i take them out of the wireless charging case. The battery life also lasts a long time with the help of the case. I was worried these earbuds would be really bulky and stick out a lot but they’re actually pretty small and lowkey so they don’t look bad at all, unlike the silly look of the apple AirPods. I accidentally dropped my left earbud down the sink and it was stuck in a gross pool of dirty goo and water for about an hour. When I recovered and vigorously cleaned it, the volume and touch abilities weren’t working so I thought for sure it was totaled, but after tapping it violently for a while it started working again and stills works perfectly now!! I really couldn’t believe it. Anyways, these earbuds will definitely last a long time. I am really happy with this purchase :))",4,1,2020-1-1,1,1,1
The only negative is the manual is printed in very very tiny text.  I will making zoomed in copies tomorrow.  There is a lot of functionality in the Touch Control on each earbud.  Powering on and pairing happens automatically after removing from the charger.  If you try to adjust the ear buds placement in the ear you might increase volume or you might decrease the volume or you might forward a track or you might reverse a track or you might power off.  THere is a learning curve here and I think small hands would help.  5 stars because these are smarter than myself.,5,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
As someone who suffers from arthritis of the thumbs its impossible to get the ear buds out. I used small pieces of bandaid and stuck them on as grip pads. Simple and now no problem getting them out while keeping them paired.Aside from the arthritis issue I love these. It does have trouble if my phone is in the other room but it's far enough for me. Noise cancellation is good. I can hear things but not all sounds. All in all great buds!,4,1,2020-3-21,1,1,1
"Okay, I was just looking for a nice pair of wireless earbuds, i didn't expect what i got.  I LOVE my bass, the more bass the better... These things exceeded every other earbud I've ever tried!  WOW!!! I thought i was wearing my Sony Extra Bass headphones when i heard the sound quality from these little earbuds.  Totally impressed me!  The fit is nice, the case is nice... Holds enough charge to recharge the earbuds once you do drain them, while your in the road... Now the touch control takes a little too get used to, but...WOW, these things are the best, and the cost is nothing compared to the quality you get from them!  If your looking for some earbuds, don't waste another day without them... Just blown away!",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"Product is “ok”. 2 star because I think my older “Enacfire E18s” I’m replacing (due to low battery life from age/use) have better sound quality and fit in my ear better. Also the wireless charging worked for the first week, hasn’t worked since. Contemplating returning..Edit 5/6/2020 - Increased to 3 star for the seller contacting me to send a replacement because they think I got defective product. I'll update again after the new ones come in",4,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"It was a pretty good experience while they worked. For the price it really does shine. Problem is I am a heavy sweater when I exercise, and I exercise often. I gave these a shot to see how water resistant they actually are. But alas, they couldn’t last due to my profuse sweating when I jog. They endured valiantly, but 7 months is all they could do before the right ear bud died. If you aren’t a heavy sweater, I’m sure these will last fine. But if you are someone who wants a set that can endure sweating. Look elsewhere.",1,1,2020-9-22,1,1,0
"I have bought a lasuney t30, tozo 10, and enacfire E60, but these by far are the best option of these 3, the second one would be the tozo 10, then the t30, and E60 as last. These earbuds are smaller than the t10, they fit better, the battery life has improved a lot. The sound, the sound is amazing, for me is the best combination in bass (a lot) with mediums and low, I can hear clearly every instrument, voice, with an amazing quality. The case is hard, is a quality plastic and feels solid. I just use these earbuds to listen to music, I can't give my opinion with calls.",5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"Honestly, I did not expect much from these, but they greatly exceeded my expectations! They're super adorable and the color is a very soft pink, love it! I have a petite F and do have small ears and use the smallest plug. It fits perfectly and doesn't slip out. The trick is to lightly twist it into your ear and angle it like it does in the photos. Make sure to wipe the buds every time you take it out, NOT doing so can cause them to slip out easily. I love the sound, I love the easy controls, & the charging case is very sturdy and holds charge well (24 hrs). I wore one of the earbuds for 5 hours and the battery was about ~70%, not bad for using only one! I might get my boyfriend one as he was really impressed with mine. He did order from another more well-known brand so we could compare, but it's definitely comparable to his $130 pair.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"Bought 2 pairs: one for myself and the other for my son. Easy to use and easy to pair with multiple devices. The accommodating ear pieces are perfect to get the right, tight fit for your ears. My son uses it daily for his workouts and he LOVES them. They fit comfortably in his ear and the sound quality is great. I use them for bike riding, running, paddle boarding, hiking, and just anytime around the house. I had a bit of trouble working the features, but the handy instruction guide is helpful ... keep it. The battery life is fantastic! Previous owned earbuds didn't have the battery life this has; and, THAT, is a plus! I would definitely look at this brand again should I have to purchase another.",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"I generally spend the day working Outside and have both hands busy.  Being able to use my phone completely hands free, while at the same time, listen to my favorite Pod Cast is a must.  These earbuds are the best set I have had to date, I have gone through several others over the years. The comfort is great. The touch sensor one the ear bud is amazing. Be patient and learn the touch commands for pause, rewind, fast forward, call answer and disconnect,  to get the full use and functionality  out of them. Each side works independently of the other in all functions or simultaneously together. The battery life in every other set I have previously owned was a max of about 2 hours despite what manufacturers claimed.  These on the other hand each last for about 7 hours of continuous play. The last pair I had lost volume strength over time to where I could barely hear the right side. These sounds better to me than the Apple Air pods and keep me going all day.",5,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0
"I was in the market for a new pair of earbuds and came across a bunch of recommendations for Tozo brand. After some research I decided on the T6 model and am very happy with my decision.I’m very impressed with how great these earbuds sound. The pairing process was extremely easy. Most importantly I have small ear canals that make AirPod style extremely uncomfortable, these earbuds come with 6 different sizes for the rubber caps. As expected the smallest size fits great and is very comfortable in my small ears even during long periods of time. The 18 month warranty is awesome too.",5,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0
"Like a lot others I purchased the older Tozo 10. I found them very hard to pair and while the sound quality was excellent,  the battery was always charging, even after the buds were at full.  These Tozo 6 buds are far beyond the first. They connect together in seconds and move to the pairing step without prompting.  Connects and plays without fuss. Word of caution,  I purchased the black ones and about 30 minutes ago, one fell out onto the floor and under the stove.. I just found it in  a small opening but it was nearly impossible to see. Get the white or (cringe) pink ones and save the eye and back ache.",5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"I receive this earplugs and they seem pretty solid, very easy to set up and pair I started listening to music but I'm not sure if I receive a defective unit but the sound seems off, especially when I'm listening to my audiobooks, that is mainly why I bought them there is some echo and sizzling when listening to people talk... I wish they were like an equalizer app for the earplugs to see if its a software problem rather than hardware.But all and all I have no problem with them and kinda like them. Pretty solid for the price.",4,1,2019-12-11,1,0,1
"Pretty dope little earbuds. Pairing is so simple. Honestly, I have purchased two pairs- black for myself, rose for my lady. Compared to AirPods these are much more comfortable and a fraction of the price! Sound quality is pretty damn good for the price point. No true noise-cancellation, but what do you expect at this price-point? I like heavy low-end sound and these deliver that when digitally equalized. I think this is some kind of back-engineered “sleeper” design (maybe Samsung- better than Apple) product. 1,000+ hours of use and the battery case/buds are still just as good as they were on day one. I mostly charge them with Qi. Would recommend to all! They’re a steal!",5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"Sometimes you buy something cheaper than the super popular product (AirPods) and you come to regret it pretty fast. That's not the case here. There are absolutely some nice things that the AirPods Pro in particular have that these do not (like passthrough of audio) but those are five times the price of these.These hold a charge well, have good audio prompts to let you know when they are active and when they are connected to your device (an iPhone 11 Pro Max in my case), and when there is the very rare link loss. I use these twice daily for long dog walks and don't have connection problems at all for probably six out of seven days. When I do, it's usually solved by pulling my phone out of my pocket, restarting the audio, or turning Bluetooth off and then back on. So usually within a few seconds it's good again and I won't even think about it for a week. With an hour or so of daily use, I have to charge the case every three weeks or so but that's with me usually using only one earbud at a time because I want to be able to hear my environment well while walking the dog.",5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"I just received this product today, but so far it is wonderful. I bought it to replace my Apple AirPods. The sound of on the AirPods became so low I could barely hear them and after trying everything to get them back to the normal volume, I gave up. So I took a chance and bought this product, for $40.00 I figured it was worth trying them out. So far I am very impressed with them, the paired with my various bluetooth device very easily. So I am wondering why anyone would pay for the overpriced Apple product. But I will have to give them more time and I will write a follow up review after I had them a while logger.",5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"Update:So the left earbud has very little sound now. I've tried turning up the volume and it says it's at Max volume. I'm very disappointed because when they are a pair, they're very good. With only one working earbud, I reduced my rating to 2 stars. I've had these for less than a year and don't use them that often. I'm disappointed that in so short a time, they stopped working well.",2,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
I just received these earbuds today so I can only speak to my experience so far. I love these earbuds much more than I expected too. The fit is perfect. I haven’t needed to use the other ear tips provided. The sound is amazing. The battery meets expectations. I like that I could leave my device in one room while I roamed all around the house without losing connection. I’m considering getting a back up pair.Update: I’ve had these for 6 weeks now and I have to say that it’s one of the best purchases I’ve made. I use them every day. The battery life lasts for hours. I’d buy another set if I could. I am so pleased with these ears buds. They are easy to use and the fit is great. I definitely recommend these ear buds.,4,1,2020-1-25,1,1,0
"Likes:  Sound Quality, bass, case, easy pairing, waterproof, wireless charging, price/performance (5 star), fitDislikes:  Touchy controls (take a few time to get used to them), one pair had the volume significantly lower than the other so exchanged it on Amazon.  Would like noise cancelling. Instructions are not so great. I would definitely recommend these.",5,1,2019-12-10,1,1,0
"Whoa, I have had these headphones for going on....10 minutes. Opened them up, started to open the instructions to get them set up which is always a bit of a hassle with bluetooth but nothing that can't be handled. No, by the time I had the instructions open they had already turned on and were trying to connect to the phone so all I had to do was select them. Immediately they're good to go, great features for volume, song forwarding, answering, and voice assistant right on the buds. I love Apple, but there's no way I'm blowing 300 on earbuds so this felt like a solid second place, but I can't tell a difference in the quality and now I'm living my best wire-free life. If you've had any inclination of needing wireless, these are the ones to get! As for the additional silicone inserts - they do give a lot of options but my ears must be weird shaped because I've never been able to have buds stay in with any movement so I was thrilled to be able to pair the with my Yurbud covers and don't have a care in the world now that there's no chance of them falling out.

"I originally purchased the Jabra 65 Elite Active 65t based on all the so-called professional reviews.  Immediately returned them due to really tiny sound. Considered buying the Jabra 75t, but lots of reviews complain about an unbalanced amount of bass.  Decided to instead purchase the Tozo T6 based on all the strong consumer reviews (which I wondered if all were legit given how good they were for an unknown brand).  Used the Tozo T6s yesterday for running and they were great. Sound quality is way better than the Jabra's -- particularly in the mid-range but also the bass.  And they are about 1/3 the price.  They stayed in my ears during running, which I was somewhat worried about (I have largish ears).  Buying a second pair for my son.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
Sorry for the initial run-on sentence...If you like having two things to juggle that you will probably drop while jamming (which you will end up doing to get the position right for good audio quality) and removing them from your ear canals possibly having wax on them but definitely pushing wax further into your ear canal all while looking really silly when they are in your ears then these are for you. Oh and did I mention the pain that even the smallest covers on the these can cause? I could also mention that the touch control mechanism is always an accident waiting to happen and does happen.,1,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"Delivered quickly and easy to set up. I was thrilled by the many tip options to best fit my ears. Turns out the original ones on the earbuds were perfect! Everything was packaged very securely and seemed to be great quality, especially for the price. I’m very pleasantly surprised by the voice quality for these headphones. The speaker on my phone isn’t doing too well, so I ordered these to improve my phone calls and podcast listening experience. Very pleased with how clear everything is. I haven’t worn headphones in so long and these are so comfortable, I feel like the music and podcasts are streaming directly into my brain.",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"These earbuds have great sound quality, the bass is surprisingly good!

"These sound not much different from Airpods but are only a fraction of the price. I was surprised at the sound quality. If sound quality is what you are concerned about, rest assured that it delivers far beyond what you would expect from $50 wireless earbuds. Will buy again for my mom.EDIT: The right earbud stopped working after less than 3 months, the light blinks red and it's not able to hold a charge anymore and the light blinks even when it's in the charging case. I contacted TOZO and it was fixed surprisingly quickly. As long as they work, these are worth more than what they cost, period. Sound quality is about on par with airpods. 5/5 recommended.",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"I could not get these headphones to stay in my ears after trying every single size of earbud included. I was impressed with how many different sizes were included, but I just can’t get them to stay in my ears at the gym. The battery life is an absolute dream. I think I’ve charged them twice since I’ve had them the past couple of months. After leaving a bad review, the company contacted me and offered to send me their newest model free of charge. I’m not sure if I’ll accept because the product itself is quite good, it’s the earbud covers that just don’t work. I’m not sure that’s something that can be fixed. 5 stars mostly due to customer service response, but headphones are a great value if you don’t have issues with earbuds staying in your ears.",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0

Still ok for me, as I’m just using them as I walk around the neighborhood. I’m not sure I’d be able to use them in a gym, if they ever open again lol.  Not sure if I have a defective pair or not. Oh well.",2,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0

My only problem is that I seem to be one of those people that technology doesn't like....when I try to use the controls on the actual earbud, it doesn't work most of the time, so I just use the controls on my phone.  (I've had this problem with other devices not reading my fingerprint)One issue that I've had is when I lay on a towel after swimming, if the earbud is pressed against the towel, the earbuds act like it's a fingerprint.  So, it may up the volume or skip a song depending on which ear it is.  Very annoying.",4,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"The earbuds are packed really nicely and the little box they arrive in is truly tasteful and is very convenient to carry around. However, noise cancelling they are not, far from it actually. And most importantly, the sounds quality is non existent: there is no bass whatsoever. So if you are buying for a kid, yeah, may be, but for an adult who knows what headphones should sound like - no, they won't cut it. I couldn't handle the horrible sound for one minute, immediately put my original Apple headset back.

"I recently had the JB Under Armour Flash earbuds which retail for about 3x what the Tozo's are. I HATED them! They would never stay paired with my phone, they constantly fell out of my ears, so on. I sold them and I've only been using the Tozo earbuds for a few days but in comparison so far I LOVE them. The very first thing that impressed me was that they synched up within seconds! SECONDS.  They're small and lightweight. They stay put. The sound is amazing. I love that you can skip, rewind, pause/play and change the volume all from just touching the earbud, although it does take some getting used to. The noise cancellation isn't fantastic but I have a 6 yr old so I don't necessarily need to completely cancel him out! lol So that's ok for me. I think these little things are a gem! Oh and the charging case is so small, you could toss it in your pocket or anywhere! And personally I LOVE all things pink...so that was the deciding factor for me! Win Win!!",5,1,2020-5-1,1,1,0
These are absolutely wonderful! And the price makes them even better!I read a review on here before I bought them that you can only wear and/or recharge the right earbud with the left still in the case but you can't do so with the left earbud while the right is in the case; that is completely FALSE!,5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"These look good, sound good, feel good, are easy to charge, are fun to pop in and out of the case, and worked very well at first.  But in the last several weeks that I've been using them, I've found the Bluetooth radio to be of exceedingly poor quality.  The buds will regularly spontaneously disconnect from my phone while it remains in my pocket, and now they're at the point that they do not reconnect to my phone when I remove them from the case unless I unpair and forget them from the phone's Bluetooth menu entirely and then re-pair them.  Quite a shame, because I was really enjoying them up to this point.",3,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"I bought these to replace a set of Bluetooth headphones that died after 2 years of use. I wanted to get something completely wireless since the ones i used before still had a wire. After some looking around an amazon these had good reviews and i decided to give them a try. I am not disappointed, there quality is really good and with the features of touch screen on the side vs buttons, which most headphones have, they feel really high tech. Just tapping on the sides does a large variety of features like pause music, go back or forward a track, and answer a phone call. They also fit very nicely in the ear, muscle memory causes me to push them into my ear as though they fall out but every time i do they are as snug as i had put them in. Finally, they have a nice charging case with them so they wont get lost or damaged and keep them charged everywhere. You can charge it with a standard phone wire and with a wireless one which i have not tested since i don't own one. Overall, i say these are a buy especially if your in the market like me of needing to replace some old ones and want to upgrade to a good price for real wireless headphones with amazing quality.",5,1,2019-11-18,1,0,1

The sound worked briefly in both ear buds but the right one cut out, however the short time I experienced sound in both earbuds it was crisp and clear. They have a nice weight to them they do not feel or look cheap at all. I really appreciate the lights on the front as I’ve had earbuds in the past that don’t have this feature.

"For wireless earbuds, these sure do pack a lot into a little package! (Relative to other earbuds) has excellent sound, actual battery life of 5+ hours between charging, and allows you to use one side at a time instead of requiring both to be connected like other versions. The charging case is a perfect compact shape, and offers wireless charging. So, my ONLY complaint with these is the ""touch buttons"" on each earbuds. This is used for functions like raise & lower volume, skip track forward or back, and open Google Assistant or Siri. That is all awesome, BUT the button is WAYYY too sensitive. I constantly find myself randomly listening to a new track, or jumping to random parts, by accidentally brushing up against one.Other than that, seller is very responsive to issues that come up, and very fair.

Convenient tap controls on earphones to control your music and volume work very well. Charging case will charge on a charger pad, which is handy. Overall, a high recommendation for those who don’t want to drop $100+ on headphones.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,1,0
"I'm a big fan of my AirPods, but after having them for a couple of years the battery life has dwindled to maybe an hour at best. I really didn't like the idea of spending another $160 just because the battery had worn out so I started looking around for alternatives. So far the Tozo T6s have been pretty great. The case is almost as small as the AirPods case which is important since I like to throw my headphones in my jacket pocket and not really think about whether or not I always have them with me. The area where the T6s really outshine the AirPods is in the sound department though.  It is a huge, night and day difference, with the T6s offering much more bass, clarity and overall volume, mostly due to their in-ear design I would imagine. I haven't had a chance to test out how waterproof they are, but they seem very well built so I imagine they are true to their word about that. Another great bonus: wireless charging! I was so disappointed when the new AirPods included this but upgrading to the new case cost $80! These include a wireless charging case AND the actual headphones themselves for less $$$ than that.",5,1,2019-11-13,1,0,1
"These Earbuds were great and price and the sound quality was great. Only problem was after using it twice, the right ear bud stopped working.... I got in contact with customer service and surprisingly, recieved a response the next day. They will be sending me a new ear bud replacement free of charge! It's great to have a product that the company stands behind if somethings wrong. Will update again when I receive the replacement.UPDATE 3/11/20",3,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
Actually super impressed.. I was literally about to buy the Apple Air Pods when I decided to take a look at what amazon had to offer. Noticed that these had the best reviews and wanted to give these a try before breaking the bank for some earphones. I am so happy I did. These have amazing sound quality. It has bass and 100% noise cancellation! I literally cannot hear anything or anyone while I have them on lol. The battery lasts a very long time! So the first day I didn’t know how to turn them off and apparently I left them “on” not playing music but just like not in “off mode” and realized the next day when I went to put them on they were already in the on setting and figured they would be dead within minutes so I used them for a few hours and to my surprise never died. When I went to put them to charge they actually were still fully charged! The back of the case has a little light bar thingy that has like 6 dots to show how charged they are and it was only down 1 little dot even after using them for a few hours after being on for a full day and I was very impressed.. so I would 100% recommend these to anyone !,5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"Don't waste your money on expensive name brands. I've always bought wired headphones that are bottom of the line. This is the first time I've actually bought myself a descent pair of headphones, let alone wireless earbuds.Very pleasantly surprised.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,1,0
"The Tozo T6 sound quality should more than enough for the average person. The charging case closes with a magnetic click and each earbud lights up to show they're connected. They're comfortable to wear and provided with 5 different sized ear tips. The earbuds connect to bluetooth within 1-3 seconds on my smartphone and laptop. Overall, I'm very satisfied and it's difficult to find better wireless earbuds within this price range.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,2,0
"I’ve owned these for about 6-weeks, as time goes on I like them less and less. Pros- great at noise cancellation, charging case is compact and works very similar to AirPods, the touch feature is nice, they can be recharged wirelessly or with the included cord, sound quality is very good, they are sweat and water resistant (supposedly could swim laps with them but not submerge), and cost is reasonable. Cons- I have small ears and liked the variety of coverings available  to fit different sized ears, however I cannot find a size that will stay in my ear completely while running and I find them all to be uncomfortable. I’m constantly having to adjust them. Touch control- anytime I adjust them in my ears I bump this and alters the playback mode I’m also still having difficulties trying to do the correct taps for forward/ backwards/ and volume control. , I also like to swim so I decided to try out the water resistance in the shower- the water seems to “touch” the ear piece and adjusts the volume to increase or decrease or stop play altogether, I cannot imagine trying to actually swim in them, battery life started out great but now the charging case seems to be trying to charge the ear buds constantly (as the charging light never goes off) and then the ear buds don’t work three days after charging (without any use), when the battery dies it seems to forget how to connect to my device after a recharging so I have to find the device and start all over after every charging which is frustrating when you’re about to go for a run.",3,1,2020-5-12,1,0,1
"Bought these after losing my previous pair. Sound quality is good (once you find the earpiece that fits well). Bass response is good, doesn’t seem to be any distortion. Several rubber earpieces are included so it shouldn’t be difficult or take much time to find a pair that fits. Battery life is good, mine last 4-5 hours and re-charge fairly quickly. I haven’t noticed how well the noise cancelling feature works but once I fit them to my ear, I was able to use them very effectively as sound protection in my wood shop around very loud power tools (as well as listening to music).",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0

With reservations.The advertising says they are IPX8 waterproof and they are BUT you can NOT wear them in the show as they suggest. The warm water activates the touch sensors and they go berserk. The volume either climbs or falls uncontrollably and the power turns on and off.,3,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0

"Works great, good battery life, water resistant,  and the sound quality is real nice.UPDATE - Ended up running in the rain and mic went out.  Thinking not a big deal, I registered them using the included warranty card and they are advertised as waterproof. Contacted TOZO via FB messenger (seems to work alot better than emailing) and they had me go through some steps of resetting in hopes it would return my buds back to full functionality but, unfortunately it did not. Once we went through the steps they offered to replace my T6 buds as the warranty claimed they would.  Very happy TOZO stands behind their product.  I would recommend these ear buds as they do work great and now with the experience of customer service can't ask for more.  Thanks TOZO!",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"I had the previous version the T10. Wow..! I was shocked at how good it was. Now, with T10 , they have made bigger strides. The sound has a bit more bass. It is as crisp as the T10. The battery I would say easily lasts over 5 to 6 hrs. The case is small, I fight to pull out the earbuds from it. I have average male fingers, but getting the earbuds out is a pain. I wish there was a tab or cutout on the side to lip the buds out. The touch function works flawless. Overall, I love it. I would not hesitate to spend twice as much and buy again. This one blows all other earbuds away..!I have been using this earbuds for sometime now and these are perfect!. I was able to use this for long hours without getting ear pain. Sound quality is absolutely amazing and its very easy to carry in your pocket while traveling. I highly recommend this product.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,1
"For the price they are very good earbuds. However given their physical design it’s a little difficult to grab the buds out of the case. Also when trying to put the buds in and out of your ear often your finger touches the print controls which inadvertently reversed, forward, or initiate other commands while trying to fit them into your ear. Also getting the volume to control from your phone flaked out a few times where you could not raise or lower the volume unless you did a factory reset or put them back in the case to turn them off and then take them back out to turn them on then the volume on your phone such as mind using an iPhone worked again to raise or lower the volume in increments. When using the touchpad feature on the earbuds there is a control to increase volume but none to decrease volume. Also the on and off feature does not always work properly when touching them. Overall they are a little smaller than the previous version which was the T 10 but still think they could’ve done a little better job on the form factor to fit inside ear lobes a little better.",3,1,2019-10-16,1,1,0
"I lost my airpods and was given these... They seem to work fine for men, but even using the smallest fitting, they fall out of my ears, and so no matter how good they may ""work"" I cannot use them!

"My really good sound intone cx-05 headphones broke and I was looking for a wireless earbud replacement for them, the glowing and innumerous reviews of this product had me excited and had me under the presumption that the sound quality would be really good- at least on par with airpods (note- I have never listened to airpods but have been told they are terrific). The glowing reviews of this product had me quivering in anticipation. I even paid extra for one-day shipping so I could get my hands on them as soon as possible.Now I just want to return them. I don't know if it's the way I'm putting them in my ear or what, but these things kinda suck. Don't get me wrong, they're not awful; I'd happily take them over 20$ gas station headphones. But I was very very disappointed with the sound quality when I took them out of the box and fired them up. The bass is laughably puny, honestly.",3,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"🥰🥰🥰😍😍 I LOVE THEM❣❣❣. Ok where do I start. They came on time. They were already charged to 100%. Super easy to connect and operate. The operation instructions are simple to follow. THEY ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO TOUCH❣❣❣. The sound quality is soooo clear. Also,, it does extremely well with noise cancelations. I'm not sure if that's a feature. I have read through all the features. I stopped reading and was sold when I saw you could touch them. Then saw they had a high star rating..lol 🤷🏽‍♀️. Best money I've spent on Bluetooth earbuds. I will be buying more as Christmas gifts.",5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,1
"I was hesitant to buy these because I usually get the more expensive brands but I'm so glad I got them.  They are comfy, super light, and sound great.

I almost lost them twice down a drain.",2,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"The earbuds came in today. The color (rose gold) is very pretty. The earbuds and case charged very quickly. The pairing to my cellphone was seemless. The music volume can get very loud (since I don't like anything too loud in my ear I keep it down to a volume comfortable for me) but it is super clear as are my test conversations. I havent tested the distance, battery life, water resistance, nor the ability to remain in my ear during workouts as of yet but again this is day one. Time will tell on all of that stuff but as of right now the buds get my vote.",5,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0
"So I specifically wanted to write a review for this product because of why I initially got them. I have small ears and my ear canals are a smaller in size as well. These are great! They came with several different sized ear tips and that, alone, is why I gave 5 stars. It’s such a struggle to find ear phones that will work perfectly for my ears, so I give my recommendation on this. The packaging was very clean and simple, the product as a whole is well worth the money.",5,1,2020-3-4,1,2,0
"I've owned three different pairs of earbuds from three different brands and they've always been just missing the mark. Maybe it was because it was a few years ago and the technology wasn't there yet but I found myself eventually going back to my wired headphones. As soon as you open the box and hold the earbuds and charging case, you can tell it is sturdy and well made. I also love the fact that they automatically turn on when you put them in the charger and automatically turn on and sync when you take them out... super convenient! As far as the sound quality, it is very clear when on the phone and the person on the other end can actually hear me! I was especially impressed by the noise cancellation. The music was the same. It was nice to be able to listen and not have outside noise disturb you. So far, I'm happy with these earbuds. I'll update if anything comes up that I feel is relevant.",5,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
"Bought these for the wife for exercise, and they don't fall out from activity. They fit her perfect right out of the box so no need for the extra ear pieces, but nice to have if switch users.The sound is very good and comparable to the Klipsch wired ear buds she has now, which is on the border of amazing. They are noise-cancelling only in the aspect of the fit in the ear, but do cut out a lot of extra noise.",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
"I was in search for a replacement to my corded ear phones.  I wanted the best so my first instinct was to go with the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Plus as it was compared favorable with Apple's offering. (Note: I'm not an Apple person so that was never a consideration.)  I almost bought the Galaxy Buds...but then came across the T6 from a company called TOZO.  I'm not an adventurous person when it comes to purchasing from an unknown source, but after watching several video reviews, I took the chance.  After a month of athletic use (gym, running), my only concern is what to do with the extra $100 I saved.  Very satisfied with this product.  Very easy to use.  Great battery life, connects effortlessly.  I also bought their Wireless Charger which makes recharging a snap.  Highly recommend this product.",5,1,2020-7-19,1,1,0
"Functionality is great. They pair really easily. I previously had a different set made by a different brand that I always had trouble pairing to my phone. Much better experience with these. They work great for calls...crystal clear. I also really like the size of the charging case... nice & small... easy to fit in a pocket. I would say that the only drawback to them is the volume... if you’re looking for something that gets really  loud & has a lot of base, these will be a disappointment. But for every day use while I’m walking around the neighborhood & want a volume where I can still be aware of my surroundings, these are perfect.",4,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"These aren't perfect but I really like them.  The positives are the ease of pairing them with devices, the quality of the sound, the ease of charging.  The negatives include the max volume not being as loud as you would imagine, the buds are a little challenging to get out of the case.  I paid fifty bucks for these. They are a super deal at the sale price.",4,1,2020-7-28,1,1,0
"I was really excited to receive my headphones since this is my first time owning wireless ear buds, but as soon as they arrived and were fully charged I noticed several problems. First, volume control was a big hassle- they arrived turned to full volume, and when following the instructions in the pamphlet to lower the volume I found that it didn't work, and simply turned the device off. The touch feature was also ridiculously sensitive and my music would frequently pause or turn on Cortana without me even touching them. In addition, the buds became frequently out of sync despite being fully charged, and played delayed sound out of the right side. These headphones are also really uncomfortable, despite the amount of extra ear cushions included- the exterior of the bud made the outside of my ears sore after a short period of time, and stuck out at an awkward angle, making them not very inconspicuous.All and all, I'm just really disappointed and I'll be returning them.",2,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"So if you’re on here looking at reviews, take they with a light heart. In order to get a 1 - year warranty on the headphones you have to review them within the first 14 days of your purchase.I am willing to bet almost all of these reviews are within 14 days of the purchase, but I’ll come back and edit my review if my opinion changes over the long hall.",4,1,2020-1-31,1,1,0
"These don't pretend to be some name brand super sound earbuds, but what these forty-dollar earbuds do is impressive. The Bluetooth 5 connectivity is splendid and far-ranging. The controls are simple and effective (they won't pause automatically when you take one out, but it's easy to tap the earbud once as you take it out of your ear). The fit is fine, even for a couple hours of use,  but don't anticipate a four-hour listening session. If you were to attempt that, though, they would probably last; the battery life is excellent on these, and the charging case supplies refuels whenever you're not wearing them. That battery is also powering some fair audio, and even though I am no audiophile, I was pleased by the reproduction of my favorite bass-heavy tracks.If you want splendid buds at a *very* good price, these are the ones.",5,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0

I am very thankful for that, since my wife now has fully working buds!I bought these for my wife for when she runs. She loves these! The sound is fantastic and they stay firmly in her ears. The only drawback, about 2 weeks ago, the left ear piece stopped taking a charge for some reason. I'm not sure what happened, but it's very frustrating.",5,1,2020-2-23,1,1,0

I always have issues with ear buds and like an idiot thought this was the magical one! Cool case I personally had a little bit of an issue getting them out but nothing to cry about. I must have the pickiest ears ever because after an hour or so I popped them out I as moving the first time. The next time it was me scrunching my face to scratch my nose and I almost lost one for good! So... I only wear them when I’m in my garden or inside because if it pops out I’ll find it. I don’t recommend if you have issues with ear buds period. Not miracle but great noise cancellation when it was in. A little sensitive but great sound can’t be too far from phone though.,3,1,2019-12-24,1,1,0

"This is my second pair of Tozo wireless earbuds.  I have a pair of T10s that I bought 4 months ago and they also sound great, but for some reason they would keep cutting out when paired to my cell phone.  They have no issue with my chromebook or tv.  So I purchased these T6 as part of a promotion, to see if they would cut out with my cell phone also, being the same manufacturer.  I'm happy to say that they do not cut out.  I was able to do all the yard work, mowing, trimming and blowing and they didn't cut out once.  Wireless earbuds are great instead of having wires get caught on stuff.  Sound quality is great.

"Like a lot of people, I don't tend to spend money on myself for this kind of gear. After all, for listening to audio books and podcasts you don't need really good headphones. However once you see how easy the TOZO T6 wireless headphones are to use, you will wonder why you waited. The sync right up to the iPhone and I can switch between the iPad and IPhone fairly easily. They work great with just one earbud in for audiobooks, and the pause feature is very convenient. Sound quality is great without disconnecting you totally from the world around you. Best of all is the convenience of not having a lot of dangling headphone cords while you bike or walk around. Once you go wireless it will be hard to deal with standard wired headphones again. They are a great value compared to the competition, and their Support has been responsive and helpful. Well Recommended.",5,1,2020-6-15,1,1,0
"The T6 earbuds are lightweight and comfortable and an excellent bargain compared to other name brands. The design of the case adds value because of the wireless charging feature. The earbuds are also magnetically held in the case which keeps them from falling out. They are lightweight and I tried and couldn't get them to fall out. I plan on using them while exercising and might even try them on the golf course :) They came very smartly packaged with additional sizes to fit your ear canal, but the standard ones fit nicely. The touch feature on the sides to pause play is very convenient. Lots of technology packed into a small package at a very competitive price.  Sound is great and I'm not sure how you can get much more out of such a small, portable,  lightweight design. If you're looking for total immersion and full noise cancellation, you probably need over the ear big headsets. Theses do a pretty good job and are more than enough for me. I like the fact I can touch them to pause, and have a conversation without taking them out and when I turn them back on, I cant hear much but very very loud noises. Definitely top of the list because of wireless charging case, quality, and price.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
I love the charging case and how If you want to turn off the headphones you simply put them back into the case and they start charging and “go to sleep” if you will...they are basically a sensibly priced and sleeker looking version of the Apple Air Pods in my opinion and thanks the the silicone part of the buds they fit comfortably in my ears and I can wear them when I ride my electric bike to work going upwards of 30mps and I don’t find myself being paranoid that they are going to fall out and be lost or break...they’re so comfortable that it’s easy to forget that they’re even in. Another nice thing is they’re very discreet so if you want to just turn on one and wear a beanie you can get away with wearing one when it would look bad to do so like at a boring outdoor work conference or a soccer game. It’s very convenient how if you only want to use one of the buds you can simply only remove the one you want from the charging case and the other one stays off and charging in its case. The connected seamlessly with my iPhone XR and I was able to sync them on the first try with minimal effort which is also nice...some headphones take a while and multiple attempts before you’re ready to go! Finally I would recommend this product because of how nicely they are for making phone calls. If you’re looking for a Bluetooth headset for making calls for business these work every bit as well as your classic Bluetooth headset and you don’t look like a douche hah.,5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,1
"First, these earphones/buds fulfill the necessity of staying comfortably in my small ears. I will be able to wear them more comfortably than my around the ear Bluetooth wired earphones when using ear protection muffs for loud routine (non-dangerous) shop work.

I wanted to make sure that the cover for the charger was being set aside properly; not pictured in the instructions.

Both the Tozo T6 (newer) and T10 (older) are great earbuds and I've recommended to several friends. Focusing here on a comparison between them.The T6 is almost unnoticeably smaller and the charging case is a nicer form factor. The sound quality is about the same.,5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"Not waterproof. I never intended to swim with these but once just to see if they were in fact waterproof I tried showering with them, and though they didn't seem to be damaged by contact with water, the water triggered the touch pads and my music started skipping, or my voice command feature on my phone was activated because of this.  also sometimes the touch pads are triggered in the rain which causes my music to skip or the volume to change.  this is disappointing as these were specifically advertised as waterproof, however 99% of the time it's not an issue for me because I don't really use them much in the rain or swimming. But if that's what you're looking for these will probably not work for you and really should not be advertised as waterproof.Other than that qualm however, I've been very satisfied with these headphones. They're comfortable to wear, have decent sound, and as a phone headset they get excellent sound quality.

"I have had many sets of Bluetooth headphones, and I have never had a set more finicky or difficult to control than this one. Every time I pull them out of the carrying case, rather than reconnecting to my phone automatically, I have to repair them. If I want to have both of them paired, I have to unpair them, then pull both out of the carrying case, then pair them together.Added to this is the ridiculous touch controls. I've read through the instructions and spent about fifteen minutes trying to turn up the volume, pause, play, fast forward; all the things you'd expect to be able to do. All I can do reliably is tap to pause. Everything else is luck - I'll more often skip ahead or reverse than actually turn the volume up or down. Also, the functionality of having only one earbud turn up the volume and the other turn it down makes that functionality useless in any scenario where I can only wear one earbud.",2,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"Bought these because the reviews were great, and I agree the sound is absolutely amazing from such small devices.However, I can’t keep them in my ears! They come with multiple ear piece sizes to help you adjust them for your ears but despite trying them all they don’t stay securely in. I had one sitting on my ear nicely for a few minutes, next thing I know it’s falling out.",2,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
"I love these earbuds! They really do cancel the noise around me so I wouldn't wear them while walking in public or on the street. The bass really improves the music and I try to find every little chance to play music with the things on! They're great!They also last for a really long time and since I received them last wednesday.and charged them, I charged them again last nite for the first time.",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
These arrived yesterday.  I needed replacement for some lost JLab earbuds.  This is the first time I have ever owned true wireless earbuds and was nervous spending $50 on something I wasn't sure was going to work for me.  My nervousness stemmed from not knowing if these would stay in my ears.  My main usage for them is during yardwork.  They need to be heard over my lawn mower.They arrived with an over 90% charge which was nice.  The tips that were preinstalled fit great.  I put them in and shook my head and there was NO movement.  I was very happy about that.  The sound was loud and clear.  The bass was better than any earbuds I've ever owned.  I do have some nice over the ear headphones that sound better.,4,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"I purchased these to replace a broken pair. I couldn't be happier that my old ones broke. The Tozos are so much more comfortable. The bass really surprised me too. It wasn't something I experienced with my previous set, which I paid the same amount for.If there is a negative it is how well the noise cancelling works. I use them for work and I need to be able to hear, but the fact that the left side only plays if it is it of the cradle allows me to wear only the right side when I need to here.",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"We ordered three of these. Two worked. On the third, the two ear buds wouldn't pair together. Reset them several times and only one ear bud would work at at time. Returned it and a new one was sent. The new one doesn't work either!! Sending it back. The two that work are great but it it's hit or miss if you will receive a defective item.",1,1,2020-2-20,1,2,0
"Loving these bluetooth earbuds! After reading loads of reviews, I decided to bite the bullet and buy these. Wasn't sure if they were going to be worth it due to the low cost, but OMG they are SO. WORTH. IT! I've been using them all day for conference calls, music and podcasts while at work with only minimal battery drain. They fit my ears perfectly, especially after switching out the silicone shields one size up. I even found myself wearing them with no sound simply due to the fit and ability to cancel the sound of coworkers on their speaker phones in their offices. While the touch control features take a little learning curve, I've had no issues pairing & connecting the buds between my iPhone, desktop iMac and Macbook Air, and switching back & forth between the three devices. Also, I'm very picky about what I use for listening to music, normally just using my wired earbuds. These have now officially replaced them for normal use.  My son, who is a musician, tried them out this morning and is now begging for a pair to replace his normal earbuds. Don't bother with Apple earbuds, get these!!! Anxious to see just how long they last. Thank you Tozo! Fantastic product!",5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"Good set of wireless buds for the price. These have been my favorite earbuds since the tozo t10. They sound great and fit my ear nicely. The case is about the same size as airpod case.  They have been used in water and never failed but if water was touching the side sensor it would think I was pressing it and pause the music. Wireless charging works great! I have never charger it via the cable. My main issue with these earbuds is when using them for a phone call, people complain about not being able to hear me good and the hear alot of background noise. For the price, definitely a solid pair of earbuds.",4,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
These earbuds do the trick for a much better price than the expensive brands.Sound quality is decent if you can maneuver the buds into our ears to block out the outside noise.,4,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"For the price, these earbuds are hard to beat. Pairing them to my phone and laptop was surprisingly easy. They appear to be very well made. Most importantly: 1) they are comfortable 2) the sound quality is excellent 3) I've been told the same holds true of the mic quality also. The other features (wireless charging case, waterproof design, volume control) are icing on the cake. At this price point, they are well worth it.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,1,0
"I've had these for 9 months and they've been really great until now. Now my left side earbud just blinks continuously and rapidly half the time when I put it back into the charger.  I even updated the firmware on them and it still does it.  And now after the update my right side ear bud is super quiet!.  Anyway, the left ear bud is completely non-responsive if the light is still blinking fast before pulling it out of the charger.  Every now and then it will work but its a crap shoot. I also cleaned the two small metal contacts which only made a slight difference.I'll try to contact TOZO and see if they will do the right thing and replace it/them. But I'm really not happy about the buds only lasting 9 months and having problems.  :(",5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
"The TOZO T6 is a decent set overall. The fit is comfortable for the buds itself. It comes with 4 sets of earbud tips of various sizes, which is nice. Unfortunately for me, none of the tips are comfortable and a bit too stiff in my ears to where they hurt. I used the tips of an old pair of headphones and used them as substitute.I think the sound is amazing, and I am heard clearly according to anyone I have talked to on the phone while utilizing them. However, when I am in call with someone or video chatting I noticed if I open another app, it will disconnect to whomever I talk to and I have to reconnect. The same applies if I want to listen to music, but play a game. It will disconnect and play neither. It's a bit of a hinderance in that aspect and I wished there was a way you could hear everything you have going on rather than disconnecting constantly when you have more than one app going. At that point I would rather use my wired set.",3,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"Okay, here's my update.  Must have done something wrong or it must have been a fluke.  I LOVE these ear buds and they are worth the money.  Initially, I thought the battery life was terrible, but either I didn't have them fully charged (I assumed I did at the time) or it was a one time problem.  They are extremely comfortable and in fact I have them in my ears all the time, and the controls are adequate.Pros",5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"My wife asked for me to buy her some wireless bluetooth earbuds, so I began researching.  I listened to my friends airpods and was impressed with the sound, so I began looking at reviews on those as well as other quality ""name"" brands.  I was expecting to spend well over $100 for a pair.  I saw these on Amazon, and they were on sale for $50.  I would normally not bother looking at a pair so inexpensive, but I noticed the extremely good reviews by so many reviewers.  I bought 2 pairs.  One for me and one for the wife, and we are absolutely loving these!  The sound quality is incredible, and the bass sounds so full, punchy mids, and crystalline highs.  They paired immediately with our Samsung phones, and neither of us have had them drop  connection once.  Listening to them at work I got up from my desk, walked out the door and over to the next building.  I was 10 ft into the building before the music stopped, and I realized I had left my phone on the desk.  They immediately paired back up when I was between the buildings.  Another favorite place to listen is in the shower cuz they are absolutely unfazed by the water even when washing hair!  The touch controls for stopping/starting/advancing music work excellently as well as taking calls.  Callers have commented that the sound quality is excellent on their end, and it is great on my end as well.  The build quality on the buds and the case appear outstanding as well.  Perfect size and form and just the right amount of heft.  And the case recharges the buds as well!  There are magnets that hold the buds inside the case for charging which is a nice touch.  Streaming music non-stop and with some calls in between, these will last 5.5 hrs.  I havent yet figured out how fast they recharge when put in the case.  Each night I put them on my wireless recharging pad so its fresh for the next day.  I've let several people try them out and after listening to them I tell them how much they cost and they are incredulous!  After owning these, I really think Apple and the other big brands are ripping us off.  I have been recommending these to all my family, friends & co-workers, and I gladly recommend them to you!  If there were only one thing I would change, it would be that when you are on a phone call, you can hear the person you're speaking with just fine in both ear buds, but when you speak, you don't hear yourself in the ear buds (the person on the other end does fine, tho) and its a little weird not knowing how loud or quiet you sound to them.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"All right, I’ve only got it for a day and I’ll point out the things that I noticed from the start.• The case and earphones feels pretty solid. There’s weight to it, and they feel similar to normal earphones with cords. The case has a magnet on the center to latch it closed. It might be strong enough to stay closed in your pockets, but it may open if you have small pockets like women jeans pockets.",2,1,2020-7-24,1,0,1
"For the price you cannot beat the quality. Sounds comparable to other more expensive sets I’ve owned. I’m ready to try the gym................(UPDATE 3/4/2020) ok so I’ve been going to the gym nearly every day. Running on the weekends when the weather allows.  The verdict is in.  For the price you cannot beat these.  The sound is pretty good compared to higher end earbuds.  I’ve had skull candy, Beats, several off brand from retail chains, black web.  Do they sound as good as the beats? Close not as loud though. Skull candy? Crushed them.  The others not even close.  Water resistant claim has so far lived up to the rating.  I sweat like the devil in church even at a brisk walk in the winter. The beats shorted out due to my profuse sweating.  Ladies and gentlemen for the price you will not find a better pair of true wireless headphones.  Prove me wrong  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️+⭐️ I don’t do that often Tozo",5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"I ordered the pink pair of TOZO T6, which is cute and pretty for a girl in her 20s. It's also pretty close to the skin color, so people can barely notice that I'm actually wearing earphones, that's awesome. I like to listen to music on my way to work and especially on a subway, these earbuds make me completely separate from the outside noisy world! But be careful to wear it when you are walking or crossing the road! The cancellation of noise is so good but it's a little bit over good, since sometimes our ears need to breathe the fresh air. Well, all in all great purchase, especially the beautiful pink color added my review from four star to five star!",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"This is the fourth bluetooth I've tried and I like the way it fits into my ears without feeling like it's going to fall out.  The sound quality is another trait that made my decision easier.

Able to stay connected throughout the apartment as well as outside.",4,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
"During the Covid-19 pandemic, I worked from home a LOT!  I needed Bluetooth capability that had a good microphone and was comfortable in my ears (I have very small ear canals).  I tried 4 other type of ""brand"" Bluetooth earbuds prior to buying these.  Loved them so much - my husband just bought a pair.  He has been using LG Tones and just switched to these.  Can't say enough good things about them.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,1,0
"These earbuds are probably the best wireless earbuds you can get for the price. TOZO did a great job with the build quality. They feel super premium with a nice weight and feel. The charging case comparable in size to Apple Earpods, so it isn't too bulky and the magnetic lid means you don't have to worry about it opening accidently. The sound quality on these earbuds is great, they produce clear, crisp mids with both strong base and treble performance. The IPX8 water resistance means that you won't ever have to worry about getting these things wet, whether it be rain, sweat, or in the shower. The touch controls are also very nice as they allow you to control the volume, pause/play, and go forward or backward through your music.I am very happy with my purchase! These are fantastic earbuds for the price if you need a pair for the gym, your commute or just everyday listening.",5,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"Sound quality for me was okay. But the volume level straight up sucks. My wife was sitting next to me listening to something on her phone and I could barely hear what I was listening to. Tried all the different sizes that other people had said and nope, volume level still sucks. Should have paid the money for the Raycons I wanted. To my surprise Tozo reached out and addressed my complaint. Just received my replacements today and will give an update after a day to check them out. Customer service is reason for changing rating.",4,1,2020-5-11,1,1,0
"I wasn’t expecting these to sound as amazing as they do. I compared them next to my Powerbeats that I use to workout with and they absolutely put them to shame! Crushed them, no comparison. The highs and mids are CRISP and the bass is tight and deep. Giggity. I would describe myself as somewhat of an audiophile, but not full-fledged as I’ve been a professional musician for most of my life. Overall, I would these as having a very well balanced and developed sound. Fit and sound are the most important things *for me* to consider. These fit my ears very well right out of the box and the sound is great. I don’t have EQ on any of my music apps and you won’t need it with these, in my opinion. Buy them!",5,1,2019-11-30,1,0,1
"My big two cons for these ear buds are first. Every 30min to an hour I get a ""Link loss"" message while listening to videos on my computer.

"I bought these wireless earbuds after doing some research. I had wanted something like the Apple AirPods but those are much too expensive so when I came across the TOZO 6 and looked at their reviews, I decided that it would be a much better option that balances out the pice and quality quite nicely. I like the sound systems and how TOZO provided different sizes for the earbuds (I had to go a size smaller so I'm thankful). The earbuds stay in your ear really well and are waterproof which is really good when you're working out or moving around a lot. Some people got a wireless charging pad for the headphones, but if you don't have it there's a small piece of rubber covering that you have to peel out for the charging cable.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,1,0
"I was initially trying to decide between AirPods, Beats, and Bose. I knew that I needed amazing sound, noise cancellation, lightweight, and something that would not fall out while running. I just hated the price point! Let’s face it, Apple has enough of my money after phone, watch, and computer.I scoured reviews, knowing what I needed and with a budget of no more than $100.00. I found that the TOZO T6 checked everything box and had the added bonus of being waterproof. Seriously consistent reviews and way below what I was budgeting for them.",5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0

"I purchased the TOZO T10’s and have been very happy with them overall. I purchased them during an Amazon deal of the day promotion. I signed up for the warranty and free giveaways and was lucky enough to be a part of a giveaway. The giveaway gave me the ability to try receive the new TOZO T6’s and I think both are great wireless earbuds. I do have to say though, the T6’s are the better of the two.I enjoy the T6’s more than the T10’s, and I really enjoy the T10’s. The ear buds are slightly smaller and lighter than the T10’s which I am completely fine with. Although this is true, they are just snug enough to make you comfortable that they will never fall out. The main plus that is better than the T10’s are the touch controls. In my search for wireless ear buds, this was something I strongly considered but decided against due to high prices for the quality sound and functionality. With the T6’s, which are much cheaper than others, they have the same quality (even good at max volume) and functionality if not better.",5,1,2019-9-25,1,0,1
"I'm pretty impressed with these so far, especially for the price with the 20 percent off coupon.  They are extremely comfortable and even extended wear doesn't hurt my ears at all.  The sound isn't the best I've ever heard, but it's pretty good and considering the price I actually think its fantastic.  Build quality is good and the case feels very solid.I liked the pair I bought enough that I ended up buying a second pair as well for use with another device.  For entry level wireless earbuds, I don't think you can do much better than this.",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"So far so good on these headphones! I’ve used them while leaf blowing and mowing the yard and they stay securely in your ear fairly well. I have not yet had them fall out. I also make sure to push them deep into my ears in order to ensure a good fit. They do come with a couple varying sizes of earbud that you can change in order to fit either a bigger or smaller ear canal than average.Regarding the connection to my phone which is an iPhone 11, once you open the case and remove the headphones they connect right away really well with no further action needed. For the price these are awesome so far!",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0

I've owned not only previous items from TOZO, but other Chinese ones as well. You get what you pay for let's be honest. While time will tell if these are worth it. I would say the automatic earbud sync is great, but the finger touch controls can be troublesome. Especially when working out and you are just fitting the bus back in your ear. I almost 100% stop or change the track just in refitting them. A bit bothersome, but livable for the moment.",4,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0
"My teenager son suggested I buy this pair as he owns the older model. He showed me how nicely the older model works and even dumped it in water to show me they are waterproof. I wanted to give him the newer model and take the older model; however, I love the new features of being able to skip to the next song. I'll buy him his own new pair since I really enjoy that feature. The sound quality is great. I am able to turn the volume up and down. The case is small which I love since I have small hands. I also have small ears so having the option to switch the size of the earbuds is great. They included an option that firs perfect in my ears.

"Very good sound quality and comfortable fit in the ear.  It is bigger than others earbuds I see, yet it is comfortable to the point that after a few minutes you forget they are in your ears.  My only complaint is with sensitivity of the touch controls.Taking them out of the case, you need to have them both out so they can ""pair"" before connecting to your device.  If you touch the pad on the first while removing, it start looking for the device and plays only the one side.  To reset you have to divorce from source and start over.",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"The headphones sound great and fit pretty good. But the finger touch is terrible, absolutely awful. Every time you go to adjust the headphone position they pause the music because you just touched the fingerprint section. Everytime you're putting them away you accidentally touch them again and by the time the music starts playing you've put the headphones away in the case so your phone starts playing the music through its speaker, so hopefully you weren't listening to anything embarrassing in public. I hate the finger touch, I wish they went with buttons instead.",3,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"Very convenient to use; carrying case cum charger is easy to use. Putting earbuds into case turns them off and starts charging; removing them from case turns them on, couples the pair and links to phone via Bluetooth.I have experienced only one small glitch. Sometimes while listening I'll hear an odd blip sound that lasts for less than a second. The sound is a bit louder than what I'm playing and the podcast continues playing. When this behavior starts I'll hear the unwanted sound maybe once every 30 seconds or minute. Rebooting my phone usually fixes the problem.

Troubleshoot, replace, upgrade. Highly recommend these and the seller!My only con is the volume is not as loud as my last pair.

There is also no way to turn them off manually, you seem to have to put them back into the charging box to shut them off.

"This is the third pair of wireless earbuds that I have purchased, and they are by far the best quality sound. They also fit better than the others. The ear piece extends further into your ear, making it a more secure fit and better noise cancelation. Also, this case is smaller than the others, in a good way. It does have less battery back up, but it's small enough to fit in your pocket vs being a huge clam shell that weighs a ton. The only issue I had was that the right earbud was not as loud as the left. The customer service team was very responsive and addressed the issue by sending a replacement. The new pair is fantastic.

The touch lags badly, and the large surface that seems like it would all be touch is only about half touch pad. The sound quality is pretty good.

My only complaint is how sensitive the touch commands are—I have to be very careful when adjusting them in my ears or removing them as to not disturb what I’m listening to or to make things skip forward, rewind, etc. Overall would recommend.",4,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"I tend to lose things so I didn't want to invest big money on ear buds. I wanted to be able to listen to music, audio books, podcasts, phone conversations in one ear and listen it for my little kids with the other. This was an excellent choice. By using one at a time I could technically listen all day without recharging. They have different functions depending on where you touch the buds and I accidently fast forward/reverse sometimes. It's not a deal breaker for me. I bought my dad a more simple/less expensive ear bud set from Tozo so I'm happy with their products and especially their tech support.

I've had these for a week now and so far so good. They paired with my Pixel phone straight out of the box with no issues whatsoever. I also will at times use just one headphone at a time in order to hear what is going on out of the other ear and still have access to Bluetooth calling. Then when I want both I just pull out the other one and they hook up seamlessly so far. People seem to be able to hear me quite well BUT... The Google Assistant seems to be quite deaf at times to the commands given through this Bluetooth device - yet no issues with as yet any other Bluetooth device. Go figure...,5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0

I can wear them in the morning, charge over lunch and go the rest of the day.While they don't have noise cancelling, they come with an assortment of sized rubber ear caps.

"These headphones are extremely good at noice cancellation; got into a little disagreement with my partner because he thought I was ignoring him. So, they work well in that aspect. I also have very small ear holes which make most headphones hard to fit and stay in my ears. These fit snuggly in my ears and don't budge. Pairing to my phone was easy and so was charging.Update: the Bluetooth connection is great. I was able to leave my phone upstairs while I went downstairs w/ my headphone, even in the garage, and they still worked!",5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,1
"Received - 12/08/2019I'll start off by saying I have the T10 and to compare the T10 to the T6, I would almost say I'd like the T10 a little more for reasons that may not bother others. I love both for there little quirks.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
I tired Apple earpods but I have very small ears and they were so uncomfortable and fell out. I ordered the T6's to try them out before returning the earpods so I could compare the sound! I have to say that other then slightly less base on the T6 the sound clarity and quality is nearly identical!!! The bonus other than the price is that the T6's come with all different sizes of  ear pieces and the smalls are a perfect fit. The battery life seems to be right around 6 hours! I am returning the Apple earpods and these are the ones that I'm keeping!,5,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
"I cannot rave enough!!! Excellent for price, have not tried d original samsung to compare, but great fit, clear sound, great base, seem to cancel out noise completely!!!I bought a second pair because I loved it so much! Used in the shower full comversation with towel hair wrap on occasional water splash no problem dropped it in a cup of water no problem. cannot beat these buds!",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"I’m so so happy with these earbuds.  I work nights as a nurse so I’m on my feet most of the time and these have great range. I can go 150 ft before losing my connection, but it connects back quickly when I’m back in range. I usually only have one in so I can hear what’s going on around me at work,  so the controls aren’t the same, and even with both in when I’m not at work I’m not used to the controls yet, but that’s me, not the device.  The quality is great and they block out external sounds really well.  I also wear them at times when I go to sleep since I’m sleeping in the daytime and it can be loud at times with the nice weather coming.  Overall so far, great product and the case wirelessly charges really well and they stay charged well with use.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,1
"These are phenomenal. I was nervous at first because I'm always pushing earbuds back into my ears and these are perfect. They send you 6 different sizes to choose from and the comfort is excellent. These pair so quickly. The sound is outstanding. Love the tap feature to pause, play, skip and adjust volume. I am very happy with these.I've used this numerous times now and I have to say, the quality is amazing.  The ability to  pause, play, skip songs and adjust the volume on the earbuds is so great.  The bluetooth range is excellent and they are very comfortable.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"So far so good! I had a pair of the white TOZO T6 earphones I lost so my husband got me another pair. I like them because they are clean, modern, and discreet. After searching for a while I ultimately chose these bc they do not have writing on the outer earbud where people can see. The sound is great for the size of these things. I often listen to songs with very deep and guttural bass. In extreme cases you can hear the bass crack but 95% of the time the sound stays clean. I like to wear one and listen to an “adult” song or podcast without the toddler listening in. I highly recommend these!",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"I use them every day. They're great except a couple of things:-No keychain or anything to hook it onto someplace convenient for carrying. However, the case fits right into the inner-pocket of my jeans (it's not the most comfortable thing).",4,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"Sound quality is really what disappointed me, it’s not nearly as loud as I’d hoped, and after using them heavily for over a month, it seems the sound quality has degraded even further, however these are really nice for the price. The battery life is very impressive. I worked full 8 hour shifts and never had to charge them until after work. The charge case is great and small enough to carry anywhere. the ear buds themselves are touch controlled and work very well. No problems with syncing them either as it always paired with my phone almost immediately, it comes with 4 different sizes of silicone buds, and I’ve never had them fall out of my ears.",3,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"I was incredibly excited to get these headphones, especially when I first heard them. The sleek black finish looks excellent and the sound quality is some of the best I've ever heard. The noise cancellation is good enough that I use them as ear plugs around noisy machinery. These are the only reasons I gave them 2 stars and not 1. They are a quality product. But the issue is that the touch sensitive buttons make any sort of chore or long wearing period a nightmare. This is a terrible design that I didn't think about before purchasing, but is incredibly clear now that I've had them for a month.I wear my headphones when I do yard work and house chores. They fit in my ears well, but once I become sweaty or if I move around a lot they get loose. Everytime you try to readjust them—Forward— Pause— Reverrrse— it's mind numbing. I can't make it through a 3 minute song without skipping or reversing, or pausing. This makes weed whacking, lawn mowing, doing the dishes (tasks where your hands aren't free) a living nightmare. At first it's not a huge deal, but the hundredth time you skip a song you like, or pause your music you'll want to scream. I tried to listen to an audio book, repeatedly lost my place. I tried wearing gloves to keep this from happening; so far they sense most work gloves. I tried nudging with my shoulder: still skips/pauses/reverses my songs.",2,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"I'm not fan of vacuum headphones or heavy user in general. So, needed something within a reasonable price with a hope of good quality sound. This earbud performed much better than my expectation. Sound quality is much better than many I've used from Samsung and it doesn't bother much even after extended period. Connection is good. The only thing that seems little weak is the range of signal. My 5yr old Bluetooth earphone has a much better range than this piece. It's starts cutting after 10-15ft with minor obstruction. It's OK but an area to make it better.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"Overall these are great earbuds and very reasonably priced.  I really like that they connect automatically and charge in the compact charging case, as well as being IPX-8.  I have smaller ears, so I didn’t know how comfortable they’d be but the smallest earbud option they provide works, and you also don't need to push them fully into your ear to the point of suction  (they don’t fall out for me when putting them in halfway).  Sound quality is great. My only issue was my charging casedid not seem to be holding a charge properly, but customer service responded within hours to send me a replacement unit.  Great customer service.",5,1,2020-3-26,1,0,0
"These headphones are great for exercising. I've tried many, many wireless headphones. Almost all come out or feel like they're coming out during strenuous exercise like jumping rope, running stairs, burpees, etc. My old brand is not available anymore, so I tried these. I was pretty hesitant at first, but they work really, really well. They never feel like they're coming out or even close to coming out. In fact, I find that the only reason I even touch them during a workout is because I'm just used to always having to adjust the old ones, so I do it out of habit. The charging station (the case) is great. It's a little awkward getting them out, but it just takes a little practice. Also, the controls are pretty sensitive, but again, it just takes some getting used to. I Alsop like how these headphones can rewind, not just fast forward.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"Headphones worked as advertised for the first few months averaging use around 3-4 hours per day 5 times a week but after a 4-5 month span issues started to come up and with the caveat of not staying in that well when exercising I would have comfortably rated them 4 stars during that initial period. As time with the product gone on that rating is represented here due to the described short comings.First issue came after about 2 months with the headphones not turning off when in the case causing for the battery to constantly drain and my phone being confused on what audio source to use and required manually disconnecting the Bluetooth connectivity on the phone to the headphones, resetting the headphones did not fix the issue.  Second thing was that the left ear bud started to have a shorter and shorter battery life than the right ear to were eventually it will not keep a charge longer than 3 minutes compared to the right ear bud lasting hours. At this point I am out a set of headphones that I now need to replace, you definitely get what you pay for here.",2,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
I love these earbuds! The sound quality is fantastic and they feel good in the ear...I have only 1 complaint...which is small...but the touch sensitivity is a little too sensitive...I love having the touch features such as volume control and track selection...but whenever I adjust them itll either pause or skip ahead...which when I listening to music isn't too bothersome but when I'm listening to audiobooks it throws me all off..also if I take one out and put it in my pocket itll skip tracks from touching my leg or whatever other than that these are well worth the money...this is my second pair from tozo and will be buying from them more often!,5,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0
"I’m one of those people who always checks and usually goes by the best selling products. I’ve had two pairs of T10 earbuds but their functions are limited and both have had connectivity issues with one of the earbuds which has become increasingly frustrating. Decided to give the brand a chance and get the T6 ones. Right out of the box I tested the features and they make the product so much better. A little on the sensitive side but if hiking, biking or running it’s so much more convenient to not have to take out my phone and use them. Highly recommend at the price point.",5,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
Pros:-Battery lasted a very long time and the mobile charger recharged the bud to full capacity multiple times on a single charge for itself.,1,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"I purchased a pair of TOZO T6 ear buds after my LG wired finally quit 3 months ago. I was skeptical because the battery life was rated lower. I have to say 6 hours of constant play with phone answering didn’t seem like a lot. I was wrong. While driving I only use one at a time anyway. Both will connect either primary or secondary. When the primary was low I switched to the secondary which became the primary. They work great for cycling and singular for an ear bud to talk hands free. The sound quality is great, base is clear.  The touch function takes a couple of wearings to get used to.  I should have switched long ago but the cost factor was in play. Now at sub $40 on Amazon it’s a no brainer.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"I'm not usually one to write a review but currently sitting 3ft away from someone who is playing a podcast from their Macbook at around 60% volume and I CAN HEAR IT CLEARLY OVER MY PODCAST BEING PLAYED THROUGH THESE EARBUDS AT FULL BLAST has finally gotten to me. I've had these earbuds for a bit over a week and the volume is extremely low. I like to listen to podcasts/music while I'm on the go and these earbuds are useless once I'm in the city. I can hear cars passing louder than the volume this gives at its max. I bought this to replace a much cheaper TWS earbuds as one of the buds got noticeably lower than the other so with 20k almost 5 stars reviews I was confident in this purchase. Now I feel scammed that a wearing old earbuds perform better than this $40 one. This is highly upsetting. I can attest that battery life is good, connectivity is commendable and the bass sounds good but if the only time I can hear audio clearly is in the still of the night or a silent library then this is a FAIL.",2,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
Bought for my wife. Only used them once so far but so far so good. She liked that it comes with 6 ear pieces for better fit and comfort. Paired very quick and easily. I purchased these based on reviews.,5,1,2020-2-25,1,2,1
"Full disclosure, I am an earbud junkie and was given these by the manufacturer in return for an honest review of the product. With that being said, let's go forward with my review.I first came in contact with TOZO when I purchased the T10 earbuds. I enjoyed them quite a bit and found that they had a much better sound quality to them than others in the same price range. The T6 is a huge improvement over the sound quality of the T10, TOZO has really stepped up to the plate in getting a better sound quality for around the same price I paid for the T10's. The base is rich and strong and you can hear everything in the mid and high ranges as well.",4,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"The audio clips of the vocal feedback (""battery low"", ""primary"", ""secondary"", etc.) are read in a really cheesy 'happy' voice, and the clips sounds like they were slowed down.The result is pretty awkward, and I would NOT have purchased this item if i had known about the vocal feedback.",3,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"I’ve been looking for an amazing set of wireless earbuds and these have met every single one of my needs! They excel at noise cancellation to the point I can only hear people talking to me if I’m paying attention to them and even then they are almost impossible to understand. The sound quality is also really good, I listen to all different types of music and I have never had a problem getting the best experience possible. The battery life isn’t super special but due to the ease of using the charging case I have never had them die unless I forgot to charge the case. Overall this is an amazing product and I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a high quality pair of wireless, easy to use, earbuds!",5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"These TOZO T6 ear phones are much better than expected. The company has put thought into the design and I can't think how it could be much better. Sound quality is very good! Lows, mids, and highs are clear with depth. The battery life is good. No these are not gonna last all day without a charge but the functionality of the charge case makes it easy to keep life at a high percentage. I'm not one to keep these headphones consistently on; however, I do pull them out multiple times during the day. Speaking of that case, a compact design with the added feature of wireless charging makes it too easy for me to ever worry about battery life. The only downfall is the touch sensitive earbuds for answering, vol up and down, skip, etc. takes some getting used to. Your not going to put these in and go for a jog and not get irritated trying to work the controls while maintaining a good pace. An added bonus is your not going to have to worry about them falling out as you beat your noggin trying to change the volume. These things come with a wide variety of inserts for your ears so figure out your size and get use to those taps on the buds to control your listening enjoyment.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"I ordered three pairs of Tozo T6 for my family members.  The two teens use the waterproof IPX8 in the shower.  Go figure.  After one such shower, my son noticed the right earbud was functioning at about 15% volume.  In case the ear bud was wet, we tried leaving it in a bag of uncooked rice for two days, and also setting the earbud in front of a fan for two days.  We are not in a humid environment.  I contacted the company regarding an obviously needed warranty replacement (yes, the request was within the time limit).  The company wanted us to do things that, as an experienced electronics engineer, I knew would not make a difference (such as putting the right ear bud into the case in the left side to charge there).The company then stated that they would ship us a new pair of earbuds *IF* we posted a ""kind (product and service) review"" and sent them a screenshot of the posted review.",3,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"EDIT Heartbroken at how these turned out. They were awesome. About a month in, they started dropping out. They still showed connected, but couldn’t hear or be heard. I reset them numerous times. Contacted amazon, quickly received a new pair. They were totally defective. Would continue to play content in the case, wouldn’t display charging progress, had difficulty pairing. I rely on ear buds a LOT, especially now that I’m working from home more. Finally but the bucket and bought the $$$ ones from the big brand. <sigh> I wish this story had a happier ending.Great product at a great price. I cannot wear the “big brand” entry level ear buds because they fall out of my ears. I didn’t want to shell out the cash for the “pro” model with tips. I was searching for a solution and was shocked to find such great quality at a low price. They are comfy, have lots of sizes of tips for perfect fit. They also come in pink! The sound is clear and has great bass response too.",2,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"Ok so these were my first wireless earbuds ever so I was pretty skeptical purchasing them at first but I decided to take the plunge because other “brand” name buds are just way too expensive. I intended to use them for my bike rides that I take pretty much daily and each one last about an hour or so. First putting them in they’re extremely comfortable (I have smallish ears) and snuggly enough to where I’m positive they won’t fall out. But the sound, god damn the sound! I’m not exactly an audiophile but I use expensive headsets for my pc and these earbuds are comparable to those which is incredible. I used them for the first time and heard bass and sfx I didn’t even know was present on some songs. Can’t rate the sound well enough honestly. Aside from that the battery life lasts just as long as they say it does. I only have to charge the case about once a week and that only takes an hour or so so that’s great too. Phone calls work fantastic as well, I tested it out while I was going about 14mph on my bike with nothing covering the earbuds so there was ample wind. Called my dad and he said he could hear me loud and clear if only a tiny bit muffled by the wind.Unfortunately my charging case died about a week ago for some unknown reason. I contacted support today and they got back to me saying they’re sending another one my way. I’ve never had a company respond to me so promptly. It is worth noting that I filled out the warranty card it came with so he sure to do that in case any issues come up. I’ll update this review once I get the charging case in the mail.",5,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"I read many reviews and compare different models before deciding for these earbuds and so far I’m very pleased.First of all I was impressed by the quality of the packaging. Second, pairing was super simple. It’s amazing how many different rubber tips are included, I tried a few and voila! Although these earbuds are not labeled as noise cancelling, when the rubber tips insert into my ears they do provide some noise canceling in my opinion.",5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
"I found this product after I returned the sorry piece of garbage echo buds. I was looking for a decent quality with great sound that wouldn’t fall out your ear. I found these and let me tel you these don’t disappoint. I love the case I love the. The sound is amazing and the controls work great. I’m very satisfied with my purchase. Also the warranty is amazing as well. Unlike the echo buds, after I paid the $130 they only worked for 2 weeks then stopped. I called amazon with a return and was told I would have to wait for the specialist team to diagnose them. After waiting another 2 weeks. I called again and asked for my money back.  Thank he amazon rep acted like he didn’t want to give me my money back. But I’m the end I got it. I will never buy another pair of echo buds or recommend them to anyone. These TOZO are by far a better product. Will buy again for a gift for friends and family.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
"I bought these earbuds to replace a cheap pair I'd gotten about a year ago that were just not holding up anymore. I’d grown used to my old earbuds that were okay for the first 30 minutes but quickly caused pain in my ears after that. So far these have been incredibly comfortable — I forget they’re even in! I usually will wear one then swap out to the other ear for continuous use but I haven’t had to swap out really so far! I’m also pumped to test out their water-proof capabilities since I keep a different schedule from my husband and like music in the shower but don’t like waking him up. All in all a great product, well worth the money!",5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,1
"I wasn’t expecting much because they were at a good price, but I must say these earbuds are awesome. They are loud and the bass is amazing. They are very convenient and the fact that they are waterproof makes them sooo much better since I do work both out and indoors.

My sister keeps scaring me because I can not hear her walking up behind me =] I love that the base in these headphones is great quality, I like a good base.

"I'm writing this because I feel like the other reviews are misleading. Many people were given a free set and I find that sways their opinion. Anyway, I bought these to use at school while I'm creating artwork or waiting for a class to start. I'm no headphone junkie by any means, but here's my opinion on these. Easy to pair, sound quality is fine. The battery lasts a good bit. But the fit/comfort just isn't there for me. I've tried all their adapters and they are either too big and hurt or too small and fall out/move around. To get a decent seal it takes way too much adjusting. And while I'm trying to adjust, I'm constantly tapping the area that is used to play/pause/volume/skip. It drives me crazy that adjusting them in my ear causes them to think I'm trying to do any of those things. Bottom line, I'm stuck with them now and will use them, but I wouldn't purchase again.",2,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"When my beloved BeatsX died after 3 years (Bluetooth earbuds that connect behind the neck with a wire), I was really disappointed. I mainly use these at work to listen to podcasts. I'm a graphic designer that works in a production facility, and I'm able to concentrate and listen to podcasts/music when I'm staring at a screen working on a project, and also when I'm moving around printing jobs and doing production work. I wanted to replace my Beatsx with another Beats pair because: (1) I loved the connectivity (I could be anywhere inside or even outside of our huge building and the sound wouldn't cut off, even behind closed doors; (2) the ease of use to charge via lightning cable (as an iPhone user, one charging cable is so easy); (3) ability to hear my work phone ring, calls over the intercom, or coworkers talking to me. The BeatsX weren't necessarily super noise cancelling, but I primarily used these with only the right earbud in at work and connected to my work iMac, and I was still able to hear around me. The only complaint I had was hearing the wire friction come up to the earbud, but it wasn't too big of a deal after a while. (4) Play/Stop and volume controls on the wire and the length of the wire connecting the earbuds, and having an actual wire so they wouldn't get lost. If I needed to take out a bud away from my desk, I wouldn't' have to figure out where to put. Also, people could see if I had an earbud in my ear; with a true wireless earbud my hair is hiding my ear. I had a cheap pair of Bluetooth earbuds that I got in a Fab Fit Fun box that I used while I researched a new set, and the cord was too short and forever getting yanked off my neck, the connectivity was terrible even just 10 feet from the iMac I was connecting to, and the materials themself were cheap and flimsy. Beats were cost prohibitive during this Covid time of reduced hours, and I came across the Tozo T6 with so many thousands of positive reviews. I could deal with another charging cable - I was miserable at work not having anything to listen to but coworkers. For the price, I could deal with no wires connecting. Reviews said sound was good - for mostly podcast listening I didn't need Bose quality sound. The morning I decided to bite the bullet they were a Lightning Deal with 11 minutes remaining, so I jumped on the deal. I love that the case charges by itself and you can get 3 or so charges out of it. I'm able to use one earbud at a time, they connect pretty easily every time, and when one goes battery low, I pop it in the case to charge and I swap it for the other one (make sure you heed the battery low warning asap if you're not listening to a Rated G podcast on a work computer - I made the mistake once and it reverted to speakers. Good thing it was an NPR podcast). I have to tell my iMac to connect to the new bud, but it's not a big deal. The case is nice and compact, and I was happy to find a compatible silicone case on here for less than $7. Connectivity is pretty awesome. The range is about the same as my Beatsx, and the only interference I get is when I'm in the kitchen in the back corner at work and using the microwave. That's pretty good in my opinion. I'm dealing with no wires, but as a woman who wears leggings to work often and has no pockets, I am stuck with holding my earbud when I take it out. I'm getting used to the touch controls. I don't really use the volume because I only use one earbud at a time, and sometimes the touch to Stop/touch to Play works, sometimes it seems it doesn't. I get a lot of stopping when I take out the earbuds because  you have to touch the top of it to remove. And I guess I accidentally double tap too much when trying to Start/Stop that I get the ""Forward"" or ""Reverse"" messages a lot. All in all, I am pretty impressed with these as my first pair of true wireless earbuds and if they're on sale again I'll buy a pair for my husband.",4,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0
"I was pleasantly surprised by these earbuds. I don't have high expectations for earbuds. I find that they are typically uncomfortable, bulky, and have dicey connections. These fit my ears comfortably, have no connection issues, and provide the high quality flat studio sound that I'm looking for. My ONLY beef with these is volume control. When I ""touch and hold"" to left or right for vol+ or vol- the slight touch pushes the earbud into my ear slightly, which is uncomfortable, and then beeps on the side I've touched, while simultaneously reducing volume in that ear to allow for the beep to be heard. This behavior feels odd, like the one side is depressurizing like when you have to ""pop"" your ears in an airplane. Because of this, I prefer to change volume only using my phone or laptop instead of using the ""touch and hold"" feature. I would totally recommend these despite this one minor gripe.",5,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"Love my new ear TOZO T6 earbuds! Got tired of my Apple earphones falling out my ear after 10 seconds EVERY TIME! The T6 have great hi end sound without the hi end price. I also like the very compact charging case they come in. Very light weight and can easily fit in my shirt pocket without me noticing it. My former wireless headphones and earbuds had trouble lots of times pairing with my iphone, LG smart TV, and Chrysler 300 uconnect radio. The TOZO T6 pairs with all these effortlessly!

I love the case on these as it is much smaller and more modern looking than the previous version. I am also really liking the touch controls as compared to the buttons on the T10s. I have not yet taken them out for a jog but given that the T10 model did well with that I figure that this T6 model will do great as well.

"A few months ago I purchased 3 pairs of the Tozo T10 ear buds. I was absolutely impressed with them. I liked them so much I sent an email to them stating that. They responded quickly and thanked me for my purchase. A few weeks later they contacted me and asked if I would like to try the Tozo T6's and then give my honest opinion on them. I sad yes and purchased them, and was promptly refunded their cost. My son saved up his hard earned money from summer chores and had recently bought a pair of the Samsung Galaxy Buds. I find that the T6's don't have as many bells whistles, but I prefer them to the Galaxy Buds. The build quality is very good. The battery life is plenty adequate for my use. Most importantly they sound great. They have a wide sound stage and nice bass. They do not sound cheap. They fit into their charging pod with a satisfying snap. I would have gladly paid for them without the reimbursement and highly recommend them.",4,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0

"I primarily wear bluetooth air pods for long runs or long bike rides.  I rarely use these to talk on the phone.  This review is based on audio listening only.  I have the Apple AirPods (1st generation) and they worked great but during the first six months the bluetooth connectivity was also troublesome and eventually the battery life was no longer 5 hours before needing to be charged.  I would wear one at a time, keeping the other ear alert to my surroundings.  This was disappointing both connectivity issues and battery life not lasting the full 5 hours as claimed.  The Tozo T6 battery life so far is holding up and the bluetooth connection is seamless.  As soon as I open the case, they connect to my phone.  The Apple air pods 1st generation were never consistent with connecting automatically.  One thing I noticed between the two is that the air pods ""charging"" area is exposed to the elements which could explain debris buildup which would interfere with fully charging the pod.  The Tozo T6 charging area is actually facing your inner ear so it's never really exposed to collect debris.  For the price they are fantastic.  I enjoy listening to music or audio books during long rides or runs.  This does the trick.  If you're looking for a decent pair of bluetooth AirPods without the hefty price, these will do just fine.  I will say the Apple AirPods (1st generation) are definitely more comfortable than Tozo T6 for me.  The Tozo has different ear covers to fit your ear.  I use the smallest.  After awhile (2+ hours) the Tozo T6 ear pods become a bit uncomfortable because they are slightly bulkier than the Apple Air Pods.",4,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"This is my second pair - I lost one in my first pair.  They're a bit heavy and being untethered .... they're apt to drop.Besides being a bit heavy for my relatively small ears, I don't like using them for running b/c the fit is so snug (hense the good noise cancelling) I can hear the pounding of my footsteps as I run.",4,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"I was very dissapointed with the sound quality.  The high’s are distorted along with the bass past 60% volume.  I may have gotten a defective pair due to the fact the lid on the case is ready to break off.  Initially the lid of the case seemed to be tight but after a week of usage, it became really loose where the lid opened itself up by its self exposing the earbuds.  I’m very disappointed and Really wish I could get another pair.UPDATE 11/20/19",5,1,2019-11-16,1,0,0
"These things are amazing! I can't believe I wore a corded headset for so long not knowing these existed. The sound quality is great, when you find the correct size bud for your ear, they are very comfortable. (and they come with multiple sizes you can change out) The only ""problem"" I've found is that if my long hair is wet (I air dry it), it will sometimes turn them off or make it skip lol. I solve this by putting it in a pony tail.I even ordered a pair for my boyfriend, he also loves them. We will be recommending to our friends and family.",5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"I bought these earbuds for my mom, but she was having issues with them so she sent them to me to see if I could figure out what was wrong with them. I immediately found that the left earbud wasn't working out of the box, but after contacting Tozo customer support we were able to try a few troubleshooting steps to determine that the left earbud was bad. They're sending me out a replacement unit so I can test them out fully before sending them back to my mom. Their customer service is very responsive and extremely willing to help out. I'm looking forward to testing out the replacement unit as what I've experienced with the right earbud seems to be good quality audio, and I'm excited to experience a full stereo soundstage. I'd currently recommend the headsets going by my limited experience, the awesome value for the price, and the great customer service.",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"Great earbuds. They have amazing sound quality. You put them in and it’s as if you were immersed in the music; almost like a concert. Noise cancellation is the best I’ve ever experienced. You hear nothing around you which is annoying if you have people constantly bothering you but amazing all the other time. I love how the controls are easy to handle. One touch and the music is paused. I can even use Siri with them. Battery life has last I don’t even know how long. I want to say 6 hours and they charge so fast. I’ve gone in the water with them. They work great, it’s a little weird in the shower though feels like I’m in a waterfall or something. Overall great product. I’d buy as a gift for a friend.",5,1,2020-10-5,1,1,0
"The Good:Sound quality is great for the form factor. Bass is not great, but that's typical with wirefree buds. Battery life is great, I basically kill about 25%-50% battery in the case after a days use. I'm fine as long as it lasts more than a day in case i forget to charge it the night before.",4,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"Wow I am impressed ! I did not want to spend to much money on air pods and plus I needed something sleek looking because I work for security. I love that I can talk on the phone hands free and it’s pretty stylish. I like that it came with multiple micro foams to fit my ears to my needs. (Small ears I have😂) I look more professional at work instead of having to pick up my phone to my ear, I definitely can work out in these. I can listen to music as well in one ear and talk on the phone. I am a music technology major in college so i really analyze sound and music equipment plus headphones over the years when I edit music, the quality I hear isn’t bad at all?? It Sounds really good. Thank you !!!Cons : is that its super sensitive. I have dreadlocks and one of my dreads hit my earbud and my music stopped . But I learned to deal with it .",5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,1
"I ordered these Saturday afternoon and they arrived Sunday afternoon. They worked right out of the box. Paired up and sounded awesome. I jumped in the shower with them in. I live in an old house. Lath and plaster. My phone was in the other end of a big old house and I never lost connection. I did shut them off a time or two while washing my hair.I have used these to listen to binaural beats while I sleep too. A tad uncomfortable but still doable. I was able to sleep, just not full on my side.",5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"I have used the neckband earbuds for years, but didn't figure another pair would last very long with a new baby (they tend to grab and pull things). I reluctantly opted for earbuds. I usually tend to look for name brand electronics in hopes that it may mean it's better quality but I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg and these had much better reviews than many of the big names.I finally received them and have to say, I'm pretty impressed! & now I have 3 kids wanting a pair...",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"If you're in the market for awesome earbuds, buy these right now. Your search is over. Go spend the time you've saved researching with family and friends.The sound quality is top-notch, very comparable to my Sony WH-1000XM3 over-ear headset. Just make sure you test out the different tip sizes to get a proper seal inside the ear. I can't stress this point enough.",5,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
"These are by far the worst earbuds I ever used. First off the touch control are so sensitive that even if you adjust them in your ear by only touching Hong the sides, the ear buds will call a random number on your phone. If you don’t touch these in the precise way it will have an unpredictable outcome. Now the sound/ noise canceling; with the volume up to full blast I can still hear traffic and also sounds like the opening of the Velcro pockets on my shorts. I would hate to exercise with these on, god knows who they will call in my  contacts. If you don’t like to suffer I’d stay away from these.",1,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0

"I have had notoriously bad luck with earbuds in the past and I believe every case was an instance of the connection to/from the wires becoming faulty. No matter how careful I was with them, it was inevitable. Finally fed up with them, I decided to finally make the plunge to wireless bluetooth earbuds.I didn't want to go all-out and purchase some of the $200+ pairs, so I started looking around for something a bit less expensive, but not so much that it seemed to sacrifice build quality. I also wanted something with a microphone so I could easily swap to/from a phone call if using the earbuds on my phone, as well as some controls on the earbud to handle volume, next track, etc. I ended up selecting these TOZO T6 buds.",5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
Nicely packaged. Easy to hook up.Good sound quality.,5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
What I was looking for is a cordless option without sacrificing sound quality. These live up to my needs.I like the fact the T6 comes with several pairs of ear pieces. This allowed me to find a size that was comfortable but yet wouldn’t fall out.,4,1,2019-12-12,1,1,0
"This is my first foray into earbuds, so I don't have anything to compare this purchase to. They work as expected. They are easy to turn on/off, but I am having some difficulty mastering the skip track and volume commands while in use. My work-around is to use the volume and skip buttons on my phone. I have not used them for calls, but didn't intend to anyway. I like that they came with several fittings, so you can get the fit just right. I use them for running and have not had any issue with them slipping or falling out. Overall, I am happy with the sound quality. I wish they had feature to allow more ambient noise through since I run on public streets and sidewalks. I got the rosegold and love that an option other than black or white was available. All in all I am very happy with this purchase.UPDATE: The right ear pod stopped working during a run after fading in and out for about 20 minutes. However, the right pod can still be used for commands like pause. The left still works fine. I have done the factory reset from the manual and the reset from video on the Amazon customer support site. The right pod STILL doesn't work. I hope the seller will contact me with some assistance.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"I absolutely love these earbudss. I never really invested money into a decent pair of headphones, and would just get whatever I saw at ""Wallyworld"" or Ross. Man, was I missing out. I've had these buds longer than any other headphones I burned through.These earbuds sync together instead of having to sync a left earbud, then a right earbud. If you only use one earbud, the second will remain off until you put it in. The sync to my phone is very fast, and both earbuds have microphones in them for phone calls.",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"I was looking forward to receiving these.  The positives are that they are packed well, and they synced up to my bluetooth easily.The design for these are terrible, and horribly uncomfortable to wear.  I have I'd say average size ears, and they'd easily pop out of my ears.  I did like that it came with several sized caps that you can put on them, and even despite trying them all, nothing made them fit right.  I'd run, or I'd do pushups while wearing them, and they'd randomly pop out of my ears!  The touch feature hardly works too.  I'd be wearing them and the songs would skip or pause randomly while wearing them, or I'd keep hearing it say ""max volume"" every three seconds, even though I was not touching them with my fingers.",1,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"I don't typically leave long rambling kissing reviews, but these are the best earbud headphones I have ever owned. That's a steep statement but they deserve it in my opinion. Typically, these types of in-ear headphones start to annoy my ears and cause discomfort, these have not done so yet after two hours+ of in-ear use. I believe they sound fantastic when they are lodged deep enough in the ear. I like bass, and the bass response works well perfectly fine for me. I feel they are an all-around great headphone. I will absolutely buy these again if I ever need to, or know someone that is after a gift. Blew my mind how much I like these.",5,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
"Overall, these Tozo T6 wireless buds seem to be very good quality.  Several things I don't like compared to other wireless buds that I have owned in the past.1. VOLUME - not what I would consider to be strong volume - forget about pumping up the volume with these ...",3,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0

"I am completely in love with these beauties! The sound quality and easy function of the touch controls are the best part, not to mention the fact that you can just stick the case on top of a charging pod and not worry about the mess of cords (it DOES include a charging cord if it’s more convenient for you). These wireless earbuds are awesome... there’s no point in spending hundreds of dollars on AirPods or whatever the other leading names sell. These are perfect. They are extremely comfortable as well, and come with many different sizes to fit any ear! There is an 18 month warranty sticker with TOZO in the box as well. I’m very pleased with this purchase and can’t wait to use these every day!",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,1
"I struggled finding ear buds that fit and didn’t hurt my ears. Apple AirPods cause a lot of pain and don’t fit well. The various sized ear buds accessories included with this purchase made “fitting” very easy. The battery life is amazing because it charged when you return the pods to the case. I use at least one bud while shopping, walking, etc and I just love the ease of use. The fingertip commands are easy to remember and make navigation of my music and podcasts super easy. Highly recommend these pods!",5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
So far... very impressed with these wireless headphones. Don't let the relative low price fool you.  This is a very nice product at a great value.  The battery life has been excellent.  The sound quality is very good... better than I expected for wireless.  I am also impressed with the quality of materials.  The charging case is magnetic - that is the earpods snap into place magnetically and the lid to the case clasps magnetically.  Charging is fast... both with a cable or with a wireless charger.  The touch controls are very easy to use.  The product also came with several pairs of earbud tips of different sizes.I recommend this product.,5,1,2019-11-21,1,0,0
"I received my 1st pair on Friday and they came without a charging cord. I also noticed that the volume is extremely low. At the highest I would put them at a 5 on scale of 1-10 for volume level compared to other head phones I have. The second pair arrived today. This pair had the charging cord, unfortunately the volume on this pair was extremely low as well. I have a pair of $20 wireless earphones that IF you were to accidentally turn them all they way up it would be to loud. As far as sound quality goes I'd say there no better than my $20 pair.As far as fit goes, I like the Tozo's. Maybe with some time they will improve but for now I'm done with them. Sent the second pair back as well.",2,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"The earbuds work well.  I wear them during my exercise class and during some guided meditations, as well as when listening to music.  The charge case recharges the earbuds quickly and the case itself also recharges quickly.  My only complaint is the quality of the charging cable.  I immediately needed electrical tape to cover the wires at the end that plugs into the charger.  That end was never a great fit for the charge case and eventually the plug bent, becoming unusable.  Luckily I had a better quality charging cable that works well.",4,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
"I really like these earbuds. I don't regret purchasing them at all. They pair very easily to my devices and come with a variety of different sized ear cushions to help you get a snug comfortable fit. I like how you can just tap the side of the earbuds and it will stop the sounds you are blasting in your ears. The case is small and portable, very lightweight, and sturdy. They have a magnetic pull on the ear buds so they stay in place. They are easy to move around in. I also like that they come qith a warranty, because I lost one of the earbuds and contacted the company. They were prompt and very helpful sending me a replacement. I really like these affordable earbuds.",5,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0

Will come back to give an updateUpdate (7/22/20), When I get a phone call, I would have to manually ""disconnect"", not ""forget the device"", the headphone then reconnect. I don't like that I have to do that because when I am driving, I would have to pull over or end the call and call back for the headset to connect. I even tried to reset the headphones. As far as music, the quality is good. The headphones would be GREAT if I didn't have to disconnect and reconnect the headphones every time I received a phone call.",5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"My first pair of this type of truely wireless earbuds. I loved how seamlessly they connected to my phone whether I was using one earbud or two. I have no complaints regarding sound quality. All my music sounded pretty decent even on the quieter parts. The battery lasted a few hours of straight usage per fully charged earbuds. The case itself charges it up quite a few times as well. My only complaints are: 1. I wish the minimum volume could go lower slightly lower. I feel the minimum is equivalent to about 40% volume on my corded earbuds. 2. The fit isn't incredibly comfortable. I have to pick between one size of rubber ear piece that is slightly too big and uncomfortable over long periods of time, and one that's slightly too small and falls out of ear with excessive movement. 3. Not a huge deal to me but it isn't the most low-profile design. If the tradeoff for a more low-profile design is sound quality I'd much rather have the latter. Overall I'm pretty happy with the earbuds and I do use them over my regular earbuds when I can, but I definitely dont pick these over my nicer (albeit more expensive) overear headsets.",5,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"**6 Month Update** These earbuds still work, and have been a great convenience. However, connectivity has been an issue in the past month. My phone will sometimes divert audio to them even when they are docked in their closed case. This has led to a lot of frustration when answering calls and not hearing anyone. I'm not sure if this is an issue with the charging case or the earbuds themselves. Also, the company promises a ""free gift"" when you leave a review, but despite following their directions, I have not received any response or gift in six months.My first time using wireless earbuds, and I'm happy that they are so intuitive to use. Only issue I've had so far is accidentally turning them on or off when inserting/removing them, but I think this will get better with practice. Not important, but they are beautiful and I LOVE the slightly pearlized finish on the case (white color).",3,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

"Why are you wasting your money on the earphones that are so much more expensive? Like 3x more expensive!I bought the previous version, the T10.

The headphones come with a variety of rubber bud sizes and the second to largest are a perfect for me. So far the battery has been strong and unlike some of the negative reviews, I find the touch functionality is actually pretty user-friendly. The battery life hasn't been great when I've use the headphones for calls, but for listening to music/media they've been really great (6 hours is generous, but I'd say they've consistently lasted ~5 hours on a full charge). For the discounted current price ($36 with 10% coupon) these are an excellent value purchase.",4,1,2020-7-26,1,1,0
"Very good sound. Easily pairs to my iPhone, iPad and Windows PC. Nice assortment of sized earpieces. Battery life is very good - usually about 6 hours of continuous use.

Since they are waterproof, I use them in the shower to listen to news in the morning without bothering my spouse (turning up the volume on the radio so that I can hear it in the shower makes him get up all grumpy... he hates listening to the newscasts).",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"The TOZO T6 total wireless bluetooth earbuds are without exception the best I have experienced.  But this was not my initial perception.  In fact, after trying the earbuds after receipt I was disappointed in the weak sound coming into my ears using the default tips.  I even initiated a return to Amazon.  However, after experimenting with the extra tips, I found that I must have rather large diameter ear canals because I could get a tight fit with the large silicon tips.  I also found that TOZO had a update to the the firmware for the T6 which I downloaded to my Moto G7 phone and installed.  Now, these puppies are amazing.  They connect to my phone, tablet, and computer (Windows 10) seamlessly and consistently.  The controls for volume up/down, play/pause, forward/reverse, and Google Assistant (and Siri) work flawlessly.  And, to top it off, you can charge these with a wireless charging pad.  Battery life is as stated so far.  I own both the Sony WH-1000XM3 noise-cancellation headphones and the Sony WF-1000XM3 noise-cancellation earbuds, and I would say that the TOZO T6 sound as good as the Sony WF-1000XM3 earbuds, if not better.  While the T6 earbuds are not active noise-cancelling, with a proper seal the passive noise-cancelling is very good.  I learned an important lesson about earbuds--you must experiment to find the proper size tips that create a comfortable seal to block external noise and hold the earbuds securely in your ear canal.  You won't find a better, easy-to-use wireless in-ear stereo system.",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
Every facet of this product is FANTASTIC!  The packaging is professional and secures the product well.  The instructions are well written and accurate.Every feature is just as described on the web site.  The earbuds automatically turned on and paired with each other.  Pairing with my iphone 11 pro max took seconds.  The touch sensitive buttons work amazingly well and the navigation is intuitive.  The sound quality is is amazing for a $50 device.  The ear buds are plenty loud and I could listen to music comfortably with volume set to 60%.  This leaves plenty of extra volume when encountering extremely noisy environments.  I listened to several songs from numerous genres and was delighted with the sound.  The bass is full and rich while the vocals are perfectly clear.  I spent the remainder of the day listening to my old playlist and hearing songs like I've not heard them before.  The fit in the ear canal is comfortable as is but the product includes 5 other sizes of adapters for those that need to make a change.  The devices don't feel heavy and remained secure regardless of my activity.,5,1,2020-3-15,1,0,0
"I started a new job and was in the market for a set of cheaper wireless earbuds to help with sound cancellation and listening to music and podcasts while I work.

"I am very pleased with our decision to get the T6 earbuds from Tozo.  You don't have a white post hanging down, they sync easily, the batteries last much longer than I expected and they work well for calls, video conferencing and listening to music. The storage compartment charges them about 3 cycles (my experience) before it needs to be plugged in.  You do need to provide your own charging source for the included USB cable.  Big fingers do offer a small challenge removing them from the storage compartment, but even that's no big problem.  I'd recommend these to friends and family!",5,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"These earbuds are good noise cancelers, loud, comfortable, and the battery life is good. The buds charges once you place them back into the case, and comes in different sizes to fit to your comfort. They are touch sensitive, but you will get used to them once you know how to use them, when it comes to changing the volume, and answering the phone. I have to say they are water resistant, as one of my earbuds fell into a bowl of water while I was washing dishes. I let it sit to dry, it and was working just fine. I have not had a problem with these Tozo T6 wireless earbuds at all so far. For the price, there are an A+ for me, and saved me from spending over $200 for a name brand pair. I would definitely get another pair. My money was well spend.",5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"First off I wear ear buds for 10 hours a day at work. Tozo states their batteries on the T6 will last up to 5 hours. after one week of use I have gotten 5 hours (then at lunch I recharge them for the next five hours of my day). I work in a loud factory and the noise cancellation works well enough that I don't have to play my music/podcasts so loud that I can't hear anyone coming up to talk to me. They are comfortable enough to wear all day. The sound quality is very good, not first class but still very good. I have used ear buds that cost twice as much and still didn't sound any better.I have already recommended them to 2 of my coworkers.",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"I absolutely LOVE these earbuds!!! They weren't extremely pricey in comparison so I took the chance & glad I did!The sound quality is excellent. Noise cancels very well. It comes with several different tips so it fits very comfortably in my ears. I can walk, run, vacuum, do dishes, even chew food without any disruption or them feeling loose in my ears. You charge the case they are in & as you use the earbuds and put them back in the case it keeps them at full power between uses while slowly draining the case of battery. The battery lasts quite a while, no complaints!! I absolutely LOVE that I can listen with only 1 earbud, while leaving the other in the case so I'm still available in my immediate surroundings while I listen with one ear. And the 2 earbuds connect automatically even if i don't pull them out at the same time. Also, it will charge both earbuds obviously, but also only the earbud that needs it. So I can use 1 till it's dead and replace it with the other one and get twice the listening time. And the earbuds themselves are interchangeable, both in the dock and wearing them in your ears. A great purchase all around!!",5,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0

If I only listened in an easy chair I would give them 5 stars, keep them and never look back.EDIT:  The company has done very well in the customer service department.  They reached out to me and replaced the original earbuds, without delay or any hassle at all.  And the buds were a bit better than the first pair but they just aren't for me.  I can easily see how someone else could have a completely satisfactory experience.",3,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0

They really out done themselves in making these. I found a case on Amazon to protect them from falls. Sound quality is crystal clear, and the mic works wonderfully. I'm going deaf and cant afford hearing aids and these have been a life saver for me.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"These won’t even fit and stay in my ears. I don’t have unusual ears, but ended up getting real Air Pods for myself and they are amazing. Obviously a lot more expensive than these, but ergonomically there is something wrong with this design.  My preschooler plays with them now because the case is fun. I’d look at other products.",1,1,2020-7-17,1,1,0
"Overall these ear buds are great. They come with multiple sizes too fit your ears, the sound quality is pretty good and the battery life is excellent. The only downside are as follows: sometimes the audio will cut out or ""skip"". It usually happens if you skip to another song. Another issue is that the touch controls can be finicky. If you don't tap with the right amount of Force or at the right interval they won't perform the task you want. However, with those limiting issues, I won't totally recommend these buds, especially for the price. They're worth it.",4,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
"These headphones are OUTSTANDING. I usually would buy beats but I looked at the new wireless pro reviews and saw that it hurt a lot of people's ears (especially people w/ small ears). My old wireless beats would glitch and not work sometimes due to sweat getting in it. The apple airpods also hurt my ears and the apple airpods pros are dumb expensive. I bought The TOZO T6 wireless earbuds and I am very surprised with the quality of sound & tech. They are honestly just as good as my old beats (I'm talking about the bass). I feel that they cancel out sound pretty good. When I have my earpods in and playing music (at a lower volume), I can't hear people talking. If you are scared about running and not being able to hear your surroundings then you can always run w/ one pod in. It still syncs properly. 10/10 recommend for anyone looking for better wireless headphones.",5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"I am very pleased with the sound quality of the Tozo T6 wireless earbuds.  I was not expecting such good sound quality at this price point.  I followed the simple instructions for pairing and they paired with my phone flawlessly.  This is my first pair of earbuds, so I was also wondering how well these would fit.  I tried them with the default buds that came on them and they fit fine.  They feel comfortable and secure.  In addition to the buds that came on them, there are 5 sets of different sizes and styles of buds.  I'm really glad that I bought these.  Time will tell how long they will last.  If I have any problems, I'll post an update.",5,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0
"So i wanted to try some earbuds, normallly they really hurt my ears, but I wanted to give these a try.  So I ordred them, stock on the smallest eart tube thing, and bam, these are nice!  So I have vision issues, and dont drive, and when you have  a wife who talks, and two children who talk, on long car rides, these things are great.  Most of the time no one even knows they are in.  Just keep nodding and smiling.  As for the sound.  Pretty deep base, and puts you right there in the action if you are watching a movie, or like me listening to a book.  Great value for the money.  Very happy with them.",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"Paired right away out of the box. Touch controls are mostly intuitive, and the instruction manual quickly clears up the other functions.The eartip options are excellent, and include a couple shorter tips so the earbuds don't stick out as far.",5,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
"These are quite good for the price. I went this route instead of the Apple AirPods because they were cheaper (and after buying both my kids AirPods y’all know moms always get the shaft haha). They have excellent battery life and they charge super fast! They just aren’t super loud to me. They are also very touch sensitive. WHen I’m putting them on I’ll tap the pause and play about 10 times 🤦🏻‍♀️, and got help if you have to adjust them in your ear for any reason. They are very comfortable as well. I wanted some I could lay down with and not hurt my ear and these work well.",4,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"I’m retired and spend a lot of time doing things around my house. I’m also on-line a lot, so I really enjoy listening to music. And I don’t suffer bad music. I love good music through excellent headphones or earbuds. I decided on the T6 earbuds after reading almost 100 reviews. Almost all were five stars and said the T6’s excelled at all the best parts of music, both live and recorded. After hours now of listening to them, everyone was right. Two big thumbs up. You’d be hard pressed to find better earbuds at this price. I’m extremely pleased.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"I really like these so far I just got them however as soon as I got them I could feel the quality they had a good weight the charging case snapped shut well and the earbuds held within well. I really liked the variety of sizes for the buds and I was actually able to find a size and shape that for my ear shown in the pic. The touch sensitivity is good although it could be slightly quicker it’s definitely satisfactory for the price. The sound is also pretty good along with the noise cancellation, i could not hear anything when I had audio playing at full volume although I will if you like to play music at full volume so that it’s practically screaming at you these don’t deliver that but the audio is good quality and has a suitable max volume. At least it’s safer for my ears. Overall seemingly good product for the price it even comes with a warranty. The quality feels good I’m pretty satisfied with the purchase as I’ve had quite a few poor quality Bluetooth earphones and been sorely disappointed from the start. The case also charged relatively fast.Edit: so I noticed that one earbud is lower then the other and there is a slight static effect when audio is played which might be why the sound didn't seem super loud I've contacted tozo support",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,1
"Not long ago I bought T10 earbuds. Love them use them all the time while working outdoors.  Now I have received these beautiful T6 earbuds. I love the shine and quality on the build.  Wish they had more base but then again they are not $150. They are great for what I need.  Easy to use, connecting is fast, bettery is great. Love the new slim case.  I had to learn the touch sensitive buttons.  My only three issues are which are not major.  My fingers are not tiny, I cant get a grip to get them out of case.  They are slippery nicely polished.  And other is, I removed them from my ears to talk to a friend in a darkish area, cant see which is left and right.  Too small to read it. And lastly making phone calls. Indoors they work amazing other person hears me great. Outdoors it picks up too much noise from outside and people cant really hear me.My opinion they are so worth of buying. You are getting great product for a great price.  I would definitely recommend these over other expensive earbuds.  Thank you Tozo",5,1,2019-9-23,1,0,1
"I did just receive these today, so I can't write about longevity or battery life or anything like that. But overall I'm really happy with Tozo products. My mum has a pair of the T10's and that's what convinced me to give these a try, after having a bumpy experience with a different brands earbuds. As I test these out I'll edit this to have more details, but so far I would definitely recommend this product.Edit: I do think it was a problem with the way my ears are shaped, but I had a bit of an issue with the left bud not seeming to be at the same volume as the right. I would still highly recommend trying these, they may not fit your ears but it's worth a try. Everything else was really nice about these, the bass wasn't the most powerful but it was adequate for the price. I think I've personally discovered that true wireless buds just won't work for me, unfortunately.",5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"Actually I love these things a lot more than I thought I would.  They fit in my ears nicely and the sound is great.  Although the noise cancelling is decent I noticed that while flying, I was still able to hear a lot of the normal airplane sounds.  This wasn't an issue with me but I know there are some people out there that are very picky and it may be a problem.  In my opinion, these are some of the best earphones for the price point.  Oh, one more thing, the touch buttons are very sensitive and if you're not careful you will accidentally hit the button when adjusting them in your ear.  Again, not a big problem for me now that I've had them a while.  You just get used to them.",5,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"Wow.  These are fantastic. Where to start?First of all, I bought these as a replacement for Skull Candy Sesh headphones. The Sesh hurt my ear cartilage, and kept creating a vacuum in my ear canals every time I pushed a button. It was very annoying.  Not only that, but the right ear bud would constantly go silent. The quality was terrible for $50.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
These are seriously great quality headphones!Comparing these to the wired apple headphones they are literally about the same listening quality these just don’t get as loud as the wired ones but trust me the T6 get loud enough without busting your ear drums.,4,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"At first, I experienced difficulties with properly implementing the earbuds in my ear until I learned to change the type of covering on the tips. After this conundrum, the earbuds have worked exceptionally well to cover a long distance from my device, cancel outside noise, and provide an in-depth sound quality unlike any other. I no longer need to contend with tangling earbud wires and I am free to transverse as much as I like. All audio sounds fresh and immersive while the material is very comfortable to the ear.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,1
"I got these earbuds so I could go to sleep while listening to relaxing music, as well as going on jogs while blasting music. And while the volume is fine (for the most part), I can NEVER reliably move to the next/previous song with the capacitive touch controls on the earbuds themselves. It's incredibly imprecise.Sometimes, I'll tap twice and it'll act as though I had tapped once, or maybe I'll tap once and it'll ignore it. I have no idea where exactly it's looking for touch inputs, and when I'm running or sleeping or whatever, I don't have the time to just haphazardly slap the side of my head twice in the EXACT right position. Oh, and sometimes when sleeping, my ear will flex over the earbud and pause/skip the song...",3,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"We just got these in, and once I charged them fully, I had to give them a try(even if they are for my wife! But, you know, I have to be her tech support so I had the excuse of wanting to see how they worked, in case she had any questions!) First, they paired up with my iphone with no problems, whatsoever.  They paired up just like they said it would in the instructions...yes, I read them...lol.  I have to say that I'm impressed with the sound on these things!  I haven't had time to try out battery life, but I have to say I'm impressed with these out of the box!",5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"Post edit* when ear buds are in their case, they do not both charge with an inductive charger. Only the case charges. The buds turn off. They only charge with the case on USB power, or in their case without inductive charging. They also take quite a bit longer to charge in the case without USB power. It appears you get 2 full charges from the case's battery. They are also a slippery pain to get out of the case for bigger fingers.  But I do still like them. Thinking of getting a 2nd pair because the battery life and recharge time is inconvenient for all day use.Straight out the box I love em. Very cool for what I paid. They don't play quite as low (they do play very low for this tiny of a speaker) as they could but they sound really nice. And they are light. They fit and stay in. Well see how I like the touch pads. But it feels very black ops wearing them and touching the pads. Very cool. Gonna get me an MIB Suit and the quantum internet vision shades next! Ohh yeah, and a noisy cricket and a flashy thing. 😂 Enjoy your earbuds!🖖",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
Comparing tozo T6 to the the I galaxy buds plus I got my wife these are dang close to being as good. The Samsung has the wings that make them a little more secure in the ear and there are a few nice other features but bells a whistles aside the Tozo have fantastic call quality and sound quality. They are comfortable and stay in the ear. For the price I doubt you will find a better product.,5,1,2020-6-21,1,1,0
"I bought two of these T6 ear buds and let me tell you, this are amazing 👏  for the price . the sound quality is great and they fit comfortably  i use them for around 6 hours a day and I even forget I'm wearing them sometimes... the touch controls work flawlessly...also the battery life  is exelent and the battery case is nice and small with enough juice to power the buds your hole day...i recommend them 👌Update.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,1
"These are the first pair of ear budds I have owened or used and didn't know what to expect and was plesantly surprised.  The budds were easy to set up with or pair with my galaxy phone, and being new to the ear budd""Thing"" it did not take to long to fit to my ears and learn how to properly secure them in my ears.  Originally I was only using them while cutting the lawn ""mowers real loud, bad muffler"" after 3 months I started wearing them whenever I was working outside in the yard, that helpped the work go much faster and I would get more accomplished.  These Budds are easy to use have a lot of controls that im just starting to use and the sound is excellent.  I love these things .  Recently I found that my left budd was not as loud as the right budd ""could hardly hear a thing from that budd"".  I thought ""dam"" Im going to have to argue with customer service, get the run-a-round and have to mail the budds back for them to be evaluated and mabey if im lucky have a working pair sent back to me a month later after paying shipping.  Well let me tell you I could not have been more wrong.  I sent an E-mail to their customer service stating my prolbem (Here comes the begining of what I thought would be a nightmare)  The following day I had responce from Tozo saying that they were sorry that I was having a prolbem with their product, that they value their customers and again apologized for any inconvience and asked me to send them my address so that they could immediately send me a replacement at no charge.  I can only say that Tozo is a top quality, reputable compony that stands 100% behind their product(s) and has a customer service dept. that gets back to their customers with in hours.  I give Tozo 2 thumbs up.",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"I bought this headphone back in February and less than 8 months later I've had nothing but issues. The sound quality is good. Call quality is less than average because it picks up all background noise. My problem is that these headphone batteries continues to go down even when not in use! You cannot if the headphones are loose inside the case and it kills me because I'm constantly seeing my batteries are dead even when I don't use them. I advise people get something else. No problems in the beginning but now only after 8 months, its a headache.",2,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
I think my expectations may have been too high. I had the noise canceling EarPods but pass them on to my child. I bought these hoping they would suffice but the sound is really tinny and noise canceling is actually something I didn’t think it was offered. As it is nonexistent. It wasn’t until I was prompted to review the noise canceling and then I realized it was supposed to be there. I don’t mind it from my books or videos but for music I’ll go back to my wired earphones that came with my iPhone,4,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"Earbuds have very good quality sound. I appreciate the various size earbud caps, so the fit is best for noise cancelling.  The only small drawback is learning the taps for play/pause, volume, etc.; however, it is only a matter of time to learn and get used to it. The case is a nice compact size and holds the charge for a very long time.  Very easy to pair, as other reviewers have commented; just have your phone ready when you remove the earbuds. For phone calls, both must be in the ears in order for the other party to hear properly. Overall, definitely a great purchase for the price!",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"These earbuds sound great. But, there is a couple things I'm really aggravated with. Maybe it's my own ears but I cannot get them to sit in my ears well. They stick out/pop out. I've tried the different sizes and I still can't get a decent fit. The last few times they will not connect to my phone. I bought these to use at work and at bedtime and having to take the time to continouslu restart everything just to get a connection isnt something I can do while working. My friend bought a pair off amazon of a different brand. She paid less than me and has zero problems. I'm just seriously bummed about this. Otherwise they sound great. The battery life is good, too. Just wish they were designed better.",2,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"Best at price point, bar none.  I have tried several of the budget true wireless sets on Amazon.  This set bridges the gap between budget and premium better than any other set of buds I’ve found.  Sound quality, fit and finish are all excellent.  Calls sound great, no problems being heard on the other end.  Very comfortable once you find the correct fit.  Waterproofing is legit; showered in them this morning, it was awesome.  They look nice, but not pretentious.  I got the black ones.  Battery life is badass, 5-6 hours depending on volume.  Longer with only one bud in.  Box holds several charges.  Micro usb or wireless pad compatible to charge the thing.  Got them to back up my lasuneys, the lasuneys have been supplanted and are now my number 2s.",5,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
I was actually pleased with this product until the earphones stopped charging fully after 4 months of use.  The red indicator light on the earbuds  never turned blue (indicator of a full charge) so i'm only able to use them for an hour at a time till they need to be recharged again.  I kept getting disconnected and its pretty frustrating.,1,1,2020-5-11,1,2,0
"So I needed some new wireless buds, Most apple products hurt my ears after about 45 min. I figured for this price I could try them. Easy to charge. Loved the indicator on the front of the case to indicate the amount of charge. I thought it was weird that I had to turn them on individually but no big deal. I popped them in and was shocked how quick and easy to pair with my iphone. I was more shocked at the sound quality and the biggest surprise was the comfort. They fit well! They cut down on the noise tremendously but I wouldn't say noise cancelling. Overall, I am super pleased and can't wait to work out with these bad boys!",5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"These are incredible! Well worth the price - shocked. I didn’t expect them to be this good. Packaging was very nice. Sound quality is amazing, with great bass tones. Controls are very simple. Charger is really cool - plug it in to charge the headphones AND the charger, so you can carry it around and charge on the fly. Not sure how long they last yet. Only downfall right now is how your voice sounds to the other person you’re talking too. She said it sounded like I was in a tin can. But I don’t really care.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"Update: Originally gave 3 stars, but after waiting so long for a response from customer service I’m reducing my rating since I’ve bought a replacement elsewhere now.  A Tozo rep reached out to me via email after reading my original review. They offered to either replace my earbuds with one without defects or gift a $40 Amazon gift card. It’s been about a month since I’ve replied to their email & have heard nothing back since.The sound quality could honestly be better. Max volume is low compared to other brands. The tap controls are annoying as far as accidental pauses/fast forward/rewind. I’ve tried the  different sized ear cushions included & they still tend to slip out my ears. And as originally mentioned, one continues to die much sooner than the other on a full charge. Honestly, wouldn’t recommend buying this product.",1,1,2020-5-14,1,1,0
UPDATED REVIEW:I contacted the seller about my faulty air buds and they replaced my old ones...I hope that with these new ones I won't have the same issues as the last ones. Packing was in good ccondition.,4,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
Update:: a few months later they won’t connect to my phone. Wouldn’t recommend.I was unsure about these at first because they don’t fit flush in my ears like they do in the model advertisements. The buttons take some getting used to as well but I will say they auto connect immediately and they stay in while working out and running! Definitely worth the price and I’m glad I saved money trying these instead of going right for Apple AirPods. Plus they’re water resistant which is perfect for working out!! So far battery life is awesome too. Would definitely recommend.,1,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"I currently have experience using traditional Apple earbuds and the Bose Quiet Comfort II and these are a great bang for your buck. Despite Covid 19, I received them within a few days and they charge very fast from 0%-100%. Once you figure out with bud style works for your ear, they don't move about.I personally won't be going for a run with these and I'm not so sure they would stay if I did (unless you're okay with cramming them in your ear).",5,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"So I wasn't expecting much since I've had bought an older wireless headphones from the same company, that is because my previous only lasted about an hour and a half of listening at a time. Well the T6 goes beyond my expectations. They fit perfectly in my ears as they have different size plugs. They last so long on that I can just work all day with them on, I really love this. The headphones and the case are very well made, they feel good and not cheap. This has got to be the best waterproof headphones for the price hands down. I really recommend anyone that is looking to buy wireless headphones to save their money and instead of the airpods get this.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0

Makes so easy to use. Size of them is not too large. Nice little charging case they come in. The side buttons seem so work well. You do need to push them right in to get the full bass effects otherwise they can sound a bit tinny if not inserted corrected. The white color is more of a white pearl effect and my wife loves them!

"I absolutely love these. I have worn SO many types of headphones/ear buds for work and commuting and these are my absolutely favorite buds. I dont need them to be noise canceling but wow, they are. To the point where I only wear one at work so as to be able to hear whats going on around me. And I wear them almost my entire work day (8 hrs) and I can not charge them for 2 or 3 days, but generally I dont wait that long since I do genuinely love these and don't want to risk them dying on me.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0

The official pictures make the Rose Gold color look more purple-pink, but in real life it's rosy and perfectly matches my Cactus album (STAN A.C.E)! The sound is high quality and I can headbang all I want without them falling out of my ears. The mic is comparable to a phone's mic and sometimes it doesn't really detect double taps (you cant tap too slow or too fast).Overall recommend! Stream Savage with them!",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,1

I swear on everything these had a better sound lol.  It’s really mind blowing why 40$ earbuds can have more base and sound better than 200$.  So far I’m happy with my purchase on,y complaint I have is the battery life.  I hope one day they can make good sounding earbuds that last 10 hours continuous use.  They have cheap sounding ones that last 10 hours like the grde 20$ one ear piece.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0

"I've never been able to justify spending upwards of $100, or more, on a set of brand name ear buds.  I just don't use them often enough to make it justify the cost.  So, I did some research and found the previous model of these with great reviews and decided to  try this model.Honestly, they're great!  Or at least they are for my use.  I typically use them for watching a streaming show or YouTube during my lunch break or while I'm winding down for the evening.  The case is sleek and slides into my pocket without issue.

I’ve worn them in the shower, in the pool and in the rain. Absolutely love these! If you have any doubts, don’t! You can not beat these for the price.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"Excellent value for money. For fit, the earbuds come with several rubber options for a custom fit.

In July I was experiencing one of the earbuds not holding a charge.  I found a document that mentioned some steps in assisting with this problem. (1) clean contacts on earbuds and case with a q-tip.  (2) Fully charge case without earbuds in them.  (3) Completely remove earbuds from phone.  (4) Reset earbuds.  At the time this process worked and then 2 weeks later it returned.  I reached out to TOZO customer support and received a reply within 12 hrs on re sending me an new pair (10 stars).",5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"I’m giving this five stars across-the-board mostly due to what I feel is an excellent value on top of a really good quality product from what I’ve seen so far. I have had these for a couple of weeks now and wear them for at least a few hours each day, and at least one hour of that time is while running on roads and trails. I will just say that if I lived in a very populated area with a lot of vehicle traffic I would probably not wear these because they are very easy to sink into, so to speak, and tune out the world around you.My main concern was that, like some of the other less expensive wireless earbuds I have purchased recently from Amazon, these might work well initially and then break pretty quickly due to poor build quality. Obviously the long term remains to be seen, but the overall construction quality seems to be excellent, it is very easy to connect and I have not run into issues with one headset connecting while the other has a delay or won’t connect at all as I have with a couple other sets I’ve owned.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"These earbuds sound great, the bass is awesome. The only thing I noticed immediately was how awkwardly they sit in the ear. The body just tilts far outward as if it’s about to fall out, though it does feel secure. The angle of the speaker canal could be a little sharper so that the body fits flush along the ear but instead it just looks silly. Granted, all ear shapes are different, but I think a bendable speaker canal would make these fit better for all ear types. With that said, at least they don’t immediately fall out, which is more than I can say for the last two sets of earbuds I’ve tried, so I guess I’ll keep them.",4,1,2019-12-5,1,0,1

I was not disappointed, good sound, battery life, syncs, effortlessly, excellent range, they charge quickly from their case and the case supports wireless charging. They also don't feel 'cheap', the buds and case are all sturdy and top quality. If Tozo starts making phones, I'm in.",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"Just got these.Very happy..I am picky and impressed with the overall sound! It has good noise canceling qualities too. What I want is BASS..it delivers. Descent mids,highs. Volume is good.I use it on my bike rides and in the pool,DWR. Using The largest ear pads and a tip for better overall sound.”Burn them in “ minimum of 1 hour..this takes them next level! ( find on YouTube) Set volume 1/2 way.It will increase total volume. Good quality and buy for the money.Oh..they stay put too.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"I had a hard time figuring out which headphones I wanted to buy and I researched alot of different brands. Originally I was going to buy the galaxy earbuds but decided last minute to buy these and see how they worked, worse case scenario I would just buy the galaxy ones. I am confident that I made the right choice and saved myself almost $70.00.These ear buds work perfectly, the sound quality is great (I listen to mainly super heavy metal so I haven't tested how good the bass works in them). The Bluetooth is easy to connect and the range is good as well,( I can walk around my apartment with my phone in the kitchen and it's stays connected even upstairs). Also, the battery life is great, I listened to both earbuds for 2 days pretty much all day and they didn't die. The biggest issue I have found is, the touch screen controls. It's simple just like every other Bluetooth headset but it's very touchy, it's easy to accidentally hit the earbud and change the song but honestly that's all I can think of to say negative and it's not even really a big deal....",5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,1
"Sounded adequate but would constantly change stuff like change the track, etc. because my ears were pressing the touch panels which was annoying. The bluetooth would also fluctuate when a jet flew over or other interference which other units did not have this problem.  Sent them in for refund using Amazon's return label but UPS must have lost them? Now I'm out $42.",2,1,2020-6-8,1,1,0
"I am very happy with these headphones.  I work out 5 days a week, had the Samsung Gear IconX prior, and just got frustrated with the connection issues...not to mention I spent $200.00 on them.  The battery life on these are incredible, coupled with the charging case, I think I recharge about once a month.  They charge wirelessly, so I just put them on my wireless charging pad and that's it.I'm no audiophile, but the sound is perfect for my workouts.  It comes with different size buds, so find a fit is not a problem.  I connect via my galaxy watch and spotify and have had no issues.  For the price these headphones simply cannot be beat.  I've had them over 2 months now, and like I said I use them for my workouts 5 days a week, hikes on the weekend, and just knocking around the yard, no issues.",5,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"These are great for anyone looking for great value but not sacrificing sound quality. Both the case and the headphones have a premium feel to them. The headphones come with a variety of different ear buds from very small to very large. You'll find one that fits your ear canal easily and that will stay put as you're working out. I'm a runner and can testify that they stay in regardless of how much jostling around. The sound quality is great with good range, deep bass, and clarity across the spectrum.You can stop looking for a new set of headphones. Just buy these!",5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0

"I previously was using the T10 earbuds from Tozo, and the company offered an opportunity to test out the new T6 model in exchange for an honest review.  Although the model number is lower, I believe this is actually the latest upgraded model.  The biggest change right off the bat is the charging case is now much smaller, and they still support wireless charging.  The T10 charging case is really big by comparison and hard to fit into most pockets, while these fit into my pockets just fine.  The earbuds themselves are also a bit smaller and fit into my ears better.  I'm not a big audiophile, but the sound quality to me is just as good; perhaps there is a little less bass, but the vocals and the high notes sound better.  I've been getting decent battery life as well - about 4-5 hours on a single charge, as advertised.  The only thing I'm still getting used to are the new touch controls - although they're easier to use, it's also much easier to temporally hit them by accident when you're adjusting the earbuds.  Overall, very happy with these earbuds and will be using them instead of my T10 now - they're more comfortable due to the smaller size, and the new charging case is a huge plus too.",5,1,2019-9-29,1,0,1
"these ear buds were easy to pair to my phone. the sound quality is awesome. battery life is also good. wear them while working around the house and have no problems. multiple size ear pieces make the fit better and very comfortable to wear. the only issue I have is getting them out of the charging case, but that is because of my fat fingers.",5,1,2020-4-20,1,1,0
"These are my first true wireless earbuds.  Before this I was using the Samsung Lvl up ""wireless ear buds"" with the wire and neck holder.  I have been shopping around for true wireless earbuds and almost bought the air pods on a few occasions, but could not justify the price and I did not really like the form factor of the Jabra or other devices.  So far, the Tozo T6 has exceeded expectations. It is easy to get a comfortable fit with the extra 5 ear bud sizes.  It was extremely easy to set up and my podcasts, music, and calls are crystal clear. I feel like I upgraded from my Samsung ""wireless earbuds"" in every way.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,1,0
"I bought the TOZO T10 Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless Earbuds in May and have loved them. I sing their praises regularly. The company does a great job of keeping buyers informed on new products, so when they emailed me about their new earbuds, I was intrigued.  The TOZO T6 True Wireless Earbuds are fantastic. Smaller, lighter, more comfortable, and more noise cancelling than their predecessors the T10s. As much as I love the T10, T6 is even better. I've added images to show the packaging, the T6 wireless charging case, and then a series of images comparing the T10 and the T6. Images of the T10 are on the left, T6 on the right.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,1
"First off, I would like to say I bought these headphones to use for running after seeing the high number of good reviews and affordable price. These wireless headphones are decent for their price point and for listening while sitting or light exercise such as walking or lifting, but I would not recommend buying these for more vigorous exercise such as running. While running the headphones are constantly falling out of my ears despite me trying all of the different sized ear tips and doing the twist trick to ""lock in"" the headphone. I also tend to sweat a lot during exercise, and sometimes I run in the rain... so I bought these for their IPX8 waterproof rating. Although sweat or rain have not damaged the headphones yet, the waterproof feature is kind of useless if the headphones are constantly falling out. All the moisture just makes it easier for the headphones to fall out as well. Comfort wise, these headphones are fairly light and low profile, but since they sit in your ear canal it can cause irritation especially if you're having to frequently push them back in if they are falling out like I have experienced. I thought noise cancellation would be a cool feature, and these headphones definitely have it, but again... if you're a runner like me, I would advise against these headphones (or any noise cancelling headphones in general) because then you can't effectively hear your surroundings while running outside which could translate to a safety hazard. To any runners out there looking for a good set of wireless headphones I would recommend looking into some bone conduction headphones ones.***UPDATE 4/10/2020***",4,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"First, the good: Price, compact size, good battery life, pleasant design. Silicone ear pieces do a good job of blocking external soundThe bad: Sound quality is tinny. Every month or so, I need to remove these and repair them to my phone because it will randomly and repeatedly lose connection. Sometimes it will say ""connection lost"", sometimes it will just go quiet and then reconnect. When it does the ""quiet disconnection"", it makes me think that my phone call was going in and out of service and was very frustrating. I was wearing these while pressure washing and several times the ear buds starting beeping continuously until saying ""volume minimum""- Perhaps the water spray in the air was setting them off? These don't fit very well in my ear and the touch control is overly sensitive. Meaning that when it's falling out of my ear and I adjust it, it is very difficult to not trigger something unwanted.",3,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"I was hesitant of ordering any type of wireless earbuds.  Didn't want to spend a small fortune only to find that I might lose them by accident.  So, I did diligent review searching on the TOZO T6 earbuds.  Every review rated them highly.So, I made the leap into the world of wireless earbuds and purchased the TOZO T6 earbuds.  WOW, they are amazing.  Nicely built.  Excellent sound.  They fit snug and have other sized fittings to fit different people.  Nice charging/carry case too that can hold up to 4 additional charges without being plugged in.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"I hold back a star on sound quality because I refuse to acknowledge that Bluetooth sounds as nice as wired headphones with lossless music.That said, these are easy to pair and the sound quality is good for Bluetooth. Pairing is easy, they auto-pair with each other out of the case, and the case can be charged wirelessly.",5,1,2020-7-2,1,1,0
"Very good wireless buds. The sound quality is extremely good for the price, top notch quality through and through, from the buds themselves, to the case, to the packaging.I routinely get close to 4 hours of continuous use such as listening to music while I code, and about 6 hours if I use them intermittently.",4,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"Absolutely excellent earbuds for the price. Bravo to these guys for selling such quality at an affordable price.Sound quality is great, comparable even to headphones in the 80~200 dollar range. Only flaw I could see people discussing would be the lack of bass; I know how finicky bass bois can be about a pair of earbuds that don't cram 1000 decibels of fake amplified bass down your ears. Only way I could do better on sound quality would be to go to the professional hi-fi ranges up in the 250+ dollar plateau.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"Doesn't have true noise cancelation, more just the buds fill the ear and block a lot of background noise. For the price, though, these have very good sound and great features. I'm tired of ""wireless"" earbuds with connecting wires between the ears that eventually wear out. So far I've been delighted with these.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
I have really tiny ear canals and have a hard time finding something that doesn't hurt my ears. To top it off I also have a daith piercing that gets in the way of many earphones keeping me from putting anything in that ear most of the time. These had a fitting that fit my ears (smallest one) and also don't rub up against my piercing so I can listen comfortably. They hold a great charge and sound is good. The only complaint is that the off function only happens if you stop your music first or disconnect Bluetooth. It would be nice just to turn them off.,5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"I just received my Tozo T6 wireless headphones a few days ago, and have been very pleased with my experience thus far.Initially, I was nervous about a truly wireless earbud, as I am a runner and feared that they might not fit securely and end up falling out while on a run.  So far, my fears have been unfounded.  Using the smallest option for rubber earpiece, I found that the buds fit very snugly and comfortably in my ear.  I took them on a few walks this weekend, and then tested them out on a run this morning without any issue.",5,1,2019-11-4,1,0,1
"Once my daughters got AirPods for their iPhones and loved them, I knew I had to find a similar product for my Android phone (Pixel 2). A quick Google search landed me on the Tozo T6 page on Amazon and I was blown away by the price and the praise from all the reviewers.I was a bit skeptical as I know you can't always trust Amazon reviewers, but I have been nothing but pleased with my purchase. The Tozo Earbuds paired in seconds, fit comfortably and stay seated, and sound great. I particularly like the fact that I can use one at a time as I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks walking the dog and around the house. Keeping one ear open for an approaching car or spouse is a key use case for my personal safety.",5,1,2019-11-29,1,1,0
"These wireless earbuds are fantastic. The sound quality is better than expected, the fit is great. I used the default silicon buds, but there are others that come as replacements. I wore them yesterday while roller skating and they didn't budge despite the sweat and movement. I ordered the ""rose gold"" although, they're more a carnation pink, which I vastly prefer! The case is a convenient size too, and the lid closes securely.A couple minuscule drawbacks, which is why I didn't down vote on the stars.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"I bought these to replace some beats earbuds that I use at the gym. The set up was easy,  the sound quality was better than my beats although the volume was not as loud.  Had a hard time getting them to stay in my ear during workouts and everytime you touch them to push them back in,  you pause or skip a song.  After 3-4 weeks the right side would no longer produce sound and the left side was so quiet at max volume that you could barely hear it.  Unfortunate,  I was hopeful and loved the initial sound and bass.  Return was easy and refund was given same day.  Thank you.",2,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"For the price you are paying for them, they are good.  The audio playback is great.  The voice quality during calls are great.  The people I've called say they are clear and no issues.  The main issue I have with them are they are fairly bulky and you do get tired of wearing them after a while.  There is a secondary issue.  The case seems to want to close on the slightest whim.  I found it frustrating to open the case to either get the buds out or put them in and the case closes before I could do anything.",4,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"I absolutely LOVE these! I've searched years for wireless earbuds that would fit in my ears and tried 15+ different pairs with no luck. The TOZO t6 headphones are the only kind that fit me and are comfortable to wear for long hours. Seriously.The first day I wore them around the house while working from home for over 6 hours before they needed a charge. They charge quickly, and the carrying case is great. I've been using them every day since whether I'm working, jogging, cleaning, running errands, or relaxing on the couch -- no issues. I mostly use them for music and phone calls, of course, but I've even used them to fall asleep. My SO needs total quiet to rest, but I prefer a little background sound. Popped these earbuds in, played one of my white noise apps, and slept the night while wearing them. They never fell out, and I didn't have to hear his snoring!",5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
I wasn't expecting the awesome sound that comes out of these buds!!! They are the best out there for sure. I use them at work and I left my phone in the office and went to the office next door. I closed the office doors... Both of them... And was SHOCKED that the sound remained clear and perfect. The case / charger is the perfect size and super convenient to carry.If you are interested but unsure you want to spend the money... DO IT. I would recommend these to anyone! And definitely have as I've shown and let others be completely blown away by trying them out. Great product!!,5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,1
"I bought these as a backup for a more expensive pair of earbuds and for the price, these are the best TW earbuds I have tried.  The pairing process was exceedingly simple and encountered zero issues pairing to a Pixel 3xl, desktop pc (Techkey adapter) or Lenovo laptop.  The sound quality is acceptable, but really shines after some tweaking via a 3rd party equalizer.  The Play music equalizer can make these earbuds punch way above their price point.There are some gaps in the range, but these aren't a $300 pair of earbuds and I found them to be on par with the airpods in terms of quality.  So far, the battery life has been fantastic.  I've used them in a few multi-hour sessions and have not even received a notice that they are getting low.  As with most true wireless devices, I expect this to drop over time, but so far I am very pleased with the battery life.  Additionally, the wireless charging worked great and I was able to charge on an inexpensive 3rd party charger, a samsung puck and the pixel charger.",5,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0
"The earbuds sound great, but I have had too many problems with them. The original pair failed just past the return date. The company was great about replacing them under warranty. The replacement earbuds have now failed again in less 3 months. This time could have been bad. During charging, I noticed an odd odor. Upon inspection, the case had overheated to the point that it was starting to melt and deform. See the attached pictures. I'm glad that they were not left unattended during charging. There's always a chance of getting a bad product, but I've had two fail within 4 months, one potentially catastrophic, had it not been caught.

The bass has some punch to it, which I feel has been lacking in some of the other wireless earphones I've tried.I haven't used them for phone calls, but for music while I've been working out they have been awesome.

No plugging just lay them on the quick charge pad.Regarding earbud things, they give you 3 sets of medium, one large, one small and one extra small.",5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0

"I was very skeptical when I bought these but now I am glad i did. for 50 bucks i figured there would be a lot of down sides and i have only had two cons the mic on them is decent not the greatest but i dint really mind, do not  use them to much on the phone. The battery last awhile not bad but not crazy good i usually charge them every 3-4 days so its still really good. The sound quality is great i use them in the gym im a weight lifting type of guy, and they give me enough juice and sound to get the pump going great bass to them. I listen to all types of music rock, hip hop, spanish, edm all get me a great sound. they have never fallen out of my ear either. The huge pro is the noise canceling they cancel it out so damn well sometimes i have to lower to listen to things around me so i stayed focused while wearing them. Ive used them to weight lift, while working, playing basketball, and swam with them once i was very nervous to do it, but hey they worked great that was 3 months ago no notice on quality. I would highly reccomend these for the price, i liked them so much i bought them for my mother in law the white ones and she loves them. i didnt tell her the price though LOL.Now for the header i say they are better than air pods minus the mic they arent the best for talking on the phone and the battery life between charges. i have used my friends regular airpods and my sisters air pods the regular airpods 2nd get didnt get lough enough for me and at the time i couldnt justify the price it was too much for me. Ima budget bang for ur buck dont need the fancy name brand i want the product that is good whos cares for looks i want quality over looks and brand. Now the air pods pros i used my brother in laws and playhed the same song with mine and his in my ear honeslty for 280 or whatever they were going for i told him he got ripped off they felt the same in my ear with the design and quality was the freakin same it sounded like. I cant justify that price no thank you im very happy with mine and still use them working great bought them 6 months ago!",5,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0
"sound quality is better than expected, they're easy to charge and I like the little click when you put them back in the casethe only thing I don't like is when its sensors are sensitive and it thinks you're trying to give it a command lol. like I'll have to readjust it in my ears and it pauses/plays, or holding one in my hand to have a conversation and it shuts off & I have to fish the case out to basically reboot it. then there's the opposite problem where it's not sensitive enough to recognize me trying to skip to the next song.",4,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0

That is the one my husband apparently uses as well.  They must only fit large ears.  Cause they stay in his fine, but pop right back out of mine no matter how far I push them in. If I push any harder it will be painful.  It’s a good product but if the little one is what my 50 year old husband has to wear, I can’t imagine who would use the bigger earbuds.  Please change these so they have smaller buds.",2,1,2020-6-8,1,1,0
Awesome! Seriously. I used them at the lowest volume while husband was play his own music on  his speaker. I couldn't hear his music. My 10 yo started talking to me. I could hear him with my music playing on lowest volume of my iPhone 8 plus. I turned off the music and then i could hear him but still couldn’t make out his words. He sounded muffled. I had to take the earbud out. The sound is incredible. They are comfortable. I still need to try them out while exercising. Will update you. Battery life is great.

I don’t know where to start...I love these earbuds!!! I first purchased a pair a few months ago and I couldn’t believe how clear I could hear others and how they said they could hear me. I quickly realized  how long the battery life was because I was using them all the time!!! You can also walk away from your phone and switch a song by tapping your bud (love it!). Another feature that I love is that the buds operate as primary and secondary so while one is using up battery life the other preserves and kicks in if the primary dies! These are so awesome that I brought my mother a pair and misplaced mine and brought another pair. Look no farther you will be so happy with these.,5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,1
"I did not want to spend the money for name brand air buds so I bought these. They work great! They fit my ears and stay in place, the sound quality is great for my purpose.

I expect that on long toad trips these will be amazing as a passenger. The case has a nice weight and feels well constructed. It is easy to charge and I’ve not had to do much of that.

We aren’t that brave lol. But all in all I love these over the Bose. My husband got those and I absolutely don’t like them. The bass is low, the sound quality isnt that good compared to these.

All other bluetooth devices I have can hold a stable connection at twice the distance these start to cut out.They sound great and feel comfortable, but what's the point if they can't even hold a stable connection.

She reset them according to the instructions, and while that helped some of the touch control issues (they came out of the box as not very responsive), the sound remained poor.

After doing some research on the TOZO brand, and recently buying a Wireless Charger for my iPhone from TOZO (highly recommend), I found the TOZO T6 Earbuds to be the best quality for the price! I like the fact that the headphone case is equivalent in size and shape to the Apple AirPods, and these earbuds are much smaller! Also, the sound capability is just as good. An added bonus is the microphone quality is very impressive. I wear my earbuds when I run, and while on calls the conversation doesn’t get drowned out by background noise or wind/air, like other earbuds microphones do. These are GREAT!

I'm not sure they are at the comfort level of forgetting that i have them in, but they are comfortable enough for my use.As my first True Wireless buds I'm more than satisfied. I would definitely recommend them. I can't really rate them for battery life yet as i just started using them about 45 minutes ago, but i will try to remember to update later. I'm guessing that they came around 95% charged as they are at 90% now so they'll probably go for 6-7 hrs i would think. For the time being I'm going to rate them as 5 stars.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0

"I bought these earbuds to replace a similar pair that had a physical button. I mainly use these earbuds for commuting, and for tele-conferencing. Because I commute via motorcycle (full face helmet), the former pair would often shut off if the physical button would get pressed against the side of the helmet. Fortunately, because of the ""touch"" button on this pair, that is no longer an issue. The music quality isn't as good as my previous pair (similar cost on Amazon), but they work well enough for my needs.However, I am severely disappointed in the battery life. After being put on a standby fully charged, they lose ~25% of their charge within 2-3 days. On standby. They also lose ~25% charge after a hour-long call. Basically, they need to be charged every other day or so. In this era of forced teleworking (thanks COVID-19) I'm definitely disappointed in the limited battery life of these earbuds.",5,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0
"Overall for the price these are worth it. I wouldn’t use these for enjoying my music for leisure as the sound quality is not very good, but I use them at work so I can listen to music or videos while I work without being constrained by a cord. The sound quality isn’t great, but the noise cancellation is good. I’m very disappointed with the wireless charging capabilities. I was able to charge wirelessly with ease once, with some fiddling the second time, and haven’t been able to get them to charge wirelessly since. These EarPods did not come with a charging cord so that’s something to note. Luckily I have a wireless mouse which takes the same type of charger so I’m able to charge these EarPods. However, I keep that cord at home and the EarPods at work along with my charging pad so it’s kind of inconvenient that the wireless charging will no longer work. (It’s not the charging pad because it still works on my phone). So overall I’d say they are worth the low price but you also get what you pay for and I do wish to upgrade to Apple AirPods next time I have some extra money. These will work just fine in the meantime.",3,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"Update: they have reached out and offered me a choice of new headphones or 60 dollars in Amazon wallet. They didn't offer to fix the current headphones. Also their warranty department. So they made the defect right by refunding my purchase. The headphones still have the original 2 problems, but sound very nice and work otherwise.Original post:",4,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0
"Pro's: Great quality. Easy directions for the touch sensors. The sensors may be a little too sensitive, but this is also day 1. Also you can use just the left piece ir just the right piece. Just have to take them out of the box in the correct order.Con's: I mainly use only the right earpiece, but you can't change the volume or sound downward with just the right earpiece (right one controls up / foward, and left piece down / back) so heads up if you always need 1 ear open for safety/ work reasons. If not, it shouldn't be a problem",4,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"I wanted to use the headphones for several days before writing my review. ** Been using these true wireless headphones for 2 weeks now**So far I am enjoying them, the bass in both headphones are fantastic. I love to listen to hip hop and kpop. Connecting these headphones to my iPad and Galaxy s6 showed no issues. So far so smooth. I switched to the smallest rubber ear bud because the medium sized earbuds didn't sit quiet right for me. The smallest size is perfect. I also like how the design of the earbuds is very clean looking, no excessive bumps or striking colors.",5,1,2019-11-20,1,0,1
"So I came interested in wanting to own some wireless earbuds because of the flexibility they offer and for work. Everything else is just too pricey I mean over $100 for Samsung earbuds? I own an iPhone and I absolutely hate the air pods because of their look and how they aren’t in-ear buds (I prefer in-ear or over the ear). I’ve been pretty comfortable with skull candy for many years, but the wireless buds they offer have pretty bad reviews. As usual, I came to amazon to not only look for deals, but for quality. I found the “older” version of these Tozo earbuds and they had 13k reviews! Ultimately I thought those were the ones, until amazon guided me to these “newer” version. I definitely would go with these over the “older” version because of the box/case box size and they look like, according to my wife, an ear plug because there is no writing on the back of the earbud.These headphones are quality! I admit I was hesitant at first, I mean $60 for true wireless headphones with bass? No way! there can’t be that much bass in these tiny earbuds. Well, I was proven wrong! I’m a bass head; I prefer bass over treble, mid, vocal, whatever. I listen to just about anything from Spanish to jazz to techno and to hard style. When it comes to bass, I need the bass. I’ve tried just about tons of headphones trying to find the bass I desire and I’ve come to settle with a few choices. I have some over the ear Sony’s that really rock with bass, but they’re too big to be walking around with and much less during my work hours.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"If you want to have true wireless earbuds that perform like or better I would say than the Apple buds, this is it. Sound is phenomenal, bass is right enough, I like bass heavy sound and these earbuds do not disappoint.For making calls they are also great. Mic isolates noisy environments and makes your voice loud and clear, a little echo but that’s better than noisy background. You can use one or both at a time. The only not so great is that you cannot pair them with two devices at the same time. Look no further for this price.",4,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"I was nervous to switch to ear buds from Bluetooth headphones. I used them while driving rideshare. Then maps can read the directions without announcing through the car and my eyes stay on the road without the riders getting interrupted. That works great. But, if I get a call at home the caller can hear everything going on at my house. If someone talks next door my caller hears them when I'm outside. There's no noise cancelation on these. Outside of calls they work great and stay in place well unless I'm eating, then they fall out.",5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"First off, they were extremely well packaged and easy to pair. Immediately started playing where I left off on a podcast. Comes with everything pictured and a 18 month warranty.First impression of the sound quality is that it was a bit bass-heavy but was still tight and clean. It did bury some of the other mix because of it. Bassists and drummers would love the mix! At full volume, listening through Spotify (with ""loud"" setting and ""Very High"" quality) the buds sound pretty good overall. Great bass gives a comparison to over the ear headphones. Great noise cancellation too. For the price, they're definitely worth it but if you're a true audiophile, sure, you can get better quality buds. Just take into account, streaming MP3's is extremely compressed so it's hard to get top notch sound quality while listening to anything with this method. But for leisurely listening they're great. Perfect for workouts and runs. Nice easy controls to pause, skip tracks etc... About a 1 second latency but overall does he job well. Ocerall, worth the money, great product!",4,1,2020-5-14,1,0,1
"I have had these touchscreen Bluetooth headphones for month know and use then 3 times a week at the gym for an hour each time I use them.

"My earphones fit perfectly, comfortable, sleek, great charger, long battery life.  However, one side has 5X the volume of the other side.  I switched them and the one with low volume was still low.  I have reset my phone, tried them on other devices, had got a couple of other opinions.  And, even the loud one has low volume.

"I’ve never had a set of bluetooth earbuds before and i was a little wary of how well they’d work and how difficult they may be to operate; especially considering these didn’t have buttons. However I was presently surprised when I took then out of the package, put them into the charger to make sure they were changed, and then as soon as I took them out and paired them, they connected super fast and played wonderfully.I am also surprised as how powerful the range on the Bluetooth is. I’ve walked probably 80ft away, in a building, and they still held a strong connection.",5,1,2020-8-21,1,1,0
"Update: The manufacturer reached out and replaced the headphones without me even having to return them. Can't say that has ever happened before, I'm content with the result!I was inlove with them at first, but after comparing sound quality with my phones wired headphones i can tell they are quite inferior. They are comfortable in the ear but not good enough to have them more than two hours. Also the wireless charging is very difficult to set up, you have to set it on the right spot by milimiters and it becomes to do this every single time you want to charge them. Finally, the left headphone stopped working after 1 day of use which i'm sure it's not common but it happened with the headset i received.",5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"I can't believe how good these earbuds are. The pair very fast, they're easy to manipulate and the battery lasted 6 hours listening to music. They fit very tightly in my ears and I can't hear any outside noises when listening to music. Everyone I called said that they could hear me clearly and the functions are precise, left and right buds are loud. Bass is great. The case is small and I can fit it in the little change pocket of my Jean's. The wireless charging is quick, lights let you know when it's done.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"Sound is fantastic!! I’ve only had them a day but so far these work very good! These are the pink ones and they go very well with my Apple Watch. They come in a nice box with 5 other sized ear covers, besides what was on them, to fit a variety of ear sizes. I had no problem putting them in my ears or keeping them in! Make sure to follow directions for wearing the earbuds because you do have to insert them properly and then turn them in order for them to fit properly. From what I see so far, these were a fantastic buy!! If anything else comes up I will update this review but so far I love them!!",5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
"So far so good, amazing earphones. I’ll check back in a couple weeks, seems to be the mark for others when they break. I’m a runner and like to listen to music, but as much as I sweat I prematurely kill a lot of earphones. many Bluetooth dont last past 3 weeks. I am a headphone Connoisseur as a ride a motorcycle and it’s hard to find some that fit under a helmet. These fit great and I can slide my helmet right on, very tiny. I had an expensive pair of shure 215 bt1 that sounded great but broke after a week. (The bt1 cable) . The sound quality of these I’d say is comparable to the shure. Very impressed for the price. As loud as you need them to be, I can’t even tell they are wireless, no video lag as well. So impressed, got these bc of the price point when I was ordering yet again another cable for my shure 215’s , saw all the reviews and figured that many people can’t be wrong, they where not.Cons:",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,1
"These were purchased in February and they worked great. However by August one earbud had stopped working. Multiple requests to TOZO have gone unanswered. If they ever do respond I will have the product replaced, but I would be hesitant to purchase another product based on the reliability.Updated 9/20/2020: Once I was able to contact TOZO a replacement was sent very quickly. The product sound quality is excellent and works well. I would be happier if the product worked for longer than a few months and there was no need to contact customer service. They did ask to see a copy of my '5-star review' before sending a replacement but didn't hesitate to send the new ones when I wrote that I would wait until the replacement arrived.",4,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"I took these headphones on a two hour run right out of the box and had no issues!There's multiple earbud caps, so I was able to find one that fit my ears well, and they never once felt like they would fall out.

These are great little earphones. The sound quality is great. Although they do not get as loud as some other earphones. These are still loud.  They I deed are water proof. I one day had to jump in the river to get my kid because it was deeper than we thought and he started to go under. I carry the charger everywhere too. It unfortunately is NOT waterproof. It still works. But only one side. Meaning only one earbud slot now works and it only charges if plugged in.,5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"I bought these thinking that for $50 I might get a half way decent pair of wireless earbuds. Man was I pleasantly surprised. The TOZO T6 is comfortable, has amazing sound quality and noise cancellation that in my opinion is BETTER than AirPods. I've listened to these and compared them with my daughter's $180 AirPods and I don't see why anyone would spend the extra money. The ONLY place the AirPods may have a slight edge is with the touch navigation on the earbuds. But even that is barely a noticeable difference. I'd buy these again and again.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
These buds are absolutely fantastic. I actually am an audiophile and these sound as good as or better than my wife’s Apple EarPods. Mids and highs are crystal clear and the bass is very prevalent and sounds like it’s beating in your chest. I had another brand that resembles Apple and only paid $29. They were horrible and I returned them yesterday. The TOZO T6 are $50 and they are terrific. A bonus is the wireless charging for which I already have a charger pad for my iPhone and can be used for this. I am using these buds for my phone and also for my iMac.,5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
Bought these yesterday. They arrived this morning. I charged them up for about an hour then easily paired them with my Samsug  Galaxy 20. I went out for a motorcycle ride.. i have a very loud beefy bike the noise canceling was excellent. Much better than expected for such small ear buds. great. My other ear buds don't work nearly as well. Volume and sound quality were great. Love the IPX8 waterproofing looking forward to lounging in the pool on a raft and listening to my tune.,5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,1
I bought these earbuds to use for exercise and work. I'm on calls a lot at work and can use both or one at a time on calls and they work great. The charging case is small and extremely convenient to use and carry with me in the office or traveling. I also use them when exercising and they are very convenient and great for exercise. Pick the right earbud tips to get the right fit and they are great outside for biking/running. I like the fact that they are waterproof so sweat does not seem to affect them at all. Great value and great performance!,5,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0

"These are my first pair of wireless earbuds, so I have nothing to compare them to, but they are great. Touch functions are a nice bonus, once you learn what does what. Charging case is great and keeps them from getting lost. Calls are very clear, and I recently learned I can say ""Hey Google"" and my phone will activate (I assume Siri will work, too). The sound is MUCH louder than wired earbuds (medium volume = low volume), so be careful the first time using them.",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
So far so.. great! I just got them today 05/05/20 about a few hours and I immediately opened them. The sound quality is amazing and the bass is awesome! So far the battery is holding up and everyone can actually hear me pretty clearly. These are imperative when I'm looking for earbuds. I havent tried them in the shower yet to see how it holds up around water but I'll include that in my update. This my 1st time spending over 30 bucks for earbuds so I wanted to do a lot of searching through reviews. I love the charging case. It's so compact and I love that I get to charge my earbuds on the go when I'm out. I will definitely order another pair for my bestie. I'll update in the coming months.,5,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"These are a good buy for the price. They pair nicely and I didn't have any trouble with the connection between the earbuds and the phone. The sound is tinny, as you might expect from earbuds at this price point, but they do the trick for listening to podcasts, etc. Sadly, I won't be able to use these for my intended purpose - despite the multiple earbud tip sizes provided with the product, they fall right out of my ears while I am running or walking. I wish I could return them. I'll continue my long search for running-friendly bluetooth earbuds.",3,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0

Sound quality is good for the money and battery can last half day without recharging. Come with 3 sets of tips, so you can choose ones best for your ears. I did have issue with WIFI disconnection at beginning. Did a hard reset, and didn't solve the issue. Went to TOZO store website to down load and upload the lasted firmware onto earbuds, then the WIFI disconnection issue seams gone. Only one suggestion for the product improvement, a better ear shape design will provide better comfortable wearing and snug fit. Overall, I would recommend it product.",4,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Great sound, great price. I was wanting something truly wireless without the airpod price and these are a great option. I wear them to run in and have never had a problem with them feeling loose, which was one of the things I was worried about. The charge lasts quite awhile since I usually only use them for workouts or yard work. I used them while talking to someone on the phone recently and offered to use the phone instead of the headphones if the sound quality was bad on their end and was told by the listener that they didn't have any problems hearing me or with background noise. I highly recommend these.",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"These are the first earbuds I have every purchased and I'm very happy with them.  They fit well (and include lots of different sizes of rubber ear pieces), sound quality is good and controls seem as advertised.  After about 5 days of use, they seem to have good battery life, the case has good battery life as well - I have yet to recharge the case after 5-6 hours of intermittent earbud use with storage in the case.  No trouble pairing with multiple devices.  Very much as advertised so far and seems a good value for the money.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"This is my first set BT ear buds and I have to say I am pretty impressed with them.  I have only used them for 2 days now and other than the common complaint of ""its difficult to remove them from the battery case"" they perform flawlessly.  I have tested their range and found they can easily transmit 30 feet in the open and even out to 20 feet after going through 3 interior wall...no signal loss or degradation.  Removing them from the case is only difficult for the first bud as I have large fingers and the buds are rather slippery.  Its definitely not a deal breaker by any means.  In comparison to my daughters Apple buds I think I have better connectivity than she does.  That however could be that we both have Samsung Note 8's and several of the Apple functions simply don't work on Android (shame on Apple for that).  The Tozo T-6 works flawlessly with my Note 8 so far.  One feature that almost had me purchase another brand, was the ability to purchase a single replacement bud.  The other brand offers single bud purchases on Amazon, and as far as I could tell Tozo did not.  Well as it turns out you can buy a single bud from Tozo, but only on their TozoStore site, not Amazon.  I have not done that yet, but its good to know  its possible.  I believe the price per bud was something like $22 US, which I think is reasonable.  Overall I am very happy with my purchase.",4,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"I am very pleased that I chose to buy this truly wireless pair of earbuds. The setup was extremely easy, with a great build quality to boot.  The sound quality is extremely great, I like crossover opera which needs rich mids and highs not just thumping base and these deliver. The touchpads work as advertised making it very convenient when using with my phone. I was also pleased when using them while on a phone call, the microphone worked better than any other I have ever used. I would definitely recommend these to a friend.",5,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"These really are awesome little earbuds! The sound is exceptional and they are very comfortable compared to a couple other brands I've tried.

They are charging well on my Samsung wireless charging pad.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,1,0
"After using these headphones for a little under a week, I already love them more than my old Jabra Halo as the bluetooth connection is fantastic. There's been no crackling or disconnects when listening to music or using my phone for calls so far which has restored a bit of my faith in bluetooth. The range is also really good as I've been able to leave my phone in the basement, walk upstairs and out the front door (on the other side of the house) while still listening to music.One feature that I thought was included, and may be the reason why I return these headphones in the end, is that you can pair them with only one device at a time; I thought I saw this question answered as ""yes"" in the product questions. Being able to pair my Jabra Halo with both my work computer and phone means that I can listen to music from either device or take a call from either device without changing out my headphones. Not having that feature has been a surprisingingly big loss to my everyday workflow which is disappointing.",3,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"Just took delivery. Took them out of the case and put the case on a charger. The headset paired up easily. Piece of cake.

"This is my first ever pair of wireless earbuds, so I don't have a frame of reference for comparison, but I am a lifelong lover of music and I've always cared about sound quality. While the sound quality with these doesn't necessarily blow me away, for this price point I find them pretty satisfactory. They'll serve their purpose, which for me will be casual listening while walking around or working out. I wish they would get a bit louder than they do, but they block out external noise pretty well to compensate for the lack of high volume. My only real complaint is the touch sensor. It's very easy to accidentally pause your media, or inadvertently skip tracks, while you're simply adjusting the bud in your ear. I don't really see why they need buttons at all since you control them with a device, but if they're gonna have buttons it would probably just be better to have an actual physical button to help avoid accidental button pressing. I like the case, which magnetically snaps shut and is compact enough to easily slip into a pocket. I give these a 3 out of 5, and for $45 in a market where earbuds can get into the several hundreds, I consider that a pretty good rating, dollar for dollar.",3,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
"There are a bunch of good reviews with pictures and videos here. I will try to give details not mentioned too often for these. So far, for the money, this is an outstanding set of earbuds. My friend let me try the T10s she has for a few days. I was impressed by those and these were an upgrade as far as I am concerned. There are a few differences. The T6s will allow you to connect through either earbud no matter if the other is off. They both have a mic so for phone use, you can get many hours of use while one constantly charges. They are ambidextrous so it doesn't matter which ear you use for this. However the touch controls won't change so the long touch on the left will only ever turn down the volume for example. The range on these with my phone is more than advertised. I have had a solid connection though cinderblock walls and 40 feet away from my phone. These came with many options for ears of all sizes. These connected faster than the T10s. The T10s did speak the phone numbers of incoming calls and indicated when connected to the caller with a tone, these do not. The case is nice and compact so it will fit in my pocket nicely. Really impressed! Seems like a good warranty as well. I will update this review later once I have used these for a while.",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"What great little Bluetooth headphones! These are actually quite comfortable. They come with several sets of soft cap-like cushions so you can “custom fit” them to your ears and what is comfortable for you. I use mine several hours a night and the battery lasts for me almost a week before I need to recharge them. I bought a set for my daughter who doesn’t use hers as much as I do mine and she does not have to charge hers very often at all, maybe once for every 3-4 times that I charge mine. Anyway, I do recommend this set of wireless earbuds.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"These headphones are top notch. Sound quality is better than average considering the price. I'm in love with how you can charge the case on a wireless pad, and then the case continues to charge the headphones. The battery life is stellar- never died in the time I owned them. I did run into an issue after about 8 mos and the manufacturer agreed to promptly replace them for free. Waiting on the new set now and will update this review when I receive them! ***update: after completing a warranty claim on their website, I received a new set within a week. One thing I thought was a little strange was that they asked me to write this review as a condition of receiving a new pair under warranty.

They seem on a even level with the significantly more expensive apple AirPods. Sound is fantastic.",5,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
I love these buds. Ive wanted wirelfess buds for a while but wasn't sure where to start. I do a lot of skating so I was worried about losing them but I've never owned earbuds that stay in my ear better than these do. Connection was flawless and almost immediate. No spotty signal either. Could use slightly more bass but thats the ONLY thing I have to say thats not a 5 star aspect but that being said its a 4 star aspect which is still good. I was also thoroughly impressed with the noise cancelation! I originally bought these as my tes t product before I invested in Samsung buds but truth be told I think I am just going to stick with these!,5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,1

"I can not say enough great things about these little, yet powerful ear buds. I immediately unboxed them because I was so excited after buying a pair of ear phones that were not so great, and these had great reviews. And WOW! I was blown away by the sound of these. I enjoy listening to my music loudly, and I have these at a volume level of less than half way, and it is plenty for me! The quality is great, the sound is great, I could not recommend these. They have multiple sizes of each rubber ear piece, which is great as I and I’m sure many others have struggled finding ear buds that fit just right. I was debating on buying a new pair of beats ear phones (old ones broke), or even Bose as I have heard nothing but great things, but honestly these are amazing and I would recommend to anyone looking for a great, quality product, at an amazing price. I look forward to using these at the pool, on bike rides, and while traveling!",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0

Where do I begin? Just got my T6 this morning. Beautifully packaged. Excellent product quality. Amazing audio with clear stereo sound. I love the size and secure fit in my ears. The touch controls are ideal. and work flawlessly. The battery life is incredible. I have no idea when they will need recharging again. It still says 100% after using them for a little over an hour. They paired so fast too. I am really pleased and highly recommend these. You won't be disappointed. Certainly worth more than the asking price too. Thank you TOZO.,5,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"I had the T10, and this T6 was offered as a free gift from Tozo for an honest review.I was very pleased with my original T10 headphones, and I was afraid that these smaller T6 headphones would sacrifice sound quality or battery life to achieve their smaller size. After a couple weeks of use, I am pleasantly surprised that the battery life is actually greater than the T10 headphones and the sound quality is still great. The smaller headphones are very comfortable. I also like that with the T6 headphones I can use either the right or left headphones individually. With the T10 headphones, if you want to only use a single earbud you have to use the right one.",4,1,2019-10-9,1,0,1
"UPDATE 2: After experiencing an initial problem with the earbuds' wearability, happy to say the company has responded to resolve the issue satisfactorily. Good customer service!UPDATE: unfortunately, I had to return it. After just 1 month of use, the case is losing the battery and the connectivity once or twice with the device is connected to.",5,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
"These headphones are great!  But the controls are a little wonky.  You are better off using the device rather then the headphones to control audio playback & pick up & answer calls.  But the sound is incredible.  The the way they sit comfortably & securely in your ear is awesome.  I would still recommend them if you need something with the controls in the headphones, in a pinch.  But Tozo does have better models!I have been made aware that my headphones may have been defective & will update my review after replacing my old headphones!",4,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
I was blown away by this set of earbuds.  They sound superb.  They came already charged and paired to my Samsung S10 effortlessly.  There are several set of ear size rubber inserts.  Fits comfortably and snugly.  Read the instructions on how to insert them into your ear .  I gave them 4 stars for the ease in removing them from their charging case.  The plastic sides of the buds are a bit slippery so it takes a bit of finagling to remove them but most certainly not a show stopper... I'm very pleased with the purchase. They sound every bit as good as a $150 pair...  And they are IPX8 waterproof rated... Cant go wrong with this purchase....,4,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"Update: TOZO reached out to me and the customer service was excellent. I received a replacement pair and they connect and disconnect perfectly. Everytime. The fit in my ear canal is great and these produce a nice full sound with a great seal in my ear. The battery life has been wonderful with me only having to charge them once every 12 days or so with everyday usage. For the price the style, the fit and the sound these are the best true wireless Earbuds I’ve owned. I’ve had Apple, Sony, Klipsch and one other brand I can’t remember but all of them were returned and refunded at some point. It’s either a fit issue or a connectivity issue with wireless earbuds. TOZO has found a way to make a small and comfortable pair of earbuds that sound good and have a great ease of use.My previous score was a 3. More like a 2.5, now I’m confident in giving them a full 5.",5,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0
"I've had these earbuds a little over a month. I use these on both my S10+ and S8. I like the fact that it charges wirelessly, even through my S10+'s power share feature. I like the call quality as well,Haven't had a complain from the people on the other end. The case is pretty 😎 cool, i like the quality of it. I love the size of them as well. They dont stick out nearly as much as other wireless earbuds I've tried. Only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the volume. At max volume setting, it's just s bit under what I'm used to. Besides that, they are awesome.",4,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0
"Mono function only - in one ear. Factory reset twice. Mono only in one ear or the other. The sound projecting from these units is very poor, similar to the $5.oo ear buds I have.  The part that fits in your ear, does not fit in the ear. I have a high quality brand wired earphones ER3 XR that fit very nicely in the ear canal and are comfortable enough to wear all day, so I know it is possible to manufacture high quality products that produce superior sound, stay firmly in the ear and are very comfortable. These produce horrible sound, will not stay in the ear and feel like someone is sticking their thumbs in your ears, or at least trying to.",1,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
"I ordered a T6 and Amazon delivered it a day before the promised day! Thanks Amazon!Before zeroing in on the T6, I read multiple reviews, researched several other models. With more than 12k reviews for T6 and close to 40k reviews on T10, I hesitantly placed an order for the T6. It was delivered well ahead of the promised date, I open it and the buds pair instantly! I pair with my iPhone X, all so seamlessly. The extra size earbud tips came in handy to be used by my daughter. We will come to that part later. I put on the music, cannot complain. I made a few voice calls, bingo. The speakers, the mic are all flawless. I am not into acoustics and music to comment on how shallow something is or how the bass missed on a particular detail. I enjoyed and am enjoying these earbuds. Lightweight, snugly fit in the ears, stereo sound, water proof. For $50, should I be complaining for these earbuds being master of none? They are jack of all trades.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0

"I have TOZO’s previous model T10 ear buds and bought these T6 buds for their longer battery life, and I wasn’t disappointed - I’ve been getting well in excess of 3+ hours play time allowing me to watch full-Length movies with plenty of power to spare. Note re TOZO’s attempt to add volume control and play-next functionality to these tiny earbuds — every time I touch them to put them more firmly in my ear I trigger one of these actions or stop the music or video all together. TOZO, please consider removing this faulty And unnecessary functionality and going back to basics with an otherwise great product. KISS (just keep it simple.)",4,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"I'm surprised at the sound quality considering that they're wireless.  They sound better than my wired cheap Panasonic headphones that I actually bought here on Amazon.  The T6's are comfortable and had no trouble pairing with each other or my Pixel 3.  They are a fingerprint magnet and a bit difficult to take out of their case.  They pair right away every time you take them out.  The tapping controls gets getting used to but noticed that it takes 1-2 seconds for tapping controls to respond and the call lag when speaking to someone is about less than 1 second but overall I'm very pleased and hope that both the case and buds last me more than a year.  I would give these 4.5 stars only because of the fingerprint magnet, the struggle to get them out of the case and the tapping controls lag.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"First the good - have had the a few weeks only.They fit very good, I have tiny ear canals and I use the smallest size and have no problem keeping them in.

"I love these earbuds. The color is more like this swatch and another reviewers pic, that’s why I decided on this color. It’s prettier than the pic posted. The battery lasts so long and the case battery lasts a long time too. Other wireless earbuds I’ve had do not last near as long. They are a bit touchy the way the control is made. When adjusting in my ear, because earbuds always move, I accidentally pause and stuff. Works well when talking on the phone as well.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,1
"An overall amazing true wireless earbud, especially for its price. Additionally, amazing customer service makes the product even more reliable. I haven't tested the battery life yet, however it seems to be just as advertised. The quality of the material is really good, and I can't really feel the difference between the TOZO T6 and the more premium true wireless options. It's ridiculously easy to use, with great instructions and with no apparent design flaws. The noise cancellation is ensured by the fact that the earbuds comes with 7 different sizes of ear tips of great quality.Update:",5,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
"Love the Tozo T-6! The sound is well balanced despite the bass boost claim. It does those low end bass and kick frequencies justice. They rarely die on me that I have to charge once every 3-4 days. The buds themselves have great battery life and I sometimes where them to sleep and wake up and they still have battery. When I put them in and want to get away I peacefully listen to my music, movie or video without worrying about outside noise. I love the volume range on them too! I rarely put them half way unless I use them for a workout! Would definitely recommend to anyone in search of a affordable quality product! I personally like them better than my Air Pods👀",5,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0
"The earbuds are very sharp looking and feel good when you put them in. The controls for the earbuds are not as difficult as I was expecting. Will definitely take a little bit to get used to but it’s not very difficult. Used them for the first time while I was on the treadmill and they were amazing. Great sound, couldn't even tell they were in my ear if they hadn't been playing music. The only thing I don’t like which isn’t a very big deal is the voice when you skip forward or go back when listening to music. It sounds weird but again, not a big deal. Love the wireless charging function and the waterproof of the earbuds. Will probably but another pair. One for work and one for home.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"This is my first pair of wireless earbuds of any kind.  I like them but there are definately a lot of things to get used to, like:  1. not being able to hear much with them in even when there is no music playing.  I'ts like wearing ear plugs. 2. You will accidentally skip songs if you try to adjust the earbud and touch the sensor..  3.  They aren't super loud.Overall though, I really like them and i am excited to use them during activities like mountain biking and hiking.",4,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"After reading many positive reviews here, I expected to love these, but after a week’s steady use I’m less than impressed / kind of disappointed. They sound good (not great) so there’s no real complaint there. That’s as far as my praise goes though. The comfort is not really great despite the many different sizes of earbuds they provide. The touch controls work ok but they’re very laggy which you get used to, but overall disappointing. One of the most annoying qualities is the voice that tells you things like, ""Connecting"" or ""Power On"". In one ear the voice sounds completely drunk and speaks verrrry slowly saying things like ""Secondary"" or much more often ""Backwards."" It's really disconcerting. I wanted to love these but I don't, at all, and cannot recommend them when there are better choices in the same price range. I'd skip these.",2,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"I love these earbuds, they look great and have a fantastic sound quality. Usually just use one in my left ear at work, get about 5hrs+ before it needs to charge again. Charging only take about an hour. I've used them in the shower and they work great. Phone calls are also very clear which I wasn't 100% expecting. Build quality feels very nice and looks attractive. Don't hesitate to buy these over the $20 cheap ones you see at stores. They are well worth the $$ and would buy again.",5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0

"I LOVE these earbuds.  FINALLY, earbuds that sound great in the gym.  I was skeptical after ordering the Echo Buds last week and being sorely disappointed with the lack of sound volume and zero bass at the gym.  However, these Tozo buds are less than half the cost of the Echo Buds and produce a tremendous amount of volume and bass.  I haven't tested the phone call quality but I rarely use my headphones for phone call since my truck is Bluetooth enabled and I can use my phone hands free while I drive.  The ONLY negative is that the touch sensor on the headphones that control volume, next/previous track selection, and pause/play capabilities is very sensitive, so much that sometimes my ear triggers the button.  We'll see if this becomes a problem and I might go with the TOZO T10 instead that supposedly have hard buttons.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
Great wireless headphones great priceI got my husband a pair for fathers day - he does pools and works outside so needless to say he sweats a lot so the last pair I got him broke within a day - I found this pair figured we’d try them and they are THE BEST - range is awesome his phone can be in the truck and the buds still work and so far in the 90 degree heat busting his but sweating they have stayed in perfect condition- I also ordered a wireless charger by tozo and hands down best wireless charger yet we tried the anker ones and they broke within a week - GREAT PRODUCTS ALL AROUND - FAIR PRICING - GOOD PACKAGING,5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,1
"These earphones have pretty good sound quality, and the range is surprisingly long. They stay in my ears pretty well, especially compared to other similarly priced wireless headphones. My main use for these is at the gym and running, and although they shift around a little bit (especially on deadlifts), I haven't had any problems with them coming out. Also, I tried these in the shower and the waterproofing is great.These aren't the most compact earphones ever but they're not bulky either, and they look sleek.",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"These ear buds are absolutely incredible. The sound is crisp and clear with an exceptional balance between bass, miss, and highs. It feels like I’m at a personal concert. Once fitted with the correct size ear piece, these earbuds are also very stable and don’t move an inch even when I’m running or doing yoga.  The touch controls are very responsive and recognize touch accurately. They were very easy to pair and I assume fully charged out of the box, as there were no instructions to charge right away.",5,1,2020-4-20,1,1,0
"The sound quality is great, the interchangeable ear pieces is great, and it surprisingly has a good amount of bass. I've had no problems using it to make or end calls, and I've been told that the mic sounds great and they have no trouble hearing me. Skipping, pausing, rewinding and raising the volume work like you'd expect it to. I love the way the charging case feels, its solid and the magnetic lid snap is very satisfying. It has four little white lights at the bottom to let you know the charge level. When I plugged them in to charge, in less than an hour it seemed to go from level 1 to 4. Very fast charging! I'm so impressed with these earbuds that I'm getting the pink ones for my fiancee's birthday that's in May. If you're not a big fan of the way Apple's airpods feel and prefer the in the ear fit, this is an excellent alternative for the price.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"I am going to give you an honest, unbiased normal dude reviews here. These things are kick a+s awesome. Charged in under an hour. Took me 3 minutes to figure out the controls. Turned em on, paired to the phone and slowly inserted into my sensitive canals. BOOM instant, great sounding music. The bass is exactly what I expected from a device this size, the volume at Max is what it is, not going to blow out your drums but plenty loud enough, especially with the nose cancelling fit. I am a very, very satisfied customer.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"Within 30 minutes of use the right earbud speaker is blown.  Never had the volume all the way up as these earbuds did a good job at canceling ambient outside noise.  Decided to wear them for a light workout.  Just over half volume is when you can notice the blown speaker.  They sounded decent before the speaker blew.  First time ordering earbuds vs headphones in a long time.  I’ve never had good luck with earbuds.  With the Amazon reviews and YouTube video reviews, this brand looked promising (especially the wireless charging potential).  Stay clear, there are other earbuds that I’m sure will last longer than 30 minutes.",1,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"I bought the version before this one and they lasted about a year before they started acting up. That's when I saw there was a newer version I could get in a fun color. So after having them for a few days I would loose link connection at least once a day. Now its happening 2-3 times a day. Which is super annoying because when I have to reconnect them I have to stop what I'm doing, wait for the computer to say they are disconnected which takes 30+ seconds, and then I have to reconnect them manually. Sad to say this since I really liked this brand and they have really great sound quality.",2,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"I was hesitating and confused if I should get t10. I’m pretty sure it’s a great product since it’s got tons of reviews. But I decided to pull the trigger on t6. An I’m very happy with my choice. It paired with my iPhone before I even put both earbuds in my eats. Construction looks solid. Sound is great, on par or even better then Airpods. Noises from outside are basically non existent. Small case. Touch sensitive controls that I didn’t even try. Waterproof. I’m writing this review while I’m listening to techno and it’s so good, that I’m straggling to write a review. Great product. Don’t hesitate, and buy it. It’s great.",5,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0
My wife originally bought the T10 set and I didn't want ours to get mixed up. I decided to go with the T6 after reading some of the reviews that they fit better in the ear. I also enjoy the touch sensors as they won't wear out as much as physical buttons.Sound quality is AMAZING! I have always been  skeptical of bluetooth and the sound quality it can move but wow...these little earbuds pack a punch. I mainly listen to metal/hard rock and I have yet to hear sound distortion while playing some pretty heavy tracks.,5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,1
"I purchased these earbuds for running. For this purpose, they're great -- they stay snug in my ears and produce a great quality sound. The touch command function is very useful when I'm out on a run, too.The only problem I have with them -- and it's a pretty big one -- is that the two earbuds won't charge equally. I purchased these buds in May of 2020, and I noticed this problem starting mid-July of 2020.",2,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
The T6 hold a solid 5-6 hour charge and then can be popped back into the case to pick up additional charge time even when not plugged into a wall outlet.

"I wasn’t sure about these headphones but they seemed to have great reviews so I figured I’d check them out. What a surprise! It is very compact and I like my music loud so a little over half the volume level sounds really good. It doesn’t have noise cancellation or where you can hear your surroundings like a hear through feature, but I love these. I had some Jabra 75t and these are better as far as functions and having touch to change a song instead of pressing a button in. Also they charge pretty quickly. Only thing I would have liked to see is an app that allows you to adjust the EQ and A feature to be able to turn off the voice responses and change it to beeps, because the voice response you get when you want to go forward or back a song, sounds sometimes like she is talking in slow motion and it has a delay at times, but you only hear it when you change the song with your earbuds, so it’s not that big of a deal for me just was something I noticed.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"I bought these earbuds to help motivate me to work out.....they definitely provided that motivation I was looking for.  They stayed in my ears without ever moving.  The sound is awesome.  Perfect balance of treble and bass.  I personally like good bass and these provide that as well.  Price was amazing to me ...I had been looking at some that were just rediculously expensive.  These are really priced great.  I also had to contact customer service through Tozo.  Their response was very quick.  They solved my problem, no questions asked, just 100% customer satisfaction.

"I have several pairs of wireless headphones I use while crunching numbers at work f/12 hour days. My office is very busy, noisy and distracting. The earpods I had were cumbersome & the battery life was weak. I wanted pods that would primarily cancel background noise so that I would be less distracted. I also wanted better battery life. I'm pleased beyond words. I'm most pleased with the battery life & that it doesn't matter which earpod I use. The sound is amazing, can listen to either pod or both without battery life dying, fast forward or backward on songs, noise cancellation great, all around fantastic including the price.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of product and sound so far. Have only used them for a little bit, but have continued to impress with each test. I have purchased a couple other wireless headphones and these have surpassed where others tend to fall short.  I can even use these for calls as others I have tried all sounded so bad to people on the other end I didn't bother with them any more.  Also, bass shocked me with the first song I put on.

"For 30% of the cost of AirPods, I got a pair of buds that have better sound quality, comfort, and style. These were originally $49.99, but I got a 10% discount that reduced it to $42.Audio Quality: The mids and highs were great, the lows were alright but most earbuds struggle with that anyways and I'm not a basshead. They're not Jabra Elites, but the audio quality alone makes these worth more than $50. The fit of the buds also offer decent passive noise cancellation, perfect for commuting.",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"I was hesitant to purchase these because I do a lot of skiing and biking and was wary of earbuds like this falling out. I had been considering the Powerbeats pro, which have an ear hook to keep them secure, but there were very few cheap alternatives available in that style that were well reviewed. With the right tip on these however they really suction right into your ear canal and I have to really pull on them to get them out of my ear. This may be less secure when the tips become wet with sweat, but I haven't had that happen yet. Sound is pretty clear, and the noise isolation is very good with the right tip. I really wish these had more bass. Not that I generally go for super bass heavy headphones, but these just lack that little punch. The case is just like the AirPods case, but the buds are really tough to get out of the case. Battery life seems pretty good, but I haven't tested it fully yet. The touch controls are intuitive and easy to use. The volume control is pretty limited so you'll have to rely mostly on volume control from your device. Pairing was easy and they automatically pair when you take them out of the case after the first pairing, so there's no screwing with bluetooth settings every time you want to use them, which is how all my old bluetooth headphones were and really deterred me from using them. With an amazon coupon these were under 50 and seem worth the price. I might have been a little annoyed with the sound quality if they were any more expensive than that though.",4,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"Wanted to get a more expensive pair but was shown these. I had my doubts (for some reason) but when I got them I really liked them. My only worry was that they were a bit too bulky- but I realized very soon after that that was because I was wearing them upside down (I am a smart human being). They paired easily with my Samsung phone as soon as I took them out of the case. The charging port is on the bottom and you have to just pry the rubber of it up and twist it out (the bit won't fully come out, it's connected to the case). Charging works great, and I've used them a whole day without them dying. Would recommend to others.",5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
I’ve only been using them for about an hour now and I am already in love with them. Pairing was seamless.  The sound quality is very good. I FaceTime with my family and the sound is clear with no problems.  The music plays crisp and clear and I am very pleased especially for the price. They fit in my ear pretty snug ...I will update this after I go exercise with them on to see how stable they are in my ear.  Wireless charging is a great feature.  They do compare with my high end earphones. I would suggest this to others.,5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
The quality of the sound is excellent. The bass is proper good.Comfort is iffy. Sometimes they fit in my ear perfectly and sometimes they slip out and fall depending on what I'm doing. I don't jog or anything; so these work perfectly for me. But if you are bopping your body around a lot; these will probably slip.,4,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"I ordered these to use in the office to avoid knocking stuff over with my previous corded headphones. Sound quality is great for the price. Battery life so far is also very good. I typically just use one earbud at a time so I can hear if somebody across the cube farm is talking to me, so I usually use 1 for half of the day and then swap and put the other one back on the charger. They are very comfortable, and seem to stay in my ear very well. Comes with plenty of different options to fit into your ear. Every once in awhile I'll bring them to the driving range/putting green to listen to music while practicing and they have performed very well in that capacity as well. Life is too short to knock stuff over with cords, these  T6 wireless earbuds are well worth it, and I'm honestly going to order another pair eventually and just leave one in the office.",5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
If you have any connection issues just do the reset and they will be great!Right out of the box I connected to my Apple watch and went for 3 miles. The entire time the sound was cutting in and out.

"I got them today. Plugged them in to charge while I slept to go to work. Around 8pm. Is when I got up. Have been using them since then till now at 12:20. So far the sound is amazing. They are light and dont bother the ear. Has good bass. Only down side is the mic needs to be a little bit more sensitive. Have to speak rather loudly for people to hear me.

"These headphones come in a very neat presentation; product has weight to it and you don't feel as if you have a play-set flimsy version, don't let their small size fool you! it also has 5 different sized rubber tips to adapt the best fitting one to your ear. They look very sophisticated and do not look big when using them. The charging case has an adequate size, and it's not too cumbersome when inside your pockets. Sound quality is amazing, bass is definitely felt, and to me it sounds rich; voice quality is great as well. Connecting to your phone or laptop is fairly easy, and the touch functions are very intuitive, too.As for the cons: The touch controls are very sensitive, and if they feel even the slightest bit of water or sweat, they stay activated on the function that lowers or increases volume, so using them in the shower is really a hassle. Washing them dampens the sound quality for a couple hours (but at least I know they're definitely water resistant). Also, the microphone quality is bad, to be honest e.g. voicenotes sent on whatsapp sound abysmal. I've had them for about two and a half months and the sound quality is not the same anymore, but I take some of the blame on that end.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"These are okay, but pretty overrated in my opinion. I loved them the first few hours. You have to get the exact right size buds to make them not constantly slip out but even if you do they always feel like they’re going to stop out. So working out in them is pretty annoying. When you try to adjust them to stop them from falling out the touch pad often skips forward or back, or starts your video over or skips to a new one. The sound gets out of sync regularly . You have to forget the device, put them back in the case, hold them a certain way for like 15 seconds and then rediscover the device. It’s just a pain. I have these 20 dollar skull candy head phones I ended up using instead just because the other ones kept sounding all jacked up. The left one would be noticeably lower than the right unless i did the mentioned above. The battery lasts a long time. The case is sexy. I love the white lighting contrasting with the matte black case. It’s just, I have to mess with them way too much and even though I’ve tried many different size ear buds I either have to jam them further into my ear than I’m comfortable , or just constantly adjust them , often causing a song skip I’m just done with them. I literally don’t want them.",2,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"I really wanted to like these.  Regardless of which earbuds I tried, When I was wearing them and not listening to anything, anytime I took a step there would be this screech like feedback in the ear.  I had to send them back.Update 10/6/20. Their customer service handled this better than any other company I've worked with (and I buy lots of stuff!).

I have used Bluetooth ear buds for a long time and these Tozo T6 ear buds are the best I have ever had. They fit in the ear comfortably and I have never had them fall out under any circumstance. The charging case is phenomenal and convenient.I had a small issue with the left ear bud so I reached out to Tozo and they walked me through some troubleshooting techniques and are now sending me a new ear bud to replace the old one. I cannot control plain about the product or the customer service. They are both great.,5,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
I really like the design of these earbuds because they fit my ears quite well and don’t hurt them after wearing them for a long amount of time. I appreciate that there were additional buds for people to select from in the package to find the best fit. The earbuds haven’t gone under so that’s a good sign. The sound quality is good but it could be better. Although when I wear them it does cancel out noise unless I’m listening to music or someone is shouting. Even so I am happy with this purchase because it wasn’t too pricey and it works well. A plus is that it’s waterproof.,5,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
"I got these and was so excited as they were my first pair of wireless headphones.  Having the case also be a charger is great and they came with different ear pieces so you can find the best fit for your ear.  My issue is that even brand new I constantly had the sound cutting in and out on phone calls - not while listening to music, only during phone calls.  It was so frustrating that I had to miss half the conversation when using these that I ended up only using them for listening to music which defeats the point of even buying them, if I only want a music player I'll buy a speaker.  All of this before they abruptly died on me. So now, two months later, I am again searching for a Bluetooth.  Overall, great idea but very poor product.",1,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"For what I paid, I am very happy. I wear them at work, around the house, even sitting at my computer. Very few dropouts, they pair every time with no noticeable latency.The only real annoyance is the touch feature. I would rather have physical buttons, because to adjust them or take them out, I frequently accidentally touch the outside, which pauses or skips tracks. They feature commands like long-hold one of them to increase or decrease volume, skip, or play tracks, and maybe others. I can't be bothered to memorize a bunch of shortcut commands and prefer to just pull my phone out of my pocket and either pause or adjust the volume.",5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"The earbuds feel like they fit really well in my ear and I didn't even have to change them. Sound quality for music is fabulous! I've made a phone call and it seems to be going through pretty well, but I'll probably update that later as I can make more phone calls. The charging case is pretty neat, it's in the same shape as the AirPods case. The packaging was super nice.As far as noise canceling, it's blocking out some noise but not necessarily fully noise canceling.",5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
Value for the money:Not new to these product but it’s my first time using touch earbuds. I’m always  been an apple product affection-ado but with the cost I’m starting to rethink.  These sound great! I get a full stereo image of the music! And works great in mono and I can use one while charging the other so it makes these last really long! I love sleek design.,5,1,2019-12-30,1,1,0
"Overall, these are great earbuds. Nice quality sound, compact, and a really nice carrying case/charger. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because I think the touch controls can be difficult to get them to do what you want. Also, noise cancellation is a great feature, however, I use these for meetings for work and noise cancellation can be a bit annoying because I can't really hear myself speak so I find myself talking louder than I should.",4,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
"I received my headphones and I LOVED the color. Product is actually what they describe as. The case is of good quality, and battery life is awesome. You can charge your buds right in the case and it is a pretty fast charge. The sound quality is great as well. These are right up there with the expensive brands at a fraction of the cost. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a less expensive version of earbuds.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,1,0
"I've had these earbuds for about a month now, and they have been working really well.  I generally wear them when I'm at work with only one in at a time so that I can still hear around me.  My music sounds really good on them even when I just have one in.  When I have both in and my music up, I can't hear outside noise unless it's loud.  The battery life on them is pretty good also.  I've been getting at least four hours per ear bud before I have to charge them.  I have to charge the case every 3 or 4 days to keep it going.  And I have charged the case both wired and wirelessly, both work great.  The rubber cover on the charging port is pretty good, it appears to seal well but also isn't impossible to open if you are going to charge it wired.The next test for them will be when I go for a run.  So far the fit on them has been pretty good, I generally don't have to adjust them once they're seated in my ear.  I'm excited about these for my runs, especially because of the sound quality and the battery life.  I run half marathons and more and I know that these will have no issue working through the whole race.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"I am really happy with these ear buds. They sound really clear and I have not had any issues with phone calls I have made while using them. I do experience link loss on occasion between my phone and earbuds (has only occurred a few times) with my phone being by my side. They charge rapidly and seem to function really well. The sound quality is good but they are not as loud as I would like them to be. They cancel some noise but not as much as some would think. Overall, I would recommend and feel they are a good quality for the price.",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
"Work great sound great only complaints i have is the way the buttons are set up if double tapped they will skip or rewind to the next song i use these for audio books and it is extremely difficult to remove or place these in your ear without losing your spot in a book the ability to turn up or down volume by holding your finger on the touch plate isnt favorable either since there are times when placed in the ear it will activate when you dont want it to from here on i will make sure not to buy any ""touch"" controlled earbuds an actual button works so much nicer",3,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0
"Very satisfied. I highly recommend!  After owning the previous model and loving everything about them, I decided to upgrade and give these a try and man, these are worth every penny. For the sleek and convenient design of the carrying case/charger, to the way they feel in your ears after wearing them all day. These earbuds get the job done. They work great, feel great, and I’m very satisfied with my purchase! Glad I decided to upgrade",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
"I've had these for a little over a week now and have used the most days. I often have a problem with keeping ear buds in my ear, especially when I talk/move my jaw so I was afraid I would lose them while walking around/talking etc. I've been using them while moving and packing boxes and have had no problems at all. They sound great and stay in my ear. I do have to take them out to have any kind of conversation though because I can't hear them talking. So I have found that wearing just one works well for me to be able to be aware and still enjoy my headphones. I have noticed that they occasionally drop the connection with my phone, but not enough to be too annoying. My husband asked me to test them out for him and he's decided that he will likely be purchasing the same set.",5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"I love these headphones. The battery life is quite long it will easily last the amount of time that you need them for.I use these at the gym, at work, morning walks with my dog they're great! The only complaint I would have is that the volume for these headphones are a little more on the quiet side. When I am at the gym I like to listen to music loud, in addition the 'noise cancellation' is not so much cancelling. But I will admit it does much better than most headphones I have tried. I occasionally will have issues with the headphones cutting out but they usually come back around and work fine after 30 seconds or so, could be due to battery or my ear accidentally touching the controls. For the price you cannot go wrong with these headphones, they are discreet and comfortable. They come with four different tip sizes so it is unlikely that anyone should have a hard time getting them to fit correctly. Make sure to twist the headphone into your ear canal so they sit correctly.",4,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
I found it impossible to set up so that I could hear through both earbuds at the same time.  I spent two days trying all of the tricks I read in the comments here and elsewhere before  boxing them up to return.  The documentation that came with the product was not helpful at all and I couldn't find a number on the website to talk to anyone about it. I didn't ask for a replacement out of fear that  the next set would be the same.  I'll try a different brand.Update :  Tozo contacted me after seeing original review and sent me a new pair free of charge.  They said first pair must have been defective.  Appears they're right.  No problem pairing the new set to my wife's phone and they seem to work fine.  Good sound for a reasonable price changed my evaluation from 1 to 4 stars.  BTW they sent new pair even after I said I wouldn't revise my review unless the performance merited it.  It did so I did.,4,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"Update:  Customer Service reached out to me after this review and offered to send a replacement pair in case this one is defective.  That is impressive customer service!  I'll update after I receive the replacement pair.  Added 1 star for customer service.  ORIGINAL:  The speakers are good and people can hear you ok when you talk.  The issue is that the microphone picks up EVERYTHING in the background you are in and amplifies it for the person you are talking to.  This makes it very difficult for them to hear what you are saying.  It's a shame, because I really liked these for music, etc, but for phone calls, they are useless unless you are not moving around and are in a quiet setting.",4,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"I generally thought these were great earphones, except for two design flaws. They constantly fell out of my ears (using the biggest size plastic) when walking, jumping, even chewing. It’s not hard to make a design that distributes the weight to stay in and not fall out. Then, the first flaw begets the second. Every time I tried to push them deeper into my ears, the hyper sensitive “fingerprint” touch capability stopped the music. You can literally BARELY touch these earphones without them counting it as a desired user input.Put those two flaws together, and wearing these is no fun. Picture them falling out multiple times, and every time I picked them up to shove them back in, my music paused, my phone call dropped, or the earphones shutoff altogether.",2,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"Scratched my ear and left bud fell into the sink while doing dishes.  Was under a few inches of water for maybe 10 seconds.  Dried it off.  Sound worked for a little longer, but would no longer charge or show any sign of life the next day.Would be great if I could trust them to survive a bit of water.  That was the reason to upgrade over my older pair from a different brand.",2,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0

"These are great. I did not want to spend $$$ for a wireless set so looked around, read reviews and chose the TOZO’s. What great sound and here I thought they would not be comparable to the name brand but not true. I love listening to books I have downloaded to my cell and with these earbuds I can leave my phone inside and work in the yard. They are so great I ordered another one pair for my granddaughter. Thanks for a great product!",5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"I actually really do love my ear buds. They're so convenient and was def one of my best purchases of 2019. They def noise cancel and the charge lasts so long. I typically can go a week and a half without charging., sometimes longer. I chose these over apple earbuds because of the price and since I had a black phone I wanted black buds. They don't fall out and are hard to lose even though I was terrified of losing them because I'm terribly clumsy. The only thing is that I suggest playing with the sizes of the ear bud cushions to find your best fit!",5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"I was really surprised at the sound quality! The surround sound had me guessing whether I was hearing external sound or my phone audio! The first time I tested it out on a call, my friend said it sounded muffled, but later, she said I sounded much clearer! Not sure what I did except maybe charge it longer? I love the lights on the case indicating how much charge is left on the case itself. The earbuds come in different sizes and they fit comfortably in my ears without falling out. Love it so far!",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0

"I’ve had these for a few days now and they’re honestly much better than I expected! The sound is pretty great for the price (bass can be a little low, but it really isn’t that bad at all and the sound itself is pretty crisp and clear), Bluetooth connectivity is good as I’ve been able to walk across the gym without my phone and not lose connection, and they fit well in my ears and don’t feel like they’ll fall out. Some of the touch button features can be a little hard to use, but I at least can easily pause my music using them.I’ve worn them to the gym twice now and both times they worked great and didn’t feel like they would fall out. They blocked out a good amount of noise, but of course they don’t completely block out everything. Battery seems great as I haven’t had to charge the case again since I first got it.",4,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"These are nice earbuds for a good price. I went on a lazy River with them and they are def waterproof! Sound was good and cancelled out all exterior noise. I do wish the bass was better however for the price they are pretty solid.  I like the touch aspect. You just tap your finger on the ear bud to increase/decrease volume, reverse/forward or turn on/off. Love that it comes with interchangeable ear pieces so will fit all eat sizes.",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"Without echoing what appears to be every review on this product, the Tozo T6 True Wireless Earbuds are truly spectacular for their price point. Most importantly, in my opinion, they sound flawless. I'm pretty blown away. Their battery life is nice and they are elegantly built. My only complaints if I am nitpicking would be that sometimes I accidentally pause or forward my music while re-positioning them in my ear, since they are touch sensitive, and second would be the micro-usb plug at the bottom. It is VERY hard to get out (worth it for ipx-8, but still a noticeable pain), and actually impossible for me to put it back in without cutting and removing the little cord that keeps the rubber plug dangling. Not a big deal since I use the wireless charging function (absolutely nuts for this price point), but that part could get really really annoying if you will be charging solely through the port. Still 5 stars from me, I'd buy them again in a heartbeat.",5,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"I bought these on a Saturday and they came on a Sunday. The sound quality is excellent. These have bass and aren’t tinny and trebly like so many other earbuds. I primarily use only one in an ear while at work for listening to podcasts and the battery life is as they say, between five and six hours. However, if I charge it at lunch for half an hour, it goes all day with no problem. The touch off/on is nice, as I’ve had many earbuds that go to hell on account of the on/off button breaking. My wife says the microphone sounds good when I talk to her on the phone, so no problems there. My son ordered raycons a week before I ordered these, got them five days after mine came, spent over twice as much and they don’t sound any better. They are slightly more comfortable in the ear, but these ones are just fine. I wear one ear in for almost eight hours a day and I haven’t had any problems. These are a great value.",5,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
"Easy to use, decent sound quality for what I need it for: Zoom calls, audiobooks, and noise cancellation. I like that the ear bud size is customizable, fits well, and is discreet, unlike AirPods. Easy to pair. I've had to change the equalizer on my phone for music (house, jazz, hip hop, r&b, future soul), but it's something that I can live with for the price point. The touch is sensitive, and I can't be bothered to learn all the directions right now, but being able to pause whatever I'm listening to is nice. This is my first experience with a charging case. Putting the buds in the case will automatically turn them off, and make sure to push the ear buds far enough in until the red light is on so that they charge in the case and the battery doesn't drain. I plug in the case once every 2-3 days.It's great for doing yoga when I can't have sound on because of other people working at home. I like cooking with one bud in so I can still pay attention to the stove. My partner likes that it's wireless and is considering getting one, too!",5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"These earbuds are great for running and lifting. They sync without issue, have several different size insert prices so you can find the right fit for your workout. The controls are a little clunky if you wear a mask that covers your ears while you workout get sweaty  (like a bandanna). Also, if you are still jamming out to them when you step into the shower after your workout (because they are water proof) they controls become very clunky. Clearly, these were not designed with those two situations in mind, so I don’t hold that against them.",5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
Great product. The fit is awesome. This is the first pair Of Bluetooth headphones I’ve had that actually fit my ears so they don’t fall out. I love how quickly they recharge and you don’t have to wear both to enjoy them. I only wear one at a time so I can hear other that I work with if they start talking to me. I had a problem with one of them and reached out to the company and they quickly responded with great service and an easy way to fix my problem.,5,1,2020-9-28,1,0,0
"PROS:The bass on these wireless earbuds is truly amazing. These are my first pair of tws earbuds, however I have had wireless headphones before. I love bass and was extremely impressed that a non over the head earbud could produce the bass these do. These have the best bass of any headphone inl have ever used or even listened to including premium ones.",5,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0

"These earbuds sound great to me. I sometimes get lost in my music as I listen through them. However, I have a problem with them cutting out at random times. When this happens, I sometimes have to press play from my phone as the touch controls don't always work. This is rare but still noticeable. Also others can hear my back ground noise during calls but it isn't a deal breaker for me since the same noise may be heard when I use only my phone and no earbuds. I bought it for listening to music while working and they serve that purpose well enough. I would purchase them again if I had to.",4,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"These are so comfortable.  They have lots of each size adapters so you can easily customize them.  They hold a charge a long time and the case recharges them quickly.  Touch ""tap"" controls work as they should. I can use them with my iphone for conversations and they are very clear on both ends of the conversation. Not great base. If you are wanting a  lot of base you might not be happy but other than that I would definitely recommend these.",4,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
"Perfectly fine device for your average person. Sound quality is fine. Battery lasts all day from one charge. Case also acts as a to-go charger. My only complaints are (1) the sensitivity for the play and pause is very high, and (2) they slide out pretty easily when you get sweaty.The slightest brush against the face of the devices will pause/play. This is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, being able to push my hair against the device and pause my music is nice when my hands are full. On the other hand, if I brush it while moving my hair out of the way, my music pauses. Overall, it's not enough of an annoyance to make me stop using the device, but it's something.",4,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
"With all the great reviews I was sure I’d love these ear pods. However, they have a connection issue. Mine don’t stay connected to my iPhone 11.  My media will be playing as if my phone is connected to the ear pods, but there will be no sound. To reconnect I have to place them back into the case and then remove them. Too much work... Also, battery life doesn’t seem to last. Removing them from the case is not so easy. Sound quality was not bad. Unfortunately, due to the connection issue, I’ll probably be returning them :(",2,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"The sound quality is great!  I tried each of the different sizes of the earbud attachments (except the smallest ones), and they kept falling out of my ears after just 1 or 2 minutes.  I kept having to push them back in.  After 20 days of attempting to use them (with them falling out), I finally tried the smallest earbud attachments and they now stay in the ears.  Yeah!  So now I am 100% satisfied.  I tried these on a Boeing 737 and they reduced the engine sound, but they are NOT noise cancellation.  Still, I am very happy with them.",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
I love everything about these so far. Just got them today. But it could handle a song with heavy 5 string bass without getting muddy and also some squealing high guitar notes and remain crisp. All works as advertised. Fits well. So light and free without any cords. Love how the battery case can charge them 2-3 times for all day use. If you’re on the fence about these headphones don’t be. Just get them or the T10s. You will love them. Thanks Tozo!!,5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"Pros: sound quality is decent. Definitely not very bass heavy. The noise cancelling is pretty good, as you would expect with the silicone tips. The charge lasts a long time, and the case is very easy to charge on my wireless phone charger.Cons: they fall out of my ears ALL THE TIME. I’ve tried different sizes of the silicone ends. I’ve tried putting them in my ears in different ways. They just keep falling out. I’m constantly adjusting them, and  accidentally skipping/pausing my music.",3,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
Pros: Fantastic sturdy build to these buds. They feel like they have some thought put into them. The sound quality is on par if not better than their competitors. Touch activated controls avoid the uncomfortable feeling of pushing the earbud into your ear iconic of earlier competitor models. Charging case appears to use magnets to cling to the earbuds during the charging phase. Different sized earpieces come in the box in case the default does not fit your ear. Water resistent straight out of the box with an 18 month activated warranty.Feedback: This product could be improved upon with software. Competitors include equalizer software with their buds but this one does not. The Bass is a little lacking however the competition is no better. No hear - through optional setting. These buds are also Lacking in color choice. Given the option I would have chosen a gold color.,4,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"So far this product has exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is awesome. Noise cancellation is so good that if someone talks to me while I am wearing the ear buds I can't hear anything! Fit is excellent, doesn't slip at all. The extra ""buds"" that come included help you make a perfect fit. The buds connect to each other every time and connect flawlessly to my tablet. The touch buttons avoid the necessity of pushing a button that winds up pushing the earbuds against your ear (a problem my old ear buds had).  Included instructions are straight forward. I am very glad I bought these.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"I just got these headphones yesterday. I really like them. It's my first pair of completely wireless headphones without even a neck collar. They look nice, fit well, sound good, and keep a charge for a pretty long time, not sure how long specifically but definitely more than 4 hours before needing a charge. The case is nice and clasps back together easily and very effectively and seems to charge nicely and pretty quickly. I'll get to know them more quickly because I use headphones all the time for music, podcasts, lectures, sermons, and many other things while I go through the day, work outside, and listen to stuff at home on my laptop and phone. Headphones are a very important accessory for me because I use them for hours each day and night, so I have to have good ones with good sound. I am pleased with these this far and the good sound quality and surging bass for when I want to jam to some good beats. I think that I will continue to be grateful for my purchase of these and hope to enjoy them for a long time to come. Absolutely worth the money and are a very good value for the cost better than many others, for sure.",4,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0
"So far so good.  I got these to connect to my Apple Watch but am finding them super convenient with all my devices!  To be transparent,  I have t tried them with a phone call yet so I don’t know how the other person will feel, but I’m living the noise cancellation, the comfort and automatic pairing! These are amazingly easy to set up.  I like how they fit and that they don’t actually hang down from my ear. They came fully charged and nicely packaged. Very happy with this purchase so far.",5,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
"These earbuds are the best buds, Period. The third pair I've purchased.First of all they are nice and loud. Good bass for hop hop and the clarity for rock and vocals.  The second is the ear tips are better then most I've used. They send you a variety to fit any ear. Third is the price. I have had numerous crazy expensive buds and I still go back to these. Also I have had them in my ears and dove in a pool several times and they still work. Don't even worry by these they are totally worth it👍",5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,1
"I like the earbuds a lot: convenient, small package, great sound and battery life, and 4 sizes of tips to customize your fit. I was confident one would fit, but it seems I have teeny tiny ear canals. But you know what? They have yet another size, micro, that they will ship to you upon request. How great is that?!?  Fast response, great service and price. Really liking these folks, they try hard to make things work for you.11/23/19 Updating this to say that the micro ear tips arrived, and they do indeed stay inside my tiny ear canals! I'm thrilled; having earbuds that aren't attached to a wire makes it even more problematic when they fall out. These are the first ones I've ever owned that will actually stay in my ears. I can bend over, shake my head, jump around, and move freely without fear they will fall out. Sound is great, call reception and mic are perfect. Thanks a million, TOZO!",5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"Quickest shipping ever. Excellent packaging, very secure. This is my first set of wireless earbuds. I was really happy to receive these. Very easy to pair & get started. These sound really great. I'm no expert by any means, but very nice bass, very clear sound for the price. I didn't want to pay a lot of money for a ""name brand"" & possibly lose one. This is only a couple of hours in, so I will try to remember to give an update at a later date. So far, I'm quite impressed. Thank you SELLER for a great product.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"I bought these since I had been using wired headphones that were splitting. I'm very particular on how the shape of the earbud fits into my ear. They aren't as comfortable as my old wired ones, but the sound quality is good and the battery life of the charging a case and headphones in general are great. I charged the case once when I first got it and have been using it for about a week without charging. The Bluetooth connection is also pretty good. I've been able to use it a few rooms away from my phone and still be able to listen to music. Any pairing problems are fixed by popping them back into the case and taking them back out. The touch controls to pause or change volume work well. Overall it's a pretty great product, I just can't seem to find a product that is as comfortable as my old pair. Even switching out for different sized buds only made a small difference. If you're a person who doesn't have issues with the sizing, then I'd recommend this product.",4,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0
"TLDR: I’ve tried expensive earbuds (Jaybirds and AirPods), and these are all around better (great quality and more comfortable, also waterproof, but most importantly A REASONABLE PRICE). I have been looking for the best wireless earbuds for over a year, and after all countless blogs and YouTube videos I landed on these, so I feel like that says something.Story time:",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"Right out of the box these are great, easy to pair, and power on and connect to your device as soon as you pull them out of their charging case. The sound quality is amazing, one of the best I've ever had, for all types of music, it has a good range, and the battery life is outstanding, having lasted through a 2.5 hour workout with only a slight drop in battery. As soon as they are put back in the case they start charging, and the case can go for a several days before having to be charged. The case itself charges really fast. The packaging was very nice, and comes with a 1 year registerable warranty, and different ear cup sizes, to fit all shape ears. Speaking of which, when you have the right size, they stay in really well, even through excessive movement, and the passive noise cancellation is great when you have the headphones playing, but when you pause the music you can then hear the outside world if you need to, so you don't have to take out the headphones.There are only a couple of drawbacks imo, the touch controls work well, but there is a slight delay from touch input to when the command is executed, but I might just not be used to it, and I have big fingers so sometimes I miss the center if the earbud, causing it to miss a command. Very rarely the headphones will disconnect themselves from the phone, and then you have to reconnect them, and even more rarely only one will disconnect itself, so they have to be put in the case and pulled back out to reconnect them both. The little rubber cover for the charging case charge port also sometimes doesn't want to fit back into place.",4,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I love how easy it pairs with my phone. At work I can't use both pieces, well this device allows you to use one piece without ever having to take out the second piece. Battery is phenomenal. The fit is great and it comes with multiple earbud sizes. Once I found the correct fit they do not fall off my ear! Which is great cause I love running and working out, so they stay secure in my ear. The touch buttons are sensitive but once you learn to use them it'll be easy and it's much better than having to push buttons against your ears. Phone conversations are great. My friends say they can hear me clear, however, this was in an enclosed location, not outside, I'm yet to try talking in busy areas like the mall. The device is super low weight. Overall, a great buy and you cannot beat the price! Will buy again for family and friends.",5,1,2019-10-18,1,0,1
"Blew me away right out the box. Sounds great. Came fully charged, no frills.Only time will tell if there are any imperfections. But overall highly recommended compared to those high priced products like apple and beats. Thanks for all the other reviews which led me to purchasing this product.",5,1,2020-4-20,1,1,0
"These headphones seem great at first. They come with several options for ear pieces, to make sure you get the right fit, they're compact, they charge well, everything seems great. Until you try to use them. I like to have headphones in the morning, so I can listen to my podcasts while walking around, getting ready for the day. But if I shower and my hair is still wet, every time it touches the earbud, the program stops. Or skips ahead. Or rewinds. When my hair is dry, this isn't an issue (though pulling a shirt over your head can also trigger it). This makes these earbuds absolutely impossible to use in the morning. Surprisingly, I also found them rather difficult to trigger when I meant to. When someone walked into the room to talk to me, I had to go find my phone to pause the program, because tapping on the earbud to pause suddenly wouldn't work. Somehow these headphones are too sensitive when you don't want them to be, and nowhere near sensitive enough when they should be. All in all, incredibly frustrating to use, and I'll be returning them.",3,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"So far so good! They fit snugly in my ears and would only fall out if I were aggressively shaking my head for like 20 seconds.The highs are nice and crisp without being tinny, though like other reviewers have noted, I could use just a hair more bass. Getting them all the way into your ear has a big impact on the perceived bass level, but I’m definitely not disappointed. One reviewer mentioned low max volume level, but as a DJ, he likely has some hearing damage. I’m sure my ears aren’t 100% either having produced music for years, but they are plenty loud for me. They are definitely on par with standard iPhone earbuds.",4,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
I was very excited to try these and loved the color. I used these with 2 different phones and tried to talk to multiple people using these.  EVERYONE had the same complaint.  They couldn't hear me or stated I sounded like I was under water. Unfortunately I will be returning these. I can't rate anything else because I didn't get to wear them for more than 2 mins.,1,1,2020-1-6,1,1,0
"I ordered the white T6, which unlike some of the reviews mine  did come with different sized tips. Very satisfied with sound quality and volume, although I cut the treble a bit with an equalizer which gave a fuller sound. Range is at least 10 ft and no dropouts yet. I can also get them in and out of the case without much of a problem, they stay put in my ear, and they unpair and don't try to pair again when put in the case (or turned off when not active). Sometimes when I try to tap once to pause or play, or tap and hold to change the volume, it sometimes interprets it as skip forward or backward. There were two instruction booklets enclosed, and they gave different directions for resetting (two versus three rapid taps in pairing mode), but haven't needed to reset yet. Don't know about battery life nor durability yet, but the earbuds feel solid. I have to say that coming from fairly high end headphones the sound is suprisingly good.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"These are my first true wireless earbuds but I am an audio engineer and I have purchased high-end speakers and headphone to suit my tastes.  These little guys produce some great sound for the price point.  I was very surprised when I first put them in.  Deep rich bass (as long as you have a tight fit) and nice clear highs.  I am not sure why anyone would spend the money on AirPods when you can get this kind of sound from these.  I also like the small compact charging case and the quality of build.  Nice job, TOZO!",5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"This is my 3rd set of Bluetooth earbuds and one of the best in terms of sound (bass) quality.  The 'control' buttons on both sides of the buds are a little more complex to get used to/use compared to other earbuds (I generally like the TOZO T10s a little better).  I have bulky fingers and have had a bear of a time trying to get the earbuds out of the very compact case.  Case is great, but the earbuds are so smooth I can't get a grip on them to remove.  Not sure I'd recommend these over the T10s.  The 'waterproof' aspect is not that important to me.",4,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"So i read all the specs about the TOZO T6 and am convinced that with an IPX8 rating and even instructions in the manuel about using them when swimming, I take the plunge and buy them.  What a mistake!!  First time I swim with them it becomes immediately apparent that the touch controls on the ear buds are activated by the water - no I am not joking!!  It was a complete farce, the music I wanted to listen to was skipped forward and back, the volume was turned up and down, even Siri made an appearance and then the music would stop and start again and then with the next tiny splash of water, I am not an olympic swimmer, off we go again.  I have looked everywhere for instructions on how to turn off the touch controls but to no avail. Apparently you can't. SO the long and short of it is this,  these earbuds are sold as waterproof and they seem to be, although the left one is now quieter than the right one after going swimming. But and this is a big but, you can't use them for swimming because the water activates the touch controls on the ear buds rendering them completely useless in the water. What an absolute waste of my money!! I have to say, absolute trash!!",1,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"For $40 bucks, these earbuds are GREAT. When first getting them, the packaging gives off a premium feel. It comes with ear buds, case, multiple ear tips, USB 3.0 cord and papers.When taking them out, they paired in under 7 secs and the connection is flawless so far. The earbuds are fairly small and light. They go into your ear and stay there, no problems with moving around. Wearing them for long lengths of time can become a tad uncomfortable.  Distance seems to not be much an issue but I haven't pushed it far enough yet.",4,1,2020-1-25,1,0,1
"This is my second pair, as I sadly lost my first. The sound is wonderful. They have adjustable earbuds so you can find your right comfortable size. The inside of the carrying case is magnetized so they can't fall out.  The only draw back is it comes WITHOUT a charger. They give you the USB cable for the charger but you have to order it separately. Fortunately, the charger's price won't break the bank.  I love these headphones.",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,1
"Disclaimer: TOZO reached out to give me a refund on these earbuds in exchange of an honest review to help them improve their products. So here is my unbiased 100% honest review.I have been an Apple AirPods user since they first came out, so a lot of my opinions would be comparing these earbuds with the AirPods. Please note that the AirPods are about 3 times the price of these, so direct comparisons are probably unfair. In short, everything is pretty great about these earbuds except the sound quality, which I can't really complain for a pair of $60 earbuds.",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,1

"I got these and connected them to my phone. That went flawlessly. I vacuumed, and mowed the lawn. The seal is good enough on these to create passive noise reduction.

They work far better than the standard ear buds that come with phones, the mic carried well in a conversation. I still need to test that in a noisy environment.",5,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
"Perfect ! Just what I was looking for much decent price . After reading so many reviews I don’t regret at all after buying this I saw my sister and ordered mine the next day and showed it to my coworker and she ordered the same day after my reviews . Can’t go wrong . Easy to use , easy one touch Bluetooth connect for first time then it automatically connects as long as your Bluetooth is on.

I thought my previous headphones were “great”, but after trying these, I would never go back!",5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
Have just had it for a week but was instantly impressed with how much better the sound quality is compared to my iPods. More convenient too since I can adjust the volume without the phone. Only complaint so far is that they immediately turn music on upon removing from the case even when you don’t have a music app open. Also if you take them out they continue to play music unless you put them in the case or turn them off.,5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"I was very much looking forward to these ear buds after being frustrated by another company, but my frustration continues. For some reason the left ear bud will not sit probably in the charging station and wont charge consistently.  Even worse, because its not seated it thinks i'm trying to use it, so it trumps my calls or blue tooth in my car and tries to play. Very disappointed. When they do work, the sound quality was average",1,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"They connect quick, you can use one or both with no issues. Very durable and they will charge quickly with any platform charger.Call quality is superb from either one or both the buds.",4,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"For the price these are amazing! Perfect little headphones. They are in and out of my ears all day and don’t have to charge. I frequently shoot baskets as part of my workout and they do not fall out even with the jumping and whatnot. I also love that people can barely tell I’m using them. Sound quality is very good, everything is very clear never had any issues. I haven’t figured out the touch buttons, sometimes they can be annoying if it resets my track/podcast but that my fault for not learning them. Noise cancellation works well with them on. Not so much on flights, I could still hear the background noise, I’ll keep my Bose for that, but most other situations I prefer these. Just ease of use. My only gripe is they don’t get as loud as I would like but it’s probably for the best for my hearing. All in all highly recommend",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
First off I'd like to say alot of the bad reviews are actually valid but here's my opinion on my top reason for keeping them and top reason why im gonna send them back. Headphones are ok for music. Not in any way the best sound but I would actually keep them if music was all I wanted them for. The reason im gonna send them back is because thre connection is very choppy when on a call no matter how close I am to my phone. The nail in the coffin was when I took them to work with me the noise cancellation was almost non existent. Decent earbuds overall but just wasn't coming thru on the main things I needed them to do.,3,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
I love the case. The airpods style suits me. Sound quality is great. Connection is automatic and immediate and strong. Battery life seems endless at least for my purposes. Phone calls are clear. They are also much cheaper then airpods and sound a lot better.,5,1,2020-8-25,1,1,0
"Nearly impossible to follow poorly written instructions. I guess being 64 years old makes me too slow to figure these things out. Back to wired earbuds. I had a previous pair of wireless buds with a wire. I lost them. They were a breeze to set up and use. If you have a degree in mechanical  engineering or computer science,  you just might be able to use these. As for me, they're on their way back where they came from.",1,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"The overall experience is decent, it’s the battery operation of these earbuds that just sucks. I’ve tried removing them and putting them in the case and I’ve tried turning them off before putting them in the case in both instance the right side earpiece battery just drains overnight. I have left them on a charger for over 4 hours and the case indicator lights will say fully charged but after 2 hours of continuous use and powering off the earbud and returning it to the case the next morning the right earbud will be completely dead. I have pulled them from the case after an overnight charge and connected to my iPhone only for the battery to read 60% charged. I’m disappointed in them for this poor battery life issue because I do like the look and feel of these earbuds. It’s just very annoying to pull them out to use only to find the battery on one or both sides dead.",2,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
So far they work great. I have used them for four hours at work and they have not cut out once.  I work as a metal fabricator welder and have welded with my head inside of metal boxes and these headphones still keep their connection perfectly. Very happy with the purchase! Some people have complained that these are slippery and hard to get out of their charging box.  I have rather large fingers and do not find this to be a problem.,5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"So I have a data-limited phone.  But I can download hours of music on my phone and listen to it data-free while I walk my dog.  The T6 earbuds rock as far as I'm concerned (although I've haven't tried any other brands)!  I wear only one walking so I can still hear traffic noise, but wear both around the house.I first tried the T10s (version before the T6s) but I had some connectivity issues with my phone.  The T6 easily connects every time. The touch controls take a little time to get used to, but my downloaded music allows you to skip songs, e.g., like the ones you don't like.  So I don't even have to grab my phone out of my pocket to do it, I just double-tap on either earbud and it works--my downloaded music is not set up to go back, so in my case, the left earbud works like the right--double-tap skips a song .  Not sure now if the T10s had this capability, but it is a cool feature on the T6s.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"I was skeptical to buy these pods. But looking at reviews, I decided to take a leap. But I am pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and performance. Sound quality is excellent. I like little more bass and clear sound. I think this sound quality is comparable with expensive ear pods ($200+ price range). Build quality, bluetooth range, battery life are great. These are comfortable to ear. After sometimes you forget that you are wearing something.Overall if you are thinking to buy apple or other ear pods, give try to this one.",5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0

They fit well in all their ears because they come with 6 different sized things to go in your ear. Sound is good. Touch controls work well. They’ve never fallen out of their ears, even the 9 yr old who’s always running around and dancing with them in! Haven’t tested the waterproof part.",5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"I'm giving these a 4 out of 5 because I don't think they are perfect.  But... they are pretty good.  I'm not an audiophile but I think the sound quality is quite decent.  The bass response is more pronounced if you use a larger tip and jam them deep into your ears.  I prefer a little less bass so a smaller one that allows for some sound to escape works better for me and it also provides a little less isolation from the rest of the world.  I also found more isolation made it more difficult to use these for phone calls because I didn't get the feedback from my own voice and it was difficult to tell how loud I was speaking .  I found that pairing these with my phone to be pretty easy.  The negatives aren't too bad.  It is a little difficult to get the buds out of the case, not too bad but perhaps it could be made a little easier with a design change.  I think the ability to touch these and change functions is a great idea but in practice I found myself muting the headphones way too often when I was just trying to adjust them.  A minor nit is that the ""electronic voice"" describing the current function sounds like she has a speech impediment but that's easily ignored.",4,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"Honestly, if I could give this a 4.5, I would. Now, that doesn't mean these headphones are horrible because they aren't, they are great. The only reason why I would dock half a star is because the headphones will randomly disconnect from your phone or laptop then reconnect again. This doesn't happen often but it does happen which is inconvenient.I'd say that the best feature to these headphones are the fact that you can use one by itself and they are not reliant on one anothee like some other Bluetooth headphones. So if that's what you are looking for in a pair of Bluetooth headphones, I'd definitely recommend getting these.",5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0

"My original review is below, in which I game them 4*. After spending some time with them under all conditions, I've had a big change of mind.  They are now 2*'s. 1) The tapping functionality is very poor and inconsistent. You have to be VERY precise to get them to respond accurately.  When you are running, biking or heck, even just walking it rarely works. Sometimes even the wind during a ride will change a setting. 2) The range is spotty at best. For example, if I have my phone in a pouch on my back when I'm cycling it drops signal. If I move the phone to the front side, it picks it back up. I've found the same thing when I'm working in the yard or any other instance when the phone is not right in front of me. 3)  You might as well forget about using them in water. This is one of the main reasons I bought them and they simply don't work. They are waterproof to the extent they are not ruined if you take them in water, but if you get any water on them you lose signal. They didn't even work in the shower.  4) On the upside, the audio quality when working is of high quality and they do block out a lot of noise.Bottom-line, you get what you pay for and these are cheap for a reason. Oh well, live and learn.  Old review below:",2,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"I really like this pair of headphones for the following reasons:- Long battery life. I mostly use this for listen to audiobooks or music while I'm working, running errands, doing chores, etc. The battery life works perfectly for that.",5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"These earbuds are amazing! I have owned air pods and two other types of earbuds in the same price range as these and these are by far the best! They are the best earbuds for functionality that I have ever used (I have an iPhone). They always connect right away and switching between left, right, and or both earbuds is virtually seamless. Unlike air pods what I really like about these buds is that they are IPX8 waterproof. I have used them in the shower many times. I have roommates so I can’t play loud music or podcasts in the bathroom but these allow me to do just that. The only thing that I would note is that you do have to be careful to avoid water hitting the touch controls of the bud in a certain way because it does sometimes change the song or pause/play what you are listening to. However, I’m not sure how that could be fixed and I wouldn’t want these to be changed to a physical push button. I have  pair that have a physical push button and, unlike these, they are painful to use or you have to take them out of your ears. Battery life is great! Get these!",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,1
"The case design is aesthetically pleasing to hold and look at with its slim with smooth curved sides. they practically disappear in  my pocket  The simple elegant design is topped off with the fact that the case charges  wirelessly. The sound is excellent with deep powerful base, smooth mid range and crystal clear highs. the Touch controls include all the functions you need including volume, something I frequently use and it’s great not to have to search in my pocket for the phone and then take it out and adjust the volume, you can do it all with the controls right on the earbuds. I listen to a wide range of music and the T6 has handled everything from rock to classical.  I lost my first T6 and I bought another pair because I couldn’t see anything out there that had all the functions and controls that the T6 has and looked as great.

And on top of all of that, it's IPX68 waterproof! Did I forget to mention that it supports wireless charging!? All of this for under $50 is an absolute steal!The sound quality of these T6's are amazing. If you love bass, then you will love these earbuds. These buds get plenty loud and I can feel the thumping and vibration of the bass. The vocals are very clear and the bass does not drown out the mids or highs at all. I listen to all genres of music and these earbuds passed every song test that I put it up against.

Other than that flaw they are great earbuds.",2,1,2020-6-12,1,2,0
"Pretty neat earbuds! The sound is nice and they fit pretty well in my small ears. I did change out the rubber bits to make them fit a little better though. Plus there are plenty of sizes for you to find a good fit. The set up was easy took me less than 2 minutes to figure it out. Then the instructions were clear on how to change the music/volume, and how to answer calls. There is also a feature where you can pull up Siri by pressing 3 times( not in the instructions, I just figured that out on my own). I see a lot of reviews complaining about them breaking after a few weeks, and then they can return them. But, there’s an extended warranty offer that comes with the buds so seems like people aren’t smart consumers. As long as you didn’t do anything wrong with them they will send you new ones. Overall it’s a good buy with a good value.Edit: they are definitely not water proof. Like water doesn’t damage them but the certainly don’t function. They read the water as a touch and one turned its self off as soon as it got wet. Still a good buy but a little false advertising.",5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,1
***Update: After using them for a few weeks I have to add to the cons and drop a few stars. Frist off the shape is strange and looks like it's falling out of your ear.  In fact after having them in jumping around they fall out pretty easy.  I would love to love them but just odd all aroundI received these today after trying out a few other brands in the past month. Out of 6 I've tried these have the best sound.  Good easily understandable instructions were sent with quite a few different size rubber pieces for different ear sizes.,2,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0

It sorta does get a bit hot, but not enough to be alarmed about, IMO.Both the earbuds and charging case had a lot of juice straight out of the box. Once paired to a device, they connect really quickly out of the case! I am also super glad these came with many ear tip options. I swapped out the default tips to the smallest ones and they fit great! They don't fall out, even when I do a head shake test. Super glad I got these!",5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"Audio quality sounds great. The touch sensitive controls are lacking though. Regarding that feature, the only thing they do consistently is start and stop music/videos when I don’t want them to: typically when I’m just trying to adjust the positioning in my ear. They also don’t pair consistently forcing me to tell my iPhone to ignore the device and re-establish the Bluetooth search to pair them again. It comes in a small recharging container which is great and on the whole I do like them. That said, I would probably buy the version with mechanical buttons next time.",3,1,2020-2-26,1,1,0

My only issue with these is that I've tried all the ear pieces but these won't stay in my ears unless I'm sitting still.  I had one fall into my waffle this morning while I was eating! 🤦🏾‍♀️ Guess I wasn't still enough! 😜 I use them when teaching virtual yoga classes and I frequently have to chase an earbud around as it rolls around after falling out of my ear.  Problem with that is they are VERY sensitive to touch so I have changed the song and even disconnected the call trying to put them back in.  So for me these are not for use when being active unless I wear a headband or something to keep them in place.  Again the sound quality including mic is great!  Other than not staying put they are great!",4,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"I have two words to say.. BUY THEM.You will not be disappointed. I searched for a good week for a good set of wireless ear buds and I am certainly glad I came upon these. I mainly focused on AirPod style clones and none of them had everything I was looking for, but these did. I spent atleast a good 8 hours over the week looking at reviews of different ear buds and even looking at YouTube Reviews. I narrowed it down to the Anker Soundcore Neos, they had the size I wanted, battery life, sound quality(from reviews), and seemed to be a pretty snug fit, good pricing, but they didn’t have wireless charging which was definitely a bummer and I glad I didn’t go with them. I saw these in the related products and at first kind of laughed thinking these would be a joke but boy was I wrong. Every review I read said NOTHING but good things about them, they’re very similar to the Soundcores in a lot of ways but these have wireless charging which sold me. I even had a coupon for $20 off which easily made my decision. I paid like $51 after shipping, which I purchased Friday and received today!!",5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,1
These are great earbuds if you just need them for music or watching videos.They need to work on the noise cancelling and call quality. If you are on a call the mic picks up everything in the background including wind and rain noise.,3,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0

"I really did like the small size and the fact that the buds could charge wirelessly. However, the sounds was not very great. It was very tinny with very little bass and did not block out the ambient noise around me. The buds did pair well every time. However, I would have to agree with some of the reviews that the touch controls were too sensitive. I am not sure if I received a pair of buds that were not working to their fullest, but the sound quality was just not great, nor was it loud enough. These will have to go back.",2,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0
"These little guys are great! The battery life on These are astonishing. The sound quality is amazing. The volume is right where they need to be. The bass is deep and on point. Nevermind the nitpickers, these are earbuds should be more than what they are in my opinion.A must: figure out the size of earbuds that fit your ear and the rest is history. These earbuds fit snub into your ears and will not fall out if inserted properly. I've taken a shower with them without wetting my entire head and they work!",5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
"Just received them today and the require a review to lengthen the warranty. So this could change in the future but after 5 minutes I've found they sound pretty good. Better than I expected. No noise around me yet so unsure about noise canceling. Using Alexa is easy and worked perfectly. Several ear tip sizes so should be comfortable. Only thing I've noticed is charging wirelessly (QI) for only about 5 minutes the case got really, really hot.",5,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
"I purchased the TOZO T6 IPX8 earbuds to use when I ride my bike. Unfortunately, the earbuds I purchased were not holding a charge. I followed all troubleshooting steps, but to no avail. I contacted TOZO Customer Support [Elena] to see if there was anything else I could try to resolve the issue. I had two correspondence with Elena. The first was to report the issue and she instructed me to try additional troubleshooting steps but to no avail. The second correspondence I had, Elena communicated to me that she will be sending me a new pair of TOZO T6 IPX8 earbuds free of charge AND I didn't have to return the defective ones. I was WOW'ed!! The service I received from Elena, I certainly did not expect!!! Elena was so focused on getting me satisfied which I greatly appreciated. Within days of our correspondence, I received a new pair of earbuds and they are charging fine AND they sound GREAT!!!! This was a wonderful customer service experience that I wish other companies can learn from. I will be looking to purchase other TOZO products because of the service I received from Elena - well done and Thanx so much!!",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
I rarely write reviews but these headphones have completely replaced the wired headphones for me. With the added bonus that I have and apple phone which meant that I would need the white apple connecter to be able to connect headphones to my phone these headphones are a great adaption for not having to keep replacing them. They are great for listening to music among other things without have the annoying cord and when I listen to my podcasts or music to bed where I can move freely since they are wireless. They do have excellent battery life as well. I sit behind a desk at work and instead of having a cord and being close to my phone I can have these headphones in and not be hassled to stay so close to my phone and not turn around so much so I put these in and move around as much as I need around the office and get all my work done. These headphones help to make sure I am efficient and hardworking without the hassle. They do stick out of my ear a little bit but that may also be because I'm not putting them in correctly that they don't stick out at all. Other then that I am happy with this purchase,5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"Pros: Good sound quality, lots of fit options with the included earbud attachments, quick charging, and pairs easily with my iPhone. Never had a problem with call quality, people hearing me, or bluetooth losing connection.Cons: Controls can be finicky; touching to go to the next track often pauses playback first, then skips to the next track on subsequent touches. I also found that jogging with these types of earbuds was a little challenging in terms of keeping them in my ear. You need to get the right fit earbud covers to make them stay in place.",4,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0
"If you are smart and reading the reviews to research the best product to buy, I am here to help. I bought these earbuds to use at work. I have tried other products like this that haven't had very good signal at all. If I so much as turn away from my phone it would lose connection, but these work wonders! I can walk across the room with no problem. Two or three room across the house, and signal gets shoty. But they work well for me. It even comes with a free one year warranty! The case charges quickly and keeps the buds protected, but they ARE NOT LIKE AIRPODS! An airpod skin won't fit on these. Leave your pod products at home. Android is better anyway.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"Wow! These buds are awesome.  The sound quality is amazing.  I love the fact that they actually stay in my tiny ears while I'm working out and getting sweaty and I can easily control tracks but just tapping the bud on my ear.  One tap pauses or plays,  two quick taps skips to next track etc.  The manual has all the codes in it.  They are very sleek and discreet.  It doesn't look like ear droppings like those air pods do,  lol! I love these little guys!",5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
"Like these a lot! Had some similar in a different brand that I was a fan of but they stopped working. Was very impressed with these and the sound quality and the base on these tiny things. They start to hurt my ears when I wear them too long but I think it’s just my ears and how I had them positioned. Over all such a great product, especially for the price. I’d take these over air pods for sure, because personally I don’t like the look of AirPods and they’re too expensive and not secure enough for me. These stay in your ears great, they’re really good for working out and running",4,1,2020-6-13,1,1,0
"I received these today because I didn't want to spend $100+ on another name brand set of wireless earbuds.  These had plenty of good reviews that did not appear to be a scam in nature.  At max volume, it's a bit below what I prefer when I really need to pump the beats at the gym - but you get what you pay for.  These aren't the more expensive name-brand wireless earbuds where you might get better sounding music, but these honestly are great for what they are - affordable, and not junk.",4,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"I'm probably a basic user by today's standards; I don't mess with earbud touch controls, taking calls, etc. I use earbuds for listening to music and watching videos. That's what I can fairly review the TOZO T6 earbuds for, and for that they're great. I also have the T10 earbuds in white. The charging case for the T6 is a preferable size and design, which reminds me of a Zippo lighter.The battery life is great, the case is adorable and functional, and the sound is solid. At this price point, the T6 can't be beat.",5,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0
"I've wanted to buy a pair of wireless ear buds for a long time; however, I didn't want to pay a huge amount for them. I happened upon these one day, read the reviews, and here we are. I've been using them for  few days now with audio books and music and I can truly say I love them. I have small ear canals and I love all the different size ear pieces they offer which provides a custom fit. Try them! You will not regret it!",5,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"I love these earbuds! These sound awesome, with nice full bass and crisp highs. Battery life is very good and I love how you can charge the case wirelessly. I would hesitate to say these are rose gold though. It's more of a pearl pink (I put them next to a rose gold ring and a pink pearl bracelet to show the color difference) Regardless, I love the the color of these earbuds and I would definitely recommend them.",5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,1
The air buds are my first and work very well. I like that you are given four pairs of ear plugs so you can properly fit them to your ears. The case is very nice! The only thing I have trouble with is setting the volume correctly. I need to learn how to do that properly otherwise I love them!,5,1,2020-4-1,1,1,0
I just received them but they connected quickly out of the box to my iPhone XS. Sound is good but call quality is expectedly so-so with the mic so far from voice. Sounds like in a tunnel. But no static or cut out. Haven't had long enough to know about battery life but setup and sound were top notch. I like to listen to music but not enough  to overspend on headphones. These are inexpensive enough I could lose and not be devastated.,5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"I can't believe it. I apparently have very small ears and I have always had trouble finding the right ear bud size, which is why I have always stayed away from things like this. I read some great reviews on this and I just had to at least try. These are amazing! The sound quality is amazing, they are truly wireless, and are waterproof! You just can't swim with them underwater. I haven't had these very long, but with a great warranty that Tozo offers and the $6 3 year warranty from Amazon, I am so happy that I will basically never have to worry about this again! And they are *so* *cheap* for the quality that you get! They are so easy to use and the noise cancellation is awesome! The material quality is great too. If you are looking for an amazing pair of headphones for a reasonable price, get these!",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"I love these headphones. I had the prior version, and these are much better - they never cut out like the previous ones. I like the touch controls, too. Sounds is great, and the noise cancelling feature is pretty good (not great).But, I've only had these for a few months and they stopped holding a significant charge. I have to charge them almost every night, and it takes a full 7-8 hours to charge them fully. A bit of a disappointment because I need them daily, for most of the day.",4,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"I have used these earbuds at work, running and riding my bike.  They fit my ears great and have had one only fall out once while riding my road bike but I believe that was more do to me not inserting them in correctly because after that incident I have had no issues with them.  To me the sound quality is great for the price.  I like that you can just use one especially when I rode ride I am not totally isolated from the road noise.  The battery life has been great so far. I can also use the earbud's touch controls with my mountain bike gloves on which is usually hit or miss with touch controls with mountain bike gloves.  I did not buy these to take calls on so I have not tried that yet.  So far been really impressed with all the features these earbuds have.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,1,0
"I ordered one pair of these just to try them out. My Apple pods were dying a slow death and I was looking to replace them. The price point was so good that I was unsure of the quality but I didn't feel like there was much to lose.In my opinion, these earpods are way better than the Apple ones! The sound quality is very good and they stay charged much longer than my Apple ones ever did.",5,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"Overall, I'd say this is a really good set of earphones. The design is very compact and it's thin enough so that it doesn't feel too bulky in your pockets. The sound quality is very good and the battery life hasn't given me many problems considering every time you place them in the box they charge very quickly so they are almost always on maximum battery.There are a few minor downsides though. First off, the earphones are hard to take out from the box sometimes (the magnets are relatively strong, and the glossy end of the phones is slippery, so they are a bit hard to grip). Also, while the on earphones controls do work, they'd work better by being more sensible (you often times try to skip a song by double tapping but the earphones only pause which requires 1 tap). Also I had a problem with the earphones case because when I placed them inside and closed the case they failed to turn off (meaning that they stayed on playing music in the case and connected to my phones without me even knowing). However, the customer service email solved my problem.",4,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"My third bluetooth earbud product, as well as two sets purchased for my kids. Got the T6  because the sound was so good on my son's T10s, and I liked the smaller earbud profile. (Doesn't stick out from the ear as much).Very very pleased with the purchase. Louder and with better bass than my current buds. Compact case holds charge forever.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"Just got these wireless earbuds today! Sound/ noise cancellation is awesome, and the Bluetooth distance is great! In contrast to other reviews, I have not had trouble taking the earbuds out of the case (but my fingers are small) and the sensitivity of the earbuds are not influenced by my hair getting in the way (I have heard in previous reviews that when customer's long hair brushes against the earbuds, the music pauses but I haven't had that problem). It was very easy to pair and the instructions were very clear. I have not tried the water durability and battery usage yet, but it seems to be holding up well. The only thing I would criticize is that it is hard to fit different sizes of the earbud onto the wireless earbuds (perhaps I'm not strong enough?). Overall, I did a lot of research before purchasing these earbuds (even compared them to the T10), and so far, it has been working very well! Perhaps I will update in a few weeks as a follow-up. Hope this review helps! :)",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
Just ordered these yesterday and came in today. First impression is very high. There are plenty of rubber ear bud options to fit your ears. The sound is amazing with good Bass. They came already charged and ready to go. Haven't tested the wireless charging yet but looking forward to that next....assume that works great or I will update the review. Time will tell on these but I will update this review if anything changes. Overall great product so far!,5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,1
"I was hesitant about buying earbuds that were under $100.00, but I read the reviews and took a chance.  They are just as good as everyone said.  I was also afraid that they wouldn't fit my ears because I have really small ear canals, but the smallest attachments fit perfectly.  The sound is great as is the noise canceling.  I didn't rate the battery life because I don't think I've had them long enough to really test that.  Overall, I'm very happy with them!",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
"Great little earbuds! They fit well and sound awesome. They connect easily to each other and to my phone or the Bluetooth transmitter I have plugged into my TV.

"This is my first pair of earbuds. I resisted the Apple EarPods because the earpieces on the wired headphones never stayed in my ears until I bought silicon adapters. These are great. I’m still working in which size of cushion will work best.  I wish it wasn’t all black. Some color contest and information markers would help. Instruction print is tiny, but YouTube helps. I load playlists on my phone so I can play what I want to hear, so can’t say anything about Spotify.",5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"UPDATED: I have been using these earbuds for a few months. I had one of the earbuds die out unexpectedly, so I reluctantly contacted their customer service to see about getting a replacement. I usually have no faith in getting great service, but I was blown away with how responsive TOZO was about helping me. They helped through some troubleshooting to confirm there was an issue and they volunteered to send replacements. They were VERY friendly and communicative. Just another reason to feel good about purchasing theseI bought these on a whim and I'm really glad I did. The sound quality is great, the range is good. Battery life is decent, but they charge fast and they can also charge wirelessly which is super convenient. The only thing I would say is the touch controls are a bit tricky at first, but you will get used to them as you use them more and more.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"Bought these for my husband to replace his Samsung IconX buds thathe loved.  He is very particular about electronics.  After reading a ton of reviews and comparisons, i pulled the trigger.  I am so glad I did.  With Prime they arrivedthe next day.  He couldn't believe how well they cancelled noise and the overall sound quality.  He is a music lover and said the sound, especially the base was fantastic.  He usually wears the Studio Beats, but these are for work.  He loves them.  Can't believe the quality for the value...and they are waterproof!! I will be buying these as gifts for my 20 something yo nephews as gifts",5,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
"I just got these two days ago, so I'm still getting used to them. The sound is fantastic and if you're trying to shut out outside sounds they seem to do that very well too. I'm still getting used to the controls. This is my first pair of wireless earbuds. I'll caution you to make sure you use the correct ear caps so they stay in your ears. One of mine slipped out the first day while I was picking up dog poop. Good thing they're waterproof! Cleaned it off in the sink.",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"I was excited to try out these buds, but I didn't even take the time to check the sound quality and various features because they were so difficult to remove from the charging case! My fingers are not huge. The problem is the buds sit very low in the case and the cover of the case does not flip all the way back, which makes it very difficult to get a grip on the buds. Not only would it be very frustrating trying to get them out every day, but it would also increase the chances of my dropping them.",2,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"I get they wanted to make them different with the touch screen and similar to higher end blue tooth headphones. However, it is an incredibly annoying design. Every time I barely touch something to the ear piece it will pause my music or turn the volume down. This is especially annoying working out. I also can’t shower with them in which is the main reason I owned the previous Tozo model. The hot water messes with the touch sensitive face of the ear pieces and starts turning the volume up/down or pausing the music. I will return these and rebuy the previous model without the touch sensitivity",2,1,2020-3-27,1,1,0
"These headphones worked pretty well for a while, but about six months after purchasing them, the left headphone suddenly stopped producing pretty much any sound. It still connects and produces some sound, but it's so quiet that you can only hear it with the volume blasting in a quiet room, but it's still only about 1% of the volume of the right headphone. I tried following the included instructions on how to do a factory reset, but that doesn't actually do anything. Additionally, there's no option to turn off the touch control, which would have been a nice feature. I hate how whenever I touch my headphone for any reason, the music pauses. Some people might find that useful, but I really wish I could just turn it off entirely. If that were the only issue, I'd give these four stars, but the fact that they just crap out in a half a year is enough for me to not recommend these at all.",2,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"I’ve not gotten wireless earbuds before because they’re all just so expensive, but I recently rejoined the gym, and I thought it might be nice to get some. Of course, I took to Amazon. I got these and the T10, which are also fine, but I do like the ability to control these by touching the earbuds, so I’m going to stick with these.As some others have mentioned, YES, the touch is sensitive, so you may end up skipping forward or back a song or something if messing with them... I just don’t care. That doesn’t bother me.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
My son bought airports pro and I bought the tozo t6.  At first i was dissapointed listening to youtube through Bluetooth on laptop.  I was getting a lot of crackling.  I thought the headset was bad then I hooked up through my phone and listened to music.  Day and night.  Was so clear great base and highs.  I think they sounded fuller than the airpods pro and for the price!  No brainer.  Great sounding can't wait to keep using.  The packaging was also great with 6 different tips for ears.,5,1,2020-3-17,1,0,1
"Overall I'm pretty happy with them. They came nicely packaged. I just got them so I can't speak to the battery life. However, there are a lot of different ear bud sizes which is why I chose this brand. I took off the medium size that came with them and put on the smaller size. I jumped up and down did my imitation of a metalhead head bang and they didn't budge. I'm pretty happy with the fit. Plus the rose gold is really pretty!!!",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,1
"I purchased a similar model of this product for my dad a while back and he seemed to like them so I decided to get some for myself as well. For the first few months, the worked fine without any issues and then suddenly I put them in for a run one day and the right earbud was WAY lower in sound than the left. I tried putting them back in the case and out again, I tried turning them off and on, disconnecting from bluetooth, googling solutions, everything! Nothing worked and it is very weird to have to listen to a full volume song in one ear and then a whispered song in the other ear. The sad thing is that I haven't even had a decent amount of time to enjoy them. I've only used them a handful of times within these few months of having them. Maybe it's just a fluke thing that happened to me, but I'll probably look at a more popular brand if I ever get another wireless set of earbuds again.Update: It appears that TOZO has reached out and offered to either provide new earbuds or a refund for the issues that occurred. I do appreciate the fact that they have reached out and seem to want to resolve the issue. More details to come.",3,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0
"Sound quality is amazing! You won’t be disappointed.  After reading multiple reviews, I decided to try these and I am really impressed with the sound quality and comfort.  I tried the different ear piece sizes that come with it to find a comfortable fit. But once you find that fit and follow the directions on how to wear them, I think you will be pleased.  I had already sent back 3 other wireless earphones in which the sound quality was just “okay” by different makers.  I use these primarily for working out and haven’t had any issues with them falling out. I can walk around the house without loosing connection to my iPhone. I was also impressed with the packaging in comparison to other earphones I returned.  It seems the company believes in their product and didn’t cut corners. If you have an iPhone... the packaging of these earphones is similar. Just a nice touch for the price! I selected the rose gold which is a soft pink color. Love them! I don’t write many reviews but I have to say, these were worth the time to review.",5,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
"I opened the box and immediately was impressed everything was shrink wrapped, I ripped that off and slide open the box everything was so shiny! So at this point I am super excited and have nothing but high hopes. So I put them in and couldn’t believe how loud they were only to realize that the volume was at only about 20%! They are so loud and the bass is super nice. They seal in your ear well and cancel at most outside sound while listening to music. Definitely going to have a learning curve on the touch pad area but I’ll figure it out. Overall I think they are wonderful so far, I have not wore them to work yet which involves a lot of walking, bending, squatting, so we shall see if everything stays great!",5,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0
"I have always used wired earbuds because I was concerned about the quality of bluetooth and the high prices of earbuds. Also, most of my personal listening for years has been on an old iPod--no bluetooth! I have started doing more biking and running recently and the wires were always in the way or getting caught on my bike helmet, causing the buds to fall out. So, I researched for wireless for my iPhone 7. Apple's are too pricey and I was concerned about fit, as I have never been able to use the wired headphones provided with the iPhone. My research in the under $50 range led me to the T6 and it has been great. The paired easily and the charge has been good for several days of biking and running. The sound is good and I definitely get the base others have mentioned. They stay tight in my ears, even with vigorous movements. They are a momentary challenge to get out of the case at times, but saving $100 + over Apple makes that a minor problem.",5,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0
"Great product, the sound quality is excellent and with both earbuds in your ears, outside noises are fairly muted. Also the size of the charging case is very small and does not take up a lot of room in your pocket.An excellent feature is the waterproof capability. The instructions actually write that they are fit to use in the shower. However if soap or water touches them it changes the volume as they are touch sensitive.",4,1,2020-6-14,1,0,1
"So far i am very pleased.  They arrived in time.  They were well packaged and were ready to use out of the box.  It only took a few seconds to pair to my tablet and i assume the same can be said for my phone.  The sound quality is as good or better as the wired Samsung earbuds They are replacing.  They come with 6 ear pieces of different sizes.Update:  after using for several days, there seems to be an issue with the left ear bud.  Tozo has top notch customer service so far.  They are sending me a new pair for replacement.",5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,1
"When my AirPods kept falling out of my ear during my workouts, I knew it was time for different earbuds. Not wanting to spend a premium, I poured over many reviews for different earbuds and came upon the TOZO T6. These earbuds have great sound quality, many different tips to ensure fit, and connect with my iPhone without any issues immediately, every time. And the wireless charging makes it super convenient. Definitely one of the best bang for your buck earbuds available on the market.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,0,0
The first time when connecting it pairs with ease.. when I started playing music on them like any other speaker in the world it has to go through a break in period about 3 to 7 days of use. So the bass will sound sluggish and loose and the treble will sound hissy...The product sounds great after the break in period with nice tight punchy bass and cleaner treble the sound is more define as softer sounding. While giving you a natural life like sound that keeps you engaged in what ever entertainment your listing to. On my Note 10+ I used the Dolby Atmos switched on witch enhance the experience... Move sound traks sound real good..,5,1,2019-10-13,1,0,1
They fit. I have small ears. I always need the small covers for my ears. I was super worried that these would fall out. Never happens. They fit and my ears are not irritated.

"I wear these earbuds at home so that I can focus on my homework and block out all of the talking and yelling that goes in in my house! Noise cancellation is AWESOME. My dad can be talking to me 1 foot away and I cannot hear him. These earbuds cancel noise even when volume is only at 60-70% so that is pretty awesome compared to apple's 1st gen airpods that don't cancel noise at ALL. Secondly, I love that they provide like 5 or 6 sizes so that the buds can actually fit in your ears... I've struggled so much finding bluetooth headphones that won't start making my ears ache!!!! These are comfortable even with hours of wear..... definitely 5/5 stars and a bang for your buck. Oh yeah and the bass on these is perfect",5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0

Quick pairing, great sound, OK microphone (functional for calls but not something I'd want to rely on, especially if on an important call - I did the mic test on a Zoom session and the audio comes back a little crackly).I changed out the tips to smaller ones (there are 5 additional sets of tips in the box) because my ears are small :) The ones with the red on the inside of the tips seem to make these earbuds sound fuller/more bassy than the completely black ones at the bottom, possibly because of the seal shape. I still might change them out to the smallest pair of black tips because the ""red"" ones are slightly uncomfortable for me. (Again... small ears.)",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"I received the TOZO T10 as a Christmas gift.  I loved them so much I decided to get the new TOZO T6 to have an extra set.  I read the reviews and figured these would be a great choice.  These two are my first venture into the wireless world. First of all, they were SO EASY to pair.  I'm 60 yrs old and not overly tech savvy.... LOL, so easy.Second, the price is great, sound quality awesome and I love the smaller T6 weight and case size.  I listen to a lot of audiobooks and use my TOZO's everyday.  If you're looking for a great pair of wireless headphones, don't hesitate, buy them now!  I think I'll be getting mire as gifts as well.  Love love love them.",5,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
"Just charged up and tried out my new Tozo T6 ear buds.  I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews and decided to go with the T6 buds.  So far, very happy.  Great sound.  Nice bass, strong but not overwhelming.  Charging case is great, very compact and charges up very quickly with a wireless charger pad.  Buds also came to full charge very quickly.  The bud tap control provides all controls for music (volume up/down, track advance/replay, play/pause and also all controls for phone (answer/hang up/reject call).  The tap control requires a little practice but once you've got it, its a piece of cake.  Easy and immediate pairing with multiple devices.  Great price performer, the T6s provide everything (and in some cases more) than name brand buds that cost 3-5 times as much.  Great purchase!",5,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"Tozo T6 bluetooth ear buds are the best!  Much lighter than the T10's, and so comfortable to wear.  The sound quality is so clear and everyone I talk to can hear me too!  I love them for playing music, talking to Siri (this is effortless with these buds), and talking to people.  Battery life is exceptional with no less than 6 hrs of continuous music/talking, I use one bud at a time and recharge using the case.  I still getting used to the touch features, but are very nice.  This bundle is good for all day comfort and use.",5,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"I got this on the Cyber Monday sale for $42. I had bought 2 more sets of wireless Earphones under $40. But with one, I wasn't satisfied with the build quality, I felt the cheap plastic in it. Another I did not like the sound quality, it was too flat without any ups and downs in treble or bass (Also keep in mind both weren't a wireless Charging unit)I am more concerned about the bass effect & the built quality as well as the price.",5,1,2019-12-11,1,0,0
"Liked: Charged fast right out of the box on a wireless charger, it was already 3/4 charged. Once taken out of the charging box they pair right away without me doing anything. Easy pairing to the OnePlus 8. The sound quality is crisp and sharp. I have extremely loud tinnitus and these work great for me. The extra earbud fittings were a great help for my large ears.Con  I'm thinking . . . . . .",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0

"I really wanted to like these but they refuse to pair with each other. I tried all of the suggested tricks to get it to work (power off, Bluetooth off, forget devices, reset) but they refuse to pair together. It's a real shame because I liked the idea of being able to connect only one at a time. In the same way though, these are basically useless if they do not pair together. Very dissatisfied.",1,1,2019-10-21,1,3,0
"Love love love my new T6 earbuds! I had been getting INUNDATED with ""raycon"" ads on YouTube as of late. Looked them up and at an $80 price point, not bad... typed raycon in at Amazon to see if i could find a better price, and ran into that bad boys! 35k reviews and basically 5 stars?? Plus add ons of a silicone case protector AND wireless charger for $60!!?? It was a no brainer. Awesome sound at an awesome price. Definitely suggest for ANYONE  wanting some wireless earbuds!",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"I love love loooveeee these headphones! Ordered these for my birthday and I’m testing them out now! Absolutely love these. I have small ears so I made sure to get some wireless headphones that have the option to switch the earbuds, I switched to the second smallest size and they fit perfectly! I was shaking my head and nodding my head back and forth to see if they would fall out and they’re just fine. They’re comfortable, great sound quality, and I love the color! The only thing I will say is the charging cable for the case is really small lol but that’s nothing. These are definitely worth your money!",5,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"The right ear bud will not charge, or turn on.  Im trying to get ahold of the company and its a mess.  I have done all they told me to do.  Wipe off the charging points, charge the case then the ear buds.  And did a factory reset.  Nothing worked.  Sent a screen shot of my order and still nothing.  Also when I did charge the case, it got extremely HOT.  Like possible fire hazard hot.  I'll be asking for a refund when/if they get back to me again.",1,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"The TOZO T6 earbuds work well for listening to talk audio - news, audio books, etc.  The sound is clear and sharp and has plenty of volume.  I have only used them twice so far and haven't listened to music, so can't comment on their music capability.  I also haven't used to them to make a phone call yet so can't comment on that capability either.  Although they are securely mounted in my ears, they sometimes feel like they might fall out, so I find myself frequently adjusting them.  I recently lost one of my previous earbuds (different brand) to a storm sewer when it suddenly popped out of my left ear, hence my caution.  Overall, I'm reasonably happy with this purchase.",4,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0

"These are awesome!I was given a pair to test out, and I can say after a bit over a week that I am sold. The packaging is sleek, the earbuds are comfortable and fit neatly in the ear (better than AirPods), and the sound quality is perfectly acceptable for a product this size. Good overall balance, decent bass. The battery life seems very good so far. The fact that they're waterproof is a massive incentive, and they are snug enough that I would see myself running with them.",5,1,2019-10-9,1,0,1
"I am so highly impressed with these earbuds.  I have only had them for a few days but before this I had a pair of Beats Bluetooth earbuds. Sure the sound was good, but it was constantly giving me issues with connectivity. They also died within a year.As of yet Iv been clear across my house from my phone and these tozo earbuds still have a great connection. The sound quality is great. The bass is perfect and they are super noise cancelling. Family members have had to throw things at me to get my attention because I couldn’t hear them calling me.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"I just got these and so far so good. Sound quality is excellent. Listened to Catastrophist by Trivium out of the gate and wow! Solid sound. Plenty of Bass without being boomy and muddy, clear mids and crisp highs. I could even hear the cymbal bells in the mix. Touch controls work flawlessly and these have more touch contol features than I've ever had on wireless earbuds. These are a fraction of the cost of big name earbuds and I think an amazing value. I haven't used them long enough to comment on actual battery life, but other reviews have said they do last as long as Tozo claims.",5,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0
"UPDATE: DO NOT BUY! They fall out WAY too easily! One ear literally just fell out of my ear! I wish I could give a rating lower than 1 star!I work 10 hours a day, and travel 1-2 hrs each way. The battery does not last. I also randomly lose my connection. I’ms sitting right next to my phone, and then it tells me Link or Connection Lost (I do not remember the exact message, I just know it disconnects from my phone for a minute or two.)",1,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0

"Just got these.  So far they seem to be great.  I have to get used the tapping to track forward and back and the volume control but it will become second nature.  The sound quality is very clear.  I was hoping they had more bass but it isn't a deal breaker for me. The waterproof feature is a cool addition.  The biggest plus is they seem to be great for small ears.  I have never had buds stay in my ears and these do.  For that alone, they get 5 stars!",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"The T6s are fantastic for the gym, work, even the shower (as if you really need headphones in the shower). I've used them in a number of locations and for various activities, and they work great. They sound phenomenal. The only caveats I have are likely mentioned in previous reviews: They are a little slick for when taking out and putting back into the case, occasionally leading to inadvertently playing your music; and they seal VERY well. The caveat about them sealing very well is really a double-edged sword - you get crystal clear audio with little outside noise, but if you want to keep both headphones in and just stop your music in order to have a conversation, you'll likely be disappointed. That's not a flaw, that's the price you pay for a good seal and noise cancellation. The wireless charging function is awesome! I highly recommend these. This is an honest review provided in exchange for a promotional product from the seller.",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"The headphones sound great, and they are pretty comfortable. 4 stars for sound. Rich clear sound and pretty powerful at higher volume. Using them for phone calls is also very good. No issues with sound quality at all, me hearing them, or them hearing me. They say 6 hours of use. From a full charge, they lasted 4 hours for me. Again, the sound is great, and I am very picky.",4,1,2020-3-22,1,1,0
"With these I like the noise cancelling it really does drown out the outside. High quality sound which I really like in headphones, good bass. The battery life is good and case charge. I also like the touch controls, all you have to do is tap or hold with your finger on your ear like a secret agent. I bought these for work because the wired ones kept getting caught up and messed up ( I unload cabinets off trucks in a warehouse so I constantly lifting all kinds of heavy stuff past my ears and head). I sweat profusely and they stay working and stay in my ear. Being hands free is very useful and these get the job done. Havent found anything I dislike honestly yet either. Maybe just a little tougher charging case or option to buy a tougher case, that's about it. Overall really good earbuds and really good price. Airpods are nice to have if you can afford that stuff but these work just as well for the purpose. They look good in your ear too, not too bulky or anything, they look like a legit earpiece... like I said a secret agent 😎 they look cool",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,1
"I have tried T6 for few days no and had no problem using it since I am AIRPODS user for few years and never thought I will change to other bods. However, while using my AirPod in the gym I suffer to keep them in my ears when running and exercising so I thought I should get a one that actually stick inside my ears. After intensive searching throughout many products and reviews I found the T6. Very good sound, waterproof, multi function and stick inside my ears while heavy moving. I am glad to have them as gym bodies.",5,1,2019-11-8,1,1,0
"Pretty great earbuds! They fit pretty well, and come with like five different size and type of buds to try, so I’m still trying to find the perfect ones for my ears. They cancel noise pretty well, and the battery life seems retry great so far! I’ve used them off and on over the week and haven’t had to charge the case once, and if still shows a full charge.

"1. For laptop:I wanted this earbud to pair with my laptop and make calls via messenger. Unfortunately, it did not support the messenger calls. I have Dell Inspiron 3793 laptop with windows 10 pro and have Bluetooth 4.1. However, the earbuds are perfect for listening to music and watching movies via my laptop Bluetooth connection. That is how I ended up giving 5 stars.",5,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0

I seriously considered returning the product over the microphone malfunction issue, but after reading reviews saying they have excellent customer service, I decided to give them a chance to fix the problem and I am happy to report they definitely did so. Register your product and contact them via email if you have any issues, they are very responsive. Overall, very happy with this purchase and would purchase it again. For this price, you can’t beat the deal.",5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
Absolutely love these wireless Bluetooth earbuds!  These are the first earbuds that I have ever used that were comfortable right from the start.  These earbuds do come with a variety of different size ear plugs for a perfect fit.  They are so comfortable.  Love the easy touch controls.  I have to say these were the easiest Bluetooth accessories to pair that I ever had.  And the sound quality - WOW!,5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,1
"I've tried several different ear buds in the last 60 days to find one that has clear full spectrum of sound- clear highs, rich bass, by far the TOZO model T6 blow away every model I've tried. For the $50 price point you can't go wrong, they even give the higher priced brands a clear run for the money. Trust me you will be pleased - Logical touch controls are a nice feature you normally only find on higher priced models, and don't forget the long battery life.",5,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
"I bought these for my husband because he hates my AirPods although I live by them and these were very comfortable for him but the sound is not good. The other reviews were good so maybe were just picky but I know that any song that doesn’t have a lot of bass sounds awful! They are amazing in every other way and if you only listen to rap or reggae they sound great with that but any rock or alternative, not good!",2,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"These ear buds are 110% then Galaxy Ear Buds, I bought these because I needed a pair, but then I bought a Galaxy Note 10 plus and it came with the Galaxy buds for free, I tried out both, The TOZO buds are perfect for jogging and even running, ive done many sprints with these ear buds, I haven’t swam in these because I’m just too scared, but I’ve used these in the rain it still performs perfectly, The noise canceling is dangerous good, I literally can’t hear anything so if you work in a warehouse, definitely only put one bud on but for the Galaxy Buds, they randomly fall off your ear when even walking and sprints it’s even worse, maybe I just don’t have the ear for them or something but I wouldn’t recommend for running, TOZO’s YES... only issues I’ve seen with the TOZO is 2, when I’m not listening to music or not using the buds, they randomly disconnect and say “Disconnected” then 10 seconds later they reconnect. 2nd issue isn’t when I sometimes openMy phone it just randomly says “Maximum Volume” even though it’s at half or so... overall, these are the best buds for the price. I definitely recommend more then the Galaxy buds",5,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
"So I just started using these earbuds. I’m pairing them with my laptop for lectures (primary purpose), and so far they are working as expected. Sound has some echo, I checked with different videos from different sources, but it doesn’t bother me too much. Touch pad is working, pairing was fast and easy, which usually isn’t the case with my laptop. I haven’t charged them yet, and I don’t know how long this charge will last, so I might update the review.UPDATE: After the first charge, the sound is produced like from under water. They also turn on on there own even after I turn them off several times. RETURN! I got a replacement and had the same exact issue...",1,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0

"So, I'm kind of late to the earbud game. This is my first pair, and I LOVE THEM. They charge quickly, and being able to charge them in their case? Without a cord? Amazing! I also love that the case has the wireless charging feature, so I can set it down and forget it - until I need it! I also think that the small design of these is far more attractive than those dangly-looking white things you see people with. Oh, and the sound? It's great too!! I would purchase these earbuds again (and just might, for a Christmas gift!)",5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"This is truly 5 stars. The most important feature is that they have all the touch controls listed and they work amazingly and are perfectly sensitive. I made sure to include a photo of the touch control instructions that I find are better than the pictures provided on the page. The T10 (previous model) had no song skip, so what controls the T6 has and how they work mattered a lot to me.The next important thing for me is that they fit great and are comfortable. TOZO gives you three extra sets of different-sized tips (as you can see from my photo) in case the default set doesn’t fit or are uncomfortable — other products don’t do this I believe. I do a lot of walking and never felt them move out of place.",5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,1
"They are just ok for listening to music and wireless charging of the case is a nice feature, but the mic is absolutely useless. Forget about taking calls with these, the person on the other end won't be able to hear you at all. Contacted the seller and they acknowledged that this was a known issue with the product. Buyer beware.",2,1,2020-1-21,1,1,0
"Very pleased. My daughter has the T10 and recommended I get a pair. I opted for the T6 because they are slightly smaller as is the recharging carrying case. I’ve had a set of BOSE headphones and MPOW earbuds, but these are my favorite so far. Sound is great. It’s going on a week and the carrying charger is only 50% depleted (I listen to music and audible books about 3 hrs/day). The fit is perfect. With my BOSE and MPOW I could only use them for maybe 2 hrs before they felt uncomfortable but with the T6 I can even use them as earplugs when I’m not listening to anything, they are that comfortable.",5,1,2019-11-1,1,1,0

"Love everything about these ear buds except the sound quality. It's not horrible or makes me want to send them back or throw them away, just not as good as I was hoping for since I use them almost exclusively for music and or movies.

Battery life is great.",3,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"I like these headphones. I got them to replace my aurpods when they broke. The touch controls are really convenient. They come with multiple sizes for the rubber ear piece, but they still hurt my ears. The reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I don't like how they fit. They're a lot more bulky so I can't listen to them while laying down, they hurt my ears, and they don't feel as comfortable. The sound quality is great, but I don't love the fit. I don't think I would buy them again but I'm happy enough with them.",4,1,2020-5-26,1,1,0
"I already own a TOZO product which is the T10 and it is still alive and well, I just needed another pair since I do listen to music a lot especially at work or whenever I have free time. The T6 is an ""upgrade"" to my T10 due to its extra features like touch control. The sound quality is great, one would wonder that a non-popular brand is ""sketchy"" but having owned two of these, I'd say they are on par with branded ones. It does its job well, which is to play audio without any annoying wires that get in the way. Overall, great product, a good purchase on my end.",5,1,2020-7-28,1,1,0

"These headphones are great in a lot of ways: the sound quality is great, the battery life is long, and they’re comfortable. The problem comes with the touch control.

"So far so good. I've tried many different Bluetooth earbuds over the last few years with mixed success. These have easily been the best combination of price and features. From what I can tell, they are a well thought out product. I have not had to reset them, or repair them once since purchasing them, and have used them near daily. I have used them for hours at a time, and have yet to have the battery die on me. I really like the wireless charging feature. Initially they didn't appear to work with my current charger, until I flipped them upside down. The charge point must simply be near the bottom of the case.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,1

You have the option to use both, or either one singly on it's own which is awesome for working in the kitchen! The sound quality is great, and I have yet to have any issues at all getting them to stay. They sit it my ears and stay there firmly throughout my chaotic day which is a relief to not have to adjust them every 4 seconds. Also, the battery life is outstanding! I can make it all the way through work and still have battery life left.

I actually like their configuration better than my daughter’s AirPods.",4,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
When I bought my galaxy s10 it came with galaxy buds for free.  Those were great and ofc worked perfectly with my phone.  At some point they went missing and I haven't been able to find them at all.  I missed having wireless buds so I did some homework and bought these.  Absolutely the best replacement ever.  So incredibly crisp in sound and design.  Fit great in the ear.  Totally worth the price.  And I can still charge the case from my wireless IQ charger and phone.,5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"First off these earbud sound incredible, the highs and mids are great but damn the bass is nice and powerful without muddying the highs or mids. Now these earbuds have passive noise canceling (the silicon ear tip creates a vacuum in the ear) but it doesnt have active noise canceling, which is totally fine for earbuds. These earbuds are IPX8 waterproof which means you can do pretty much anything with them, I even take showers with them in and no problems other than the hot water can sometimes be mistaken as a finger tap. You may need to try some of the other ear tips that come in the package to find the right seal for it to stay in your ears but the come with a bunch of replacement tip sizes so there shouldn't be any worry about that. The earbuds charging case has a lot of charge and I don't usually have to charge it for at least 2 days but that is just me, The case also supports wireless charging which is absolutely incredible. All in all I would buy these again and I would buy these for family members as gifts. I am very happy I took a chance and bought these.",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,1

They tried to help me reset them to see if it would fix the problem. The reset did not fix them so they offered to replace it in order to fix the issue.

The sound quality is phenomenal and I am a little picky when it comes to my headphones. Usually I find that a pair's sound levels are only on the extreme with no middle ground that won't harm my eardrums but I've messed around with the various levels and they're better than I expected.",5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0

I will update again in 3 months and maybe the ones I had were just a fluke.Really loved them for the 39 days they worked.

He reported that after a week or so, the sound in the right earbud was off, but he did not bring them to me until the right earbud had quit working altogether, somewhere around the 3 month range in usage.I contacted the company and they walked us through some troubleshooting techniques. When none of them worked, they offered to send a new pair to my son in return for a review. They responded to our emails in less than 24 hours each time and were very nice. My son did receive a new pair of earbuds that worked.  Good customer service.",4,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"These are great wireless earphones and sound great!! Love the case that charges them up when not in use!! Keep in mind that you have to charge the case every so often!! I like the fact there is no wires, thought touch function gets a little getting used too! The are a bit sensitive, but once you are used to them and the functions of the earphones, you will love them! Would definitely recommend and buy again!!",5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"Have never had buds before and thought I'd try these from all of the positive reviews. Got them for the gym and pool. Easy to pair, sound quality is good even though it could be louder.... I have 60 year old roadie ears... but overall really good product. At first they didn't fit quite right but I changed the ear plug part and they fit fine. Shook my head around and they stayed put. Again, great plugs for the money. My niece with her $200.00 air buds seems jealous.",5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
"The sound quality is not bad.  My problem with them is they will not stay in my ears.  Constantly pushing them in is a pain.  The controls are built in to the buds and every time you touch them the do something...skip ahead, skip back, stop or change the volume.UPDATE",4,1,2020-3-20,1,1,0
"The sound, battery life, case size, and touch sensitivity are all great, but I can't recommend these because they keep sliding out of my ears. They stay in fine if there is zero earwax in your ear, but have them in for more than a half hour and they become slick and keep sliding instantly out until you clean them and your ear again. It is very annoying. The big fault is that the design of the earbuds doesn't take advantage of resting on your ear at all, so they are held in place solely by the pressure of the rubber earbud inside your ear. The human ear constantly produces earwax, especially when something is jammed inside your ear canal, so these will slip out. It's a shame, because the rest of the design is great.",2,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
"Just received these today and very disappointed in the sound quality for music. No depth- have asked other reviewers for advice on possibly making adjustments in settings to improve sound quality, perhaps I will call the customer support line. If I can't find a way to improve it I will return them.  I will update this review when I have more info.On the other hand, if I needed a pair wireless ear buds strictly for meetings / calling people, I would recommend these due to ease of connectivity and price point.",1,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"TLDR: These are a fantastic wireless earbud option. Great sound clarity, battery life, IPX8, and value. Of the wireless earbuds I've owned these have so far been my favorite.The battery life of the earbuds was one of the main reasons I bought these. I can typically leave them in through the morning at work until I take lunch and not be anywhere near low battery. With the charging case I'm pretty much set for a couple of days between work, the gym, and just on my home computer. Keep in mind, I tend to keep the volume somewhat low but it takes a good while to reach even 50% battery.",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"This was my first foray into wireless earbuds.  I wanted something that worked well and was relatively inexpensive, so I wouldn't risk much if it turned out I didn't like using them.  These earbuds fit the bill.  Sound quality is awesome 95% of the time - once in a blue moon there is static.  It's connection is great too - I've been more than 30 feet away and still had good sound.  It takes some time to get used to the touch controls, but they are fairly responsive.  Comfortable to wear for long periods.. Battery life is solid at about 4 hours, and charging is simple with or without Qi. The only thing that would make these the ultimate value wireless earbuds is Bluetooth connections to multiple devices at the same time.  That might be a lot to ask for for $40-$50, but we can all hope right?",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
Nice ear buds. Easy to use. Sound is good. For the price point not bad at all. You can use just one ear bud and wireless charging is nice. They’re not AirPods but I’m not going to feel bad if I lose them like I did my AirPods.Used maybe a dozen times and one earbud has quit working. Contacted seller and they were very quick to respond and offer a replacement earbud. I hope it lasts much longer as I am overall pretty happy with these.,1,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0
"Got these as an upgrade for the previous Tozo Bluetooth wireless earbuds. Great upgrade, they sound great, come with more earbud options to make sure they fit comfortably in your ears, and now include being able to skip or rewind songs on the earbuds themselves.Definitely recommend if you’re thinking about upgrading from the previous model or if you’re looking for nice quality and reasonably priced earbuds.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"Overall, this product is great.The product itself has a very premium feel. From the box down to the earbuds and everything in between. The touch sensitivity is great. I have no trouble connecting through controls and whatnot. The case has a nice matte finish and doesn't leave any fingerprints behind. It's a high quality product for it's price.",4,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
"The earbuds are comfortable, fit nicely, great sound, and decent battery life. I found the touch controls to be difficult to work with - triggered when adjusting the product, adjusting face mask, and adjusting glasses. My previous earbuds had mechanical buttons and worked better for me.These are good, I just haven't been able to adjust to the touch sensitivity always triggering when I don't want it to.",3,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
I've had these 60 seconds and I'm in love. The case is adorable and wireless charging? Heck yeah! They get loud and I set them up in 15 seconds.  They are responsive and I didnt even realize I can connect to alexa. 3 taps and I just asked her the weather and she answered in my ears then right back to my music. Best 40$ ever. Will update with any issues or down falls but for now im super happy.,5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,1
Update-Tozo was very responsive to this review and emailed me the manual and was very helpful. Buds have nice sound quality and are comfortable. For that I’ll update review to 5 stars. Received package and unboxed it.  This is my first pair of touch wireless ear buds. Would love to know how the features work! No user manual included!  Went on YouTube and internet and tried dot locate owners manual and seems I’m supposed to guess at how this is work.  Frustrating.  Sound quality is good as I someohoe turned on music.  But I need this for work and would have been nice to have had users manual as not everyone is as tech savvy. So for that I give rating if 2. If I can’t find Manuel they are going back,5,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
"I have another pair of earbuds from this company....and these Are the BEST YET!!!!!!.....These connected easy, The sound is....... OMG!!!!!  Deep rich sound.  The bass is excellent!!!!  They came fully charged, and the case they are stored in for charging is smaller and can easily fit in a pocket!!!!They also cancel out noise great!!!!",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"Because I had this issue with two previous pairs from as many brands, upon receiving these I immediately put them in (connection was easy) phoned a friend to test sound quality. He heard everything in the background and could barely hear me. I called another friend who complained of the same. Too much background noise. When listening to music, the quality is great. I actually talk more on the phone this listen to music so noise cancellation is important. Unfortunately I have to return these.",3,1,2020-3-19,1,1,0
They don’t sound that great. They actually sound cheap. There’s not much for treble. It’s a muffled sound. They are surprisingly comfortable though. The controls are just tapping on the bud. It makes it difficult. My Spotify will turn on and play through them when I just touch them like putting them back in the case. It’s kind of annoying. I don’t like that you have to use a charging pad. I wish there was a port to just plug them in. The phone sucks. The wife says she can hear me better when my phone is on speaker phone.,2,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"So far I absolutely love these earbuds! I’ve been using Powerbeats Wireless for years and they finally broke on me, so I wanted to replace them with something a little more modern but not overly priced. I just got these today and they are amazing. Sound quality is the same if not better than the Powerbeats! For a third of the price! The touch features all work as described, and all of the different sized ear pieces are a nice thing to have. I’ll have to see how they hold up over time, the battery life, and other things, but they made a great first impression on me! Ordering a second pair for my mom because she liked them so much as well!UPDATE— Second pair is just as great as the first! We both use them everyday and so far they’re still exceeding my expectations! Highly recommend!",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"Great earbuds! I was skeptical at first, but these are a very comparable and affordable alternative to Apple AirPods. My main headphones are a pair of Audio Technica ATH M50Xs, so I am used to high quality audio. These earbuds are well-made and the sound quality is fantastic—good bass response, not muddy at all, and not too sharp/trebly. Stereo image is nicely balanced. Noise cancelling is great too. The touch control features are also amazing and have me feeling like I’m living in 2200. You can pause, play, skip tracks on your playlists as well as answer, hold, or reject phone calls—all by tapping one of the earbuds! The microphone also has a good frequency response—perfect for Zoom, Skype, or FaceTime. Really impressed with these earbuds and I recommend them to anyone! They come with multiple changeable earbuds of different sizes so anyone can buy these with the confidence that these earbuds will fit great, sound great, and look great, too! Pairing With Bluetooth was so simple I got them working without reading the instructions (although they’re worth reading to learn each touch command,etc.) 10/10!",5,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
[edit]I've had the earbuds for about two months now and I've had a few issues. occasionally they'll randomly turn off when im connected to my phone or computer. and most recently the right earbud has suddenly gotten a lot quieter than the left. happend in the middle of a zoom lecture. ive been unable to remidy the issue and I dont know what to do.,1,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
Update:They lasted 2 months but one of the ear buds has failed. the sound fades in and out. The touch control still works but hearing anything from it is unreliable. Super bummed about this as I really liked these ear buds.,1,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"I came across these earbuds after having to make the transition from an iPhone 6s to the new iPhone 11 Pro Max. Goodbye headphone jack. I didn’t want to pay for the outrageously priced apple AirPods. The Tozo T6 Earbuds charging case looks about the same size as the AirPods case, it fits nicely in the palm of my hand. There’s a light indicator to show the level of charge left. The earbuds fit inside the case via magnets it seems and I have to admit it’s sometimes difficult for me to get the earbuds out of the case, but no worries about them falling out.I use these earbuds during my commute back and forth from work to home and when I’m out and about. I have to say I’m super impressed by the noise isolation, the fit of the earbuds are snug like earplugs. I pretty much can’t hear any outside noise with these on, which is great because I barely have to pump up the volume. I still have yet to charge the case since fully charging it upon receiving the earbuds, which has been about 3 weeks, it depends on your usage. The touch controls on the earbuds are also pretty handy. The earbuds fit in either ear and look pretty sleek and non-assuming unlike AirPods. I personally don’t like the look of AirPods in the ear.",5,1,2019-12-20,1,0,1
"This review doesn't include rating the phone features, only streaming music, which is the only reason I bought them. I was looking to cut the cord to my headphones and as a high fidelity addict I was looking at the $200 price range (Bose, etc.). I wasn't quite sure if I wanted to make the leap at that expense just to stream music from my high end MP3 player at the gym as that activity just involved passive listening while focusing on my workout. I came across these while searching using the ""4 Star or Greater"" filter. For the price they can't be beat. The sound quality is very good and the build quality seems very good as well. Highly recommended!",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"The sound is very acceptable and decent for the price, it has a nice bass. They fit perfectly in the ears and if the buds that already come installed don't fit, you get 3 other pairs to change them and make sure they do not fall. The distance they cover is also great and you can be totally hands free with them as long as you don't go very far from the phone. I love them, and for the price you cannot complaint (at least on my experience). Now the cardio sessions will be more enjoyable without them annoying cables.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"Can use one bud at a time to maximize the use time to almost always on.  Great sound quality.  Only down side is they are so smooth on the finish they are a bit tricky to remove from their storage case.  The fit in the ear is very good and the touch to change, pause, answer, mute, etc. Is very easy.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,1,0
"I like them a lot but for some reason like 30 minutes after getting them the left one continues to act like its being pressed which means it lowers my volume which gets quite annoying because the only way I can stop it is by putting it in the charging case therefore only using one of them. I took a shower with them to test the quality of them (range, and soundproofness) and to see if they were really waterproof (since it said showers were ok) so I'm thinking that might be it? Something must've went wrong with the touch screen but its strange that its only one, and that it was like 10 minutes after my shower that the issue popped up.Other than that I really like the product because the range is better than I expected having used wireless earbuds before and the range being way worse than this, plus these feel secure and after 5 hours of usage they haven't fallen out. Battery life is alright about on par with expectations for wireless things. So if you do want wireless headphones these are a pretty good pair to go for considering the high quality and reasonable price. Just be careful of taking them into a shower I guess.",4,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"So far i really love the product, ive only had them a few hours but they seem really good. I have nothing to compare them with as they are my first wireless ear buds. The earbuds paired and connected to my samsung note within seconds so nothing to complain about there. I did notice a slight hum when they are connected and no audio is being played but it doesnt bother me. I have not really messed with the controls so i cant attest to how good they are. Overall so far they are great calue for the price compared to other brands for 3 times the money or more.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
"Earbuds performed great for the last three months.  Paired with Samsung S9 Plus for work-out music, around the house listening, and casual videos.  Did not use for phone calls.  Performance and price were so good we purchased a second pair for our daughter.This week one of the buds stopped working.  While we have no idea of the cause, we inquired about the one year warranty through e-mail.  Customer service has been solid thus far as they asked us to try three basic troubleshooting techniques and then offered to send a replacement when those did not work.",4,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"I have never tried wireless headphones and honestly was buying these just as an entry-point in to see how I would feel about them. I had planned to buy a better or more expensive pair after determining if I liked them or not... But I'm keeping them! These are amazing. Great noise cancelation, they paired quickly, they stay put while I'm walking and running. I'm super happy with this purchase!",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"The sound quality is pretty good and they fit snug in my ears. However a major annoyance is that when you put them in their case to charge they don’t always charge, even if I wiggle them to get the red light on they are empty the next day. Also they are suppose to turn off when they are in their case. This happens about 60% of the time, other times I’m playing something on my phone and no sound comes out and I realize it’s because they are still on in the case.To summarize. The case sucks. The sound quality good. I run in these and they do the job. I’m very likely returning these if I can (I log in to return and just did the review first)",2,1,2019-12-6,1,1,0
"My old bluetooth earphones had recently broken and I was in the market for a solid pair. These headphones are amazing, the trebles are crisp and clear and the bass is nice and punchy, without being muddy.

Definitely would recommend for those looking to get the most out of their dollar.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,1,0
"I purchased these ear buds because they had positive reviews. I wasn’t expecting much for less than 50 dollars but boy was I ever WRONG. These little guys pack a mean punch sound wise, now I own air pods but they are not waterproof and they can easily fall out. But these bad boys don’t move not even while running or swimming. They look really good on and they are small. So it doesn’t draw much attention to the ear. The case is just as nice as the big A. Totally would say buy them you won’t regret it. I know I don’t",5,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"Sound quality and bass are amazing and immersive. Product packaging wasn't cheaped out on and unboxing the product was a fun experience. Its waterproof and it comes with a variety of ear tips. Plus the charging case is wireless. The microphone isnt the focus of the product but your voice is definitely audible to othersOnly complaints are that the touch functions aren't as good as airpods. When you try to go to another track youll hear either reverse or forward. In a way it interrupts your listening and is one of the cheap aspects of the product. That being said unlike the airpods you can raise volume, skip/go back a track, pause/play and answer calls. Airpods only have one touch function with the double tap and with these you have all of them.",4,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"These headphones are very useful and convenient. Highly recommend them if you are looking for a good replacement for your old wireless headphones or planning to purchase a new one.

The dealer is very helpful and one can contact them if they have any issues or questions regarding the product.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0

So far I have been able to quickly pair with my phone and use the touch controls which are very intuitive.  Good sound so far.  I am gonna try these out on a bike ride today and a run tomorrow and will update my experience.  Happy so far and hopeful.UPDATE.  I have used these for a couple days now and WOW!  Beyond my expectations.  They stay very nicely in my ear while running for 30 minutes.  I then had a 45 minute conversation on the phone with them in and they worked flawlessly. After that I went on a bike ride for 1.5 hours along roads, paved trails and some off road and no problems.  The battery life is great.",5,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0
"Personally, I LOVE these wireless headphones because they provide so much quality for such a cheap price! At first I thought this product was too good to be true, however, I was proven wrong.

If you are considering to purchase this product you definitely should!",5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0
"If you are looking for a reasonably priced pair of wireless earbuds, look no more. These pack quite a punch. I run with these  often and the sound never cuts out. For a a cheaper pair of earbuds they also pack some good sound and bass.  I also can't say enough about the case which can easily fit in a pair of pants or shorts. I take these to the gym often and they are great. The only downside to these is if you are trying to adjust the buds they are sensitive to where you can pause them or shuffle to the next song on an accident. Overall though, these are great. Would buy them again. Oh wait I did that already when I lost my first pair. I didn't even hesitate to purchase these again. Don't waste your money on expensive earbuds.",5,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"A friend told me about these earbuds after I had mentioned that the ones I was using had fallen apart. I'm so glad I ordered a pair for myself, they're great! Sound quality is great, and they're louder than the previous popular Amazon brand buds I had. Long battery life on the buds and the charging case, which is a clone of the compact airpods case but better since it has lights indicating the charge level. Pairing is lightning fast, and the buds pair/unpair with each other almost instantly, so I can listen with one bud or both. As far as size and comfort, the buds are quite compact, and come with several different-sized earhole pieces to fit your ear. The touch/tap controls work about as well as expected. All in all, these are fantastic buds for the money. Can't recommend them enough.",5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0

"These are light weight, have terrific battery life, and the sound & call quality is great.I have noticed that the T10 series seem to be considerably louder, with more bass, ( although that could just be due to them being louder ),  however, the T10s are overly loud in the sense that they begin to saturate and distort.  The T6 series  aren't as loud as the T10, ( though they are plenty loud ), but have great bass response, as well as a great high and mid range as well.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0

"I purchased these headphones in February and have been using them non-stop since. The weight is perfect and they seem to stay in my ears well with strenuous activity which I can not say about all wireless headphone brands. The fact that they are waterproof as well adds to the appeal because I don't have to worry about sweat or a light rainfall during my workouts ruining them. Normally I would have given these 5 starts however a few weeks ago the right headphone stopped charging and I have been unable to use the audio in it since. While I could go about using solely the left-sided piece, this defeats the purpose of noise cancellation. I contacted Tozo about the issue with the right headphone and their customer service department has been very helpful in finding a solution. I definitely give the overall product a 5/5 and customer service 5/5, however because of the short lifespan of the right earphone, I docked the stars slightly.",3,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
Really bad lag if you're watching videos of almost 2 seconds. The connection in the case can be loose so if you have case in your pocket it can randomly connect to your phone without your knowing.

"This has basically everything you would want in a set of earbuds.  Snug fit, great sound, battery lasts 6+ hours, case charges in less than an hour (either wired or wirelessly) and will recharge ear buds 3-4 times, case is small enough to carry in your pocket, great range, microphone works well, many functions can be utilized by taps on the earbuds themselves, and they’re waterproof.  Well worth the money.",5,1,2020-4-1,1,1,0
"Just got them and they feel great! Not only with the way they fit my ears, but also the quality of the charging pod and the way the ear buds snap into place.

"I had been debating buying apple airpods for the last year and I could never bring myself to spend that amount of money on something I'd probably lose the next day. But when I found this at its oh-so-low price, I couldn't resist. They arrived in good packaging, adjustable ear plugs, and a plug in charger. The quality is pretty decent, it has great range of bluetooth to the phone, easy pairing, great waterproof ability. The simple tapping commands are easy to remember and swift. My only complaints is that they look a little funky to wear, almost like you have marshmallows shoved in your ears, but I honestly don't mind. It also isnt exactly ""noise cancellation"", more like ""noise reduction"". Cordless earbuds have helped me a bunch with productivity. Make sure to clean them frecuently!",5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"These earbuds have surpassed my expectations. Sound quality is excellent, form factor is excellent. They are well designed and of high quality. They slip into case perfectly and are magnetically secure. The case provides at least two full charges and the battery life of the unit themselves is a good 4+ hours. The controls take a little practice but once you figure them out they’re super easy to use.

"This is my first time using wireless headphones and I took the time to go over MANY product reviews. The Tozo T6 had a lot of great reviews so I decided to try them and they did not disappoint. The earbuds come with a charging case that can be used via USB through your computer or wall charger, which works great. The earbud magnetizes right into the case and once you link the blu-tooth with your device they will immediately link as soon as you take them out. the range is about 50 - 60 feet before they cut out. Sound quality is good, there is a little bit of a hiss but nothing that is super noticeable, and if you're a casual user, these are fine. The ""touch"" aspect of the earbuds takes a bit to get used to but once you have it down, it's a great feature.",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"First time going with a non Apple type earbud, was a bit concerned I was going to have issues, but did some research and give the relatively low price point for wireless waterproof earbuds I purchased these  and am quite delighted with the oroducrX. These earbuds perform and fit very well.  They sound great, a little light on the bass, but vocals and mid range are clear.  Fit of earbuds are fantastic right out of the box for me.  Charging case is very similar to more expensive AirPods.  Only had them for a short awhile so we’ll see about longevity and reliability over time.  Online reviews from reputable sites seem to corroborate that these earbuds are solid!  Overall a great alternative to apple’s version which a much more competitive price point.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"These are a great deal! The packing & instructions are helpful and high quality. The product itself works great. The wireless charging for the case is an amazing feature  and something even the name brand pods don’t offer.  The only downside I can note for myself is the look of them in my ears. They stick out quite a bit and since I got pink and have a fair complexion, they do tend to look like growths coming out my ears. But I don’t care! I love them and will keep wearing them.",5,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
I do a lot of walking. I wanted something hands free and nothing wrapped around the head to tangle. I love the sound quality its not bad for the price. Calls come in pretty clear. The only thing I don't like is wearing them both at the same time. It does sound weird. I can hear my foot steps and my breathing 😅. Its something to get use too. My ears are a little small so I have to use the smallest ones or it irritates me.,5,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"I just purchased these after I gave my daughter my Airpods. I had never heard of this brand, but based on other review, I decided to take the plunge. I am very impressed. The sound quality is at least on par with the Airpods. Yes, they are larger, but they are so much less expensive. The fit is excellent and I did they feel much more secure than the Airpods (i.e., that they will not fall out). Pairing was painless. The charging case feels solid. In short, I recommend without hesitation.",5,1,2019-11-28,1,1,0
"I was buying these earbuds as a replacement for my old ones, which I thought were quite similar to these. But I was very wrong, these earbuds are infinitely better in terms of their build and sound quality, to the point that they sound as good as my headphones. Mind-boggling, coming from my older set. Unfortunately, the case that came with my earbuds is defective and refuses to charge.I decided to contact TOZO customer support, thinking in the back of my head that no good could come of it. My experiences with various customer support lines range from no response to something about as good as no response. However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that TOZO responded quickly to my request for a replacement, and offered to send another pair and case free of charge.",4,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"They aren’t especially loud and the bass isn’t especially deep (standard iPhone earbuds and AirPods have a significantly higher max volume and significantly deeper bass). They also like to randomly lose connection with my phone. But they do stay in my ears, unlike iPhone earbuds/AirPods, and the touch controls are convenient. However, the left earbud has the previous track and volume down command and the right bud has the next track and volume up command so if you generally work with only one earbud in like me you won’t get both the previous/next and volume up/down commands at the same time. The battery life isn’t exactly spectacular - but if you use one at a time you can always have the other one in the charger which itself holds a good amount of charge (have yet to come close to using it all up in a day). Not a bad product and I’ll probably keep using them, but they could be better.",3,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"No complaints about the device - its about what you'd expect.Case is small, easy to carry around.  Battery life is good, you can get through a whole day.  Wireless charging is a plus.  Music sounds fine.  Tested a few phone conversations which went well - noticed some very mild echo.",4,1,2019-12-22,1,1,0
"I like the sound that these earbuds deliver however I can still hear outside noise if the volume is not in the red, which is a good thing in my opinion. The touch features take some getting used to and can be frustrating especially if you're in the middle of a call and need to turn up the volume and inadvertently hang up the phone. Also keeping up with the small case can be a challenge. For the price, the sound is good and they fit very comfortably in the ears. Overall I like these earbuds and recommend them.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"These earbuds do not disappoint.  The sound quality is excellent, if not quite as good as that of my Sony headphones.  I have used them for several hours without recharging the battery, which is sufficient for all practical purposes. They don't accidentally fall out when you do sports and the charging case is great because it also ensures that you always put them back in their case after use.  Highly recommended.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
The best thing about these is how good the sound is. These are super lightweight and comfortable and the case make it easy for your pockets. I have different earphones and right now I'm stuck with these just because the sound and the extra point of wireless charger. I'm a huge fan of Tozo and these are awesome considering price point. You don't have to break the bank to have a great sound and specs for less money. I highly recommen the T6.,5,1,2020-10-3,1,0,1
I just received these yesterday. The noise cancellation is amazing. The sound quality is pretty great as well. Not so loud to blow your ear drum but loud enough. They're fairly easy to set up. I started using them right away. Music sounds great and phone call quality is also good. Definitely recommend. ** I will update this review if anything changes. ** they do also offer a 1 year to 18 month warranty should anything happen to the buds.,5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"My key needs for these headphones are sweatproof and stay in my ears during exercise. I’ve run with them several times and no problems with sweat so far but I won’t know that for a while. I gave them four stars because it has been a bit tricky to get them to stay put. The best tips for stability are a bit  itchy. The next best are more comfortable but loosen up a bit when I’m really sweaty, however, they haven’t fallen out yet. The sound is good enough but I’m not an audiophile. Just need noise. The battery life seems OK but I put them in the charging case after working out so I haven’t really tested them yet. Give me a couple months with these thing and I’ll update this review.",4,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
Love how small the battery case is. It also came with many different ear piece sizes which is awesome. I can use either side solo which is a great help while working. This is exactly what I needed. The touch response is easy to use no issues. Wearing both really reduces any noises outside of what I am listening to. I think this is a great pair of earbuds at a very reasonable price and have already reccomend it to friends.,5,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"I was on a search for new earbuds as I had lost my EnacFire F1 earbuds (which I really liked). Initially I tried the Kurdene earbuds on amazon for about 2 seconds before returning those, had the sound quality of the complimentary airline headphones. Spent WAY too long looking at earbuds on Amazon before deciding on these. Very happy with the purchase, wish I would have just gone with the Tozo T6 right away, they are a popular option for a reason!Pros:",5,1,2020-6-17,1,0,1

"I read hundreds of earbud reviews on Amazon to find a substitute for the expensive Apple AirPod Pro. Based on the reviews here, this should have good sound quality—it doesn’t!Nice packaging, etc, but you get what you pay for. If you are used to high-end earbuds or headphones with good quality acoustic, you’ll be disappointed with these. If you are looking for something average and don’t mind lessened quality sound, these will do the job.",2,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"The earbuds work great! The default tips were perfect for me but there are a lot of fit options included.They powered right up, paired right away, and the audio latency is non existent (I am a somewhat competitive gamer and I don't notice any lag at all which impressed me).",5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0
"Finally! sound matches videos! No lag at all!Top quality clear sound. The only thing is, you can hear the bass, but don’t feel the bass. It makes you want just a little more thump.

In the past I have only purchased Bose sound devices. As money is tight at the moment I decided to explore other options. I was blown away when I came across these headphones. The first thing I noticed is that the headphones are 100% wireless with exceptional bass. As I continued to read more about the product the more I fell in love with it. It comes with a case that has an internal battery supply that allows you to charge on the go. Not to mention these are a slick comfortable design and to top it off they are waterproof and respond to touch. I’m very impressed with the level of customer service. When I received them today they came with a free gift of my choice!!! And they came with another year warranty. This is my new brand sorry Bose it was fun but you are not supplying leading edge quality at a reasonable price.,5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"I've tried several different types of ear buds, either completely wired or just wired together, this is my first fully wireless set.I have had issues with ear buds fitting (and staying!) in my ears with every other pair that I have owned, these are the best fitting (and staying!) that I've ever tried.",5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"Product was probably pretty good. Ended up returning for another product my wife liked more. Honestly, I couldn’t remove the ear buds from the case as my hands/fingers were too big. I felt like I was going to break the lid off the case eventually. Had to pay to rerun which is lame with so many other items being free to return. Oh well, they have good reviews so I’m sure they are wonderful - just not for us.",3,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"I have had them for a few days now, only issues I've run into are some latency between my phone and the earbuds, along with the other problem being the left earbud stopped working completely. Hopefully, the warranty included can easily fix this (Update: Fixed!), but only time will tell. Another ""problem"" I will add into here is the design of the earbuds which don't always feel secure in my ear, but not so much so that they would fall out of my ear.Besides those issues, everything else with these earbuds is great. The small case is basically the same rounded design of Airpods, only a little bigger. Still small enough to easily fit into my pockets. Sound quality is okay for the price point, but I have heard better from earbuds around the same price (which as of my purchase these earbuds were $50). The pairing process is really easy, although it does take 5 to 10 seconds to connect every time which did become a little annoying.",5,1,2019-10-20,1,0,0
"Why have I given 5 stars for sound and battery life but 2 stars overall? Because I bought these to use with Zoom and, as I now see other users have noted, as soon as Zoom connects these unpair and disconnect. They work fine with other apps on my Mac computer and work fine with my Android phone. I guess I'll keep them because in other functionality they are quite nice, but this is a major flaw that I hope the manufacturer can resolve. If they do, a replacement pair would be appreciated.",2,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
. I am updating my review I have had exceptional customer service from tozo they sent me a new pair of earbuds which I am trying out currently I must say this is a refreshing experience hopefully they will work better than the others and I have an 18 month warranty..so far so good would recommend them just for their customer service. If these  last for more than 6 months I will give a 5 star. In the meantime I bought a pair of Enacdfire earbuds which seem OK however  are larger  and don't fit my ears as well. I hope the tozos work out as the noise cancelling  and comfort  are superior..Ronald,4,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"So far very happy with this product! I was looking into buying air pods, but my friend had the same brand of these ear buds for me to try out. I compared them to my other friends air pods and I got to say these ones sold me! I like the fact they fit more comfortable than air pods. They don’t feel like they are going to fall out of your ears.The sound quality is AMAZING. I feel like the bass is even better than air pods.",5,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0

"I bought this wireless earbud last week, and it arrived yesterday. Honestly, I am pretty impressed with this earbud. I'm very picky when it comes to choosing an earbud, I love music so much, and lousy earbud gives you a bad experience when you listen to it. Previously, I bought several wireless earbuds from Amazon, and they were great in terms of sound and durability, but the last one was broken because I fell when I was skating lol, so I decided to buy a new one. After a few days of researching, I chose Tozo wireless earbuds because of its consumer's review, and it's also featured on several websites as best wireless earbuds of 2019!The sound is really clear and nice; I can hear the bass, the mid and high notes are also clear. In terms of the case, I love it because it's tiny, handy, and sophisticated! The design is exquisite and compact! Not to mention, both the earbuds and case are IPX 8 waterproof woohoo!",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,1
"Bottom line: terrible sound quality for low frequencies, unusable. What The Status Quote said is 100% correct, baseline EQ is way too bass-boosted so drivers constantly clip for all bass heavy music. What you hear is “crackling“. This was immediately noticeable upon first use, also when comparing with other headphones back-to-back, after re-pairing, and shifting in my ear. I thought I had a defective unit until I read other reviews. Really disappointed!",1,1,2019-10-31,1,2,0
There’s just no bass. I listen to a lot of types of music. It’s not like I’m looking for deep bass. These have none which makes everything sound tinny. It’s like there is a constant treble noise from them where the bass should be filled in.  Not anywhere near as good as my wired earbuds or my previous wireless earbuds that I’m replacing only because I broke them. I thought I’d upgrade. Nope.,2,1,2020-6-23,1,0,1
Just received the Tozo T6 today and I’m absolutely in love with them. The already have some juice on them for me to enjoy them. Popped them in and it quickly synced with my phone.I instantly played a music and the sound quality is superb!!! Bass level is great and the treble sounds are perfect. I played around with the different EQ options and was impressed. Very accurate. No blurred sounds. The noise cancellation works great I didn’t hear my daughter call me.,5,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"Terrific purchase, and on a black Friday special made this even better. I have had wireless buds before, these are much smaller form factor. Battery is good listening to music or making it through a conference call marathon. The case is small and light, fits in your pocket and you don't even know its there. Recharges the buds so you always have enough power. The best feature of the case and buds is when you take out the buds it automatically turns then on, syncs with each other and your phone.I highly recommend this product for it's quality, battery life, quick syncing/on-off features, and small form factor.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
These are absolutely great earbuds ... I use there for music from my iPod (don't use them for phone so I can't address this aspect).  I love the touch controls as well as the voice prompts.

My Apple Airpod Pros that were given to me as a gift were stolen.  I decided to replace them with something less expensive and I am not a real audiophile.  I am more than satisfied with the Tozo T6's that I chose because they were an Amazon's Choice.  I can tell no difference in the sound between the Apple and Tozo and the T6's actually fit my ears better.  They synced with my iPhone and iPad immediately and work perfectly and they one quarter of the price of the Airpod Pros.,5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0

"The touch sensitivity on these is WAY too high. My hair hits it and triggers it. The idea that you can shower with them is downright laughable because the shower water hitting them triggers pauses, reverses, and volume changes like crazy.They are pretty good other than that, and the carrying case is well designed, but it must be only men reviewing this who don't need to get their head wet in the shower.",3,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0
"This is my first experience with these types of earbuds, I usually have an over the ear headphones but as a person living in the desert - it gets extremely sweaty when outside. The sound is amazing, no complaints, very comfortable as I often forget I'm wearing them. I have no cons about this product, I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends. The carrying case is very slick and looks nice, I love how it charges the earbuds inside the case - and it supports wireless charging.Edit: well, at first glance these ear buds were good however for me as soon as I put them in my pocket and started moving they would cut in and out constantly as I was listening to music. No matter what I did did not alleviate the situation I'm giving this a one-star and returning them and I will never buy or recommend this product to anyone. if you plan on just sitting down in one position and listen to music then by these if you want to walk around or anything outside do not think about buying these.",1,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"These are great earbuds. The sound is clear throughout the music range including the bass.  You can’t expect booming bass from any earbud, but these provide enough to make your listening experience really nice.

I really like that the case has extra charge capacity to recharge them. I am extremely pleased with this set.",5,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0

The black earbuds had a 20% off coupon when I purchased them.",5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"sounds awesome, great quality, and for the money it’s an amazing value. Not active noise canceling but you don’t need it based on the design. I had the Apple AirPod Pros and I wanted to love them but they would not stay in my ear and for the money I couldn’t see keeping them for $300+ with tax and apple care. These actually sound way better and the noise canceling on the AirPods was dismal at best. these do a better job noise canceling inherently based on design.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"I probably should have returned these right away.  The mechanical engineering is excellent, nice case, magnetically snap into place easily.  However, they disconnect constantly.  It seldom gets through an entire song without disconnecting multiple times.  The phone has not moved and neither has the earphone.It is too bad, because the sound is good and the feel is good, but if it doesn't connect it is worthless.",1,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"I've ordered 2 sets of these headphones (one for me and one for the girlfriend) and i love them. The sound is immersive and the noise cancelling is awesome. The earbuds are easy to connect and user friendly. The touch is nice but can sometimes be affected by sweat if you sweat a lot. It tends to register as a touch and occasionally pause my music or turn the volume up or down. I have had some troubles with both sets needing to be replaced due to one of the earbuds having stopped charging BUT i contacted customer service and they were easy to deal with and absolutely spot on. When the troubleshooting didnt solve the issue they sent new sets to us.

"I was in the market for a set of wireless earbuds that weren’t overpriced. I wanted something that offered similar specs to the airpods like having gesture controls, great battery life and a strong bluetooth connection. I like that unlike airpods these bad boys came with bluetooth 5 so the connection is really strong. They come with different eartips because let’s face it...we all don’t have the same ear sizes. Overall the main reason I chose to buy these over a replacement pair of airpods that were 80 dollars for a repair is because of the fact that they’re waterproof like most people i take my earbuds everywhere including to the gym or to run and naturally i sweat and my right airpod stopped working all together because of sweat over time gross i know but honestly don’t second guess them.

Good bass and excellent noise cancellation. I find it very helpful that alll of the MFB actions are confirmed by automated voice confirmation. For example, when you tap the right MFB 2x you will hear “forward” to confirm you have advanced tracks on your play list. And with 2x tap on the left MFB will hear “reverse” to confirm move to the previous track on your play list.  A great pair of wireless earbuds.

Sound quality for music is very good, although obviously not as good as over-the-ear headphones, and much better than older earbuds I've owned. Battery life is phenomenal, I can use them all day without worry. I had originally been unsure about the size of the case, but it is not very big at all and fits comfortably next to my wallet. The case is also wireless charging capable which is a great plus. The entire package was very solid and professional. Multiple sizes of ear pieces delivered alongside clear instructions. Earbuds sit nice and low profile inside the ear, waterproofing is good so far but I haven't exactly thrown them in a pond yet.

I have no worries about them getting wet.However, you can't depend on them for swimming or for in the shower.

I honestly don't know how I lived without these before now they have changed my life! The truth of it is that if you want some buds that are on par if not better than the big name brand buds then these are your go-to and should be your one and only set from now on. The biggest changer in my life because of these my daughter's life is so much better she is 10 years old and a wonderful girl but she was sadly born blind we have looked all over for headphones that are clear and crisp and no other brand seemed to do it like these did, now she can enjoy her audiobooks with crisp clear sound.

They are sleek and look really cool. You can also talk on the phone with them, one time me and my boyfriend each used one bud to talk to my sister and it worked great!

"After using wired earbuds forever, finally got tired of a tangled ball of a cord and being tathered to a phone.  Searched around and decided on Tozo T6.  I thought wireless earbuds are pricey, but was surprised to see this is affordable.  I've been using it everyday for 3-4 weeks to attend webinars, listen to music while walking dogs, catch up with friends/families during quarantine. I like the sound quality, its compact size, and the magnetic charging case.  Like the feel of snappy magnetic fit when earbuds are inserted into the case.  It came with different size fittings but ended up using the set that came with it. The battery life seems to be long - I think I charged the case only a couple of times so far. Only minor thing to improve would be an easier way to tell R or L.  My old eyes can't really see a very tiny marking (literally a grain of sand size) - perhaps a color band/mark on one of the ear pieces would be nice.  Overally, I am glad I chose Tozo T6 and recommed it to others.",5,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
I've tried a few buds in the $50 range and these are the ones that work for me.  The phone call quality is good on both ends which is my primary concern. Having a touch sensitive control button is a huge plus.  Not comfortable pushing a bud into your ear with a click style button.  It switches over seamlessly when connecting during a call.  Noise cancelation could be better but is decent.  Stays put well if you use the correct size ear piece.  Sound quality for music is good.  Overall very happy with this bud.,5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"The sound quality is good and the mic transmit voice very well, so far I haven't heard had any complaints with my voice clarity when I'm using this for my voice calls. However, the battery life is not as good as listed in description. On a full charge the earphones last about 3 to 4 hours however the case only holds charge for at the most 3 recharges for fully discharged earphones.",4,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"At 1/5 the cost of the name brand earbuds these are an excellent buy. I use them to listen to audio books, movies and YouTube videos and I find the audio quality to be excellent. Recharge time has never been an issue and overall I am very happy with this purchase and  I think you will be also.",5,1,2020-6-4,1,1,0
"I chose these ear buds because they checked the most boxes in my list.  I needed a pair of cordless headphones for long duration phone calls that could also double for my music headphones at the gym.  These do just that.  I came from an LG headset (around the neck style) that was fantastic for talking on, in fact I used it daily for years before it gave out on me.  This product is not that, the sound quality on my end is almost identical but the person on the other end cannot hear me as clearly ONLY when I talk low and or whisper.  Normal speaking voice is heard perfectly on the other end, even when driving in a noisy car.  The ear buds have great sound quality, albeit not the best out there but a great deal better than other wireless ear buds.  All in all my experience has been short of amazing.  The only downside is that I am unable to whisper as I was before.  I think this is due to my around the neck style headset had the mic closer to my mouth and has nothing to do with the product itself.  I also love the fact that I can use my right bud until the batter gets low, around 5-6 hours of straight talk time, and then switch to my left and place the right in the case (which charges it!!!) without ever touching anything or dropping the call.  I will definitely be buying this product again for the simple fact that I get so many hours of talk time on a single charge. (5 hours per bud, 15 hours of charge held in the case)",5,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"After having tried ear buds that fall and sound quality is not so great, I'm really enjoying these buds. I love the sound quality the most and most of all I love that I can charge wirelessly.These are great since I like to listen to music and watch YouTube with great sound. Awesome travel buds and much better priced then high dollar buds that are not as good.",5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,1
"These sound better than my kids Airpods! Couldn't get through my workouts without them! Very rarely I have some trouble with the bluetooth pairing, but I attribute that more to my phone than the earbuds.Had an issue with the right earbud on one of the sets I purchased. Followed the guide from the Tozo website to update the firmware - worked great on one set, only updated left earbud on the faulty set. I contacted Tozo support and they were great to work with and responsive, and are sending me a replacement for the faulty right earbud.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
"I ordered two sets of these for me and my wife. They work great with my Android phone and with her iPhone. We've primarily used them for the gym, and they're great for that; no problems with sweating or heavy movement.On one of the sets, the right earbud stopped working. I followed the online guide to try a firmware update which worked for the working left earbud, but didn't for the right. I contacted Tozo support and they were responsive and handled the situation and are sending a replacement earbud.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"I purchased these earbuds after returning a pair of Apple Airpods and being very unhappy, although I am an Android user and didn't expect a seamless experience.  I've used the T6's for a handful of workouts now and couldn't be happier. They arrived faster than expected and performance has been steller. The 3 different options of rubber inserts are great for getting the perfect fit. Sound has been great, good bass, and the tight fit provides excellent noise cancellation while using the treadmill. Touch controls are sensitive but easy to use, and I've had no issues with battery life. I've also had zero disconnects, music interruptions and range is good. The wireless charging of the case is definitely convenient as I haven't had to use a cable to charge the case yet. For the $100 I saved over the Airpods I returned, these are a steal. I would recommend them to anyone.",5,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0

They are step up from my old wired/wireless earphones!",5,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"I'm very happy with the quality of these ear buds. Vocals are really clear and base is decent and doesn't distort at high volume.  They fit very comfortably in my ears and I haven't had any issues with them falling out. The battery life is strong,I use them every day and I don't have to charge them too often.  Having the option to charge wirelessly and wired is really convenient.  In all I'm very happy with the product.",4,1,2020-3-26,1,0,0
"I like the multiple sizes of rubber pieces that can be changed out to get the best fit. I struggle with finding just the right fit for my ears and i can get it just right with these! I have had my ear buds suddenly shut themselves off or disconnect randomly, but it is few and far between for how often I use these. Occasionally they will also have a lag between the buds themselves, I'll hear in the L before the R or vice versa. That's why the 4 stars. Otherwise, great product.",4,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"For the price these are great ! I listen to EDM music that has heavy bass & the sound is more clear them my phone earbuds 😊 Easy to set up & use. I love that I don't need to touch my phone to answer calls, change volume , skip to the next song or use google assistant. Also this set work using just one ear bud & each have a mic, so it's great for making calls too. Comes with multiple ear bud sizes.  Very happy with my purchase 😍",5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,1
"My wife bought these for me for my birthday in February and I can honestly say that I have been very pleased! The sound quality is superb and they are great for every day use. I am a mailman and use them for my daily routes. I did have an issue with the right ear bud having a sound malfunction. After trying all of the trouble shooting suggestions that were in the user manual, I contacted the company. They promptly responded and told me they would send me a replacement right ear bud. Excellent service and product! I could not be happier with them!",5,1,2020-3-25,1,0,0

I have been using the TOZO T6 for more than a month now. I mostly use them for meetings and sometimes for music. Here is what I have founda) It is a well designed product.,3,1,2020-9-29,1,1,0
"They were easily paired right out of the box. Sounds quality is good, music quality is on par with price range. Distance could be better but not so much that I wouldn't purchase them. Fitting of the buds are OK but takes a bit to find the right fit for them to stay in snug. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to purchase. At this price range for this type of quality, you can't go wrong :)",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"The sound quality is great and it cancels out noise quite well. Happy with this purchase overall and the waterproof rating makes it super easy to clean and maintain these in good condition. The different sizes provided with packagin are convenient and I prefer to use the wireless charging over wired because of convenience. They last long enough to wear without losing charge in a session. Usually lasts about 6hrs in ears, I've lost charge couple times because i wear these long hours while studying. Filters out even a lawn mower, super useful in keeping my concentration. I wear these in the gym and while running too, pretty great. Overall, happy with this purchase; the product is visually appealling and the quality is nice, especially for the low price tag.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
These little earbuds are fabulous. I have small ears and ear canals and have had trouble finding comfortable wireless earbuds. These fit so snugly I can run with them without worrying about them falling out. Sound is great and I really like the light touch activated features. They look slick without buttons or markings on the surface. They charge quickly even from the unconnected charged carrying case. I highly recommend these ear buds!,5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"So I have three different pairs of EarPods. The Toso T6, anker liberty air 2pods and the Apple AirPods. In my opinion these by far have the best sound and the deepest bass out of all three.  They don’t fall out of my ear like the apples do all the time and the microphone easily picks up when I ask Siri for assistance. These are the best price and the best sounding out of all three so save yourself the headache and just get these",5,1,2020-6-3,1,1,0
"I have had these wireless earbuds in my cart for quite a while now but I have put off buying them.  When I noticed the price had been reduced dramatically for Black Friday I decided it was time to give them a try, and I'm sooo glad I did!  I love these!  My daughter has the Airpods 2 wireless earbuds and I've listed to them and they do sound great but I did not want to pay that much.  The TOZO T6 are a great substitute, they have great sound quality and I like how these actually fit in your ear instead of just sit outside of it.  It sounds almost as good as the $200 Airpods and cost a fourth of the price!  If you are on the fence....get off and buy these, you won't regret it!",5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"Overall I like these headphones for the battery life is better than most.  Hate to go to the gym and having to wait for earbuds to charge after a long workout like my other pair is not ideal.  These are perfect for my training sessions.  I did deduct a star due to the silicone tips for they do not completely isolate the outside noise.  I switched the tips out with foam ones and a huge difference in sound quality, fit and background noise.  Doing that brings these up to a five star item.",4,1,2019-11-30,1,1,0
"I thought they would be too big for my ears and I was questioning if pink would be the right color. The pink is beautiful, not too bold & they fit wonderfully in my ears. My first impression of the sound was pleased. I like that I can switch between my left and right ear for listening and it's easy to control.  It's nice to be able to rewind and fast forward without having to pick up my phone. Also, I'm satisfied with the extended warranty for only $5. Hopefully I won't need it but in case I do I won't have to buy a new pair. I will likely update my review after trying them a little more but so far I'm very please with the sound quality, the fit, and the color.",5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"We were looking at getting the Apple AirPods, but couldn't justify the high price.  We came across these and figured we'd give them a shot.  For the price, you really can't beat them.  The build quality, look, and feel of them is very good.  They fit well and the sound quality is very good.  I use them mostly when mowing the yard and am very impressed with them.  If you're on the fence about which Bluetooth earbuds to get you should definitely try these first!  I will revisit this review after I have spent a little more time with them.",5,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
"AirPods don't work for me, so I decided to see what the Amazon community prefers...these topped the list so I ordered the T6 package and hoped for something that would work out. I am impressed! Pairing was a snap. Audio quality of music was great with both earbuds in. The mic quality is pretty good for calls. My test callers reported that they could hear me well with little background noise. The T6 seems compatible with the apps I use. Like!",4,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"I have had these earbuds for less than a week and am very satisfied with my purchase. I have ordered 2 other pairs of earbuds and the sound quality and battery life do not compare to these.  I also love the size of the case.  It's small and easy to open.  The earbuds fit well, but the touch commands are more sensitive that I'd like.  Work well, but maybe too well sometimes.  Pairing is simple and quick.  I am able to move around my house mostly without losing connection which I did not anticipate.  These are a great value and I have not been disappointed.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a budget friendly pair of wireless blue tooth earbuds with surprising sound quality.",4,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"I bought these less than 6 months ago, and they will Not hold a charge!! It’s very frustrating. I charge them to full and they don’t even last a full gym session. It was a huge waste of money. The sound is great, but there’s no point if the battery doesn’t last long enough to enjoy them.",1,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0
"I wanted to love this headset but it fell a little short for me. First lets start with the good. Build quality and finish is very nice, audio quality is clear with lots of bass and battery life seems very good as I haven't had to charge the case in a few daysWhat needs improvement is the Mic, whenever am on a phone call the other persons keeps complaining about loud background noise almost to the point i have to take one earbud out my ears to speak into it like a mike which helps a little bit. Another issue is that the design is so sleek that it can be challenging to take the earbud out the case especially the first one as there is not much room or are to grab a hold of to pull it out.  Last issue which is the biggest concern for me is the volume as its low compared to every other headset I have used whether wireless or not, the volume seems to be about 70-80% of what am used to and the main reason i bought this is for the gym and it can be annoying especially whenever youre listening to something that may already be low in volume so you cant increase it by much. I really do like it and hope they improve on these or i could just receive a defective device but that's my experience so far.",4,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
I started to use these T6 earbuds for a week now. I used it to listen to audiobook during sleep. The battery lasts for about 4 hrs after I put it to charge when I woke up. I tried to use it to make an overseas call. And it was very clear. My friend on the other end said it was clear and good too. I used the small cover for earbud and it fits good. I usually use the small cover for other earbud too. It does say reverse on the earbud when you put on the wrong side earbud. I am happy with my purchase and hope it lasts.,5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
I got these for Christmas and have been nothing but surprised.  I have been wanting a pair of earbuds for a long time but didn’t want to pay for the expensive ones. After a lot of research I decided I would give these a try. First off they fit in my ears perfectly. I wasn’t used to the feeling of earbuds in my ears without a cord so I kept thinking they were going to fall out. After using them for a few days I realized that nothing I did caused them to fall out. I got so used to them that I didn’t even notice they were in. Other earbuds have caused me ear pain after extended use but not these ones. I thought I might have to try the different sized tips that came with them but the default ones are perfect for my ears. Secondly they paired very easily. I have had no issue going back and forth between my iPad and iPhone. I was a little worried that it might have some trouble but they paired the first time and I have yet to have them disconnect by themselves. Thirdly the sound quality is way better than I expected. I thought that for a fraction of the price of the more well known brands I might be disappointed in the sound quality. These things sound amazing. Whether it’s listening to music or watching a movie I couldn’t be happier with my decision to go with these earbuds.,5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,1
"Great headphones overall. Great for the price, easy to pair. I can hear my phone calls nice and clearly. My only complaint is I can’t use them with Siri. For me it is a problem because I need to be as hands free as possible when it comes to my phone. The touch is very sensitive but once you get used to it doesn’t bother anymore. They come with different rubber pieces so finding a fit should be easy.",4,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
"Overall, I was quite impressed with these earphones. The form factor of the buds themselves is quite nice and they fit quite well. It was slightly confusing at first when I put them on and tried them but I read the manual and was good to go (I was trying to wear them upside down). Pairing is quick and the earphones remember the last device they were connected to.Sound quality:",5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"Overall not a bad set for the office or someplace like that. The Bluetooth phone mode is not bad but not great either. They are not really “noise cancelling” but have good sound quality. The battery life for office days is 2-4 depending on features used (music vs phone calls) and overall not a bad set for $50. The one big draw back that bumped it down a star, is the fact they are not a good set for exercising or activities. Especially when sweating they fall out. I’d buy again but not for exercise or activities, rather for office or study type applications.",4,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"I bought some T10s first and noticed the T6s were the upgraded version. I then purchased them the next day and did a side by side comparison. The T6s were close in sound quality, but The T10s edged them out. And for the volume?? I was able to get a louder volume from the the 10s. The only advantage I could visibly see with the T6s?? Is they are a bit smaller and claim to have better battery life....which I cant confirm or deny because I didnt have them long enough to run power down. They are sitting here boxed up waiting for UPS.",3,1,2020-1-11,1,1,0
"Ok so I normally go all out and buy Bose or beats because we all expect it to have the best sound known to mankind right? Well I have now gone through two sets of Bose wireless which DID last about 6-7 years in total between the two... and two sets of beats headphones which the studio 3’s lasted 3 years and the solo 3’s lasted like a year...I use them to work out so they get used a lot...I bought these to give another company a chance, and omg the sound is clean and base is very decent too! I read reviews from others that the noise cancellation is bad? Ok first of all it’s not as great as Bose but pretty close to beats. Honestly I expected this to be ok but now I feel like I disrespected the company...so my bad.. I’m very impressed. Also the controls on the sensors is brilliant! I had my Bose loving brother try them and he was very impressed with the sensor touch part, we are both surprised Bose didn’t do the same! This review is aimed at all the ppl who are scared to drop the money on this product, like I was... give them a chance, I’m happy I did. Now I hope they endure my workouts just fine too!",5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,1
"Overall great set of buds for the price.  The battery life is plenty for me.  I use one at a time so really I have double the life doing it that way but I don't even need to use the other one.  I listen to a lot of podcasts and youtube videos on it and love the quality.  Only complains is the touch is sensitive so you have to be careful when taking them out of your ears, otherwise the touch works great.PS used them in the shower a couple times without any issues.",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
I ultimately had to return these despite the fact that the sound quality and fit were pretty good. My issue was that they would start playing randomly when not in my ears making me lose my place in the audiobook I was listening to. I couldn't find a way to keep this from happening except for unpairing them every time they weren't in use so they went back to Amazon.,3,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"I tried all of the ear tips and none of them were able to keep the units in place. They are top-heavy so would fall out easily. Also, any time I tried to put them in I would inadvertently press the buttons which would advance the track. I mostly listen to audio books so this was pretty annoying. That said, the sound quality was decent and they were easy to pair with my iPhone 7.",2,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"Received these earbuds on Time! I was very surprised by the clarity and sound that they produced. Also very easy synchronizing with blue tooth. I am a little disappointed with the bass.

Was actually going to buy the AKGs, but was impressed by the overall reviews on line.",4,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"Awesome. Buy these they are great. Right out of box no problems. I use them to listen to music at work and going to the gym. Today I had to snowblower drive and they were great. I didn’t have to crank the volume, just used normal volume. Could hardly hear someblower. I had to take one out because when I started the car I couldn’t tell if the motor was running.Can’t wait till summer so I can use them when I mow the grass.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"The sound quality is great, but I don’t like how sensitive the touch feature is. I am constantly changing songs or messing up whatever I’m listening to because these react to even the slightest touch.I love the case they are in, by the way.

They are not bad but they are not good to workout with. They are very sensitive when you touch them while in ear the commands change.Update: The company reached put to me and informed me that pair could be defective. So they sent out new pair.

"These are surprisingly very nice earbuds. Build quality seems to be good. The sound and noise cancelation is what really surprised me. Nice bass, mids, and lows. Came with 3 pairs of different size earbuds to get a better fit. I cannot comment on battery life yet. The previous years model T10 had a button to skip/forward track and to answer calls. This one is touch, and honestly I don't care for it. The response is quick, but if I need to take a earbud out 9/10 times I end up pausing or skip/forward a song. Being a bit critical, if I could dock a half star I would. All and all a great buy so far.",4,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0

"I was looking for a wireless headphone to use for work. I bought one product in store and returned the next day bec it was hard to connect, sound was not good and no volume control. As i was browsing amazon i came across many products but the best review was on T6. So i took a chance.It came with a small charging case. Tried the earbuds and fits me well. It connected easily with my phone thru bluetooth. I Like the touch feature. I listened to my music playlist for a few minutes  and the sound was great. I was almost satisfied but disappointed when  I used it the following day, the music was garbled and intermittently lost the sound. Not sure if its bec i left my phone in the bedroom and i went downstairs to the kitchen.  So i had to reset and made sure my phone is near me.  Price is reasonable.  Battery life is probably as stated. Over all is a good buy and comfortable to the ear so i still gave 4 stars.",4,1,2019-10-28,1,0,1
"They are good. At first I couldnt get anything to play. That might just be my phone. But got it to work. Also the charger is just a cable that is like 4 inches long, no charging base wall plug. So you need to use a USB from a computer or some other device, unless you have a extra charging base. The product is very nice overall with the touch commands, but they do feel to big/heavy, will be trying different silicon plugs. Overall still really good product. Do recommend.",4,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"These work much better than other wireless earbuds that I've had in the past. There is little to no lag when watching TV with them and the wireless charging case is a big plus. The range is very good compared to others as well. I could walk upstairs, a good 30 meters with no line of sight and still had good quality.Only con is that when using with my TV, the volume isn't as loud as with my over-the-ears headset. Not sure if that is a TV issue or an issue with the earbuds.",4,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0

"These work just as advertised.  Pretty good sound quality in phone calls and in music.  I use them for running and my work outs get pretty sweaty.  This causes me to need to readjust them and that is tricky since they are touch sensitive.  The battery life is a bit shorter than expected but they do make it through 1 and 2 hour workouts just fine.  For the money, they seem to be the prefect selection.",5,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0

"These just arrived. Opening the package, the earbuds had a solid design feel. You often can feel if something is cheaply made just by touching it. These had a very well manufactured feel to them.They paired incredibly easy. They also came with a wide variety of ear pieces to adjust for the size of your ear. They are arranged on a small plastic frame and snap in place to hold them. I have never seen this before. Instead of a small plastic bag with all the pieces mixed up and you have to search for the matching pair, all the replacement ear pieces are arranged nice and orderly for easy switching out.",5,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"I love these earbud! I had tozot10 version and they were amazing as well but I found it a little time consuming to manually connecting the earbud. Although I'm not sure if my review will be super helpful since I've only had these for a few hours. Though I will note how these are different from previous models. For one the charging case is significantly smaller than the t10s. It was annoying how that case much of my pocket space. Another thing is once you pair your phone and the buds, once you take them out again they pair on their own! No doing it yourself. One more thing to note is that it's a little quieter than the t10s but that doesn't mean the sound quality is horrible. All in all would recommend this to anyone looking for new wireless earbuds",5,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"Tozo T6 earbuds sound really good. If you are person who like heavy bass, this product is for you. The best advantage of having them is the battery, its last really long and the case can charge upto 4-5 times. Plus, the case can seamlessly on a wireless charging pad which you don’t get to see in many other expensive earbuds. Other advantage you have is smart touch, works really good. They come with 3 pairs of extra ear tips that helps you find the best fit to have a great sound experience and noise reduction.I would say, you don’t need to spend hundreds of bucks to find great sounding earbuds, just get Tozo T6 for $45 that will give you all the comfort and features you would get in an expensive pair of buds.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,1
Amazing clarity. My previous ear bud was connected by wire and was constantly jiggling around as I used the elliptical for exercising.  These ear buds are so convenient in all aspects.  Storage and charging were well engineered.  I close my eyes when I exercise and listen to the music. The sound is even better and it sounds like the music is coming out of the middle of my forehead (third eye).,5,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"These little devices are amazing. Extremely portable and lite. They stay put really well, which is a huge plus as they don’t fall out when I move around. The sound quality is great - I’m amazed at how the bass sounds so good in something so small. Battery life is good for the size. I had a pair of earbuds with little stems (sound Liberty 25 maybe?) that had even better battery life, but not as compact and light. The others are going to my sibling, I will be using these going forward. These are super comfortable, even after a couple of hours!Setup was a breeze, which is always a relief with Bluetooth products. The case is really neat!",5,1,2019-10-29,1,0,1

I did not get any discount or free set for this review but when the time comes to get another one this will the one I get again. As of right now I have NO complaints.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"I love these ear buds! I had bought 2 for my son, son-n-law and husband. My husband uses them for snowboarding and they stay in and stay connected.... constant use they lasted him from 9-2.... he forgot to bring charging case up on the mountain or it would be a quick charge and back in after lunch. Can’t beat the price and a year warranty. So far, I love them as well. Nice that they are water resistant as well.",5,1,2020-2-29,1,0,1
"I got these based on the amazing good reviews and I decided to give them a try. I absolutely love them. The sound quality is good, the battery never runs out and I'm using them multiple hours a day and the best feature is that they are water-resistant which gives me the freedom to swim and do aqua fitness with them.Yes, I would recommend them and buy them again.",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"These are amazing! After seeing all of the good reviews for the previous model I decided to purchase these as a Christmas gift for my roommate and she absolutely loves them! I have Bose earbuds and SOL republic headphones and these sound better than them both, not to mention they are way cheaper! The sound quality is amazing  and can handle a wide variety of music styles. I needed to find something that had good bass and these really impressed me! These are some quality earbuds and I recommend them to anyone!",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0

"I got these today and was happy but slightly disappointed.  The sound was not as good as a cheaper pair of Bluetooth headphones I own.  Those had a wire between the two earbuds, but I wanted something more convenient.  So, I bought these.  These paired quickly, and the case and ear buds feels like good quality.  My main complaint is that there is no bass.  The mids and highs sound fine, but there is no punch.  Other than that, they are great.",4,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"the earbuds were comfortable, and the controls were easy to use (press either side once to play/pause, press and hold left/right to lower/raise volume, press left/right twice to go to previous/next track). there are plenty of ear tips so you should be able to find a size that works for you. i'm not an audiophile, so i can't comment on the sound quality. the sound quality is better than any wired earbuds i've ever used, though. i never called anyone with them, so i don't know how calls sound or how i sound to others.unfortunately, the right side started failing less than a month after i started using them. they were noticeably quieter than the left, especially when i was listening to them in low volume. i tried charging them all the way, factory resetting, and even cleaned my ears (lol), but nothing helped.",3,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"The worst ear buds I've bought. I purchased soundpeats before and they are decent. The Mic quit working after a year of use but the sound quality isn't comparable to these. These don't fit my ear, noise cancellation is terrible, volume is horrible, the battery life is terrible. These kept showing up on Amazon as better than soundpeats. I'm going back to them.",1,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"I love these! A friend has them and recommend them to me and I cannot say enough good things! I have small ears and I VERY much appreciate the different sizes so these can actually stay in my ear! Whether it’s working at my desk, the treadmill at the gym, doing PiYo, or riding my bike on the trails these stay in! I find myself taking one out during phone calls because I cannot hear anything else with these in! Which I love!When I want to jam out at my desk and not hear the office chatter or just work out and get in the zone these are perfect! Not to mention they don’t slip when I get sweaty!",5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
"Update. Decided to take these to work and use a TP—Link BT 4 adapter. They are working very well. I have used another set of tips that have made these fit well. Sound is good for background music and webinars. For work, I would recommend these (no movies or quality music). Have changed stars from 2 to 4 because of the price point.These are highly recommended over the Tao Tronics buds.",4,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0
"I purchased these for my sister for Christmas. These are amazing!  Such a great buy! I'm glad I chose these over the IPhone ones. Honestly, I was afraid she'd lose one or both.  It is my opinion from these and the IPhone air pods that my nephew has that the sound quality is better, especially phone calls. I can hear her so clear. If you want a less expensive option, you canNOT go wrong with these!  Shoot, I want some for myself now.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"Sound quality is good. Comes with 4 sizes so better to fit the ear. Bass is low but I listen to rock so don't need a lot. Touch controls work well, can interchange and they know which ear is which.My only gripe is the case. It's hard to get them out. The ear pieces are smooth so gripping them slide and lid only goes up so it's hard to get behind to grip them.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"There are a couple odd things about these earbuds, but overall they're pretty good. Firstly, I don't think that these earbuds are *actually* IPx8 water resistant as there's no documentation of that. I had the case in my pocket while my pants were soaking wet and the earbuds still worked, but that's as far as I want to test them. The earbuds appear to have some form of seal around the actual speaker.The audio is pretty good, especially for fully wireless earbuds that cost less than $50.",5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
"I have both the T10 and the T6 earbuds.  Both earbuds are really quite good sounding. Compared to other earbuds I have used both wired and wireless, the TOZO earbuds great sound range.  I have the TOZO wireless charging pad too. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FLVNCYN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.  It works nice with the earbud cases (and my phones too).T6 Pros",4,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
"What I liked most about these earbuds was the sound quality. Once I found the right fitting ear grips (they sent 6 different sizes), the base and over all quality was amazing.  I would often only use one at a time because of work, but when I had both in, I felt like I was using my high quality wired headphones. They were very comfortable in my ear, and the finger touch controls were easy to get used to. Also, I like the fact that you can adjust the volume right from your earbuds. I also really appreciated the customer service. If I had any issues or questions they were able to respond by the next day. Over all, these are awesome earbuds and you can't beat them for under $50 bucks.",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"I’ve had these earbuds for about two and a half months and this morning my battery lasted only 1 hour despite being in the case for the last two days.  Very disappointing.Also, I find the design isn’t very good.  They are top-weighted and I am constantly having to readjust them to keep them from falling out.  It may be my small ears or it may be a bad design.",2,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0
"I was searching for a product just like this one. It's a slim profile so I hardly notice it in my pocket. It's the same size as an apple airpod case. In addition, there is hardly any delay and they dont fall out of my ear like airpods do. I like that it also wirelessly charges, so I can just set it on a qi pad and grab it when I'm ready to go. Overall, it's the best ear buds for the money I think. It puts rival earbuds that cost 5x as much to shame.",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
These do not stay in my ears well at all even after changing the rubber piece. If you sweat at all they will slide out. Also sweat will block the sound completely. Super distracting trying to keep them in. Connecting is a bit of a pain in the ass too. My fault for trying to not pay for AirPods. I’ve had these for just over 2 months. I use them 3-4 times a week strictly when working out. I wish I could return them but the window has closed. I purchased because of the tremendous amount of positive reviews.,1,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"After using the T6 for two days I really enjoy them. They fit well, sound good and are very light weight. They stay in while running. I do wish the volume went up a bit higher. I only have a problem when mowing my lawn with the volume not going high enough. but I am kinda def. Also the controls are very touchy but I am getting used to it. Over all I would definitely recommend these over the major name brands. They work as good yet way cheaper.",4,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"I've looked at wireless earbuds for a while and just haven't wanted to spend almost 100 or over 100 dollars on a pair, I was so ready to get these and only be mildly pleased with them, but boy was I wrong. These are amazing, the noise cancelation is so good and so is the sound quality. The battery life is great, and there are clear indicator lights for charging/charged. It comes with so many different sized buds there has to be one that's comfortable for you. The touch control is nice and easy to use. Needless to say I am thrilled at how nice these are for such a low price, I love these.",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,1
"I was replacing GoNovate Airo earbuds with these tozo T6 earbuds and they are not bad, I am very pleased. They stay snug in my ear how I put them. The sound is a bit better than the novates. The touch command buttons are extremely sensitive to the touch which takes getting used to. The magnetic case is very strong so much that it's a bit hard getting them out but that's a good thing they aren't going to go flying when I accidentally drop them which I have done many times with my GoNovate earbuds...so far I very much like these especially because they had them in pink :)",5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"Overall I’ve only had the earbuds for a few hours, but I’m satisfied. They’re good quality for the price. I’d even say the sound quality is better than Airpods (I’ve never owned any but I’ve tested out my friend’s pair). I have very small ears, but they fit quite well. I don’t really like how they stick out but it’s far better than some other wireless earbuds I’ve seen. I don’t usually work out so I’m not sure how they fair against lots of movement and sweat. The only problem is that if you use these and want to lay on your side say on the beach or in bed the touch sensors will think you’re pressing the controls so you’d have to be careful about that. Hopefully these earbuds hold up for a long time.",4,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"I just converted from the Samsung word to iPhone with the 11 and my wired 3.5mm earbuds no longer worked. So, I thought I'd give Bluetooth ones a try.I use Comply isolation ear bud tips (T400s, for those of you who want to know which size); I am very happy with the noise cancellation, but it might be the tips I use. The sound quality is outstanding, the battery life takes me through most of the day, and the weight of them in my ears is not bothersome. After about four or five hours I need to take a break, but after 45 minutes or so, I'm good to go again for another several hours.",5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"Do NOT buy these for working out. It’s actually really sad because as most people have said, they are pretty great. BUT, only if you don’t put your hands or other things anywhere near your face. When I wear them to exercise, if I use my hand towel on my head or touch my hair or wipe sweat off, the music stops. The touch control is waaaaay too sensitive most of the time and then doesn’t work at all other times. If my towel even passes near my ear, something unintended happens. Usually the music stops, so frustrating! Sound good, good battery life, etc. but not usable for workouts.",2,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0
"I highly recommend purchasing these. The sound is great and I am heard clearly by others when using these. Being heard clearly was my biggest concern. I didn't see many comments about being heard when I read reviews, so I want to make sure people see this so they know they can be heard clearly and without problems. I am very impressed and would highly recommend!",5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
"Just like the T10s, the T6 are easy to pair and sound quite balanced, with decent bass and treble (provided that you achieve air-tight seal for which you have 4 different size options). The carrying case is extremely convenient - small, provides 3-4 charges and can even be charged wireless. Unlike the T10s, these have touch controls - which is quite a useful feature when you don't accidentally activate it (ie, when trying to adjust the buds' position). In terms of size they are slightly smaller, which make them even more comfortable to wear.",5,1,2019-10-11,1,0,0
I found the sound quality to be very good. There are many options for selection of different size earpieces with varying amounts of sound isolation quality. I like the size of them and how they fit very close to the ear. The product came with a 1 year manufacturer warranty as well. I was having some issue with the charging and was very pleased that TOZO customer service sent a reply to my inquiry within 1 day with suggestions on how to resolve the issue. I found that the contacts occasionally need to be cleaned to insure successful charging. I also found that if the charging case is plugged in when the earbuds are inserted they do no appear to begin to charge as no lights illuminate. It is necessary to unplug the charging case and let the earbuds charge utilizing the battery in the charging case or simply plug the charging case back in.,5,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"I have to confess, I wanted the Apple AirPods Pro, but at $250 that just wasn't going to happen, and I'm happy to say I'm glad I got these instead. After comparing the sound quality of these to a friend's Apple AirPods Pro earbuds, I really couldn't tell the difference, and these were much, much more comfortable. I've yet to run out of a charge, even without using the case, and the wireless charging is a big plus. So far I'm loving these, and at less than $50 I'm already thinking of buying more as gifts.",5,1,2020-3-12,1,0,1
"Sound quality is not quite as good as a Bose product, but still quite good on it’s own.  Comes with 4 sizes of cushions for the ear buds to customize the fit in your ear.  The case has capability to recharge these ear buds for 3 or 4 charges, which is quite handy.  Really great deal for the price, and work well so far.  Have only had these for 2 months, so cannot yet comment on longevity, but so far, so good.",5,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"So far, they connect quickly to my laptop or phone. I can use just one earbud at a time. They have different size earbud pieces to fit it best to my ear - which I have used! I'm really pleased so far! :)UPDATE: Less than a week later... Randomly the earbuds will not have clear sound come through, it's almost like static or crackling. I'm not sure if the battery life is very long because I've had to charge them twice already. I do use them for 8 hour days of work, but they don't seem to last a full day. They are not consistently working perfectly, which is disappointing.",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"These are some great truly wireless headphones. They sound great, feel good (the different replaceable tips REALLY help in that respect) and I really like the touch controls, even if they are a little too easy to activate. In fact, my one compliant would be just that, especially when trying to put them in. However, after playing around with them for just a couple minutes let me get used to getting them in without hitting the controls. All in all, I'd say this set of headphones is well worth the $50.",5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"Super buy! My teen daughter has lost her AirPods twice now, and I suggested maybe trying something that didn’t cost an arm and leg. She’s happy with these!

"I've had headphones that sound better, but I also paid 200+ dollars for them. The sound quality is great, the lows are low and the highs are high. Surprised at the bass quality honestly especially given the price. I was worried because I kept seeing people say you can't control volume etc but I guess they didn't glance at the user manual? You can control volume by touching and holding either left or right, you can pause by touching and letting go, and you can skip forwards or backwards by double clicking on either left or right. Simple stuff.",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"So maybe I'm not an audiophile nut, but I do know what sounds good to me. These buds fit well and stay in place. There are quite a few different sized ear cups included so chances are you will find just the right ones for your ears. The battery life is great and the IPX8 water resistance is a great feature and actually much better than the more expensive buds I looked at. I have been using them pretty hard for a week and have no complaints at all.  For me they were a great buy!",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
Good - the case is small. The sound is good. The earbuds make a nice tight seal (in my ear)Bad - connection lag is around 5 seconds (which is interminable when you want to answer a call).

"These are everything you'd want in earbuds. A few things to consider depending on your needs... They really cancel out ambient noise, so if you want to hear what's gong on around you for safety (running, skiing, etc), be aware of this. All features are controlled by touch, and as far as I can tell the touch only works with skin, so if you'll be wearing gloves, you cannot control the earbuds without taking your gloves off. They stick out a little farther than Apple earbuds, so if you'll be wearing a tight helmet (like for skiing or tight stalking cap over your ears), may not be the best.",4,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"These are easy to use straight out of the box. It’s very easy to get used to the controls and once you find the earpiece that fits snugly, these are pretty much noise canceling. I was surprised how small the case is so it’s really easy to carry anywhere. And the sound is superb!As an added note, it is hard for me to find earbuds that feel secure because I have piercings on my inner cartilage. These are fantastic, I gave them a good head shake and they didn’t budge.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0

"I like that the case is super slim and can fit in front pockets without being annoying. I especially like that I can use either ear individually while the other charges (the other brands that I’ve tried don’t do work like that, only one side can connect to the phone).Sound quality is pretty good, wouldn’t consider these as legit noise cancellation earbuds but they are a great value for the price.",5,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
"Great earbuds, with excellent quality. This isn't a bot review, I absolutely love these. Water-resistant, as promised, and tested. Battery life is a slight drawback, but with moderate use, the case may need to be charged once or twice per week. Not bad at all.3/31: Ordered on Christmas, an issue with the right earbud surfaced about a week ago. Emailed Tozo and they offered to send me a brand new replacement without even asking for the old one back. Not all companies have customer service like this.",5,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
I love everything about these earbuds. I bought these to use while running and working out because my old ear buds wires would get in the way. The convenience of paying the low price as opposed to the price of air pods. I really like the case and the size options because everyone’s ear canals are different. They’re very easy to use and I was worried about the touch feature being too sensitive. However it’s not too sensitive and nice to have. The killer for me about these are that the max volume is not that loud. I have to keep it on max volume for just about all songs and most aren’t loud enough which is the reason I’m leaving a 4 star review,4,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"I previously ordered Samsung Buds for use with my Samsung Galaxy S9 cell phone. Once they arrived I tried each of the different sizes and could not find a good fit. The sound was also weak without any good bass, so I returned them and the price was around $120. I found these Tozo T6 buds at amazon after an extensive search, read the wonderful reviews and decided to give them a try. Well, let me tell you, they fit perfectly right out of the box, charge fast, sound great with wonderful bass and crisp highs. They paired immediately with my cell phone, and the best part is, they do not fall out of my ears, even when working out on the treadmill at my gym! Do not hesitate to buy them as they cost me one third the price of the Samsung buds, and are overall, much better!",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"LOVE these. They came already charged, so I popped them in right away. Fantastic sound quality. Comfortable. Paired with my phone super easily.

"I had been looking at these ear buds for a long time, but I was hesitant to purchase them because of the lower price. I thought the quality would be lower, but these are great ear buds. Pairing the ear buds to my phone was a breeze, and the sound quality was excellent. It comes with a user manual that is very intuitive, and after about 15 minutes of setup (reading the manual), they were working perfectly. It comes with a nice case and usb cord for charging.

I am very happy with my purchase and the Tozo brand.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
These are literally the BEST headphones I've ever owned. The sound is so crispy. The bass is just *chef's kiss*. My dog was barking RIGHT next to me and I barely heard him. I did not regret buying these at ALL.Edit: I went down to 3 stars because they die within an hour or less. That's super frustrating. I've had them less than a month & have only used them a handful of times. The battery should last way longer.,3,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"These are really great and are now my go to earbuds of several I own. They are very comfortable, generally secure in the ear and easy to pair. The design puts them way ahead of many other products. These are really lightweight and compact but the sound is still terrific. Great sound balance and clarity as well a great stereo separation. Doesn't seem to have a booming bass but the bass still comes through fine for me. Sound exclusion is very good for the price. They work perfectly with my wireless charger. The touch controls work well and are very convenient The battery life seems very good but I haven't tested the limits yet. So far I have only used them at home and in the gym so I need to see how they do on a longer plane ride in terms of sound/noise cancelling and battery life.

A must buy!",5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
Bought these and they were great at first then one ear bud stopped working. The volume on one ear bud is so quiet it's practically useless and who wants to listen to music in just one ear.The only steps they have online is to reset the headphones which I've tried multiple times the last few weeks but it doesn't change. Might as well invest the money in a better set that will last.,1,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"When I first got these earbuds, one of them was far louder than the other. I think this is from water damage, because over time, the audio balance issue fixed itself as I kept them dry. The audio quality, battery life, and noise blocking are pretty decent. You will get good bluetooth range, although sometimes one of the earbuds will randomly disconnect for a few seconds and then reconnect. The touch controls on the earbuds are very convenient. I wear these while I work, and even through thin gloves they can detect pressure. You can even press your shoulder into your ear to pause them, which is super useful when your hands are full. The tradeoff is that they are very sensitive buttons, and something like water will interfere with the touch sensitivity.Overall, these are a great value for the money, just keep them away from water and you should be good.",3,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"Great so far, touch sensitivity is working well. Coming from earbuds with buttons I appreciate not having to push the buds into my ears just to trigger an action.A note about volume control, it only works for music, you cannot adjust phone volume while on a call.",5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"I cannot stress this enough, this was the best purchase I've ever made concerning earbuds in YEARS. I kid you not these are great and are perfect for pretty much anything!

I was also extremely surprised and pleased by the distance these earbuds cover. They take some getting use to the controls, but they are so worth it!",5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"Very intuitive designed case as well as buds.  Very intuitive user interface and manuals easy to understand.  I don't believe they could have paired with my phone faster!  Very good dynamic range, treble and bass replication.  Certainly an excellent product for the money.  As a matter of fact, I cannot believe I'd need any other functionality than what these provide.  Would highly recommend.",5,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
So far so good was able to get a real tight fit with the ones that came already installed. Very easy to pair. Stays in the ear well so far when working in the yard. If anything changes I will update.I wanted to add a quick update after I actually put the product in and checked it out. At first I thought the volume was too low for me until I realized I couldn't hear anything from outside even went out and cranked up my lawn mower and could not hear my lawn mower at all. Excellent product so far tight fit makes the base sound really clean and not artificially enhanced to the point that it distorts the sound. A lot of people say this is a good product for the price I say this is a good product period regardless of price. If something changes I'll come back and update but so far extremely pleased.,5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,1
"I've not had much success with earbuds because my ears are quite small.  I was very happy to find these buds that have 6 different silicone sizes included in the box.

"Best ear buds for the price, hands down! The only thing they don't have it active noise cancellation, but I don't find paying an extra$100 for ear buds with that feature to be worth it. The seal created by the rubber ear piece is enough to block out all noise (passive noise cancelling). Battery life is good. I've never had an issue with them don't throughout the day. Sound quality isn't the ultra quality of $150-$200 ear buds but it's def high quality sound. Adjusting your players equalizer helps improve sound quality if needed.

If I touch the flat part of the right (I don't know about the left) earbud, it forwards to the next song or video which can be pretty annoying.",4,1,2020-2-19,1,1,0
"These TOZO T6 earbuds have incredible sound! The best I have ever experienced in an earbud. MORE important--I have the gene for WET EAR. Sad. That means almost all earbuds just fall out, but not these! They stay in!!! Following the instructions, they rotate toward the back of your ear and create just enough tension to STAY IN PLACE, even with my wet ear gene. This is such a big deal! Not only does fitting them in according to the instructions give a perfect fit, but it also perfects the sound. I'm blown away! Had my first workout--NO PROBLEM! Battery life? I've used them 5 or 6 times for at least an hour, and they have never run out, and the case which charges them while you're not wearing them has only been charged once! These things are amazing! Win! Win! Win! Enjoy! SW",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"I’m not an expert in headphone quality but I love these earbuds! I was wanting airpods but didn’t want to spend a fortune so I purchased these and I do not regret it! The touch sensors are pretty responsive and have come in handy. I wear these to work and the case fits right in my pocket. I’ve dropped the case plenty of times, the earbuds will sometimes fall out depending on the impact but they still work with no issue. Connecting them to my phone is super easy, and I can listen with just one earbud too. I do notice the noise cancellation although I can still slightly hear my surroundings  with nothing playing but with audio playing, it cancels out (depending on the volume).",5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"Order & delivery of product was as expected.  Sound packaging and instructions.  Left ear buds would charge past 80% initially and then never reached 80% again while dwindling down to 60% & 40% throughout the troubleshooting process.  The manufacturer Tozo has a website and troubleshooting information.  It wasn't hard to follow the troubleshooting steps and it didn't help so I emailed them.  They responded quickly, I gave them all info/troubleshooting steps and they asked for a screenshot of my order and I gave to to them.  I received a replacement set free of charge and was not required to send the defective set back.  The new set works as expected, discharges and recharges as expected.  I try to never use any of my electronics to their max, battery-wise, but these fit my needs for around the house use w/out fighting with the cord.  Decent product.",5,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
"Low review for several reasons, the design is horrible, doesn't sit in the ear well and besides that fact that they fall out easily no matter the rubber adjustment for them they constantly feel like they are on the verge of falling out.I was aware that these were touch and was slightly concerned and rightfully so. The touch is so sensitive if my hair is even slightly wet from sweating it will pause or play what I'm listening to.",2,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
I purchased my first iPhone last week!!!  Was a flip phone guy forever so I am new to Bluetooth so I ordered todo 6 a little bit nervous about the product. When received the product they were in my ears and sounding great in about 5 minutes!!! I wore them all day around the house doing chores.....I even had them in the house while I was working in the garage and they never missed a beat!!!  GREAT PRODUCT!!!! Ps. I’ve worked construction most of my life which means I have major hearing loss and the sound is great!!!,5,1,2020-7-31,1,1,0
Only had these for a day or so now but man... so far they rock.  They connected with ease.  Once I changed out the rubber ear piece for a smaller one they fit perfectly.  The sound is amazing.  I’m returning some AirPod knock offs tomorrow and hoping these do the trick.  I travel a LOT and so I loved how these seem to be more noise cancelling and I also love the wireless charging.  Will update after a week or two of usage.,5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,1
"I have tried numerous Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth Headphones including AirPods and this one by far is my favorite.  I also own the TOZO T10 which is a good headset and seems to have a louder volume range than the T6.  However,  theT6 fits in my ear much better than the T10  and the smaller footprint for the case is another plus.  The fact that both the T6 & T10 work with a wireless charger is also an advantage over numerous of the other wireless earbuds I have purchased in the past.  Overall, the only issue that I have had with this headset is accidentally dropping a call when trying to reseat the earbud because of the sensitivity of the touch controls.  The bottom line, as someone that has tried too many wireless earbuds to count this, is definitely one of the best.",5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
"I ordered these for my girlfriend to use for her phone calls for work, I was very surprised by the build quality and the features for the money.  The packaging was very nice as well and it actually came with a good user guide and instructions.  The call quality is way better than the JBL Bluetooth earbuds I ordered for her previous.  These connect extremely fast when you take out of the case, I also like that in the box it comes with five other sets of tips in different sizes.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"The are great for inside noise cancelling headphones. I ended up having to use giant diesel mowers this year instead of my regular job. These fit inside the over the ear safety headphones and last all day. Sounds quality was good without having to crank it up and damaged my hearing. I did drop one a few times, but managed to find it eventually. It's a bit frustrating when I accidently touch the sensor when trying to adjust them.  Still wonderful. Worth the price definitely!",5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"What can I say?  So far these work great and sound nice too.  At first, they felt a bit boomy, however, after the firmware update, they sound better.  Search for ""TOZO T6 firmware"" and update yours if you have not done so already.  The overall package is nice and neat and they fit very comfortably in my ear.  My only complaint is that the sides of the earbuds are too smooth and at times make it challenging to remove earbuds from the case.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
Not getting paid to say this. These earbuds are amazing. I wear them and listen to music and watch YouTube almost all day. I havnt had any issues with people hearing me when I use them to talk on the phone. I wear them when I ride on my motorcycle and I can hear the music just fine. I would 100 percent recommend. I also recommend the silicon case as it works well and really completes this product.,5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,1
I just got these and they ROCK... I have tried a few pair and these out do them 10 fold. I love being able to sit in the living room while my husband watches TV and I can listen to my audiobook. Well worth the cost!!,5,1,2020-5-25,1,1,0
"I want to like these wireless headphones. They fit great and sound good. The battery life is fine.  What brings there down is the touch control. It's abysmal. Trying to control this is next to impossible, holding down doesn't turn it off/on and trying to control the volume just goes forward or reverse. maybe it's just me, but I've had plenty of other capacitive touch headphones and they were way easier than this.",3,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"I love that the case is so compact, you can charge the case and the earbuds at the same time, AND the battery life is AWESOME.  clarity and base are also impressive, tho people have trouble hearing me during a call.  What I really don't like about these buds, however, is that the shape is awkward and they don't fit in my ears well.  Not sure if this is a design flaw of the product or of the human, but they just don't like to stay in my ears.  doesn't matter if I use tiny bud pads or big ones, or middle-sized, none fit just right.  They come loose and fall out, no matter how I try to make them stay.  May work better for big-eared folk, but those with smaller ears might do better to find something else.",3,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"These drive me crazy!! You cannot touch either piece to readjust or remove without it thinking you want to pause, restart the song, or fast forward/backward. It's not intuitive at all. The bluetooth connectivity is great and they paired quickly, but I would recommend an earbud that doesn't skip half an album if you brush your hair past your ear or go to readjust your mask.",2,1,2020-9-18,1,1,0
"I was really excited to try these earbuds based off the reviews. However after a couple of uses in the shower, which the manual specifically says they’re approved for use, the volume on the right earbud significantly decreased. I let them dry out, used a blow dryer, and nothing. I only used them for my recovery cold showers after workouts which were a few min at a time so they weren’t submerged. Manufacturer only suggested to blow dry and wasn’t much help after that. Had to work a return through Amazon.",1,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"These are great little ear buds for the money. They sound great, and I'm a bit of an audiophile. The battery life has been great. I've only charged the case twice since I've bought them. It's very easy to use either both of them or just one at a time. The case is small and charges wirelessly which is awesome. My only complaint is as others have mentioned, they're a bit difficult to remove from the case. I have average sized hands but the earbuds are kind of slick and the magnets hold quite well, which is good really. Even with that considered I would definitely recommend these. Especially if you're about to drop $100+ on some name brand ones that likely are the same.",5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"These seem to work well enough, but the sound quality is not comparable to even cheap wired earbuds. These also tend to work their way out of my ear, even if I'm only walking around, so I'm constantly fiddling with them to make sure they don't fall out. Since they have touch controls, trying to get them jammed in your ear properly can start/stop the music.They seem to pair well and consistently. The battery life seems fine, and the charging case works well.",2,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0
"I am very pleased with these.  I purchased them because the ones I purchased before this had really poor battery life.  Those were lighter and more comfortable, but these work.  Took me a bit to figure out the commands but at least there was a manual.  Next I will be using them for a Zoom meeting to do a presentation and expect it will be fine.",4,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"Solid pair of Bluetooth headphones. Battery life on each unit is great, 5-6 hours before I start thinking about needing to plug them back into the case. The case can charge them fully 3-4 times before it needs a charge, so great performance.Sound quality is good, especially for the size of unit. I have no problems using it for music or spoken word. Haven’t tested the phone capabilities of it yet, though.",4,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
"Love mine! They are amazing especially for the price. The box they came in was really nice and neatly packaged. Looking at the box and opening it Looking at the contents you would think you paid alot more for them.The quality, sound, etc is great i am amazed considering they aren't as expensive as the LG's i have purchased before. No more LG's for me. These are great! I will update if anything changes.",5,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0
Update 4/23/20:Received replacement. Changing from 3-star to 4-star. Can't give a 5-star review until I see how long this 2nd pair holds up.,4,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0
"I bought these because I needed ear buds with the kids learning from home and me working from home.  I didn't want to spend a ton of money because, honestly, I don't like things in my ears.  These have a great sound and they defintely cancel out the noise.  They are a bit touchy in that I adjust them in my ear and am constantly finding myself having to turn them back on because I hit the button.  highly recommend.",5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
This is my first pair of wireless earbuds.  And I have to say that I was skeptical about the level of quality I would receive from this product.  Those doubts quickly went away.  This is a very well-designed product.  It’s a self-conatained unit that allows you to charge the earbuds in the case.  The case itself is magnetized so your earbuds don’t rattle around.  The power outlet has a water resistant seal.  The sound quality is fantastic.  And they have long power durations during charges.  The packaging is similar to the high quality packaging guy receive from Apple products.  And you receive various sizes of earbuds to ensure you’re able to get the correct fit.  Will definitely purchase fro this company again!,5,1,2020-10-4,1,0,0
I absolutely love these ear buds. Sound quality is very good and noise canceling is perfect. They fit my ears better than any other I have tried. Battery wis great for me because I only use them a few hours a day. Live the fact I can answer my phone and control my music or videos with a tap to the ear bud. Sound quality when on a call is awesome. Money well spent.,5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"Listening to music is fine on these. The bass is nice and overall clear sound. They’re a little heavy but my biggest issue is I got these for calls and some basic recordings. When I use these, it amplifies all the background noise in the room. Like worse than having my phone on speaker. Wish I could return them but didn’t realize how bad they were til I had them for awhile...",3,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"Product arrived a day faster than expected even when ordering with prime.  I got the Tozo T6 and it easily paired with my Samsung s8+, my surface Pro, and my Mac book.  I was unable to pair multiple devices at the same time, but that is not that big of a deal.  Sound and audio is great.  I only notice the noise cancellation a little bit, but it is functional. I made some test calls and I sounded clear to the receiver.  Would reccomend to anyone especially for the price.",5,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0
"These little buds work great! I’ve only charged the battery pack they are stored in and used them for over 15 hours, still haven’t recharged the pack. They stay in when doing box jumps and jump rope. I’ve never owed any of the apple or beats versions so comparing to sound quality and noise cancellation I can’t say as much. I have to turn them off though if I want to talk to someone. I literally can’t hear them.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"Easy to use, initial sound not good to installed the galaxy app for speaker control on phone- much better, also like the charger in the case, can recharge ear buds 3-4 times before recharging case. Someone mentioned they did not like the sound confirmation on the buds, I like it as it tells you which in right ear and which is left ( they are not labeled).",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"The are amazing! They are small, sleek, come with several ear plug sizes for your comfort. Charges and connects rapidly with no delay. Haven't had the first issue. Very pleased. I gave the sound quality a 4 star as they lack on bass, so if you love EDM you may be let down, but pod casts and all other music sound great. They are extremely comfortable, I forget they are there. To pause music you just gently place your finger on it and it will pause, no need to shove the speaker deep into your ear attempting to pause it. Overall very pleased. Would buy again",4,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"Unlike other headphones,  these air easily every time.  They are easy on your ears, so you can use them much longer without irritation.The last for many hours without needing a charge and come with an very useful charging case and usb cord.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"got these Bluetooth ear buds to workout with ease at the gym - I honestly believe the quality is excellent, especially at the price point. I can sanitize them without deteriorating the quality of the coating, which I find important after a sweaty workout. The sound quality is decent and the noise cancellation was a nice surprise.However, I did not give this five stars because of the inconsistency in call quality. With the pandemic, I have been on many calls or video calls and rely on these buds. Many times, I have been told that it sounds like I’m on speaker or that it is difficult to hear me.",4,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
"Bought these a few months ago not wanting to spend a ton of money on AirPods. These are really great. I use them when working out or doing yard work. Sound quality is really good and the battery lasts forever. They do an pretty good job on noise cancellation. Touch controls can be a tad touchy at times but that may because my left ear bud went bad. However, the customer service team was great! They had me do a few simple test procedures and then sent me a replacement earbud. Worth ever dollar spent on these. You will not regret this purchase.",4,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"I wasn’t sure how well these would work but I was very surprised at how great they are. Sound quality is perfect when taking calls or listening to music. Pairing them to my phone was easy as well. I even love the charging case, it’s perfect and lasts for a long time. (Weeks) the magnet in the case is pretty effective but it takes me a minute to take them out... also the music functions on the buds are a little sensitive so I end up changing or pausing my music without meaning to.. other than those two tiny issues, the buds are perfect and do what they are intended to do. I love them and so does my husband.",5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,1
"Usually I dont write reviews much, however I love this product and couldnt keep quite.  This is my second Tozo after T10.  Both runs for long lasting battery and wireless charging cases.  I have good amount of earbuds now, 2 Jabaras, 2 Tozos and Sennheiser.  I love all of them but Tozo is special because of quality & pricing and moreover wireless charging cases in best pricing ever.Pros:",5,1,2019-9-29,1,0,0
"Super easy to pair - all I did was hold them for a few seconds and it in my settings it t was already there.  Fits way better than my AirPods and it’s way less money!  I lost an AirPod which is why I needed new earbuds.  T6 comes with 6 different ear pad sizes.  I needed the smallest one and it’s super snug.  No chance of losing these!  Sound quality is so much better because of the snug fit.  I love apple products, but T6 is a 10!  Gave the battery life 3 because I just got these and I am so impressed that I haven’t charged them yet.  I’m shaking my head and they’re still in my ears!  I LOVE THESE!!!",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"Really, if the sound quality is this bad, with no depth/range of sound, why bother using them? For the price, I guess if you are listening to a podcast or audio book then they work fine. But music sounds terrible - no bass. I mean - NO BASS. Other than that, the fit is great and seem to hold a charge well. Keep in mind these are quite large in the ears - mine look like massive white blobs in my ears (might want to get black so they blend in a bit better).",1,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0
"After 2 weeks review:I was so excited to get these and dance with them, I'm a dancer and I also work on a boat so I really needed them to stay in and perform well .  The most common problem I have is that even when my hair is up they will sometimes stop working as if they have been paused and I have no idea what causes it as I didn't press pause or anything. And sometimes I hear a horrible high pitched noise in the left earbud. I have to take it out and charge it to make it stop.....not ideal. Also I wish they were a bit easier to take out of the case....are my fingers really that big?? Haha. Love the sleek look and the black. I can hide these in my hair when it's down and get away with them at work. Loveeeee that part. Wish they worked a lil better.",1,1,2019-10-29,1,0,0
"These are awesome! The sound quality is amazing as is the noise canceling. I tested the phone function, which I really won’t be using them for, and it definitely sounded echo-y and a bit distant, but survivable. I got them for music though and they don’t disappoint! They’re super easy to pair and operate. Both the case and the earbuds feel solid and well put together, they also stay secure in my ears. Love them!",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"I was skeptical at first with the touch controls since I’m used to fiddling around for a button to manage volume, but these work well!

"Works quite well. I use it for audiobooks at work. Used together, sound quality and noise cancellation is very good. You can switch out the ear cushions to get the fit and sound quality that suits you best. I use them separately, so as to hear the phone and coworkers, but also to elongate battery life between charging. Which can be done in its wireless case.",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"The fact that this is a FRACTION of the cost of Apple Airpods yet has much better functions is a huge reason why you shouldn't pass on this! I love the touch function to pause, increase volume, and skip. They are smaller than the Airpods and can be easily concealed in your hair if needed. The charge lasts a very long time! Definitely worth it if you're looking for a dupe.",5,1,2020-9-28,1,0,0
"I’m surprised these earbuds has air of good reviews.  I’ve had many earbuds from really expensive to this.  I’ve ordered a $15 earbuds along with this and those earbuds blows Tozo out of the water.

"I have had these earbuds for nearly a year and use them daily. Whether it's running, hiking, biking, or doing laundry, they stay in my ears and provide good sound. I like that I can just use one ear bud when I need to, to stay aware of cars while I'm biking. The case provides a quick charge and is small enough to fit in my pocket. I recently had the charging case die, and when I contacted Tozo customer service they were quick to respond and resolve my issue. I would solidly recommend.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
I have been looking for a good set of earbuds for mainly making phone calls on my iPhone 11 and I finally found it with the TOZO T6. The sound is great both for music and making calls.

That being said, the battery life still functions well. Usually 3 of the 4 lights are still on when I get home. So I imagine switching out would last the entire 10 hours and then some.

"I bought this one over the older model cause I read that it was smaller. Having a naturally small ear I always think of these things. The smallest insert was still way too big for my ear which caused it to fall out. If you have small ears I’d probably reconsider. The sound quality is great so I just took the insert off completely and listen to it without. Overall, good product, maybe not the best one for my anatomy lol but still a good product",3,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
This is the 3rd one I’ve purchased.  I gave my first one to my niece because I wanted the rose color one.  I juts bought my fiancé the white one for Father’s Day.  They are great for working out and don’t fall out even when you sweat!  Yes they are waterproof.  I accidentally left one of my ear buds in my pants pocket and it got put in the washer and dryer and they work perfectly fine!  Noise canceling is great!  Distance without your phone is good too!  I work in a 2-story office and leave my phone at my desk and walk around with one ear bud in and it doesn’t lose connection.  Love these!,5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"I do not typically write review. However; I felt compelled to review my Tozo T6 headphones as I spent much time reading others before purchasing and want to give my honest opinion to those in the market. My first gripe is the fact that I was missing a charging cable when I opened them up. Not a huge deal as I have others laying around but I did pay for it to be included. The sound quality is clear, but the volume doesn’t get nearly as high as I expected. I don’t need it to be blaring but a bit higher would be nice. Noise cancelation is par. The best feature is the touch control on each earbud; many other brands in the price range do not have this. Additionally, I noticed they can not determine what device I am trying to connect with; they automatically sync to the last one I used if both are within range.  All in all they are a solid buy given the price in which I paid. I would recommend for anyone on a budget or looking for a secondary pair of earbuds.",3,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0
"Worked great upon arrival. After a week of using the earbuds, they started disconnecting intermittently from my phone while I was on calls and would not connect to my computer. Contacted Amazon support, they were great but still did not get them working properly. Replacements arrived the next day and I have just started using them. So far so good, but hoping they continue working as expected. Will update review after using for a couple weeks.",3,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"These headphones shipped in just over a week. When they arrived the presentation was nice and they gave a good first impression. Everything seems sleek, sturdy and quality. However, after using them after just one day, I’ve already come across some problems. A big one is there are no physical buttons to press on the headphones themselves. While I do love touch technology, this can get quite annoying when you need to cycle through the features. Additionally they can be paused and played by touch which causes many accidental pauses when I just meant to adjust the ear bud. Not a huge deal though, just something to think about. The volume of these headphones are also not the loudest. I work in a loud-ish environment and I would love it if these could get a few levels higher. The biggest problem I had was one of my earbuds broke the FIRST time it fell out of my ear. My left earbud will no longer work after its first contact with the tile. The fragility of this product is something that shouldn’t be ignored. Something to think about!",3,1,2019-11-13,1,0,0
"These Tozo buds are very convenient. They fit my ears well and stay in once I ""screw"" them in. Of course, the more fully they are seated, the fuller the sound, which is excellent for a $50 product. Good controls by tapping: on/off, pause, answer call, Siri on either bud; vol up and FF on right, vol down and RR on left. VERY NICE is the compact, nicely crafted charging case which itself holds a charge for long time and in turn charges the buds many times. It took me a while to get used to the tapping controls, but patience pays off with these. Very pleased!!",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0

The only thing I dislike is that I can easily lose one or both ear pieces if I happen to drop them, but my suggestion is to buy the brighter colored headphones available as I purchased the black ones. On the other hand I really like that I can recharge them several times in the protection case without having to drag along a charger or find an electrical outlet to plug it into.

"Googled best wireless ear phones, Tozo was at the very top of the list, above Apple and Bose,, but not above their price,, purchased the Tozo for a fraction of the cost,, so if you want a little apple sign on your earphones you better dish out another $150,,but if you don't have money to blow,, like me,, then these are the ones,, I use them in the gym everyday at 4am before I go to work,, and so far they are great,, the functions are easy to use, 1 tap is play or pause, 2 taps is next song, long hold tap does volume,,, and it's very easy to use,, and they are water resistant, so I don't have to worry about sweating or jumping in the shower right after pumping iron,, (i pick things up and put them down)....",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"Pretty impressed with these T6 earbuds. I've never been a person to spend a bunch of money on Air Pods or Galaxy Buds but I was looking for something that had good sound quality and wasn't going to break the bank. I use earbuds when im mowing the lawn or working out. I aas a little concerned that they would fall out of my ears but so far so good. They feel pretty secure in my ears even with me most active movements. The sound quality is pretty fantastic too, they are very loud and have real good bass. The package comes with plenty of different sized ear pieces and the charger/case is of excellent quallity. I think my favorite part is that they are touch screen so you can change songs, pause, or adjust the volume just by placing your finger on the flat part of the ear bud.If you're in the market for a quality set of earbuds that are loud and not too expensive, I'd recommend these.",5,1,2020-3-29,1,0,0
"These are amazing! I just ordered a second pair. Sound is great, works in the shower, while running, working out etc... the only negative is that it's a little hard to forward the song, often I have to tap multiple times but other than that no complaints especially for the price. I've had jaybirds that were awful and easy more expensive, glad I found these",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"Can’t ask for more for the price paid. Easy pairing and the Bluetooth stays connected when my phone is halfway across the house. Multiple size ear pieces, so I would think no one would have any trouble with these fitting their ears. Love how low profile and comfortable they are and the outside noise blockage is surprisingly good for non-ANC earbuds. I’d recommend these to anyone.If I had to have one gripe, it would be that they don’t get quite loud enough if I were to ever really want to “jam out”. Still great though, especially for the price.",5,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"I have been using these heavily for a couple of months now and they work great for audio/listening to music. Haven't tested the mic quality much. They stick out from your ears farther than the apple version, and they have kind of an annoying startup message (a voice letting you know the earbud is on/paired), but overall great, especially for the lower pricepoint.",5,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0

"I bought these ear buds 5 months ago and was happy with them, the sound is great for the price point of the ear buds. Recently they stopped charging all the way, I'd get to the gym and would get the ""battery low"" notice before getting the chance to use them.  I believe it had something to do with the charger. I contacted Tozo and they offered to replace them, my new ones are currently charging and I'm returning the old ones. I didn't expect that at all and am pleasantly surprised at the generosity of the company and the quick response. I use these ear buds a couple hours a day and until recently they've held up well. I've worn headphones where I couldn't hear my music over the gym music and sounds and that's not the case with these.",4,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0
"After trying every ear bud cap size I finally found the perfect fit.  This is an extremely important step as it does affect the bass and treble quality.  The bass, treble, and mid-ranges are near perfect.  The volume is good but I was a little disappointed they aren't just a bit louder.  I love listening to EDM and for me the louder the better.  Overall these are an exceptional value with great quality.  They are light weight and stay in the ears once you find the perfect cap for your ears.  The battery life is exceptional.  I used them for watching TV for over 4 hours with no interruption.  I would recommend them for anyone wanting a great pair of earbuds who don't want to spend a fortune!",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"I use these earbuds nearly every day to listen to podcasts and music and also to make calls for work.  Conceptually, I like the design, but the execution of it seems to miss the point.The case is a very compact design and looks nice.  However, I have big hands and I have difficulty getting the earbuds out of the case.  I like the size of the earbuds.  They are small and unobtrusive.  However, I have tried different tips and cannot get them to stay in my ear.  Also, the left earbud tends to be quieter and/or muffled.  Finally, the speakers tend to rattle at pretty low levels.",2,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
These earbuds are way better than expected. The packaging is beautiful! It comes with different size earbuds to fit your individual ears. When I first used it I thought the bass was not very good. However the bass and sound quality were great once I changed the ear buds to one that better fit my ear. Don’t hesitate to buy. People keep on asking me where I got these ear buds. Some people I know have the Apple ones and keep on having issues! I love these so much don’t hesitate to buy!!!!,5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Update: These headphones keep disconnecting from my computer while I'm in the middle of using them. This is very annoying and also embarrassing when they just shut off and my music or school videos start blasting in a quiet space out of nowhere. It's also very distracting to have to keep connecting them.My bf bought this and he loved them so much that I ended up buying the exact same pair. Looking forward to Bluetooth headphones with noise-canceling abilities, I’m a student and it makes it a lot easier for me to concentrate. I also appreciate that they don’t loop behind the ear and I’m able to wear my glasses with them.",1,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
This is my first pair of wireless earbuds and I love them. I got a great fit with the earplugs provided (5 options) and was able to use them right out of the box. Have had no issues with draining them between charges and the sound quality has been great. Haven’t tried them with the phone. I did have an issue with the sound going out but a quick chat with Amazon and a factory reset cleared it up.,5,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0

"These are super easy to use and pair with your phone. I was looking for a pair of Bluetooth earbuds that I could use for my conference calls so that I could eliminate the wire for my regular headphones. These were easy to pair with my phone and so far have helped cut down the noise around me. I was hoping for a little more bass for listening to music but not a big deal overall. I like the usability in being able to answer and hang up calls, connect to Siri, and music control functions.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"I just received these and charged them up and connected them to my iPhone 11 Pro Max.  They came right on after I took them out of the case and connected right up with the blue tooth.  Don't know about battery life yet but I can say they charged up fully pretty quickly which is great.  The bass is a little muffled, but that is comparing it to an over the ear noise canceling set I have.  I like that they included so many options for the ear pieces, I have difficulty getting them to work and stay on with previous ones, but with these the ones that were on them when they arrived worked great and fit nice and snug.  They are waterproof so they should be sweat proof to.  I plan to try them with my laptop for using with Zoom.  The controls are easy and responsive.  Day one is looking mighty darn fine.",4,1,2020-3-25,1,0,0
"I've only had these since January, and I do love them BUT- they have recently begun to not fully connect to the case. This means they will connect to my phone, and since they make a partial connection, it causes my music to constantly play, pause, play, pause, over and over until I manually remove the headphones from my Bluetooth devices. This is incredibly annoying considering there isn't a way to just turn them off.",1,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0

With BT 5, the range is so much better than any other set I've had. The sound is very good. The battery life is great. They stay put when I'm at the gym and they (passively) block a lot ambient sound. I wore them while mowing my yard yesterday, and I could barely hear my mower.

These are more expensive then the T10 yet the sound quality and volume is significantly worse? How’s that possible... on top of that the touch controls is literally the worst feature you can possibly have for earbuds... you can be working out and adjust the position so they don’t fall out only to pause or skip ur track... honestly one of the worst purchases of earbuds I’ve ever made... the T10 model is far superior.Update.... these things constantly do not charge in the case now the right side is completely broken and does not hold a charge...,1,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0

I let me start out that I’m 54 and I don’t know how much hearing loss I have !  I am very displeased on how loud theses are!  I love the comfort and battery life!

They are waterproof the touch sensor works well unless you are soaking wet then it tends to have false touches. They sound good but don’t have the same base as the t10 but do have better battery life. My biggest complaint Is that when the pods fully charge and they stop charging they instantly turn on even though they are still in the case personal opinion the t10 is a better earbud system even if they have a rather stiff start stop button,3,1,2019-11-12,1,1,0

The price is incredible compared to others.  I experienced a little trouble with one of the earbuds and contacted the company and they immediately got back to me and resolved the issue. For that reason alone they are worth being your source to enjoy music, make calls, and maybe listen to your favorite streamed show privately so you are not driving your significant other crazy.

I like the fact that it comes with multiple ear tips with varied styles making comfort that much more achievable as I find that most in-ear earbuds cause pain.

The Tozo T6 is a very light weight wireless earbud with great quality sound and noise cancellation. I have them now for about 6 months. It is so light that sometimes I forget that it is in my ear. However the only problem I have with the design architecture is getting it out from the charging case. It does have magnetic connectors and pins so getting them out can be tough sometimes since your fingers can not really get around them in the case. I advise anyone to not try getting them out in a dark place cause you could easily drop them.Lately I became to experience charging problem with the Earbuds. They don't go off in the case making them to discharge faster. I emailed support and tried their suggested tips but still having problem. They are willing to give me a replacement so i hope all goes well.,4,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
I love the fact that these earbuds are waterproof and can charge wirelessly. The sound is amazing and the battery life can’t be beat.

"Earbuds are a great purchase, though I could use a little sparkle & bling, but that’s just me. I am thoroughly Enjoying the sound quality which is awesome on any song I throw at it. So far the battery life is good; I wish the buds themselves would last a little longer before having to put them away in their case, but good for what I need. The case is well made but a bit slippery so be careful it doesn’t accidentally disappear from your pocket.All in all I really like my purchase.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
These worked right out of the box. No need to charge. I had bought a set like this (different brand) and was so disappointed. They lasted maybe two hours. These seem to last longer and charge a little faster in the case. It comes with extra ear pieces to get the size right. The stand size already on it seemed to fit just fine. The usb cable that comes with it is not very long but seems better than what you normally get. This has been a great purchase so far. The touch/no button feature works well. I didn’t think I cared to have it but now that I tried it? I really like it.,5,1,2019-11-25,1,0,1

I’m new to this kind of wireless earbuds. I’ve worn them a few times and they are amazing. They stay in my tiny ears just fine which was my main concern when purchasing. The sound is amazing!  Easy to use. Hold a charge for an incredible long time. Plus I love how the case will charge them without being plugged in to an outlet.  I still haven’t got the finger tap down yet on how to regulate volume or answer a call. That is a little confusing for me. But I’m sure I will figure out. All in all these were a great purchase!,5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,1
"This product is one hundred percent what you think your buying. These are cheaper, more accessible, true wireless ear buds, the sound quality is way better than what I've used in the past but is by no means the greatest, which is okay. The battery life is pretty standard, about 6 hours, which is enough for half a shift at work. I work in a rather loud place and these do a good job at making the machines quieter, and they come with extra cells to help find your fit. The real elephant in the room is that they randomly disconnect. I'm not entirely sure why they do this but it doesn't bother me, just let them do their thing and they reconnect in a few seconds press the button on a bud and and your back to your song or podcast.",4,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0

They fit so comfortable in the ear it's ridiculous. I did a run/dance test & never once felt like the earbuds were slipping out of my ears. Pairing on these is super duper fast. And the overall sound quality is quite pleasant. However, if you like a lot of bass these won't necessarily be the best for you.

The only thing that I faced with it is that when it first arrived, it had anti-dust covers on both the earbuds, and no one could hear me on the other side. I thought the microphone was faulty or not good. But it turned out that those anti-dust covers were obstructing the microphone. So, please remove those covers before using it.",4,1,2019-12-8,1,1,1

So, I went to Amazon and looked up bluetooth earbuds and came across TOZO. After seeing the price and reviews, I decided to get one and got the T6. As soon as I got it, I was amazed at how amazing it performed for the price I paid for it, seriously! I do recommend TOZO products as they are quality and their customer service is also stellar!

Music was true-to-life and, while there was plenty of bass, there wasn't excessive bass -  they provided a nice ""punch"".  They paired easily with my MP3 player and with my phone.They come with a cool carrying case that recharges the earbuds when not in use.  The earbuds come with four sets of ear tips to allow the best fit to your ears.  I found that getting the right set of ear tips for a proper fit was very important to getting the best sound.

However when I disconnected my phone and paired my watch it said it connected, but when trying to make a call the sound came from my watch instead of the ear buds. I'm pretty disappointed that it didn't work for what I bought them for. I will try a couple more times to connect it, but if not I think I'll try to return them along with my mom's, who wanted them for the same reason.",4,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"DO NOT TRY TO SWIM WITH THESE!!!fried my ears with them. Whole sight leads you to believe that they are ok to swim with, after feeling electric shocks in my ear when I dive in with them. I looked back at every part of their website which not state (not for swimming). Woke up the next day with bad skin irritation in both ears. My fault, so I cant give a bad review. Not as good of a sound as my Bose buds,  but good buds for the price. UPDATE - WON'T CHARGE AT ALL AFTER 2 WEEKS.",4,1,2020-6-9,1,1,0
"I decided to try these after not being able to find new styles of neckband earbuds that were worth a crap.I was concerned that size and weight would be an issue and they would fall out while going about my business.

"I'm a stickler for earbuds...If you're deciding between the T10s or T6, definitely go with the T6s! For only a few dollars more you get better sound quality and better battery life!

"These headphones changed my life for the better!!I was worried about buying into the wireless headphones; because of the price point, I wanted to make certain they were worth it, and MAN were they ever! I have the worst coworker and having these headphones that cancel out the sound of him angrily masticating (you read that wrong, i promise) at me, or listen to his political rantings, and these puppies do just the trick!",5,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"Well, before I wrote this review I followed the troubleshooting instructions, and even tried updating the firmware via the unlisted Android app (the APK on the website).The right earbud stopped working after the first day of use. I definitely tried to be patient because I've done a lot of troubleshooting before, but without voiding the ability to return the device, there is nothing I can do to get the right earbud to power on. If I can't get any response by the end of the day, I will return it as defective. I will update later.",1,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"I originally got the T10's for their great bass and didn't even know about the T6's. After asking TOZO a question about the mic that I was having trouble figuring out, they were kind enough to upgrade me to a pair of T6's. My first day with the T6 pair was an 8hr shift at work and I had them on almost the entire time and never noticed they were in my ear. The T10's were just a hair bigger and noticeable, but the T6 are sleek and slim. The battery lasted much longer, their touch control is by far my favorite feature, and the case is SO much smaller that you can't tell it's in your pocket. One con to the touch control I noticed would be if you wear them in the shower, if a water drop hits them it'll change the music or pause what you're doing. Aside from that, being able to just tap them to change a song is amazing compared to the hard click on the T10's. Overall, I'm very impressed with both versions, but if my T6 go bad, I'll definitely be getting another pair (unless a newer version is out by then).",5,1,2019-10-4,1,0,1
"Works pretty well. They seem to have a long battery life to them. I use them while riding my bmx bike at skateparks. Calls come in clear, never have to touch my phone. Music sound quality isn't terrible there just isn't any deep bass to them(which for the price isn't bad). The wireless charging for the case works as it should. Product packaging I give an A+. I would recommend.",4,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0

"I really wanted to love these for the price point, and for the great performance of the previous models. The “touch” control on these are ridiculously finicky and I spent more time messing with them rather than enjoying my music. The slightest touch or bump seemed to skip to the next song, pause music, or engage one of the function features.

Worst headphones I bought. Brand new out of the box and they sound like they are blown. BRAND NEW! Sound is horrible. Was pretty excited for these to arrive after reading reviews from others. I don’t know what to do now. Lost the box but have the headphones and charger case. Never again. I mean giving the benefit of the doubt maybe mine were just defected and that’s fine. But they been sitting on my desk being as paperweight. Literally.,1,1,2020-6-4,1,1,0
"I received these Tozo T6 headphones as part of a great customer service experience with the Company Tozo, I had the T10 headset but encountered an issue rendering the set useless and Tozo was quick to respond with a replacement and offered me the opportunity to try these out too! First out of the box I’m impressed by the quality of the product, the charger case is strong and has strong magnets, the materials don’t feel like cheap plastic, and the sound quality is awesome! The touch controls are sensitive and reactive once you get the hang of them. The bass is strong in both ear pieces, and pairing the headset was the easiest part of the whole experience, just take them out, wait a couple seconds and then select the headset out of your settings menu, I’m excited to get some long term use out of these and look forward to buying more products from Tozo!",5,1,2019-10-14,1,0,1
"The headphones themselves are great. Great sound and everything. The only thing I am not thrilled about is that these do drain my phone battery faster than other types.

"I bought a different pair of wireless earbuds from this same company and then later discovered that the phone control buttons were not very intuitive and rather challenging. I reached out to ask about whether there was any way to customize the wireless control to what I wanted. Unfortunately, there was not; but, the team was very helpful, extremely responsive, and actually provided me with this pair to make up for my initial disappointment. The customer service was out of this world. I didn't ask for a new pair and was expecting to be blown off but that is NOT what happened. The sound quality is awesome, button control is fairly intuitive, range is excellent, and all in all this is a great pair of headphones . The only reason I didn't provide a 5 star was because I have had other pairs of bluetooth headphones that I liked more when it comes to controlling my phone from the headset. That being said, the sound quality and range on the other sets were nowhere near what this pair has to offer.",4,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0

"I had three problems with these earbuds: 1) the cover for the USB charging port is way too tight — lol I've been using plastic sporks to pry the thing open! 2) the microphones are way too sensitive to environmental noises, mild breezes, and echoes from nearby walls, and are especially impractical for use while riding a bicycle, and 3) my poor Mr. Magoo eyes have to put on their reading glasses to see the L(eft) and R(ight) indicators on the individual earbuds. Other than that, the battery life is excellent for the size of the product, and the sound quality is really good, again for the size of the product. I'm bummed that I'm going to have to return these things, but I spend a lot of time on my bike and these just don't work too well for that.",3,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0

Takes a while to get use to the feeling of having pods in your ears this deep. I kept feeling the need to grab a Q Tip because wet wax would form more every time I put them in.

They have the best customer service!,5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
Good earbuds. Had to switch to the smaller earpieces for them to stay put. Get good distance from my phone before it cuts out. Left earbud skips back on the tracks and the right earbud jumps forward kinda wish they had put the function on both earbuds since I use them to listen to books so it limits what I can do with them. Over all I like them they stay put well and only fell out once.,5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"They worked right out of the box and paired to each other AND my phone AND my computer in seconds. Giving the earbuds and case their first full charge only took an hour. The sound is a little tinny and the base weaker than I prefer, but then I'm pretty spoiled by a high quality headset that I've been using for years. But for a pair of earbuds I plan to use when out and about and not at my computer, the sound quality is just fine. The only other con is that the touch controls are not quick to respond so I'm prone to trying them again, which only causes them to do something I didn't want. But I don't plan to use those controls much, so I can live with it. Overall, not a bad little set of earbuds.",5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
"If you are cheap like me and don't have enough to purchase the airpods (both old or new generation), these function just as well. The rubber ends back it easy to grab onto your ear as you're running. The great thing to is that I sweat a lot when I run, so having these stay in is a huge plus. At first I had a little bit of difficulty pairing them to my phone, but after it was paired, it was pretty seamless from then on.",5,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
"Just got these, been messing with them, LOVE the touch controls. I've come to the conclusion that sound quality comes from the device you're playing through. Good sound through cheap Android. I'm sure it will be better with iPhone, will update after I grab another. Took a shower with them on, worked great except the heated water would pause them like tapping them, then I'd turn my head and it would ""tap"" them back on. So far really like 'em! Don't notice any difference in sound from the 10's.",5,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
"The most salient selling points of this product are its build and sound quality, lucid control utilities, and the assortment of eartips that it comes with. The case is smooth and slick and the earbuds come in a waxy, jet black finish, which allows for more precise operating - not like other competitive counterparts that have a textured plastic (ABS?) finish that muddies haptic registration. It’s also fairly durable - I’ve dropped it a few times on the pavement, and there aren’t any signs of functional deterioration. The charging and battery life LEDs still work perfectly. I’m not having any issues with the sound quality either. As far as I can tell, the bass doesn’t have too much distortion, and in tandem with the noise cancellation, the sound really comes through with immaculate clarity. The assortment of eartips (6 pairs) also ensures that the earbuds will fit snugly in your ear. Would absolutely recommend.",5,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
"I'm being given a chance to update to these models from the T10 series, and I have to say that it's worth the upgrade. I feel WAY more comfortable when walking around with these buds in my ear than the last model. I'm not sure if it's a different size thing, but they just seem to fit very comfortably in my ear now, where the last one always felt as if I needed to push them back in.Sound quality is great! I'm not expert, but it's been good enough for me. The touch controls are great, easy to pause and raise and lower volume. The new case is fantastic and stylish. Pairing was beyond quick and painless.",5,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"These are really great headphones for the value. I have friends that have AirPods and they have issues with them all the time. I had issues once in a while with these, but usually it was because I needed to clean out the connectors or my case so that it would charge reliably. Once I did that, good as new.Something I’m always worried about is the connection reliability when I buy Bluetooth headphones. But with these, I never had a problem connecting my headphones to my phone. Sometimes, in fact, it was too reliable and they’d connect when I didn’t want them too (but this is a good problem to have, ha!)",5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0

I put off getting wireless earbuds because I thought they would make reception worse, but somehow it is better than my old headsets.They fit great too! I like to run, and they fit so snug I haven't had any problems with them - they stay put! And the sound quality and volume is superb for wireless! Plus, the case is elegant and the perfect size!

"For me, finding headphones/earbuds is a difficult process because I have smaller ears than the avg person. I was hoping to find something more comfortable and less lengthy than apple airpods so these gave me hope with the silicone buds and no ""tail"", but these ended up having disadvantages in their own way. The earbud itself was largely sticking out of my ear (it's decently thick) but I'm assuming there's not much else they can do to make the product smaller. On another note, the silicone bud allowed these earbuds to be EXTREMELY noise cancelling. Like I'm not playing. I couldn't hear a thing from the outside world. So if you're into that and you're looking for a good price, these are perfect for you. You can also listen with just one earbud in so you can find a good balance of music and hearing. Unfortunately, because they made my ears feel uncomfortably plugged and didn't fit me just right, I had to return. I'm sure it's a great purchase for others regardless!",4,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"So far after many uses, I would say this is for the most part a great product.  That being said, I think the battery life could improve. I get maybe 2 close to full charges from the holder case until that needs charged again.  The ear pieces seem to hold up to 5-6 hours of use before needing a charge(acceptable to me).  The noise cancelling ability is in need of improvement.",4,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
In my first review I hadn't worn the buds yet. My daughter purchased a pair and loves them. they stay in her ears all day and work great. In my case the buds will not stay in my ears.

I still highly recommend them because they work great for so many people .,5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0

"Sound quality is a good bang for your buck. I use them in the gym regularly. 3-5 days per week, 1-2 hours each session and seeing as how I'm the guy drenched in sweat after every work out, it's been a struggle to find a snug pair of true wireless headphones at a reasonable cost. Lots of research done, wanted to wait until the pixel buds 2 dropped, needed a new pair of headphones stat due to me running through all of my old wired pairs from sweat. The battery is impressive, one full charge on your wireless charger should get you through the week, depending on how much you use them. The voice over when you vol. Up/down,skip or seek, is kind of annoying. Other than that I am happy with my purchase. They fit nice, have 3 diff sizes to whatever fits your ears best. They aren't overly loud but are loud enough to where I don't hear much other than my music. The fingerprint sensors are a little delayed, I find that's it's faster just to control vol.

These sound way better than the Echo Buds (far richer, fuller sound and good bass) and for half the price.  These don't have noise cancelling, but certainly doesn't detract from the sound quality.

I use them at work and at the gym at least 4 times a week for about 2 hours (at which time I have the volume almost max). The Bluetooth connectivity if simply amazing I have had no problems connect or it disconnect a single time that I have been using it. I also have Bluetooth in my car and when I pull my headphones out it connects right away and after I put them away it connects seamlessly back to my car.

"Honestly surprised at the feel and quality of these little earbuds. Honestly ive never ventured into this style, always wore sport earbuds that are wired together, but i like these already. Sound quality is good, came with 18month warranty,  charging straight out of the box, and synced immediately with my phone no problem. I Have a galaxy s9+. Will update after using them for a bit.",5,1,2020-10-5,1,0,1
"I only have one other (blutooth) earbuds to compare to - and i JUST OPENED THE PACKAGE, but MUST SAY,they are INFINATELY EASIER TO USE/SETUP --- AAND, CANNOT BELIEEVE, they actually STILL HAVE CHARGE TO START LISTENING, WITHIN SECONDS! ;)))))... I literally put them in my ears, didnt read NOTHING YET, and immediately paired w/my MacBookPro!! - the left bud just 'ran out of power' (after ~4 songs), but the other is STILL PLAYIN EXCELLENTLY (8 lonng songs later! l))...a FAR CRY from the (only) other Sharper Image buds Ive been using (also UNexpectedly rec'd Xmas 2019)...which took FOREVERR to figure out how to charge/CLOSE THE CASE! ;O & EVEN KNOW whether they were 'charged' enough, or i wasnt doing SUMthing right!! (ie. WEEKS! ;((...they're OK, but AS OF THIS FIRST HOUR, THESE BLOW THEM AWAYYY!!! ;))",4,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"I have owned this headphones for the last 6 months the audio quality is amazing, however is becoming an increasing annoyance, how quick battery levels drop, even if you leave them charging for a while they won't last 20 minutes. The industry wants us to ditch the old reliable headphone jack, but instead is selling us disposable headphones that won't last a year.",2,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
Exactly what I was looking for! I’ve recently started working out and needed wireless earbuds to connect to my indoor bike. For the price these are a great option. Easy to connect. Great sound. And they survive a sweaty workout. I also use them when mowing the yard and I can hear my podcast over the sound of the mower.,5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,1
"Very nice bluetooth earbuds. Pair easily with no issue. Operating them is simple. Sound quality is great overall. Battery life is as specified which is dope. Most of all, the are by far the most comfortable true wireless earbuds I've purchased.  Plenty of tip options so they should have a pair of tips that will work for you. I really like the brand as this is the first time I've tried them. Definitely recommend!",4,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"I ordered a set and the first set the case did not charge wirelessly on the wireless charger, any of them that I own. I use these daily to charge my phones, and to charge the charging case for a set of Tozo t10 earbuds that I own, which work great. I wanted the t6 because they have the touch feature where the t10 has a small button to press, which you end up pressing the earbud into your ear further..  I returned the first set for an exchange, got the second set in the mail, same exact thing... I cannot support this product. I specifically bought this for the wireless charging and on two different sets it didn't work. I even contacted Tozo, and they basically just said, ""sorry"". No offer to make things right, or to address the problem... So for that, 1 star.. too bad, didn't have any other issues with them...",1,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
I am very impressed with all aspect of product design. Lovely packaging and very easy to use with intuitive touch control. It fitted in my ear cavity perfectly. I used them during my fast walk as well as light jogging and do not even feel any weight or discomfort for my two hour outing. They also included ten additional ear tips for various sizes of ears. Performance is at same level at very high priced product at fraction of cost. Love it various different color of choices. I definitely recommend and is on my gift giving list for coming holidays.,5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,1
"I find the sound quality amazing and they are very comfortable, I wear them to go walking and they cancel sound out so well that I sometimes just put on the right one so I can hear what’s around me to be safe. I also got the cordless charging plate and I love it!I saw some bad reviews and decided to give them a try since they were so cheap and now I’m delighted that I did!",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"These headphones have a good sound quality and fit comfortably in my ear. They come with a lot of options for rubber tips that go in your ear. I usually dislike in-ear headphones so these were a pleasant surprise. I got them on a big sale thinking they'd be decent, and they exceeded my expectations. Easy, comfortable, and good quality!",5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"Returned this item. When I finally got them to fit in my ear correctly, I was not a fan. Sound quality was great, but the noise cancellation was not good for running. I did a practice jog around my living room and could hear every step in my head. Perfect if that’s what you are looking for, but since I’ll use them primarily for running, they do not work for me.",3,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"Great battery life, they got prefect in my ears and come with several size options of ease buds. They look really sharp and they stay put even while jogging. I've not had to readjust them yet. The ""touch"" corolla on the ear pods are a little sensitive at times. They pair very easily and quickly with my phone and sound really good, not great but very good. The noise canceling feature works really well also.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"Sound quality is great, but you will have to push these back in place every 30 sec to fit snugly. Then they slightly slip out and the sound quality drops off sharply. I have tried all 5 of the included sizes of plugs and none stay in place well. I think this is due to the fact that the buds are designed so that the bulky plastic part is hanging above and out of the ear canal, so the weight of it simply tugs the buds out of place constantly.Really infuriating because the sound quality is great when pushed snug, but they don't stay that way. Annoying enough that I will be purchasing something else.",2,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"When they worked the head phones are great! Awesome sound quality, easy to use, unfortunately 1 month into having them the left earbud quit working and wouldn't play sound. I tried resetting and disconnecting and reconnecting and followed the trouble shooting directions, unfortunately none of the  trouble shooting fixed the problem.",2,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"These little earbuds are all of that and some. They pair very easily to any phone. I initially purchased these for my grandson's 10th birthday. 🎁. He has an iphone 7 and he loves them. I was so impressed until I purchased another pair for my son who has an iphone 10. He loves these little beauties as well.  I am also, considering getting another pair for myself..... Great purchase for the money. My son has had two pair of airpods and these run circles around those over priced airpods.....",5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
Buds are very comfortable and stay in ears well when walking and jogging.  Great bluetooth range.  Charging case is small with rounded edges to fit comfortably in pocket. Magnets grab the buds securely in place in the case. The lid is also held shut by a magnet.  Over 5 hrs on a charge.  Really like that you can use one bud at a time. Touch controls are very responsive and easy to use.  Very happy with the purchase...would definitely buy again.,5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"These are amazing, they paired easily, sound great, are very comfortable (can’t stand hard plastic AirPods) the price is great and even on the roughest sections of bike ride didn’t fallout. The touch controls have a leaning curve, simple but take a little practice. The call feature and advance song feature are great on the Tozo 6 too. I highly recommend them!",5,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"For the price, these buds are pretty good. However, they are WEIRD in water. I bought them for when I shower.  I like to listen to music when I shower, but sometimes it's too loud for those around me, so I thought these would be a good compromise. No dice. I suppose the warm water makes them go crazy cause the volume would shift up or down or my music would pause unexpectedly. Needless to say, I was disappointed. Otherwise, I liked them.",4,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"I was skeptical about these or any other earbuds and their talk time.  I have not used them extensively but knowing that I can use them one at a time or both at the same time is a great option.  Getting them out of the case can get a little tricky but once out, they pair quickly. Have to get used to the touch part and how many times to tap, but that is expected. Talk and sound quality are top notch.",4,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0
"Just got these today so haven't got much to say good or bad. But one thing I've noticed after connecting to my firestick. The Bluetooth connection seems weak, I'm within then 8 feet from the TV and it cuts out at points, especially if I'm laying on my side. Not sure how stable the connection is with my phone as I specifically bought these to watch TV without disturbing others. The noise canceling is ok. I'd prefer more bass but it's better than most buds I've used. Overall I'm pretty satisfied.",4,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"The sound is good and the comfort is fine. They just have a problem staying in my ears . I was really hoping to get rid of the cords when I run on the treadmill,  but these can't seem to take the movement and just bounce out after a few moments.  I think I can wear them while walking around so I will probably keep them.  Oh well,  I  guess I will just have to get the ones with the clips around the ears or something.",4,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"-I just bought these and they sound great.  They’re not super comfortable, but maybe I just have narrow ear canals.-update: Yeah, sound good and still not too comfy, but I can’t really hold that against the product, since I knew of the in-ear design prior to purchase.  The main issue I have is the connection strength.  When in use, if I move in a certain direction or too quickly, the connection emits static in my ear.  That’s not something that happens with my Beats or AirPods.  So, they’re great if you’re planning on sitting still.  The whole point though is to avoid wires and limits to mobility.  I kinda have to lower the rating, significantly.",1,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"Okay so real talk I purchased 3 way more expensive ear buds before I bought these and these have been the only ones that don't hurt my little ears. I have to wear ear buds for 6 hours at work everyday and these don't hurt at all. Also, I had an issue with the earbuds at first but the Tozo customer service was quick in helping me get my issue resolved. Great earbuds at a good price with quick customer service. Ya can't beat that.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"Nice pair of wireless Buds. The sound was pretty amazing coming from such a small device. I wish battery life was longer but i guess you can put much more battery in such a small space. The case has wireless charging which is nice I just throw the back on my charger and it charges without having to plug them in. The customer support was very helpful and wanted to make sure I was !00"" satisfied.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
I bought these as a replacement for the AirPods that I accidentally put through the the wash (D’oh). I did my research first to find out what features and highlights I wanted in my new earbuds and these hit most if not all of them. The sound quality is great and the noise cancellation is excellent.I still haven’t quite gotten a hang of the controls because they’re not as intuitive as they could be but I’ll get there! Great product. I’ve already recommended them to some friends looking for similar.,5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"Typically skeptical on reviews but read the ones one these earbuds and bought them. They have a good build, great sound, really nice highs, and lows. Fit my ears great (cannot use apple earbuds, design hurts my ears immediately). Comes with extra end pieces and the fact that they are waterproof is a big plus, getting caught running in the rain happens. Noise-canceling is also pretty impressive. I'd recommend these to anyone.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
Don't bother with the more expensive stuff! This is all you need! They sound excellent and hold an extremely long charge. The size of the charger is convenient! So much so that I forget it's even on me. I misplaced one of my earbuds and contacted the company. They responded back to me within 24 hours and provided a solution that I was happy with. You so not get this kind of quality or customer service with the bigger brands!!,5,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0
"Just received my Tozo T6 earbuds, and I am blown away.  The sound quality is absolutely amazing!  I have tried different earbuds in the past, and the sound on these is so much better.  I especially love the bass!  They are easy to use and paired easily with my iPhone.  The noise cancellation is an added bonus, so I can block out the world and enjoy my music.  These truly wireless earbuds are made of high quality material, and are worth more than the listed price.  I would have gladly paid double.  Definitely give these a try.  You will not be disappointed!",5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0

"After researched buds and was satisfied with the reviews of these buds. They were ready to go as soon as they arrived. Pairing was easy peasy, I'm not sure what to expect for battery but ok so far. I haven't paired with another device only main mobile. Sound is good, callers had said they can hear me really clearly.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
Sound very good!  Linked to my phone by bluetooth very easily..... AND WITH ALEXA!!! easier than I thought.  Looks cool too.  I do find myself messing up by touching the controls which adjusting fit.  I have got to get better at that.,5,1,2020-1-14,1,1,0
"I've had these about 4-5 months.  I've used them while mowing the lawn and other outside work. I've also used them while flying and traveling.  They have worked well. Connection was easy, sound quality was fine, and my mic quality was fine.The con for me, is the battery life.  I currently only get about 20-30 minutes of working time.  So, not quite long enough to be usable anymore.  I would want at least an hour minimum.  When I first got them the battery life seemed to be pretty long.",2,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
"I had the 1st apple airpods and tozo T6, and i can say these are honestly better than the airpods. Great noise cancellation, especially in my loud mouthed grade school cafeteria sounding office, and I havent charged them in over a week so the battery life is pretty awesome. I use them mostly at work for noise cancellation and theyre great for working out at the gym. Im not sure if theyre waterproof but they stay in your ear pretty well during workouts. They have a comfortable fit and the sound is really good as well. Im still getting used to the touch-gestures. These are great for ignoring people.",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"Tozo did great with the T6. I love these. Even without considering the price difference I prefer them to AirPods. Very comfortable and excellent sound for the cost. I can run with them and rarely need to adjust. A solid seal is key to best sound quality though! I often only use one at a time so I can hear my surroundings at work. I make it through a twelve+ hour day with power to spare in the case and only rotate which bud I have in once or twice depending on if I’m listening to music or podcasts.If you’re on the fence, go for it. The price is incredible for these bad boys.",5,1,2020-5-10,1,0,0
"Awesome pair of headphones! These are slightly bigger than the air pod case and fit in my pocket just fine. I use them all the time, sitting at my desk at work, running, doing situps, anything. They stay in your ear. The only problem that i had was they were too loud, but that was a problem with the Samsung phone i was using and not with the headphones. If you adjust the volume on the pods they have thier own volume control seperate from your phones volume control. Once i figured that out, 5 stars! Ive been using these almost daily since i bought them",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"These earbuds work very well. I was listening to music with the earbuds and my cell phone. A call came in, and I was able to speak to the caller, who could not hear the music, although I could. Is there a way to turn off music in a case like this? Unfortunately, one bud fell out of my ear, and I have not found it yet.",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
So so perfect! I have never been a fan of ear buds but these are AMAZING! They come with different sized nubbies for different ear shapes. The charger is super compact. Shipped was amazing I got them in less than 24 hours. I can’t wait to take these to France with me! I haven’t really tested the battery life but with the noise cancelation my co-workers have to literally text me. It’s also nice to answer work calls from my Iphone with with them. They’re comfortable and powerful. My co-worker said he couldn’t hear them at full blast. 100% recommend the only think I would as is to find the touch controls online. Luckily I just kinda figured them out!,5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"These work great, the sound is good, and they last days without charging.  I'm very happy with these earbuds.  I wear them to the gym, on my bike, working outside, and at work and they always cancel out background noise so I can focus on the task at hand.  They may work too well- I often get startled by unnoticed visitors.",5,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0

"Great wireless earbuds for the price. Pairs right away to phone and to the second earbud as well. The bass on them are great, helps block out the noise around me while I'm at the gym. I would recommend these earbuds to anyone who is in need of a good inexpensive pair. I have yet to test the battery life but the fact that the carrying case charges your earbuds when they're not in use makes them last quite some time.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"These earbuds were a Father's Day present for my husband.  The left one would not recharge after the first time.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice that they had such a small return window when I purchased them, and since I bought them a week early in order to have enough delivery time for them to arrive, there were only a couple of weeks left on the return policy, and I can't return them.  Only companies who know their products are garbage have return policies of 30 days.",1,1,2020-7-26,1,0,0
"Great product. Couldn’t be easier to get started with. My concern was I’d they would stay in my ears and they do. The fact that you get an entire wardrobe of covers in different sizes helped me make the decision that this was the Bluetooth earbud option for me.  Easy to operate with just a touch, moving forward, backward in playlists, talking to digital assistant and dealing with phone calls. My voice was easily heard by those I’ve been on phone with.",5,1,2020-4-7,1,0,0
"I really like these earbuds. In the week I’ve had them I haven’t had any issues with them falling out — which was a big concern of mine as these were my first pair of wireless earbuds. I have been able to jog with them in and have them not fall out, and it’s really helpful that you can use one at a time. Battery life is about 4 hours which I think is pretty impressive. The range from the phone is about the average Bluetooth range — I was able to go upstairs and downstairs with no issues in connection. In the week I’ve had these , I’ve lost connection about 4 times total and I’ve used them every day for at least 5 hours so I’d say that’s pretty good.Last but not least the quality of the sound and noise cancellation is very good. I haven’t noticed a huge difference between these and my beats earbuds.",4,1,2020-6-22,1,0,1
"These ear buds are great! I purchase the rose gold to match my Apple Watch. Ear buds are easy to sync with a iPhone XR.I have small ears and with the smallest silicone cover they fit perfectly in my ear! Sound is a great quality, noise cancellation works great! I definitely recommend you purchase.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
"Overall product quality is good. Sound quality and noise cancellation are good. As a wireless headset for listening to music it has good sound quality but not as good as my Bose. It is missing some phone functionality when taking calls, primarily mute and volume control. for these you have to have your phone in your hand. Not as functional as my Plantronics headset.",4,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"After using these for a day I am fairly impressed (the price helps). If you are looking for audiophile-grade earbuds, go elsewhere, but if you are looking for good sound for listening to music or podcasts while working or relaxing on the patio, these are more than adequate. I am not a fan of using them for phone conversations (talking with headphone on), but they do work well.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
Finally decided to get a set of these and I’m so glad I did! I really appreciate that there are 6 different ear plug sizes. I tried the 2nd smallest and it hurt after a bit and then tried the smallest size and was shocked by the noise cancelling ability and how much better it felt on my little ear canals. I’ll be recommending these to all my coworkers who are now also teleworking. Well worth the money to no longer be tethered to mh phone.,5,1,2020-3-24,1,0,0
"Bought the T6 for my son after I was impressed for the T10 model.  With the T6, besides Pausing,  you can adjust volume,  rewind or fastforward. Great when you are working out . Not having to take out my phone everytime I want to skip a song or adjust the volume... Battery life is very good and the plugs are very well made. I use wireless charging for convenience. I am happy with this purchase and so is my son.",5,1,2019-9-26,1,0,1
"I was looking for a while for a pair of wireless earbuds without costing a fortune. I think I have found the best value out there. These Tozo buds are great. The sound and bass are beyond expectation. I love the features - touch functions, small portable case with extended charging, easy one step pairing to multiple devices. You can beat the value you get when purchasing these ear buds. Highly recommend.",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
Bought these for my daughter for Christmas.  The right side died and will no longer charge after four months of use.  Do not recommend.Edit:  The charger was not working on one side; Tozo replaced the unit and the new one works fine.  Updated the rating according to great customer service.,4,1,2020-4-27,1,1,0
"My first pair of wireless earbuds. I was a little reluctant, thinking to myself, ""how good can they really be for @ $40?"".  I have to say that I am impressed with the quality of these earbuds!  For the price, I don't understand why anyone would spend hundreds of dollars on a pair.  They sound fantastic, IMO.  Better than the over the ear headphones I've been wearing.",5,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"Most importantly, Tozo customer service is literally the BEST! These are amazing ear buds and quite affordable. If your product isn’t everything that you expect and more, trust me that Tozo will make it right! I wear these in the shower, at work and around the house. Long lasting charge and ease of use are outstanding.",5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
Received these headphones as a Christmas gift. They have great sound quality and are easy to use. They touch interface works great. They are comfortable and light when wearing them. Most impressive of all is the battery life on both the base and the headphones; it will easily last all day. One headphone can last well over five hours on a single charge. Also worth noting is the incredible customer service I have received since registering for the warranty. Just a great product from a great company.,5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,1
"This product delivers excellent value.  FIt options are excellent.  I like the way the buds fit and stay in my ears.  The sound quality is excellent, better than I expected at this price.  The bass is quite good without being unbalanced or excessive.  They offer good sound isolation, so despite not being noise cancelling headphones, they do offer pretty good isolated privacy if you want that.",5,1,2019-11-16,1,0,1
"I don't know why I didn't purchase these long ago! I was using the cheap wire ones. After quite some research, I went with the Tozo T6 since I like the touch control option to forward, reverse, and pause music (or answer phone calls). The sound quality is pretty good and they look damn cool on. The case is soft and smooth, and the earbuds come with replacement eartips in different sizes, so you can choose which one will fit you best. I've had these for a few days now and so far, so good! They come with an extended 18-month warranty so that gives me a peace of mind. Plus, you can't beat the price for these great quality earbuds (I'm a cheap @$$ when it comes to purchasing electronics, these are legit).",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"It's a good product, but not as good as most reviews claim. The battery life is about 2 hours for each charge, the battery pack can charge the earbuds 3 times, so total playable time is about 6 hours. The sound quality is not as good as my $30 headphone, you have to push it all the way into your ear in order to hear some bass. But that also makes you feel like the sound comes from a jar, and not comfortable either. So I usually loose it a little bit, and the bass drops considerably.",4,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
"I don't often write reviews, but these earbuds are really something else! I wasn't expecting them to be as wonderful as everyone else said they were, but I was pleasantly surprised. They are light on your ears, but not so light that you would notice if one fell out. The sound is perfect for listening to books, or music, or lectures. I have listened to rock, EDM, pop, classical, ambient, and they all sound phenomenal for this price range - maybe even giving more expensive ear buds a run for their money. Battery life is superb. I have been listening for 2 weeks for about 4 hours a day, and only had to recharge the case once. I am impressed, and plan to get another set for my dad who borrowed mine and loved them.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"Wow! Just wow! Those who gave below 4 stars must be crazy or have gotten defects, because this product is truly something. I'm usually skeptical about ""bang for your buck"" products but I decided to give this a shot. Just. WOW. The sound quality is tremendous, extremely clear with just enough bass in my opinion. Noise isolation is superb, any noise I would usually find loud or distracting was completely gone while wearing these, and not even over half volume! The quality of build is fantastic, although I expected the case to be a bit glossier judging by the picture. The only qualm I have with this product is that the touch controls are delayed by a second, but as someone who uses this as simple everyday music, I could care less. The value is amazing for this premium quality. Buy it!",5,1,2020-3-12,1,0,1
"I spent a lot of time reading reviews for decent earbuds, as I was not willing to spend a large sum of money at this time for such item.  I am so glad I took the chance on the TOZO T6.  I LOVE THEM!  Great sound quality, nice base and noise canceling.  Though I read  many great reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect for $50.  I must say, I am quite impressed.  They are easy to pair, very convenient touch functions and they fit comfortably in my ears and do not fall out.  (It's also great they come with 4 different bud sizes).  Works great in the shower and while working out.  I highly recommend this product.  You won't be disappointed.",5,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
"Don't like that when you first put devices in your ears, or adjust for fit, they think you're giving commands and take actions that are unintended.

"Had a pair of the T10s.  Loved them.  Only negative thing about them was the case was a little large for my pocket.  Saw the T6s and immediately ordered a pair.  They sound is as good as the T10s.  The T6s added volume control the T10s didn't have, so that is nice.  I've had to learn to be more deliberate on where I touch the T6s since the new interface is touch sensitive instead of a button like  No regrets on upgrading to the T6s.",5,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"I had a problem with the earbuds and let them know. They sent out new ones right away. When the new ones came, my wife was able to troubleshoot the issue with the old ones. I offered to pay for the replacements and was told no worries. The quality seems very good to me for the price. I didn’t want to spend a whole lot. I am very happy with the company and the product.",5,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
"I have wanted  wireless earbuds for a long time, but did not want to pay $200.00. I took a chance and purchased these. Have used them from a couple of weeks and continue to be surprised at the quality sound, the ability to wear them on a noisy road and still hear a phone conversation, and the ease of pairing.  I bought my husband the Beats wireless . I am just as happy with these earbuds, particularly the ease of pairing. I take them out of the charging case and they are paired. There are a number of control possibility with the touch of the finger on your right or left earbud. The mode is identified with a voice. f I lose them, I am only out $40.00.

"I bought this product so that I could do virtual workouts and be able to hear what trainers were saying as device sound wasn't all that great. I have always had problems with keeping earbuds in my ears, which really seems to be my major issue with these. I have tried all of the sizes and still have a slight issue with them staying in place. The only other issue I have had is that when my phone is in my pocket (well in the range it should be) my sound will randomly cut out for a few seconds, especially if I am doing something like walking. That is more mildly annoying than anything else. However, even with those issues, this product does exactly what I need it to do. And was way cheaper than buying a samsung or apple version. So definitely worth the price in my opinion!",4,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"These earbuds were everything I was looking for. The sound quality is fantastic, even when jogging. They require no effort to easily pair to my phone or laptop. They are in a compact case, and charge quickly with a long battery life, both separately and even more with the case. They excel at noise cancellation, and when I need to be aware of my surroundings, I can just wear one. The only downside is that they are very heavy. Wearing them for an extended period of time does not feel good. But for an hour or so, for me, they're fine. However with regard to comfort, YMMV, I'm sure that's entirely personal.",4,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
"I was really worried about earbuds falling out while running. My previous earbuds have fallen out, even with the ear hook things—I thought I had a weird ear that wouldn’t work with anything other than expensive apple products. However, I just ran a quick 5K in a hilly neighborhood with lots of wind and the earbuds stayed in perfectly. I didn’t even think once about them falling out or needing to readjust them. For the price and the fit... great product!",5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"These are the best headphones I've ever purchased and probably the best technology I've ever purchased in my life. The sound quality is unbelievable, I never thought such little earbuds would have such great bass and sound. They are convenient to use, they stay in my ears at work and turning them off and on is easy and really cool. I always have to worry about headphones falling out at work or at the gym, but with these, I basically forgot they were in my ears. Didn't have to adjust them once, even when I was doing sprints! Charging is also convenient and neat as well. I never thought I'd own such a cool and great piece of technology. I never want to take them out, 11/10 product.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"I am not one to write a negative review at all, if I am not very pleased with the product I just let the star rating speak for itself. But these really did disappoint. They didn’t stay in my ears when I was just walking through the park. Their touch response lagged a little bit for my liking, and the voice on them seemed very slow and drowned out. I would def look elsewhere.",2,1,2020-5-26,1,0,1
"I really  love my T6 Earbuds. For me the features for price can not be beaten. Great sound quality, easy to pair with my phone and they fit great in my ear. I enjoy that I can use each earbud in mono mode, one ear at a time. I work on a night shift and I can listen to music none stop without the need to recharge.

"I've been a fan of earbuds for at least 7 years. Never have I ever experienced the wet mildew smell I am experiencing with these earbuds. I don't know what is going on. I keep my ears clean and even if I didn't, they don't smell like a wet mildewed piece of clothing and I can't remove that smell!! I gave the overall rating three stars because of that smell. I can't stand anything that smells bad! I am now shopping for new earbuds.PS: The battery life on these is excellent!",4,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"These are wonderful earbuds. I've bought 3 other pairs, all from other manufacturers, trying to find the right ""fit"". All had their good points but none had everything I wanted: good sound, deep bass, stay in my ears without quicky slipping out, long play time on a charge, and decent price. These T-6's do it all. I'm giving the others away.",5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
I really love these ear buds. They came fast. They're loud and easy to install. I love them for when i go on bike rides. The sweat from my hair gets to them and they still work. I even showered with them and i had no issues. Battery life is great too. The command controls are simple and convenient. I recommend my friends and family these.,5,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
I really wanted to love this product. The price is great & reviews were convincing enough to give them a try. I even bought my husband a pair the day mine arrived.

"Purchased Jan 27, 2020. These worked really well for about six months of regular use. Solid for running, phone calls, listening to music at home. However, now left earbud is completely not working. I purchased Asurion extended warranty, but it doesn't come into play until Tozo's ends. Their website provides warranty registration but no follow-up email is received following registration (sketchy), and should you attempt to email the address their website directs you to (info@tozostore.com) you will receive an ""inbox full"" notification.

"First off this is the 4th different pair of wireless ear buds I have tried out in the last year. Obviously I have yet to find the right fit, sound quality and battery life, until now. These are perfect for me so far. This week I put them to the test hiking, running and they even stayed in place on the inversion table.  The battery life is great and I have yet to even run them out of battery life.  My ear holes dont hurt, like many buds, using them all day. Just do it these are awesome.",5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"Love these wireless earbuds!  I didn't want to shell out upwards of $200 for other similar options, and I'm glad I didn't.  I use these for running, teaching my fitness class via Zoom, house painting projects, and just around the house during quarantine so as not to disturb my partner.  I have small-ish ears and the smallest size nub works perfectly and keeps them comfortable after some trial and error with adjusting how they sit.  The right ear bud did mysteriously stop working after about two months, but after a short email exchange and trouble shooting with the manufacturer, they are replacing them so I'll be back up and running.  Definitely recommend.",5,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"These are my first pair of wireless headphones so its a bit of a biased review but these are amazing. The headphones pair up to each other as soon as you pull them outve their case.. connecting to my phone is very simple as just turning on the bluetoth option. I listen to my podcasts all day while at work and swap from earbud to earbud  once in a while to have enough juice for the commute home. Yestreday afternoon i let one die thinking it'd be a quick charge for atleast for the commute home but the dead earbud wouldnt turn on or connect until it was FULLY charged.

Love these ear buds! Went from using some other brands off and on for over a year at work. Being a mechanic the shops loud constantly and my old ear buds just didn't cut it. These on day one put a smile on my face being able to here my favorite jams loud and clear all day long. Will be purchasing a set for my wife.,5,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"After very little usage, the charging case has stopped charging on one side. This is massively inconvenient, because who only uses 1 earbud? Now whenever I want to use them I have to wait for one side to finish charging, then open the case, switch the earbuds, and wait for the other side to charge. Would not recommend. I’ve had these for a month, and used them maybe a total of 10 times.",1,1,2020-5-20,1,1,0
"They do not stay in my ears no matter what, so I have to wear a headband to keep them in and then when I sweat it activates the volume so they turn way down or it just repeats ""maximum voluuuuume"" over and over again!!! and the maximum volume is for sure NOT loud enough to drown out the grunts and heavy breathing at the gym.

"I just recieved these, and so far I love them. The noise cancelation and sound quality are amazing. I got the Rose Gold ones, and they are so pretty.

Just received these today but so far I am very impressed with their build quality and sound quality. For the price they are as good as my former Samsung earbuds that cost $145 😳.

"I planned on using these in sporting circumstances, like on my daily runs. I put them in to take my dog for a walk but they would not stay in my ears. To keep them from falling out, I would push them back into the ear canal but while doing that it would pause the song or skip to the beginning or to the end of the song. I tried all the different ear headphone tip sizes but none solved the problem.  Sound was great, but would not fit my sporting needs.",2,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0

"I am the kind of person that digs through all the reviews until I can find a negative one for contrast. I found one review that gave 2 stars that said poor sound quality. That review is not correct at all in my opinion. I have a $1,500 sound system in my car and enjoy great sound quality. These are not as good as my car, but they still have fantastic sound! I was very surprised and impressed with the overall quality based on the price.I had the Beats Pro Bluetooth headphones before these and they broke twice. After the second replacement I knew I needed to try something else. I have only had them for a couple weeks but they are better than the Beats in every way. I strongly suggest everyone to buy these and give them a chance. If you're like me and have a hard time trusting a brand name you don't know, give them a shot.",5,1,2019-12-7,1,0,1
"These work perfectly for working out at the gym and fit great under my motorcycle helmet, though they do get pulled out of my ears when taking the helmet off (At least with my Bilt modular one, orher models may not?), but they're easy enough to sort of catch inside the helmet by leaning forward.

"These headphones are great in the all the normal ways that you would normally judge headphones, but there are also a lot of other little things that make these headphones even better.  The size of the charging case is small enough to carry in your pocket without taking up too much space.  The charging case optionally charges wirelessly.

"After getting annoyed with my wired blue tooth headset, I decided to try these. I just got them and took them for a spin. I must admit the sound quality is better than I thought.

"These earbuds looked super cool and definitely worth it for the price. The noise cancellation is really good, whenever I listen to music I can barely hear the outside.  The music quality is INSANE good, I also like that they are bass boosted, really improves the music. I will definitely buy dozens of these if I had the money for it. When I open the box, its really cool that they got the little envelope like apple does for there products when you open them, it makes you think they are really special earbuds. These are way cheaper than airpods and way better for the price.",5,1,2020-2-12,1,1,1
I love the sound quality on these earpieces.  I have especially been impressed when taking a phone call.  The person on the other end of the call can hear me perfectly and outside noises are not picked up.  I was struggling to get the earpieces (left ear especially) to stay in my ear while doing things.  I knew there were more ear piece attachments (in sizes) but hadn’t realized there was one even smaller than I had been using.  Trying that size out today and so far it is going much better.  I wanted an earpiece that I could listen to music on while working around the house but also be able to talk on the phone while getting things done.  This ear piece lets me accomplish all of that.,4,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
Neat little package. I like the idea of seeing the charge indicators outside the case. The case is easy to open and the earbuds are easy to get out unlike some others that I've had. Don't know about the longevity which has been a problem with some other earbuds that I've purchased. I'll let you know in a month or two.,5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"I am very particular about the bass quality and these things are outstanding. The headphones also connect very well on Bluetooth.  I LOVE the wireless charging feature, and this is very convenient as I can just set it on a Q charger on my bedside table. I have another TOZO product that has a larger case, but I think this one is better because of the smaller size which is slightly bigger than a box of dental floss. So far, the battery life is good.  The touch earbuds seem to provide limited functions, but they work well and the quality is good. Packaged very well and impressive if you wanted to give this product as a gift.  I sweat a lot when I'm exercising, and the waterproof feature is a good thing to have in headphones. Overall, I like them and these are a great value when compared to other ear pods.",5,1,2019-9-29,1,0,0
They seem to stay in my ears. Haven’t had long enough to know for sure but so far so good.  Still trying to figure out touch system for volume up and down. Pretty good sound quality.

"First I really like how long the battery lasts as it lasts for at least 8 hours and probably more, since I never have used them till their dead I wouldn't know the exact battery life. My favorite part of these are their ease of use and the hour of charge time the battery case itself needs. With it's quick charge time and long lasting battery it fits perfectly into my go go life style.",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"I used the product a handful of times, bought both the Tozo T10 and Tozo T6. After maybe 15-20 times of use over the course of 5 months (used as a backup pair to my main bluetooth headphones), the T6 have already lost the ability to last more than 30 mins without dying. I have even let them completely lose all power before charging in hopes that they would regain some longer term function, but to no avail. They look great and were a decent deal, but apparently this is why they are so cheap. Do not recommend unless you plan on throwing them in the charger every 30 mins.",1,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0

I got these b/c they are waterproof - haven't gotten them wet yet, but as with the T10s, they sound really great and are comfortable to wear. I also have a charging pad making it easy to keep both fully charged. To me the sound is a good balance - decent bass and depth for both music and listening to podcasts. And Tozo support has been great to deal with. One of the T10s had an issue - they were super responsive, quickly walked me thru troubleshooting, and ended up shipping a replacement quickly. Good company to deal with. (Photo shows T6 on the charging pad with T10s in the background.)",5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,1

I refuse to buy expensive ear buds--like pricey sunglasses. The more you pay the better chance to lose or damage. These T6's are excellent for the price.

"Update to below: The company reached out to compensate me with a gift card or replacement earbuds. I opted for the gift card and appreciate the customer service.Product itself is fine, but the headphones constantly remain on in the case and drain battery. If I take them for the charger and bring them to work/travel, etc, they drain all the battery by the time I get to use them. They’re supposed to remain off in the case and turn on once out. I have disconnected them from my Bluetooth when not using so it’s not the issue. They’re not designed properly to recognize that they should be off in the case. Would not purchase again",2,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0

Used them on a two hour flight non stop with no interruptions or dead battery. Overall great product for the price.",4,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0

"Amazing buy. Have used every day since I received. I use one side and it lasts over 7 hours. Otherside still in charging case just in case, but I've not needed it. I wear both in the gym.

I just received my earbuds. I think they work really well my only complaint is that everytime I touch them while in my ear they change whatever I am listening to. They are still fairly new so I am sure I will learn not to touch them while in my ear. Also I needed a smaller cover for the ear piece. It came with covers but they were still too big. Overall worth the money and good quality.,4,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0

Great product, fast shipping, I am pleased with my purchase! I use to calls, audiobooks and music with no problem!!!",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"I was looking for a good pair of compact bluetooth earbuds, and whilst I was originally terrified of buds without wires, I wish I tried these sooner, they are amazing and I love that the case charges them, so I can always easily and readily have them whenever I need them.  If you don't have a wireless charging case however, you will need to pry open the bottom of the case to use the charging cable it comes with. I was skeptical whilst reading reviews as I didn't have a wireless charger, but with the cord I didn't find it nearly as difficult as some reviews made it seem. Overall a fantastic product! The cords is also a standard micro usb, so you can use any of your old cables if you find the cord it comes with too short.",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,1
"These wireless headphones are incredible, especially if you’re looking to cut the cord without splashing large amounts of cash on other wireless headphones. The look of the case and size are extremely convenient if you always find yourself on the move. The battery life is astounding considering that I only have to charge the case whenever I get home rather than sporadic moments throughout my day. The sound quality is up there and connecting to devices is extremely simple and quick. The controls are also easy to understand and extremely responsive. The noise cancellation is enough for me since I can only be unaware of my surroundings for so long. I was unsure on whether the product was too good to be true, especially when considering the price point, but this has to be the best pair of wireless headphones I’ve purchased especially on a budget. I can’t wait to see what other exciting models they have in store for the future!",5,1,2019-12-8,1,0,0
"I've had these since about November 2019. I've really enjoyed them a lot. I use them for exercise and work. The sound is crisp and clear. I had a small issue with one of the earbuds but customer service resolved it right away. While I didn't know this brand before, I think I'll be relying on Tozo earbuds for some time to come.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
Bought these as alternative to the AirPods these are just as great my daughter shared AirPods but she’s 11 and i did not want to spend so much on something I feel she is not responsible enough to take care of so I went with these and they are great quality and we got the link ones she loves them! I will be buying a pair for myself 😁,5,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"These are really nice earbuds overall. My only real complaint is that the stem on them is a little long, so they don't quite fit all the way in my ear the way they're supposed to (the body doesn't fit flush against my ear), but they still stay in securely. Otherwise, they sound really good, the case is compact and filled with features (the wireless charging is probably my favorite), and the software driving the earbuds is nice.",5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"Best headphones I’ve used so far.  Secure and loud enough for work and use with power tools.  Call quality is goo, except certain sounds come across to others very loudly.  My only gripe so far is that they don’t always turn off when placed in the case, so my phone will stay connected until I turn off Bluetooth.  Not too big of a deal.",5,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
"Good battery life.  I have had inconsistent results trying to turn these off over the last four months, so I result to unpairing almost every time I'm finished listening.  The fit is ok, but the sound quality is good.  Kind of a pain when the they wiggle loose enough during workouts to allow sweat inside the ear.",4,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
I bought these headphones because I had orginally bought the T10 headphones and absolutely fell in love with them. So when I seen the T6 headphones and the features I had to go an buy a pair as well. So many people have liked them or complimented me on them. I even bought my mother a pair she liked them so much.  The Tozo customer service is top notch. I asked for extra small ear caps and they responded in a timely manner and shipped 2 sets out for me right away. I couldnt say anymore positive things about these headphones and the company. They sound great to. They pair easily with my galaxy phone. You can use just one at a time if you like.  The case has a battery built in so when u put the headphones in them they charge up so everytime you are ready to use them they are ready to go everytime. Thank you tozo for making a great product and also for standing behind the name. Sincerely 1 Happy customer.,5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,1
This is my second pair of the TOZO wireless ear buds. The sound quality and clarity is amazing and the battery life is excellent. The connection with my iPhone is solid and conversations are clear. My wife has my old pair and loves them as well. For the money these cannot be beat. I highly recommend.,5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"I’m really impressed so far! Very easy to get them going... Paired quickly, the taps and holds work well. I might have to play with the tips a bit as they do not feel snug enough to stay put during a run. I tested the phone functions, music and games, all of which worked great. Also curious to try in water/ rain. Very pleased with my purchase.",4,1,2020-6-24,1,0,1
Great buds. Sound is good for the price. The extra 2 hours of battery life above the previous model is great. RecommendedUpdate: The bass range leaves much to be desired. If you like to listen to audio books or music that is not bass heavy these are good. Not good for gaming though. Way too tinny and does not have the necessary audio range.,5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"I had the previous version (T10) and these are better! Longer battery life, smaller and more convenient travel case, and touch functions so that I don't have to push the earbud uncomfortably into my ear like the last ones. The bass is still great, I tried various bass heavy songs just to make sure. They fit snugly into my tiny ears and passed my headbang test. There are different sizes of earbuds if your ear canals are not as small as mine :). Would recommend!",5,1,2019-10-30,1,0,1
I'll admit I'm impressed.I selected this earbud because the price was very competitive and it was the Amazon choice so I figured I'd give it a try.,5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"Very satisfied so far with this product. Pairing was simple straight out of the box. When choosing to use only one earbud, removing either one pairs it right away, and if you then want to use both and remove the second one it pairs quickly as well. Sound quality is very good, and the snug fit eliminates most outside noise. Battery life is more than adequate for my use, and while it is is not as long as some other products, it seems to be a significant improvement from the previous generation product.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
I use these with my Galaxy S9+.  Pairing was easy and the less than perfect English didn’t bother me.  Good sound quality.  Fit well though I haven’t tried other size covers yet to see if they fit better.  I don’t use them for long periods so I don’t have any battery life concerns though I have only charged them once so far.  I really like the wireless charging.,5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"Original post:  Just got these today and the set up was easy, they feel comfortable, the sounds is good, and the commands are simple to operate.  I'll post more as I get used to them.Update:  I need these earbuds for hands-free, two-way communication and the person on the other end of the call hears everything magnified.  It actually hurt one person's ears when I turned on the sink.  I had to end another call when I was walking outside because of too much noise interference.  It looks like I'm going to have to return these.  I am so disappointed because everything about them was so easy breezy that I want to keep them.  But, I need to find something more suitable for the two-way communication.",1,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
"Apple's headphone design actually hurts my ear cavity to use them. These fit so comfortably, that I can keep them in for hours and not feel any pain. They stay in fairly well during workouts. Once I adjusted the EQ on my phone for small speakers, the bass sounded much better. Overall, totally worth the money. The wireless charging is great!",5,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0
In the short time I have had the Tozo T6’s they have lived up to the reviews I have read. I was debating the T6 or the T12 and I am glad I chose the T6. The fit is perfect since you get multiple size cushions and the sound amazing with nice deep base. The overall quality is on point and I feel like I purchased $200 earbuds for a third of the price. Listen to the reviews like I did and pick up a set of these T6’s.,5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,1
"Just as good as the Samsung ones. Good sound, good bass, good battery life. Easy to pair, stereo doesn't get out of sync between ears. Can even use just one (controls don't work if you don't have it out of the case though). Waterproof works even when covered in dust. Price is too low for what you get!.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
So far I like the earbuds. I only wish they were a little louder. I haven’t had them that long so I’m not sure how the battery life in them is just yet but I can update later as I have more info.UPDATE: my left earbud keeps going in and out even after being cleaned and charged. Losing my confidence in these...,5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0

"Mediocre sound quality, great product otherwise. Hats off the the engineers who took the time to implement the little things like either ear bud being independent and master (can use either by itself). Battery life is fantastic. Build quality is fantastic. I have other wireless earbuds that a generic from China, half the price, and far better sound quality.",4,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
"This is an Absolutely great product. It has amazing sound quality, and amazing noise canceling. Better than any headphones I’ve ever had.

It has amazing sound quality, and amazing noise canceling.They also have amazing customer service as well!",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"I think my favorite part about these headphones is their long battery life. I only charge them about once a week even though I use them daily for a couple hours. I also really like that they fit into my ear so easily and are very snug, so I never have to worry about them coming out when going on a run. In terms of sound quality, I tried my dad's airpods and found them comparable which makes me pretty happy given the price point. When I did have an issue with the product, I was pleased to see a prompt response from customer service. Overall I'm pretty happy with this product and recommended it to my sister.",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"These have really great sound quality, do great on calls and I love the pink color of the rose gold. I'd been considering a fancy brand name option and tried these on a friend's recommendation -- and I'm SO glad I did. Really impressed with these, and I love how they have the different sizes of the pads to go around the earbuds!",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
Honestly wasn’t expecting such good sound and bass to come out of these. I love making music and kinda can gauge what’s off and on about sound quality and I can say these definitely give 0 issues. Absolutely love and I recently broke one and they replied super fast with a solution for me and I’m super happy and great full for the service they provide as well. Definitely keeping these for as long as I can,5,1,2020-9-29,1,1,0
"I am returning these ear phones.  I can't get them to seat properly in my ear and stay there.  This means that I have to regularly adjust them to keep them from falling out.  Every time I adjust them I inadvertently touch one of the controls.  Especially the forward or reverse feature that then kicks in and changes the place within the podcast I like to listen to.  Plus, I have the podcast app set to only advance or reverse in 15 second increments but the ear buds jump to the next hour of play.  VERY frustrating!  Since the buds are so small there's no place to touch them without touching the controls.  I guess the sound is okay but I was so busy dealing with the bad design that I'm not sure!",1,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
Earbuds often disconnect for no reason. Or stay connected after you return them to the case. I’ve also ran into the problem of accidentally skipping ahead when I meant to pause what I was listening to. Not worth it. Just spend the extra cash and get some good ones.,1,1,2020-2-21,1,1,0
"My only big complaint is that I hear in my ear ""link lost"" all throughout the day.  My Samsung Note 9, is usually in my pocket or on my desk a few feet away.  So how they lose link is beyond me.  Sound quality is great, noise canceling is great.  Just can't stand having to reconnect as often as these do.",3,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"I never leave reviews but since it took me so long to pick out this set and I based my decision off of the reviews, I thought I should say that I weighed out all of the options for ear buds on Amazon and settled on these and I couldn’t be happier with them. They feel comfortable and always pair up without a problem, set up was super easy and there’s an ear bud size for everyone. I haven’t had any problems with the battery at all and I really have no complaints. Kind of annoying that to charge the charging box it doesn’t take a standard iPhone charger but it comes with a very short cable to connect it. It’s very limiting so I can see it being an issue but as long as you charge it at night you shouldn’t have any problems running low during the day",5,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"Honestly a great set for such a good price! I really enjoy the one touch system and how these ear buds operate.  They charge fast and last me almost a whole day.  I have a boss that crazy nags about phones and such when work inst busy.  So its nice to slip one of these in and listen to podcasts, music, or videos.  They fit right in my ear and they dont come out when I work out with them.  Havent really gotten them wet though so no clue on that part.  I will say the case they come in is a little weak, but as long as you are careful with it, It shouldn't be a problem",5,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
I really like these earbuds. The sound is very good and loud enough to listen perfectly when there are other sounds around. They really stay in your ear and are very easy to use. For pairing I only had to take them out of the case and my smartphone immediately found them. Battery is very good and the fact that they charge while in the case makes it even better. Battery like of the case itself is really good. I bought the buds a week ago and I haven't had to charge them ever since. I'm really happy with them.,5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"Seamless bluetooth connections even when switching between phones. Great Audio and mic quality. Love the wireless charging case with it compact size. The earbud fit very well without any fatigue even on long meetings.Another bonus. When working all day, you can wear one earbud, then swap it out while it charges.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
They say that you get what you pay for. And they are correct. I had no problem paying more. But the reviews were so good that I couldn’t pass these up. They are not load enough. And there is very little bass if at all. I kept playing my favorite bass songs to see if I were mistaking. But they never got batter. I’d rather use my corded ear buds.,1,1,2020-3-13,1,1,0
"I run a lot.  And I sweat - a lot.  Like i just got back from the pool.  I've been thru many sets of wireless headphones that claim to be water and sweat proof but these are just the best.  Never a problem.  Relatively easy to pair.  The only issue is that they are finikey to go off and for me to have confidence that they are charging - I look for the red dot on the headphones in the case which sometimes takes a couple times to come on - it's only then do I know they are charging and ""disconnected"" from my phone.  If I dont get that signal - they fight to pair with my other non-running headphones.  Minor inconvenience but super great product.",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"I was really excited about these earbuds, but I am so disappointed. I got the white ones and they literally look like marshmallows sticking out of my ear. Not cool or stylish at all. What's the point of good sound if you just look weird in them. Definitely not happy with it. I am in the process of returning them. I would not buy them unless you are okay with them sticking out of your ear. :/",3,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0
"I needed to replace my AirPods which magically disappeared. These were recommended by a friend who does tons of research and came highly recommended. I was able to pair these easily and was ready to use them in a couple of minutes. I also purchased the extended 3 year warranty because with electronics, especially those that are heavily used, you sometimes just don’t know. I no longer need to carry my phone around on speaker phone and can go about my work hands free!",5,1,2020-7-18,1,1,0
"Really wanted to love these but a couple of things I dont care for or issue with. First, when connected to phone, cant get them to auto connect when phone rings. Have to manually connect on phone. Shows connected on phone but dont auto connect. Second, just a little bulky cant wear for more than an hour or so before my ear starts aching.  Great sound quality and volume though.",4,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
"These were my first purchased wireless headphones. I was skeptical about the idea of wireless headphones but this is a huge game changer. Tozo is easy to use, responsive and sound quality is incredible. The connectivity range is about 30 ft. They have around 5-8 hour battery life for me.

"I got these hoping they would stay in my ears better than other ear buds I have had, and they do. That being said, they still fall out often when I bend down or over. Once it fell out when I took something out of the oven, and ended up in the oven! For the most part though they stay in pretty well when jogging, bicycling, etc.  Sound quality is fine for podcasts and calls, and I love how easily they pair with phone and computer when I take them out of the case. Battery life is excellent. Great deal for the price.",4,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0

My husband purchased these for me for my birthday in may and I've loved them since they arrived. Unfortunately I lost them when I vacationed a couple weeks ago so I had to purchase another pair. I havent purchased headphones in years bc I didnt see any that I liked that I though was worth it until these. And I loved them so much I had to get replace them. Also my wara are too small for the airpods or airpod shaped headphones which was another reason I wanted to try these and they actually stay in my ears! And they come with different sized ear pieces so whatever ear shape you have they should be able to stay in comfortably.,5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,1

"Seriously the best in ear wireless earbuds I've found. They sound amazing. If I had one single complaint, it would be that they could be a bit louder compared to other earbuds, which is cool because they do enough noise canceling that everything sounds fantastic regardless. The bass on them is awesome as well. That's a big deal for me.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"I already own the T10 earbuds and have been very happy with them but always wished they had longer battery life.  The T6's are supposed to feature that so I'm optimistic.One feature that I don't like about the T6's is that hinged top of the smaller carrying case only opens so far and makes using medium to large size fingers difficult to graps the earbuds to pull them out.  It's not impossible, just takes more concentrated effort than I'd like.",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0
"First, I was not able to use the wireless charging on these things (maybe I got a defected pair). It uses micro USB which is kinda disappointing. The worst part of all is I cannot get these to fit in my ear. I've tried all of the buds but they stick out far and won't stay put when I'm walking between classes. They're not bad but these little things made them not a great experience for me.",2,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"The touch controls are much less user-friendly than the prior version with a button. If you are using these while sweating profusely or running in the rain, they will not perform as intended.

I got the pink pair and love the color. I've been using these since February of 2020 and they have not had much issue until recently. One of the ear buds now only intermittently charges ( don't know if it's the earbud or the case that's having issue) and the black cover that protects the inside of one rabid has fallen off... up until recently I felt they were pretty good for the price point. I contacted their customer service 2 days ago and got a response earlier today stating they would send me a new set of ear buds. I was relieved to find they didn't resist replacing my product! I will update this review once they have sent me my replacement set. Overall I would say they sound good and work well but I will see if my original set malfunction was a fluke or if my replacement set runs into the same issues.,5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0

I bought the T10 headphones and decided to give them to a friend and picked up the T6 version. These headphones are a tremendous value and deliver exceptional performance. There nice and small and have 3 sets of ear pieces to accommodate different size ears. The ability to charge them wirelessly also is a plus as everyone has so many cords nowadays.,5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"This is my frst time trying a true wireless earbud and I'm more than impressed with the product. The buds feel great in my ears and have a good hold which is always a concern when doing something active while they are in. Plus they give you multiple silicon isolation pieces pending your ear size. The sound quailty is great for what I was lookin for (I'm no acoustic engineer). The lower frequency and heavier bassed music sounds great. Highly recommend these for anyone who is looking for a good true wireless earbud, that has a good sound quality, and won't break the bank. Dont think I'll go back to a wired/wireless (not truely wireless) earbud.",5,1,2019-11-26,1,0,0
"These are awesome. They work independently from one another. They fit snuggly and are noise cancelling, so at work i can only use one at a time. Not complaining. The only time it's warned me about low battery, is when I've forgotten to charge them at night. I first bought the black ones for my son. He's very athletic and sweaty. No issues with water log. He absolutely raved about them. So, I bought a second pair, white, for me. Highly recommended.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0

Now, the left ear bud doesnt stay connected and they dont stay charged.",1,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
Easy to pair and easy to use either one individually. I mainly bought this to talk on the phone with one ear bud. Works great in this mode. They also sound amazing when listening to music. The bass response is amazing (listen to Home Free's version of Ring of Fire and you'll see what I mean). Haven't had them long enough to comment on battery life.,5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,1
I bought these for my kids for Christmas last year (about 6 months ago). My daughter couldn't wear them so I inherited her pair. My son and I both use these all the time. They have had good sound quality and have been easy to use. My son's pair just started having issues maintaining a charge past an hour or so after being fully charged. I contacted their customer service about 3 hours ago and have already been contacted back. They are sending out a replacement pair. Thats really good customer service. I'm giving 4 stars just because of the battery life on the 1 pair but everything else has been on point. Hopefully this is just a one off issue.,4,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"I bought these back in January, they had been working great for me until one of the headphones just stopped working. Not sure what to do I sent a message to their customer service department. They responded very quickly to my email over the weekend and had me try a few troubleshooting steps, nothing would get it working again. They quickly sent me out a new pair to replace the faulty headphone. I can't believe how quick they were to solve the problem. In addition to Tozo's excellent customer service the headphones are are actually pretty awesome. Sound is great and they stay in my ears which is the first pair of headphones that I haven't had issues with them falling out. The headphones feel and look like quality headphones. I think I just got a faulty set the first go around, only time will tell.",5,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
"I purchased these for my 10 y/o daughter as a gift but was worried about them fitting her ears. I am happy to report that they fit perfectly and she is thrilled with the color. When I tested them, I was surprised with the quality of sound and features, and would consider these as being as good as my Apple AirPods. Super satisfied with this purchase!",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
This set of wireless Bluetooth earbuds definitely perform better than most. They connect quickly and I didn’t experience audio cut-out on either side as I listened to musics like my others. Both sides play audio synchronized. No lag on one side. A phone call to my son had no complaints of muffled conversation. All around a good set of earbuds,5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"These earbuds work great.  They fit in my ears and are very easy to use.  Sound quality is also very good and, as a DJ, I appreciate the amount of bass these earbuds put out.  I used them with both an IPhone and an Ipad and had no pairing problems at all. They come with a charging case, usb cord and four different sizes ear cushions which are very easy to switch if needed. These earbuds are definitely worth more than the price paid.",5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
Finally!!!!  Wireless earbuds that fit my small ears!  I love these.  The sound quality is good and sometimes the noise cancellation feature is TOO good (like when someone approaches me from behind and scares me half to death).  I love that they are pink so I know my teenage sons will leave them alone!,5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"I use these ear buds casually, since the gyms are still closed in my area, I still haven't had the full experience. However, I still use it while biking and running and the noise cancellation is surprisingly great. The ear buds fit perfectly, and there are alternate sizes as well, but it feels similar to my Beats stereo headphones when it comes to noise cancellation, which is surprising. Battery life is satisfactory, I personally don't listen for more than 2-3 hours at a time on average, so the charging case is more than enough. The sound quality is decent, I don't sense much of a difference between the quality in the buds and the headphones I referenced earlier. Overall, well done with this product!",5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"I love my TOZO’s because the sound quality is amazing! Love the way they fit perfect in my ear with a simple twist. I chose the Rose Gold color and they are so HOT. I love them so much that i bought 4 more, for the jealous kids and hubby! I can bump jams for hours while I do yard work or chores without bothering anyone... well my singing and dancing around while listening sometimes embarrasses the fam but the sound is so FIRE I can’t control myself sometimes. The kids were so happy to get them that I was “The Best Mom”! My husband couldn’t hate either cause they are so ON POINT, not one complaint. The TOZO’s are a steal at $50. Don’t hesitate and no need to look any further for the BEST wireless ear buds cause you have found... these are FIRE 🔥",5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0

The noise cancellation is super impressive. They were a little hard to fit in my ear. I changed out the rubber pieces and that did help some. I got the pink but kind of wish I went with white/black because the pink blends into my flesh and looks a little scary sometimes. Still keeping them though!,4,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0

The sound quality is shockingly good, the charging case is easy to pocket for a walk or run, AND it has Bluetooth 5.0 and wireless charging! I mean come on!I’m also one of those people who tried the AirPods (and AirPod Pros) and they just looked like alien antennas sticking out of my head (not to mention the discomfort of fit). Well, the TOZOs have very comfortable ear tips with 4 different sizes of fit to choose from.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
These arrived very quick and I am impressed so far. I have gone through several ear buds from different manufacturers and I am very happy with these.

"This is a very nice sounding pair of earbuds. Been jogging in the rain and worked with them a few times, and no signs of water damage. The work perfectly when worn together. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because, when I need to wear only one of them at a time, my phone has to be in my shirt pocket, otherwise the signal gets interrupted easily (even from a short distance, such as my pants pockets).Other than that, great product for the price!",4,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"I ordered this product because I was looking for a cheaper version of AirPods. While doing my research, I stumbled upon the Tozo T10s and T6s. Overall, I would give the T6s a 4 star review, but I gave them a 5 star review here because of the Tozo company themselves. I received the product and liked the earphones, but the charging case would not charge, and therefore could not charge the earphones either. After emailing Tozo customer support, they were quick to send me an entirely new pair of earphones and charging case. I was very happy with how they handled the situation, and the new charging case works properly. The product is a great deal for its price, and the customer service is even better. Would highly suggest.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,1
"The sound quality of these earbuds is great for wireless earbuds and they stay put during gym workouts, bike rides, and running in cold weather. The earbuds come out after less than a mile if it is hot or humid, but this is the case with almost all earbuds.I had an issue with one of the earbuds that would not reach full volume after a few months of use. The customer service at Tozo responded to my warranty request within an hour and offered to ship me a newer model for free.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"Okay product. I haven't used much other wireless buds so not really comparing. Just giving it 3 stars since it none of the sizes seem to stay in my ear at all. sound quality and battery is fine, but if it can't stay in ear it's kinda useless...",2,1,2020-2-24,1,1,0
"I really really liked these earbuds to start out with. Great sound, easy to use, and for the first time ever, small enough ear pieces that didn't hurt my ears.

"These are great so far. The only problem I have is powering off but these are my very first pair of Bluetooth headphones so I need practice. I love the number of earbud options for the size of your ear. Pairing was SUPER SIMPLE. One question I do have is about the lights on the charger itself...there’s no documentation on what they mean or when it’s time for charging the case...again, my first pair so I’m sure I’ll learn as I go.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
So I love the bass sound first and foremost !! The clarity is good especially for this price point !! I like that they don’t feel like they’re going to slip out since my AirPods constantly slip out and I’m afraid I’m going to lose them . These are now for my new everyday and they have plenty of options single pairing plus all these extra cushions to find your match . I’ll update on battery life and se if they workout proof !! But over all great for the price !! If you want crystal clear you can get a more expensive set but I’m all about the bass!!,5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,1
Bought these for my boyfriend because he wanted wireless earbuds.These are AMAZING. They are definitely waterproof because the genius forgot they were in his work pants and the earbuds were put through the wash. Took them out and dried them off and they still worked like a dream.,5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"These buds are pretty good with a few minor quirks. When in use I sometimes get the warning ""maximum volume"" whether i'm adjusting the volume or just swiping the screen.  The warnings are verbal, which is tedious. Adjusting the volume through the buds is tedious. The buds need equalization when listening to audio books.But they mostly sound great and stay put.",4,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
Just received today and paired with my Iphone. Got linked up fast and works perfect.Compared this intensively on multiple songs with Apple Airpods Gen 2 and came to a conclusion that the Tozo have too much Treble. The bass and other aspects of sound are good but I don’t like too much treble so I will be giving these to my wife and keep Apple Airpods lol,3,1,2019-12-10,1,0,1
You can always tell when a product has been tested and improved over and over again because it is intuitive and easy to use.  This is one of those.  The sound quality is excellent as is the battery life.  The charging case is just the right size and weight.  Really love these wireless headphones!,5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
I'm writing this review in order to activate my warranty and haven't even really tried the earbuds out yet. A little shady that they make you do this but whatever--I've used other Tozo earbuds (T10) in the past and they're generally great value for the price. I imagine these will be just as good.,5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"These are so cute! Way cuter than the ones made from a company named after a fruit (wink wink). I got the pink and love the pearly pink case they come in. I got these to use as a backup for my fruit-company ones but I think I like them better. The sound quality is decent  for sure. Nice full sound. No it’s not as good as other ear pods I mentioned, but then again, they are less than half the cost of so I wouldn’t expect that. I would buy again. Very nice quality and presentation.",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"Product would cut out every once in a while. Contacted their support and they said they would replace it. That was about 2 months ago.

So, review stays up!",1,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0

Worth the money!",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"This new edition of the Tozo wireless buds are a feat of engineering. I've owned a number of wireless earbuds and tried nearly all of the big players on the market. Tozo nails it with the T6 buds with an impressive balance of elegant design, price-defying sound quality, and approachable price. This is value in a package.The new case is very comparable in size and shape to the Airpod case, comfortably fitting in pockets. Build feels high quality and the bias in the sound for bass makes these an awesome pair for tough workouts fueled by heart-thumbing, bass-heavy songs.",5,1,2019-11-14,1,0,1
"Battery life 4 to 5 hours before you need to place them back in the case for a pick me up. The case will charge the buds 5 times without needing to be charged itself. It a pretty sweet system. Base is perfect for me and all my audio books. Great fit. I can't stand the thought of wearing $300 ear buds with a ""chicken bone"" hanging down out of my ear!",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"I LOVE them so far! Phone call quality is incredible And clear, sound quality with music is wonderful too. They connect very quickly and I didn’t have to fuss with pairing them to eachother. Just pull them out of the case and pop them in!These headphones include 6 different buds that you can try out to fit your ears which is awesome because I feel like I have weird ear canals haha. I had a different pair that I really enjoyed but lost one of the buds at work. This pair was a lot cheaper, was packaged more professionally, had impressive reviews especially considering the price, and are much more interchangeable to suit my needs. The case for the buds is slim and compact too which is awesome.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"All I can say about these is, wow. Great bass, great sound quality, great noise cancellation for those who want that(you literally hear nothing but your music). I own a pair of beats on ear headphones and Bose over ear headphones, but I wanted something more subtle and not so bulky on the head. After buying these for only 60 bucks, I have found my new favorite earbuds. Amazon keeps teaching me, you dont have to spend more to win more. A must buy for anyone second guessing!",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"So nice I bought it twice, first set was stolen when my car was stolen, they left the car but kept the earbuds so they must have liked them too!  Works great, pairs fast, great sound quality, and when music is playing I can't hear my wife talking to me so I guess the sound cancellation works too! In fact I even bought it a 3rd time for the wife because she loved how mine worked. They even fit in the stop watch pocket in my jeans.",5,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"So far so good! I have had difficulty finding ear buds that stay in my ears during runs and cardio exercises, but I haven't had any trouble with these. They stay in and have haptic touch to pause when engaging in conversation etc. I am not an audiophile so I appreciate the bass that these little guys produce.",5,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
I cant find any faults with the earbuds yet. They came exactly as advertised. Took me awhile to find the in ear piece that fit me the best it came with 7 pairs total so I would imagine there is something for everyone. This set if earbuds in comparable to Air Pods and Galaxy buds in every way. These come with the Ability to skip songs and adjust volume with the touch feature which the Air Pods lack originally although can be tweaked to do so. In addition regular air pods only have one size while these come with 7 in ear adapter pieces. These are also 1/3 the price of both of those leading products. Bottom line is I recommend these to anyone who needs a reliable  and inexpensive pair of wireless earbuds.,5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"I've been looking for a new pair of bluetooth earphones that have noise cancelation and good sound quality at a great price...and these are it! They already came with some charge on them so I could test them out, and the variety of earbuds allowed me to find the best size for my ears. I didn't know my wife was talking to me when I was sitting right next to her listening to music, and she commented that she couldn't even hear the music that I was listening to. I was able to pair them to my phone super quick, and I've been enjoying using them to listen to podcasts, class lectures, or music when exercising. The rechargeable case is small as well, which allows me to easily put it in one of my pockets without taking up much space. This is a great product :-) Thanks Tozo!",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"I tried to submit the free extended one year but the page does not exist. I use the smallest ear adaptor and just sitting still these fall out of my ears. The sound has no bass. It is incompatible with my ipad. There is no control over what plays. If I try to push them deeper int my ear, they stop playing and Siri asks how he can help.  I use these regularly in the morning and they work ok for that.",2,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0

"I was looking for something that had at least six hours battery life, would last at least a year, would maintain a stable Bluetooth connection with my iPhone, and could be worn discretely. I haven't owned these for a year yet, but so far they seem to fit the bill perfectly. The battery on the earbud part of the device (without a recharge for the case) has lasted me at least six hours of active use (audio/calls). The construction is solid and the sound quality is great.",5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
This is my second pair. I’m an online teacher and use them everyday to teach my class. I have a set for home and a set for school.

I highly recommend these earbuds for everyday and working online.,5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"I also have the T10 earbuds and was then offered these shortly afterward.  I find myself using these more frequently.  Sound quality is a very subjective assessment, but i will say i prefer the sound of these over the T10s.  They seem to sound more ""natural"" and balanced.  The tone quality is balanced and not skewed either way towards bass or treble.  Most bluetooth earbuds i've tried are slightly weak on bass, and these are no exception.  They also seem to fit me better, but again, fit is also a personal experience.  Battery life is good, but i'm rarely able to use them for more than 1 or 2 hours at a time, so it easily lasts that long.  I like the case, but i do find it a little difficult to get them out as there doesn't seem to be enough surface area to grab them.  I find myself turning the case upside down and shaking them out.  All in all, a nice set of earbuds at this price point and would highly recommend",4,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0

Terrible product. Bought in December I’ve used them 3 times and now they don’t work. I purchased the extended warranty which is user friendly.

"These buds leave a lot to be desired. The sound quality is so-so and the base in barely audible. The touch sensors are very touchy which you would think is a good thing except these buds do not stay in your ears well regardless of the tip selected and I am not a runner. Every time you adjust the fitting the you pause, change a track, turn down the volume, you get my point. The volume is not great overall and the range is fair. The wireless charging for the case is nice. After 2 months the left bud is dead. Look elsewhere if you want good sound and easy interface at a good price. I have since replaced these with a pair of Soundpeats - much better, same price.",2,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
"Ear buds fit nicely right out of the package  The sound quality is great and the charging case is really convenient.  Love that the whole thing is wireless and can be taken anywhere.  Small enough to fit in your pocket.  The Tozo T6 is smaller than the Tozo T10.  Both are great but the smaller package is a little more convenient for putting in your pocket on the go.  The wireless charger is awesome.  If you charge it up, it is good for 4 charges of the ear buds before it needs to be recharged.  There is a wireless charger that you can purchase that makes it even easier to charge.  Love these ear buds!",5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"The sound quality is so great. I've avoided wireless earbuds for years because they all sounded like crap to me. These don't. I would like the bass to be a tad lower by default, but that's something that can be easily adjusted with the equalizer on my phone.I also have weird shaped ears, like the part where the earbuds sit, so most earbuds refuse to stay in my ears at all. Especially while running. I haven't had that issue with these, and the excess earbud pads (or whatever you want to call them) of different sizes certainly helps that.",5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0

"Having previously bought the T10 version of these headphones, I decided to give my old ones to my son and try out the T6 model.  The T10's were great, but, with slightly more bulk, they would sometimes fall out of my ear while running.  I was pleased with the smaller form factor of the T6 and, sure enough, they stay put much better.  Bluetooth pairing is simple, and the in-case charging feature is very convenient also.

I vacuum a large carpeted hall on a weekly basis with more than an hour of a droning vacuum motor so I really appreciate the increase in noise cancellation these  headphones provide over my previous ones. The sound of these phones is such that the music is in the room and not just between my ears. And the bass is substantial. The convenience of a fast, wireless charging system is also a plus. The only issue I have is it is a little difficult to extract the buds from the charging case. Maybe a small strip of grip tape will help. Obviously I’m very please with my purchase.",5,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
These are my first wireless ear bud type headphones and I like them. They paired quickly and easily to my Pixel 4. Great sound for calls and clear for the other party.

"Purchased these Tozo T6 wireless earbuds for $49.99 as a smaller alternative to my larger Plantronics Voyager 5200. As far as sound goes these T6's wins at over half of the price of the Voyager 5200's. The complaints I have of the T6's are that removing them from the charging case can be difficult if you do not have small fingers with a good grip. Additionally, the microphone on the Voyager 5200's is much more clear compared to the T6's. However, the complaints I have are minor compared to the amazing value these T6's give you. I would definitely buy another pair due to the cost-benefit ratio is low-risk & high-reward.",5,1,2020-6-18,1,0,1
I bought these 7 months ago and loved this loved them from day 1.  But now... not so much.  The left earbud will not charge... no matter if its directly on the charger or on a wireless charger.  Super bummed.  I bought the Tozo T10s as well... but they didn't fit nearly as well as the T6.  I hope others have better luck.  At a $50 price point... I would expect better.,2,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
So I have a problem with the wireless charging. Really isn’t a deal breaker(but it’s supposed to only reason why I said something). The other problem I have if u don’t connected fast enough you can’t just turn it on it makes you actually put it back in the charging case to get them to pair up again so that you can even use them which sometimes is a real big pain in the butt especially when you’re in the gym you don’t want to carry that little black box with you. Other than that they’re great they fit perfectly in the ear they don’t fall out I literally have to take them out because I can’t hear other people around me.

These earbuds have great noise canceling. Just make sure that you chose the right rubber tip size. There are a few different sizes in the bottom of the box along with the charging cable. The touch functions on the earbuds are really responsive. It takes a few minutes to get used to it. You'll defiantly end up playing your music or activating Siri by mistake. The great part of the touch function is that you can just tap it or slightly touch it. No jamming it into your ear trying to push a button. The charger case is usb-c and has some nice led indicators on the front to let you know how much of the charge there is. The NC function gives you a nice toon to let you know when it is active.

Very much love these earbuds. Mainly use for bluetooth phone and listening to podcast/audiobooks while working out. Sound and voice quality excellent. The touch pad takes some getting used to but once mastered it works well. After 2 months one of the earbuds was giving me an issue so I contacted TOZO customer service via the Amazon website and they promptly gave me support to try and fix the issue.  Very attentive and they asked for feedback after every step. Got the issue resolved and I am a happy customer. Bought a different TOZO set for my wife also and she loves them. I also bought the wireless TOZO charger pad and works well with T6 and my iPhone! Thanks TOZO!,5,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"The TOZO T6 earbuds are excellent for voice communication, participation in internet meetings and listening to music.  They are easy to set up, easy to use, easy to transport and comfortable to wear. The charging case works well and its strong magnets keep the buds in place for charging.

But To do has generously agreed to replace in exchange for this updated 5-star review. It's my pleasure to give them a rating they richly deserve!",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"These just arrived and I’m having fun using them and trying all the demands etc. great sounds, cancels all surrounding noise, snug fit.Only part I cannot get to function is the command for Siri. Directions say to tap 3 times and it starts pulling up Siri but then instantly crashes and shuts Siri down before you can talk to Siri. frustrating but you can bypass this by just using “hey Siri”",4,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
The sound is really spotty even with my phone in my hands and I have repeatedly had trouble getting both to connect at the same time. Sometimes 1 ear piece will randomly go out and then it interrupts my music by saying the one still on is the “primary” over and over while the other one reconnects. Not a fan. Wish I could return them.,1,1,2020-4-1,1,2,0
I purchased these to enable me to listen to music while I workout in the pool (waterproof) At first I wasnt impressed with the muffled feeling that I sensed.  But once I got in the water with my jazz playing.  I was sold.  The sound is everything I want and need.  I workout in the pool about 4-5days a week and these make me want to do 7 days a week.,5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
I absolutely love these earbuds!! I have tried about 3 different brands and styles of earbuds but these are the best I have found. They also come with an assortment of different size tips for your ears so you can find that perfect fit. To my surprise they even have great bass and best of all they come in many colors!,3,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"I bought my headphones two months ago and they can no longer hold a charge overnight. They sound pretty good for the price, but if the batteries do not hold a charge they are not worth much to me.",1,1,2020-2-7,1,1,0
"At first, I couldn't get them to stay in my ear. I kept trying to keep them vertical and they would fall out. But, after reading the instructions again, I realized you have to put it in vertical the push down till its horizontal and then it stays in perfect!!! I saw a lot of reviews saying they did not stay in and pictures but they had them the wrong way! Try it! Honestly, I went for a run and they did not bulge a bit! Great battery life, nice case and fast charging! Also, great noise cancellation. I use them at work and it's just my music and I.",5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"LOVE! I love that they are pink! It took me awhile to pair with my iPhone Pro Max 11 but I got them to work and when they did, they sound awesome! I have the Tozo disc charger and all I had to do was set the box on the disc and they started charging right away! I can’t wait to see how long they last until I need to charge them again.",5,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"This is my first pair of truly wireless headphones and I have not been disappointed at all. They have paired to all of my devices extremely easily, they are comfortable to wear and have not fallen out once. One of the best features of the headphones is the case; each earbud is magnetic and snaps right into the case which automatically turns them off. The case is compact enough to carry around so all I have to do is take them out again and they automatically connect and are ready to use. I really have no complaints and even bought a second pair to keep at my office. Would recommend to anybody who doesn't want to spend $200+ on AirPods as these are well worth the price!",5,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"At first, I was hesitant getting this style because I've had problems with this type of earbud fitting my ears.  I thought if this does not fit, I can return them.  I was surprised at how they fit, how good the sound is and how comfortable they are.  The batteries have been lasting at least 3 days before recharge and the portable charger/case is really great!!  My brother-in-law paid $200 for his but this sounds just as good if not better as his.  Thank you!",5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
I like these earbuds. I lost my t10 earbuds when I moved. I ordered these because of the touch features that the other ones didn't have. The case is much slimmer and feels better in my pocket. The earbuds are a little more complicated to take out with the new t6 earbuds. But it's something I can get used to. We will see if these last longer than the previous t10s.. Which I didn't have to charge for 4 days..,5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"Edit: I was sent a replacement and this is working great. The sound notes are not too high now.The quality of the audio seems to  be okay, theres way too much bass to my liking, and also the high notes sound much higher. So, it sounded tinny at times and with a high bass. If you know what I mean (high treble + high bass). I did not feel that it will help my ear in the long run. The touch controls are great, better than Boltune, which I have tried from Amazon. Noise cancellation will be great because they almost act as tight earplugs.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"Overall I very much like these earbuds. The sound quality is great. The clarity is noticeable and the highs and lows retain the same clarity. The mids in between have a similar clarity as well. The fit is comfortable but can take a bit to get used to and learn to trust. I have not had them fall out without me doing something like accidentally hitting my ear. Of course, that should at least loosen if not make them fall out. The case is low profile enough to put in my pockets without any real discomfort. The case's lid is also very easy to open and close with a sure seal on it. The only complaints I have with these earbuds are the fit being more separated from the ear (that's mostly a ""me"" issue) and the earbuds are a little difficult to get out of the case. I personally very much like these earbuds and the two issues I listed are for the most part non-issues. Highly recommended",4,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"This is my 1st review in atleast 5 years of prime membership. I've tried 5 different sets of earbuds from Amazon and these blow them all out of the water. Great phone call quality, everyone i talk to hears me perfectly. Great battery, both for the earbuds and charging case.  I love the wireless charging, i can just use my note 10 wireless power share. The case is nearly identical size to airpods, for me this a must, as they are not bulky in slim jeans. No connection issues at all. Both buds can act as master, so either one can be placed back in the case without stopping music or calls, and either one can be used for calls solo. They have every possible control feature as well (Volume control,  voice assistant, next song, previous song, etc...). The touch sensitivity is great as well. You just pop them in your ears and they are paired instantly, 1 touch of either bud starts my music right where i left off! Can't say enough good things about them!",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
"I wasnt sure what to expect from these as I had never heard of the brand but they had great reviews so I thought I'd give them a try..well im glad I did.  I purchased 2 pair, one for me and one for my 13 yr old.  He kept begging me for airpods...i wasn't paying airport prices for him to lose them...so these felt like a good alternative. .and they were..  The sound quality is amazing, they fit well in my ears.  The battery life surprised me, they charge up fast and the battery last a long time.  Everything i could have wanted in a great pair of earbuds.",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
I’ve been using my earbuds for over a month now and I am extremely satisfied with this product. They are excellent and the price is even more so! I once spent 6+ hours straight talking on the phone with various friends and family and they still had battery left. I was VERY impressed and FASCINATED! Don’t think twice and buy them! You will be very happy!,5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"They fit comfortably in the ear and come with many different ear tip sizes! They paired very easily and are easy to use. The case is very similar to AirPods, but I couldn’t tell the difference between left or right just by feeling. However, they are marked L and R near the charging contacts. The sound quality is good overall. Did very well in noise cancelling. The sensor controls are functional and work as intended. It’s easy to use - the instruction manual was a little more complicated than it should have been but was easy to master overall. Haven’t tested out the waterproof capabilities yet but it says you can swim with them in; just not submerged underwater.",5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
"I absolutely looove these earbuds! The price is great! The sound quality is great! I haven’t had any issues with them dying because the charging case fits comfortably in my pocket. When I’m not using them, I put them back in the case. Another awesome thing is they stay in my ears. I had to try on a couple of the different attachments that came with it. Once I found the right fit, I ran two miles with no issues! I would definitely recommend these wireless earbuds! Go, Tozo! What an awesome product!",5,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
"These are way better than I thought they were going to be. They are one of the best pairs of headphones I have ever had. I know the T10s are supposed to be louder, but these are loud enough for me. Sound quality is fantastic in all ranges. I think they would be even better if the bass was just a tiny bit punchier, but it’s still quality regardless. It came with 5 ear piece sizes to choose from which is great. The touch buttons are pretty cool, but they are going to take some getting used to for me. I absolutely love that the case charges them. I wish they would have some neater color options, but I I am okay with black. It’s a pretty good product if that’s the biggest complaint. They are definitely worth it for the price. I’m very happy with them.",4,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"These always disconnect automatically from my phone, does not cancel any noise unless you jam them in your ear which of course hurts (I’ve even changed the earbud cover to a small size). I didn’t like the idea of the Apple pods hanging out of my ear, reminded me a scene in a movie “There’s something about Mary”. I’m gonna throw these out and buy something else. Money wasted.",1,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"These earbuds are worth the price. I also really appreciate the fact that they are waterproof for up to a meter for 30 minutes. You wouldn’t think that be more than just a gimmick. But I find it very useful. For instance, when I’m showering, I don’t have to worry About my earbuds. These do occasionally disconnect and reconnect. I don’t really understand that’s on an interval but I’ve had the same issue with the tozo 6. The tozo 6 was much worse about it happening every few hours. This one only happens one every few days. But, maybe that is because they are new. Either way, I think they are very worth it and a great first entry into the wireless ear Bud World.",5,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0
"So far, these are the best earphones I've had. Great sound, clear and crisp, with the bass. Easy to charge and the battery last a long time.  Bluetooth is a glitchy and sometimes when I need to push in the earbuds, I pressing options.  But at least it has options on the earbuds, an update from the last model.  So far, so good. Time will tell, Ive had a few different earbuds brands. Best one so far.",5,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
I have always been reluctant to purchase wireless earbuds as the ones that came with my phone fit poorly and would always drop out even while walking so being a distance runner I was afraid that one would fall out and be lost.

"Just got these. The first impression is really great. The pairing worked well both with my android phone and mac laptop. Sound quality is great. Not sure about battery life yet, will update if abnormal. Charging works fine. The default pads fit well for me although it does come with a few different sizes of pads which is great. So far so good! Liked the touch button feature.",5,1,2020-5-23,1,1,0
"I have been lamenting over $200 ear buds for sometime -- mostly for my frequent airplane trips -- but I did not want to drop the $200 . I decided to try an off brand and after reading some great reviews on Amazon for these earbuds -- at 25% of the cost, I clicked the order button. Trying them out at home I could not believe how good the noise cancellation was -- actually amazing for earbuds. Very pleased with my purchase!",5,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
"These are good earbuds! The sound quality is so so, but they are so compact, lightweight & convenient that it really makes up for it. Love the compact charging case... It's basically the same size as the air pods case! They stay well in your ear and cancel outside noise extremely well... Almost too much for my taste. I've had zero issues so far!",4,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
Sound quality isn’t the best or comparable to my beats but the comfort makes up for it. If they’re truly waterproof then they are worth every dollar. I frequently struggle to find ear buds due to my small ear canal size. These were a pleasant surprise that fit nicely while I jog.,5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"Sound,battery life,and call quality are excellent.  All the touch controls are good.  I think the only control missing is the volume down, but I control volume with smart watch.  Either earbud can be worn in either ear ( to me they appear identical, I like driving with a bud in my right ear , something that can’t be done with AirPods) and they are very light, I forget I’m wearing them.  The wireless charging feature is great as I use a 3 in 1 wireless charger for my devices.  Also the case is similar to the AirPods case only slightly bigger but very comfortable to slide in pocket.  Only petty complaint is there is no GPS tracking feature but for this price it’s a Go!!",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I loved these earplugs from the moment I first tried them out. You can imagine how disappointed I was when I lost one plug in the snow over two weeks ago. Well, you can imagine once again when the lost plug turned up in my driveway this evening. It must have been lost in the snow all that time. It was dirty so I rinsed it off. It was dead, so I charged it up. Once again you can imagine my surprise when the damn thing worked. I would recommend these plugs to anyone in need of an excellent pair of reasonably priced earplugs.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
I absolutely love these earbuds. It's insane how easily they block out outside noise. They're super easy to use and my phone paired with them in seconds. The sound quality is amazing. I need to find more songs to play now that I have these earbuds. The case is super convenient for extra battery life and the magnetic closure is simply satisfying to hear and see. They're basically my new toy for Christmas and I love them.,5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"These ear buds are difficult to charge. I have to really push the second one down and wait for a few seconds for it to show the light. I think once I put it down, it may disconnect. Many mornings as I go for a walk after charging these, one is not charged.Also they cut out alot when I make the slightest turn of my head, not a biggie but a bit annoying.",3,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
These bubs are great for workouts.  Totally waterproof (IPX8) and sit firmly in the ear.  Noise cancellation is by passively blocking out the environment via the fit.  Bass biased sound.  Will not find true wireless buds that give a better value.  I also own a pair of Galaxy Buds Plus which provide superior sound at 4 times the price. They are also only IPX2.,5,1,2020-10-5,1,0,0
"They're good in the way of staying in your ear i guess....but the sound is awful. It's just static and constant breaking up. They sound like theyre stuck under water and really muffled and far away sounding.They hardly ever stay connected to blue tooth. They randomly disconnect and reconnect for no reason, and they die very quickly. Not worth the money.",1,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"The earbuds themselves seem to be very well built. The charging case is nice and it charges without being plugged in. You also get a large variety of adapters for your ears. I had some trouble getting the ear pieces to fit, but once I figured it out, they are great.  I also had to make some adjustments to my phone, and now the bass is amazing.  I really like the touch feature that allows me to pause music or skip to the next song.  Very good value in ear buds.",4,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
Hands down! Great ear buds for the price. The sound on this are great. The volume to me personally are very loud I keep them generally at mid level. The noise canceling is 50% compare to high end products but it does help. The base is amazing. To connect to your phone was super easy. I used it with a Samsung S10 Plus. The range is very modest. I live in a 2 floor house and I get full range all around. It starts to tweak once I'm in front of the house and that's with my phone on the  second floor all the way in the back room. I would definitely be buying another one as a gift 🎁.,5,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"These things are amazing. The sound quality is the best I've ever heard - they put the wired Beats I'm replacing to shame. It's crystal clear with crisp highs and vocals and ear-shaking bass that does not drown out the vocals and highs like my Beats did. Easy pairing, simple to use, and cool features at a great price. Don't waste your money or time looking any further.Only downside and the reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the touch features. As soon as you remove them from the case they pair and you start giving it commands without realizing it while trying to push them into your ears. Same when removing them from your ears - you'll cue up music, rewind songs, and other stuff while you're trying to put them away.",4,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
I just purchased these one because I needed them and I did not want to pay a ridiculous amount on AirPods. I’ve only had them two days but I can tell you they were very easy to pair. I use with my phone and lap top with no issue. I have it a 4 star only because there were no instructions on how to charge. Yes it comes with a cable but where do you put it. I didn’t want to damage the case so I used a wireless charger that I use for my phone. The only downside right now is that I have only one wireless charge for both my phone and headphones so I’ll have to purchase a larger charger or another one. But overall I’m pleased so far with them.,4,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
These are great ear buds. I don’t like taking my AirPods Pro out of the house so I got these. They are comfortable and the sound quality is pretty awesome. Easy to use. I purchased the white ones and I like how its more of a pearl white color. The touch controls can be sensitive but it’s a matter of getting used to them.,5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"I received my new TOZO T6 earbuds just yesterday and so far I am very happy with my purchase!  I purchased a pair of Apple Airpods for my son for Christmas but just didn't want to spend the $$$ on another pair for myself.  So for a third of the price I couldn't be happier with my purchase!  Very easy to sync, love the look and feel of the pods and the case!  They also have GREAT sound quality and they include a FREE 1 year extended warranty!  What's NOT to love!!",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0

Well worth it all around.",5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
"The earbuds seem a little bulky but you get used to it. I like that the charging case can also charge on my wireless charging pad and that it comes with 5 different earbud cap sizes so you can fit it to your ear. Sound quality seems ok, a little tinny but have only used for a few minutes. Better than fighting with the wired earbuds. Would recommend for the price.",4,1,2020-7-16,1,1,0
"Value received, lately I’ve ordered several products that I was a wee bit skeptical of when I hit the buy button.  I debated these earbuds reviewing the specs and previous owners comments.  So far so good, for the price the purchase was outstanding, I’m sure someone with a far superior audio background could argue the point, for myself these plugs work great.  While it’s intuitive, take a moment to read the instructions, their clear and helpful.  I always liked the thought of design that went the combination carrying case & charger, nice touch.",5,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
I just got these so some questions I can’t give 5 stars on yet because I haven’t had them long enough but I do think these are great quality so far. They look expensive. Packaging is very nice. They come with a variety of ear piece sizes and a very nice charging case you can either use a wireless charger or plug in to bottom. I am still learning to use the controls but over all these are sleek and easy to use.,4,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0
I’ve only used these once so far in a moderately noisy gym - a couple running machines in use and some background music- and quite frankly I had to strain to hear the music from these ear buds.

Disappointing that they didn’t last very long.",4,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0

Highly recommend!",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"This is a great product for the price. They are easy to pair and sound is great, the noise cancelation does not seem to work very well.

They are cheaper than apple and samsungs versions and still work as well.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"I have tried few earbuds in this price range and this is by far the BEST! I had heard about Tozo a lot so thought of giving it a shot, and am glad I did!

Would highly recommend it!",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
My second day of having these.  Overall I’m happy with them.  With the multiple sizes of silicone ear pieces I was able to find a very comfortable fit.  The sound quality is great.  The touch controls can be a little finicky.  You have to be very careful not to touch the outside of the ear piece or it will pause or skip the song.  They are a little bit bigger than I expected them to be but not obnoxiously large.  Not sure about battery life yet,4,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"I bought these headphones a couple months ago, and I've been very happy with them since. The sound quality is way better than I had expected they'd be. So much of what I read online before purchasing was telling me I'd have to spend $150+ to get decent sound and battery life. All of that was nonsense, as the T6 are perfect for me. The battery life is also outstanding. I would have to charge my previous pair of headphones 2 times a day to get the use I wanted out of them. These get through an entire workday.These headphones have pretty much been glued to my side since I got them.",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0

"They provideD many options of the silicon fittings so if you’re worried about getting a perfect fit, these are for you. The excellent fit just adds to the noise canceling abilities. Only issues I had were one earbud mysteriously began to die too early, (which must’ve been a fluke cause I could not find anything about it online) and when I contacted the company, theY immediately replaced the pair. Excellent customer service and very quick to answer. Winnie was a huge help.",4,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
I've had these earbuds for 2 weeks. I use them as headphones for my home office computer. I spend hours listening to music from You Tube. The sound quality is as good as I could expect from war buds. The bass is better than I would have expected from earbuds. Battery has been lasting about 5-6 hours. But because when I take them off the only logical place to store them is in the self charging charger the self contained battery has only run down to where they needed to be recharged once. And that was because I purposely left them out of the charger to see how long they would last before they needed a charge.,5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
The sound is pretty great and the sound cancellation does work very well! I have not tested out whether or not they are water proof so I don't know. The battery life is pretty great. I will say the sound gets a little wonky with my bluetooth sometimes but usually only when the phone and the headphones are a bit far away from each other. Definitely worth the money.,4,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"Welp... I’ve had these for almost 3 months now. Theeeerrree Greeeat 🐯! No really though... they last over 4 hours of music time... full volume from my iPhone. YES, they are waterproof! I shower with them thangs! I won’t lie but heavy makes the song change as if I touched it with my fingers, honestly I’m not gonna complain for what I got for $50. I love them. The case charges w/ wires and wirelessly. Don’t doubt these buds. They are worth it.",5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,1
I dont have a service provider at the moment and have to manually answer calls on my phone now. Tapping the ear bud wont answer calls through apps such as FB or Textnow. Lame..

The battery life is what get me .... it doesn’t last I give it about a good 4-5 hours ... I’m use to having beats that battery life last up to 12 hours... they are a good buy if you’re not looking to spend 200$ .the sound can be a little muffled sometimes when you get a song with loud base ...,5,1,2020-4-23,1,1,0
"Worked fine for about 5 uses. Volume slowly stopped working until only a very faint sound at max volume. Return window closed after 30 days and they stopped working shortly after that. Cannot get a refund and steps I was instructed to use to fix the problem did not work.I never write reviews, but I would definitely NOT recommend. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.",1,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"So far, so good.  These things are small and the small, airpod style case makes them easy to carry around.  The case size/shape is what made me choose these over the slightly less expensive Soundpeats.  I like that you can use them individually in a mono mode or together for stereo.  No problems pairing either side or both at the same time.  I did have them completely cut off during a song for no apparent reason.  I simply stuck them back in the case to reset, pulled them back out and they have been working fine ever since.  I appreciate the 1 year warranty that comes in the package  that you can sign up for.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have not had these for very long and do not yet know of longevity.",4,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"I tried these out in my first half marathon, they were comfortable (in fact, kept checking they hadn't fallen out) and battery lasted whole time.  Only thing I'm not completely happy with, and is probably human user error, is that they are hard to use the tapping - they would forward songs when I rearranged in my ear, apparently I tapped them accidentally, and i'd tap on purpose and nothing would happen, then tap again, and it would pause, just couldn't get a hang of it, will have to try again - I ended up just using controls on ipod.",4,1,2020-1-22,1,1,0
"These are great for the price! Very little outside noise. The touch commands aren't super easy to keep straight because each earbud does different things depending upon the number of times touched, etc. There are cheat sheets included though. The battery life has been much better than I expected. I would totally buy them again!",5,1,2020-2-29,1,0,0
"The devices are contently falling out even after trying the various size ear pieces.  Fortunately, I only use these to take calls and listen to music at my desk.  I could never exercise with them.  I have used many other earbuds and have never had this problem.  In addition, the sound is fair at best, no base even after enabling base booster on Spotify.4/10/20 update:  I was contacted by a TOZO representative who offered to send a replacement or provide gift card.  I opted for the gift card.  This level of customer service is greatly appreciated.  As a result, I would be willing to purchase another TOZO product in the future.  Updated from two stars to three stars.",3,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0
"I am technologically challenged, and these were EASY to set up and provide amazing sound! I like the color (pink), but would love it if they were truly rose gold. They hold a charge beautifully and while it looks like they are in a bigger case than T10, the case is smaller and more pocket friendly. My husband has the T 10’s which are still great, but this case is better and holds a longer charge. The T10’s are good too though!",5,1,2020-3-24,1,0,1
"I lost my Bose wireless earbuds and decided to look for a cheaper alternative. I hit the jackpot with the TOZO T6.  Sound quality is amazing. Very clear and great bass.  They easily paired with my Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Very easy to operate, all touch commands work with the slightest touch, even with my Head Sensatech gloves!  Fit nice and comfortable in my ears, barely noticeable even after 2 hours. Not advertised as noise cancelling, but they do. They were perfect on my flight. Great battery life (battery level shown on phone Bluetooth settings). Works on wireless charger. Charges case in less than an hour. Earbuds recharge quickly as well.",5,1,2019-11-20,1,0,1
"These wireless earbuds are my first pair and I am really impressed by the sound quality. The case that these come in is compact so it fits in my pocket and I love the feature that the earbuds snap right into place when you put them in the case. Overall, great quality and great price!",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"I'm giving these five stars because for the price they're absolutely perfect. The touch controls take some getting used to but they're easy to use. They connect almost instantly once I take them out of the case. They fit very well and don't fall out, and they block out everything else 👍Sounds is actually really impressive, they sound more in the $150-$200 range, not going to blow you away but still very nice.",5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"Very nice pods,  they're the first ones I've owned so don't have anything to compare them to.  They sinc right up and you can charge one while wearing the other.  They look very nice,  charging case looks very nice and professional as well.  Wish they went louder,  but they would probably be hurting my hearing if they did",5,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
The packaging was so sleek. I ordered a black and white set. At first I thought they gave us 2 black sets. So maybe fix the packaging. My partner wanted earbuds as fathers day gifts but I spent so much on other items. These were affordable and he loves them. He says they're better than his earpods.,5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
"Sound like most headphones.  Cool pink color.  Disappointed in the noise cancellation.  Water proof is shady.  Instructions claim they are shower safe.  Won't try again.  Don't like how they keep skipping as I'm washing my hair.  The touch features are cool.  They are light.  Just maybe worth $25, not $35-$45",3,1,2020-8-18,1,0,1
Worked fantastic straight out of the package.  I prevously had a differnet pair of bluetooth headphones and the button made it difficult to use them properly... these ones are perfect though with their touch screen style buttons on the head phones.Audio / Mic quality is really great too.  I tested out some phone calls and the person I was talking to could even hear me well while I whispered!,5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"I was skeptical to buy these as they are the 3rd pair of -$50 wireless earbuds (hated the other two models which shall remain nameless). But saw the reviews on these and gave me a whirl.  Great sound, great noise cancelation, solid quality and battery life. They feel expensive.  I use them every day on my runs.  My only quirk is when they get sweaty, they tend to slip out of your out at times.  But other than that, good buy!",4,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"I really liked these earbuds.. all technical aspects (sound, battery life, fit, noise cancellation) are great .. my major issue is the extremely sensitive touchpad.. it seems to react to the slightest graze which makes me hesitant to touch them or even adjust them in my ear.. I had to stop using them",3,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"I usually do not write reviews unless I'm either blown away or very disappointed by an item.  I am writing a review on these headphones because I am very upset and disappointed.I loved these when I first bought them!  The sound and base were amazing and I thought they were better than my son's Airpods; however, one of the headphone buds completely stopped working after 2 months (or approximately 30 hours of use)!!!  I verified there was nothing blocking the bud's speaker like wax, etc.  and that they were adequately charged.  Nothing solved my issue.",1,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
"Love the sound quality and convenience of these earbuds! Easy to use and my phone calls worked great, very clear from both sides of the call. The max volume of these aren't for someone who wants theirEar drums blown out when on high. The max volume is great for the quality of the sound but won't impress someone used to ""rocking out"" lol.",5,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
These earbuds come in attractive case. Charging port on bottom takes a little jiggling to get open. Have not tried the wireless charger option.Booming sound with great bass support. Ability to modify fit to ear with provided additional earbuds.,5,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"I did a lot of research on different types of wireless earbuds before finally choosing the TOZO T6. I was a little skeptical that everything listed would be accurate but took a leap anyway. WOW!! These are the real deal and I highly recommend them. The music is clean, the bass is great, noise cancellation is amazing, and the touch controls arent too hard to figure out or remember. What are you waiting for?!",5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"I was just evacuated last week due to a wildfire!  I missed the return window!  These provide multiple ear-thingys for sizing, my ears are so small I cannot keep the earbuds from falling out of my ears!  I would have to duct tape them to my head.  They are useless to me 😔",1,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
I absolutely loved these when I gotst purchased! It has been 3 months since purchase and when I'm on a phone call no understands me. I have to disconnect them and hold my phone which defeats the purpose of these headphones. I thought it was a glitch but no. For 3 weeks they can not hear me. Turned out to be a expensive set of headphones for music. 😭😭,1,1,2020-9-28,1,0,1
"I have loved my experience with these earbuds. The sound is amazing and I can't hear any outside noise when I'm listening to music. They immediately paired with my iPhone without any problem and the voice quality while making phone calls is crisp and clear. I also have ears that don't usually work well with earbuds but these have stayed in super well, even when I was trying hard to knock them out. I'm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend them.",5,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"These headphones are excellent! Pairing them was extremely easy, and the sound quality is great! Excellent at blocking any outside noise. I've enjoyed using them so far. The battery will last several hours with constant use, such as listening to music, or long phone conversations. The headphones come with a selection of 5 different earbuds as well as the pair already installed, so you can find the set that fits most comfortably. They are indeed waterproof, though the manufacturer doesn't recommend using them while swimming, as the Bluetooth signal diminishes quickly underwater. I would definitely recommend these over similar, more expensive alternatives.",5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
These are awesome. I wanted something that had a battery case so I wouldn’t be stranded with a pair of dead earbuds. They work from the start. No fuss. It just works. Not much of a learning curve either. The only thing that could make this thing perfect is if it had USB-C instead of USB Micro.,5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"As you can see, this is the best set of ear buds I have ever had.  I am a minister and at the last minute I was called to preside at a funeral.  I forgot that the earbuds was in in my ear.  During the funeral I received no calls. But after the funeral, I received a call and it rang in one ear.  This is when I knew that one ear bud was gone.  Is it possible to get or buy just one ear bud to go with one I got?  Minister in crises.  I am also a 20 year retired Marine (1970-1990).  Thanks for listening 👂",5,1,2020-8-22,1,0,0
"Excellent earbuds.  I really like the form tattoo of the case.  It’s slim so it doesn’t bulk your pocket when carrying. I also like the touch controls on the earbuds, rather than a push-button like others have.  And the charging lights on the case are a nice added feature.  But really, excellent sound for the price and water resistance are my biggest pluses.",5,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"Excellent sound quality, especially on lower frequencies. Noise-cancellation very effective, function like earplugs when sound is off. Comfortable fit. Battery life seems excellent thus far. Microphone audio may be a bit unclear on phone calls (some ask “Where are you? Are you in your car or something?” Others report no issues). Bluetooth range similar to other devices. Have not tested water-proofing. Overall the product works perfectly for my intended use.",5,1,2020-5-12,1,1,0
"These are amazing! First, they’re so easy to use. Paired easily with my phone and my TV! I love how easy they are to reset if I do something wrong (which rarely happens). They auto pair to each other as soon as they are removed from the case. The case is also easily rechargeable, either on a wireless pad or with a micro usb. I’m so glad I purchased them— such a great value and a reasonable price!!",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
Excellent sound quality and super easy to use and set up.  I set them up in less than a minute and learned to use the touch sensors just as quickly.  This is the second pair I buy cause my dog chewed up the previous ones which were one model older so I decided to upgrade and I am very pleased with the purchase.,5,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"I've used the previous version of these earphones, the t10 and absolutely loved them. The t6 is even a step up from that. They are extremely comfortable to wear, most earphones hurt when in my ears for a prolonged period but these are comfortable to wear all day for me. The touch control is a nice quality of life change, on a walk today I simply moved my finger over the top of it to turn on and off my music on Spotify. They connect to my phone effortlessly on bluetooth. The sound quality is amazing, its very crisp and the volume range is good. The battery life is amazing, it lasts for about 4 hours without having to use the case, its good for long commutes or a day out and all around an amazing product! The only complaint I have is working on the responsiveness of the touch controls in the future as they are delayed by a second or two, but its an EXTREMELY minor nitpick from me.",5,1,2019-10-25,1,0,1
"Exactly what I was looking for! I highly recommend this product! After yet another pair of expensive headphones failing me (most recently my Beats) I was on a mission to find headphones that weren’t nearly as expensive( as we are only paying for the “name” after all). I read many reviews on these and decided to give them a try since they were spoken about so highly. I am so happy with my purchase. The sound is awesome, operation is user friendly! And they fit my tiny tiny ears comfortably. I am so satisfied I am going to buy a second pair for my kid & I won’t feel guilty about not purchasing a top dollar pair bc these work just a well if not better!",5,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
Liked: good enough sound quality.Sticks in ear while working out better than expected but not as good as those with loops around ear of course.,3,1,2020-7-17,1,1,0
"Overall, not too bad of wireless earbuds. As a huge AirPod and AirPod pro fan, I picked these up as a cheap pair of headphones I could use at work and let them get dirty. I like the fact I can wear either bud one at a time, and the fact they have voice assistants is a plus. The sound quality is just “Meh” in my opinion. The sound is a bit “tin” ny sounding to my ears. The bass seems to be lacking a bit but I’ll be using these mostly for podcasts personally.",3,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"I took them right out of the box and was able to easily pair them to my Galaxy S9 Plus, put them in, and use them for my podcasts. Touch controls work on them as advertised. They don't get quite as loud as I would like, but that is a preference. They charge right up in the case when using their charging pad I also purchased.",5,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
Bought these to replace some Walmart ear buds that were around the same cost. I was blown away by the comfort and response in these headphones. They come with plenty of rubber tips neatly packaged. Battery seems to be plentiful and have not had any issues with sweat or water bothering these. Definitely cancel out noise as I run grinders and power tools all day and can't even hear the scream of an air file over these. Seriously impressed.,5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"So I've literally bought this same set of headphones three times now, because my stupid self keeps losing them but they're SO GOOD FOR THE VALUE!Seriously, get them. Wouldn't have bought them three times over if they weren't worth the money. Now if I can just stop losing them....",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"I have tried the product on for the whole day. The overall experience was great except for one thing: mic quality. I did a phone call test this morning. The sound quality at my end was amazing, but not at the receiver’s end. When I was outdoor, she couldn’t hear anything I said.The rating I would give for this product:",4,1,2019-9-23,1,1,0
"I was pleasantly surprised with these. The sound quality and noise cancellation are great! What really impressed me is the battery life. Connectivity is good with these, not too much of an issue losing connection. I use the smallest ear buds for these, but they don’t fit securely without twisting them in. I’d buy these again.",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
I just recieved these ear buds and they are an upgrade from the T10. For starters the case fits better in my pocket than the previous version which  I hated carrying.  Sound quality is noticeably better.  The old version would sometime fade out when I turned my head.  I could never figure out why it only happens sometimes but they are still great ear buds. My old pair will be a great back up.  I recommended these to family members and now they all have their own pair. Great bang for your buck.,5,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
"I just received these wireless ear buds today, they were very simple to pair with my phone and the music quality is very good. While on a phone call with these ear buds I proceeded to make lots of noise and the caller said that as soon as I started talking all the outside noises (running water, noisy fan) went away and they could hear me very well. I ran, jumped and shook my head with these ear buds in and they did not even slip, I’m very confident that they will stay put. I have to say that I’m very impressed for the price point! I have not had a chance to test out the battery life on these since I just these but I’m hoping that will do great as well!",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"I love these ear buds.  I wanted a pair that I could take to work, use around the house, and use on my motorcycle and these are great. The battery seems to last forever and I like the fact that the case also charges to provide more battery life. They stay in my ears through running, jumping, and dancing and don't make my ears sore like some ear buds do. They completely cancel out noise from my experience as well.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"Everything works great. Use them every day. At work and while exercising. Great battery life, great sound quality. Rarely fall out.2 small complaints: I accidentally touch the sensitive buttons when adjusting headphones. Also, while these are waterproof they do not work in the shower as the water sets off the touch-activated controls.",5,1,2019-11-25,1,0,1
Overall these are pretty decent cheap ear buds. They took some fiddling to find the right top for my ears but they include 6 different sizes. The battery case feels top notch while the earbuds themselves feel a little cheap. For the cheaper price point I am not complaining.I got them for listening to audiobooks and they do not disappoint for spoken audio. For music there are def better ear buds but for the price point I'm not complaining.,5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"I own a pair of T10 that sound great but don't stay in place.  Kept losing one of them when they fell out at the worst times.  The T6 sound just as good but are smaller and lighter and seem to stay in place much better.  I can use the T10 if I'm inside, but use my T6 when I'm outside and active.  Highly recommend.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
These are the best I've tried so far. I have tiny ears so getting earbuds to fit and stay in is not easy. But these went in so easy and never came out. Great quality and sound. I love all the different ear caps there are different ones for different situations. So happy.,5,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"Amazing headphones! Fit very well inside my ears, while I’m at the gym I don’t move or wiggle about. Only thing I wish they would have would be that they would get a little bit louder. When I arrived in the mail, it was a free offer for either an extra battery box or a free wireless charger, put down for the wireless charger and haven’t received it yet. All in all, highly recommended, definitely worth the purchase.",4,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"I’ve been using this for a month now and I love it. I always put it back into casing when I’m not using them so that they’re charging. Used it while walking the dogs and it’s very clear while talking on the phone, music also sounds good. It’s perfect for me when it’s only a fraction of the price of apple airpods.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
Can I just say that these earbuds seem cool and everything. But they seem HUGE. like 2 wine corks sticking out of my ears. I’m trying to find small low profile earbuds. And I want to give these a chance... but I’m already kinda buggered at the size of them.I’ll update my review once I actually try them out.,4,1,2020-2-29,1,0,0
"I really love my ear buds, yes, not only affordable, but great quality sound, and they actually fit my ears! iphone earbuds fall out of my ears or I'm constantly adjusting them, not the Tozo's T6!  They come with a variety of ear sizes to custom fit your ear, awesome!  I also had a freak accident and a earbud fell out of my ear on a walk and a car rolled over it-not normal. I emailed Tozo and they responded within a day to notify me they would replace them with the warranty. I was really happy about that, very prompt customer service. Highly recommend!",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"This item sounds like my AirPods.  good sound and music. Mic to speak on the phone sounds good as well.I think overall a very good competitor to my AirPods 2 for much less money. I was looking for something with a little more bass, but not unhappy just know they are not made for bass heads and will work well at the gym for me.",4,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"These were a big disappointment.  They did NOT pair easily, even after I did a factory reset.  More frustrating was trying to get the earbud covers on the ear pieces.  They just wouldn't fit.  I asked two other people to try.  No luck.  These are going right back to Amazon today, the very day I received them.",1,1,2020-2-8,1,1,0
"I just got these earbuds and I definitely already love them over my Skullcandy Indys. The Indys would constantly fall out of my ear and have connection problems. Within just setting up the Tozos they connect almost instantly and stay in my ears! There’s a little picture that shows you how to wear them effectively, and I definitely recommend looking at the picture. I was wearing them upside down for the first few minutes. Overall I’m super excited about these though!",5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"Buy these ear buds. I am an audio visual manager in Florida and I work with sound everyday. Not to mention I work as an audio engineer on my spare time. I’m always around audio. These earbuds are phenomenal. They pair & un pair so easily. I use them to listen to music, take phone calls, listen to podcasts and even mix instrumentals! They are durable the charging case is the perfect size. The noise cancellation is great. I haven’t had a bad experience with them yet. All the touch commands work as the manual states them. Truly an unbelievable product for the price get these for your friends, family, neighbors etc. You won’t regret it. Don’t buy over priced earbuds when you can get quality ones for a fraction of the cost.",5,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
So it was so highly rated and I read a lot of reviews. Now that I’m home full time with my daughter I needed some cordless earbuds for work and play. I’m glad I read them because if you want them to stay in your ears follow the instructions and make sure you have the right size. Also pairing was easy. They are attractive and sleek and the price can’t be beat. I just got them so I don’t know about battery life but I will update when I do.,5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,1
"Sound quality is pretty good while it works, but the left ear bud works sometimes but if I adjust it even slightly, it will stop working.  The microphone is completely useless.  Does not work well.Update:  apparently I had a defective pair.  Customer service contacted me and said they would send me another pair.",5,1,2020-8-30,1,1,0
"These earphones were highly rated and they did not disappoint. Sound quality and noise cancelling is really good. I would have given 5 stars but my only problem is I wanted them for working out, cycling, walking, running and I also leave in a pretty windy area. The sensor was responding to the wind when outside and messing with my music. Now I'm just using them for indoors, which works.",4,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
"These headphones are absolutely STELLAR. I literally never leave the house without them. 🙉  the noise cancellation is crazy good & the sound quality is amazing. They last such a long time too!!! :) they've never died on me during the times I use them, and I leave them charging during class so they're always charged for a long time afterwards. I HIGHHHHLLYYY recommend trying them out!! Plus they're waterproof!! 🌊 I never have to worry about wearing them out when it rains :)",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
Amazing little earbuds for a more than reasonable price. Trued other brands and these were superior in most cases and just as good in other. The price was almost always less than half the price of the others.I love these so much that I have a pair for the gym and a pair at work. I'm an accountant and listen to music and audiobooks so I don't perish from boredom. Being wire free has changed my whole work while listening process.,5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"I've always been skeptical of earbuds being useful for anything aside from lounging. These stick in your ear comfortably and have withstood a few biking and gym sessions so far. I have yet to drain the battery in a single session since the carrying case holds extra charge and I store them there when not in use. The sound is good, although I'm admittedly not audiophile. The noise cancellation isn't up to par with an over the ear headset (I have a QC15 BOSE Headset for comparison), but it will shut out your coworkers. Definitely recommended for the price.",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
Excellent quality product for this price range. Usually you get what you pay for in electronics. But in my opinion I feel I really got every feature I wanted and more. Plus the quality of materials seem great so far as well. I can’t ask for more than that. Honestly very surprised by how good these are even with the great reviews I read before purchasing.,5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"Shocked at how great these sound for a $30 pair of headphones! Also, a super plus that it's both stereo and works with just one earbud in. And they seem to stay put without any issues. The wireless pairing was also super easy with both my phone and laptop. There is a little outside noise that comes in, but for my purposes, I prefer that since I like to be at least slightly aware of my surroundings! :) Haven't used them long enough to know about battery life, but with the quality of the other elements, I have no reason to be concerned.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"I've had these earbuds for about a week now and used them multiple times in the shop and the gym.  I am very pleased with them.  Once in my ears they stay put.  Can't ask for anything else in a true wireless earbud.  Like the fact that the charging case is small, charges wirelessly and you can wear 1 earbud at a time if you want.  They are a fantastic pair of earbuds.  If anything changes, I will update my review.",5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"I've never had any other wireless buds so I really don't have a good reference on battery. Other than that.  They work..  that's about all I can say, even with the smallest tips they work out of my ears sitting at a desk. They sound decent, I'm coming from studio monitor buds so they don't compare. If this is the price point you want to spend, I'd say do it. But they won't amaze. You get what you pay for in audio",4,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"I loved em. The Tozo T6 is technically an older model but I loved the quality of sound I got with my music. I can shower in these and not worry, however if a good drop of water hits a bud, it can be detected as a tap and pause your song. But these babies do it man. You wont hear much but your own tunes and they are so simple to operate while maintaining comfort. They fell out once but that was after a a couple of hours! They hold up nice",5,1,2020-6-10,1,1,0
"Finally a pair of wireless earbuds that I can use, I’m in Love. I have tried multiple brands, sizes, everything out there and none would stay in place and would fall out with the slightest movement, so using at the gym impossible UNTIL I tried the TOZO T6  they fit perfectly and I don’t have to worry about them falling out or even shifting for that matter. I can listen to MY music without hearing any of the noises around.  So easy to use as well. The price is perfect.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
I really like them. However the volume control DOESN'T  work on calls as it hangs up on people. Volume control works on listening to music. I need it to work on calls because I'm almost 1% deaf.

"Sound quality is good but they are too big for my ear they look silly. Very disappointed as it suddenly disconnects without even touching it and the left earbud is really hard to pair, tried disconnecting it and trying to pair again, only the right one works! Unfortunately I purchased 2, white one for me which looks cheap and black 1 as a gift. Also the left earbud keeps flashing a red light while the right one is steady when I put it in the case,  does that mean there is a problem with the left one that's why it's not working?!",3,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"I did not want to do a review until I get real use to them. The sound is real nice with good bass which I look for. They work well with my iphone on calls, listening to music, and playing games.

I get great usage of them from every charge. The design and packaging also impresses me being in the creative business.",5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"I'm new to this type of earpiece, so I  already love the sound, talking on the phone, some people can hear me others need me to talk louder and can still hear background noise, so that part is a little annoying.

"When you often buys off-brand items, you can get start to expect certain things at specific price points. At around 50 dollars, these headphones have surprised me, at least with the quality of presentation. They clearly took notes from more expensive brands, and applied the techniques rather well. The headphones come with very sleek case that can charge while not being plugged in and a decent array of earbud size options. The only issue with what it comes with is that it uses micro-usb for charging, not a significant problem, but one that can be a bit annoying. Overall the sound quality is nice and having a 6-hour battery is a plus. The only thing I cannot comment on is longevity.",4,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0
"Do use are decent headphones, you get what you pay for with these. They are not super loud and the sound quality is not comparable to the Apple AirPods. But with that being said these are still decent headphones to wear and listen to music on for the price range and still be completely wireless.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
"So I purchased this in hope of having a nice pair of wireless headphones. They really didn’t turn out as good I expected! I have used this brand before. I have the TOZO-T10 and they were great! But I wanted to upgrade to something newer and a bit better and these really didn’t perform like I was expecting. When you have them on, it sounds pretty quiet or like the were submerged under water. They look nice but there is low sound and no bass at all... Makes me very sad! Maybe the company can contact me @ Dhill12408@gmail.com",2,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"This is a great wireless earbuds, it’s simple, clean looking, battery life is about 5 hours and an extra 15 hours in the pod. One of the neat features is the magnet when your charging it. The pod is very small and compact, fits very nicely in your pocket or backpack, I’m very pleased with this product and I may buy another one for my wife",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,1
I liked the sound quality and noise cancelling effect a Lot ! The touch functions work with dry/oil free fingers only :-)Edit: after less than a month of use i have found out that these earbuds are worth the money at all. The touch hardly works and they feel unpleasant in my ears. Another thing is that they randomly disconnect while playing music sometimes. It’s not  happened too many times but still annoying.,2,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0
"Love, love, love! Wasn’t sure about all the glowing reviews, but I am HIGHLY satisfied with these earbuds in “Rose Gold”. The color is actually more a beautiful frosted pink (which I love!). No problem whatsoever with volume being too low, as other reviews note.Now I hope I still find these in great working condition 1-2 years down the line, so I’ll see. Definitely recommend this product!",5,1,2020-2-19,1,1,1
"I love the sound and the simple controls. I had trouble getting them to stay in my ears with the provided attachments, but I had some foam earbud attachments that work perfectly for me.Update: I was floating around in a pool for about an hour this weekend when I discovered I had left my Tozo case and headphones in one of hidden pockets. I figured the headphones would be ruined, and even if they still worked, the charger would be toast. But much to my surprise, I opened the case and it was still dry inside. I pulled out the headphones. Completely dry. I left the charger overnight then put the headphones back in the next day and the charger was still working. Great product!",5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
Works great so far but now one is having an issue needing to pair over and over. I'll let you know how well they handle customer support later.. Great sound quality and clear conversations..

"Just pulled these out of the box. They had some charge so it was good to be able to try them immediately.  They paired immediately and without issue. I had to switch out the rubber earbud cap. After that, they fit comfortably. I'm going to see how long this initial charge lasts. I have the case charging but it came at least half way charged. Initial impression is good.",4,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"The sound quality, the pairing, the charging are all pretty great.  But pausing and skipping songs every time I tried to adjust my buds are super annoying!!  I would rather cancel the touch feature and just control everything through my phone to trade with the touch function.  These are great headphones besides that.",3,1,2020-7-26,1,0,1
"I got these to replace a set of old corded earbuds that died. They work great, sound fine, and stay in my ears well. I can wear them while mowing the lawn without any issues.The touch sensors are finicky and I can't get them to do what they are supposed to do.",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
These are comfortable and effective. I haven't had any problems with them falling out of my ears; it would be better if the pads were removable (I have small ears and usually change the ear plug pad to a smaller one) but these are very comfortable!Manufacturer quickly sent me a new pair when one side stopped working properly 2 months after my return window closed. Very pleased also with the amazon customer service that helped me through the process.,4,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
Love these except they occasionally fall out of my ear. There is not a case that I have found that will hold these like AirPods. I would like to have a way to hook these to something because I don’t carry a purse. Many times these have fallen out of my pocket when I go to the bathroom. I wish it was clearer on how to answer and hang up phone calls.,4,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
These ear buds are awesome.  I cannot get over how much bass they have.  I love that the case can just be set on one of my wireless chargers that I have for my phone.  There is a great selection of replaceable ear adapters if you have smaller or larger ear holes.  I liked these so much I bought my wife a set.,5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"I was going to buy the newest Jaybirds after my last pair stopped charging, but decided to give these a chance instead.  What a great decision.  The build quality on these is fantastic, the charging case is great, the sound quality is better than my old Jaybirds AND they cost over $100 less.  I honestly don't know how Jaybird is selling any headphone with these on the market.",5,1,2020-7-27,1,1,0
So far so good. I was looking for earbuds without spending a ton. I heard good things and ordered right away. They come with lots of sizing options and the case seems to work and charge well.Update.

These are very nice headphones for the price. I didn't want to spend a ton considering how minimal they would be used.

I have used these for a day. So far seems great. I like that there were different size ear pieces so that I could get the perfect fit. Sound quality seems good and noise canceling works well.

"I was buying these to because they were one of the cheapest wireless earbuds with a charging case and didn't have the annoying airpod/qtip form factor. They turned out to be surprisingly good for the price.  These were super easy to pair, with decent sound quality. Build quality is better than I expected. There's no noise cancellation, but the sound isolation is good.These aren't high quality audiophile level earbuds, but they are a great everyday set that you won't panic if you misplace then.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
"Overall, I enjoy the quality of the sound as well as the multiple earpieces set that it comes with the earbuds which greatly help in finding your size. The range of the earbuds is immense and I am able to still maintain a steady connection from across my house! As you can tell by the title, these are water-resistant and not designed to actually be used underwater as the water will cause sound interference and may actually damage the earbuds. I did have one faulty earbud and emailed the company of the earbuds and they offered me a replacement as well as USB-c charger and case with it! I really enjoy these earbuds and hope to see how long they will truly last.",5,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
I researched a lot and wanted to believe a $50 pair could be as good as a $150+ pair. I’m all about spending less but still getting quality. These did not disappoint. Touch instructions could be better but a quick YouTube search explained it well and the touch controls really work! Sound is great! Noise cancelling is about 75% in my opinion. Overall I’m very happy with this purchase.,5,1,2020-3-12,1,0,0
"These are some very Dynamic earbuds. Sound is amazing. Nice Bass. You can hear phone calls clear and Loud. The noise cancelling is good.

These are Beyond excellent for the overall price. the product surprise me very much, in a good way.

I highly suggest these earbuds u really won't be disappointed.",5,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
Definitely one the best wireless ear buds out there for the price. Super happy with this purchase. I've used them on a few airplane flights so far and they have been crystal clear while on the plane. The fact that the case also acts as a portable charger is a huge plus. These will easily last a while day or two of traveling without needing to hook the case up to a charger.They sit in my ear very well and the fit is secure. If an airpod type design doesn't fit in your ear then these are definitely for you.,5,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
"Surprised how well these fit once I swapped for the smallest adapter cups. I have tiny ear canals and most in-ear headphones/pods fall out. These are working great, even when I ride my mountain bike. Great sound quality, especially for this price. The controls are a little weird, I find myself accidentally turning them on and off a lot when I touch them. But it's not a major issue. I like that they don't dangle down my ear like air-pods.",5,1,2020-3-16,1,0,1
I really like this product and it is super helpful considering my daughter wakes up if I have the tv on or am using my phone. Easy to use and truly wireless. Also I really like the look of it.I had the t10 before we lost them in a move so far I don’t see too much difference other than the t6 case is smaller and came with more earbud sizing options.,5,1,2020-5-1,1,1,0
"Received this product quickly and packaged well. When I took it out, the left ear bud easily and quickly paired with the bluetooth on my phone. Was good for a phone call and listening to music. Unfortunately, the right sided ear bud has not been working. I contacted the manufacturer with the email on the instruction manual, and they responded within less than 24 hours and offered to replace the right earbud right away. Very good response time and communication. I am looking forward to receiving the right ear bud and it seems that this will be a very good product once I have all the working pieces.

These buds sound so much better than I had expected! The bass is deep and rich. Miss and highs are clear.

"Fantastic value for the price. Works great, snug fit, simple touch controls, battery charging case, can use the ear buds independently which I prefer for audio books and having one ear aware of my surroundings. Great sound quality, good call quality, killer waterproofing rating. Incredible for the price. The unit is a little bulky aesthetically compared to some others but not for the quality and features, compares well, fits so snuggly in ear, the pink is a great color also. It's a subtle pinkish color. Only had them one day. Happy they offer an extended 18 month warranty also. So worth it already.",5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0

I wasn't too impressed with the sound until a song with some bass came on and then, I knew that they would get a lot of use. They have a great sound level. Not too high or low. Very very respectable sound, great fit (I have big ears and they fit perfectly), the battery lasts for hours... Great purchase!",5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
"... But there is no nose cancellation. You can hear wind and people talking in the background. Very distracting. They are great for just listening to music. Talking on the phone, not so much.

"I had no idea how much i needed touch head phones in my life until I got these. I originally ordered them because  they were waterproof and I needed some good sturdy ones for working out becuase I sweat alot and all of the other headphones I kept buying would break or fall out of my ears. But THESE stay in plus you can skip to the next song, restart it, control the volume and even answer or hang up phone calls just  by touching them. So far I've used them three days in a row without charging them for the entire time I've been studying for finals and they still havent needed any charging!  Also i did'nt realize how much they cancel out noise until my family was in my face talking to me and I couldn't even hear them without any music on.

Give me a button! Sound quality not great compared to over the ear ones (I have come to learn). If you have big fingers you will never get them out of their charger, either.

I am surprised at how many tips the headset comes with. I'm glad it came with small ones because they come out of my ear and just float there without them. Sound is amazing on these pods. The bass is really nice and I'm shocked. Too bad I mostly listen to audio books not music. Battery life I can't comment on yet and will have to check at a later date.,5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
"I love the earbuds. They are easy to charge, the sound quality is fantastic and I love how easy it is to store them.  This is the real deal for such a good price. I bought them in the color pink and they look soooo cool. My daughter and son in law bought theIr earphones from Apple and paid much more for the same quality. Even they were shocked at the quality! If you are looking for earbuds that look good, charge well and have the same Bluetooth capabilities as the Apple earphones, THIS IS IT. And.... I saved a lot of money. This was my after Christmas present to myself.",5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
"I am satisfied with the sound quality and comfort of these earbuds.  They’re also easy to pair with your devices.  Sorry this review isn’t as extensive or hype as it should be, I’m not that kind of person.  All I can say is that I feel like I did not wasted my money buying this.",5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"These things are Awesome!!!!!! I bought myself 2 pairs 1 for working out and working around the house and the other for work. I work in construction and around loud equipment these things work great for noise canceling and still hearing crisp sound. Great quality. I got my wife a pair and she loves them. Our kids want a pair and I believe we will get them each a pair, it has the different size ear pieces so each will have a perfect fit. They are lightweight and they stay in place even when sweating. If you are looking for all around great earbuds Look no further you will not be disappointed.",5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
I love these! Awesome value for the price. I have been using them almost everyday. The battery life is great as is the sound quality. I would say I would not consider them to be noise cancelling as they are advertised. Very please I got these rather than spending the money on air pods.,5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"I love the Tozo t6s. The sound quality is excellent and an great substitute for the Apple AirPods. I do have to say that Tozo support is also excellent. About six months after I started using my pair, the left earbud was having issues and support was excellent. They answer my complaint and assisted with trying to correct the issue. After it was clear that a simple fix was not feasible; they sent me a replacement pair.",5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"I been searching for headphones for awhile now. I was debating between Galaxy bud or TOZO headphones and I decided to pull the trigger on these. I am glad I did, I love how they fit perfectly in my ear and sound quality is awesome.The battery life is great I haven't charged my buds or the case and I have been using them for the past two days.",5,1,2019-10-27,1,0,0
"I previously owned the T10s but lost them on a recent trip. I saw the case for this pair was smaller and that the batter life was longer, and I have been especially pleased with those features. The price is unbeatable compared to air pods, and the noise cancellation is excellent just like the T10. The IPX8 waterproof rating is better than most bluetooth speakers and they're durable. The range on the headphones is pretty rad, so the sound won't cut out. Good for running.They also come with a 1-year hassle free warranty so I feel pretty secure with the purchase.",4,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"Head phones are awesome! I run frequently and can be EXTREMELY sweaty when running or working or in general. So I wanted something that would stick in my ears (they are kind of small) and give me good quality. These headphones did both. My left earbud stopped charging properly about 2 weeks ago. I tried everything the Internet offered.  To no avail I couldn’t get the left ear bud to charge, thus it would die 3 minutes into my workout.  After exhausting google search I reached out to TOZO directly explaining my frustration. They offered to send me another pair of head phones at no charge to me. I hope these last as they have been wonderful so far!",4,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"It's the perfect size to carry with you and the battery life is pretty long, I use them frequently and only have to charge once a week. I had other wireless earbuds before and these are much better and the quality is fantastic. I use them to run and workout and the connectivity is great, don't have to worry about them dying after an hour or two of continuous music. Also the touch commands are extremely sensitive but easy to use and I can change the volume or song mid run which is amazing and exactly what I wanted them to do.I don't love the way they fit in my ears but I think I haven't used the right ear piece addition.",5,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
The quality of the earbuds is great and if it's perfectly in my ear. I bought these earbuds so I can use them while I work out in the gym. If it snug and they stay on and a good addition is all the exercises of the earbuds that come with it. The battery life is great too and when I'm done with my workout I can put it back in its pod and it recharges again. One thing I didn't like about it is that every time I need to adjust my earpiece it actually pauses because of the touch feature but other than that I'm happy with what I got for the price.,5,1,2020-10-3,1,0,0
These are awesome! My husband had a set that I got him. He is extremely picky.  Does not usually like to wear headphones. He was starting chemo and needed some for hospital stays. He absolutely loves them. He also issued them to talk on the phone for work calls. He loved them so much I got a pair and his Dad did too.I recommend them to everyone I know. Would make great gifts!,5,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"I just received this item so I may come back to update.... Shipping was super fast and arrived as promised... The earbuds are struggling to pair to my computer.... not sure why and if I cant figure it out I will return.... connected quickly to new phone and music sound ok... A little to quiet for my tastes, but battery life is excellent! Will update computer issue",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"I've been using these off and on for a few months. I love the wireless option. So convenient. Then yesterday, the sound went down. Meaning, everything turned into a whisper no matter how loud I had my device set. I unfortunately can no longer use them, I can't hear the sound on the other end.They were amazing while I had them though! I'm sad to return them. Maybe it was a fluke? I will return them and hopefully they will evaluate and get ahead of this if it's a new problem.",2,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"I am just blown away by these earbuds. I am able to use just one if need be. I like using the left earbud while keeping my right open in case someone needs my attention. I’ve had them both on and truly cancels the outside noise, hence the one earbud. So worth the money. The touch feature is cool. As for calls, the quality is clear. No issues with connectivity at all. I am very happy with this purchase. The quality of these earbuds are phenomenal.",5,1,2020-3-6,1,0,1

So far the suit my needs just fine. The sound is plenty loud enough for me and I use these mostly for housework and such so I don’t have a lot of fancy sound requirements. I do wish that they had more detailed instructions in the packaging therefore I suggest that you to go to YouTube.,4,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
"At first glance this product is nice; well packaged and seemingly well constructed, but they missed the mark on two main things:-The touch 'feature' is completely annoying.  When picking up the second earbud to put in my ear, it commanded lots of random things for my phone to do.  Don't touch these things at all if you want to enjoy them.",1,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
"Bought these  a while back. They are not expensive and work wonderfully. While wearing, then removing my COVID mask, I got myself into a pickle - totally my fault. When I contacted them about it, they rescued me. They really didn't have to.A really wise teacher once said this: ""Trust is the Breath of business, ethics its Limbs, to uplift the Spirit, its goal"". The TOZO folks clearly believe that. GOOD FOR THEM!!",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"These are the second set of in ear wireless headphones I have owned. They fit securely in my ears but do cause a bit of discomfort after extended use. Aside from that the sound quality is excellent as is the battery life. It seems the noise cancellation is mainly due to the fact that they plug your ears well, you can barely here anything once outside your head when you have them in. My typical use is for the gym and running, interesting in testing them in the pool when it warms up. Would definitely recommend to others.",4,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
"There were two major surprises with these headphones. The sound quality was the biggest surprise. These headphones are better than my wired headphones by a country mile.The second thing is how well they stay in my ears. I was expecting them to constantly fall out of my ears, which has not happened.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"Overall I really like it, they’re not too big. My only complaint are the rubber parts you can change out. None of them were small enough for my ear so I had to use some from another brand....",1,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"This would be the 2nd set of wireless ear buds I’ve bought from this company. My first I ended up giving to my nephew back in 2018 and this is the replacement. The case is slimmer, the battery lasts longer, and I was able to pair the earbuds without reading the instructions. In fact the only reason I’m writing this review is after activating the year warranty, I was given the option of writing a review and maybe getting a wireless charging plate. In fact that would be my only gripe; the lid that covers the connecter for charging the case is hard to open - I haven’t yet opened mine yet because the case came with enough battery juice. If I don’t get that wireless charging pad and I have to use a knife to open the charging port I’ll be so pissed.",5,1,2020-2-24,1,0,0
"The pink one arrived today because my wife heard the black one  (mine, in the pink box) and demanded that I get her one as well (but in 'pink').This is easily the best buds I have ever bought! Is there a downside? Yes...removing the buds from the cradle but I've learned a good way to do it.",5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,1
"I am pleasantly pleased with this purchase.While using it at the fitness center, I walked away from my phone and it kept connection from across the room.  I also used them for a handsfree phone call.  They said my voice was clear.",5,1,2020-3-11,1,1,0
"I LOVE these earbuds! After reading and watching reviews on numerous bluetooth earbuds I decided these sounded like the most bang for my buck. Boy was I right! The value is great. I love the case that they come with, and that it's compatible with wireless charging. The sound quality is great. A couple reviews I watched said they didn't get loud enough, but they get PLENTY loud enough for me. They are great for listening to music or podcasts at work or whatever you need them for.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0

"I have had these earbuds for 6 months now and I love them so much!  I just can believe how reasonably priced they are compared to other earbuds for IPhones.  The sound quality is excellent and I can run them for about 6 to 6.5 hours before I need to charge them. The case charges them very quickly. If the case itself needs a recharge, I can fully charge it in under an hour.  These earbuds easy paired with my phone and immediately connect every time I turn them on or remove them from the charging case.  Don’t waste money on earbuds that cost $200, buy these instead!",5,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"The sound quality on these things is amazing. I've had Air Pods before and they pale in comparison to these in terms of clearness of audio and noise-cancelling capabilities. Best part is that these come with multiple inserts to fit your ears and I find them extremely comfortable. Pairing with my phone and laptop was a breeze. All in all, I'm very pleased.",5,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"After initial set up and use everything worked fine for about 30 minutes.  Then one of the earbuds stopped working, charging light would still go on when put into the case.  We followed the instructions on how to reset them about 10x while checking every time after to see if it would start working.  Contacted the seller to ask about a refund or getting a replacement as this was a gift for a family member who was very excited to get the wireless headphones, the seller did not respond.For anyone reading this I recommend that you save your money for items that actually work or with sellers who have the decency to respond when you contact them about the product they sold you being defective.",1,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
Great buds!  I've tried many products like this and this by far has great sound quality and the noise cancellation is excellent without having to increase the volume to where it hurts your ears.I've yet to master how to correctly work these as there's a lot of tapping involved.  I'll reach out to customer service to do this.  These do tend to fall out of my ears though again it may be that I'm putting them in the wrong way.  These have fallen out of my ears into water and as promised they are definitely water proof.,5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,1
"TOZO the upgrade is phenomenal. Pairs quickly out the box! Sound quality is excellent. The fit is super snug. I had the older version and lost one.

"I normally don't write reviews, but I was severely disappointed in these wireless headphones. I purchased these mainly to be hands-free while I'm currently working from home. The music quality was not terrible, but the main use of these headphones were for making phone calls. The volume on the calls were much, much lower than the music volume I normally listen to; I spent a good part of my time asking people to repeat themselves because my volume was at max, but everything still sounded muffled. I also dealt with them disconnecting and re-connecting frequently.Honestly, save your money for a few months and purchase a better qualify of headphone. That's definitely what I plan on doing with my refund.",2,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"I got these and was excited to use, but the very first walk on went on with them the sound would drop out if I put my iPod in my hip pouch--got no sound at all. I had to have the iPod in my hand to even get a reception between the iPod and the earbuds and even then if I swung my arm even just a little too wide the sound would drop out again. Very disappointed and am returning these ASAP.",1,1,2020-4-13,1,1,0
I had the T10 headphones and loved them hated that I couldn't control the volume. The T6 solbe that problem and many more I enjoy the touch technology over the tactile buttons as with buttons I'd always shove the earbud into my ear and it was uncomfortable. These have a better battery life than the T10s and they are smaller I love the new case! Highly recommend these.,5,1,2020-4-23,1,0,0
"What a surprise... I am so pleased with these earbuds and the sound quality. I expected not to get much for the price however these are wonderful. I read some of the reviews before and figured with over 17,000 positive reviews they couldn’t be bad, but I never expected this quality for this price.",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"I'm very impressed with the quality of the earbuds for the price. Sound quality is even more impressive and I'm very pleased with the fit and finish of the earbuds themselves. The case is good too, but one concern I have is long term use - the hinge on the case top seems a bit fragile so we'll have to see how it holds up. Otherwise these things are great so far - pairing took less than a minute with my Iphone7 plus. One quick note is that my initial pairing attempt I did not read the instructions and did not verify that BOTH earbuds were turned on and blinking. But it was a super easy fix - I disconnected them from the phone, put the buds in the case - then pulled them back out, made sure both were on and blinking red and blue then reconnected to my phone. Done.",5,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
"Great truly wireless earbuds for the price. I really like the fit. They fit down into your ear canal better than most ear buds do, resulting in a snugger first and better noise cancellation. I’m not some audiophile snob, so I think they sound just fine to me. Don’t expect Bose quality for a mid range price. Personally, I just use mine casually at the office, so I couldn’t say how well they stay in place during a workout. The touch controls are very sensitive and easy to use once you get it figured out. They can be a touch too sensitive sometimes. The only problem I have had is that I was listening to music sitting right next to my phone and I lost connection for no known reason, but it did reconnect with a few seconds. All in all, I am very pleased with these earbuds and would recommend them to others.",5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"Great earbuds at a wonderful price! The sound is great, I can talk on them with no issues and the noise cancelling works well. When one fell out and wouldn’t work, Jude from the TOZO customer service team responded quickly to address my issue and sent me a replacement earbud at no cost. Jude communicated with me via email, which was very convenient. He was super friendly and very helpful. Highly recommend these earbuds!",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
These are the first wireless earbuds I have ever bought and I love them!

"These headphones were great for about 5 months. I got the charging pad and noticed after sometime that the pad would actually heat up the tozo battery case a lot and stopped using it, but it seems the pad may ave burned out the battery and now the battery wont charge and i cant charge my headphones. For what its worth the headphones seem great but the pad they get you to buy with it might damage the battery.  So dont get the charging pad, charge it regularly.",4,1,2020-10-4,1,0,1
When this product worked it sounded great! Unfortunately there was an issue with the Bluetooth connection and it continously dropped the right headphone. No matter how many times I tried setting it back to factory default it would not stay connected properly. I am returning the product as defective.The company has contacted me and has offered me the opportunity to give these headphones a second chance. I am looking forward to this and will be updating my review after receiving and using the new headphones. I have changed my rating from 1 to 3 stars. most companies wont take the time to contact you. It shows they care.,3,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0

They come with several different sized ear cushions for a custom fit and feel snug and secure in my ear.  Very pleased with my purchase.,5,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
These earbuds have great sound quality and noise cancellation features.  They come in a charging case with residual charge for about 3 to 4 chargings before needing to recharge the charging case.

I’ve been through many ear buds and this by far at the best. The sound is good. Paring first run was a breeze and even when I use one or the other alone it pairs automatically. The battery does seem to last the advertised amount and the case is very compact and convenient shape. Ear buds are something that could be lost easily no matter what brand but having the case and always return to case makes it much easier to keep track. Even if I do loose them I could by 4 of these for the price that other brand goes for.,5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0

"Great product, which I bought after much research and deliberation. I wanted a pair to test out how much I would use them, and didn't want to break the bank. They have performed fantastically, I wear them for a multitude of applications, and haven't been disappointed. The touch sensor is a bit sensitive for my liking, but if you can get a good initial fit, you will not be touching them unnecessarily. I highly recommend these.",4,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
"I bought this for my computer, when I got them my computer could not connect to them. Probably fixable so I sent an email to the company no phone number for help 3 days later and 2 more emails no response!! So I got on amazon's chat help. Now that was a treat, 1 hour and 10 minutes of my time wasted so some ass could read me the directions!!!  I am returning, buy from a reputable company then you can get help when you need it.",1,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"I received my order of T6 Earbuds today after ordering last night through Amazon. The package included a charger, cord, earbud adapters, earbuds, and instruction manual. I placed the earbuds in the charging case and connected to my laptop for charging. About an hour and a half later, I found the earbuds fully charged as indicated by the 4 indicator lights on the charging case. I placed the earbuds in my ears without any adapter and experienced a snug fit. I listened to some smooth jazz and found the sound well-balanced between treble and bass. Good comfortable fit, appealing sound, and great price. TOZO has gained another satisfied customer!",5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
"Why spend $150 on Apple earbuds when you can get better quality than Apple for a 1/3rd of the cost.The connection is fast and easy, it charges while in the case which is a great feature but better than all these features I love the ability to wear them in the hot tub and listen to my podcasts while they get soaked and survive it like a champ.",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"Just received it today. And I tried it for a few hours and I'm very satisfied with the sound quality. Definitely better than I expected. Case feels great, the earbuds are very comfortable. The bass it's no over powering, it perfect for me. I tried running with it an it didn't fall. Very happy with my purchase. Great sound, quality and best of all price.",5,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
"I got these earbuds because the pair of Blackwebs I got from Walmart had a tendency of hijacking my phone’s bluetooth with communistic aggression and so far these do not do that, they actually yield to my cars bluetooth when my phone is connected. My only gripe is that there can be a little bit of a lag in pushing the button and the earbuds responding other than that amazing",4,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"I honestly think the sound quality on this is better than the AirPods. Although I love the look of AirPods, these suit my lifestyle so much better. Its noise cancelling so great for public transport, travel and studying. There's a small touchscreen interface which works better than the AirPods and is also super user friendly. Great for working out, love the  feel of these and I don't have to readjust them. You can also take a shower in these (I personally haven't tried it yet but will soon) too!Only reason why I'm docking a star is probably how it looks on me. I'm just not used to it, it sticks out way more than I'd like it to, and my ears are pretty small. Changing the silicone earplugs wasn't easy either but I figured it out.",4,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"I think eeally amazing for the price.  Wireless charging, easily connects, stays connected, found perfect fit.  Only with it came with USBC charging port instead of micro-USB.  5 star overall because 4-star across the board at this price is pretty good!",5,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0
"Unfortunately if you are like me and have ears on the smaller size, these won't be useful. I have the smallest attachments in which are still large but that isn't even the issue. The main black part barely fits in the ear shell like in the pictures. I went for a walk yesterday and they kept falling out. Also, I randomly get sound skipping from time to time where it sounds like a skipping record (fully charged, no unusual contact etc to cause it). The features to move forward, rewind, turn up and down etc are all good, just wish they fit.",3,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"These headphones are fantastic for the price. They come with many different sizes of ear pads. Once I found the right one, they stay in my ears comfortably and don't cause pain or fatigue in the ears. The noise reduction of the microphone is not the greatest. The people I have had in virtual conferences have said they can hear a lot of noise from my headphones and people talking in the other room. I do wish they would correct that. Other than that, they are fantastic, battery lasts a long time, and are comfortable to wear.",4,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0
I use them almost every day at work.  Only problem is I have to take them out of my ear if i need to listen to someone.  Hard to hear someone talking to you.  Update: I misplaced them so i bought a second pair.  I am very happy with them.  The battery lasts and charges quick.,5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"Seeing that they ask to put a good review in on the product in order to activate the extended warranty seems a bit shady, but I'll come back when I have a chance to actually USE the earbuds.  To be continued...... ok, these things are really good.  Lots of different sizes for the earbud, really good sound, quick and automatic connectivity, they're exactly what I wanted.  Comfortable and very light.  You can move around as much as you want with these in and you don't notice they're there, and they don't come loose at all.",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"These are good ear buds for walking around the house/maybe the neighborhood.  DO NOT get them for exercise unless you have perfect ears for ear buds.  They will fall out. Also, tried them in the shower and they would not stay in. It's possible that I just have strangely shaped/sized ears and they would work better for everyone else though.  That being said, they're definitely good for listening to music in bed/while walking around the house.",4,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0
"Mainly bought these because they were waterproof, but the fact is, that in the shower, the touch pads automatically get activated by the water and either shut off the ear buds, or blast the volume, or lower it to complete silence.  They also disconnect at random times more than i would expect. Overall not terrible and have redeeming qualities but not what i was looking for, nor needing, and the return period is not long so i cant even return them.",1,1,2020-6-28,1,1,0
"I recently had my T10 stolen on campus, fortunately for me it looked like there was a new and improved earbud available! The 20% coupon made it even better. I immediately put the T6 in my ears and the sound quality really showed improvement. I workout  and run alot so I was really excited to see that it had touch skip and pause features. I would definitely recommend these to any android users like myself, or iphone users that don't want to spend $200+ for airpods.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"These are a great headphones specially for the price range. The case is very study and compact. The magnet to hold the earbuds inside the case feels very strong, and the case lid closes nicely.I also liked the package - not that is that important, but gives a sense of higher quality.",5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,1
"I really enjoy these headphones, the sound quality is great.  They feel sturdy and well-made.  I ordered the white, they came in a box with black earbuds on it which made me think that they had sent me the wrong ones but when I opened it the white were inside.  Great packaging, aside from the picture not matching what's inside.  The earbud covers that go in your ear have many to choose from which is great for a secure fit.  1 year warranty which is a nice touch. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because for a female they are a little large for our ears, I wish they sat flush in the ear, but at this price point it is hard for something to meet all of your needs.  Overall, these are a really great buy!",4,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
"The T-6 set was a gift for Father’s Day to replace a Plantronic set that had become unstable due to corrosion from sweat and time.  I would say that the sweat protection on the T-6’s is “MO-better” than the previous ear buds, and the sound quality is marginally better, but not by much.  The travel/charging case are a definite improvement and I find myself using the T-6’s for much “MO” than workouts, from Zoom to phone calls.For the price and the features, these were “no brainers” for me plus they travel with me as part of my everyday carry pieces.  I can’t see leaving home without these now!",4,1,2020-6-26,1,0,0
"No dislikes thus far.  I use this product for listening to talk radio and for use with phone conversations, primarily.  So far it has been very good.  The range is very good, they stay in my ears quite well and the sound quality for what I use them for is excellent.  When using as phone communication, they are clear and the recipients have no troubles hearing me speak.  Time will tell as I have only had them for 3 days.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"After returning some AirPod pro’s because they were way too expensive, I bought these. They were delivered quickly and were easy to pair with my iPhone and Apple Watch.  The sound is almost the same as my returned airpods. Which were almost $200 more! I highly recommend these.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0
The lows are phenomenal. The sound quality is ridiculous. I spend hours with these in just finding songs to listen to. The only problem I have is the touch sensitivity doesn't work all the time and the charging case has a problem where if i just wear one. The other one constantly pairs and unpairs. But for the money. A seriously dope set.,3,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
I have the Tozo T10 earbuds which I absolutely love. The only reason I got these was because I have small ear canals and the T10s are a tad bit snug. The T6 fit perfectly. The sound is amazing. Battery life is great. I also prefer the smaller charging case over the T10 one. The price is also great. I use these daily and cannot say enough good things about them! They are so easy to use. Get them! You won't regret it.,5,1,2020-6-9,1,1,0
"I liked the new case size better - it's flatter and fits nicer in pockets - Like the previous model, they work great, easy to sync with the phone and this T6 version has better sound in my opinion. I listened to different kind of music (classical/jazz) and the sound quality felt great. They fit nice in the ear and the trick is to rotate them in the ear canal - I love the waterproof feature - now if I go in the shower or around water I don't need to worry and if I want to continue to listen to podcast or music - I can just do it. I like the wireless charging also and tested the wire but use all wireless chargers. Since the earbuds are small their battery life is not the greatest but last a while and you can recharge them in their case very quickly.",5,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
"I bought these so I could listen to audiobooks and watch What I stream. While sound quality was good for my use, the controls where a big pain. Constantly changing things when I went to re adjust them. Also they would fail to connect to my IPhone constantly. Always had to connect them manually. When I use both, several times they were slightly out of sync with each other. Gave a slight echo to what I was listening to. I also found them hard to get out of the case on occasion due to the slick plastic.",2,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"We recently purchased the TOZO T6 Earbuds for our son and we couldn't be happier. Before choosing the TOZO T6, I researched (literally) dozens of earbud brands and models in all price ranges. The number of choices was overwhelming.  What sold me on the TOZO T6 was a combination of playtime, touch controls, ease of pairing, and wireless charging. The build quality is outstanding. It might sound funny, but the way the earbuds magnetically click into the case and the way the way the lid snaps close is very satisfying. We like the TOZO T6 so much we ordered another pair for our daughter!",5,1,2019-11-2,1,0,0
These paired very easily with my iPhone. I always steered away from these types of earbuds because I didn’t think they would stay in place but they stayed put through my workout. I haven’t had a chance to use them long enough to run the battery completely down but the battery life was more than sufficient for my use. These are very good earbuds for the price.,5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
"I love these earbuds. I've finally done it. I found earbuds that actually stay in my ears, and best of all, I can wear them for hours without my ears hurting. The sound is great. The bass really comes through, and brings full dimension to the sound. The battery life is even better. I wear these at work, and can get almost 8 hours out of 1 charge. The warranty is great as well. I recently had a problem with the right earbud losing its sound, and customer service first walked me through a few tips on how to possibly fox the problem at home. When that didn't work, they sent a new pair out. (I sent the broken ones back of course). Overall, great earbuds for a great price.",5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
These earbuds work great.  The battery life is excellent so far and the case charges the earbuds as soon as you put them back in the case.  The wireless charging of the case is awesome and convenient.  Bluetooth connection is super easy and you can use either headphone singularly if you want.  The fitment in my ear is also great and the box includes 5 more sets of the rubber ear pieces in all different sizes.  And the touch control is pretty cool; each side has different controls and they are easy to remember.  I was originally looking for a replacement of my old bluetooth earphones that were connected together and these fit the bill perfectly.  I highly recommend.,5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0
"These ear buds are great! They sound amazing & are super comfortable. They come with 6 different size ear bud caps so you can customize the fit.

"Surprisingly good for a budget friendly pair of true wireless earbuds. A friend and I were on the prowl for some and we didn’t have enough to cough up for air buds like Samsung’s Galaxy earbuds or Apple’s air buds so after a long night of hunting, we came across these headphones and we read the reviews. After taking a leap of faith, we ordered them and once we got them, I was shocked by the sound quality. The noise cancelling feature is subpar but the bass and how clear the music sounds is astounding for some cheap earbuds. Wish there could be a case for them though because I’d like to keep it protected as much as possible!!",5,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
"these are  knockoff EarPods. They aren’t very loud either. I keep finding myself pressing the volume up button. Touch feature, Wireless charging, 18 months of warranty, water resistant, pair-able with UHD Smart TVs makes the T6️⃣ a cheaper alternative to the EarPods",3,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"I usually don't care for earbuds, but after reading several reviews I decided to try them.  I must have an odd shaped ear, because they never seem to fit securely, but with the help of the many silicone tips included, I was able to find a near perfect fit.  The best (and to me the most important thing) is the sound.  These are great with crisp highs, and a great ""punch"" in the bass.  I don't know how they compare to ones costing several hundred dollars, but I can't imagine the sound in the ""top of the line"" ones being much better.  I am thrilled with the purchase, and would definitely buy again.",5,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0
"I'm only on day two with these ear buds. But the sound quality is great. They do make one of my ears itch. Don't know why. Maybe change size of peice. But no more ear clips!!! Battery life could be longer but I'm at my job for 12 hours a day. Do if I switch off and charge the other while I use one I'm good. Noise cancellation is not good. But again. I've bought at least a dozen bluetooths, and none of them have good noise cancellation. Unless you spend in the upper hundreds for a parrot. But for this price!! Major win.",5,1,2020-3-25,1,0,0
"The Tozo T6 has a crisp sound. The treble is sharp. The bass is not as deep as I would like, but still sounds great.  It’s just a preference, not a flaw.  The buds are particularly easy to set up. Out of the box they were paired with each other and my iPhone in seconds. The case is solid and has the feel of quality. They fit in my ears very comfortably, a light touch, but still snug. (Five extra ear pieces are provided.) I can wear them all day. I’m very pleased with these. I’m sold on Tozo, too.",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0

"The TOZO T6 are decent truly wireless in-ears for mixed usage. They last just over five hours off a single charge and their case provides an additional four charges. They're stable and comfortable enough to take to the gym, and you should be able to wear them for longer periods without feeling too much fatigue. Unfortunately, they won't help block out train or bus engine noises during your daily commute, though they'll help with blocking out background chatter. On the upside, their sound profile is fairly well-balanced, and they should be decently suited for a wide range of genres.Lastly, they're after-sale service is good and give you 5-star rating.",5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"I got this so I could discreetly listen to music at work. I have to say, after only initial testing, I'm pretty much in love with these already.

I also tested these in the shower and these worked perfectly!",5,1,2020-6-20,1,0,0

They are somewhat uncomfortable to wear. And yes, I have tried more than one size fitting and followed the instructions how to properly put them in my ears.The sound is quality is average, nothing special. Perhaps I was spoiled with my last set and I was expecting something similar in sound. Sometimes people have difficulty hearing me on the phone, and you only get decent base sounds if you really shove them into your ears and hope they stay in place. I can't say I would recommend these if you're used to better quality.",3,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"I use this product for working out and being able to hear my audio books, music and/or TV sound over the noise of the machines without waking up the whole family.

After a year of frustration of not being able to listen to music during indoor workouts i finally decided to give them a try. Based on the reviews I chose these and the price didn't scare me off.

"Got my TOZO T6 earbuds about two weeks ago, and they have been amazing! Works as well as airpods, but for a much better price. The sound quality is good, nothing exceptional, but one thing of note is these earbuds are capable of delivering high volumes (which is great for someone like me who enjoys blasting their music!). I really like the touch controls, although it is easy to accidentally press play/pause when adjusting the buds into your ear. I use my earbuds almost all day and they have yet to die on me.

After a month the sound was glitchy. I also had to charge them a few times even though I use them 1-2 a week and 1-2 hours at a time. I purchased a Boltune wireless headset that was $20 less and the sound and connection are great.,2,1,2020-7-9,1,1,0

I can’t speak to the bass sound because I use them for watching Netflix, podcasts, and phone calls. The sound quality for those is great! No one should ever waste their money on AirPods when there is an inexpensive option like this. The only thing I wish I could change is not being able to connect to more than one device at a time because I switch between my phone and tablet on a daily basis. But it’s so easy to connect the device it’s not really a problem.",5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
Great product - pairs very easily. Sounds great and comes with many different ear piece fittings.

These are fantastic. Sound quality is good. Sleek design. Battery life is excellent. I charged them and didn't use them for a week and they still had 3 dots of battery life. Also wireless charging!

Check out pics. Penny and chicky nug for size comparison.,5,1,2020-3-6,1,0,1
"These sound pretty darn good. Bass is there, pretty clear and articulate, you have to double in price before you get much better. Mids are there although a little thin, high end is there too, a little shimmery perhaps a little forward.

"I am exceedingly pleased with this product. After a couple days of usage I can say all features function as advertised, creating a comfortable and convenient experience. They stay in my ears well, which I was concerned about. The microphone worked well. The wireless charging is a fantastic feature and the price is just right. I'm not very sensitive to sound quality but they seem great for that too. I'd say noise cancellation is as good as any non-active cancelling that I've experienced, no complaints.",5,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"The earbuds are spectacular and exactly as described. Excellent quality in all. Haven't tested for waterproof but don't plan on using them underwater.

"I wanted some wire earbuds but didn’t want to pay a lofty $150 for the Apple ones. The sound quality on these are amazing. The functions are intuitive and effortless when it comes to the interface. My obky complaint is that they WONT STAY in my ear canals. I have weird tiny ear canals in general and even with the smallest ear cushion these pop out after 1 minute into my jog. I wish they made these for children or for small ear canals. Might have to return these. Really want them to workout, very unfortunate.",5,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"The sound was clear, pretty clear but not as premium quality as the 100$+ ones. connections and instructions are easy, the only drawback was that when u move around the earbuds feel like it's going to fall off (but it's not) which needs to take some time to get used to it. Pricewise I say its a deal. I will update this review after a few months where stuff like this usually shows their true color but right now overall I am pretty happy about it.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

They're a good pair for under $100 and I chose these over the bluetooth beats earphones when there was a discount. Only problem I have with these are that they constantly slip out of my ears despite putting them on the correct way. Especially while doing tasks around the house. I do have small ears and they're a little big for them as well. I haven't been able to find any bluetooth earphones so far that fits into my ears snugly, and unfortunately these aren't the ones.

They have okay sound ranges and okay battery life but they are definitely worth it. I don't regret buying these and have recommended them to other.",5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"If you don't want to break the bank on the name brands like Samsung and Apple earbuds, these earbuds are no slack in quality. The sound is great, and they come with different ear cone sizes to ensure you get a good fit. Packaging is very neatly done and looks professional - something you'd expect from a much larger company selling these earbuds to do.Customer service is great - My left earbud went out unexpectedly and they are sending me a replacement bud with little to no hassle. Their response time for customer support is faster than most large companies too which is outstanding.",5,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"The earbud covers that were already installed but the left one kept falling out.  I tried to change to the next smallest size.

Also, their support website has disappeared.",1,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"I got the rose gold ear buds. It was extremely easy to pair. Just followed the directions. They fit perfectly in my ear. They dont hurt my ear as most earbuds do after a while. I love the color of them, they also came fully charged so I could gi straight to trying them out. I loved that, as when I get something new the first thing I want to do is try them instead if waiting an hour to charge it. The first thing I noticed when I put them in was it blocked out so much sound, once I started playing music it was amazing. The sound is perfect. High quality sound.",5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
Sound quality is amazing and love the charging case. Battery life seems reliable. I work 8 hour shifts and wanted headphones that would last me for at least half the shift. I tried them out and used them for about 4 hours. They still had some battery life but I decided to go ahead and charge them . I didn't pay attention to how long it took to get to full battery but it was full when I put them back on.  Overall this was a great buy for me.,5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"Tried several different types of music, sound is very thin, poor or non-existent bass. Buds are not particularly comfortable. Tried to save a few bucks with these, you get what you pay for. Lots of great reviews, and that’s puzzling, I was willing to be pretty forgiving, but the sound quality is just not acceptable.",2,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
My phone started calling and facetiming people without me even saying anything - the voice control activates itself and then will call random numbers. Terrible!

Wow wow wow wow wow wow these headphones sound so good 🥺 the sound is incredible like the bass is ridiculous !!! I was skeptical because if the price but 🤯🤯 definitely worth it . I'm blown away . The charging case is also very cool ! And the headphones are easy to sync !,5,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
I have little ears and little ear canals. I usually have issues with finding ear pieces that will fit my ears. These fit perfect and don't fall out or hurt. I had one in my ear the entire day with zero discomfort. They come with many different size ear pieces for the perfect fit. The setup was easy. They instantly paired with my phone and pair automatically thereafter with no issues. The sound quality is great. Music sounds good and phone calls are very clear. I have had 3 friends purchase these things in a 48 hour period because I cant stop talking about them. I am very pleased with the overall quality.,5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0

"Very happy with my purchase. I will admit I was skeptical when first purchasing these due to the price, but watched some reviews and decided to give them a shot. Honestly, after using these for a week, I feel like you can't beat these headphones for the price. They are easy to use and was surprised how well they fit in my ear. Have been impressed with the sound quality as well. I would definitely recommend buying these.",5,1,2020-7-12,1,1,0
"The sound is great and the noise cancellation is amazing! It even comes with multiple ear cushions so you can try to see which one fits better in your ear. They look very sleek and cool. ONLY thing is that I bought them for running and HIIT workouts, and as someone who sweats crazy amounts, I was hoping they would stay put without adjusting. They do stay on pretty good for me being me who sweats like crazy. But I do have to adjust it every now and then. That the only thing, if you don't sweat as much and don't have this issue these are amazing and such a dime for your buck!!",5,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0
I have bought these earbuds because my new Samsung S20 G5 does not have a slot to allow a corded earphone that I previously used.  These are great earphones...great fidelity and they hold the charge for more hours than I have used them. (At least 6 hours of listening).  The micophone on the headset also allows clear talking while on the phone.  I recommend these!!!,5,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0

"Experienced signal / sound irregularly dropping when using both earbuds.  If I used just one earbud the sound was consistent and high quality … but then I want to hear both left and right channels when listening to music so what's the point if I can only wear one to listen.  Thought this might have been a defective product so ordered a return/replacement (which Amazon did easily and promptly .. great Amazon service.) However, the second pair exhibited similar signal drop.  Have read where there can be issues with this type of master/slave design .. not confined to just the Tozo … so will try another type of Bluetooth headphones.",2,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"Works well, sounds great. Stay in my ear pretty well, but they do pop out on occasion. I put the smallest tip, and feel like they lock in but give it some time and I either need to push back in or catch them as one drops.  Probably the fault of my small ears.  Case is a great small size, I am happy with purchase so far.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I wear these on the Bart train in SF, and they do NOT block out the train noise. I feel like I need to wear them with the sound pretty loud to actually cancel any noise.

"These are nice.  Thanks.  It has a light feel to it when you listen.  Great for letting go of the over-ear headphones.  It’s all about the midrange with these but lacks a bit of bass.  If you get a loudness, volume or bass boost app, they are much better than without it.",4,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"The mic is very good.  I need these for being on calls and video conferencing.  It took a little getting used to- it's a different feel than old airpods with the snug fit- but I do like it.  And at 1/4 the price  . . .Update:  really uncomfortable for me after a while and I returned.  I tried all the different ear pieces.  Good quality, I just don't like the design of all the weight being on the part that plugs your ear.  Spending the extra money and getting a real set of airpods.",3,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0
"I love these earbuds! They have amazing sound quality, noise cancellation, and I love that the case charges them! The only things I don’t like are the fact that the earbuds fall out sometimes and when I got to put them back in, my finger touches the touch screen on each earbuds and I end up screwing up the song I’m listening to. It will either skip, or start over, etc. you just have to be careful when you’re touching them in your ears. Other than that, they’re great! I would recommend. They’re cheaper than the amazon version and just as good!",5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0

"I took these headphones with me this morning for their first run.  Pairing is simple, and the controls are easy to learn, so you can control your music and the volume without fumbling with devices.  They stand up well to sweat, and did not become displaced or loose during my activity.  Sound quality was great, and I do not need to charge the device any time soon as far as I can tell.All-in-all the switch to these headphones made it much easier to focus on my running.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"I enjoy the sound quality, the comfort, and the touch sensor controls. I haven't tried it while running yet but they feel like they wouldn't fall off like others, while working out.

"I'm loving these wireless, bluetooth earbuds. I previously had been a fan of full-sized headphones and typically travel with my bulky case on the plane. After trying these, I've officially converted to the smaller, sleeker style. The mini case is great, and the audio cancellation quality is amazing. I originally had the rating at 4 stars because I had to troubleshoot with the microphone, but the Tozo service team was quick to respond to my concerns/questions and helped me reset the earbuds. After the reset, the mic works great! This product now gets an easy 5 stars. These are a great value, I love the design and are definitely worth it!",5,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0

Customer service brings the rating from 4 to 5 stars.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
Amazing earbuds for under $100. My wife has the t10 and she loves those and I wanted controls for volume and next track and etc. so i went with these t6. The touch controls are very sensitive but as time goes by I am sure I ll get use to them. Tozo is something else. The sound is really good for this $50 earbuds.... either t6 or t10 you can’t go wrong with.,4,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
I used my Tozo T6 today for the first time at the gym and WOW was I pleasantly surprised by these!  For starters they were ready out of the box to use and were SUPER easy to pair to my phone.  Two seconds and I was ready to go!! I had been hesistant to buy a truly wireless set of ear buds because I was afraid they would fallout during my gym workout.  Not these lovely gems.  Never once did I feel like I was going to lose them out of my ears or even feel them slipping.  The sound quality and noise cancellation was the best I'd come across and I'd tried much more expensive pairs.  For the price you can't beat this product.  I'm beyond happy that I purchased these.,5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"For the price point, these are the most comfortable pair I own. Sound quality is good. As an audiophile, bass is consistent but you wont get to much super low reproduction.

"Still testing battery life, but so far, used for 5 hrs before need to recharge.

I wanted to be able to mow the yard and listen to music. Used them straight out of the box when they came in. It was very humid outside and I started sweating like a horse. Earbuds didn’t move a bit.

If you are looking for knock your socks off bass, go get some over the ear headphones. These do a good job without sacrificing too much quality.I water tested them, no issues there. The different sizes of earbuds were nice. I ended up using the smallest option even though I usually am able to use the medium sizes that come with earbuds. But it is a snug fit without being uncomfortable.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0

"First off, these are my first bluetooth headphones. So I don't have anything to compare them too.But these are really great sounding headphones! I was very surprised with them. The sound quality is good and the bass is good too. I've been using them for a week now and the battery doesn't die out quickly. You leave your phone and walk away from it from a pretty far distance before losing connection. As far as noise cancelling, they do cancel out most of the background noise but obviously if there is a loud bang, you'll be able to hear it.",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
"Just purchased Apple Airpods for wife and Samsung Wireless Earbuds for son at Christmas, so figured I should pick up something for myself. Went with these because of reviews and price. It was a great choice. Extremely happy w sound quality, battery life, functionality, quality, and provided selection of ear tips, etc. They both gave me grief for going with a non-name brand choice. After listening, they both agreed they sounded great (at less than 1/4th of the price).",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"Great ear plugs for sound, music and talking. I only hope they come out with a app like Samsung. Having both ear plugs in will stop you from hearing normal sounds.

If you are looking for a good set of earbuds for listening to music or watching a movie.  These are a great option.  I watched short utube video yesterday & heard music ranges not previously heard.  They do a good job at noise canceling for just being an earbud.,5,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0

With that said, I am impressed by the overall quality. They are superb. Sound quality is great. It paired immediately and easily. The case is compact and feels robust. I chose this over the T10 because this model has a better case and longer battery life. I think it is worth the premium. Thoroughly recommended.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"The sound quality and the easy quick pairing is amazing. I definitely recommend these, I have had a lot of bluetooth buds, headsets etc over the years and these have to be the latest and greatest technology currently available.

"Great earbuds for the money. These have great battery life and are very comfortable.My previous set wouldn't work independently, only 1 earbud connected to the phone so if that one died I was stuck charging. The TOZO T6 earbuds will let you have either earbud set as primary, so if I'm only listening to the right earbud, and it dies, I can use the left earbud while the right is charging in the case. It really helps get you through a long work shift.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
These are pretty good earbuds but there were times where it dropped from my ear and onto the ground. Hopefully I didn’t damage the internal electronics. I do like how it’s touch and not button.

"Pairing was a breeze. I like that either earbud can be used independently (previous earbuds only left earbud could be used). When one earbud is being used, taking the other out of the case automatically pairs them together (my old earbuds didn't do this and would have to be reconnected to my device together). Sound quality is amazing, very loud and clear. I don't know how great the noise cancelling feature is as I haven't used many products that offer noise cancelling.

I also have very small ears but the squishies they come with offer all sizes. They fit snugly in my ears. The microphone is good and sound quality is good. The case holds a great charge.

"They fit well and the sound is good, however it’s frustrating how the lights on the charging case are always on when I close the lid and that drains the battery life.

Battery life exceeds other models I've owned, and Bluetooth pairing with my iPhone8 is quick and seamless.  With a clickable coupon, I picked these up for $40.

"I haven't  had these earbuds long, but so far they are great.  I really like that they charge when placed in the case. I also thought  charging the case via wireless charger was a great feature. I haven't  gotten a wireless charger yet, but plan to in the near future.  The sound quality is pretty good so far. I do wish they could go a bit louder but I personally like my music loud. The noise cancelling is decent when the volume is up. With music at a lower volume you can still hear some background sounds. I like the fact that these earbuds are waterproof too. I can't  wait to wear these this summer doing yardwork! I can't speak to the battery life, as I haven't worn them for an extended period of time yet. Overall, I am happy with my purchace so far.",5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,1
"They came with several sizes of cushions and I was able to quicky adjust to fit my ear. I often have trouble with earbuds, so was pleased to find them so comfortable so quickly. Pairing was a breeze and very intuitive. As others have noted, the bass balance is a little on the high side, but not bothersome and can be addressed via an equalizer app.This is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones, and I'm very pleased. Be sure to look for an available coupon under the product price and note that coupon value can vary depending on the color you select.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"These earbuds are fantastic and a great price with good features. I love the fact that they come 5 sets of ear cup replacements.

Pros :I really like how fast the earbuds connect via bluetooth.,3,1,2020-7-28,1,0,1
They came in a nice box that looked like quality and the wireless earbuds are definitely quality. The assortment of ear cushion sizes made getting the right fit easy. It came with a charred case. I would still recommend giving it a full charge before use. It paired immediately. Great earbuds,5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"So, I've had these for a while now, bout 2 or 3 months. I bought them based on how light they were,  battery life,  and sound quality. I say they are pretty good. If I have one on, I can't hear anything except my music from that side. The real test came unexpectedly when my mom was in the hospital. Sleeping in those chairs are uncomfortable, but atleast I have these headphones. I slept  all night with one in my ear, and woke up to it still going. I have been using them  for about 2 days, only now have i decided to charge them. I can wear them, but I can still hear the nurses call for me. They been a life saver.",5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
I bought these specifically for working out and so far they’ve been great. I like to do HIIT/Metcon type workouts and these earbuds have stayed in my ear just fine. They are small and it’s hard to tell you’re wearing them which is nice. The sound quality and noise cancelling seem to work just fine as well. They automatically pair out of the charging case and you don’t have to worry about turning them on or anything. The charging case is small and sleek and easy to carry around. I’ve been able to recharge the buds after 3-4+ workouts without recharging the case. For the price I’m not sure these buds can be beat.,5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"Amazing sound quality. These blew away my expectations. I recently bought other high rated over ear headphones for the plane though I will return those because these have much, much better sound quality. I have top of the line car audio speakers and these ear buds are on par with that sound. They are also comfortable to wear and they stay in your ear, they havent fallen out yet. Literally one of the best values I have received for my $$.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
They sounded great but no matter how I tried to jam & twist these into my ears they fell out. I switched the rubber fitting things and no help. I looked at so many reviews before I bought these and didn’t see anything about that. I must have alien ears.,3,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"These things sound pretty good, when they want to work. The lights on the case are constantly on, indicating that they're always charging. I'll plug the case in til its fully charged, and it's dead within a few hours of sitting in my pocket. Then, when I put them in my ear, I hear the notification, ""Battery low."" Even though I haven't turned them on or taken them out of the case. I would definitely not recommend these earbuds.",1,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"I've had these wireless earbuds for about 6 months and they sound amazing and are very affordable. They're relatively comfortable and generally only fall out when trying to run. However, I recently bought an Apple Watch to go with my Iphone, and I'm guessing that when another device is paired to my Iphone it messes with the bluetooth connectivity. So, if you just need a well-valued wireless earbud, these are for you, but if you need something that will connect seemlessly with your Iphone and Apple Watch these are not the best option. I'm personally considering taking the leap to Air Pods Pro.",3,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0

"These sound great! The charging case is small and fits comfortably in my pocket and the earbuds themselves come with multiple sized ear thingies, I switched to the smaller ones and they do not budge! The touch controls also feel natural and not having to press an actual button is a nice touch! My only complaint if you even call it one is I wish they got a smidge louder, but I am overall thrilled with these!",5,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
"Just received the ear buds today so I'm still getting used to how to properly set them into my ears, but overall they are a great quality. Nice at noise cancelling and smooth overall appearance.

I've had other wireless earbuds in the past and did not like them because either one side would connect to Bluetooth or the battery life would be done in 2-3 hours.  TOZO earbuds are perfect and this will help motivate me to continue to walk a mile daily.  I had earbuds with wires but when walking the cord would get caught in my arms and fall out.

"I am really impressed by the sound quality of these headphones! They sound very clear and the bass is not overpowering.

"This is my 3rd time purchasing. Twice for me, once for my boyfriend. My sister took my first pair and I lost my boyfriends (these things need a tracker like airpods) 🤣 but there was no question when I needed new ones, which ones I was buying. They are so much louder than airpods and way less noticeable (I got black to hide with my hair) and I really love they come with interchangeable ear pieces because everyone's ears are definitely not the same! Great buy! Worth way more than they are priced so its a bargain! And wireless charger capable!",5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,1

"The audio quality of these headphones is overall very good for their price. They also block out sound really well, which was very important to me while living in a busy city. The only bad thing was that I had a defective pair causing some issues with charging and possibly the touch controls.

I was worried about not having buttons but the touch control has been easy to use. Sound quality is great. Also the battery life is awesome on these! Definitely better than the T10 so far.

"I got these after having the TOZO T10 so needless to say I'm a fan of Tozo, quality products for affordable prices. I like the physical design of the T6 better - the case is way nicer and the earbuds are smaller. I do think the bass on the T10 might be slightly better but not much of a difference. The one thing I like and don't like about these is the sensitivity on the earbuds. It's great when you are trying to pause, skip, etc. but since i often use them for working out i find myself accidentally pausing the songs. Other than that, I am very happy with the product.",5,1,2019-10-18,1,0,1

They do a great job with cancelling noise, the volume & sound quality is great and on part with some of the more expensive brands (Beats by Dre, Bose, Skullcandy). The charging box is very nice since you can charge it without the buds, and then stick the buds in and have them charge without the box plugged in. They are waterproof (you cant just immerse them in water all day). Very nice love them so much I bought my mom some for Mothers day. I'll see how she likes them and possibly write another review.

I've made multiple phone calls and have yet to have a complaint from the person on the other end as I have with other earbuds in the past. Battery life seems to be spot on with claims. I've been using them for two weeks and have yet to have a low battery warning. Just keep them in the case when not in use.

If I have both in, it’s like I’m in my own world and the bass on them is wonderful. It is in the top 10 on Amazons headphones list and I would say accurately so.

I'm sorry Tozo but my first time using and it lost connection with my phone in my hand.

The sounds is wonderful.  I think the thing I like the most is that the case you store/charge them in is so small!  Fits in my pocket so much better than the previous version.They are great earbuds.

"This product delivers what it describes! Noise cancellation is great, the sound quality is crystal clear, you don’t have to turn your volume up too high to hear loudly, and calls can be heard from both ends clearly! Connection stays well even if you're moving away from your phone for some distance. The only thing that annoyed me is that as I’m trying to follow the directions for the touch screen controls, it won’t let me reverse or forwards songs :-( I’m going to try to reset the pairing of the earphones and see if that helps :-/ I’m going to use it for the gym, so it would be nice to skip and repeat songs easier than having to grab my phone all the time. Other than that, great product!",4,1,2019-10-25,1,0,1
"Great battery life and blocks noise. When I put them in, I don't hear people talking to me until I take one out. The sound quality is okay. They fit snuggley in my ears.

"This arrived on time and the packaging is brilliant. Easy to follow user instructions. These fit my ears perfectly and block out ambient sounds. They stay firmly in my ears and don’t fall out, even during vigorous workouts. The sound quality is excellent for the price. Pairing with my iPhone or iPad is easy and fast. The TOZO T6 is an all around great value.",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"This earbuds are so comfortable and the sound is so good. Why would anybody spend $175 on the Apple version? They must have a lot more money than I do. Anyway, even though I put five stars for battery life, I can't speak to that yet since I just got the earbuds and have not used them for more than a couple of hours. I love the pink color of the case, and the unit feels sturdy. Glad I bought them.",5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"At 1st I was a bit skeptical, but now I am very satisfied with these ear buds. They provide good sound and noise cancelation, but the biggest plus is good battery life. I have worn them for 8 hours listening to music and phone calls periodically without the battery going dead.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
I like these! They're pretty much the same as the last one as far as I can tell. Haven't tested the battery life yet but the one before had a decent battery life.My only problem with these so far is minor. I prefer the prior models buttons over the touch sensitive button of these earbuds. Sometimes when I use one ear bud and have the other in my pocket the button is so sensitive that it will pause whatever I'm playing at the slightest tap on the ear buds. Other than that it's pretty good.,5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0

Great company great human relations.And for the earbuds, they are great.  I have tried everything, including AirPods (2 different gens) and the TOZO T6 have been the best.  I’d refer these to anyone.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
I always hate buying new electronic brands but I decided to give these a try. I was gonna go with Skull Candy but I'm glad I didn't! I like that you can listen to just one headphone instead of both. I also like that they're not very visible if your hair covers your ears because we aren't supposed to have headphones at work.,5,1,2020-7-4,1,1,0
"I bought these truly wireless earbuds about a week ago and I’m absolutely hooked on them. I needed a replacement for my BOSE soundsports that were getting a little wore out and I am extremely happy with my purchase. My favorite feature is them being waterproof, I flipped my kayak over yesterday and normally that would mean a new set of earbuds but not now. The only one tiny drawback is the touch controls on the earpieces they are a bit sensitive but they get the job done. Plus, when are you going to not just use your phone for controls anyways? I’m extremely satisfied with this product.",5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
I love the earbuds. They are perfect. They make it really easy to put in the ear and not get in trouble for wearing them because there’s no wire. They also blended in with my hair color cause it not to look different. When ever I’m tired of listening to my family arguing. I can put them in and they cancel out the noise. Making it really easy to fall asleep with no disturbances or distractions.,5,1,2020-9-2,1,1,0
I was extremely skeptical at first as I am a a huge stickler for audio quality and still firmly believe that wired headphones are always going to have superior sound. That being said for the price of $50 I figured I'd give them a try. I am absolutely surprised with how nice these sound. The range of the bluetooth conectivity is also fantastic (I can leave my phone on the opposite side of my apartment and these work fine). I have tested the waterprood claims and am happy to say they are! They fit snug in my ears and leave no discomfort nor do they fall out while I'm at the gym. Fantastic purchase for the price highly recommend!,5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"For the price they are amazing. They fit perfectly in my ear and don't fall out. Connected to my PC running Windows 10 and there is no lag. I prefer this model (T6) versus the T10, which did give me lag. No need to spend hundreds on AirPods, these sound very good.",5,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"I like the design of the product. Easy to charge. The downside is when you are talking to someone, they can hear any noise, so it's very sensitive. I'm not sure if it's just my pair that's like this but it's an issue with whomever I am speaking to on the phone. They can hear anything I am doing, and it distorts the sound",3,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0

I like the wireless charging capability and design.

"The right earbud volume would not adjust. It was extremely low.  The left earbud would become slightly louder, but it was still difficult to hear. After many troubleshooting approaches they still would not work. I'm sending them back now and hopefully the reordered pair will work as they should! Fingers crossed. I'll update when the second pair arrives. Hopefully I can change my review.",1,1,2020-3-24,1,1,0
"I love them. They cancel out all noise, easy for when I’m working out I don’t get distracted with other noises around me. Easy to work, I was able to pull them out and use them right away. They were 90% charged when they arrived so I have yet to charge them. My nephew got a hold of them and put them in water they still work really good! Very excited that they’re waterproof, it was a big plus for me. Don’t have to worry about sweating and messing my headphones up.Price was also a plus as I didn’t want to buy something expensive just to use for the gym or work. So if they get lost or stolen I don’t have to worry about losing out on a ton of money.  So very excited having them!!",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
I bought these for Christmas and now the left side won't charge. I've had these for a little over a month and they break.

"I bought the TOZO T6 to replace the around the neck style LG Bluetooth headphones I was using. I didn’t realize what an upgrade the T6 was going to be. The main draw for me to the T6 was the wireless changing case. I have two vertical charging stands already and was hoping the wireless charging case would work with the vertical stand. The charging case works great with my vertical wireless chargers. These earbuds have everything I was looking for; small charging case, wireless charging, touch controls, automatic paring and quality good sound. I highly recommend these earbuds. I will be buying another pair for my wife to upgrade her current Bluetooth headphone.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,1
"Sound quality is pretty good, but volume is so low that you have to take a volume booster to it in a noisy environment. One thing I absolutely hated about the T10's that the T6's improved on is that cutting out was an annoying fade in effect that made listening to music or YouTube videos through them an absolute pain. One thing the T6's doesn't improve on, however, is battery life. the T10's gave me 4 hours if I was lucky, and often times the T6's will die in the same amount of time.I guess I'd give these a 2.5 star rating if I could, but yeah. Gotta try a little harder than that, Tozo.",2,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0

"At first I was a little hesitant about purchasing this product since it wasn’t the usual “brand AirPods” but upon reading the many positive reviews, I decided to purchase these for my bf. My bf is super picky and he actually loved these! He’s used them at the gym and said the quality is great and do not fall out while running which was one of my concerns. Battery life is great and the charging box is quickly charged to full battery. I definitely recommend these if you want something cheaper but with great quality.",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0

I was pleasantly surprised of how well these performed. I use them primarily for the gym.

You get a sense that you’re going to be purchasing an awesome product, a week into owning the product I was greatly disappointed with its lack of connectivity with Bluetooth. Ultimately one of the headphones completely stopped syncing with the charge Housing, it would never work again. The little red light would just flicker nonstop and never come out of that malfunction.

I didn't even have to change the rubber ear pieces to any of the FIVE sizes provided, they fit perfectly right out of the box. I listened to music ranging from +44 to old Tupac. These earbuds sounded awesome for everything. Even the insane bass in The XX ""Islands"" sounded good without losing the lyrics. Super happy for the price and quality! I also included pictures of the extra earpieces, as well as a size comparison to the Airpods, since nobody really showed a good one.",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,1

Really great value. I wish the touch feature wasn’t so sensitive so that when I would adjust them in my ears the music stops or skips. There are 5 different ear tips which is great.

Then the wearer speaks, it comes across over the background noise, but when not speaking, the background noise is loud. They also seal in your ear, so if you don’t like listening to yourself with your ears plugged, you might not like these.They are very comfortable, easy to use, and the fact that there is no post to get caught on things means they stay put.",4,1,2020-10-4,1,0,0

Poor fit, and it says its waterproof, but while using in the shower it will slide out of your ears, and if it doesn't the touch sensors will get activated and change your songs randomly.

Definitely save your money and spend a little more for better quality.",1,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"The sound is great, love the fit. They stay in when working out. Love the touch features so I don’t have to always pull my phone out. Oddly though, ordered black and pink set, pink set sounded hollow and would keep cutting out. Ordered a second black set and are as great as the first black set.",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
I dropped my charging case and contacted customer service to see if I could just purchase the case.  The headphones still worked. Jaime at customer service got back with me and told me they’d send out one free of charge!! Say what?? Awesome customer service! This is the second pair I’ve bought and will definitely buy again! I recommended them before this and will definitely continue to support this company!,5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
This is by far the best pair or wireless headphones I’ve ever bought.  Not only did they come fully charged but they came with six(6) different size earbuds.  All my previous ones only came with 2 or maybe 3.  Definitely recommend and would buy again.,5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
The buds came in an amazing packaging. I have been trying to find buds that have a case so I can add to my keys cause my other buds kept getting lost! These fit perfect in the case and I love the options is ear cushions so far these are my fav!,5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,1
They have long enough battery life and sound fine however they fall out of my ears anytime I move to much. I could only use them while staying in place which kind of defeats the purpose of them being wireless. I ended up returning them.,2,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"I have owned a number of ear buds, many of which have not lasted more than a year due to usage. I like the fact this brand comes with the option for an extended 18 month warranty. For the price, the sound is very good. What I like most about these buds is how easy they are to use. The MFB touch panel provides many features such as FF, RW, and volume controls by simply touching either the left or right bud. The buds also come with 10 additional ear fittings and the charging case supports wireless charging.  I have not owned them long enough to rate the battery and charging life, but overall these appear to be great True wireless ear buds for the price.",5,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
"These headphones fit quite snugly and seemed lightweight enough to be comfortable for a long time; however, I chose to return them as soon as I tested them with a few songs. The sound was extremely tinny and seemingly wasn't hitting any bass. It was also very fuzzy, with static that grew more pronounced as I turned the volume up. I really wanted to like these, but it seems like I'll have to keep looking.",2,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"Been eyeing these earbuds for quite a while because I have a sibling who has owned the T8s. I liked having something a bit more compact so it's easier to bring in a purse. The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is great. The ability to just tap on either side of the earbud to pause the audio is extremely convenient. It's very easy to connect and I have never had problems connecting the earbuds onto my iPhone X. As soon as I take the earbuds out of the case, it automatically connects to my iPhone and that's what I really enjoy. I would highly recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to deal with any more wired earbuds. I put it off for such a long time but I'm definitely satisfied with my purchase!",5,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
Got here the next day. Sounds great. Quick charge. Easy to connect. I debated between AirPods and pixel buds but decided I didn’t want to spend that amount of money on headphones. So a quick amazon search and I found these bad boys. Gets the job done.,5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,1

Amazing wireless ear buds. Connection/Pairing could not be easier-after initial set up-they pair automatically once taken from the convenient charge box. Sound quality is extremely good for the price and louder and clearer than anticipated. You will NOT want to play these at maximum volume. Great value for the money!!,5,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"I've gone through so many earbuds under $50 with no success until these. Great battery life, fit, excellent sound and noise cancellation (I can barely hear my kids shouting) for the price. I wear these more than my Bose QuietComfort's and Sony WH-1000's.The kicker is I misplaced one. I thought I had left on kitchen counter, turns out it fell into the dishwasher. It must have gone through 10 cycles before I noticed it. Figured that's kaputt so was ready to buy another pair. Oh hell I'll charge just for fun, put them on, OMG it works perfectly. Blew my mind. I still bought more..",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"The Tozo T6 earbuds are the best earbuds I've had the pleasure of using. To start, they're one of the few that don't fall out of my ear after a few minutes, and that counts for a lot.The sound quality is incredible considering the size factor, it's almost as good as my $70 headphones while being a fraction of the size. The battery life isn't as bad as you might think, I get a few hours of use with intermittent listening (I use these at work in between helping customers).",5,1,2019-9-24,1,0,0
"An upgrade from the very popular t10 from tozo, these are rich controlled now and have the same almost perfect performance, these are my daily drivers for listening to anything via bt, very reliable and worth more than its low price, better than more expensive offerings and well worth it, biggest bang for your buck when it comes to true wireless earbuds. highly recommended",5,1,2019-10-18,1,0,0
These earbuds sound great especially for the price point. People tell me my voice is clear on calls. I had an issue of one of the waterproofing coatings pulled off while I was changing the tips and so I emailed Tozo support directly. They were extremely helpful and are giving me a replacement ear bud. Cool earbuds and really nice customer service.,4,1,2020-4-30,1,1,0
I’ve only had it for a day but so far it’s great. It doesn’t hurt my ears like headphones normally do. I’ve been listening to music. The distance I can walk away from my phone is good I bought these so I can do conference calls at home easier while my kids are around.,5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"Was skeptical about using these on a business call, but after the first call, I was sold.  Great noise blocking and also great voice acoustics.  Outside of business calls, my music sounds really good.  Glad I made the purchase!",5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0
Just received these earbuds and rested them out. They seem really great and I'm so excited to have them! Easy to pair and use. Clear phone calls and listening to music with them. Have done lots of research on other earbuds and the T6 have the best reviews of similar earbuds out there. Great price and quality for a pair of earbuds!,5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"Very good sound quality, fit tight in the ear reducing exterior noise.  Battery lasted at least 6 hours straight listening to music.  Not sure how long they would have lasted.Only negative is charging on my samsung pad it just shows blinking lights they never showed that they were done charging even overnight. When connected to supplied cord it charged quickly and lights lock",5,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
I opened my Tozo earbuds and within 5 minutes they were paired and synced to my phone. The process was effortless. I am impressed with the sound as well as with the range. I can leave my phone in one place and am able to go to other rooms in the house with no disruption to my music. I primarily bought these to use at the gym. Using them makes my gym experience much more enjoyable.,5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,1
I love these earbuds. I have never had a company give me so many different adapters that I found a perfect fit.My personal use information is I use one earbud at a time and switch when it dies the case recharges the earbuds more then 2 times.,5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"The sound quality and battery life is good but they continue to have issues. One issue is that the sound cuts out occasionally. If I tap on it it will sometimes come back. Also, they lose connection daily. I'll be listening and all of the sudden it says disconnected.Update after a couple months. The touch pad on one of the earbuds is not working. It doesn't respond when I touch it and continues to power on and off.",1,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
They’re really nice. My boyfriend had the T10 model and I really enjoyed his so i decided to buy the newer version and they’re just as nice as his. I like the case it’s really small and cute. I also like that it came with 1 year warranty and with extra buds for the earphones.,5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
So it's September. I purchased these in January this year and the battery is already not holding a charge. Everything else was great About them. I can't enjoy them anymore however.,3,1,2020-9-26,1,1,0
Only issue i had is on my Samsung galaxy note 5 in the game mode im getting static sounds. Come to find out its caused by the game company. Super cell. Clash of clans so i loaded a different game company and the sound was great the static stopped.So the issue i was having with the static is not the falt of the t6 ear buds but with the game itself.,5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"The sound is amazing! When listening to music the bass is amazing, considering the size of the earbuds. Calls are clear, no dropouts. Party on the other end never complained about wind nor complained about hearing me. Now the cons which aren't too bad. I wished the case could be textured, very slippery when removing earbuds. Wish it could be a slight delay on the time you touch the earbuds and the reaction time.. Example.. when placing buds in your ear it reacts immediately. Also would be nice to have textured or ribbed material on buds are slippery also. Your money will not be wasted on getting these for the price.",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,1
"These earbuds are great. The sound is amazing the fit is good and I have historically had trouble finding earbuds that fit.  The price is excellent. I had to reach out to customer service to help reset the buds and the customer service was very responsive. Great product, great price, fantastic customer service puts Tozo at the top of my list for recommendation!",5,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0

"Purchased 2 months ago.  Left earbud went out yesterday.  It is only at half volume.  This is unfortunate because I like the fit and feel.  Noise canceling is only passive, and listeners on a call can hear a lot of background noise.5/5/20 - CR reached out with some options for replacement.  Great customer service!  I’m hoping it was just a fluke.  But I am happy with their response. I have updated my initial review from 2 to 3 stars.",3,1,2020-4-2,1,0,0
"Pair easily, hold a charge well, sound quality is sufficient (I’m not an audiophile to be able to analyze it). My only complaint is the touch factor controls are difficult to learn - but that could be my own laziness. I prefer buttons. I would not hesitate to get another pair.",4,1,2020-3-21,1,0,0
"These earbuds are great for the price. They have an amazing battery life (I have used them for hours at a time and the lowest I've gotten so far is 70%). Some people complain that water droplets trigger the sensors while in the shower, but that doesn't seem to be a problem for me. It probably depends on what kind of showerhead you use and the angle the water comes down from, so do consider that. Overall, I am very satisfied and would easily buy these again.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
These are great budget earbuds. I have enjoyed using them and they have stayed in my ears through weight lifting and running without moving around at all. The battery has never died while using them.  I love that you can use one earbud at a time. Most importantly you can control music with the earbuds!,5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"These have great sound quality compared to other blue tooth ear buds I've tried.  They are also much smaller in size than others. But they don't always stay in my ear. For example, when out gardening they'd fall out of my ear many times.  They come with many size ear attachments and I've tried several but they still don't feel snug.Battery life is OK - not quite as good as others but not bad.",4,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"A bit difficult to remove from cHarging case, but buds appear to work decent. Also noticed the batt life isn’t as good as expected. Overall they are easy to use and good for the cost.",4,1,2020-3-29,1,1,0
"Love how it looks. Super cute. It was a bit more bulky than expected, but I can hide it well with my hair during work. The sound is great. It does get annoying when I adjust them and they pause or skip a song, but it doesn’t bother me too much. It does start to hurt my ears a bit after 6-7 hrs of working, but it’s not of any pain I can’t endure. Definitely better than wearing plain old earplugs that hurt my ears without music. Lol. I started working at 2, and it died around 9. Highly doubt it was fully charged, so we will see if it lasts the whole day at work tomorrow. Overall, it’s definitely great. And I love it atm.",4,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0
"I had the TOZO T10 earbuds and really enjoyed them the only complaint I had with them was the charging box was too bulky for my pocket.  Bought these and love the more slender charging box and can easily slide into my pocket.  Sound quality is great, my wife has to yell at me to get my attention while wearing them.  And also noticed that the T6 is slightly smaller than T10 which is also nice.  Ran half marathon with them a couple of weekends ago and didn't need to adjust them at all.  Great wireless earbuds",5,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
"After a bit of research, I chose the Tozo T6 wireless earbuds over the many choices available on Amazon. For the price point I wanted to pay, they are fantastic. I’m a moderate listener to several kinds of music and have tried many kinds of earbuds with a price point below $ 50.00 . For my personal use the T6 buds are the best!",5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"pros.  Sound quality is great.  Cons,The touch features are hard to figure out.  There is directions but it isn’t as simple as listed.  I’m not able to wear the earbuds because it hurts my ears really bad.  I tried all the different sizes in the box but they all hurt my ear canal.  I gave them to my wife and she liked them.  They didn’t hurt her ears at all so it’s probably my ears that are the problem.  I never had a problem with I-phone earbuds so i ordered a knock off of that for myself.",3,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"Sound quality is clear, but not crisp or much bass. Cancels most noise and is good in that part and the battery life. The touch panels are great and aren’t too touchy like most. They don’t fit my ears that great but will stay in without issues. I like them but I wouldn’t buy them for myself again. Worth the money spent overall",4,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
I read a ton of reviews and asked some co-workers and these came highly recommended. The price point was great and so far they sound great. They paired right away with my iPhone 11. Love the Rose Gold color.I'll update my review after I get a chance to break them in.,5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
Better than Samsung earbuds imo. These hands down are the best earbuds I have ever owned. They are comfy durable sleeck and the battery lasts what feels like a lifetime!! If you don't own these.... Get them now!!!,5,1,2020-6-16,1,1,0
"I had a friend tell me to try out these as an alternative to AirPods. She said they will come out of the case and immediately connect. They did! I also appreciate the 5 different options of sizes for my ears. I am so glad I purchased these, and I will be using them daily.",5,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0
"Overall, these are a great product. The sound is great, the design is great, and they are cheap compared to name brands. They pair very well with my Google phone. I can even active the Google assistant with them. These don't have noise cancellation tech but they do a good job of cutting outside sounds while inserted. I tried them in the shower and the music kept cutting out as the water disrupts the signal. They still work after getting wet. They have never fallen out of my ears.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0
"I really like how these earbuds connect easily to my devices. The sound quality is good! The waterproof is great but I wore them once when I was washing my face and got worried because the volume kept going up. They are good to use when it's raining too if you want to use when out in the rain. I enjoy these especially when I'm exercising. I can easily pause my music, adjust the volume and change the song without taking out my device.",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"When I first purchased these in October, I loved them. The sound quality is good to listen to music, however, you cannot use them to take phone calls. There is no noise canceling/wind resistance so no one on the other end can hear you very well. I got over that and was OK using them for just music. Then, after less than 3 months of use, they have stopped working. The volume will completely drop out, going from say a 7 to a 1, then sometimes back up (sometimes not). They will completely drop and disconnect from my bluetooth devices and refuse to stay connected. I've tried resetting and disconnecting, reconnecting, etc. - all to no avail. Very disappointed in this product.",1,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"These earbuds were great while the worked, but before long they lost their pairing ability and would immediately disconnect.

Bought these to use at work. For the price you won't find better buds. Sound is amazing and the touch operation is quite useful. They stayed charged for a long time as does the case. These are amazing I'm tempted to buy another pair in case I lose or break them. 10/10,5,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
"Love these headphones. The sound is great. The charge keeps for days. They’re water proof. I never got the apple AirPods because until recently they were shaped the same way as their regular ear buds that have come with their phones for years and I don’t like the way those fit in my ears. I can only tolerate soft buds in my ears. These feel great, sound great, and are much more reasonably priced.",5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
Love these.  I use them to for walking and love that they sound out all the noise around. Very crisp and clear sound and does pair up really fast and easy. Effortless actually. The fact that their colors included pink is a major plus. Great buy!,5,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
"I just purchased these ear buds after reading the reviews and I am thoroughly impressed. The ease of use and sound quality is amazing. I do not have any problems. It fits nicely in my ears.

"I really like these and the price was good as well.  I wish that the smallest earbud was a little smaller because sometimes they come a bit lose but that is really the only complaint that I can think of.

"I really wanted to like the earbuds. They have very good sound quality and cool design. It has great connections and stays connected to Bluetooth.  My only issue and biggest problem is that these earbuds do not stay in my ear. I've tried all the different rubber pieces but earbuds do not stay in😔. These are good for minimal movement, not ideal for working out, running/jogging or bike riding😣. I will be returning mines and continue to search for good wireless earbuds 😒.",3,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
"Great little earbuds. They paired easily and have simple controls. The base is weak if you're used to Bose or other good earphones but these are awesome for a run on the beach, gardening or listening to podcasts.

"Bought a black pair for my husband and a white pair for myself. The black pair box was larger and we didn't understand why until opening. Only the black pair comes with additional sized earbuds you can put on the earbud. The white ones did not. Also, they do not pair to windows 10, maybe i will try to see if the black pair do. Considering the fact that they are the same price and advertised to be the same, I feel a bit bamboozled lol. Haven't used these long enough to rate the quality, so far so good. Bass is lacking but for the price they sound great. Also, tech support is only available for the black pair, not the white pair.",3,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
Had a discount coupon when I purchased it (even better price).  Like the wireless charging.  Small case to keep in pocket.I use it when working around the yard and mowing.

Very frustrated with this purchase for several reasons.1) I've purchased similar headphones for cheaper that had  a far superior battery life! These legit drain and die within a couple of hours. It's like they drain while being in rhe charging case.,1,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0
"These work really well, voice quality on phone calls / facetime is good too.As with all earbuds, if you're not getting bass, move up on the ear cup sizes.  Fortunately this device has something like three or four sizes with it so they started sounding great right away.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"Really great product! A little bulk for me, and the touch is really sensitive. Also the noise cancellation is very effective to the point where I can hardly hear anything if they are in. Would be better if they were smaller and fit better in my ears. I tried all the sizes and ways of putting them in but they are either going to fall out or completely block out all noise. Overall, really happy with sound quality and battery life though!",4,1,2020-2-2,1,1,0
"These are solid like everything else Tozo puts out. But these are my least favorite. Great for calls. Not great for music. Just hollow and pretty quiet at max volume. If you want Tozo for music, I would definitely go with T12. Great sound. If you blast music, download an app that is just called Equalizer. Its the only app like that I've ever seen work. But overall these are best. Biggest driver between all 3 of their models. Best bass and best battery life. It even has the best case. 4 stars out of respect for this company.",4,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"These are an affordable option for earbuds and they are super comfortable. For the first three months they worked really well.

"The Tozo T6 is amazing. As far as ease of use, quality of sound, battery life, and durability. And the price!! I’ve used AirPods before and for one, they’re super ugly and cheap looking, not to mention expensive. These are a fraction of the price of AirPods but work so well. Also, AirPods  are not waterproof like these ear buds. I went swimming in a pool with them on and they worked great. I also love the fact that has several different silicone ear pieces to fit all different ear sizes (6-7). Which now thinking back, I never knew there that many different sizes lol so long story short, buy this!! You won’t regret it.",5,1,2020-6-4,1,0,0
"Great battery life, I get close to 6.5 hours when constantly listening to podcasts. The case easily charges them 3Xs with a small 4th charge. Sound is far better than what I expected. Microphone seems good, I have not heard the other end but everynone I've called said it sounded good and didn't pick up too much back round noise (wind being an exception .. over ~10mph and they can't hear me). Comes with 7 different ear tips for a custom fit. Touch control can be a little sensitive. After 2 weeks I had a issue where the right earbud got noticably quieter. Switched ears and it was still quiet.",4,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0
Good earbuds for the price. Haven't tried the battery life yet. Sound is good but have to see how long it lasts. The opening for the charge port is poorly designed probbaly breaks after a few times. I will update my review in a few weeks/months if anything changes.,4,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"These earbuds are amazing in comparison on other products I have tried for the price point. My son has apple first generation ear buds, and these are just as good in terms of sound quality and battery life (for less than a third of the price). They are definitely more comfortable in terms of fit. The pairing process is easy, and I have never experienced an issue when trying to connect to a Bluetooth source. My wife borrowed these for her daily walk, and now she is asking for a pair of her own. Definitely a product worth investing in!",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
"First off, I was worried about getting these headphones. I usually have difficulties with ones that stick into your ear. They usually do not fit or keep falling out but these come with some many sizes that you cannot go wrong. Also, once you insert and with a small twist they don't fall out. Beyond that, they are extremely slick and the sound is similar to a bose headphone/system. I love the quality and at such a great price range. If you are thinking about buying these STOP THINKING and JUST BUY THEM! You cannot go wrong. The charger is also slim and sexy and the magnetic catch works really well. My only major complaint is that I didn't buy them earlier.",5,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0

Most kids would be just as happy to receive these as they would the original Apple product.  This is a perfect alternative for a young person who has been asking for AirPods but you as an adult do not want to risk paying over $100 for something that may get lost or stolen.  As long as your child isn’t married to the idea of only receiving AirPods for a gift and don’t care that these are black, not white like AirPods then you can’t go wrong purchasing these.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
Well I just received my earphones today it was not difficult to pair them. When I put them in my ears they where very comfortable. Did not feel like they where going to fall out.The sound quality was amazing i did not hear anything else around me. The sound quality is so amazing that I'm mad at myself for not buying them sooner. Especially since I have been looking at them for a while.,5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,1
"I've been using these buds for working out and running primarily. I really like the charging case and the sound quality. They fit well in my ears, but make sure when you unbox them that you try the different bud sizes so you can pick the ones that fit your ears. The Bluetooth connectivity is really good too, I've had problems with Bluetooth headphones in the past but these never disconnect. The only problem I've had with them I'd the touchscreen interface. It's very sensitive and sometimes gets activated by my hair or headwear. Now that I've gotten used to them, it doesnt happen nearly as often. All in all, the best wireless buds I've ever had.",5,1,2019-11-29,1,0,0

"This is a great wireless earbuds at a reasonable price point. I use it for day to day activities, listening to music, taking calls on my phone or taking Skype calls on my PC and sometimes for workout. They mostly stay snug and don't fall off. I have tried few other buds at this price point and I can say this one is better than most others. There are couple of issues though. 1. Battery life could have been better.. mine run out of juice after 4 hrs or so 2. Touch controls are double edge sword.. I have ended up answering calls while trying to decline them.",4,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
These truely wirelessly earbuds are great! They sound really good considering the price. Sound quality is clear in a phone call and callers were able to here me just fine. The only downside to these headphones are that they are not the most comfortable around but that could be due to my strange earholes.,5,1,2019-9-19,1,0,0
"Love these guys! Their noise canceling is almost TOO good. I love that you can use either one, one at a time.  Once connected all you have to do is remove them from the case and it pairs automatically and when you are done just put them away and they will turn off and charge. I had a older pair that connected through the right bud only and had to return those.This are great! I use them at work and wear just one bud!",5,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"I just got these earbuds and I love them. They fit perfectly. They come with some juice so you can use them as soon as you get them. Sound quality is amazing and the material feels very expensive and durable. The earbuds are very easy to use. The touch controls can play and pause a song, adjust volume, and go forward and backwards. It fits right in my pocket and pairs as soon as I take the earbuds out. I would definitely recommend buying these.",5,1,2020-7-2,1,0,1
I really wanted to like these buds.  I just couldn’t get them to fit right and I tried most of the silicon cushions.  If I jammed them in as far as I could to where it was uncomfortable the bass response was good otherwise it’s all high end and no bass.  This is a well designed set of buds if they fit your ears you will probably like them.  As for me I have to send them back.,3,1,2020-4-25,1,0,0

"I really like these ear buds!  I have 2 pair, and the fit is excellent.  I had a connection issue, initially, but I followed the easy instructions, reset them, and they were flawless.They work up to about 30 feet from your device.

"I’ve only had these earphones for two months, but I thoroughly enjoy and recommend them for anyone looking to purchase noise cancellation earphones.My only issue I have had after using them as frequently as I do is my charging dock suddenly stopped working.

I value the commitment and excellence they provided to ensure I can still enjoy this product.",5,1,2020-10-5,1,0,0
"These headphones sound great! At the price point, the sound is better than I expected with a pretty full range. The battery life is strong too, I use these for the majority of the day and pause on and off while interacting with coworkers and they remain on all day and don't need recharging. The total listening time is probably around 3 or 4 hours but they remain on standby with no issues, and still several charges left in the case. These are a good deal!",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
These are excellent  headphones👌 No exaggeration these are WAY better than my Beats headphones in every way especially sound which is the whole point and less than half the price.

Expecting good results.,5,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
Worked great for three days but then the right earbud stopped working.  No lights would come on. It wold not charge.  Had to return.  I am considering buying another set as I really did like them for when I exercise.  I find most earbuds easily fall out but these held.,4,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
Love it. The battery lasts extremely long time and with a charging case its impossible to run out of battery. I had the soundpeats true engine wireless earphones before but the wiring disconnected in one earbud. I got tired of this problem continuously occurring and their warranty only lasts 12 months which is when the wiring starts to break down. I use them all day everyday and sometimes fall asleep with them so the switch to something wireless was necessary. The battery is great and I don't have to worry about what I will do without earphones.,5,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
I wasn’t sure at first about going with an this brand but I’ve been thoroughly happy with my purchase. The price point is excellent for what you get. I thought it would be an issue without noise canceling but having the silicone ear bud eliminates enough noise to my liking. They are comfortable to wear for a couple hours... especially if I’m on a bike ride. Some people complained about the lack of bass but depending on what genre if music I’m listening to...I don’t have any issue! I’d recommend these earbuds!,5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,1

"Previously I owned Jabra Bluetooth headphones that were twice the price of these Tozo. I was skeptical of what the quality would be, but they're such a bargain, I had to give them a shot. To my surprise, they are smaller, sound better, and have a longer battery life at less than half the price.Even better, they have awesome customer service. I reached out to see if I could buy a replacement charging case (it fell out of my pocket). Since they didn't have one available for purchase, they are sending me a whole new pair of headphones free of charge.",5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0

Got them in the mail 5 days before it was supposed to arrive. They paired instantly with a full charge they look awesome the sound quality is on point and the earbuds that came on it for my ears perfectly I shake my head hard enough to give me a headache and they won't fall off. Awesome earbuds for a great price recommend them to anyone and everyone good job Tozo no 5 stars because they are a little to big and don't look very sleek in my ears and they haven't been used very long after 6 months if they still work like they should I'll update it and give 5 stars.,5,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0

I think I'll be able to find a better fit for me, so I've sent these in for a return.",2,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"Absolutely amazing. I have bought numerous Bluetooth headphones and have been displeased with them, including galaxy buds and airpods. No matter what I did with any of them, they were either too quiet or immediately fell out of my ear. I gave up hope in finding a perfect headphone until I came across these. They’re perfect, light weight, East fit with numerous interchangeable options for the ear bud and the sound is immaculate. I’m going to be order a few more sets as gifts for my kids and friends, and I highly recommend them. Couldn’t ask for a better, higher quality headphones at such a affordable price.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0

"Coming from a musician who likes to exercise... I honestly love these sooooo much more than Apple AirPods... they actually stay in your ears, and come with multiple sizes of the rubber inner ear piece to fit your ear size perfectly.

Seriously can’t express enough how AMAZING these earbuds are. And at only $50?? Incredible.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
I’ve had these since January.  The shipping was fast and they came well packaged.  I generally do not write reviews but I thought I’d wait a while and see how they preform before writing one.  THEY ARE AMAZING!! I’ve had them for 5 months now and I use them every day and the quality has not reduced.  One of the best things about them is noise cancellation.  Out of every pair of headphones and earbuds I’ve ever owned these as the best!! (They are even better than Sony and Beats headphones) just everything about them is good quality!! I highly recommend them and they are totally worth it!!,5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
"I've had these Earbuds several months in order to assess my satisfaction with them after extended use and I remain very happy with my purchase.  They are easy to use, though I had to play around with the touch controls since I didn't read the manual, but not having to access my phone to control them is a plus.  They sound great and are comparable to my wife's A-buds at a much lower price.  I also like that they are not as obtrusive when I am wearing them.  I would definitely buy them again.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0

And even if you start running low, it only takes like an hour in the charging case to recharge them.  Not to mention you can get several charges off the case before it needs charging itself.  Overall this is a very good quality product, and the price can't be beat for what you get.  Everything is nice and small so it easily fit in your pocket.  The range is pretty good too.

I needed true wireless earbuds for various activities. I had tried another brand and was let down. That when I decided to Give the Tozo T6's a try. I am sure glad I did. Build quality is great and they fit perfect in my ears I have used them at the gym and to play basketball with no issue at all. My only small knock is I wish they had the capability to be a little louder at times. But are plenty loud and cancel noise well for what I use them for. A+,5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0

"Love these headphones for work. The volume is lower than i would have liked but the sound quality is good for the price. The waterproof usability is not there. The problem is that these are touch sensitive and when wet they start bugging out. The water triggers the buttons randomly rendering them useless when wet, but they will survive getting wet so thats good enough for me.",4,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"For the most part, the buds have been great, however I do have a few small minor issues with them. I can only use the right one because the left one, without being touched, will turn the volume all the way down and when I try to use the right one or the device to turn the volume back up, the left one does the same thing again. So I just don’t use it and that kinda sucks. Second, they don’t stay in my ear! Switching the tips didn’t help either, but the battery life is excellent! I use mine for days for at least an hour a day without charging them! So kudos for that!",4,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0

Great sound quality. I needed some headphones so I can use around the house for calls and music while I clean and do house chores. These have been great so far! Really nice pink color is a plus. Battery has been amazing as well. Since I received them I haven't had to plug them in to charge and that's been about 3 days almost! Also a lot of reviews said the touch panel was too sensitive and I was debating on not to get them because of this. But I'm glad I did because they're not sensitive they're just right.

The sound quality is nice. I wouldn’t really call this noise canceling because I can still hear what’s going on outside of them, but they get pretty loud and muffle/distract from other noises well enough. The biggest drawback are the touch controls. You have to touch them just the right way to get them to work, so they can’t take some time to get used to.

"Battery life is poor — you might get 3 hours. There is also sometimes a lag in connecting and at times you cannot reconnect unless you turn off, then turn on bluetooth again. Sometimes that does t even work. When you put ear plugs on, depending on how you grab the piece, it will forward or turn on voice command—-they are sensitive to the touch.",2,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
Great set of earbuds. These things have great sound and excellent noise canceling. I have run them all day and the battery is still not dead. I have owned about 7 pairs of wireless earbuds and these are as good as my JBLs.,5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
These earbuds were awesome until the right one stopped working. When I let the seller know they offered to replace them right away.  I can't wait to get the new ones.  They are so comfortable to wear on my 7 mile walks and the sound is great!,5,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0
"I've had this product for a few days and I'm loving them so far! It comes with 6 different sized pairs of earbuds, so you'll be able to fit it to your ears perfectly. Sounds great, and picks up my voice clearly when I am on the phone.",5,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0
Got these headphones in and in less than a minute had them paired to my phone.  I had a different brand previously and couldn't get the left and right ear to stay paired but these paired to each other no issues and stayed paired the entire time I was using them.  Sound quality was great both connected to my phone and my laptop.  Listened to an hour long conference call and everything came thru clear.  I also walked to the other side of the house and didn't drop the connection.  Love the case and the fact that it has lights that indicate how much charge is left.  Case also fits nicely in the pocket for easy transport.,5,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
These headphones were just given to me as a gift and they have not disappointed in the few days I have had them. The noise cancellation is great and then the sound is wonderful. Takes a little getting use to the touch controls but once you have that figured out you are good to go. Would definitely recommend at this point.,5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"Just barely got these wireless earbuds in the mail today and I put them to the test to see what I think of them. So far so good, i have the volume to its highest and I feel like it could still be louder. I bought these for when I go running so we’ll see how well they hold up. I like the fact that they’re wireless and that you can charge them in their case like the AirPods. I have an iPhone and I refuse to spend over $100 on AirPods. So glad that I found these for less than half the price!",4,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"I have been interested in possibly getting some wireless earbuds for awhile, but didn't want to pay a lot of money for a pair that I might end up losing or not liking. I found these though and am so happy I did!! They were more affordable for me and they work great so far, even better than I expected! They come with multiple different caps so you can find the best fit for your ear and they're super easy to use after the first couple wears and you get use to how the controls work. Would definitely recommend these wireless earbuds as an alternative to pricey other options!",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
Just got them. They paired to my phone no problem and the sound quality is awesome. They come with several earbud options so you can find the right fit for your ears.

"These Earbuds are the best sets I have found in a long time! I have tried many before and thankfully this is the first time that the noise-canceling portion of the buds actually work.

Main two things I liked about this product were the multiple different ear pieces. There are even earpieces that might not hold in your ears during vigorous activity but are a lot more comfortable if you were just sitting still and listening. This set of headphones really surprised me with the level and Clarity of the sound as well as very strong powerful volume.,5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,1
"I recently purchased the Tozo T6 IPX8 Earbuds. All features of these competitively priced Bluetooth earbuds present a high end product — from the packaging, to the design of the earbuds and charging case, to a free one year extended warranty. The sound quality of the earbuds and ease of use for telephone calls, movies and music are top quality. They fit easily and comfortably in the ears. The charging case is extremely well constructed with a sleek, functional design and provides additional hours of charge. I am now considering purchasing other Tozo products.GS",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0

"Very compact and low profile. Ear buds and case arrived with almost a 100% charge right out of the box! I find the sound quality great and clear. This is my first time with touch ear buds so this will take some getting used to but I like the idea behind it. Battery life is amazing, used 1 ear bud almost my whole shift, started at 815pm ran it until it auto shut off at 230am. That was a combination of streaming music and watching Netflix. And the case charged the ear bud super quick! Overall my experience as been amazing and I would recommend these to everyone.",4,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0

"I received these headphones about 1 month ago and enjoy them a lot. The sound quality is amazing, they block out noise well (I use them in the office) and have a good battery life.  The hardest thing about these headphones to me was getting the correct ear bud size. Once I did that, no problems. My only complaint is taking them out of the holster is a bit difficult, other than that, these headphones are really good for the price. I haven’t used them on an airplane yet, so that will be something I can’t comment about. Overall, satisfied with this purchase.",5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0

If I could give 10 stars I would. Once you open the box you can tell that this a high Quality product is packaged nicely it’s sleek and modern I’ve never seen any Headphones ever that came with that many different sized ear pieces.

I normally use the standard buds that came with my iPhone and have a pair of BOSE QC35s for serious listening, but honestly - the levels and sound that come with these is remarkable given what they cost.The touch controls and battery life were also really important to me and both are great.

"Overall ok pair of earbuds. Fit was very comfortable and no issues with battery life though not particularly outstanding. Out of the box they sound very bright and pretty harsh on the ears. On computers or apps on mobile that allow you to use an equalizer this can easily be fixed and they sound great, but unfortunately some phones (iPhones) don’t have a native system equalizer so this can’t be fixed on many apps you’d use these earbuds on. Hopefully a companion app is released to allow for EQ adjustments or they change their tuning out of the factory.",3,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
This pair of headphones is great if your on a budget and don't want to fork out $100 plus for airpods or beats or the like. They work great and are so comfortable to use. They connect to both Apple products as well as android with ease. Bought this back in Nov. 2019 and recently the charging case wouldn't charge the buds. Warrenty is 1 year. I got into contact with TOZO and they were more than happy to send a new charging case to me for free. Staff was super friendly and helpful and got back to me super quick. I would totally recommend this to anyone.,5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
"I am impressed with this little wireless earbud. The sound quality is great, it's sleek and it reminded me of Apple products when you open the case.

I really wanted to love these and I do...80% of the time.",3,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0

Great value wireless earbuds. The bass could definitely be deeper but the sound quality is clear. It connects easily to my iPhone 11 and Cromebook. There are other earbuds that have longer battery life but they don’t connect to the new iPhones. I have small ears so they look a little large but that’s really not a big deal. Overall well worth the money.,4,1,2020-3-24,1,0,0

I’ll admit I was a little nervous with so many positive reviews (if it’s too good to be true....) but read some independent reviews and things seem to check out. Good little ear buds and a great value.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0

"Overall I'm very happy with my purchase of the t6.  They are smaller than many earbuds yet not exactly exactly tiny. Using the standard ear cups that came attached to it has worked fine for me. But many choices of sizes are included.My only reservation which is minor is that they are sometimes difficult to remove from the case, as they have a shiny finish.  I have solved this by wedding my fingers just a little bit rubbing them together to bring up some moister and then removing them.  although I like the black clean and shiny look I wish they had a little more texture to make this process easier.",4,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
Got one workout in. Didn't get choppy sound when going to the water fountain on the other side on the gym away from my bag with my phone  in it. stayed in place very well.

Every time I take it off the ear the left bud disconnects. Then I have followed the instructions to pair it again but most of the time I am out of luck. After several tries if you successfully pair both of them next time you take them off the pairing is lost again. I am used to the apple airpods and their  seamless connection. So this experience is frustrating for me. Too bad this awesome buds has this kind of issue.,2,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0
"I reviewed quite a few other wireless earbuds, and the TOZO T6 earbuds were the ones I always came back to. I'm always a little skeptical when purchasing something without trying it first, but to my surprise these earbuds exceeded my expectations! The sound quality is amazing, they're lightweight and super easy to use and pair, right out of the box. I was also pleased with their customer service. I recently lost an earbud, I contacted them and they replied very quickly! Even told me they would send me a new earbud for free! Amazing!I will definitely be recommending them to all my friends.",5,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"Excellent sound at this price point. Substitute Comply ear tips for a better seal (and therefore better isolation and bass).Right earpiece died prematurely (after 5 months), and company providing replacement despite being beyond the Amazon return period.",4,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
"Exactly like the pics. Powers on automatically when pulled out of case and powers down when in case.Each earbud controls play pause, but only one controls volume up/forward and one controls volume down/ backwards.",5,1,2020-9-4,1,0,1
I bought this for my son so he can use it with iPhone X. He loves to use these earbuds. The sound quality is top-notch and the bass is very good. The added bonus of the wireless charging is amazing. I am so glad that I bought these for my son and He thanks TOZO for the great earbuds.,5,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"I never leave remarks or reviews. However for me, this has to be maybe the worst purchase made. Sound quality is not good, volume is not so good and NONE of the ear pieces would stay in. They also do not hold a charge very long either. For the cost, I did not expect pro level audio but expected more than what I think I received. I used them for music. The wifi signal drops when I walk around and the optimal range is about ten feet.  At this point, it was too late to return them so they are now collecting dust in the closet and I am back to searching.",1,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"I got the earbuds and used them just as I intended, for work while driving, and while riding the motorcycle. They worked great the one day I got to use them.  Unfortunately they fell out of my pocket at some point while they weren’t in my ear,  but I’m gonna get a new pair.  Great quality, great fitment, great sound.  Just don’t lose them on the second day like I did.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
They work very well and it has some beautiful packaging. I typically keep one in at work for 5 hrs at a time and the battery has lasted me so far. only issue I've run into is having the earbud lose connection to my phone in my pocket but it happens pretty rarely and reconnects within 10 seconds,5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"These fit well, sound good, are reasonably priced, and the touch controls work! Very happy with the purchase. And no more cords! I also was unsure if this came with different sized ear inserts. But it comes with a total of 6 different pairs for different sized ears as well as different levels of noise blocking. The only downside is the instructions, while clear, have a bit of broken English in them. By no means a deal breaker. Perfectly understandable and legible. Overall I do recommend!",5,1,2020-8-4,1,0,0
"If you are mainly getting these to listen, DEFINITELY recommend. I have noticed at times, the mic quality when I speak can be a little fuzzy, but still better than a lot I have tried in this price range",3,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
I’m loving these. They’re great for the price and don’t feel like plastic sitting inside my ears.  They’ve been used in water (though not under) and been great. They are one of my fav purchases to date.,4,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
They are good but I wish the sound could be louder but they do work well. I actually dropped these in a water bucket while I was at work and they surprisingly still work. The case is cool as it charges these and you can use a wireless charger at that. Like I said in the beginning the sound could be better but they are decent for what they are. Oh and the touch sensitivity is insane. So if you adjust them just be aware that you might pause you music or accidentally end a call.,5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"Too good to be true? Not for these headphones. I was skeptical because again, it seemed too good to be true with the price for the value of product but THEY ARE AMAZING. They are classy/chic, sound is amazing, and long lasting battery.Highly recommend!",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"So comfy in the ears! I am truly blown away with these earbuds!! I jammed 2-3 of my favorite tunes that have nice bass and these earbuds sound from incredible!! Played ""old town road"" by Lil Nas X & sounded great! Don't want to test their waterproofness yet. Overall, would recommend to anyone on the fence. If these ever break, I will definitely get another set. Plus carrying case is nice size, about 2"" square. Feels solid and looks great. Has light meter on front to show battery level & charging port at bottom of case has great deal to keep water/ dust out.",5,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"Compared to the wired Apple earbuds that came with my phone, these aren't worth the money. Battery life is only three hours. Sound quality is poor. Max volume is barely passable. Sound itself isn't full and rich.",2,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
"Good value headphones with some few problems, like keeping it onto your ears! rising and lowing the sounds! Can not compare with Bose or different other top brands! Not the same stuff, don't expect to have a top quality sound with those earbuds!",4,1,2020-3-9,1,0,0
"I really like these, not great on noise cancellation, and it doesn’t advertise that it is so, yeah. The sound quality is great!

"This product was MORE than I expected.  Set up was super easy and the sound quality is FANTASTIC.Controls are touch sensitive, so no worry regarding clicks or anything.  Single touch to pause, hold left side to lower volume, hold right side to raise volume...double tap to go forward on the right, back on the left...very intuitive.",5,1,2020-10-3,1,0,0
My wife has air pods and I didn't want to spend so much knowing that the batteries on ear buds eventually go bad. These sound just as good (I compared them) and pair just as well.  I pair them to my Apple watch and leave my phone at home.,5,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
The battery doesn't last nearly as long as I thought I would. The sound is ok but it doesn't get very loud. I use these for music at the gym and while I run and for that they are disappointing. They lose connection alot when you are around alot of people with bluetooth and have a hard time pairing again. I also use them for answering the phone because I am on the phone alot for work while I drive. They die by 2pm.,2,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"I liked the size of the headphones and the fact I didn’t have to have both in my ear. I also like the sound quality, but the sound button only worked 2x and did nothing. They also didn’t stay connected even though they were right next to my phone. Considering the rave reviews I must’ve gotten a defective pair, but I just put out the $80 to get a pair of Sony’s.",2,1,2020-10-1,1,0,0
I honestly love these ear buds. My ears are sensitive and these fit so comfortably! The sounds quality is great (its like surround sound in your ears) and blocks out any noise I've found. Highly recommend!,5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,1
"I was super excited to receive these as the reviews were awesome.  However I'm not sure how there getting such great reviews.  The quality of them seem to be built well, but the volume doesn't get loud at all. The bass was advertised to be great, but its at best comparable to a family dollar set of earphones. I'm highly disappointed and absolutely do not recommend these to anyone. I haven't tried the waterproof out yet, and honestly I'm skeptical of even trying them. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more and get something other then these.",1,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"I received the T6 headphones in January and have really enjoyed using them. Good sound quality and it is great not to be tethered to anything while listening. After having them for awhile the volume in each of the headphones began to be different ... one lower than the other. After a short amount of troubleshooting, Tozo honored their warranty and is sending a new pair free of charge. For now, the review is based on the good experience I had before experiencing the problem and the great customer service. Will update if the problem happens again.",5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"The sound quality is clear & crisp with great low, deep, bass response. The noise cancelling feature works really well. Wind noise while riding a bicycle was hardly even heard! The case is small enough to carry in your pocket. The battery life is very sufficient for the size and has one of the longest playing times out of all other 5 ear buds that I have tried.If you want really good quality, great sound & good battery life, these are the ones to buy!!",5,1,2019-12-15,1,0,1
These ear buds are pretty great so far! The sound is clear and ppl can hear me clearly while I'm on a call. The sound could be a bit louder but I'm not complaining. Excellent price.

"I was very hesitant to buy myself a pair of Apple AirPods. I couldn’t justify spending so much on headphones. I had bought a pair of cheap air buds and they were awful. Then I came across these gems and I am in love! I didn’t expect much because they were only $40 but they blew me away! The sound was amazing, the bass was impressive and more importantly people could actually hear me when I was on the phone with them! If you want a pair of AirPods that won’t break the bank these are the ones for you!",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0

"I lost my wireless earbuds and needed a replacement. After doing some extensive research online, I landed on these. After losing these, I had been borrowing my wife's AirPods. The sound on these is incredible—talk about the bass! It's nicing having the touch controls. As earbuds, they do a really good job of keeping sound out. The call quality with the microphones is good. So far, the battery life is stellar. I love these and can't recommend them enough. Comparing them based on price alone, it's a great deal!",5,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
"Love these things. I can go all day with just charging them in the case. I normally have problems with ear buds falling out of my ears. I put these in and they just stay. I've been using them everyday for 2 weeks now, at work and the gym. They stay where I leave them. They sound great and battery lasts forever. I have used them to make calls. Sound great on my end but other person says they can hear am echo. I'm going to buy a second pair so my wife can have her own. Buy them you won't be disappointed.",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
I bought These earbuds after “donating” my AirPods to an Uber Driver.  I figured If I am going to loose them anyway I could lose Three or four sets of these for the same price...I was Very pleasantly surprised that the sound as quality was better than I remembered the actual Apple brand being. I will Be buying a back-up set for rotating on hiking trips.,5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0

"I’ve only had these earbuds for a day so I’m not 100% sure of the battery life yet, but so far so good!! They’re pretty comfortable and they come with different sizes of pads to accommodate various earholes. Touch the left bud twice to go back a song or start a song over. Touch the right bud twice to go forward. Touch either once to pause and unpause. Super easy controls! Haven’t used it for any phone calls yet (who uses their phone for that anyway? LOL) so I don’t know how that is yet. And I also haven’t tested the waterproof ability yet. What I do know is that pairing with your device is easy. In conclusion, I like them.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0

We repurchased the same pair bc we think it was just a fluke.These were great earbuds until they stopped charging after 60 days. Buy the protection plan.,5,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0
"For this price point, the sound of the earbuds are really good. These are probably the first earbuds I've owned under $50 where I feel a punch from the bass tones, which really helps round out the sound spectrum. Very nice.Also, my ears have a tendency to hurt from wearing True Wireless Earbuds, but not with these. They are small enough that they don't put pressure on my ears when I'm wearing them. That's a huge win for me!",5,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0

"After reading many of the reviews on this product, I can honestly say that this set of wireless earbuds has met all of my expectations. They are very comfortable and the sound quality is great. The Bluetooth pairing is extremely simple and continues to stay connected throughout the whole house.  The touch controls take a while to get used to and work great as long as you are using both of the earbuds at the same time. If you are using only one, volume and track movement is limited to only one direction depending on which earbud you are using at the time.

Great product. I’ve been wearing one side till it dies then switching to the other. Lasts 5 hours listening to music. One negative is that the left earbud controls rewind and volume down and the right controls volume up and fast forward so if you’re only wearing one side at a time you can’t access all the controls without pulling out your phone.  Love these though.,5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0

"These earbuds are the best for the price  I've purchased in my life. I'm extremely picky with sound. I'm a musician that not only plays instruments but I know about sound engineering. And that changes everything. These earbuds deliver A LOT of sound isolation. Practically 100%. I won't lie and say they are noise cancelling, bc that's a distinct feature that can be turned on and off that these earbuds don't have. They are really really good at sound isolation, though. (Look up the difference) For this price, you're not finding anything else like these. I even prefer these to the Apple airpods! Anyway, you will not be disappointed!",5,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
Can’t speak to reliable as Amazon is asking for review one week after receiving. But they pair fast and effortlessly. They sound a bit better than my last buds and I thought those were great. They stay in fairly well with proper earpiece attached. They charge with rubber earpiece attached so no fumbling with pieces. Easy functions with light touch. Not sure what else you could want. These are darn near perfect,5,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"This is honestly the best purchase I've ever made! I love listening to music and podcasts when I do chores and cooking. Wireless ear buds tend to be on the pricer side, but this pair is very affordable. I love that they're noise canceling too. It blocks out all the noises from the tv and dog while I clean the house.The battery life lasts a decent amount of time too. I did have it die on me a few times though, but I do listen to them for long periods of time. It doesn't bother me too much because they charge fairly quickly.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0

It wasn't hard to find ones that fit perfect, and cancelled the outside noise very well. After five minutes you forget you have them in your ears.  I walk for two hours three days a week and haven't dented the battery life.If you're still looking for quality wireless earbuds, these are the ones!",5,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0

Long story short the whole case was left in the pocket of my leggings and well they went though an industrial washer at the laundry mat.. I dried them out (didn't even do thr rice method) and charged them up after a couple days of sitting of course.. and they still worked PERFECT😯 I was so surprised but thank you for making an awesome product!

I had an older model which I really enjoyed but the charging case stopped recharging. I came across this newer model as I was searching for a replacement. The form factor is nice; the charging case is sleek like apple's whereas the older model had a much bulkier case. The earpiece themselves are a little smaller than my older one but still feels snug enough when its in my ear.  6 different sized sets of plastic buds came with it which I don't think the older model had as much variety.

"I have been extremely happy with my TOZO earbuds, with the exception they seem to fall out fairly easily if I'm hiking or very active and sweaty.  I was swimming this past weekend in my pool and the left earbud now doesn't charge or work.  I communicated via Messenger with TOZO on 8/3 and immediately heard back on how to reset the earbuds to insure there wasn't an issue with the left one.  Resetting did not work.  They sent me a new set which I received on 8/7.  I was very impressed with their response.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,1
"I just received these yesterday. The instructions are great in terms of how to pair them and operate them. I haven’t had a chance to really use them, but I can see that charging the case is kind of awkward- the charging port cover is a bit in the way of the provided cord. It’s working, but I think I’m going to have to keep them still and stable while charging which isn’t a big deal.",4,1,2020-9-27,1,0,1
"So far these are great! they sound good, look good and feel very solid. I purchased a wireless charger from the same company so I figured these would be the same quality and I'm not disappointed.",5,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
We got 2 pairs of these yesterday.  One for me one for My Son.  They fit my 10 yr old son with the smallest tips just fine and I had to move down one size but have been great.  I use mine for work.  Usually one in and one charging.  I had to change after about 4 hours today but not sure if dead or Iscrewed something up.  Sound quality is fine but i am not an audiophile but if i was I would have spent more.  Not really active noise canceling but for the price do a great job.  I fell asleep in mine yesterday watching TV which i would assume is comfy.  Great product so far,5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"LOVE! With multiple bud sizes, the fit is perfect! The sound is great, the mic is lovely, and the only trouble I’ve had is trying not to lose the case in the couch cushion when it falls out of my pocket...  Tossing it on my charger pad is an amazing perk, too!",5,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0
"I have my Tozo T6 True Wireless Earbuds connected to my iPhone. Once initially connected it’s a seamless connection. I’m able to listen to prime music While I’m cooking, jogging or just swinging on the porch. They are comfortable in my ears. I really like them.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,1
"So, I'll be honest. I was a bit sketchy with these headphones since there wasn't a lot of reviews for this to begin with. But, I did take a leap of faith and I'm glad to say I don't regret the order at all. The sound quality is pretty amazing I must say, though I do question why noise-cancellation is a rating here when these earbuds noise-dampen at most. My only complaint is that the earbuds are a little tighter on my ears than I would have liked but overall, I'm still satisfied.",5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
"I use these earbuds to do excersice, they have the perfect size therefore they don't come out of the eats even if I do strong movements with my head. Also it's awesome that I can use them when taking a shower!!! These are the second pair of earbuds that I bought, my wife and I love them!",5,1,2020-7-19,1,1,0
"Got these because I was tired of running with my wired earphones which always came off my ears. So far I’ve only tried them for a bit, but they sound pretty awesome. Had to put on the smallest buds on, which are a better fit for me. I like how compact they are along with the case. And wow, the noise cancellation is great too. I’d have to get used to that. I’m happy with my purchase so far.",5,1,2020-6-25,1,0,1
"I use these to listen to audiobooks and podcasts, so my sound quality review has nothing to do with how they sound w/music. I use them one at a time and haven’t had any issues with them pairing or with swapping them out. I love that they will fit in either ear. I get between 5-6 hours of battery life before having to recharge the bud.",5,1,2020-5-29,1,0,0
They don't stay in my ear very well. The touch controls aren't reliable. I try to power off and it adjusts the volume. I have to pair them with my device almost every other use. You can use each earpiece separately which I like. Overall I liked my raycon wireless bluetooth headphones better.,2,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
Know the battery depends on loads of things.. if I am talking with them for calls..  listening to music.. with one or both connected..But the sound to me.. is really great... noise cancellation.. well not so much as far as l can tell..,5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"Great quality for the price. Gets the job done. I was not expecting these to be noise canceling, but I can't hear anything through them (unless there is a super loud noise close to me). Works across multiple devices (not effortlessly but very well). Charge held for roughly 6 hours straight while in use before they died.",5,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
These are my first completely wireless earbuds and I like them. The only issue is they are difficult to get the first one out of the case which can cause some minor frustration when in a hurry.,4,1,2020-10-5,1,0,0
"When they work it's great however 25% of the time they are choppy or drop signal. Overall, avg , I wouldn't buy again and go for a higher quality pair at I a higher price point.Update: company contacted me to address my issues and make sure I'm 💯 satisfied.",4,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"I’m very particular about packaging, and this one is gorgeous! It’s very much a foreign brand, so it’s funny reading the instructions, but if you want to understand how to use these, READ THEM!!! There is a way to turn them off without running the battery off the charging case.  Also, the mic works really well, I tested it with my wife and she said it sounded like I was just on the phone with it up to my ear like normal.  It’s in the left earbud, if you needed to know that.  Interesting brand, bad English translation, but all-in-all, a great product!",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"Honest opinion having had apple air pods. For the price, you get waterproof, decent mic, decent noise canceling, wireless charging for case, 18 moth warranty, and decent sound. Not going to go out of my way to say they sound as good as airpods. But around $40, I can't complain! If you want premium sound and quality, spend premium money. Hate people who expect the world at no expense. I'm happy with my money spent so long these last till I lose them like I did with my air pods hahah",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
So disappointing. It worked great the first week but since then it won't stay paired for more than a few hours and frequently cuts out. Now one ear doesn't work at all. And I've only had it a little more than a month.,1,1,2020-6-20,1,0,1
I just got these today so it's taking some getting used to but I'm glad that I have something new and different and don't have to worry about wired cords anymore! And I got them at a great deal when I did as well!,5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,1
Sound quality of these ear buds Amos great.  But seems these ear buds are not good for taking calls as people can barely hear you.  Does anyone else also facing issue while taking calls with these ear buds. When I tried using this people were saying they could barely hear my voice. This is not the case with my skull candy's one.  Probably I have to return as my main purpose was for calling.,3,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
These are ok. They constantly just start playing music when not in use. They seem to constantly have a connection issue. They do stay out in my ear but the other problems kind of outweigh the good. Considering a return.,3,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"Battery case does not hold the charges as advertised, there is four LED light as indicating a full charge, after one charge, it drops down to one LED. Sounds great but the charging case is defective. The left side earbud makes plastic noise when inserting it into the ear.",1,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0

"This is a great product, they paired seamless right out of the box after I topped up their charge. They worked great in the rain this afternoon and even blocked out a lot of the sound of stated rain, their noise cancelation works wonderfully but isn’t the greatest, yet I believe that this is use error of me not finding the right size ear piece, they are really comfortable though and is you do have sound coming out of them,  they really do block out most sound.",5,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
"Just received a few days ago, so just early impressions. The quality of the material, and the feel of the buds was somewhat a surprise. I wasn't expecting garbage, but with an unknown ""off"" brand you never know. Everything works like it says it does. Sound quality is excellent so far. Not sure if these have sound cancellation. Comes w/ different size bud caps. fits pretty well. Overall pretty impressed so far. Only issue so far is the touch controls, some lag there, &/or user error.",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"I liked my first pair (T10) so much that when I lost it (warning: because they're wireless, they are relatively easy to lose while you're running or working out!), I got another pair. This is supposed to be an upgrade over T10, so I have high hopes. The only issue I had with my previous pair was that sometimes the volume was not sufficient, especially, in the noisy gym environment.",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"I enjoyed the process of buying this item all around. Delivery was super fast, the customer service team is amazing( ARLENE). Their products are great and they always have cool offers.

"Terrible product. Don’t buy. I did a lot of research and these appeared to be decent earbuds for the price. They’re not. They don’t stay in your ear and after about two months of occasional usage, one side was very muted and hard to hear. Did everything the company recommended and sent back for a replacement. Well here I am again with another pair that does exactly the same thing.",1,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"I got these for my grandson.  Of course I had to charge them up and try them out.  I listened to some music, watched some TV and watched one of the Avenger movies with these.  Seriously, I was totally impressed with these ear buds.  I enjoyed these as much as my on ear Bose headphones.  Very nice highs and midrange and perfectly balanced bass.  As soon as I scrape up &59.00 I'm buying myself a pair.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
I’ve been using these for about a  week or so. And they’ve been holding up pretty well. I use while at work and take them on runs. At first I didn’t think they would stay in my ear but after Messing around with them for a little bit I found the right position and have no issues while going on long runs. The sound quality is okay it does the job for the price. But overall this really don’t feel like cheap headphones and are worth buying if youre looking for wireless headphones at this price range. If I could have a redo I’d probably buy this again.,4,1,2020-5-21,1,0,1
"These wer super cute in color and the fact that they are pink, but they were just too big for me.  They are a bit bulky and stuck out of my ears. The sound quality was great but I had to send them back because the just didn't work for me.",3,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
I work overnights and have to have an ear out for questions and the phone. My shift is 10 hrs long 1 use 1 bud for 1st half of my shift and use the other for the last half; usually don't have to recharge the case until day 3 or 4 depending on weather or not I used my buds after work or while at home.,5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"They worked great, until they didn't work anymore. The Bluetooth range was exceptional. The sound quality was great. They were slightly uncomfortable, however this could be due to not having the correct buds attached. But they already stopped working.",1,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0
Really great for the price. Goes beyond what you pay for. Biggest perks is that the sound is good and the calling is perfect with these. When I make a call most people have no idea that I’m talking through earbuds because it’s so clear. I’d say biggest con is just if you were to lose your charging case it’s like a 4-6 week for a replace for 20 bucks so up to you if you want to pay 40 again for a new set with prime.,5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
The earbuds are pretty solid! Great bang for the buck and the quality of sound is nice. The battery lasts me about two days and I wear them basically when I commute and when I’m at the gym!

"These are epic. Came out of the box charged and ready to go, in great shape, and i still haven’t had to charge them and it’s been almost an hour.

"I looked and researched a lot on complete wireless earbuds since I like to workout and run. These are the best earbuds for the price! Once I changed the war cushions for a snug fit, they stay in place (even during burpees) and sound quality is great!

"After quite a bit of research, I selected this model or wireless earphones so I could enjoy listening to music while riding my Polaris Slingshot.

I highly recommend this wireless earphone as pairing, charging, and use was simple, easy, and completed with no drama whatsoever.",5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"So I finally bit the bullet & got totally wireless earphones. I was a bit skeptical as I got another pair that looked like AirPods that were absolutely horrible & broke immediately, but I decided to get these next because I actually like the design better.AirPods don’t fit comfortably in my ears but these are PERFECT. They fit snugly even without me changing the size of the rubber tips, & the sound is awesome. I tested the bass by using the song “Don’t Stop” by Going Deeper & it was great. I’d definitely recommend these - they’re not even expensive!",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"I'm very happy with these. I wanted wireless ear buds but didn't want to pay $150 for Air Pods. These are just as good. Can't hear a thing from the outside world when they're in my ears, and they STAY in my ears no matter what I'm doing until I purposely take them out. Can't speak on the battery because I haven't had them long enough, but I'm very happy with everything else.",5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
Update: after 8 months I made the mistake of keeping them in my pants and they went thru the washer and dryer. Still work perfectly fine.AMAZING!,5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,1
Very impressed with the quality packaging. The earbuds are very comfortable. Excellent sound quality. My last wireless earphones were the Bose Soundsport and I was not happy with those as they did not last despite light use. The Tozo earbuds are more comfortable and I feel the sound quality is comparable.,5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
I love the sound but if I barely touch to push back in ear when about to fall out it disconnects from a call or changes my song. Maybe need to change rubber pieces. But still I hate how it disconnects call or turn my music off.,4,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0
I really liked this product. When I first purchased I was skeptical. This is the first TWS product I have owned and was not certain of what to expect. The design is well constructed and it is a sturdy looking package. I am very pleased with my purchase as the audio that emanates from these wireless ear buds are fantastic. I was watching a movie on my iPad and the sound was amazing. I am purchasing two more of these for my kids.,5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0

Came super fast and my goodness I’m so glad! Why would you go with any other product?! Noise cancellation is super a and sound quality is crisp and comparable to much more expensive buds I have had that have died.

Honestly a great product, keep up the good work.",5,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
"I have used this since March and the only problem I have had with them is sometimes the earbuds lose connectivity for about 4 seconds before reconnecting. Other than that, these earbuds are awesome. They get pretty loud and with their noise isolation, you'll be hard pressed to hear anything else when you have them in. The sound quality is also superb for the price and the different sized tips making fitting into my ears nice and easy.

I adore them I was a bit worried since I'm pretty finicky when it comes to sound quality but this manages to have a solid deep bass without it ruining the over all sound and enables you to hear individual instruments without it smushing together. I do heavily advice sizing yourself property with the ear piece since I used the standard one and had some issues with fit and sound and the moment I went a size lower the change was astronomical,5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
I have had such trouble finding earbuds that fit my ears. I’ve tried all the expensive brands and have not been happy with the fit. The buds always ease out of my ears.

I bought this pair of headphones to replace an old pair that just broke. I am very please with the sound quality. When talking on the phone microphone works very well. When music is playing I usually have it on the lowest setting and this seems to cancelled out most sound. However when music is not playing ambient sound still gets through. Most of it is cancelled but you can still hear. Battery life seems to last a while. And with the charging case even longer. Great buy would highly recommend.,5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0

"Look if your like me you have been looking for the perfect pair of earbuds but are unsure if these are the ones to go with, well they are the price is fair they sound awesome they fit awesome they look awesome also a 1 year warranty I’m good with that because I use mine probably 21 hrs a day not 24 cause I sleep for 3.  I use them for work taking and making calls all day virtual assistant is easy to activate just three taps yeah they are touch controlled too so you don’t have to push the thing into your ear to take a call.  I think I e said enough like the title says these ARE the good ones",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,1
These earbuds are amazing. The battery life lasts about 5-6 hours. The sounds quality is better than my LG headset. These are water proof have taken them in the pool and shower. I really can't live without them. I can't really think of any cons about this product.,5,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
"These were pretty good for the price. The sound is passable, and they are pretty easy to use.My biggest gripe about them is when I'm actually doing something that causes me to sweat, the headphones randomly pause or activate voice control. They also fell out of my ears frequently when I was working out, no matter which earbud I used. They are pretty useless for phone calls, as well.",4,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0

"I was looking for discrete ear buds with a charging case but not the price of air pods. After reading several reviews I purchased the Tozo T6. I’m obsessed! These are amazing! They come with several sizes of ear pads. The default size is perfect for me. These are 100% not falling out. They look great, are small and the charging case is perfect for any purse/bag/pocket to hide. Mine are white, the case is a pearly white color. LOVE them!

Will be returning ASAP!",1,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"Hands down, best ear buds I've ever owned. Even the older versions of the tozo ear buds are better than anything else I've tried. Ever.

Don't even think about it, just order them",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
I like these except the battery dies so fast!!!!  I charge it all night and they barely make it to the middle of my day on conference calls.  Also the smallest rubber piece is still to big for my ears.  I want to return these mostly because of the battery life!,2,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0

I like that they can be wirelessly charged. They are a little hard to remove from the charging case as they are magnetically held in place. The case also has a built in battery for stand alone recharging. They include 5 different size silicon ear bud pieces. The package that they came in looked like Apple designed it.

There should be a way to do this.",4,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
Very nice buds.  I will say it is easy to inadvertently start or stop the music/audiobook you re listening to.

"The Tozo T6 earbuds are fantastic. I use them for all kinds of training from weightlifting, running, biking, rowing, jumping rope, and other high intensity cardio circuits. Once I figured out how to put them in my ears properly, which wasn’t hard to do, they never fall out of my ears, and they are extremely comfortable. They also have a great sound for all the kinds of music that I listen to while working out. Finally the carrying case is very small and convenient to take the earbuds everywhere. They are a fantastic bargain for the price.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
I wanted to write a review so anyone who wanted to order the new blue color can see what it looks like. I saw some other reviews saying the microphone is bad and people can’t hear them while on calls but I was told that I can be heard perfectly. I had to put on the smallest size for the ear thingies because I have reeealllyy small ears. There’s definitely a whole lot of sizes and I don’t think you’ll have many issues finding a good size for your ears. They don’t fall out of my ears and I have yet to encounter any problems.,5,1,2020-10-3,1,0,1

If you are working outside and get about 15 yards from your phone, the sound starts to break up.  Typically, this would not cause an issue since you have your phone on you at all times.",4,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0

I've used Airpods and Samsung earbuds and the sound quality on these is just as good but for a fraction of the price.  They do a great job with noise cancellation also.  I would 100% recommend to a friend and will probably purchase another set for my wife.",5,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0

I bought 2 sets for my husband and I these buds are amazing! I even bought covers for them to properly care. The convience of having no wires and use just one bud while working is top notch.

For now I have changed my star rating to 5.-OLD REVIEW-Bought these for my husband and at first he loved them. But now he’s had them for less than 4 months and the battery doesn’t hold long enough to finish a workout. He charges them all night and still no luck. Now it’s too late to return them. Don’t waste your money.,5,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0

Great buy.",5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
Received these for my birthday after burning my corded ones on the oven door. They were exactly what I was looking for! Easy setup and great sound. They do have a little noise when using for phone calls but only on the other person's side. Comfortable to wear and once you get used to the touch controls easy as well.  Definitely would recommend these for someone looking for solid wireless earbuds.,5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0

I work roughly 5 to 6 hours and the headphones remained charged. My job is very physical, so I move around a lot and lift heavy objects. After all that, not once have the headphones fell off. I also showered with them consistently for 5 days a week for a month and haven’t encountered any issues. The touch commands are very nice. U can increase/ decrease volume, pause, and skip all from touching the earbuds. The best part is the pricing when compared to competitors.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
I ordered two of these one for my dad and one for his girlfriend I helped him set it up on his phone and the sound quality is great as well as the noise cancellation but unfortunately one of his headphones did not work after the second day I emailed the company and they help me resolve the the problem in many different ways in the end they ended up sending me a new pair for the inconvenience this is my first time ordering from them and I love the sound quality from these earbuds I will be looking forward to buying more product from them in the near future.,5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0

I'm going to wind up with either of the 2 biggest. I'm hoping to find some flanged earpieces that will fit. My main in-ears are Etymotic ER-4's, so I'm not expecting these to match that, but I'd listen to these for long periods and be happy.

The Tozo T6 are well priced. The sound quality is great and so is the battery percentage. Some earbuds touch sensitivity are very low but on these I can say they might be a little too sensitive. When I have both in my ear when i pull one out I accidentally touch the pause button and my music stops playing but it’s not that big of an issue. Everything works on them so I’m happy about it.,5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
These are really great. I ordered these and a pair of SkullCandy ones. I preferred these over them. The sound quality it spectacular. They fit great after I changed out the little ear piece.

Previously owned the T10 and the T6 seems to have better sound quality. I am able to zone out all the noise around me with these on.

"These do work pretty well, a little tough to get out of the charger box with my big fingers. Noise cancellation is just ok. Plenty of volume, they work well on phone calls also. I use them mostly to listen to music off my phone.",4,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
"This is a good headset. The touch controls are, however, unresponsive most of the time and the only way to control it is through the phone. The sound quality is great and it connects to thE phone in a decent amount of time.",3,1,2020-3-1,1,0,0
"Purchased these for my son as a gift,  outstanding product,  has several small features like shutting off when you remove them from your ear and then automatically turning back on when you put them back in.  Very happy with this choice!!",5,1,2020-5-17,1,0,0
"I honestly am very content with what I spent on these. Like they stay in my ears, love the size options for the tips.. sound could be a LITTLE louder but it’s honestly not that bad, I still lower it on some songs. Bass is ok too. Like if you like loud depressing songs to the point where you wanna feel the song vibrate in your DNA, then you might have something to say about them not being loud, but if you can be like” hey Tozo, you did good.. good job. You came through” then these are perfect",5,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"The battery life lasts about 4-5 hours for me, and they constantly disconnect, usually when I’m right next to my phone. Sound quality for music and videos is okay, but not as clear when it comes to phone calls.",1,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"If you are looking for a good set of wireless earbuds the T6 Tozo are an awesome choice. Great sound quality and battery life, comfortable to wear. Comes with different size earbud covers to fit your ear. Nice to wear around the house getting stuff done from room to room hands free. Great for running, stays in place without the feeling of them falling out. Good quality sound for incoming calls, Receiving end of the caller has good sound, doesn't sound like you are far away. Does not feel cheap. A little on the bluky side. But overall well worth it.",4,1,2020-5-27,1,0,1
The noise cancellation is fantastic. I didn’t even hear my husband calling me. The sound is better than other headphones I have that cost twice as much. Can’t beat these for the price.,5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
Was super excited to get this only to be disappointed. After several emails with customer support at Tozo. I learned that the earbuds are not compatible with Apple. They actually told me I would have to switch to an Android. Super bummed.,1,1,2020-7-28,1,1,0
"I’ve learned over the past year that you don’t have to break the bank to enjoy a great set of earbuds! These will be hard to beat at any price point! They are comfortable, sounds great and noise canceling is good. I will recommend these to others!",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
excellent for the price.  it just works no hassle no issues. I got one side audio in my macbook pro but it was the sound profile in the mac with one sided balance (no sure why but it has been reported for several other products as well).,4,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"I was super excited to get these in from the reviews they seemed great.They paired fine and did just what the manual says they should do, however, when I go to listen I can barely hear anything. I have to keep them at maximum volume just to hear anything. I really don't think this is reasonable for a headset even if it does have some minimum noise cancelling.",1,1,2020-3-6,1,0,0
Just received my Tozo T6 wireless earbuds.  I like the touch pads much better than the T10's as I don't have to push so hard to activate the functions. Sound quality is pretty darn good again for the price. I like the fact they are no so bass heavy as I like to listen to a wide variety of music. Need to be a bit patient with pairing but once paired they seem to work just fine. I bought these for knock around and general road and business travel as I have lost 2 $200+ sets of Bose in the past during my travels. Overall pretty pleased and won't be upset if I loose these as I'll just buy another pair.,4,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
Some of the best wireless earbuds they are great for working out. When at work I only use 1 earbud because they fit snug and drowns out outside noise. The only bad thing it's the battery doesn't last long but with case you never have to worry about them dying.,5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0

The earbuds are quite good. Cancels noise perfectly and has long battery life which is very convenient. Has great sound quality too. One little drawback is while talking the other person can hear surrounding noise louder than my voice. Worth trying.,4,1,2020-8-18,1,1,0
"This T6 earbuds are very comfortable to wear and the sound is very good. The controls on the buds are convenient. The manual is concise and well written. I paired the earbud with my notebook and phone in 30 seconds.I wish that the left and right could be distinguished readily, I use a small piece of colored tape to recognize the right earbud. All in all I am very happy with the purchase and may buy another pair for my wife who has very small ear canal.",5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0

"The touch controls on these earbuds are very imperfect and unpredictable. Twice now, just taking them out of my ear and handling I’ve caused the earbud to take control over my phone and FaceTime a random member of my contact list. One time this happened at 2am in the morning. I really wish these did not have the ability to control my phone.",3,1,2019-12-24,1,0,0
"These work wonderfully. I use them to listen to podcasts at work, and for music when working out, works great for both!

"I've had these earbuds for about 4 months now and I have to say they are the best earbuds I've ever owned by far. I wear these things most all day 5 days a week and they cause absolutely no ear discomfort. The sound is good and I really like the form factor of the charging case as it fits well in my pockets. I bought and returned 3 pairs of Bluetooth earbuds before I purchased these, I would definitely recommend the Tozo T6 buds.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
Wish the English was better for the confirmations. Also wish it would pair with 2 devices so I don’t have to switch back and forth between my work and personal phone. Still it is a good product with clear sound and a comfortable lightweight fit to wear for hours.,5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,1
"I was very excited about the earbuds. The reviews posted about the earbuds are spot on. The ease of operation, the simplicity of the controls, and the sound quality. I'm not an audiophile, but I love the depth and quality of the sound. I will proudly wear the T6 earbuds.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"I was hoping that these would be a decent pair of earbuds. I received them, charged them, and used them.  They worked great. Sound quality is excellent. There seems to be no noise cancellation, so outside they are a little hard to hear.  The ear gels were big for my ears and that may be part of the problem. I contacted support and they are sending me smaller ear gels so I'll see how that helps. I would recommend these and would buy them again. BTW, the battery life seems to be excellent.",4,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
"I bought these earbuds so that I could listen to my workout music while I worked out! So far, I haven’t had any trouble with them coming out of my ears while I’m doing my PIYO routine. Battery life has been excellent. I only had to just now charge it after over a week of use.",5,1,2020-5-19,1,1,0

Just bought these to replace my old ear phones and I must say they are amazing! No more cords just put them in your ear and go. I use them all the time when I work out and you don’t have to worry about the loud grunting of the guy next to you.,5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"Every time I try to adjust the pods in my ear, they stop the music, or turn off, or try to access some function of my phone.  They would be better without trying to add all that functionality to the pod itself.  They also will not connect to my Computer, and often just one will turn on.  With that said, the sound and noise cancellation is excellent.",3,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"This is my first pair of wireless headphones and I’m surprised at how pleased I am. The first thing that struck me was the noise cancellation. My husband was talking to me loudly and I could barely hear a noise - I almost thought he was pulling my leg and only pretending to talk.I’m also pleased with the fit and the variety of size options on the buds. Most headphones give me pain in my inner ear after a while, but I haven’t experienced that with these yet.",5,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
Do not buy these earbuds! They worked for the first month. Now do not hold a charge; will shut down after using for an hour regardless of starting fully charged.  Sometimes do not fully charge despite charging overnight and using different methods (direct or USB). Ear wax must be cleaned often as one earbud may be lower or no volume. Had to Google this to find the problem. They do NOT automatically turn on at the same time when pairing. I often have to pair twice before both will turn on and pair successfully.,2,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"Fast and easy shipping from amazon. These rival the AirPods. They’re extremely comfy in my ears and that’s usually hard to find. I have T10 and T6’s. I prefer the 6’s for my ears because of their battery life, size, and lightweight.",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
"The earbud sound quality and noise cancelling was good. They fit well and don't fall out of my ears. The charging case is compact and easy to carry. I had to get used to the tapping commands as they were a bit sensitive. Sometimes I would brush my hand slightly over the earbuds and that registered as a tap. Sometimes my tap commands did not seem to register at all.But when I was just listening and not struggling with the tap commands, the sound and fit was satisfactory.",4,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
"The sound quality is the same as Apple AirPods! The microphone quality is good, unlike many other products out there which have decent playback quality but very low quality microphones.

"Fully recommend as a sub-optimal substitute to the AirPods. The case is just as small and ergonomic as the apple AirPods (original), but the buds themselves are built for prime listening (with their in-ear silicon tips) much like the AirPods Pro. Plus I think the biggest benefit is that there doesn't seem to be a very master noticeable master/slave listening quality. The quality out of both earbuds is fantastic. It doesn't sound louder or lower in either earbud.Probably going to buy a pair of these myself! Definitely worth the purchase",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
Just received this product a couple of days ago and used them 2x.  On my walk this morning one bud fell out.  Maybe I didnt have it in security.  The sound and ease of use are great.  Haven't had long enough to know about the battery.,5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0

"Great value for money. The earbuds cancel out just the right amount of noise. Sometimes I cannot even hear if someone is trying to talk to me and get my attention. The comfort is nice, you definitely have to play around with the different ear bud sizes to get the right fit. Sound quality is superb.",5,1,2020-10-2,1,0,1
Stay in my ears better than my Jlabs. I like the different size ear tips to better seal in the bass. They are very light and I can even lay on my side with them in my ear without hurting.I got these on sale for $25.,5,1,2020-6-28,1,1,1
I don’t normally wear earbuds and didn’t want to spend an astronomical amount of money for something I will only be using twice a week most of the time. A friend recommended these earbuds so I purchased them and am pleased with them so far. Easy and ready to setup right out of the box. Sound quality was excellent. I like that this came with six options to choose from for ear size. The case acts as a charging station for earbuds and the earbuds are magnetized to pop right into place within the charging case and keep them there to prevent them from accidentally falling out. Thanks.,5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
Today is my first day using these earbuds and I am very impressed so far! They came almost all the way charged (90%) so I liked that I didn't have to charge them before being able to use them.  They were super easy to pair and sound is amazing! Fit is comfortable (many sizes to choose from!) and they feel secure like they will not fall out. The touch features work great and are very responsive. This is my first pair of wireless earbuds and I am highly impressed so far especially for the price!,5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0
I am throughly impressed with my TOZO T6 wireless headphones.  1) So easy to pair and set up 2) comfortable in the ears 3) multiple plastic ear pieces come with it 4) Cancel's out other noise well 5) Sound quality is great - loud and lots of bass!  These have hit it out of the park for me.  Oh and they can be worn in the shower...bonus!,5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0

"I liked the quality of these headphones and they work well.  My only concern with them is they are a bit hard to get out of the container and also if you just touch them while in your ears they activate or pause what you are listening to.  I would prefer that I have to push a button on each earphone as these seem really sensitive to touch.Other than that, they are good quality and sound well.  I use them for meetings so I don't have to have a dangling cord.",4,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"Just got these today. Impressed with the build quality and ease of pairing, they are also very comfortable and fit well/securely.  I have not used them enough yet to comment on battery life but so far very happy and the price is a lot less than AirPods",5,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0

"I love these, I ran and played around with my kids with one ear piece in, didn't fall out. Sounds great, I've had no issue with battery life, connect and disconnects with my phone easily, very comfortable. Touch sensitivity gets a little annoying as it responds to pretty much anything and not just my finger but it's not a big deal and I tested out all the call features and it was fine, the sound is weird from the other person's perspective but still can hear me clearly.",5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"It took me a while to get the right ear covering but after I found the right one, the sound quality was really good.  One thing I like is that i don't have to touch the ear piece hard to activate the feature I need.  I really like the  ""sensitivity"" of  them. They are ""sensitive"" yet not to where they are unacceptable.  I would highly recommend this set of ear buds.",4,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0

I've been using them to listen to videos and music whenever I'm bored and they sure do last a while.If you're looking for some simple wireless earbuds that won't break the bank, look no further. They also do provide some noise cancelation as long as the environment noise isn't too loud. My only con would be that they could be louder. Other than that, they're great!",5,1,2020-6-10,1,0,0
"I use these everyday for multiple hours at work, and no one even knows they are in. Super happy with them. I am a very pale white girl, and I bought the baby pink ones. (I think it says rose? They are definitely light pink) Only “con” might be that they have great noise canceling so they are kinda like ear plugs and it’s difficult to understand people talking even when they are off. To counteract this, I usually wear one at a time so I don’t get caught.",5,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
First I'd like to say that these earbuds work very well I love them use them all the time. I made the mistake of wearing a smaller earbud just so I could reduce the noise canceling effect. Then I lost one of my earbuds in the grass. I searched everywhere and I could not find it. I decided to contact the manufacturer to see if I could get a replacement. They were quick to response and offered to send me a new pair free of charge.,5,1,2020-10-5,1,0,0
"The TOZO T6 wireless earbuds are simply the best purchase I’ve made in a very long time.

They were great first two times I used them and now they cut in and out. Thought it wasn't close enough to phone but still did it when phone was in my pocket.

Happy with these. Sound quality is good. Battery life is good. Kinda hard to get out of the case but so are airpods. I use them for several hours nightly. Ears canals were slightly sore from the inserts but got used to them in time.,5,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0
"This is my 2nd set of wireless earbuds. My first set of a different brand were ok, but too bulky for consistent use. These Tozo T6's are awesome. Fit great in my ear vs other earbuds that typically loosen and fall out easily even with the over the ear loops. Sound had plenty of bass and room for cranking the volume if desired. Charging case and earbuds feel and look high quality, especially for the price. Would definitely recommend.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"(Update July 25) It didn’t work on shower or swimming. When water hit the headphone it would stop or lower/raise the volume. I tried different size silicone tips but It keep falling off my ears.I had the T10 but it was bulky and it was hard to press to pause/play. I like that this one is smaller and love the touch control. To my husband it was little hard to remove from charging case but I have small fingers so I don't care, it was fine for me.",3,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"I have been using these for a few months at work now. I love them. They fit my ears well, even without music playing they almost cancel out all noise.  Its easy to pause, move to the next song, replay or go to the song before all with a tap of the ear pod. They hold a charge well. For the price of these, I 100% think these are worth it and I always recommend them.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
I would say the sound quality on these is light years better than the T-10's. The case is also smaller and fits in your pocket much better. Overall a great upgrade and I'm happy I went with these!,5,1,2020-10-4,1,0,0
"I really liked the professional presentation. I really felt like I was receiving a high end item, and after using them I still feel the same!I just got them today and I am already in love. I popped them right in and went right to the gym, extra bonus that they came charged! The little booklet with it was also really helpful for figuring out all the different features along with it. In the end, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase, while also saving a ton of money compared to products like AirPods pro.",5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"I bought these because they were on sale for a really good deal. So far I have used them once, in a high noise environment. I played them at max volume and they lasted the advertised time, the sound quality was good but I wish there was more hard-hitting bass. Still, the bass was pretty good for the earbuds. The earbuds were easy to pair too. The sound would sometimes cut in and out but I think that was a user problem because my phone was in my pocket. Overall, the product works as advertised and I am happy with my purchase!",4,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
"Good product. I've never owned wireless earbuds before, but these sound just as good as regular headphones, but without the wires. So nice to not have wires in the way and accidentally ripping them out of my ears. I ordered the rose gold, but they look pink like the picture. I just got them today, so far so good. I recommend!",5,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
I do a lot of running so I wanted earbuds that could hold up in wet conditions. I sweat a lot. So I bought these and so far they are holding up really well.  They also sound great. Great value for the money.,5,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"Good earbuds! Great price. Decent sound with good bass and noise cancelling. Super easy to connect. Nice ear fit. Great size, nice and compact, can't even feel or see it in pocket.

"I am very pleased with these wireless earbuds. They sound great and stay in my ear well. The wireless charging case is very convenient My wife owns a pair of T10 earbuds that I’m constantly borrowing. I like these even more than hers.

"My Beats wireless headphones broke and I needed to replace them.  My primary use is while working out.  I reviewed several products (including Beats & Bose) and chose the TOZO T6 based on the positive reviews.  I have used the T6 earbuds several times and am very pleased with their performance.  Sound quality is good and the ""touch"" technology is great... very user friendly!  The fit is also very good, as I have never had any issue with them falling out during rigorous workouts.  As the headline states... Great product for the price!",4,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"super easy to pair, they automatically turn on when you pull them from your case, which is sweet, you can manually turn them off. i use them in my office, you can plug one back in and it wont disturb the sound quality of the other one in your ear. when you pull it out of the case its almost instantly re paired and continues playing your music. call quality is amazing, and everyone says they can hear me loud and clear. worth it. id buy again so far.",5,1,2020-4-9,1,0,0

Bought a cheaper pair of wires earbuds last year and they didn't hold up to this one. This has a way better sound quality and noise canceling way better. Better features as well. Only thing I have problems is it randomly disconnects it self for no reason. But worth little extra I payed so far,4,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"The idea of touch control is great. However, anytime I have to adjust them when running (frequently) it stops whatever I’m listening to. Or, worse, it goes into reverse mode. Also, maybe my bike helmet strap hits it? When riding the volume constantly turns off and I have to manually turn it back on via my phone. Save your money and get something less frustrating.",2,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"I mainly bought these for work to listen to music and take calls. It connects easily to my phone, great quality, and the size is good. They also fit good in my ears, don't fall off. The headphones are great for listening to music, but when it comes to calls its a whole different story. No one can hear me on calls, I just end up taking them off and using my phone. The microphone in them isn't good. If you are just using them for music I highly recommend them but for taking calls and using the microphone, I would get another pair of headphones.",4,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0
I just purchase the t6 version . the sound blew me away. not what I expected . the fidelity of the sound is on the high end. I have the ipods and I ratter use these . other thing I noticed is that the earbuds can be connected to 2 different sources. that was unexpected and found out by mistake. overall I will buy these again.,4,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0
I was really pumped for the design and all...but then the connectivity totally blew. I still haven’t been able to fully use them because they won’t connect to my phone for more than an hour. Then I have to forget device and re-search for Bluetooth connection,3,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0

"I work at a zoo using a leaf blower every morning while these don’t block out the entire noise it cuts it down by about 60%. They fit great and sound great. Haven’t had them lose power since using them. I used them for three hours straight which I know is bad for my ears, but the battery life was still going strong.",5,1,2020-9-29,1,0,1
When I first got these earbuds I charged them immediately and used them once the case had 4 white lights to know it was fully charged. I connected them to my phone with ease and started to listen to music. They sounded amazing!!! Then I called some of my friends to test the microphone quality and they said it sounded really good! Better than the original airpods microphone by a lot. I am very satisfied with my purchase.,5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"The ear buds are small, unobtrusive, and deliver high quality sound. Pairing is effortless. The case is a most convenient way to carry them when not in use, and to charge them. My only concern is that the microphone is not as good as the wired one I used before.",5,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of my earbuds. The sound is great and for not having noise cancellation, they sure block out a lot of sound.

The sound quality is the best I've seen on any earbud! The packaging is very professional. If somebody told me they got these for $100 I'd believe them.Update:,4,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"They work perfectly for a while, PERFECTLY.  After a few months, they don't stop looking for a source to connect with, even in the charging box.  The battery wears down on phone and ear buds because of continuous searching.  After a while, they continue to play music IN THE charging box - there is no way to reset - no off button.  Even if blue tooth is turned off on all electronics, the airbuds continue looking for source.  TOZO is a great company to deal with, they responded immediately and replaced the earbuds.",5,1,2020-7-22,1,0,0
"These ear buds have high quality sound when you wear one or both. They are compact and can be carried around anywhere. Charging is extremely easy. They also have several sizes of buds which was very important to me because I have small ears and my husband has big ears. Easily pairs with my phone and love the fingerprint option. Not sure what the more expensive buds provide, but this is an excellent choice.",5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0

These ear phones only last 3 months before they break. The first pair I had wouldn't charge after about 3 months. The second pair wouldn't turn off so I had to charge them continually through out the day. THESE ARE JUNK!!!,1,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0

"These headphones are perfect for my daily casual usage on the train. When compared to the T10s, they connect a lot faster to my iPhone and seem to have a better battery life. They stay in well due to the multiple sized earbuds, and the microphone is actually clear for people to understand if you're on the phone. The best part is the condensed size of the case, much smaller the than other ones I saw online. Also, they look a lot better than airpods!",5,1,2019-10-15,1,0,0

Cant believe how easy it was to pair. Very comfortable fit. Cant believe the price. Sure beats my beats wires ones which have too much base and not as balanced. I real saver in that no one next to you hears what you are listening to.,5,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0

I love these headphones. Great sound and battery life. The only bad thing is they lasted me 4 months. No drops no exposure to water they just stopped charging.Update: TOZO reached out to me and were gracious enough to send out a new set of earbuds. Great customer service. Looking forward to receiving the new set.,5,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0

"I found these by accident, and it turned into one of the best audio purchase I've ever made. I don't have any personal experience with the premium brand wireless earbuds, so I can't compare them. That being said I don't expect these to match them in sound quality, but for the money the TOZO T6's sound really good! The buds and the case have a premium feel. I had a discount that was applied at checkout, so I only paid $43. I highly recommend these for those who want good quality without spending a lot of money.",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"Biggest issue with these was falling out of the ears constantly, even when just sitting down and not walking.

I don't know if the wireless charging works on mine as I don't think I have a charging pad that is supported. But battery life is great. Just about as much as airpods. The bad thing though is it's really easy to accidently pause music taking out one earbuds from my ear. Just have to get used to handling the sides of it. Overall very happy with my purchase would reccomend for a cheap airpods alternative.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"I bought these to use for walks in the park. I’m pretty small (5’2”) and they fit in my ears just fine with the smallest buds that come in the kit.

I’m very happy with this purchase and thrilled to be done untangling earbud wires :)",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"I was actually surprised to hear the amount of bass that these had. I had read reviews that I should not expect these to stay in your ear during a workout. I did not have the same experience. When I first got the head phone they had the medium size cushions. I changed then down to the smallest size becuase the mediums would like pressurize in my ear, maybe the noise canceling but I didnt like the feeling.

Sound quality is solid and other people report they can hear me clearly when talking on the phone. Finally, the earbuds charge quickly in the case.",5,1,2019-11-6,1,0,0
"Fast delivery, great battery life and fast charging! However— I noticed immediately that the right earbud was much quieter than the left.

The product is good, but I may have gotten unlucky with this one.",3,1,2020-3-8,1,1,0

"Just received the T6 earbuds and I am impressed with the build, music sounds, range and bass. Pairing was easy, controls are a half second delayed but I quickly adjusted and it isn’t a problem.

This is a great upgrade from the T10 which I love and use daily. This case is a lot more sleek to use and almost or exactly the size of the AirPods case. That is great to just throw in my pocket as the other one is a bit more bulky. Also the touch feature is great for a more hands free experience from my phone. I love these headphones and will continue to use them along with my T10’s. You definitely cannot go wrong with these.,5,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
"The sound quality on these headphones is very nice. I love the waterproof quality of them, and that I only need to touch them for response activation to my phone. I haven't tested out the charge life, but they charge easily on a wireless pad or through USB.  There are 6 different sizes of earbuds and two fit me very nicely.

The sound quality both ways for calls is great and clear, BUT if you’re someone who listens to music a lot like me I wouldn’t say these are for you. Music quality sound on these is just okay.

I used them at the gym and after an intense warm up routine (I play basketball) they were still in my ears.  They are also pretty comfortable which helps for those extended work out sessions. Can't wait to take them on my next snowboarding trip.,5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
Sound quality is excellent.  Really good value.  Would like to see a model with Active Noise Cancelling.  I really don't see a difference between these and AirPods.  I wish I could just buy one.,5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"Not bad, sound is a bit low. They drop the signal very often. They are very sensitive to touch. I expected them to only react to my fingertips but they respond to touch from all object including my pillow which makes it hard to wear them in bed.",3,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"Just got them in today and they came in a day early, wouldve been two days early but postal worker took it to the wrong house. They fit nicely in my ear and the noise cancelling is spot on i cant hear anything when they are playing. The sound quality is alright do wish they had a little bit more bass to them but I plan on playing with equalizer in my phone to see if I can get it to come through a little better I haven't attempted a phone call with them yet so I can't comment on that. All in all I'm happy with them",5,1,2020-5-4,1,0,0
"They work fine, but I really wish the battery would last a little longer.  I have meetings pretty much all day, and these tend to die out at around 3pm.  So I gotta use my old headset as a backup everyday.",4,1,2020-3-25,1,0,0
"I've enjoyed these a lot, I use these at work, home, and while working out. The sound quality is amazing. The only issue I have is when I try running, they can come loose and I accidentally threw out the other size pieces so unfortunately I can't try the different sizes to prevent this issue. Aside from that, no issues. I've actually bought these/ similar models from Tozo as presents for Christmas this year.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0

These earbuds are excellent and are a great price. I like that the package comes with a variety of silicone ear pieces to ensure a good fit. The range of Bluetooth is incredible. I can have my phone on the second story of my house and go into the basement and not lose signal once. The battery lasts for a long time and the noise cancelling is excellent,5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0

"I love these earbuds. They are comfortable and don't feel like they will fall out of my ear (where as airpods do feel like they will fall out of my ear). They have great sound quality and I really like the ""touch controls"" and prefer them over physical buttons. The case is small and can easily fit into your pocket. They have super good battery life and, in my opinion, are better than Apple Airpods and also cost less than half of what Airpods cost. Overall, they are really good.",5,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
I bought these because I was tired of running/ working out with wired headphones or my phone dying while I had headphones in but didn’t want to spend $50+. Read the instructions to figure out exactly how they work and you will love them. They also come with 6 types of buds so you can find the best fit for you. Trying them out I was really impressed by how they work. I can’t wait to take them on a trial “run” and see how they hold up during a workout.,5,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"These are my first wireless headphones and man I wish I had gotten some sooner! Super easy to just pull out of the case and pop in the ears and bam they connect to each other and the phone, and I'm ready to go! I've been using them mostly for working out at the gym and they work great, staying in my ears, don't seem to be impacted by sweating. And the sound quality is pretty amazing, plus when I've taken calls the microphone seems to work really well too. Highly recommend, for the price, these can't be beat!",5,1,2020-3-15,1,0,0
"I decided it was time to ""break the cord"" and get a set of wireless ear buds.  I wanted a pair that had good sound and could be heard clearly on phone calls.

Recommend purchase.",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
"They look and feel great! I love the sound quality so far. They are super easy to use—from pairing right out of the box to the touch controls—no confusion or over-complication. They feel so secure. Even shaking my head quite vigorously trying to dislodge them, they stayed put. The passive noise-cancellation is shocking—with both earbuds in place external sounds were considerably muted and muffled. I am very happy with these earbuds and can easily imagine them being a favorite tech purchase even after the newness wears off.",5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0

I also noticed that when the music was off, the seal was so good it, it muffled outside noise.  I work in a noisy environment.

I was able to get an immediate response and made sure I was happy with the product.  Great customer service thanks  harvey",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"These are good for podcasts and youtube. However, they are horrible for music. They have like no low end and sounds a bit tinny. Also they are really big. I switched the ear bud things to the smallest and it didnt help. I like to use earbuds at night to sleep, but these are WAY too big honestly. I wanted these to replace my airpods but they aren't even close. The battery life is incredible however. So if quality doesn't matter at all to you then these might be good.",3,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0
Price which I paid for this is 1/4 of which I would have paid for Apply Air pods. Voice is much clear and battery life is also very good.

"These things work great, good sound, sturdy and they come with a ton of earbuds that are different sizes and firmness, the battery life lasts forever, I have not ever had them die on me, even when I have used them for over 4 hours.  The only hang up I have is that every once in a while the bluetooth link will randomly go out and come back on.

"Once I received these earbuds I immediately paired them with my iPhone, and they sounded great. Next I paired them with my Apple Tv because I like to watch Netflix with my headphones on. they worked great.

I have only had the T6 headphones for a short time, but as for now, I would recommend them.",5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
I own both the T6 and the Jaybird X3. The Jay bird is way crisper but the T6 has way more bass and the battery last longer. However the T6 fell out of my ears twice already so I'm going to see if foam tips work. Will update soon.,4,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0

"Just got these today, 1 day earlier than expected. I've been cycling through all types of Bluetooth earbuds. Hoping these are the answer. Replacing my 2nd set of Raycons which all of a sudden started playing music very softly. These fit in my ear better than the Raycons and don't need to be turned up as loud. Takes a little bit to get used to the touch control. Because it's not button controls, there can be times where you inadvertently pause the music when you don't mean to, but no big deal.",5,1,2020-4-27,1,0,0
Sound good and are comfortable. No issues with connectivity. Only drawback would be they’re not super loud but that’s any earbud for me so far. Beats dropping 100$ or more on a pair that do the same thing.,5,1,2020-3-15,1,0,0
My Tozos T6 are awesome! I bought these because I needed a cheaper option of wireless earphones and these have turned out to be the best wireless earphones I've bought so far.

They are good at noise cancellation and good sound quality and range.,5,1,2019-11-14,1,0,0
"Very good alternative to pricy competitors. They're sleek, functional and good quality at a great price. The design is flawless as far as I can tell, truly wireless! The touch controls are really good too, not too sensitive and super easy to use. The sound quality is pretty good too, it'd be nice if they had more bass, but that's just a personal preference.

The sound quality is really good, and the bass is amazing. They pair with my iPhone in less than a second. One small issue is that their touch pads are really sensitive, so even a slight brush will pause your media. Overall, worth way more than they cost!",5,1,2020-4-12,1,0,0

I LOVE these. I previously purchased the JBL 120TWS and was really disappointed. They had zero volume control on the buds themselves. I returned them ($60) and bought these instead.

Excellent set of wireless headphones! Easy to use and perfect for what I needed. I didn't want to spend $200 on a pair of wireless headphones. I needed a pair for work and when I'm running errands.

Super easy to pair and use. The instructions are very straightforward and are a must read in my opinion. Each ear bud has a touch button and actually works so well that you’ll find that you accidentally touch it and pause your music lol. You just have to keep in mind there is buttons there. Build quality is great. From the packaging to holding the ear buds and case in my hands. Feels like it’s a 100$ ear bud set. Sound quality is great obviously.,5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0

I would also like to note the range on these is amazing! Don't hesitate to purchase these, they work great, we have already purchased another set for my wife!",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
The thing I like the most is the small charging case which easily fits in small pockets and definitely saves space compared to other bulky cases out there.

Good wireless earbuds for the price.  They have great sound and last a long time without charging.  They connected pretty easy and I would absolutely buy them again.  Actually my husband bought them first and liked them so much he recommended I get a pair.  GOOD BUY!,5,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"These earbuds have excellent sound quality and noise cancellation for being as small as they are. Plus they fit very comfortably and come with multiple ear pieces to give you the best fit. The charging case is small and compact, making it very convenient to take on the go. Touch controls on each earbud makes it easy to them on/off, pause music, skip to next song, and control the volume. The earbuds are also water and sweat proof, which makes them great for working out. Best earbuds I have owned and the price makes a great product very affordable.  Well worth the purchase!",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"I haven't put these through all the paces just yet i.e. waterproof test, however I have used them for hours on end and the sound is great with good bass, battery lasts. They are comfortable, I had to switch to the shallower ear piece which allowed for a snugger fit. The case is great, feels like good build quality and has wireless charging which is very convenient given the micro-usb charging port.Overall I'm very satisfied with the purchase and would definitely recommend these.",4,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0

"I typically don’t write reviews, but I truly believed this is needed. These headphones are great. Inexpensive, great sound, and lack there of (noise cancellation), but the touch screen rarely ever works. That turned me off a lot because it’s just the main reason I wanted to test these out. But I will use them still just based off of sound quality. I would really like to see what their most technologically advanced product is like.",3,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
These are really great. I was desperately looking for wireless buds that would fit in my small ears they fit perfectly. Not only that but after sweating my life away during a workout they still didnt slip unlike countless ones I've tried. These are great. The range of their distance is pretty good. Callers say the clarity is good. Really satisfied. The only downfall is operating the touch because it's hard to remember how many taps on what side does what function and the voice assistant doesnt work but otherwise great product.,4,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"My old earbuds died and my wife had a pair of Tozo's, so I decided to try a pair. The order arrived in very quickly and, at least so far, they are working very well. They are easy to pair and use and the sound quality is very good. I would definitely recommend them.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0

The case is also small and fits perfectly in your pocket.",5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0

IMPRESSIVE sound at an affordable price.  With my first go straight out of the box I am impressed.  Nice bass that doesn’t muffle the highs and mids.  So far the only con I have is the case.

"These earbuds work very well for the cost. They stay fitted in the ear well, except when i get very sweaty on mile 2 of my run. The sound quality is good but the max volume isnt as high as other ear buds ive owned before. My only complaint is that after about 4 months of use the left charging pod wouldnt charge anymore. Also, they would keep turning on in my car connecting to my phone and cutting off the connection to the car. Decent headphines but disappointed with the durability.",3,1,2020-8-20,1,0,0
"These buds have a decent touch control system, nothing crazy, and not perfect but saves me from having to take my phone out for every little thing. It works, again, the touch control is not perfect, but is a game changer for me in a pair of affordable wireless earbuds.",4,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0

I would have given 5 stars but the earbuds worked well for a while but then unpaired itself from my phone. They will turn on and off but stopped connecting my my phone. Sometimes while using them they suddenly disconnects and no matter what I do they remain unconnected. Sometimes for days. Sound quality was good while they worked though.

I’ve only had to charge these once and I’ve used them for approximately 5-6 hours since then.",5,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
I purchased these bad boys a couple months ago and I am very pleased! Great sound quality and good fit (for my tiny ears). Much better than spending hundreds on Apple EarPods. They do disconnect from time to time for second or two. But that is usually when I am further away from my phone or in an area with signal disturbance. They’ve never died on me and I usually only have charge them once or twice a week. 10/10!!,5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,1
"Very good at earphones all around. Sensors are great. The case is really nice and it looks really similar to the AirPods case.

These are AWESOME! So thrilled that I was able to enjoy immediately.  Took about 10 min to figure out how to replace with smallest of 4 sizes and find where to charge the case.  Previously only Apple ear buds fit comfortably in my inner ear and I've had to replace them every 2-3 years with rising prices.  Thankfully this resulted in discovering these little gems that do WAY more.  I think the range is better than advertised because I didn't loose reception when I was outside with my dog.

This product worked perfectly.. For the first week. Then after taking them from my gym bag I had realized the right earbud didn't charge fully. Upon further inspection it appeared the right earbud wouldn't seat properly inside the case and wouldn't charge. Since it wouldn't seat properly it also would not disconnect from my phone interrupting my cars Bluetooth radio in favor of the headphones. I either had to unpair the earbuds or turn my Bluetooth off. Pretty annoying.,2,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"I used a Skullcandy brand headphones with the collar for years and they died recently. My sister swears by her AirPods but I didn’t want to spend that much.

I use them mostly when riding a lawnmower and you can still hear the mower but I’d say if you aren’t around noise much these would be the best bet.

I honestly loved these at first. They last a good few days but the headphones themselves just aren't really holding a charge. I guess the ear pieces themselves are charging up bit by bit so when I go to use them they sometimes last maybe an our or two sometimes even just a few minutes before they say the battery is low and shut off. So I'm just gonna return them and get something else. I use these for work and they're rather useless if them can't stay charged,3,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
I honestly just got the headphones today so I don't have a lot of experience with them yet but I have been using them for a little while and the sound and noise cancellation is awesome way better than I expected and I love the touch screen controls so u dont have to push them into your ear to change songs. the case is sick and it works with a wireless pad. they are very comfortable in your ears too they havent started to hurt at all. over all I am 100 % satisfied so far.,5,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0

Not sure if the issues is because I have an iPhone or not. Nonetheless, the receiving sound quality is pretty good when listening to music or watching videos from your phone. Maybe I’ll try a higher quality of headphones by TOZO.",3,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
"This product is a bomb for the price and quality!It has a very good sound. Just the right perfect bass for an earphone that will not damage your eardrums without compromising the quality. also, amazing noise cancellation. Bluetooth connection is wonderful, no lagging or any disconnection even if your walking around our place (60 sqm) with your phone just in one corner! very good battery life too and perfect with it’s very tiny powerbank container. will definitely purchase another one again ❤️",5,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"As someone who hates the hard plastic feel of AirPods, as well as having a relatively small ear canal, these earbuds were the perfect alternative. The sound quality is great, coupled with amazing sound cancellation amazing! The charging/battery life is pretty nice, the Bluetooth range smooth and uninterrupted for about 15~20 feet, and the case has that satisfying “snap” when it closes.All around, if you’re looking for nice pair of wireless earbuds, you can’t go wrong with these. Totally worth the slightly higher price compared to the other ones on Amazon.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,1

The fit is excellent and the ability to change volume, pause, reverse and forward without going to my phone has been a great feature.

Initial impressions are good. They buds are a bit slippery so I think in some situations they’ll be pretty hard to hold onto. Haven’t done a workout yet but right now they are a good fit and the music quality is clean and good.,5,1,2020-5-10,1,0,1
This was my first set of wireless headphones.  Initially I was a little hesitant as there are much more expensive ones available so I assumed these would be cheap or bad quality.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  They work great!  They were easy to set up and the sound is amazing.  Would definitely recommend.,5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0

"I must say I am extremely impressed - especially considering the price. Pairing is simple. Great selection of insert sizes. The instructions are easy to follow. They wirelessly charge!

"I've only owned the Soundpeats True Wireless earbuds and these, and so far these are my favorite of the two. The case is compact compared and overall feels solid, and the wireless charging feature is awesome at this price point. Battery life is also much better. They sound great too, more open than the Soundpeats. We'll see how long they stand up, but so far so good! I highly recommend them over much more expensive options if you just want something to throw around.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0

"Bought these for work to focus or make calls. I listen to podcasts and music mostly while working. The sound quality is pretty much what you expect for the price. A little thinner and maybe ""AM Radio-ish."" However they get the job done and hold a decent charge.",4,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0

"I've been using these for about 5 months now and I really like them. The sound quality is good, but I do wish they got a little louder. I've used them during workouts and walking and they stay put. On the superficial side, I got the pink set, and I love the color! My daughter had bought AirPods for $150, and I definitely think these are comparable, and with a $100 difference, they are a great value.",5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0

"Needing an all-around good set of earbuds, I took a chance on this set based on reviews and the sale price with a coupon.  The sound quality satisfies during day-to-day tasks and the wireless charging is something I wish was present in more expensive earbud models (like Amazon's own Alexa earpods).  Quality construction allows for solid fit in my ears, with a seal that provides good sound isolation.  For $50, this is a better set than many more-expensive models.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0

"Great sound quality and solid construction. I had to remove a star because honestly none of the 4 supplied ear plug sizes fit VERY well, and the best one has no chance of staying in during heavy sweating/strenuous workouts. For high intensity activity, I'd have to recommend a different model or maybe one with ear clips. In addition, any sweat that gets on the outer surface will wreak havoc on the touch controls, such as raising the volume over and over. Fine for light to moderate activity or if you aren't going to sweat a ton, though.",4,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0

"I just received these today and am very impressed thus far. I have a small ear canal so was afraid they would not stay put but I changed to the small ear piece and they don’t move a bit. The ear pieces hold really tight on the buds so be prepared to mess with it a bit to get them change but I didn’t mind it because that just means they won’t fall off on their own like others I have used. The sound is great, and very simple pairing. I’ll have to get used to the controls as they are sensitive but that will come with time using them.",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
I loved the headphone until I lost both in the house. They fall out quite often also. Sound is great. I just wasn't too fond of the automatic touch because it stopped my music a lot and turned the music volume all the way down...and i couldn't turn it back up because the other head phone turned the volume up & was missing.,4,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
I like they’re better than T10 -R. They fit in your ears better but there’s still chance for improvement. Sound quality was decent. I’ve had trouble in the beginning with volume adjustment. Either it’s too high or too low that you can’t hear sometimes but it could be a software bug with the app that I was using. It’s working good now.,4,1,2019-10-11,1,0,1

Less than two months later after moderate use (~20-30 times), the microphone has stopped working consistently, and when I try to have a call with  people they complain that the microphone quality is really choppy.Can still use for listening to music because audio is fine, but can no longer use it for meetings or calls which is a big negative.",1,1,2020-8-14,1,0,0

"I like that these charge wirelessly. They paired easily and were already charged out of the box. They sound great so far.

"As soon as you see the package to this, you will be blown away by the quality of this product. Not to mention, it's super easy to use. Pairing is quick and easy and the quality is fantastic.

Heck, I might anyway!!",5,1,2020-2-14,1,0,0
Earbuds were easy to pair right out of the box. Sound is good. I changed the ear caps to a different size and they fit in my ear without falling out and are comfortable. There are several sizes to choose from. A light tap on them controls pause or play. Volume can also be controlled from the earbud.,5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
These are so great! I use them on my runs and they don't budge...just make sure to insert them right...hole side down and then twist back to adjust in.

"This is my first time using a pair of wireless ear buds, so I wasn't sure how easy they would be to use or what the sound quality would be like. A quick look at the instructions, and off I went. Super easy to pair, and operate. The sound quality was better than I expected, and they were comfortable in my ears. They do come with several sizes of ear pads if the ones that come on it don't fit. Overall, I'm extremely happy with my purchase, and I would totally recommend them to anyone!",5,1,2020-2-12,1,0,0

"I literally just opened up my package, set up, and listened to a couple songs to test my new babies out. The set up was seamless and the earbuds connected to my iPhone in seconds. The sound is clear, loud, and cancels out the majority of the noise around me. The touch is super sensitive, which I will have to get used to, however I love the fact that they are waterproof, they fit comfortably, and the rose gold is gorgeous in person. I can’t wait to go for a run!",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
Great earbud design. More comfortable than others at 3-5x the cost. It is actually sweat proof as I use these in the gym or when I'm working on outdoor projects. No pairing issues and the sound quality is great. Well worth the cost!,5,1,2020-10-6,1,0,0
"Sound quality is okay, but volume is abysmal. I can’t really say much about noise cancellation as the volume is never loud enough to cut out surrounding sounds. They do feel great in my ears though. Also seems like case seems to continuously charge as if maybe a pod is holding charge.",3,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
"This earbuds are the best I've ever had! I'm glad they have the little silicone tips because they're much more comfortable than Airpods, Airpods always make my ears hurt after a while.

You can't beat the price either!",5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
"These are great Bluetooth earbuds. They sound great and are comfortable in the ear. My only complaint, as some others have stated, is the touch control on the earbuds can cause you to inadvertently tap one off. It just takes getting used to.",4,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0

"I'm a medical student and got these as a way to watch lectures at home without disturbing others in my apartment, and without having to deal with wires.

They feel sturdy in my ear and show no signs of falling out anytime soon. Definitely recommend to anyone wanting wireless earbuds that are affordable and made with excellent quality.",5,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0

"I wasn't sure how good the sound quality was going to be considering how inexpensive these earbuds are. I own a pair of Bose QC 35 headphones and although these earbuds don't deliver to the level of my Bose, they actually sound pretty good to make them a viable backup option in cases where I don't want to wear my more expensive headphones. I was honestly impressed by the wireless charging functionality as not even Apple's 1st generation airpods delivers this feature. If you're looking for something small, inexpensive, and easy to use. This is a great option.",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
I've only owned the earbuds for a week so have limited experience. I am pleased with the battery life. With the buds charge and their case I have not been caught without sound.

"First – The case is smaller, flatter, easier to carry around, very similar to air pod case, it’s definite noticeable compared to the previous, T10. I like the T10 sound, but there is a significant difference in sound quality. I listen to all types of music while at work, sounds clear but some hiphop songs does not sounds as good as others, it may be due to my phone settings. I am using the T6 in the gym and at the office and I have no complaint.

2 things.1 Test your ears with the different ear inserts. 2 let them break in a little. They sound great once they’re set up!! They connect fast enough and are responsive to touch commands(Sometimes more than I’d like but definitely usable). I’ve showered with them on and I can say they are actually water proof. I charge them weekly with medium use. Not paid for this review nor am I a professional reviewer. Good sound at less than premium price,5,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0
"Instructions could be a little bit better, registering it is a problem (probably because of the current pandemic). However, I am loving these earbuds! I've been contemplating on getting one, I'm glad I chose these.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0
I purchased these to swim with and they have great sound quality out of the water and are comfortable but they tend to come loose.  Trying the different ear buds to see if another works better.  I will be using a lightweight neck gator pulled up while I swim so I may listen to music or audible books!  I like the product. It charges quickly.,5,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0
I love this Tozo bluetooth earbuds.  The sound quality is very good and the battery life is good. I also like the fact that there's no wires running across my neck. I'm really happy with my purchase.,5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
The Tozo T6 is a must buy product. I have purchase the T10 and blame away by the premium feel and sound quality. The T6 turns it up and notch. It makes every good --BETTER! It has a really premium feel and the convient wireless charging case. Sound Quality is excellent and touch controls are easy to use. I was able to use the T6 in the rain without no issues during my way to work. This is a excellent product overall.,5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,1
"I can't say enough about how bad the sound on these is. There is zero midrange, head-bustingly harsh treble and a tiny bit of bass. Listening to these gave me a ""nails on the chalkboard"" feeling.Returned immediately.",1,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"Liked how easy it is to pair to my Iphone8, great sound and has many different size earpod inserts to ensure a great fitting. The only downside is that it doesn't always recognize it when I tap on the earpod to raise volume or take a call or pretty much any of the options. But eventually it'll work. Overall a great product at a good price vs the Apple Airpods...",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
Excellent sound quality. Stays in ear much better than I anticipated. Love that it comes with extra different size ear tips.Charging case has a very satisfying magnetic click to the lid as well as when you place the ear buds inside.,5,1,2019-10-24,1,0,0
"All I wanted from my earbuds, besides decent quality and battery life, was to be able to easily pause/play and rewind/forward a few seconds since I mostly use them to listen to podcasts. I got all of that plus the ability to use Google Assistant! Not bad when you consider that, at 50 bucks, they are priced at less than half that of the name brand contenders.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"I got these earbuds to exercise with and to wear while I am working and the kids are in the house. They are perfect for both!

I never owned a pair of wireless earbuds but these are better than I expe them to be. The rubber earplugs fit my ears perfectly.  The range on them aren't too bad either I was in my garage and phone in the bedroom and it worked like a champ.The ipx8 is the main reason why I got these and so far so good with them being dunked in water and worked perfectly afterwards.,5,1,2019-11-28,1,1,0

"For the price of these ear buds, they are worth it ($35 with the 20% coupon) !  Crisp sound quality, fits comfortably in the ear, waterproof, pairs automatically and effortlessly, ease of controls for volume, play/pause, ff/reverse, answer/ignore incoming call.  I used it on a phone call and listener had no problems hearing me.  Truly love the investment, making my hour walks in the morning much more enjoyable than when I had the hassle of the wired headset that came with my iPhone.",5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0

I knew the T10s where good as they were the the most popular wireless earbuds on Amazon. I decided to give the new T6s a shot. They are smaller then the T10s and have touch controls. I was worried about the touch controls and it took a little while to get use to the commands but once I learned them they work great. these are my first wireless earbuds and I'm happy that I got them. They're perfect for the gym I don't have to worry about a wire. 1/3rd of the price of airpods which my wife has and I'm really happy with these.,5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"When I bought these, I loved them. The music quality it pretty good, the optional ear bud attachment helps with sizing, and they’re very small and discreet which I love. After about three months or so, one of the earbuds stopped working. I could still use the buttons to change the volume and songs but no audio could be heard. Customer service was great, though. They offered suggestions first and eventually sent me a new pair free of charge. I haven’t had any issues with the second pair.",4,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0

"I really love these headphones! They're super comfortable in the ear (I've had difficulty finding comfy ones because I have inside ear piercings) and they come with a wide variety of ear sizes! battery life is also satisfactory. If you only listen with one ear piece in at a time, it can last you literally all day.",5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"I was really happy with these earbuds, as I was mainly looking for something that I could use for remote meetings for work, as well as something to listen to music with while running.  The mic quality is great, and they are light enough to not fall out while running.  My only issues are that the touch buttons are quite large and hard not to hit while adjusting, and I had a battery issue with one earbud, but they have great support and I am quite happy with the resolution.",4,1,2020-8-26,1,0,0
"I've been enjoying it so far but I have two major things to note that I think might be worth considering: 1. Other EM signals nearby can cause it to cut out unless you have your phone/device out and in your hand. Greater than a foot or two away and interference from cars and the like is a serious problem. 2. Setting the earbuds in the charger doesn't always turn them off, which can cause them to draw a lot of idle power. I've yet to figure out exactly what causes this but I've woken up to find the battery dead after it's been sitting on my desk doing nothing all night.",4,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"I bought both the nc9 for my daughter and T6 for me.  I am so far very happy packaging, instructions, and initial sound quality, although I haven't customized it all yet.  The touch buttons can be a little tough at first but like any technology will get easier quickly and are a great feature.  You can't beat the battery life, features, and warranty for such low cost earbuds...great value",5,1,2020-7-19,1,0,0
"Wow, they're actually really good earbuds at a very decent price! Whenever I have them on and playing music, I cannot hear any background noise whatsoever. I love the fact that they're waterproof so that I can use them while showering or working out. They also come with 4 different sized silicone pieces that you can swap out depending on your ear canal size. At first, it felt like they'd slip out, but after a while, you will notice that they actually fit super snug, so any physical activity you will do will NOT make them fall out. Highly reccomend!",5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"First wireless earbuds and these are great. Read a lot of good reviews about this so, I thought I give them a try and they've been great. Good sounds quality, not super deep bass, fits perfect in ears with specific size, provided. Roughly 6 hours on play time and small portable earbuds storage that charges your buds for24 hr of additional play time. perfect size for traveling can't even tell that it's in your pocket. For $50 it's def worth it.",5,1,2020-3-25,1,0,0
"Just opened the box a few minutes ago. The product paired very easily, and the sound quality is fantastic. It doesn't seem like the ear buds are going anywhere while I work out, but I'll update my review after I go to the gym if there are any problems. So far I'm a big fan!EDIT: The headphones mostly stay in place, but every once in awhile they need to be adjusted slightly, and I haven't figured out a way to do that without either accidentally pausing the song or moving back or forward a song. Taking one star off my review as a result.",4,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0

I only wish the volume would go higher, but I am getting old and it's probably my ears and not the buds!!The case is very slick, in both good and bad ways ;)  I think it could use a lanyard ring or leash or something to make it easier to hold on to, but I love the magnetized earbud holders and the charging is effortless.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
These wireless earbuds are extremely good for listening to music. It's so nice to not have wires get in the way while you work and listen. The earbuds are comfortable and should be waterproof (I haven;t tested them). These are extremely nice for comfort and relaxation. Don't put them in backwards though because you will get used to them to quickly and it will feel weird once you put them in correctly.,5,1,2020-2-19,1,0,0
"I like the product.  Good sound, nice size, small case.  The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is because when I use my wireless charging pad to charge the earbuds, the case get REALLY HOT!!!  This doesn't happen to anything else I charge on the same pad.",4,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0

"These are great headphones! Easy to use right out of the box. Not the most powerful (expected from earbuds), but the sound is very clear from lows to highs.

"Received this product in exchange for an honest review, I found the sound quality, which is the most important thing to me, to be excellent, with nice, rich bass and clear highs.

The sound is crystal clear and the connection is smooth. They also stay in my ear very securely, even when I'm moving around. My only complaint at all is that the buttons are pretty sensitive (to change music and etc) but that's literally it. You can't beat these headphones especially for the price!",5,1,2020-5-5,1,0,1

Worked reasonably the first time after charge .  Never would pair up after that.  Asked my adult daughter to try... major tech person....she said it simply didn’t work.  Too bad I had it for while before I tried it or I would have returned it.,1,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"I love that when I put these in one they fit my ears which is usually impossible(I have tiny ears) two the sound is crisp and clear and omg it’s like surround sound not like sound in each ear. I can’t even explain it properly but they are great. They pair immediately no hassle, if you want to just have one in that’s fine the sound is still great. I can’t say anything more than I love them.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
I read all the great comments and decided to make the splurge.  BIG MISTAKE. Let’s start with the volume. Max level is way too low. Next go to the bass - almost non existent. Next go to the pairing. If you like listening to your music on one ear no problem! Finally in case you were thinking of swimming with these that won’t work they disconnect immediately under water and the water acts like a button press. Save your money go with something else.,1,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0

While maybe Airpods are technically a better product as far as the bang for your buck I don’t see how anything can beat Tozo. They are great for running, exercise, etc. and can be used as your all in one earbud or they compliment the airpods nicely if you wish to use one for exercising and one for everything else.

They come with plenty of earpiece size options. They also appear to provide free gifts for leaving a review, so here I am.",5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
These are so good at drowning out my 3 year old. The battery lasts forever too. It says they're waterproof but I haven't tested that theory because I'd like to not get electrocuted in my ear canal. The only downside is the touch sensor is VERY sensitive. I'm always pausing my music by accident. Or turning on my music by accident.,5,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"Sound quality is great, looks pretty and fit is nice with different size options for the earbuds. Only low is the battery life but that isn't a low given the price. For $36 it's fantastic. Definitely go for it!",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,1
I’ve only just started using these but so far they have been excellent. Sound quality is good and I love the charging case and it’s wireless charging capability. Will update with a long term review soon.,5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
Just received these for my husband and son. They both are very pleased. Setup was super easy and they are extremely comfortable.  I plan to get a set for myself as well.,5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0
"Because the T6 has no left-right distinction, I was unable to get a good air seal in my ears, resulting in terrible bass response.  Apparently, many people do not have this issue.  But for me, the NC9, which has different units for the left and right ear, is far superior in terms of fit and bass response.  Both models have fantastic electronics and are masters of bluetooth connectivity.",3,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"At first I thought these were not going to work, then I changed the earbud cap until I found one that fit better in my ear.  It took me a few tries to figure it out since I was used to wearing the over the ear style.  Now I really like them and they stay in during spinning, biking and even running.",5,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
The sound is amazing.  Little perplexed as to which is identified as the right and left but I will get it.  The controls are extremely sensitive and it will take a minute for my gorilla fingers to adjust........but so far....AWESOME!!!,5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
Almost bought the T10s because reviews said they were loader and they're cheaper. These get plenty loud. Easy to use and comfortable. I would buy them again,5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"Simply amazing! These earbuds are better than I thought. Everything superb. Sound quality, fidelity, bass power, fit perfect in my ears, building materials, charging time. I almost bought a JBL 120TSW, after i try them I have completely disappointed. Tozo T6 e dar away better then JBL and other expensive bt earbuds in the market.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
These survived an accidental wash in the laundry and subsequent tumble dry. They still work exactly as they did before the wash with great sound and touch features. Very impressed and definitely recommend to others who have a history of bad luck with water and electronics!,5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
I really like these earbuds. The sound is great! I love that they connect to my phone as soon as I take them out of the case and disconnect as soon as I put them back in! I found out I was wearing them incorrectly when I watched the helpful video Tozo emailed to me. It made a huge difference in how secure they stayed in my ear!,5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"I've been using these earbuds for a few days now and they've been fantastic. They pair quickly, they maintain an excellent charge, and the sound quality is quite solid, especially for the price. I can't use the Apple earbuds because they are uncomfortable and fall out of my ears, but these have been fantastic.",5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"the sound is okay. however, these things are huge. not for me sadly because they keep falling our because they are heavy. pairing was super easy. wish they fit",3,1,2020-10-5,1,0,1

"A little too easy to hit the touch sensor while just adjusting the comfort of the earbuds. However, it is an excellent value for the cost. The earbuds are very comparable to Apple’s AirPod Pro and as an added bonus the case can be charged wirelessly.",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"Received these today and am really enjoying them.  Sound quality so far is good.  I've been listening to music+ making calls all day and haven't had any noticeable hiccups.  They are pretty comfortable too...so much so that at one point I forgot that I had them in.  For the price, I'm pretty content.  Will see in the future how waterproof these are and how the battery life holds up on these, but for now, so far so good.",5,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
These are my FAVORITE earbuds. I have very small ear canals so every single earbud I’ve ever bought always falls out. These stay on forever and I don’t even have to worry about wires. It’s also more than half the price of apple and works 10x better. If you read this review stop right now any buy these.,5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
These headphones are easy to use and have good sound quality. I run in them and never have a problem with them staying in. I like that you can have one in at a time and don't have to run with both.  So far I am happy with them.,5,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"Fast shipping! I received them today and can’t wait to try them out while I work out or while doing stuff where wired headphones are super inconvenient! They’re super light weight and I have ear piercings so I was curious to find out how comfortable they would be. To my surprise they came with 6 different size gel caps, so I’m thankful for that. I love the case and the pretty rose color they came in. I purchased the Added warranty and like that they promise a 24hr turnaround time for email responses for any issues.",5,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0

"I LOVE these things. They stay in my ears all day. I wear them all the time! The pairing function is one of my favorite functions; it’s so easy- once you set it up both (or just one of you if you don’t want to use two, which is what I do a lot) pair with the closest Bluetooth device. Usually that’s my phone. The battery life is around 4 hours, and the ear buds charge completely after 10 minutes. I highly recommend this product.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0
"at first i was super excited to use these as my other bluetooth headphones were starting to break and act out, and they were great for the first few days, but now, i can see why it was so cheap. the earbuds now only can take up to an hour of using them before they need to be recharged. im honestly so sad they ended up being worse than my old headphones bc i spent my money on this",2,1,2020-8-16,1,0,0
Great earbuds. I love the charging case and the sound quality is great. I usually use them for about an hour at a time while working out and they last all week before recharging. I also love the rose gold color. I would definitely buy again.,5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
So far I love them! I wanted a good quality headphone but air pods don’t fit in my ears. I love that these had a great price and came with many different sizes for ears! I can run and do jumping exercises with them.  We will see how they hold up over time! But can’t beat the price.,5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"Fantastic, the only thing to add is ear pieces are less about your ear and more about the tone and sound you prefer. Tested against$200 bluetooth 5.0 headphones and even my favorite over the ear headphones and although my one audio ear phones are my favorite these are fantastic.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"This is my first pair of wireless earbuds, but, they are really good. Good sound, but sometimes it lagged for me and the voice gets weird, but that's fixable (just connect and reconnect). And unfortunately it doesn't have a noise cancelling feature.",4,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
"These buds are impressive  for the price. You get all the  practical functions of a high end earbud. You can change change volume and songs by just touching the sides of the buds; noise cancellation works as it should be, its effectiveness would depend on what rubber ear piece you put on it. Overall, really good quality.",5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"They are way louder then previous models. Lighter, more compact. They don’t fall out of my ears when I run because they are so light!! 5 stars all day! You can not beat the price. I would buy 10 of these instead of one pair of beats headphones...",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"I love the quality of sound. Overall the product is great but, but the case that the buds go in for charging cracked. My girlfriends case is fine, but I don't understand how I have a crack in an item that basically sits on my end table. The charging still functions it's just a cosmetic issue with the plastic outer case on the lid.Again, the buds are great and feel like they are made of better quality plastics on the outer surfaces of them.",3,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0

I use when jogging.They stay on my ear really well. Not easy to end call on earbuds. But good enough for the price. I'm ok with them. Music sounds pretty good! I'm keeping them. Probably will purchase for my niece. I've had them a week. Update.  I have to send them back there is a lot of static during calls. No it's not my phone,4,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
Good purchase. Use these all day long for work/phone and continue to use for personal/ music and movies once the work day is over.  Definitely worth the money.,5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"These ear buds are definitely lighter weight/less durable than more expensive ones but for what they cost, they are a great product.  I like that you can fully control your music and phone through the ear buds and do not have to pull out your phone to adjust anything.  This was intended to be a secondary pair for me as I already have one pair, however, these will become the primary since my other pair cannot control volume through the buds.",5,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"Wow. I was literally amazed by just the packaging and looks of them. The boxing was very nice not that it matters but when someone takes that much pride in the packaging. Its a good sign. I havent used them yet but seem very nice. Very nice heavy duty strong magnetic charging/storing case. Earbuds are really sleek and stylish and seem to be built well, came with a charger cord which is always a nice touch. Very impressed so far. Also comes with an 18 momth warranty!",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0

Sound wise they are great(not quite as good as my Bose, but close--better then the other cheaper ones I bought too.), but the battery life is considerably better then the Bose. Therefore I end up using them more then my Bose SoundSport Free. Unlike some of the other brands in this price range, they are breeze to pair also.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
BUY THESE NOW. They’re phenomenal. I have tiny ears and these headphones come with the most size options of all headphones I’ve ever seen. The sound quality is great. They’re sleek and light. Easy to control. Work alone (one headphone) if needed. Can’t say enough good things. No issues at all so far. 10/10 recommend.,5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"Worked great for a while. 4 months later, my right earbud no longer makes any sound in spite of being on and syncing to the left. Left just says, ""secondary"" and the right never does anything other than turn on. I even tried updating the firmware and resetting the earbuds.",1,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0

"1st Pair of Wireless Earbuds.The sound quality is really good, loud & crisp. Distance is great with the Bluetooth, I'd say 25 PLUS feet (without measuring, guestamation). Battery is great. Goes loud, noise cancelling is good. Very comfortable, I use the largest size (3 sizes are included) pad & I can shake my head & do a variety of exercises with no issue of buds coming out. I've had them in my ear for several hours with NO discomfort. Very satisfied. Will recommend. Would definitely buy as a gift.",5,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0

"These are great little buds. My first pair of true wireless earbuds, and I’m thrilled with the sound quality and options for fitment.The only possible con I have against them is that the lowest volume is not as low as other earbuds, which would be nice since they are in-ears.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
The sound and battery life are the amazing. I've had other true wireless headphones and they don't even compare to the tozo. The pricing isn't bad either. I've recommend them to friends and family who were looking to buy headphones.,5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
I saw the many 5 star reviews and thought I would try them.  They were easy to pair and worked just as expected.  They come with many different ear bud options but fit out of the box for me.

I think these sound much better than other brands I have tried, so hoping they will continue to work properly.",5,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0
"Tried these earbuds for two days before deciding to return them. If you’re into quality bass, these do not live up. Treble was great, but I was missing out on a lot of the deeper sounds in music that I am use to hearing. I don’t know much about the engineering behind noise cancellation, but these block out most of the sound by way of the rubber ear piece fitting your ear more like an air tight ear plug.",2,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"The fit in the ear is awkward, causing them to fall out more than other wireless buds I have tried. Sound quality is good, and battery is solid.

You won’t be disappointed!,5,1,2020-9-29,1,0,0
Just got these today. My husband and 2 of my kids have Apple AirPods. They like them but they’re expensive and they’re uncomfortable in my small ears. So I thought I’d give these a try.

"These are awesome. The case is advertised for 10 hours of full use I believe, but I typically only use one earbud at a time so I can be aware of my surroundings. Meaning on a full charge I get about 20 hours of play time, which is super awesome. Also the touch sensing isn't just for your fingers, I can lean over and nudge it with my shoulder to pause if my hands are dirty from working outside.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0

Battery life is great. Water resistance is great too - I use these in the pool or rain all the time. Nothing to complain about!",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0

I have a hard time wearing ear buds Because I have really small ears. These earbuds came with many different sized options which was a nice bonus. The smallest fit our extremely comfortable and I’m super impressed with the sound quality and noise cancellation.

This is my first pair of wireless earbuds.  I use my phone all day and the buds battery life lasts 1-2 days.  People that I talk to say they can hear me clearly and I can hear them well too.  I like the 3 different ear plug sizes.  They seem to be well built.  I liked them so much that I got my son a pair for Christmas.

"The tozo t6 feels and sounds great. Comparison to the t10 earbuds, it sounds the same with bass and clear highs. However, the t6 is much lighter and easier on my ears when inserted. Its definitely water proof, because i accidentally drop the right side into a puddle of water and it was still working. The touch capabilities on them is a plus because u dont have to dig hard to push the button into your ears. And the calls where clear when talking.

I have had these for 6 months and can no longer use them. They smell like chemicals and have been irritating my inner ear.

Phone calls come in nice and clear and the other end has never complained about not being able to hear me, even in a noisy environment. All in all I love these headphones and would've paid double with no hesitation. Get yourself a pair!",5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,1
I really love these earbuds. I had the LG Tones and they were alright but I hate it when they would come off my ear. Especial  when I was working. These bad boys stay on even if I'm running.

I was sceptical about getting a bluetooth headset but several people at my work use them all the time and let me  borrow a pair. The next day I purchased these ones and was impressed by not only the sound quality but the range that they work at. I can leave my phone at my desk and walk almost anywhere in the warehouse without losing signal. These wireless earbuds are probably the best purchase I have made with out trying them out first. If you are looking to go wireless you dont need to look any further.,5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0

"Just got them, 1 day Prime delivery. So far sound great. Paired right out of the box to my phone. Charger box has a cover over the port which is grwat to keep junk from getting in there. Different size and type of earbud covers for convenience and comfort. I have always had a hard time with earbuds but once these are in just right, I can't even tell they are in my ear. Haven't tested the battery long enough yet but I'm sure it will work great for me.",5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,0
Got these in the gold but look more pink to me which is my favorite color. Very easy to pair and comes already charged up to 90% and had amazing sound. Very happy with these!,5,1,2020-3-16,1,0,0
I must admit that I was skeptical of these because of the price. I was wrong. After using them for a couple of months I find that they rival the air pods that I bought my wife for Christmas which cost 5x the price of the Tozo 6. The functionality is identical to the air pods and the sound is excellent. The Bluetooth range and battery life are incredible.  Highly recommend!,5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0
I write music and listen to my compositions on several sources. Large speakers. Small speakers. Headsets. Ear pieces. Transistor radios (yes). Different sources to hear as ordinary people would hear my stuff. I love the sound that this very reasonably priced set of ear buds produces. No need for a long drawn out comparison to others. I've bought two other similar sets and they pale in comparison. Just buy them and be happy..,5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"Out of the box: Sound quality is not good. Rustly treble and background noise. However for $40, not a bad air pod considering apple AirPods are $120. Worth the try to see if I lose them. 3 stars. Low quality sound but useful.",3,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
These TOZO T6 Wireless earbuds are the best earbuds I have ever owned. The sound that they put out is very clear and I love the bass that it puts out. It is very easy to pair with your phone or tablet straight out-of-the-box. NO SURPRISES! Thank you very much.,5,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0

I have a pair of AirPods and I decided to get these for my wife because she wanted a pair for herself but didn’t want to spend the money on AirPods. I used them and long story short if you’re debating on getting a pair of AirPods don’t waste your money buy four pairs of these for the same price and give three pairs to your friends this really makes AirPods look like trash all around in every way there better it makes you feel like you’re in an experience not just have headphones in.,5,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0
"While sound quality is amazing, I have to limit use to being at home. When I take them for my walks or runs, they turn off after 20 minutes. They simply disconnect, even when I am using them. Can't connect them again unless I am home by the dock. Crap.",2,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0

The earbuds were my favorite and worked great for a month or two. Then the started having issues keeping connected to my iPhone.

"After doing extensive research on what is the most affordable quality truly wireless earbuds I came across these Tozo T6's. I couldn't be more satisfied with the quality of both the product itself and the quality of the audio. I needed something a bit more portable too use around campus and these for the bill perfectly. Excellent quality, ease of use, and battery life are just a few of the many pros of these headphones.

Terrible quality, go for something else, preferably wired. Also left earbud died and does not charge anymore.",1,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0

You can't beat a product like this at this price point or possible even higher price ones. I had the AirPods prior to this (the original ones). The Tozo has a much deeper bass and better sound quality than the AirPods by far! I was truly impressed by the sound from these ear buds. The case is nice and small where I can slip it in my pocket just like the AirPods. And with the wireless charging that is such a nice feature. Great job Tozo!,5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0

For the price of this earbuds I'm pretty satisfy with this product.  Compare to the bose earbuds the sound is not as good but it is so much cheaper I think this is a better buy.  My bose only lasted exactly one year and it was dead.  One week after the warranty so i don't want to getting any expensive earbuds again.  So i try a cheaper product and it sound good enough for me so I'm satisfy with this product.  I like the size of this earbud over the bose and the touch control.,5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"I previously purchased a set of AirPods but they constantly fell out of my ears during walking. Figured I would give the Tozo T6 a shot as they were priced right.  Love them.

Had high hopes from the plethora of great reviews. Unfortunately these ear buds just don’t cut it when it comes to noise cancellation. On top of that the sound isn’t as crisp as I would like. The silicone ear tips don’t fit me at all and they keep falling out of my ears. I had to use skull candy silicone tips instead. Sometimes one of the ear buds randomly stops working too. I would invest in higher end earbuds.,3,1,2020-6-5,1,0,0

"Has pretty good sound quality, added with the fact that the noise cancellation with these things is super effective to the point that even the loud fans in the cooler I work in are almost nonexistent. The battery life lasts a pretty good while although more often than not I only use them in 1 or 2 hours sessions. I have used the battery almost to the limit before and I’d say they can go for about 6 hours before needing a charge. Definitely worth buying (even if I did get them on a bit of a discount).",5,1,2020-3-11,1,0,0

"The sound quality is fantastic! The touch controls are quite nice and easy to operate. The case itself has a nice weight to it--not in the sense of being heavy, but in the sense of feeling sturdy, yet still light enough to comfortably fit in your pocket.

"These sturdy earbuds are so easy to use, and have surprisingly great sound quality compared to even some of the more expensive name brands out there! I had been wanting a pair of truly wireless earbuds for a while that I could take to the gym our out dining and these 100% deliver. The battery life is most impressive, so it's nice to have even one less thing to worry about there. Even then, the case supports wireless charging so it's even more convenient.",5,1,2019-11-20,1,0,0
"I bought these thinking ""$40 is steep but they seem cool""...While the headphones are nice,  $40 turns into $50 because you have to buy an additional piece of equipment, the charging pad. They do not mention that on the product description, I don't think. Just FYI!",2,1,2020-9-18,1,1,0
"For the price you can beat these I got them with a 20% off coupon making them an even better deal. The sound quality is what you can expect from a bud style headphone. I use them for the gym mostly and they stay in your ears great, even while jump roping. The battery life from what I can tell is around the 5 hour mark that’s claimed. The distance from which you can leave your phone is a lot better than you would expect. I’ll never buy expensive ear buds again after using these.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
These were a gift from my husband. They allow me to move quickly and easily around the house without disruption of what I'm listening to or a call. They have an excellent range. They pair and connect quickly and easily no fuss. They don't disconnect unless turned off or with several rooms between them and the paired device. You can use one or both with no problem. They are comfortable for several hours and come with changeable earpieces for varying ear sizes/comfort preferences.,5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0

"I had tried another pair of wireless earbuds prior to ordering the Tozo T6 earbuds,  but they hurt my ears and didn't actually fit. After my return I read the reviews on the T6 and T10 earbuds and decided to spend the extra money on the T6.Worth every penny!!!! They are amazing,  they fit, they are comfortable,  the distance is amazing, sound quality is perfect.  I could go on and on of why these are the ones to buy.

"I have tried several other similar products with limited success or retuned. The T6, though, is the ticket. Boxing more professional and everything works well. Sound very good and ear fit great-particularly compared to AirPods.Noise cancellation isn’t up to par with my Bose, but for the $ understandable. Only minor downside is they are a little difficult to get out of case with my big fingers.",5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
Firstly id like to highlight how FAST i got these headphones i literally ordered them one day and the next day they were in my hand. From kentucky to new york in a flash!!

For 40 bucks i cant complain this is a great buy if youre trying to buy these!!,5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
I bought these headphones for my motorcycle and didnt want to spend $200 on an extra pair have (air pods but suck on a bike). These Do EXACTLY what i need them to do. A great buy! I brag about them all the time. Sound could be louder but still a wonderful product for $50!,5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0

"These are good headphones. They're comfortable, convenient, and they block outside sound very effectively. The bass is a little thin, but considering the price and the fact that they're wireless the sound quality is pretty impressive! If you're looking for something strictly for the sound you should probably just go for headphones, but if your priority is wireless, waterproof, compact, workout-friendly earbuds, then these are a great choice for the price.",4,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0

"Well, I had nothing but good news until tonight. The left earbud will no longer power on. These things sounded great had great functionality and were a good value.

My earbuds were working great for the first four months I had them. I didn’t use them excessively or even every day. After charging them one day I went to use them and all battery was gone. They will now not charge at all. I’ve both plugged them in directly to the wall and placed them on a wireless charger. The earbuds nor the case have any buttons so I cannot reset them. Other than this major problem this would have been a great product.,1,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0

"Very good sound, very good noise cancelling.  A very dope set of wireless earbuds for the $40 that I paid. However, the charging case broke after about a month of use. The right side of the case does not charge the right earbud anymore. Bluetooth connectivity also becomes an issue, as since the right ear bud does not think it is in the case since it is not charging, it attempts to connect to my phone at all times. Overall, very good pair of wireless earbuds, but I wish they did break so early, improvements on the case are needed.",2,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"For the price point, these do exactly what I hoped they would! Great battery life, great sound for the price point, well designed case and earbuds, overall very satisfied. If you're on the fence about these things, they're so cheap that they're worth testing out!",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0

"I got these on sale for cyber monday. I wanted earbuds I could easily walk around my workspace with. They proved to do just the job at an affordable price. The battery life on a single bud would last about 4-5 hours, and I put it back in to be charged another 3-4 times before having to charge the container. I wish it was usb-c at this point, because no one carries micro-usb around these days..Still, they cost way less than Galaxy buds and they get the job done.",4,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0

The reason for this is first, good quality for a reasonable price, and second, the design is beautiful. Third, the company's attitude towards the customer is really good. In fact, I don't know the quality of the music, so it doesn't make much difference whether I use expensive earphones or cheap earphones.

I highly recommend the Tozo T6 earbuds.  Yes, I'd buy them again.",5,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0

It works if all you want is headphones but the sound is horrible. They fit awkwardly and uncomfortably. For the price point I guess that’s expected. I would recommend saving for something a little more comfortable and with way better sound. Plus the little touch pads to turn them on can be sensitive and if you go to adjust it in your ear it’ll just power off.,3,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
"I wanted to try wireless earbuds for some time now without spending a whole lot. After searching and reading the great reviews on this product, my decision was made.

I recommend T6 earbuds not only for the quality of the product, but the quality of service.",5,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
Wow. These are great.  My wife had purchased the earlier version of these and I spent 10 more bucks and hit the newer version and they are great.A great investment.

Definitely a must purchase if you’re looking for a similar product to the Airpods.",5,1,2020-8-21,1,0,1
"Amazing product. I was a little skeptical about the price compared to Galaxy buds or Airpods, but the Tozos have blown me away. I am in awe at the sound quality and the ease of connectivity. As soon as I take them out of my case, they pair up with my phone. The quality is great given how small they are, and the case charges the buds as well. My only gripe would be the overresponsiveness of the touch controls. The sound often pauses even when I don't want it to at a light touch, but this is a minor issue.",5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,0
"They are okay. They never got quite as loud as I wanted and the battery is weak. Decent 40 dollar pair though. Lost the case unfortunately and they only sell a 20 dollar right charger, and a 20 dollar left charger. No way am I buying that, ill just buy a different pair.",3,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0

Comparing it to Apple's Airpods: the touch panel functions work better and allow the user to control more from the earbuds and not the phone. Also the case indicates how much charge is left in the case unlike airpods. The case has a magnet to lock in the earbuds so they don't just fall out. These earbuds are also waterproof and super easy to set up. One thing is that the earbuds are sometimes hard to get out of the case and should be an easy design fix.,5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0

I have always had problems with this style of in ear monitor as my ear canals are a little strange in shape or size.

"The sound quality and noise cancelling are good but one of the earbuds will not charge.  This after only 7 months of use.  I tested the good earbud in both charging ports in the case and it charges in both, so the charge case is not the issue.  The touch functions are also an issue.  The touch is extremely sensitive when it comes to initiating music play but rarely senses my touch to answer or disconnect a call.",2,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0

"I am really loving these earbuds! Shipping was fast! I ordered them on Friday night and received them Sunday. The setup was super simple, fast and easy! And I love that you can control them by simply tapping once or twice to play music or talk. So far so good, except for the Bluetooth disconnection that happens  every now and then.

There are plenty of companies making products of the same quality if not better for honest prices because their honest people. We get so caught up in the brand and price. Pricey doesn't always mean it's the best.  If you need a straight answer buy these they are well worth it.

Ear buds do exactly what the narrative says they will do.  Automatically sync when taken out of charger; long batter life; easy to move forward or reverse music; comers with 5 pair of different sized ear bud - more than others.,5,1,2020-7-3,1,1,0

"For the price, I can't complain much about these. They charge quickly, last a long time, and provide plenty of volume wherever I am. They have an excellent fit, and they come with 3 extra sets of ear pieces in case they don't fit right. The controls work fine, but I wish I could turn them off since sometimes I end up pausing my media when I'm adjusting them in my ears. In the end, they are high quality and we'll worth the cost compared to something like airpods.",4,1,2019-11-17,1,0,1

The quality is a bang for the buck. The deep bass on this works really well and is much better than the headsets in the same price range. It also fits really well and stays on the ear during workouts and runs. Unfortunately the right earbud stopped working after 6 months. On reaching out to the TOZO store they were happy to send me a replacement as it’s still under warranty. Would recommend this product for anyone looking for a good pair on a budget,5,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"I just recently purchased these earbuds, previously I had the Jabra 65t. These earbuds have the same audio quality or better than the 65t. They pair easier and fit in the ear better. A couple things there lack are the ability to connect to two devices at the same time but it was annoying with the Jabra's because switching between two devices was not easy and I ended up not using the feature. So far these are a great product and they are 1/3 the price.",5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0

"I bought these earbuds today and after about 10 minutes of listening to music, I was able to hear how good the sound quality was. Of course it’s not extremely high-end or top-notch sound quality, but it still has great sound, especially considering the price is only $50. To add on to that, the 3-year warranty is amazing too. I’ve never seen a warranty on earbuds last so long. I would definitely recommend these to people on a budget and looking for true wireless earbuds that sound good too.",5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"Good sound quality, easy to use with good set of features. The only slight negative taking it down to 4 stars is the way movement, such as walking, is noticeable in the earbuds. This sound is similar to the sound wired headphones make when the wire rubs against clothing when walking. It was very pronounced until I changed the earbud tips to a smaller size. Now it is noticeable, but not too bad.",4,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

I like the buds as they have good sound quality and fit snugly in my ears. But they are really touch sensitive. I have to make sure the Bluetooth on my phone is off when I put the buds in because my fingers run across the touch pads so much that it engages the voice command on my phone and I have mistakenly made FaceTime calls to random people in my contacts list. I may just need a little more time to learn how to handle them. But beware if you have big fingers.,4,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0

"Overall I am pleasantly surprised with these earbuds. I originally thought I would have to go through the painstaking hassle that is the return system. But when they say they don’t come off once inserted, they really mean it. I’m a person who sweats a lot; normally earbuds like this would pop out within 5 minutes of a workout; but these have stayed solid.

Great quality for the price. 2 negatives. The case doesn’t open far enough and it’s difficult for someone with large hands to get them out of the case. And the touch controls might be to sensitive. Adjusting the ear buds will pause or skip what your listening to.,5,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0

Connectivity was easy weather I wanted to use one piece or both. One tap and they were on. I’ve had the expensive stuff and this right here can compete. Just had for a few days but received on 60%. Day three and it’s at 39%. Survived Three 12 hour shifts with me and I haven’t needed to charge until now. Love!,5,1,2020-4-11,1,0,0
Earbuds fit ok but for anything longer than a hour it became uncomfortable. As far as the sound I’m not a big bass guy but these are really lacking. It sounds clear and can get loud but the sound as a whole was just not full enough for me. The battery life is great and I had no problems with connecting to my phone though.,3,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0
The sound quality is horrible. If enjoying your music is your priority then buy some over the ear bluetooth headphones like I did after this horrible disappointment.,1,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0

"Agree with all the other reviewers. Very good quality ear buds. I had a pair of ear buds before this that were comparable in price and design, and while the sound quality was good I'd have little reoccurring issues. The sound would time out if my phone was in my back pocket or bag, and the mic quality was poor enough where I stopped using it as a mic. However, I havnt had either of these issues with this pair of ear buds! I'm very happy with them so far.",5,1,2020-3-30,1,0,0
Love them!  So glad I purchased them. Was nervous about the purchase bc I didn’t know anyone who personally bought these. But now I’m going to brag about them to my friends and family. Not cheaply made and sounds awesome.,5,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0

Haven’t gotten a good chance to really test drive them for phone calls or workouts yet, but all in all I’m satisfied so far! I was curious if taking a risk and going for a less expensive option (to the AirPods) would be worth it - so far it is! Will update if things change.",5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0

"They're really good for the price, the batteries last me all day even if I left them on over night unlike other Bluetooth headphones that I've tried.

I’ve used the old model of the Tozos and loved them. I find that the Bluetooth signal is not as strong on these. Even holding my phone by my side or putting it in my pocket while walking interrupts the signal completely. I have to hold my phone in front of me to keep the signal going. These will be fine for the treadmill or working at my desk but I can’t enjoy them on runs or walks.,3,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0

The sound quality on these are very good.  I suffer from small ear canals therefore when I use the Apple ear phones they fall out.  I ran 3 miles in these and they didnt move at all.

Just got the product unboxed hooked up right away to test out and was very surprised with the bass they have. My biggest worry was will they be in sync with videos and they are.

These were my first pair of earbuds and I absolutley LOVE them! They don't fall out of my ears and they cancel all the noise. I wore them in the shower just to see how they did with the water. Not to bad--the left one slipped a little but I always have problems with buds staying in that ear. The touch is quite sensitive so when I go to adjust them I usually end up pausing the song. I would definitely buy these again.,5,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"Very easy setup and easy to control. The battery charging case is excellent. The fit in the ear is not what I expected. It sits very proud and looks like it would easily fall out.

"Sound is good, but not quite great. The touch controls are a nice feature, but they are sensitive which can be a slight inconvenience because they don't fit perfectly in my ear so when I need to adjust them I sometimes inadvertently skip or reverse my audio.

"They seem to get better sounding the more I use them, break-in period? Anyway I'm quite impressed with the sound and quality at this price. I'm having an minor operator error issue in that I keep hitting the controls, I'm guessing its just that I'm new to these kinds of earbuds. Sound quality on calls has been pretty good.... better than other wireless headsets I've had in the past.  100% recommend",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0

Just started using this product and am writing an initial review as part of the conditions of the free 1-year warranty. The only thing I can say is that it was super-easy to pair with my iPhone 6. I'll update review after I use the BT Earbuds for a week or so. So far so good.,5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0

Disconnects and reconnects sometimes but works and sounds good. Not so loud so i wont go deaf. Battery life is not as long as powerbeats but wroks well with a wireless charger.

For the price I highly recommend these headphones. Eventhough they're not name band they beat the top names. I'm a witness to this I purchased Bose wireless earbuds sports at almost 3 hundred dollars and I had a problem with the left earbud disconnecting all the time and Bose didn't help me.

First unboxing these ear buds have a nice solid feel.  The charging case seems nice too.  I initially thought the sound quality lacked bass but swapped out the ear cushions for a larger set (It comes with several sizes) and what a difference!  There’s plenty of bass now. The highs are crisp as well.  I like mine so much I bought another pair for my wife! Very impressed.,5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0

The features are nice but the sound quality is horrible. I can't get any bass out of these no matter what I do. My phone is adjusted to max and still it's barely noticable. The ad says these have deep bass which is why I bought them.  I have a $20 pair that sound way better.,2,1,2020-1-3,1,1,0

"These things rock! The buds stay in my ear even while moving my head around and running. They came with a lot of squishy earbud options (total of 6) so comfort is spot on. Noise cancellation is about 70% ish at half volume on my laptop.

I had held off purchasing ear buds because I did not want to spend $200 for them. I got the T6 first after ordering a couple of others. I was impressed with the sound quality but I was not sure about the fit. The others had a different fit but the sound quality was no where close. I finally changed the caps and the fit was great.  Now I got exactly what I wanted. An added bonus is the wireless charging.,4,1,2019-11-9,1,0,0
"I love these earbuds. Part of my job is doing lifting/stocking and its such an effortless task to just pop one in and touch the back to start my music or a podcast.

"Waterproofing is a joke. The volume control cant handle a small amount of water from a shower like they claim, however a sweaty Florida day they do fine.

Dissapointed in the waterproofing claim even if they arent damaged",3,1,2020-7-28,1,0,0
Comes with multiple ear bud sizes and in depth instructions on how to use all features. Very happy with purchase. Clear not overly emphasized bass leaving a clean natural sound from the music though if high bass is required these may be the exact fit for music preference.,5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0

These stick pretty far out of your ears, and to keep them stable you have to shove them pretty far into your ears, which is not that comfortable. Touch control mapping is a little weird.

Amazing product! Easy to connect and controls are simple. Great sound quality for the price and good noise cancellation.

"I have only had the earbuds for a few days but so far they are just what I need.  I use them mostly for audiobooks and the sound is clear.  Often , when walking, I get a phone call so the ability to take phone calls was important.  The bluetooth connection is good and I didn’t lose connection until I was across the house and one floor down.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0

"Excellent purchase. Well worth the price. Sounds quality is great. Charging is very fast (I think about 15 minutes). Phenomenal customer service.

So far i am loving these headphones. They have excellent noise cancelation for when i am at L.A. fitness. The battery life is perfect for my workouts. But most importantly the waterproof feature is the best. I sweat so much in my workouts but these waterproof headphones have been keeping up with me without the sound fading out from water damage. I highly recommend these.,5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"I just got these to use at the gym, and I'm impressed with how quickly they paired and the quality of the sound. Plus the touch features actually work well.

"Quick delivery and ridiculously easy to pair.  Came in the box fully charged and already in pairing mode! Great sound quality and excellent  fit. Super comfortable.  Only con so far is that the buds are a bit hard to remove from the charging case unless you have a small fingers. Also, i wish the charging case was USB Type C instead of Micro USB.",5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,1
These are the best headphones I have ever had.  I love that they are cordless! The sound quality is amazing.  They connect so easy with my cell phone. I love how small they are. They never fall out. Get these you will be happy.,5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
"Listening to music from a device two feet away, the sound was good, but it would cut out every 10-15 seconds. The clunk of losing the song and the signal was very uncomfortable to hear. I had to stop after listening for about 2 minutes. These were not going to work for me. The earbuds were comfortable, though I don't know how good they would've been in the long term.",1,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"I just got these today so I’m not sure how well the battery life is as of yet, they sound great wish they would be a bit louder but really good enough and I’ve never had noise cancellation so I really have nothing to compare them to but all in all they feel nice in my ear basically can’t tell they are even there.

"I am disappointed that I have to write this review; however it is my duty to give an honest assessment.  The case is small and easy to carry, it charges well and the magnetic strength is get.

Excellent earbuds. The touch activation is responding since and the sound is very clear. Phone calls are clear for both sides of the call whether you’re using one or both ear buds. The battery life is on par with others in this price range. The wireless charging case is a huge selling point along with the waterproof rating. Will be buying another pair for Christmas gifts,5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
Sound was good but these fell out of my ears constantly once I started sweating and bending over/jumping.If I tried to wipe sweat away from my face or move by hair behind my ears I would graze the earbud touch control and it would pause the music.,3,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0

"So far so good, paired fast and hasn’t dropped connection. They come with 6 different size rubber pieces to match your ear so working out without them falling out will be nice. If you get the rubber piece size right, it helps block out noise. I will be testing these on a plane this weekend to see how well they do with “noise canceling”. They do not look like AirPods but they are a great alternative, specially for the price.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0

I have both the T10 & T6 these earbuds are awesome they sound like much more expensive ones but Tozo buds are so affordable they fit perfectly and they give you a bunch of different sizes so you're bound to find one that fits the battery life is excellent and they came the next day after i ordered them stop reading all these 5 star reviews and order a pair!,5,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0

Honestly didn't expect them to be as comfortable as they are over long durations upon purchasing them given the price in comparison to any of the large brands versions.
