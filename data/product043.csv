"It's simple to use, charges very fast charging and isn't bulky. Make sure your PS4 controllers have the appropriate USB port at the base of the controller and not in the front of the controller otherwise it won't fit on the charging deck. Some controllers don't have the same set up as the stock PS4 controllers do re: USB and earphone ports. I know, I had to return one the other day and re-order the correct one for the deck.",5,1,2019-6-19,1,0,0
I was using usb cords to keep my controllers charged but this is a game changer. No more wires while I play. It charges a full charge in around 2 hours. It is small enough that it will sit on any shelf or table. I love the fact that when it is charged it turns itself off.  My one controller would not charge through a usb cable but with this item it will now charge up and hold the charge. You will not regret buying it.,5,1,2019-3-24,1,0,0
"Got this charger cuz the charging cables for my controllers were busted, and I thought it'd make sense to upgrade to a charger dock so there aren't cords everywhere.The charging dock is compact with an easy to understand and intuitive display. My controllers charged and work perfectly!",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"For too long I had an awful way of charging my controllers, and it discouraged me from playing PS4. Now I can comfortably charge both of my controllers so they are ready to go at all times. The price was awesome. The only complaint I can give is it didn't come with a USB cord. I can let that slide because I needed a really long cord anyways and would have had to rebuy the cord to fit the space I put it.",5,1,2019-5-20,1,0,0
"This product has been great so far. It charges my controllers quickly, the display is bright and it's very easy to determine whether they are charged or not. The only thing is that because the charger is very narrow, I feel like I have to be careful when placing the controllers on there. I have accidentally turned the PS4 back on before, and also dont want to mess up the port which sticks off of the base by not being careful.",5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"Its sort of difficult to get the controllers on the charging port, but once on it charges.  It is supposed to show the status of charging controllers, but mine seems to just show random green or red controller indicators.  Sometimes I will plug in a controller and the other indicator will turn red.  I am not sure what the issue is, but it is working otherwise.",4,1,2019-7-10,1,1,0
Let me start by saying I made sure my USB charger block was the correct corresponding voltage.I left my controller on this charger for about four hours. I went to pick up my controller and it was too hot to touch. The controller reeks of burned/melted plastic and had gotten so hot that it made cracking noises as it cooled down. My controller is broken. I'm beyond upset because I check reviews.,1,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
BEBONCOOL PS4 CONTROLLER DEUL SHOCK CONTROLLER CHARGING STATION has arrived & i have recieved it. The only reason why i have not used it yet to try it out....is because i have not yet bought one &/or 2 exstra playstation Deul Shock controllers to use it with & to test it with the Beboncool Ps4 Deul Shock controller charging station Yet! & that is all i can tell you! & yes Bebcool charging station is pluggable into the front of the Ps4 Pro!,5,1,2019-4-7,1,0,0

"So my first impression of this product was that it wasn't going to work, but it does.I ordered it as a Christmas gift and was somewhat disappointed by the packaging and then the fact the product was so light I wondered if it would even work, but it did!",5,1,2019-3-4,1,1,0
"So far, so good. We’ve been using this charger stand for months and had no problems at all. If I had to knitpick, it’s a little hard to place the controller in the back slot if there’s a controller still in front. But that’s so minor. And only because the controllers go in at a slight angle so it’s a little hard to line up without seeing. I still like the stand and like that it uses the bottom jack instead the top.",5,1,2019-6-10,1,0,0
"PS4 ChargerMy wife broke my last charger while trying to plug in the controller after play Sims 4. So I turned to handy Prime to find me a replacement hopefully she couldn’t break. Turns out this one is a lot better. It has multicolored lights, a fast charge, and an easy to use design. I have to admit I like this one a lot more than my last one.",5,1,2019-7-13,1,0,0
After setting up the charger and placing my controller on there for a brief period of time I tested it. The controller was extraordinarily hot to the touch. My controller would not turn on at all so I attempted to resync it to my ps4. Upon plugging in the controller I discovered that it still wasn't turning on. I am out of a $60 controller due to a poor quality unlicensed product.,1,1,2018-11-3,1,2,0
We have tried other chargers and this one is the best.  I like the fact that it uses the ports on the bottom of the controller instead of the smaller plug on the top like my older charger.  A little easier to place it in the charger.  The lights on the front are nice to see the charging status.  Plus it looks great sitting on our entertainment center.  I would buy again.,5,1,2017-10-16,1,3,0
"Bought this on a wim as one of those amazing deals, it’s actually really nice quality all around. Sturdy, expensive look, works great. No problems setting two controllers on which I’ve had with other dual chargers. Lights up to tell you that it’s contected correct. Definitely a nice purchase.",5,1,2018-3-18,1,3,1
"I like how you can fit two controllers in a small area and they are kept tidy, however I've gone through two units and neither work correctly.The first unit would only charge a controller in port #2. I've tried switching controllers in case there was an issue with the controller, but only port #2 would charge a controller.  Port #1 would remain lit (green light on face turned on), but would never switch to red to indicate charging like port #2 would.  The indicator light on the controller indicating the controller was charging wouldn't light up either when plugged into port #1. Tried replacing the USB cable that connects the charging station to no avail.",1,1,2019-1-8,1,1,0
I have purchased the product recently and it came quite fast and looked perfect. The product design was good and the way controllers sit on the product is very stable and I was really happy with the purchase but unfortunately after few days the charging port started to malfunction and I never actually moved the product it was straight out of box to the wall shelf. I was extremely disappointed and stopped using it since it wasn't charging anymore unless I  hold the charger cable upwards. AND THIS IS THE PART WHERE I BECAME HAPPY AGAIN.And just yesterday I received email about reviewing the product and I wrote almost exactly what I wrote above. And immediately after few minutes I received email from the company's customer service which he/she was concerned about my satisfaction and asked they can make me happy by replacing the product or full refund. And it actually made my day. From time to time I face crappy or defected products from amazon and never received contact back like this. They immediately shipped new product to my address and I am waiting for the non-defected one right now. I really liked the design of this product because the way controllers sit on it seems to be safe for the jack for long term usage and it really is if you purchase it and use it. The charging lights are so useful also. And since they replaced my defected product so fast with quality tested one I have nothing bad to say about this product. GREAT VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY PEOPLE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SELLER.,5,1,2018-9-17,1,2,0
"**edit**I wanted to give this a 5 star rating but all of a sudden the front charging port is defective and will not charge either of the controllers. The back one works great. Every time I pick up a dead controller off of the defective port I am irritated. The reason it is so irritating is because there is no response from the seller regarding this issue, AND NOW I see that this device is recommended by Amazon! Are you joking?? All these reviews stating the device is defective and you’re still recommending this product? I am a prime member, but this product broke just after the return deadline. BTW We purchased this June 2020. It’s July 2020. Do not purchase.",1,1,2020-7-13,1,8,1
"I wanted to wait until I have used this product for a sufficient amount of time before writing a review. Some products may seem very good at first but will tear up soon after. However, that was not the case with this product. I have been using it for quite some time now, and I have had no issues with it at all. It charges my controllers very quickly and efficiently, and does not over charge when i leave them plugged in. One thing that could be better is if it came with a wall plug instead of a USB only. Also, thing looks pretty sleek sitting next to my PlayStation.",5,1,2019-7-14,1,1,0
"I kind of wasn't expecting to have to buy a charger for a controller. The last PS I had was the PS2. There I was playing KH3 when I saw the message ""low battery"". Silly me! I thought it needed a physical battery.  Plugged into my PC without a problem. So far I've charged the controller once and its lasted days.  That's longer than my phone holds a charge. So I was happy with the charger. It arrived in a couple of days and I didn't have to wait long to tune into the magnificent journeys and adventures of Sora, Donald, and Goofy!",5,1,2019-2-11,1,1,0
"I was terrified by kids would stand on the perpetually dangling USB cords attached to our PS4 and it would wind up being yanked off the TV stand.  This little gizmo resolves that, tidied up the ugly cords and now lives next to our couch so I can avoid the 24 steps of exercise I need to take to switch controllers.  We really like it.  The kids struggle to get the controllers attached sometimes but overall we couldn't be (much) happier.",5,1,2018-9-7,1,2,0
This very well may be the best thing I've purchased in a long time. Plugs right into your PS4 or power brick (not included) and works just like it says! Also has some nice rubber grips on the bottom of it to keep it from sliding off of a table or whatever it sits on. Lights on the front of the charger tell you when your controller is fully charged. It even shows you a status on how charged the controller(s) is!,5,1,2017-11-8,1,2,0
"I read all the great reviews.  Have had mine two weeks and it won't charge anything.  Checked the cord, even bought a new USB for it, didn't fix it.  Even a dead controller, shows green that it's fully charged.  It's such a pain to return such a low ticket item so will just toss and try a different one I guess.  I've never really had a defective product except once in 10 years here so I'm very disappointed.",1,1,2019-4-29,1,6,0
I bought this and a new controller. Charged the new controller on it and it will no longer sync or stay on. Do not buy. Just use the cord to charge your controllerUPDATE: If this happens I found a solution to fix it. Take the dock set the controller in the dock while the dock is plugged it. Take the charging cable plug it into the PS4 and while the controller is setting in the charging dock plug the charging cable into it as well so that you’ve got two different sources of charge and then the controller will automatically sync and turn on with the PS4.

"My young kids jacked up the micro USB charging ports on the front of the controllers. This charging station was a life saver. The charging ports are much more durable, easier for them to seat to charge, and has the red/green indicator for charging. This was an excellent investment from keeping me having to go buy new PS4 controllers due to the micro USB ports breaking. I highly recommend this above using the standard charging ports.",5,1,2018-12-15,1,1,0
"The lights only show green, even when you plug a completely dead controller in it. One that had been on the dock for a week. We rarely use our PS4 so I didn’t realize it wasn’t working until outside the return window. I should have gone with my first instinct that it wasn’t operator error.",1,1,2019-10-23,1,1,0
I bought this for my teenager son to keep his 2 controllers charged.In the past I've lost over 4 controllers because the batteries went dead and my kids were too lazy to keep them charged. Not any longer!,5,1,2018-6-11,1,2,0
I bought this for my kids to go with their new PS4 they got for Christmas.  Right out of the box the lights didn’t work according instructions.  After putting both BRAND NEW controllers on the charger the controllers no longer worked.  They wouldn’t turn on at all.  My children were upset not to be able to use their Christmas present.  Major disappointment!!!!!  Thanks to this crap product I now have to spend $100 on new controllers!!!  Do not waste your money on this product!,1,1,2019-1-7,1,1,0
"This works exactly as I had hoped it would. The last charging cord got destroyed when the robot vacuum ran it over, so I opted for something that would charge both controllers at the same time, so we could alternate. Bonus, that the lights indicate when the controller is charged. Side note, I have a toddler who likes to play with the controllers, and has actually dropped the charging station (on the second day we had this) and caused something to come loose, but it still works.",5,1,2019-5-5,1,1,1
"I revived a ""DOBE"" brand charger. Which I guess isn't that bad but I picked this one specifically because it didn't have an obnoxious brand label across the front. I don't see the point in wasting my electricity on the led lights that are used to illuminate some generic brand name. Besides that, there are no 1 and 2 distinctions between the controllers as shown in the pictures and the indicators are backward. Meaning when I plug the controller into the rear charger the front light is what is used to indicate whether it's charging or not. But on the bright side, it seems to be charging the controller. I only have one at the moment so I can't really speak to its ability to charge both at the same time yet. I like that it charges through the bottom usb port instead of the top. Other charging stations have you setting the controller on upside down which looks really stupid. So if the product was actually what the pics and description show I would be very happy with it. But getting something different than what you expected is a little disappointing. Update: I had them replace the item thinking maybe it was just the I got. Plus one of the chargers stoped working. But when I got the new one it was the same as the first one. Charging indicators are backwards and it just looks different than the picture. I’ll add a picture of the front controller charging.",3,1,2019-1-20,1,5,1
"This product does not look like much when compared to the other chargers out there, however; I ordered one and it works great.  Here are the cool features.  You do not have to plug it into your PS4, you can plug it into any other USB charger and this way you do not have to have the controllers next to the PS4.  The status of GREEN and RED are great to know if your controller is ready to go, and also once your controller is fully charged, you do not have to worry about overcharging.  Very compact and barely noticeable on display.",5,1,2018-2-12,1,1,1
"This charger comes with instructions only electronics technicians will likely be able to use.  You will need to purchase a separate 2A 5v USB charger for this device, commonly included with many mobile phones and other USB powered devices.  It might work with your PS4, but those ports are not designed to provide enough power.  It won't hurt your PS4, but it also may not work.The charge port to connect to your controller is built to support SONY controllers only, as they have used a plastic peg to rest the weight of the controller on the audio jack, along with USB micro connector.  This is a hard no for people using PC versions of the PS4 controller, unless it is a cloned version with the audio jack and USB port right next to each other in the same orientation.",2,1,2020-2-2,1,2,0
"This is a great charger, it charges the PS4 controllers through the mic input at the bottom of the controller instead of the USB port at the top. This is useful for controllers that have gone dead and cannot be recharged, which is the reason I bought this in the first place. I was able to revive a dead controller that I had otherwise given up on. The only thing I did not like about it was that its power cord is a simple USB plugin rather than a real power adapter that goes into a wall socket. I was expecting it to plug into a power outlet so that I wouldn't have to charge my controllers from my PS4. However, a convenient workaround for this is to get a power adapter for USBs that plug into a wall socket. So instead of charging my controllers through my PS4 or PC, I can plug the USB end of the charger into a power adapter that plugs into the wall. I would definitely recommend this charger.",4,1,2017-9-27,1,4,0
UpdateGreat customer service from the company. Quick responses and they are willing to do whatever is necessary to fix production. That's enough for me.,5,1,2018-10-16,1,9,1

"Got this as a present from my gf and let me just tell u she hit a nail on the head. Its sleek, looks very well made, the indicator is awesome, installing the controller to charge is easy and dont have to fight it like other chargers. also very compact, saves space on my small desk. very glad she got me this because i would of went with something more expensive, stupid me because this little guy handles its job extremely well. do recommend it",5,1,2018-10-30,1,8,0
So much better than a cable. And it looks cool. Apparently dimming the lights on your controller will make the battery last alot longer.  But I dont have that problem Because I'm  to busy with life to play that long.  Life ain't about video games.  Go out and do something,5,1,2018-10-25,1,8,0
I purchased this 4 months ago and it works great to charge my controller's. It charges from the front of the controller and doesn't use the micro USB on the back. The main problem I run into with these types of chargers is it tends to break the micro USB but because you're using the port on the front it works allot better-putting the controllers into the base station.,5,1,2018-10-24,1,5,0
"Not only does this dock work awesome, it’s looks pretty cool next to my PS4! It is very convenient and it is an accessory that I have been missing out on. I really love that it charges using the bottom headphone ext port, rather than struggling to use the micro USB port at the top. I highly recommend this dual charging dock for those looking for a sleek looking space saver!",5,1,2018-2-27,1,6,1
Brilliant little gadget for a great price and does the job!  Before my kids were hooking their remote control up to the actual PS4 which meant they were really close to the TV but now having this little gadget life is so much easier.  It didn't come with the actual plug but it did come with the cable so I used a plug I already had and have it plugged into the wall so the remotes can charge 24/7.  I would highly recommend this as it's small and takes up no space.,5,1,2018-7-9,1,5,0
"I bought this for my DualShock 4 controllers that are connected via Bluetooth to my Steam PC rig. For some reason, I have inconsistent results when attempting to charge them via microUSB cable, so I found I was having to keep them connected to a cable in order to use them. That is, until I found this handy charging station! Controllers can now charge in a reasonable amount of time (I'm usually never in a hurry and tend to rotate controllers). No more empty batteries!",5,1,2018-6-15,1,4,0
This almost caused a fire. Owned for 6 months without issues. Worked very well UNTIL it melted. My kids smelled something  burning in the basement. We found the micro usb charger melting at the point of connection to the device. Could have caused a serious fire. Recommend AGAINST buying this product.,1,1,2018-12-30,1,4,0
"When you set the controllers on the charger you  have to wiggle and fight to get them connected. Sometimes the charger  shows green lights meaning the controllers are charged, but they actually are not.  Very disappointed, will be looking for a better charger.",1,1,2019-12-13,1,1,0
"So first, let me tell you, I am not a gamer, but every member of my family is and I bought each of my kids and my husband one of these for Christmas. They have all loved them so far. The controllers stay charged and ready to be swapped out when they are doing long hours of online gaming. They haven't had any complaints about how they work and have been quite happy with how little room it takes up and how will it charges the controllers. I am happy that I don't need to trip over the cords that are no longer attached to the console trying to charge the controller while still playing..... just saying.",5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"At first, it seemed like the perfect solution for charging my two controllers are once. And it worked as expected. Battery life was about the same as when I used a regular wall charger from what I could tell.But now it's about 2 months later and one of the ports stopped charging completely. Can't say I will buy this same product again.",2,1,2019-6-23,1,2,0
"My husband and I use our remote all day. Before we bought this product we'd have to wait for the remotes to charge and be left high and dry in the middle of a gaming session or a TV binge. As well, you had to leave the PS4 on all the time to charge the remote. But now we always have a fully charged remote even if the PS4 is off. Easy and simple to use. Installation is idiot proof. Even my mom (bless her heart!) can put the remote on the charger without confusion or struggle--and she just learned how to turn on a laptop a year ago. Highly recommended.",5,1,2019-3-20,1,0,0
"I like the product, nice handy place to keep my controllers when i am not using them too. Only problem is that i feel they have decreased my battery life on my controllers which is a problem but i always have another controller charged and ready to go. I just do not like knowing they have a shorter battery life cause of it. But beats the hell out of plugging a usb cable. Only major players should purchase this.",4,1,2019-5-29,1,2,0
"Ever since controllers went wireless, I had to have a charging dock like this. This is the most recent one for the current Playstation.  They get better every generation. This one's pretty good.  The controllers aren't a big hassle to situate.  They sit neatly.  The charging notification lights work, but are reversed for which controller is charging. which isn't major.  It's better than unsightly cables.",5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
I really like this thing but apparently it doesn’t want to charge the controllers. We have tried it for 2 days now and thee controllers don’t want to charge.

This is a great buy for the price. I use to have one that stood up and used the micro usb in the back to charge but not with this one. You use the front plug in to charge and its much more sturdy in my opinion by plugging it in the front. The controllers fit well in the cradle and the way it lights up in the front to let you know that it is charging. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a charging stations.Pros:,5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"**update 4/22/19**The company sent me a replacement after the first failure. The replacement is corrected with the controller placement and both ports do charge, though touchy.

"I am not real sure about this charger.  The USB Charger card is SHORT, really short if you are wanting to leave them by the TV, an extra foot would have been great, I had to dig a cord out of the spare wire box.  Its tricky putting the controllers on there.  My husband has a VR storage rack in the other room and they clip right into that one., but this one takes effort.  I clipped both controllers into it and it showed Green lights right away, and I am pretty sure one wasn't fully charged.  My assessment:  Its just OK, and its cheap. If it gets a red light when charging and gives a good battery life, I'll come back and give it another star.",3,1,2019-11-27,1,2,0
"I bought this and I don't have any real misgivings about buying it.  It works and one of it's features I really like is that when you plug in a dead controller it shows a red light to indicate which controller is presently charging.  I like that.  What is a constant annoyance is when I have to plug it in it's a bit of a ""lets jiggle the controller until it actually sits on the charging plug correctly"" dance.  A minor inconvenience, but still annoying.  They could have done a better design job to ensure a more seamless transition for charging.  This thing is sturdy, has some decent weight to it, doesn't move all over and I really like the light indicators which stay on.  I'd buy again for a cheap price.",5,1,2020-9-9,1,1,0
"I love this product and want to recommend it to all buyers out there because it is really well made and great quality, unlike some other controller chargers available. I always know that my controller is at 100 percent when I get it to start my gaming. I love that. The design is durable, but it takes getting used to. Although the controllers slide on as they should, it took a long time to get used to how to angle the controller exactly right in the dark for it to slide on. When we first got the charger, it took some aggravation to get the controllers on it. But once you get used to it, it's no longer an issue. So I feel like the design is super durable and reliable. It's good quality. But, on the other hand, it seems to me that the design needs to be perfected so that it is easier to slide the controllers on there while still being durable. But, overall, because of the high quality and reliability, I highly recommend this charger over others on the market.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,0,0

I'm not sure if I have a defective one or not, but this unit charges the controllers and even though it says they're fully charged, they're not. He takes them off to use them and within about 15 minutes, they're dead. I am not a gamer but I'm pretty sure a fully charged controller should last longer than that.",2,1,2019-1-24,1,1,0

"So far so good. Super easy to plug in and it’s functional for even a child to take it right out the box and connect it. The chargers I normally buy my son eventually break away from the port and I find myself buying quite a few charges. So when I saw this I decided to give it a try. It’s perfect, he can charge a couple at a time and he’s not constantly pulling at the wire while it’s charging. Normally he plays with the remote as it’s charging, but now with a double charger as he’s playing the other one is charging. Love it",5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,1
never have a dead controller again. hang any Sony controller for PS pro ps4 slim or PS 4 on this charging base. be sure you have the charging ports in the middle of the controller in between the two thumb sticks will be a slot and a hole to the right which holds the controller in the charger. the chargers display will light up  red while charging then change green when fully charged.its been my experience that only official Sony PS 4 controllers have these ports some after market controllers do not have these ports. if your controller doesn't have these ports to hang it on this charging station do not by this charging station it will not work.,4,1,2020-5-28,1,1,0
"This charger is absolutely great.  I had held off on one of these forever because I always just plug the controller into the cord coming from the system while playing.  Won't get a dead battery that way.  But, recently I've been taking notice of how I dislike always having gaming cords on the floor, or, having to remember to unhook them and put them away every time I finished playing.  This is a cheap charger.  It isnt particularly fast, but since I have a 2nd controller, even if the one I'm using runs out of juice I have no worries.  It's been nicer than I realized to not have to deal with always plugging in the charging cord when I want to play video games, so I most definitely recommend this.",5,1,2020-4-8,1,0,0

Don’t hesitate just buy it especially for the price !!",5,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
Great product so far and works as described.I had a nyko controller charger before this that used both usb ports on the ps4 and only had usb 2.0 pass through ports.  So I had to stop using it when I added an external hard drive for games.,5,1,2019-7-3,1,1,0
I bought two of these for my four controllers.They've worked great for about 6 months then one of them started going bad.,3,1,2019-1-20,1,1,0
"Product arrived on time. Does not include a plug in for wall outlet, just a USB cord, which is disappointing since devices like these should always come with one. Charging indicating lights are simple but one issue I've had on initial use is the lights keep switching back and forth between red and green. The instructions are so brief and basic it does not indicate what this means and I can't tell if its actually charging, having an issue, or fully charged. I only just set this up so an update on my review might come later.Overall the product seems simple, easy to set up, and works, but lacks a wall plugin, instruction manual is so brief and basic when issues come up they are useless.",4,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"The product worked great at first. It was very easy to use and more convenient than plugging the controllers using two separated mini USB cables. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 7 months and now it does not longer charge the controllers.",1,1,2018-7-21,1,8,0
"I was tired of charging my controllers with my PlayStation 4 USB slots and having no spare USB slot for my wireless headphone adapter. This eliminated that problem. I just bought it recently so will update if there's any issues. It was simple to use and set up. Keep in mind the cord is not very long, luckily for me I had a spare one that was long enough to reach an outlet with a phone charger box (if you are going to plug it in on the wall mount instead of directly to the game system USB slot). IF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE HAHA.07/27/2020: Update, both of my controllers are acting like they are possessed when I play. It won't let me move my character around the direction i want... now i am constantly fighting with my controller. THIS NEVER HAPPENED until I started to use this charger. I wish I could send it back. Now, I have to probably buy a new controller.",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"Unfortunately only one of the two charging ports working. I've tried swapping the controllers around and swapped power cables, but no luck. The lights both work, but the second charging port doesn't charge, and the light just stays red.  How frustrating!",1,1,2019-1-11,1,5,0
"I liked the product, until it conveniently died just a couple of weeks after the return window. As you can see in the pic, there’s no lights at all on on the charger - it’s supposed to have a red and green light. I unplugged, replugged, nothing. Cheapness I can handle, something breaking after a little over a month is not acceptable. Don’t buy this product",1,1,2019-7-20,1,2,1
Says both controllers are fully charged when I know for a fact they are not. Had both controllers on for over 3 hours and nothing. Tried different plugs and wires but still doesn’t work. Keeps lighting up Green but my controllers won’t turn on. Seemed too good to be true. Don’t waste your time or money.,1,1,2019-3-26,1,2,0
"This product works just OK for me. The connections that are supposed to power the charging don't consistently work.  They are supposed to turn RED when charging and GREEN when charged. There are times that the rear connection doesn't work without some major jiggling. But since I typically don't charge 2 controllers simultaneously I don't have to mess with the back dock, and the front one works much better.",3,1,2019-5-31,1,1,0
"First charging station I've ever purchased that doesn't come with its own wall plug.  Basically says ""use your own adapter..."".  (you only get a REALLY short usb cord)  If you are like me, and want to charge the controllers further away from where all of your components are, this is not the charger for you, unless you want to pay another $10 for a wall charger or use one from your phone.",2,1,2019-9-8,1,1,0
Waste of money. The only benefit that I got from this item was the cable it does not work when you connect the cable to the item so we can charge the controls the controls will not charge with this it does not work I thought that the first time that I purchased this in December my kids broke it the second time I bought it I realized that it was a piece of trash it’s all pretty from the outside but it does not work it looks nice but it doesn’t work I completely regret purchasing this.,1,1,2020-9-28,1,0,0
"The connection where they plug in are a little tight, it did not work for one of my controllers but probably because a kid shoved some stuff (probably gum) in the charging spot. Good product though.",4,1,2020-1-17,1,2,0
"For just over twelve bucks, this thing does exactly what I wanted it to do.Previously, I had always had a USB charging cord awkwardly draped from the front of my system to one of the controllers I haphazardly tossed on top.  The great thing about this device, for me, was just that it made it easy to run a cord BEHIND my entertainment system and into a wall socket and created a perfectly organized place to store my controllers. It charges both controllers too, and the light-up-display is neat and all, but since they now rest in this dock when not in use, I feel like they will NEVER be low on battery.",4,1,2020-10-1,1,0,1
"I bought two of these and one of them is great. The second one is no longer working. I noticed about 2 weeks ago that it was doing this weird flashing thing. I tried to reach out on amazon and for some reason it said that the entire item/page was no longer available. I just went to  look again, and here I am. I wish I could contact the seller but I can't find a way to. When these work, they're fantastic. The charging screens are very well done, bright and  have a sharp image.  I think that our defective one is just a dud. But still, I'm stuck with an non-functioning product.",2,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"Good to keep controllers charged and ready to use. My only complaint is that it only charges them up to 75% and stops (stated in the description). I love that it stops charging to prevent overcharging, but I wish it would stop at 80-90% of battery life. Also, the colors on the charger are a good feature to show if the controllers are charging or not.",4,1,2020-3-12,1,1,0
"This is kind of pointless without a 120v adapter. If you have to use the PS4 power to charge the controller then that defeats the purpose of a wireless controller, I might as well plug in the charging cable for the controller. Unless your ps4 is constantly on (which it won't be as it auto turns off) I wouldn't buy. Would be a great product had they provided 120v adapter.",3,1,2019-4-17,1,1,0
"Does good for charging and storing you controllers. Can be a little difficult to get them plugged in using the bottom ports. There aren't really any guides to getting the controller in the right angle to plug it in.  Also if you have any controller accessories, you will have to remove them before charging each time.",4,1,2020-2-17,1,1,0
"I had been meaning to buy a charging stand for a while now and now that this has arrived I'm wondering why I took so long to make the decision! The stand is nice, sturdy, and charges like the PS4. It helps that I can plug the stand cord into a usb outlet so now my PS4 usb ports are free. The light does stay red until the controller hits 100% according to the indicator on my PS4.",5,1,2019-8-12,1,0,0
"We thought we had 2 controllers that would no longer take a charge. (A $100 problem). We replaced he cables and still no dice. We bought this charger and it turns out it was the warbled-out jacks at the top of the controller. Plugged them in via the bottom jack and wah-lah! Keep them on there now and they are always ready. Love the 2 PS4-shaped red and green colored lights, indicating which controller is charged and which on is not. Great design, maybe the kids won’t destroy this in 10 minutes.",5,1,2019-7-17,1,0,0
"My kids love playing games on their PS4, but they were terrible at putting the controllers away.  Not only does this keep the controllers organized but it charges them as well.  I'll admit that I was hesitant to purchase this as I didn't think it would work.  I was wrong! Not only does it charge both at the same time, but it charges it quickly.When the lights are green it means the controllers are fully charged.  If it is still charging then the color will be red.",5,1,2019-10-16,1,0,1
"This is a great charger -- Main thing to know about it is probably that seating your controller on there is smooth and easy.  I've had ones that were a bit fiddly in the past with the connectors, but this one works perfectly and the controllers are guided by the design right to their target.  Excellent.  I need to check if they make something similar for my Move Controllers, now!  :D",5,1,2019-5-1,1,0,0
"My kiddos got excited about a game they are playing and pulled the charger from its port as it was connected to the controller at the time. And it broke.We jump online and found one of reasonable pricing yet charged wirelessly. We found the Benboncool because it is cool. My 8 yr old hooked it up and was playing in 15 minutes. When he said mom it’s charged, I couldn’t believe. My kids are home due to the COVID-19 and I need things to work fast!!!!! Best Buy ever. Now I need to buy one more controller so I can play!",5,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"I bought this product five months ago and it’s been great. It’s only been in two places the entire time I’ve had it and hasn’t been moved or wiggled around but for some reason the cord has stopped working well. I have to move the cord around to get it to charge and the second I let go of it, it turns back off which is leaving my controllers only getting charged to one bar.",3,1,2019-11-11,1,1,0
"Unless I am completely confused, the ""BEBONCOOL PS4 Controller Charger, Controller USB Charging Station Dock"" is NOT compatible with the ""PlayStationPS4 Controller ORDA Wireless Gamepad for Playstation 4/Pro/Slim/PC and Laptop"".The charging dock has a plastic peg adjacent to the charging connection and there is NOT an equivalent  hole in the ORDA controler for the peg to fit into.",1,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"I've only had it for a month in July of 2020, so I have no idea how well it will last in the year(s) ahead, but this has solved the issue of my children plugging in and unplugging controllers without damage.  The guidepost that fits in the 3.5mm jack makes sure the charging port is lined up everytime.  Without a doubt, I'll be purchasing a similar product for PS5.",4,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
These definitely are cheap and very light they don't hold a charge for very long they randomly lose their connection to the PlayStation. 1 PlayStation controller fully charged last longer than both of these together fully charged but if you just want some friends to come over and play for a little while and have an extra controller they're a good deal,3,1,2020-10-2,1,0,0
"This device works as advertised, it looks sleek and removes burden from charging controllers. I have my gaming setup all at my desk, this device was a nice addition. I have two controllers that i virtually always keep on this dock and I have had ZERO issues. The devices charge relatively quick. I would recommend to any and all who are looking for a device like this, its a great deal for the low price!",5,1,2019-6-13,1,0,0
Works great! My youngest has an issue with smashing the charging cord in upside down and I'm terrified that he is going to wreck the charging port on the controller. With this I no longer have to worry. It charges quickly and it's as simple as laying the controller down on the port. Perfect for younger kiddos. Good buy for a really great price.,5,1,2019-11-19,1,1,0
"This docking stand is so freaking cool. Super simple plug in, and it holds the controls steady so they don't fall off like other PS4 controller docking mounts. I also like that it shows you when the battery is fully charged. Would definitely buy another if I had more controllers.",5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
Works great! Charges fast. Sooo much easier than trying to charge with a micro USB cord. They never stay plugged in and wreck the charger cord with constant unplugging and plugging in.  Controllers stay charged since I can just put it on the dock whenever it's not being used.,5,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0
"I’ve used this charger for a little over a month and it started out working perfectly. Now, however it no longer changes colors to show you the battery life of your controller. I just turned on my PS4 and both chargers were “green” meaning charged, but one was totally dead. Now that I’m outside of the return window I’m stuck with it. Look elsewhere.",2,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
"When my son told me a week before Christmas this was his hearts desire I was worried about if i could find it or not. Amazon to the rescue . I found it easily , since I am a Prime member it came in 2 days! It works perfectly and my son was delighted. It's all he uses to charge his controllers now.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"This charger is a great value for what you get. It does charge really fast and for some reason my controllers seem to last longer between charges, over at the stock USB charger. Not sure if that is even possible but seems that way. It doesn't take up much space and looks nice. You can tell from a distance when you're controller is ready. I see no cons so far. The only thing in question would be the longevity.",5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"Only one of the two chargers work. I contacted the company and they took my information and then never responded. If they contact me and let me return and exchange, or send a new one then I will change my rating. Until the, I will give it two stars. Its easy to use, small, and seems pretty sturdy. Would be a great product if it worked 100%.",2,1,2019-2-21,1,1,0
I love this dock. It works great and is easily accessible. I keep my controllers on my nightstand so I can just reach over and grab one and replace it once it dies. The lights show when its charging and when it's good. The controllers shut off charging automatically once they're done so I can just leave them there like a caddy. I love it. No more fussing with wires or running to the system.,5,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
"It charges the controller fast. Small and has sleek look. However, I noticed if I leave the controller plugged in and turn off the PS4, the controller will lose its charge. So, I have to unplug the controller after the charging is complete. I was hoping to use the charging station as a docking station but I don't think it's possible.",3,1,2020-2-17,1,1,0
This charger is perfect for the space we have! It’s really easy to place the PS4 controllers on the charger and remove them. The front shows a green (fully charged) or red (not fully charged) light so my son can easily tell when they are done charging and ready for use. We had the stackable charger before and it was too tall and much harder to plug in the controllers.,5,1,2018-10-20,1,0,0
"Works perfectly except the charging indicator lights are backwards. The front light is for the back controller and the back light is for the front controller. This was a little confusing until I realized what was going on, but doesn't impact how they actually charge. A handy person could probably open it up and swap the wiring around if it bothered them that much.",4,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"It looks... really cheap honestly and the LED's are completely wrong on it, but for the price, its been very reliable and works well. It even fixed one of my controllers that my wife bricked by plugging it into her ""fast charge"" phone charger. I thought that controller was doomed until I read somewhere these dock chargers can possible fix it... and it did. Happy with the purchase, would recommend.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"So. One day shipping was great but the fact that the unit came with a charging cable that did NOT fit into the unit is a problem. I had my own extra cord to test the actual unit, but what if I didn’t? Now I would have to go through all the trouble of returning it. Smh. Unacceptable. Makes me feel like these units are refurbished but not labeled as that",3,1,2019-8-10,1,1,1
"I feel like some of the best products on Amazon are the most simple because you know what you're paying. Great Value, super easy to use, no noticeable issues thus far.I like how the controller indicates when the battery is charge ""red mode"" and when the battery is fully charged ""green mode"", one for each controller slot of course.",5,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
Everything is fine all but 1 thing you need 2 hands to remove the controller because the charging pin is super tight it feels like the charging pin could brake off if your not careful,3,1,2019-12-13,1,1,0
I bought this as a surprise gift for my son. Although he never asked for a charging dock I felt that it would be very handy to have one place where you can charge both your controllers simultaneously rather than having to switch the charging cable between two different controllers. The shipping was prompt and item arrived well packaged. My son (13yrs) was able to unpack and set it up all by himself. I think he had a little help from the instructions included with the product but for the most part it was pretty straight forward. The build quality of the dock exceeded my expectations considering how much I paid for it. It works well with both controllers and the little icons in the front can tell you if any of the controller is not docked correctly which could happen occasionally if you are in a hurry. Overall I am very satisfied with this product and how it has worked so far. Will definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for PS4 controller charging dock.,5,1,2018-10-9,1,0,0
"I don't used them so I don't really know much.  However, I helped my sons put their controller to charge once a while and seems to work okay.  Sometimes, looks like its done charge because of showing green light but once touch, the light turn red again (which means need charge).  I guess the port aren't tight enough so might be loosing.",4,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0
This thing isn’t charging my controller. The console says the controller has half charge but the device itself just stays green and doesn’t charge the controller.I’ve tried with console on and asleep. I’ve tried different USB ports in the front. The controller isn’t recognized by the device or just doesn’t work at all.,1,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"This controller charger was purchased as a Christmas gift for myself. However, I dont play video game's but I can say I haven't tripped, step on a controller nor tumbled over with my laundry since December 25th. It charges well and my teen boy's are also very happy with this gift. It arrived on time and would recommend this item and vendor for this purchase. Happy New Year Everyone 😅",5,1,2019-1-5,1,0,0
"This is very useful when the ports on the back of the controllers are loosened enough to prevent charging that way. This charger uses the port on the front of the controller instead, so I no longer need to struggle with getting the other port on the controller to work. Just be very careful with the charging cable port on this unit, as it can become loosened too. Now I never use this device's cable for anything else, so as to not loosen the port.",5,1,2018-10-16,1,0,0
I had ordered this almost six months ago and at first loved it because it was exactly what I was looking for and for a great price. It has now stopped working. I plug in dead controllers and it says they’re charged and they don’t charge. Which really sucks because I liked it so much initially I had just ordered a second one as a gift and now I’m concerned.,2,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"The top USB port on my controller stopped working and this product was just what I needed.  It allows me to charge the controller via the bottom EXT port and now I don't have to pay money to purchase an entire new controller.  It also works as a great stand to store my controllers, oppose to just leaving them lying around.",5,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0

"Because i have three controllers i needed to have a means to easily keep them charged up as often only one will be in use at any time, thus having a dual charger that does the job and looks well and needs only one USB slot is why I purchased this unit and it uses the better connectionat the rear  than the small SONY type plug at the front .  The charge indication lights are also a good thing to have a syou get a view of what is being charged",5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"I bought this so I could charge two controllers at once. Within a month it would only charge the front controller. I still use it to hold two of them out of the way, but when when is charged I switch them to charge the second one.

Ever since we started using it one of my controllers stopped charging completely. I can pop it on there and the light will turn red to show it’s “charging” but then immediately turn green and never actually charge the controller. The other one is fine though. So there’s really a 50/50 chance this works.,2,1,2019-6-16,1,1,0
This works great was looking for a replacement charger instead of the old cell phone style one I had before which wore out the connector in the control and had a hard time charging. This one uses the more solid input on the remote control located by the d pad.,5,1,2018-12-30,1,1,0
"I bought this because I was tired of having android cables go out on me and on top of that the ports on these controllers can be so finicky. The controllers rest very easily in the stand and charging speed is no different from a hardline. Do keep in kind that if you're planning on keeping this connected to your ps4 they will only charge if it is on or in resting mode, I keep it plugged in to my desktop so this isn't really a problem for me. Overall I'm extremely happy with this purchase.",4,1,2019-3-14,1,1,0
Kids lost the dongle for my old PS4 charger which isn't hard considering how small that bit is. This charger plugs directly into the PS4 and does not require a dongle. Simply plug it in and let it charge. Show red controller icon if needing a charge and shows green when good to go. Works like a charm.,5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"I had an issue with charging on one of the ports but I contacted the seller directly and they were able to assist me by sending me a new one.

"I've had this for about 4 months now, overall it's working and it's been working. Looks pretty cool too. I've always had problems of putting my controls to charge but that problem is gone cuz now I just mount them whenever I stop playing. I also connected it to my TV so whenever someone watches TV they charge.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,1
I am absolutely loving this charger because it’s super easy to use and even my 1 year old can plug in a controller to charge. There are no parts that can be broken off easily.

"This thing charges fast even during gameplay. I'm not even joking, my controller died in the middle of a fight in Monster Hunter (Yes I ignored the ""Almost dead"" notification) that you can't pause so I hurriedly connected the controller to this base and defeated the monster around 10 minutes later. And I am dead serious that it was fully charged and working around 3 or 4 hours after.The only issue With this is that you can't play comfortably with it charging, but if you're daring and lazy like me that won't be an issue.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I bought this for my kid who breaks and loses his controller chargers more than I break a nail.

"Great product! My 12 year old son loves it.  Its slim and easy to use, he set it up himselfThe front lights that shows its charging is super helpful, and I like that it's a little light up controller picture that shows up, not just some blinking little light.

"I absolutely love this product. Works as advertised. It is so nice to have my controllers out of the way and not plugged into the front of my PlayStation. I can put it up, away from my two year old kid and it is so handy to just grab one off the charger and go.  The cord is not very long so I added a small extension cord to give it some extra length. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a controller charger. It is a low cost and does a great job.

"Wanted something better than PITA micro-B cables jammed in at the weird angle and spot Sony opted to put the port and this fits the bill. Small footprint and easy to place your controllers in to charge. What a great thing to have.Also handy to diagnose charging issues if you've already happened to fry your controller(s) by using a high amp/volt charger as used by a lot of phones- which I did and this can sometimes let you get by if your battery is still good, but the USB board or cable are bad in your controller.",5,1,2019-3-12,1,0,0

"I bought this device and another as I often need to recharge more than two controllers.  It works very well, is easy to use and I can't think of a single negative to say about it.  If you need a recharger, you can't go wrong with this device.",5,1,2019-11-3,1,0,0
"Cons: sometimes it’s hard to align the controller to the charging dockPro: fast charging, and my controller stays charged a lot longer using this pod than any other ones I used. It’s also compact and can be placed anywhere without taking much space",5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
I’ve used the charging station once now.  I used a front USB port from the front of my PC.  I use my controllers on my PS4 Pro(in the same room).  The dock had a red controller icon show up on the dock front as soon as it was attached.  The next day when I let it charge overnight the icons were green.  I didn’t measure the time it took to charge.  I will update if any issues appear.,5,1,2018-6-26,1,0,0
"It didn’t work, I plugged it in and charged my controls. They were both low battery. I left them charging for a few hours but the lights didn’t change color and when I checked the batteries on the console they were both exactly the same as when I started to charge them. They didn’t charge at all. Disappointed with the purchase.Update: Although it was faulty the seller reached out to me to make things right. Great customer service.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0
So we picked this out for our 17yr old for his ps 4 slim. The unit came with a controller and a short USB cord so we picked this unit after reading all the reviews and comparing others and prices it works well and he has given it his very kool seal of approval great buy great price,5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"Would have given this 5 stars for the price and ease, but it will not work if plugged into the PS4 like the PS4 cables for charging, it has to be plugged into a block and a wall outlet.

"Love controller charger especially since before I only have one cable charger and 3 controllers, so if I was ever playing with multiple people is could get annoying trying to have a fully charged controller. It is nice and compact so it doesn't take up too much space.",5,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"This is now a household necessity! Hubby and I can charge our controllers easily and without multiple wires. The charger is compact, which is another plus.

Works great I'm worried about how long the connections to the controllers will last but will change my review if that ever happens. So far I am very pleased with this product and for the value even if something goes wrong I will more than likely buy it again,4,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"I have kids and this is THE BEST thing I have ever bought.

"So, so far I’ve only used it once so at the moment I’m unsure about the battery life and value of money. I saw them at five below for $5 , I’m hoping I didn’t pay more for than what it’s actually worth 🙄 we’ll see how it works in the long run though and after a few months I’ll do another review since there aren’t many reviews on an item like this.

It works nicely and very helpful at first but you don’t realize it’s slowly breaking the controls battery or something I’ve been useing this product to charge my controllers for a while now and I’ve noticed that slowly but surely my controllers have been dying a lot faster seens I’ve used this and one by one the controllers batteries will be so messed up I can’t use it like the light on screen will be green but when I try to turn it on my PlayStation tells me it’s dead and disconnects idk what to do and I’ve trashed about 3 controller because of this like come on man controllers aren’t cheap,1,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0

I have Ps4 controllers with broken charging ports and can no longer charge through cords. This was a saving grace for me because now I have a way to play on my ps4 again. I definitely can tell that it stay alive much longer than if charged by the cord and also appears to charge much faster as well but that may just be because of the fact you can't properly use the controller while its charging. I would give it 5 stars but I personally never do 5 stars on amazon since it always flooded with bots but this is a great product.,4,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"As soon as you give this is power both lights turn green! You won't see red until  you put in a low charger, but I would think you wouldn't see any lights at all until a controller is plugged in. It is strange to be using the controllers and see both lights on?",4,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0

"I was so tired of picking up my PS4 controllers to play a game and them being dead. My kids would never plug them into the cord that came with the PS4. The usual excuses being that, they forgot or couldn’t find the cord. Now, this cool looking charger sits right next to my tv with both of my controllers on top and plugged in with the green “fully charged” light on. What really sold me on this charger was all the protections it has. Over-current, Over-heated, Over-voltage, and Short-circuit protection. Great charger!",5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"It charges my controllers. Does it job, hasn't broken yet. Easy to tell when done charging. Hard to remove controllers with one hand which is kind of important to me when I have my baby in one arm always, but im certain its not a big deal to most so I won't fault it for that. Would buy another one if I ever get more than 2 controllers",5,1,2019-5-28,1,0,0
"I read reviews on numerous charges, and went with this one for my son.  It came in last week, and I read the instructions carefully, and it just doesn't work.

"I ordered this since I needed something more sturdy & easier to use so my kids can charge their wireless PS4 controllers. It arrived in great condition & looks exactly like the picture above. Easy to read/understand light up controller symbols to let you know when controllers are ready. It does not use batteries so you need to plug in the usb cord to the base and plug into PS4 or if your tv has a USB port then you can plug it there. The only downside is that since it does use a USB port to charge up the controllers, the power source that you have the base connected to needs to be on in order for it to work. So just keep that in mind if you plug it into the PS4. Other than that it’s a pretty good charger.",4,1,2018-5-22,1,0,0
It’s perfect! We have 3 controllers so we keep 2 on the charger and use the other. When it gets low we swap them out. When we play multiplayer we don’t have to worry about if they are charged or not. Before there were times we would have 3 dead controllers. We don’t have cable so we use Netflix Vudu Hulu and Prime. You need a charged controller for that lol. So this was a perfect Christmas gift for us!!,5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"I've bought charging stations in the past and was skeptical when I found this on a lightning deal. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at the speed this charges controllers! The footprint is small enough to be unobtrusive, even on my tiny desk. And best of all, it feels sturdy. My prior experiences with charging stations like this left me unsatisfied. Not this one. I'd recommend it highly!",4,1,2018-3-29,1,0,0
Very cool charger. You can plug the cord into a plug and plug it in the wall to charge all the time. Or you can plug it into the PS4 itself and it will charge the controls while the PS is on. If you want to plug it into the wall you will need the block since this doesn't come with it.,5,1,2020-4-19,1,0,0
"This has really helped with the dead controller issue we kept having in our house. Our kids would never plug the controllers in to charge and they would be dead when they wanted to go play. The simplicity of this charger is so nice! Our controllers actually get charged now, even by our 5 year old! I love this and if I get two more controllers I will get another one.",5,1,2019-3-17,1,0,0
As advertised. Works well and charges the PS4 controllers without any hassles. The charging indicators on the front is a nice touch - it turns red when it’s charging and green when charged. There are two indicators for each of the controllers.,5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"Pretty awesome and charges my controllers very easily. It could definitely work as an outlet charger, instead of using a USB slot for your PS4, and for that reason I’d love to have it come with a longer USB and wall plug. Otherwise, working as expected",5,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0
Really wish we bought this sooner. The secondary charging port on the controllers is much sturdier than the usb port. This charging station is great. Now we don't lose the controllers and they get charged more reliably.,5,1,2020-9-30,1,0,0
"The box it arrives in does not inspire confidence. The box has numerous references to "" the P4."" Nowhere does it say PS4 or Playstation. It's bulkier than it looks in the picture, but not too bad. It works as discribed. I like being able to charge from the bottom. MicroUSB cables seem to wear out pretty quickly when you you plg and unplug them a lot. The quality seems fine. I like the diagram of the controller at the front that indicates charging status.",5,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0

Very decent two controller dock. At first it’s kind of tough to get the remotes onto the base and connected but work pretty well and charges them fairly quickly.

"I have a PS4 controller that for some reason, although it will hold a charge when plugged into the back of the controller, it will not charge.

"I bought this little guy because my regular cables wouldn't charge my controllers and it was a great purchase! It's small so you can store it wherever and it lights up while charging so you know it's working.

"This charger doesn't work. It arrived, and the lights turn on when plugged in. Both lights on the charger show green even with no controllers connected. Putting a controller onto the charger does nothing, the lights on this charger stayed green even though the controller's battery was almost dead. It did not charge my controllers at all. Neither ports worked—terrible product and a waste of money. Feels cheap, even though I didn't expect much else. I did expect it to work, at least given the reviews. That is not the case, though.",1,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0

Charges very well but both lights stay green even when one controller is not connected which makes you think it is not working.  It does show red only if you used the controller for a long enough time.  It shows green when it might be bringing it up to full charge with light use.  Low price and both slots for work well for recharging.,4,1,2018-7-14,1,0,0

Only half of my charging ports ever worked.  The unit looks nice though on my entertainment center behind the TV.

This product only comes with the dock and a very short USB charge cable. You either have to have a USB wall charger already or if you're like me I had to to purchase additional ones. Due to the extremely short cable I had to purchase a longer one so I could put the charger where I wanted it in my entertainment center.

Works great. Had to switch to this charger because my boys would play their PS4 with the cord connected to the controller charging port on the back.

This product seems good if it really worked on the 5V 1A like it says but I tried multiple wall adaptors and it only partially works on those as only 1 controller station works at a time which is pointless.

It’s just so much easier having my controllers in one place and always having them in rotation of charging. Now instead of dealing with one large cord, I can charge both at a time and have them sitting out of the way.Obviously this only works while the PlayStation is on, so just make sure you always have one on the charger while the other is in use, so you don’t end up with both being dead.",5,1,2018-1-25,1,0,0

"So far I love the charging system. I can finally have the charger away from the ps4 and not have wires sticking out the front. I was skeptical on how it works but it works. Oddly enough. It seems like the battery life lasts longer. I used it a couple times and it seemed like after the initial charge. It lasts longer. Or maybe it’s just me. Either way. No complaints from me. It’s cheap and does it’s job. The only thing I’d like added is a charger adapter to plug in the wall. But I’m sure most of us have a ton just sitting around DC 5 isn’t horribly hard to find. It works off an iPhone wall adapter, windows phone adapters and Roku.",5,1,2017-10-23,1,0,0

"By far the best looking ps4 controller charger, unfortunately it didn't actually charge controllers.  One of the plugs that goes into the controller's charge port was missing and the other extremely flimsy, it broke as I set the controller on top to charge it.  I've never had a problem so completely crap that I have to wonder if maybe I got a one off lemon.  I returned it and will have to buy an uglier version from another brand as I don't trust this one any longer.",1,1,2017-10-26,1,8,0

Love this PS4 controller charger.  It's small and lightweight and doesn't take up much space.  It's easy to attach the controllers to the charging ports - just lay the controller on the backstop and slide it down onto the micro-usb port.  The big bright icons on the front of the charger make it easy to see from any distance if the controller is still charging (red) or fully charged (green).

The electricity light isn't on neither. Just two fully lit up green remotes. Extremely disappointed man. Instead of charging it with the PS4 USB I plugged the USB into the head of a Samsung charger and plugged it in the outlet which is connected to the charging station. When the station is plugged in the outlet and not the PS4 it charges both remotes how it is suppose 2 and the light turns red with the electricity picture on top but I know for a fact it's not suppose 2 be in the wall outlet. I'm assuming the output from the wall outlet is enough for the dock to now charge my two remotes but I might be messing it up and without even knowing.",2,0,2020-7-30,1,0,1

"This is a simple charger.  It has a USB charging cord, so you'll need a power brick to charge it (it doesn't come with one).  2 PS4 controllers fit nicely together on it.  It uses the bottom ports of the controller which I've never used before for anything.  I've been charging them on a stand that uses the port on the top, so it's kind of nicked up after all this time.  So I'm happy to use the lower ports now.  The unit itself has a nice small footprint and doesn't take up much space.  It's a good little organizer for your 2 controllers.  I don't get the large lights up front - They look neat but they are pretty big and are too bright to be on in my room at night.  The lights look like the controllers, which is neat but also unnecessary.  It lights green when charged or when it's just sitting there on it's own, and they turn red when charging a controller.  It will charge the controller even when they are on and in use.So far it's an upgrade from my previous charger.  I'll just stick some black tape over those large lights!!!",4,0,2018-11-26,1,0,0
"Worked right out the box, this comes with a USB cord you connect to the charging station that connects to your PS4. From there you just place 2 controllers on the charging slots and you're all set!

Very satisfied with this purchase.",5,0,2017-11-5,1,0,1
"My son was so excited about this, especially since I’m pretty dumb when it comes to gaming. This was apparently the perfect surprise gift.

My daughter can run a controller battery down in no time so we are constantly waiting for one controller to charge. Whats worse is when we can't find the cord to charge the darn things!

We just set it on the charging dock and it does its thing. So now we always have an easy time charging our controllers while also enjoying our game play.,5,0,2019-4-13,1,0,0
I've been using this guy for months. It's nice to be able to throw the controllers on here instead of pulling out a USB cable every other day. I also appreciate that it can charge two at a time with a single USB. This ensures you've always got a dualshock waiting in the wings and keeps your other USB port open to charge your headset. Charges just as fast as the USB and the green light lets you know when it's done. For the price you really can't beat this.,5,0,2019-7-15,1,0,0
"We have a number of controllers, and only so many charging methods -- when controllers are not properly placed in chargers, controllers do not charge.

"This charger does its job perfectly and I like that you see charge indicators for both controllers on the front of the unit.While this is a great charger, I could not give it a 5 on Ease of Use because I view the USB depency as a weakness.

It is pretty easy to use and obvious how to connect the controllers for charging.  I only ding it because it didn't include a USB charger (just the cable - which wasn't especially long).  The charger itself doesn't feel awfully sturdy so we'll see how it holds up over time but it worked for the two controllers I have.It's compact and easy to use.,4,0,2019-4-18,1,0,0
"While this charger feels very light (and therefore, as another recent review noted, pretty flimsy), it definitely does the job. Wish it came with a wall socket adaptor rather than just the USB cord , because I don't like having cords hanging out of the front of my PS4, but at the current price (under $15) it's a good buy. I also like that the stations light up when a remote is charging (red) and finished charging (green).",4,0,2018-12-6,1,0,0

"The Beboncool PS4 DualShock controller dual charging dock, made in China, comes with the charging dock, USB to micro USB cable, and documentation.  A charge indicator shows two images of a controller, each indicating if the controller is actively charging when red or is charged beyond 70% when green.  Limiting charging to below 70% charge is an attempt to preserve battery life.  Placing the controllers in the charging dock is simple.I would prefer an outlet adapter be included.  I currently have the charger plugged into one of the PS4’s limited USM ports.

"Shows red when charging and green when done, easier to determine than when using a single cable.  Nice little iconic pictures show the colors.  Charges faster than standard USB cable, perfect for those two player competitions.  You get two equally charged units done quickly when needed for next game dual.  Great price for nice compact charging device, that goes great with the game console.  Has features to prevent overcharge as well, so a good unit.  This is important to have that feature, I had some power packs for one of my hand held systems, and they basically overcharged and started smoking destroying the charging electronics.  I had to have them rebuilt at a local battery specialist place.  Recommended for PS4 owners who use multiple controllers.",5,0,2018-12-16,1,0,0
"This is exactly what I needed! With my PS3 I used to have to leave my station on with the controller plugged in via USB to charge so it’s ready for next time, but I would have to remember to come back and shut it off. That also overrode my HDMI switch with my setup so I can’t do anything else on the TV meanwhile.Now with my PS4 and this dock, I can have the dock plugged into a USB jack independent of the PS4 and charging every time after use with no cables stretched across the room or needing to keep the PS4 on just to charge the controller.",5,0,2019-3-19,1,0,0
I was getting tired of constantly having to plug in my controllers one at a time into my PS4 and then setting it into rest mode. I decided to get this charger because I could easily charge both controllers quickly and at the same time. It's pretty much a plug-in and start charging basic setup. Now I just plug the charger into the walls and seat both of my controllers onto the dock. It has a color indicator that shows red when charging and green when fully charged. It's able to charge them completely in around 2 hours or so. This is the best purchase because I no longer have to fiddle with making sure the PS4 is charging my controllers correctly. I just wish I had purchased this many years ago to save me tons of hassle.,5,0,2019-3-19,1,0,0
"Its nice.  A small little dock for two controllers, plugged it in and with no controllers on it both lights came on green.  Not discouraged I plugged in both controllers hoping to see them turn red.  Didnt happen.  Powered on one controller in the dock, battery indicator was not blinking indicating charing.  Unplugged usb from base bad plugged into controller its self low and behold....it charges....try the dock again and nothing.  Why would a company continue to make something THEY KNOW DOES NOT WORK?

"Great product!  This device plugs right in to my PS4 and although getting both controllers to fit in together was challenging at first, I soon got the hang of it.  The best part is probably the lights on the front that not only let you know when the controller is fully charged, it also provides a status on just how charged up it is.  Another nice feature that is probably overlooked by some, is the rubber grips on the bottom that keep it in place and not getting pulled off on to the floor all the time.Nice addition for a gamer that is always having to worry about having a charged controller available.",5,0,2018-12-18,1,0,0
I was excited for this item. My brother has never had issues with controllers being low power and he never had to have a 10ft or longer cable to game when low on power. He has had something that does the same and so I wanted the benefit of dual controller charging as well.I was disappointed right away with the sheer size of this item. I decided that it was ok because it needed to be big enough to hold 2 controllers and other than the charging components and the smart chip inside it shouldn't be heavy. Then came time to use it and I notice right away the green lights don't go away.,3,0,2017-11-4,1,0,1

"This is my second dual-charger for my PS4 and I like this one better than the other, simply because it has a low profile and can fit into tighter places, like smaller shelves and cubbies.  The feedback (charging indicator) also appears quicker than with my other one, so I'm not sitting there guessing if I got a good connection or not.",5,0,2019-1-6,1,0,0
"This is a great little charger, with nice LED indicators. It's easy to attach and remove the controllers. I'm only docking it a star because it doesn't include a wall plug -- you have to either provide your own, or plug this into a USB jack. (It does include a USB cable.)",4,0,2019-3-3,1,0,0
"It charges my controllers, sometimes, but very slowly and inaccurately. Packaging was in good shape (albeit minimalistic) and the charger looked good out of the box. Shows the green light for controllers being fully charged, then they die after five minutes of use (normal charging gives them a few hours of use). Mine is probably just defective, but given the price, quality and the cheap ""wholesale"" appearance of the plain white box it came in I wouldn't be surprised if defects are common. Proceed with caution if you aren't interested in the effort of replacing one of these; I wish I would've just spent a little more on a more reliable brand.",1,0,2018-11-8,1,1,0
"These charge pretty well. Make sure your devices are securely in there to charge. The downside is the indicator lights aren’t entirely accurate - making it more important to make sure your controller is placed properly on the charging ports. The good thing is the PS4 controller will light up with a different color indicating it is charging or not. It’s much more convenient than trying to deal with cords and wires. Despite the small hiccup of the battery indicator not working for me, it does charge efficiently.",4,0,2018-4-18,1,0,0

This dual charger holds our PS4 controllers solidly and displays them in a way that invites me to play God of War and Spider-Man. It also really helps tidy up the look of our entertainment center. 5 stars for high quality form and function for $13???!!,5,1,2019-1-10,1,3,1
"There is not much you can say about something that does so little, outside of that it does exactly what it is supposed to do. It charges PS4 controllers, and it does it well. There isn't much to it outside of a simple plastic body, a few LEDs on the front and a micro USB cable. You plug it into the PS4 or any wall adapter, drop your controllers into it, and presto, your controllers are charging.The only thing we could pick at is the fact that it plugs into the controllers via micro-USB as you slide the controller into it. This forces you to help guide it in and apply some pressure to make full contact. It isn't as easy as some of the Xbox One or 360 dock options that simply drop right in and make contact. However, this is because those solutions replace the batteries with their own rechargeable battery solution that charges via metal contacts.  You can't do that with the PS4 controllers since their batteries are built-in. So this dock (and others) are forced to use the micro-USB port, thus there isn't any getting around this. In the end, we couldn't hold it against the dock, thus it didn't affect the score.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,4,1

"Gone are the days of waiting hours for my controller to charge. Gone are the days of having to plug it into the PlayStation while I play. This gem charges quicker than any charger for any device I have ever seen. I love that I can spend all day playing with one of the kids and then charge both at the same time. When it first came I had a really hard time getting it lined up correctly, but I eventually got the hang of it - I can be taught - and now it locks in place without a problem. The only bummer I have encountered is that the two controllers with rubber covers cannot fit. Thank goodness the kids use those and sit in the chair right next to it so it can plug into the ps4, while I use the others, lol.",5,1,2018-9-13,1,6,0
"Got tired of forgetting to plug in my controllers, and trying to find a USB cable. So I ordered this. And wow! I didn’t even know you could charge a PS4 controller with the port on the bottom. But this thing does it, and quickly! Now I just put them on the base when I’m done, and grab the other controller the next time I play.It also allows me to charge both controllers simultaneously while keeping my other USB port free for my wireless headset!",5,1,2019-1-22,1,7,1
"This uses the bottom holes in your controller to charge them. My kids are rough on controllers and have wore the USB ports out on otherwise good controllers. Much easier for them to plug the controllers into this one. I know there are other chargers out there that use dongles. While the dongle chargers are good for my controllers, the kids keep losing them. So went with this instead, which was great.",5,1,2020-3-5,1,0,0
"It comes with a 6"" USB A to Micro cable.  My issue is it will not charge from the PS4 console if the unit is powered off.  But will, of course, charge when powered on and or if the console is in rest mode.  As for the rest of the unit, it cradles my PS4 controllers nicely and the front red/green charging/charged indicators are nice.

We just rest the controllers on the charger and it will either light red or green. Flawless.

I hated the finicky nature of the micro USB cables for the PS4 controllers and I thought they looked messy. Enter this dock! The perfect solution to my issues. It looks great sitting next to the console and the controllers are super easy to plug in. The light indicators are a helpful feature and it has non-slip dots on the bottom to keep it firmly in place.

"I've heard of these third party items for charging controllers, but never bought one until now. The standard single cord that comes with the default controller when you buy a PS4 can be sometimes flimsy when charging because it needs to literally be plugged into the console to charge while you play. If you have multiple controllers you need to plug one to a cord while another is on standby.This is surprisingly efficient as you can charge both controllers at the same time and be notified about the charging status by the icon located on the front of the charging station. This is something I should have bought years ago, and is essentially a must for anyone who uses multiple controllers on the PS4 they own on a daily basis. The charge actually lasts about a day if you use it, and it takes about two to four hours for a recharge through the USB port when connected to a power source.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0

My only complaint is that the micro-usb port for power seems to not work unless the cable coming in has some pressure pushing down.  I attached this with velcro inside my couch and was able to fix the power cable as well so it is not an issue anymore, if this were sitting out on a tv stand however it might by a problem.  I bought a seperate 2.1A wall outlet charger to hook this to, and it will charge a controller up very quickly.",4,1,2018-6-19,1,2,0

This is the first day!",1,1,2019-5-30,1,3,0
"As many others have gone through, the primary charging ports on my controllers have loosened from the circuit board and because of that only charge if you lay it and the cable down carefully.I now own 4 controllers all with the same problem, I opened one up and fixed it (maybe temporarily) but the time and effort to save $60 for a new controller is questionable.",5,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"I bought this for the kids Playstation hoping to keep the controllers from laying all over the couch, and keep the controllers from tying up the phone charger cords all the time.  This charger base does that, and the kids actually use it, so it must  be convenient!Works well charges controllers and organizes them. Just place the controller on the charger port and press it into place, light changes from green to red to indicate charging.  The only thing I noticed that was somewhat confusing and I suppose uses more power than needed.  The indicator lights for the charging ports are green even if no controller is mounted, if a controller is charging the indicator light is red, fully charged controller is green and empty space green.  It would make more sense if no indicator light is on when controllers aren't mounted.",4,1,2018-1-30,1,2,0
"I really like this charging pod.  I was admittedly skeptical at first, but I have been using it daily for about 2 weeks now with no issues.  it is actually rather aesthetically appealing, so I can leave it out on top of a tv stand next to the console and it looks rather nice sitting there.  the LCD display is very attractive as well, extremely easy to read, and VERY bright. - Can see it perfectly from across the room, EVEN WITH the lights on.  I would absolutely recommend this for ANY PlayStation gamer.  In fact, I also bout the genuine PlayStation dock at the same time just in case I didn't like this one, or had problems with it falling over...  I never even opened the PS charging pod, and sent it back because I was so satisfied with this one.  I actually think this one looks nicer anyway.  And zero issues with it falling over.  Built nicely.",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"Otherwise, this product functions great.  The only problem is that the lights on the front are reversed.  When you plug in a dead controller in the back, the front light will light red, and vice versa.  This is confusing enough to be annoying, but not reason enough to replace it.  The controllers get charged up nicely, and it plugs into the cord I was using to charge just one of these.  It doesn't come with an AC adapter but I don't think it's necessary.",2,1,2019-1-27,1,2,0
"I desired a DS4 dual charging dock with charging LEDs and for both controllers to dock upright (because docking the controllers upside down is just awkward and looks strange). This dock powers through a single USB connection and can be plugged into one of the USB ports on the PS4. The dock will charge the controllers even when the PS4 is turned off (stand by mode).The only issue I have with the dock at the moment (which is not a really an issue but more of a gripe) is that the LEDs are reversed. So the top LED is for the bottom controller and the bottom LED is for the top controller. This makes it somewhat confusing and will take some time to get used to, especially if you are charging two controllers at once.",4,1,2017-8-21,1,2,0
"Worthless to me. I got this because I am sick of the constant error messages I get with my extra long cables.""headset disconnected, etc."" There is no fix for this, so I figured this product would help. Only problem is, its power source is the PS4, so when I turn the system off with my depleted controller, I can't charge it with this product. I am aware that I can get a wall adapter and other fixes.  But it's just easier now to use the extra long cable and then unplug it when I want to play,  so I don't get the annoying messages on the PS4. Also the first docking port didn't even recognize or charge the controller.",1,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0

"The low profile of this product is very useful for me as I store the remotes on a shelf that is not too high.  This fits perfectly.  Unfortunately, the charging in slot 1 is a bit inconsistent.  Slot 2 has worked well right out of the box.  I've had to wiggle the remote to get slot 1 to engage and charge.  I've tried both remotes that I own and both behave the same so it has to be a contact issue with slot 1.  Other than that, I really like this product for ease of use and storage convenience.",3,1,2019-3-13,1,1,0
"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter that received an XBox for Christmas.  It plugs in and works right out of the box.  The USB cable could have been a little longer but it works perfectly fine.  It's a little difficult to determine what degree of charged each device is visually (like a percentage or flashing light or something), but this isn't a deal-breaker.Also, the tilt at which the chargers are inserted into the base could have been re-designed a bit.  You have to try two or three times to have it set properly.  I would purchase again if needed.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0
"I have used several different PS4 controller chargers over the last few years. This one is above and beyond the best I have tried!

The unit itself is sleek looking with a lovely screen showing if a controller is charged, charging, or nearly finished. The only downside I've had is that sometimes they can be tricky to remove with one hand, but that is down to the relative newness of mine and how firmly I put the controllers on the cradle. 9.8/10!",5,1,2019-12-4,1,1,0
"Why I got it:I needed a standalone stand to charge my PS4 controllers instead of using a USB and having the controllers just on top of tables or whatever. I only have two controllers, so this was perfect.",3,1,2018-5-8,1,6,0
"We've gone through I don't know how many usb cords, and I had a cooling fan/charge ports for the PS4 but it required one of the PS4 ports to plug into.  With my daughters USB wireless headphones and the external HD this became useless on that cooling fan charge station.  The cable for this unit was too short to use a separate wall plug.  This one has a long cable which I use an old phone charger USB outlet plug to plug into.  The only downside I have is you have to make sure you seat the controller well for it to charge.  Part of that, though, may be an issue with the controller itself as one of the controllers I had does not seem to charge using any method now.  A new controller charges fine as long as you firmly place it in the charging port.",4,1,2018-12-26,1,0,0
"Solid product, so easy to use. No more messing with extension batteries that fall out on the ground every time or plugging in cables.Also, I didn't know this plugs in on the inside of the controller. Didn't know controllers have two spots for charging. I put my controllers on it, and never have to worry about running out, it's always charged. Easy to use, easy to put in, snugly fits and easy to take out. Glad I ignored all the negative reviews on this. Will recommend.",5,1,2019-10-17,1,0,0
"I read some bad reviews about this product and then some that praised it. We took a chance because I liked the fact that they charge from the rear of the controller instead of the front, much easier and more stable! I have had none of the problems at all described by others. I've had the charger for about 4 months now and they work perfectly just as described and charge the controllers very fast. I highly recommend this product.",5,1,2020-3-19,1,0,0
I got so tired of my usb charger for my controller. I would trip over them occasionally and it was really annoying having to plug them in while I played games because I couldn’t change positions without pulling the cord.So I bought one for myself and the other for my man! We love them! They charge our controllers pretty quickly and they look nice and sleek.,5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,1
"First of all this charger doesn't do anything more than any other charger will do, be it from your console or a USB adapter from what I have observed. This charger requires that you plug it into a 5v source because no adapter is included with it. This charger will keep you from damaging the USB port of your controller and will allow you to charge your controller via the headset input on the opposite side even if you are unable to charge it through the USB port. I love it, it works very well.",5,1,2019-2-16,1,0,0
"Excellent charger for the controllers as it is much simpler to lay them on this charger than to try to plug in a micro USB cable. No complaints, charges quickly and easily. Construction is a little lackluster but not enough to remove a star. It is sturdy enough for what it was designed for.",5,1,2018-10-4,1,0,0
I'm happy I made this purchase it is super slim so doesn't take up much space and is really convenient to keeping the controllers charged. I do feel like they don't stay charged but that may or may not have anything to do with the charging station I really don't know for sure.,5,1,2019-2-21,1,0,0

"It works as promised. The only issue is the need to plug the controller into the charger as opposed to simply placing the controller on the charger, but I expect that's mostly due to the PS4 controller's design.",4,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0
"Got this for my controllers because the charging cords were in the way and frayed, and for the week I have had it; it’s been wonderful. My controllers charge super fast and hold the charge for a long time. Amazing product at a good price!",5,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"The charger works, it keeps the controllers charged.But, there must be an unwritten threshold for the battery to have discharged to make the front light be red instead of green. The only time I've seen the red light was when the controller had a 1/3 charge according to the PS4",4,1,2019-2-5,1,0,0
"This charger is excellent! It's small, easy to use, and fully charges my controllers without trouble. I especially live that it tells me when a controller is done charging even though the controller already does it on its own. Way better tonuse than a regular usb cable. Would recommend it to anyone.",5,1,2019-3-24,1,0,1
Charges in a fair amount of time. Takes up minimal counter space. Averages about an hour to fully charge a dead controller. Only drawback is that the port is sometimes hard to rest in the cradle. But works great.,5,1,2019-11-10,1,0,0
Thought my PS4 controller went bad because it wouldn’t charge anymore. Apparently it’s a common flaw where the micro USB port goes bad and won’t charge. This charges through the bottom ports which saved my controller. Great product and charges 2 controllers fast through 1 USB port.,5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
Doesn’t take up too much space. Both controllers can sit on it without falling off. There is even a picture of each controller that shows up and lets you see how charged each remote is.,5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
Plugged in and used right away. I have 2 controllers and one is always charged and ready so never any down time. This charges on the mic side of the charger so even a controller with a worn usb port would still charge if that was your only problem. Great product.,5,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0
"I really like this. It charges fast and uses the mic port to charge. You need your own wall outlet plug, but that wasn’t a problem for me. I like how there are indicators that change from red to orange then green when fully charged. It’s lightweight and doesn’t take up a lot of space.",5,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0
Bought this for my hubby for Christmas. We love it. Plan to order another one for my daughter. It’s easy to set up and easy to charge. Love seeing the color so we don’t over change it. Great buy.,5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,1
I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He loves it. I hated always having the long charging cord laying across our living room so I searched for a cordless charging option and came across this charging station. It’s perfect. My husband can use one controller while the second is sitting on the charger and switch them when the controller dies.,5,1,2019-6-16,1,0,0

"I have this plugged in to the ps4, so it only charges the controller while the console is on, but that is not the sellers fault, just how I have it set up.

The charging stations I buy - no matter who makes them - seem to only be able to charge one controller at a time. This one is no different. I plug two dead controllers in and one lights up charging.,2,1,2019-8-5,1,1,0
"For me, if both controllers are placed to charge, only one of the red lights turns green, which indicates only 1 is charging, I don’t know if that’s only mine that does that, but that’s what mine does. Wish it could knock out 2 at a time, but still satisfied with the product, good quality, light weight, and compact.",4,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"Absolutely has been a lifesaver, we no longer have more than one dead controller in the house at any given moment. when the ps4 is in rest mode, the controllers will still charge, so every day we wake up to controllers fully charged",5,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0
"One thing I like is that it lights up red if it’s still charging and green if it’s done - right on the display in the front, so you can see it from across the room. It is very easy to tell which one is which also. Good investment.",5,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
"Does the job, but only 75% of it. The station stops charging once the controller reaches 75% so it limits the life after being undocked. I actually stopped using it a week ago and plug in one at a time using the cord to charge them up fully.",4,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"Great charger, controller mounts well, charges fast. Only complaint would be when the controller is near charged the dock light doesnt know wether to be red or green so it kinda flickers on and off between red and green.",4,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0
"Love these chargers - so much easier putting the controllers in the mic slot for charging. Indicators are great. The one I use the most had the back slot stop working, I still use it daily and front works fine. My second one has had no issues so far.",4,1,2019-6-29,1,0,0

Charges ps4 controllers to full and keeps them fully charged until I use them.  Looks nice.  Best feature is that the lights tell yoi when the controller is fullly charged so you can cycle your contollers on it to get them all charged quickly.  I would totally recommend this to anyone that likes a clean desk look by organizing desks space to have less clutter.,5,1,2019-12-9,1,0,1
The back charger stopped working within 4 months. Tested it with several controllers and none would charge on that spot. Only on the front half.,1,1,2019-10-1,1,1,0
This thing works great. I really like that thr controllers use the USB-C connection on the bottom. It's a secure connection and dont think there's much risk with damaging the connection port like there can be with the micro USB port on top. The controllers slide into position very easily. The indicator lights are a nice touch too.,5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"Love this. Just set the remotes on the port (using the headphone port) and it charges them. The indicator turns green when the remote is charged. If you’re looking for something that will remain on after you’ve turned off your PS4, this is not it. It only charges when the system is on— which is fair IMO. Anyways, I highly recommend this product!",5,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
"Very happy with this purchase.  The cradle is attractive, holds the controller firmly and always charges appropriately for me.  I like the light-up indicator on the front to let you know if it's actively charging the controller (red), or has a full charge (green).",5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"My sons have obliterated all of our charging cords. I did not know this charger existed. The top USB port doesn't even work well on our remotes so I thought I needed to replace them. Nope, just from the cords being ripped in and out. This works very well.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,0,0
"This was a great quick solution for my child who always forgets to plug his controllers in, it also is great because you don't have to worry about your kid trying to shove a charger into the port the wrong way ruining a $70 controller! Defiantly worth the money.",5,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
"This is great to keep your controllers organized and charged. I was always leaving controllers on side tables, or the tv cabinet, and would find them low on charge. This means they are always in one place and ready to use when I need them.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"This does not come with a wall charger. So you need to either buy an outlet for it or hook it up to the PS4. I had bought this to be on my end table near the couch vs near the system, so it didnt work for me.",1,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0

I have tried several different options to charge my son's (2) PS4 controllers and nothing compares to this prodcut.

"I used to have a cable charger. Because I want to buy another controller, I bought this charging dock. It fits just right. It is faster ,too.

"I've had a PS4 for years and have always been annoyed at having to charge the controllers separately. It was always a struggle to find a way to charge them, find the cable, and keep things organized. This charger entered my life and is an absolute must-buy for the PS4.It charges two controllers by plugging into the front of them. I never knew there were charging ports there. It'll show a green controller when it's fully charged, or red if it's not. You can keep it plugged in (doesn't include an AC adapter) all the time, making it easy to charge your controllers any time.",5,0,2019-3-18,1,0,0
"I needed a charger, and of course, one for two controllers makes sense. The charging is definitely good, and while I haven't timed the charging, I've never grabbed a controller that wasn't fully charged, and it seems to charge to full capacity by the time I check again.Even without the fact that it's a charger, it's actually a great way to store controllers. I think that game controllers often just get dropped wherever, and so having a docking station for them is pretty nice for keeping things organized. It's a factor that I hadn't considered at all in getting this. It's an unobtrusive docking station, and it fits in neatly with everything else on our entertainment center. You can't go wrong with it.",5,0,2019-1-7,1,0,0
"I hate micro-USB ports. It’s the main thing that keeps me away from Android phones. We have five PS4 controllers, and I bought two of those because I thought the batteries had gone, but really it was the micro USB cords. That was an expensive lesson.Well this charger plugs into THE OTHER SIDE of the controller, which seems like a much more robust connection.  Also, there is a little green controller-shaped LED that lights up when the controller is charged (it’s red when charging).  I plugged this into one of the USB ports that the micro USB cords were formerly plugged into.",5,0,2019-2-25,1,0,0
"This simple charging unit is designed perfectly not to take up a lot of space, and charge two PS4 controllers effectively. Lights on the front of the unit are clear and instantly give the current status of the charge. Green for fully charged, and red for charging.  The unit is relavively small, but that works well for tight spaces.The unit is powered by USB and the only issue is that the PS4 base needs to be on for the USB port to provide power. That being said, any USB power port from any source will activate the charging capability of the dock.",5,0,2018-12-4,1,0,1
"We have another dual-charge dock for PS4 controllers but THAT ONE requires using the controller to push down a large connector which I guess was designed to make sure you have the controller aligned - but it does not work. This design is much better with a connector out where you can see it and a pretty intuitive way to mount the controllers on it. The indicator lights (outline of controller in red for charging, green for charged) looks nice. The unit itself is very light and I am not sure how well it will hold up to long term use, but so far we're very happy with it.",4,0,2018-12-17,1,0,0
"We have two XBOX 360s, XBone (awful), every generation of Nintendo everything, and PS1, 2, & 4... So dangling cables\controllers are a problem. We got something similar for the 360 in the living room a while back, and when I saw a PS4 equivalent, I had to give it a go (there were PERPETUALLY controllers lying about with USB cables plugged into the front of the consoles).Does what you expect, while being about as compact as you could expect. Vast improvement, I'm extremely happy with it and I recommend everyone with a PS4 switch over to one of these.",4,0,2018-12-20,1,0,0
"The charger works very well. The controllers are held snugly in the docks and it charges them quickly. The indicators seem to be accurate, and clear. It doesn't take up much space and as of yet, seems to work perfectly. The charger also seems to be of relatively good quality although the plastic didn't feel the most sturdy. Overall a good charger.",5,0,2019-4-10,1,1,0
"This charger stands out in my mind due to the fact that it doesn't stand out. Unlike many controller chargers I've used in the past this one goes out of its way to appear subdued and not stand out too much in your cabinet. The charge status lights are great, work well and make sure that you always know when your chargers are ready to go. Base has some rubber feet on the bottom that do a great job of keeping it where it's at.",5,0,2019-1-5,1,0,0
Controllers fit in perfectly and it helps me keep things organized on my entertainment center.  Just a USB to micro USB connection and had no issues hooking up.  I have taught my kids to keep them there so now I always have a fully charged controller.,5,0,2019-4-12,1,1,0

This product is great. I have had this for a few months now and I have absolutely zero complaints. So much more convenient than the short cord that comes with the PS4.

There are better chargers for PS controllers. This one is annoying because it takes two hands to use and it’s hard to line up the port. It also feels super cheap. I have a better one that uses springs to make it easier to line up and use with one hand.,2,0,2018-12-31,1,0,0

"Nachdem ich mit meiner Erstbestellung einer Lade- Stauraumlösung für die PS4-Move&DS Controller ziemlich schlechte Erfahrungen machen durfte (ein DS-Controller sowie ein Move Controller tot) kann ich über diese Station nur positives berichten.Als Netzteil kommt ein iPhone Netzteil (Das schmale, kleine) zum Einsatz, und beide Controller werden sofort erkannt und geladen. Die erwähnenswerte, durchdachte Kleinigkeit ist die ""Führung"" um die Controller mit dem Ladeanschluss zu verbinden, hier wird ganz simpel der Kopfhörerausgang verwendet.

"Ho acquistato questa basetta di ricarica per i controller della PS4 per evitare di occupare le porte USB della PS4. Esteticamente è molto bella, accanto alla PS4 fa la sua bella figura. Per quanto riguarda la qualità è ben fatta, robusta ed elegante. Sulla base ha dei piedini antiscivolo molti utili e, sulla parte frontale, due icone a forma di joypad le quali si illuminano per mostrare lo stato di carica, di rosso durante la ricarica e di verde a ricarica completa. Sono necessarie circa 3 ore per ricaricare entrambi i JoyPad.La basetta va collegata tramite cavo microUSB in dotazione, ad una porta USB della console o ad un caricatore da parete.",5,1,2019-7-15,0,4,1

Ho comprato questo prodotto perchè ero ESASPERATA di trovare i controller della ps4 di mio figlio sparsi per tutta casa. Più di una volta è successo di calpestarli o smarrirli per poi trovarli nei posti più impensabili.Con questo caricatore una volta utilizzati i controller vengono riposti nella loro posizione creando così ordine e anche un bell'effetto ottico perchè hub ha sul fronte uno schermino che dice quale caricatore è caraico e quale sta caricando.,5,1,2019-4-29,0,0,0
"Ottimo prodotto con un buon rapporto qualità-prezzo. Gli unici problemi da segnalare sono la mancanza dell'adattatore, ma qualsiasi caricabatterie da telefono va benissimo (specialmente se da 2A), e la difficoltà nell'inserire i joypad nella carica. Si deve infatti armeggiare un pochino prima di trovare la giusta posizione.Per il resto fa il suo lavoro e carica i joypad abbastanza velcoemente. Se non sbaglio poi dovrebbe avere un circuito che fermi la carica una volta raggiunto il massimo, per cui si possono lasciare i joypad attaccati anche al 100% di batteria.",5,1,2020-8-9,0,0,0

"Good PS4 controller charger.  Easy to use and it can be charged via a USB supply if you want, which is a bonus.  Seems to charge my controllers at the same rate as the official charger.  It has a light at the front of the base, which shows the charging, red for low and green for fully charged.Seems robust and should last a good time until the PS5 comes out.",4,0,2018-12-25,0,0,0
"Excellent value PS4 Controller Charging Dock from BEBONCOOL. It charges our controllers just as well as the proprietary brand, but at a fraction of the purchase price. Just as quick, just as much charge and no extra hassles. Couldn't be simpler to use......just connect to a USB socket with the provided cable, put the controllers in the dock and that's it. Well Pleased!",5,0,2019-1-2,0,0,0

"I was looking for a stocking filler for my son, he has a PS4 and two controllers. This allows both of them to be charged at the same time.

"This product took a bit of wiggling to get the contoller into the ports properly, but once I did it was fine. The plastic construction of this item was a bit cheap and it was also difficult to place the USB plug into the back.  That said, the LED charging lights were really useful to determine completion.  A good price.",4,0,2019-1-17,0,0,0
"Very handy charger. I plug this into an old phone charger and it works fine. I like the front LEDs that turn red whilst charging and green when the controller is full. Not a fast charge, but more convenient than having to connect a cable to the PS4 directly.",5,0,2019-1-5,0,0,0
"I had been meaning to get a charging dock for my PS4 so this is product’s arrival was good timing.First impressions are sub-par. It comes simply packaged in a cardboard outer with various poorly-worded or badly-translated sentences and bullet-points strewn across it - such as ‘For P4 Wireless Controller’ (I notice they don’t use the word ‘Playstation’ anywhere on the box - probably for copyright or Sony-approved quality standards reasons). There are three boxes on the front stating “PS4”, “Slim” & “Pro” - which are entirely irrelevant as the different Playstation console variants have no bearing on the controllers - which are the same across all Playstation 4 models.",3,0,2019-1-20,0,1,0
"Most of these PS4 controller docks charge the controllers using the USB-micro port on the top but this one, like the official Sony device, charges using the EXT on the bottom edge. I don't think it makes any real difference to the speed of charging but it does look better having your controllers straddling the dock right-way-up. Unlike the official Sony product the connectors on this dock are in a fixed position and the controllers just click down onto them and start charging. The front panel has two indicators that show the current state of each controller, red for charging and green for ready-to-go.There's no mains adaptor supplied with the dock but you can connect the dock to your PS4, so charging two controllers from one cable, or connect it to your existing phone or tablet charger. If you connect to your PS4 make sure that it's set to supply power through USB when it's in standby mode (that's switched off by default) or it defeats the purpose. If you want to charge them faster use a 2.0A mains charger, like those supplied with iPads and many tablets. A USB cable is included in the box but it's not very long and you might want to find something longer for use with mains chargers. I've also seen an identical-looking dock to this one available from other suppliers so it might be worth price-checking to make sure you're getting the best deal. Otherwise it's a really handy and neat solution to keeping your controllers topped up and a worthwhile accessory for your PS4.",5,0,2019-2-6,0,0,0
"We have been using the charging port now for several weeks and it appears to be working well.  The charging unit is compact and is capable of charging 2 controllers at once, with a small display on the front of the unit which shows you if a controller is charging (red) or fully charged (green).  The unit is powered via a USB plug, so you can charge you controllers through your PlayStation and keep everything together.  To charge your controller you simply place it on the docking connection, the light on the controller lights up and the display on the front of the charging unit will turn to red to show that the controller is charging.  The only down side that I have found with this unit is that is you favour wearing a skin on your controller this could hinder the charging of your controller, but other than that we are finding this to be a great charging unit.",4,0,2019-1-19,0,0,0
"This a very good addition to your gaming console setup.  The charging unit itself is an attractive black docking station with lights indicating controller connection.  This is particularly good for keeping your controllers safe and out of the way when not in use.It connects to the Playstation or charging plug via a mini USB lead.  Once you have finished playing you place your controller into the docking station and it starts to charge straight away.  It doesn’t take long either, with room on the docking station for two controllers it is possible that untidy wires connecting controller to PS4 is a thing of the past.",4,0,2019-1-7,0,0,0
"This EBONCOOL PS4 Controller Charger, whilst not being a well-known brand - really delivers. Robust, more than a little water resistant (kids hey?) and easy to set up (the power cable it a little fiddly, but you only have to plug that in once. It's a great piece of kits which works well. The light indicator on current charge levels is large and bright, so you see it even if it's across the room, under the TV cabinet.Lets put it this way, before I got this, the most annoying thing about gaming was finally getting some time to myself only to find that I had to either sit right next to the TV, or at a weird angle near the wall because I had no power and it needed charging. Since I got this, it has never happened. Brilliant. Would recommend.",5,0,2019-2-19,0,0,0
"For PS4 enthusiasts, this is an easy way to charge your handsets overnight (or at any other time) without the PS4 itself running to keep a single handset charged. This will independently charge two handsets at the same time or just one.  Two take about 3 hours to charge. There is an outline of each handset at the front numbered 2 with 1 beneath so that you can easily identify which is which. During charging the outline is red. Once fully charged the symbol changes to green. There is even intelligent charging built in to prevent overcharging. Compatible with Sony PlayStation 4/ PS4 Slim/ PS4 Pro game controller.Simply ""plug"" the controller into the dock using the headphone port. A provided USB cable then connects to a charging plug (not supplied) or equivalent.",5,0,2019-1-16,0,0,0
"For the money, this is a fairly well-built, well-finished charger, and stands up well in comparison with the  Sony original, which costs three times as muchThe lights for charging and docking let you check you’ve done what you intended. The charging  indicator helps you to see when the controller is fully charged. The double-slant controller holders make it easy to charge two controllers at once",4,0,2019-1-2,0,0,0
"This twin charging station features light display to indicate charge status.  Unusually the controllers sit the right way up in the charge cradle which I feel is much better than the upside down seating that many non Sony chargers use. The fit into the cradle is a good stable fit.  I have found in the past chargers that want you to seat the controllers upside down can wobble and damage the controllers  port.Overall I really like this charger but for 1 thing.  This unit has no mains power and instead uses a cable plugged into a USB port, which i know is less problematic these days with many homes have many USB ports to plug into.  My gripe has more to do with the limited ports on the PS4 itself.  So a well made good charger.",4,0,2019-1-31,0,0,0
BEBONCOOL PS4 Controller Dual Charging StationBoth remotes sit firmly on charging dock. Allows you to charge your gaming remotes ready to pick up and play when you want them.  I really like the lights that tell you when the battery needs charging and when it is fully charged and ready to use.  It comes with a cable but no plug. I have used with a USB plug and charge them from the mains.  The cable is fairly short but is a standard USB cable that you can replace easily if you require it to reach further.  Great product. Very fit for use. And looks nice.,5,0,2019-1-21,0,0,0
"My twelve year old son is forever forgetting to charge his PS4 controllers.  This leads to moaning and whinging when they start to run out of battery.  This charging dock is small, seems well made and has space to charge two controllers at the same time, one piggybacks behind the other.Admittedly you do have to use up one of the two (come on Sony!!) USB ports on the front of the console, but it's fine.  The lead is quite long so it is easy to tuck away and tidy.",5,0,2018-12-27,0,0,0

"There's very little to this charger - it's a simple docking station with connectors to charge your PS4 controllers. The base is powered by microUSB connected either directly to your PS4 or to a power socket. The charging is at a decent if modest 400mAh with overcharge protective circuitry. All of these features are pretty standard, so it's hard to get too excited about it, but it does exactly what it's meant to do and means there's less of a reason for cables across the floor charging the controllers in between game sessions.It's a perfectly good charger and considerably cheaper than official Sony merch. Well worth buying.",4,0,2018-12-22,0,0,0
This PS4 Controller Charging Dock by BEBONCOOL is a good value compact double dock that works as it should and is straightforward to use. My son used it a lot over the holiday period and found it charged his PS4 controllers fairly quickly whichever USB power source he used – no power unit is included with the dock. A handy addition to your gaming accessories this charger is particularly useful when a group is playing together as controllers can be kept ready for use. Currently around thirteen pounds from Amazon the build quality of this charger is OK at the price and should give decent service if used with a bit of care.,4,0,2019-1-13,0,0,0
"This is a fairly simple dock which comes with a USB charging cable and some minimal instructions. The dock has 2 partitions ,larked 1 and 2 so 2 controllers can be charged at one time and a USB slot. There is lights on the front which shows green or red depending on status. I have to admit I am not a gamer and this I was to tidy my son's worktop and even I can see that the worktop is tidier. He however is a dedicated gamer and rally likes this . He tells me it requires no setting up only charging and works great and is easy to useHe is pleased with it",4,0,2018-12-21,0,0,0
Hooked this up via USB to my boys PS4 and the green lights came on at the front.The controller seems to slot on easily and I haven't had any issues so far getting it to sit correctly. As soon as the controller was docked the corresponding green controller on the front turned red to show it wasnt at full battery. Once the controller is charged the light returns to green,5,0,2019-1-20,0,0,0

"This is a good value charger probably that is simple to use and looks pretty cool too. I like the display that enable you to tell which controller is ready to use, great for hardcore gamers or families with several controllers where the PS4 gets a lot of use. Getting the controllers seated can involve a bit of jiggling but that is more down to the design of the DS4 than the unit itself. Bit strange that is says it charges Pro and Slim controllers etc which may confuse some people as they are the same thing but never mind.",4,0,2018-12-29,0,0,0

"This is a useful little charging dock that charges two PS4 controllers reasonably quickly via USB. The two illuminated icons on the front display red when charging and green when fully charged.

"Plug and charge, very easy to use. USB attaches easily to the PS4, I haven't tried straight to a USB plug socket yet, but I will update when I do.

"I've got the ""sleek"" space saving model which comes with a USB cable but no power supply.

It works well enough but a mains charger would have been a useful inclusion for dual charging.",4,0,2018-12-22,0,0,0
There isn't really much to say about a charging station. The build quality is good so this should survive for a good couple of years until the PS5 comes out.The BEBONCOOL PS4 charge controller was able to charge our controllers within 3 hours. The LED indicators are large and bright letting you know the status of the controller's battery charge.,5,0,2018-12-30,0,0,0

"Broadly speaking, this charging station is very good. Pretty cheap (and therefore a little bit lightweight), but it does what it's supposed to do, and it does it in a decent amount of time. The description says it should take 3 hours to do a full charge of two controllers, but I find it's a little quicker than that.The main thing to remember is that it seems to consider the front port to be ""controller 1"", and the back port to be ""controller 2"". If you put a controller on the back port, without one on the front port, it won't charge it. The back port will only charge if there's already a controller on the front port.",4,0,2020-4-1,0,1,0

I like the look of this unit and even when the controllers are charging but one big issues is the fact it wont charge while your console is in rest mode which is when I tend to charge my controller.

"Eine sehr schöne Aufladestation. Ich hatte keine Lust, das meine Controller irgendwo verteilt rumliegen und nicht geladen sind, wenn ich Sie brauche. (Wie es bei meiner PS3 immer der Fall war) Deswegen habe ich mir diese schicke Station zugelegt. Über die Anzeige ist klar ersichtlich, on die Controller geladen sind, oder nicht.
