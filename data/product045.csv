"Purchased two 12 month PS Plus subscription voucher codes and used one at that time, then held the other for possible gift or to use later.  When I attempted to activate second voucher code it had been cancelled and Amazon refused to provide any assistance, instead requiring multiple calls to Sony and long hold times. I have now submitted a copy of the e-mail I got from Amazon to Sony support and hopefully the will reactivate the code or give me a new one, but if not it appears I have no other recourse.  If Amazon sells a product, they need to be able to resolve issues and not just finger point and pass the buck.  Very frustrating and disappointing.",1,1,2018-11-21,1,2,0
"Pretty simple, I paid for the code, put it in, ""The code you entered is inactive.  Please check terms and conditions.""Love to press the buy button and have money disappear then get nothing.",1,1,2018-10-23,1,2,1
"Hi, i just bought a code and it doesn't work, when i try to redeem the code give the next message ""The code you entered may not be correct or may no longer be valid. Please check your entry"" so need help or my money back,",1,1,2018-4-29,1,1,0
"My PlayStation 4 is a year old now and this is my second time purchasing a PS Plus code from this site. Last year, I bought a code during Black Friday and as soon as I boot up the console, I entered the code and it worked. One year later and for some reason, the code doesn't go through. I entered the 12 digit code from my PlayStation and I got the green check meaning I did everything right. However, my PS Plus didn't extend. To make matters worse, it doesn't work when I enter the code from the store's website and this was after entering it from the store via my console.As I'm typing this, my membership expired this week and I'm out $39.99 (plus tax). I doubt I can get a refund now and because of this, I don't think I can trust this site to provide me with PS Plus codes. I refuse to go through that again in 2019.",1,1,2018-12-6,1,8,0
"After purchasing, I immediately entered the code on my PS4 and it didn't work.  I tried it a few more times and still no luck.  After troubleshooting for maybe 15 minutes, I tried it again and it worked.  I believe it takes 10-20 minutes for Sony to register the newly generated code after purchasing it from Amazon. If the code doesn't immediately work for you, wait 20 minutes and try again.",4,1,2016-12-20,1,5,0
"Immediately received activation code and was able to add a year to my PSN account.  Got it for the $39 cyber monday deal.  I am giving it 3 stars though, because $59 is a ripoff.",3,1,2017-11-29,1,9,0
The product(playstation Plus membership card) itself is fine. Digital code worked flawlessly. However since I've been a playstation plus members I've noticed the benefits and content has been less and the specials dont seem to come as often or to be the higher quality games. I may give it another month or so but if it stays the same I will most likely discontinue my membership. If you use PS3 system they will be discontinuing support for in the near future from my understanding. Which is a shame due to so many out there that still utilize that very capable and enjoyable system.,3,1,2018-8-15,1,6,0
"Have been a PlayStation Plus member for years, but this one I bought for my son as a gift.  Much more affective than just adding it by credit card on his account because we printed out the graphic and put it in a card for him and he was able to add it to his own account.  Made it feel more real to him.  PlayStation Plus is well worth it.  Some of my favorite games were free from PS Plus.  Well worth it for the benefits.",5,1,2017-11-2,1,7,0
Worked perfectly fine. Most of these people rating low stars don’t even know how to follow simple instructions and seem like they don’t even understand how digital codes work. I bought it while I was on my way home from work. 20 minutes after my purchase I redeemed the code on my PS4 and guess what? It worked!Everything was smooth as butter and no issues here.,5,1,2019-3-15,1,3,1
"I don't hate anything but since Amazon's rating stars equate hate to the lowest grade, this was the only available option.It is the Playstation policy of ultra adherence to it's ""transfer"" rule, that I have a problem with. As concise as I can make this, PS will not accept my voucher because I bought  this from Amazon with My credit card. My husband then entered the # into my underage grandson's acct. which has My Husband's email address. My name is also on the account because PS required TWO signatures to allow my grandson to open the acct.  Well it seems that because my email address and my husband's address are not exactly the same, the voucher was denied. At least, I think that's the issue. PS has a VERY LONG policy list that is confusing at times and needlessly inclusive, almost everything under the sun.",1,1,2018-8-2,1,2,0
"I am no expert with electronics but I am also no dummy!  I got the code for this product, I gave it to my son on Christmas morning as one of his gifts and it actually turned out to be on his top 3 list!  He was ecstatic which made me very happy HOWEVER ... when I loaded it onto his account I made a small mistake, I put my hands up and own that it was my mistake...it seems I added it to my parent account which is linked to Amazon instead of his account which is linked to mine.That should be an easy fix I thought!  A quick phone call to Playstation (a global organization).  That should be as easy as transferring it within accounts, or cancelling it and re-issuing it or honestly as a show of good faith and DISGUSTING customer service after speaking to 3 people all in a different country that couldn't really be understood or understand me on the same day that it was mistakenly activated (not played with and trying to get something for nothing). I have been told tough... there is nothing we can do.  So my son does not have this product he can not use this product, I paid $63 for something that can never be used and my sons level of disappoint and not understanding is heartbreaking.  He does not have his Christmas gift, it will cost me another $63 to make this right and all Playstation would say is tough!!!",1,1,2019-1-4,1,1,0
Not sure why the price went up to $60 at all because the experience isnt always stellar and I dont see any improvements worth $10 more per year from their entire base.I do appreciate the free games although most of the time they arent typically games I would like to play and i still prefer Sony to Microsoft for now. Other than that you’re going to need this to play with your friends on playstation so i can especially recommend these when you can find them for $40,4,1,2017-11-6,1,2,0
"Playstation plus is a bad value. You hand over your money, and in exchange Sony.. does what? They don't host game servers (most games are still peer to peer.) They don't provide any updates beyond what non-paying customers get. The free games are almost always worth less to me than the monthly subscription cost. They don't provide any connectivity (I already pay my ISP for that.) What am I getting here? You're letting me play multiplayer? It doesn't cost you anything to do that! The only reason it's even possible for you to offer that is because you so tightly control the available software! Shame on Sony for emulating Microsoft's terrible anti-consumer ""service"" model (have to put service in quotes because no actual services are provided.)",1,1,2019-6-12,1,1,0
If I could give it zero stars I would. I bought this as Christmas gift for my son along with a PS4. I activated the membership on my parent account. I don’t play video games but I have a parent account to have parental controls over my sons account. I had no idea what I was doing and there was no support or warning that if I activated it then my son couldn’t use it. I contacted Sony support and spent hours trying to get it transferred to my sons account. Escalated to a manager but no luck. They said tough luck. Even though you bought it for your son we cannot transfer it to his account. Even though I never used it. It is a total scam and turns out the benefits aren’t even worth it even if you can figure out how to set it up right. It is a total scam. Save your money and buy your kid a real game.,1,1,2018-12-29,1,1,0
"I opted to buy this through Amazon rather than Sony in order to avoid automatic resubscribing with Sony. Doesn't work that way, you'll be automatically re-upped regardless (Sony requires a credit card as part of activating the code). Now I've got the worst of all worlds: when I entered the code into the PS4's redemption spot, I got some message saying the network was too busy, check back later. Now the code won't be accepted at all. Sony customer support chat is, apologies, total poop. Not sure how I'm supposed to return this to Amazon either, and if I'm able to, I suspect that despite not be able to access the Sony network, I'll be charged again next year for this absence of service. Total poop. If you're going join up on Sony's network, just do it through your Playstation.",1,1,2018-12-3,1,1,0
"Not much to say about this one.  You get the code very quickly, it works, and I have another year of PlayStation Plus.  I have downloaded hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of free games in the PS store as a member, which in my estimation makes this very much worthwhile. Of course it also allows for online multiplayer, but I almost never use that.",5,1,2018-1-5,1,1,0
"If you want to enjoy all the perks of gaming with friends and stranger online, this is a must get!Most triple A titles require a PS Plus subscription account in order to access the full Online Multiplayer Features of those games on the PS4.

"My wife bought me this on Black Friday last year. She assumed it worked automatically. She didn't realize I'd been paying $10 month for online access. She just recently saw the card in our 'order history.' She told me about it, so I went to activate it..... Claims it's expired even though I never used it. Total RIP OFF.",1,1,2018-11-13,1,9,0
This is a stupid product don’t buy it they don’t actually email you a code so I got ripped off DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,1,1,2018-1-12,1,2,0
I was saving it until I  ran out of ps plus and when i decided to renew the code wouldn't work. I contacted Playstation and they told me to fix it with the retailer aka amazon. It sucks because this never happened before but i definitely won't be buying these again from amazon. I only got it cause it was a great deal at the time. But that's pointless if I cannot redeem it.,1,1,2018-11-10,1,1,1
"This is the easiest way for me to add a month,  quarter or even year of membership to PS Plus without being billed automatically after the time period expires (as if I do it on the PSN). I also like how Amazon gives you a discount for being a Prime member (granted, it was only $0.04 but probably more with a larger purchase such as a year membership).Additionally, I received the code lightning fast (good, since it was an ""e-code"") and the instructions that came with it provided a very clear-cut way to redeem the code. This is important as many times I have had issues finding where to go to redeem a code but this removes all uncertainty.",5,1,2017-10-23,1,1,0
Painless way to buy if you cant get to a store.  And the discount when i got this in Amazon is not to be missed (it wasnt offered in PS Store when I got this in Amazon)  if you like the freebies that comes with being a PSplus member.  The one year is so worth it! Freebies like Metal Gear: Phantom Pain is so worth it! Always keep an eye on sales like Black Friday... Amazon thank you!,5,1,2017-11-20,1,1,0
"As per the headline, I bout one of these thinking I could use it when I had some free time and could do online interaction with my PlayStation Friends.  When I tried to input the code, it was expired.  So I had to buy it again.  Don't get me wrong, it works when you enter the code, but I figure since I paid for it they got my money and the things shouldn't expire.  Nice not having to look in stores for these.",4,1,2019-1-17,1,5,0
The Sony PlayStation customer support is awful.1) you can't call from many mobile providers without getting an error because they block VOIP numbers.,1,1,2019-7-1,1,2,0
"Not much to say, it's a three month PS Plus membership. Had no trouble activating.But of course if you have a playstation network account with billing info on it, it will still default to automatic renewal, which I was looking for ways to possibly avoid at the time of purchase. But it IS easy enough to disable auto renew if you're in my boat and don't have the stability of budget to support that, at least it is on PS4. Just go to Settings > Account Management > Account Information > Playstation Subscriptions. Select the subscription you want to cancel auto renew on, and select ""Turn Off Auto-Renew"".",4,1,2019-1-7,1,4,0

"The PS4 Plus card that I purchased through Amazon provides online gaming action, so that my grandson can play games with his cousins and friends. Purchasing the card through Amazon was very helpful because I can instantly attain the voucher number, add it to my grandson's PS4 gaming console and away he goes! I think the instantaneous availability of the voucher is what I liked most about my purchase.I cannot think of one negative aspect regarding the PS4 Plus card, nor the purchase of it. I would recommend purchasing the PS4 Plus card from Amazon to enjoy gaming right away.",5,1,2018-5-2,1,7,0

"Nothing beats instant, so when you want to get on the PlayStation Network now, this is for you. Because some folks purchasing this item may not be owners of PlayStation devices, to clarify this is a digitally redeemable code. These are used to provide a single PlayStation gamer with access to the PlayStation Plus network, which is essential for the PlayStation 4. The PlayStation 4 requires this membership to fully utilize the multiplayer capabilities of the console.Once you've provided payment info, you can be online in just seconds after purchase.

"My son has his own ps4 and wanted to renew his playstation plus membership, but the ps4 kept rejecting all of my debit/credit cards, so I got clever and found that I can do it through Amazon.After you purchase the membership Amazon will email you the voucher code that you can then take and input directly onto your ps4 through the redeem codes section on your ps4 (google for more help.)",5,1,2020-5-1,1,1,0

"Purchased two codes today and one previously. Email came within minutes with my codes. Was able to redeem them via my online account instantly. The codes will stack, so I’m covered for two years now.**If you purchased more than one code, redeem sooner rather than later. I have heard these expire within 12 months. Once they are added to your Sony account they don’t expire and the years stack. No need to wait a year to activate the next code.",5,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"Please note before you purchase this item: BE PATIENT and WAIT for your code to go through before you try to redeem it on your PlayStation account. It will go through, it just takes a little time because it's going through Amazon vs directly from SONY (which if you buy your 12 month sub during Days of Play you -can- directly purchase from the PS website usually for the same price of $39 eliminating the issue of waiting on a code to be sent to you). If you try to grab the code and immediately redeem it then it's going to kick back a redemption error on you because Amazon is still verifying through their services that it's a legit purchase/code versus blindly flinging whatever code at you. It's to cover their butt and make sure YOU get what you paid for.That being said any other errors received after waiting a while to redeem can indeed be legit errors but I'm seeing a lot of people complain about not being able to redeem their code right away. Yes, it is instant but it's not like going to the store and buying a card with a code that's already been verified as legit, Amazon/SONY have to make sure there's nothing weird going on. Just be patient and your code will come through. :)",5,1,2019-6-18,1,1,0
"I'm not 100% certain how to review this. It's a 12-month PlayStation Plus membership code. You buy it and get 12 months of PSPlus. I would recommend it for the cloud backup alone, but I guess there are some other perks too (like free games). In any case, you buy this and Amazon has a little spot where all of your digital codes live (same spot if you buy a game or other digital codes). You find the code, enter it, and call it a day. My code worked fine, no complaints.",5,1,2019-1-18,1,2,0

Type in your code and you have officially renewed your playstation plus.  I would highly recommend this.",5,1,2016-12-19,1,5,0
"This is just a solid deal. I've been PS+ since its inception and the monthly free games are my main motivator. But I use the other features too. Always try to get it on sale though--unless you are desperate and forget to re-up during Black Friday and you have a game date with Lisa that you need to use PS+ restricted features, then go for the full price. Missing out of memories with friends isn't worth the $10-15 bucks you might save.",5,1,2020-6-1,1,1,0
"I'm only getting this code because it was on sale, and I'm tired of paying full price for my PS+...after I saw some of the reviews of people not getting through to the code after paying for it, I was a little bit hesitant. I decided to take the hit and when I saw the code in my library, I was a little bit reassured, until I entered the code into my redeem code from the digital games library. Instead, I just opted to redeem though PlayStation and entered it that that way. It was a gamble for sure but I'd much rather take the gamble and pay much less than 60 for an online feature and other little stuff that SONY has to offer.",5,1,2019-7-16,1,0,0
"Now PS+ is absolutely amazing, it does a number of things right and a very few things wrong. The instant game collection always has some of the highest quality games on the market. Lately we PS Plus subscribers have been getting hit games such as Metro Last Light, DMC Devil May Cry, Bioshock Infinite, Brothers A Tale of Two Sons, Payday 2 the list goes on. This subscription fee has already payed for itself it has saved me numerous amounts of money, I now am getting games I've been wanting to purchase for some time.So you pay 50$ you get numerous amount's of high quality games, it definitely sucks when you already have said game so I can be hit or miss at times. When I first subscribed I kept getting games that I had purchased a year ago and started getting sick and tired of the service, 3 months later the subscription is now paying for itself at this point. You will also being getting extra discounts on games, indie games, DLC, wallpapers, themes and etc.... Some of these discounts can range for 1$-15$ which is pretty nice at times. You also get a few freebie/ such as wallpapers and themes that are pretty cool. And now you have the option to play several games for 1 hour to decide whether the game is for you or not. You also have cloud storage and the ability to turn on automatic updates which will update all of your games which is pretty cool and it will update your system.",5,1,2014-2-28,1,5,0

Again the purchase failed. So I bought another item on Amazon to test the credit card I was using. That purchase cleared just fine.

"$29 for a year of PS Plus? The best deal EVER. After getting screwed with XBOX Live Gold - I actually had to close a credit card because they wouldn't stop billing it after I repeatedly called and ask them to stop - I thought I was done with online game console services for good. When they announced that a paid PS+ subscription was required for online play with the PS4, I was annoyed. Not really mad, since I don't play a ton of online games, but every once in a while it's fun. I started digging in to PS+ and found out about the free games. Holy crap - that's when it made all the sense in the world to sign up for this.First off, a PS+ membership spans all of your devices, so one membership works across your PS4, PS3, Vita, and PSP. They release multiple games for each every month, and the titles are just getting better and better. Recently Tomb Raider 2013 was released for the PS3. Resogun is still one of the best games on the PS4. Outlast on PS4 is easily worth the price of a year of PS+ by itself. Bioshock Infinite and Borderlands 2 on PS3 last month. Uncharted 3 on PS3. The list goes on and on.",5,1,2014-3-22,1,1,0
I've been using PlayStation plus since 2011 and I love it! Buying the 12 month card/code is the best value because a $40 12-month code breaks down to only $3.33 a month! I stock up on the 12 month codes (over 10 years worth of codes) when the price drops down to $40 because every few years their price has raised by $10. The regular price now is $60 for 12 months but before that it was $50 and before that it was $40. They're all so great to give as gifts and I've done that quite a few times.,5,1,2019-6-10,1,2,0

When I entered it into the Playstation Store, it reported ""this prepaid card has already been redeemed""; this comment thread has many similar messages. Fear not.

Retail price is a bit steep but it periodically goes on sale during the big shopping holidays so if you can pick it up then it's a steal. Even if you are a current subscriber it will extend your subscription by the purchased amount.",5,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0
"The description is an absolute lie. ""Instant delivery"" is what you get when you use the PSN to add a PS+ subscription to your account. If you order from Amazon, you will likely wind up waiting a full 45 minutes before you get your code.I spoke with Amazon Customer Service about this. They lamely tried to tell me that my payment has to be processed before I would receive what I paid for.",1,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
"I have always bought this 12 month membership, ever since I owned my first PS3 all the up to my PS4.  I like the free games you can get each month, which makes it well worth the cost.  However, if you let the account expire, you loose all those games, until you re-up that membership.The one big thing I do not like and why I give it three stars.  In order to play online now, you have to have Playstation Plus.  I don't like that.  When I buy a game, like Overwatch or Fallout 73, I should be able to play online with or without the Plus account.  Like I said, the only draw back.  This is the reason for the three stars.  I would give it 4 or 5, if not for this.",3,1,2019-3-28,1,0,0
"If you were on a budget you could just pay for this membership and play the many games that comes with it and not be without games. They add a lot of good games (I find for me I find something interesting every few months) to the point I have a huge backlog now and am starting to worry if I'm going to fill up my PS3's hard drive (I've only been a member 5 months now). Also, you will always have access to any ""free"" games you download on PS+ as long as you are a member. So if you need to stop paying for a while (and aren't playing the games), you can pick PS+ up later and get access again to all the games you downloaded before under PS+. Think of it like Netflix but you get to play the games offline as well, no internet required to play the games you get (just internet required to obtain them and probably also every time when your sub runs out you'll need to connect once to let the game license know you are good for another year or so <- you can stack years).Also, if you have a Vita, I really can't stress that you really should subscribe. It seems that a lot of the best Vita games make it onto this membership (I've gotten Gravity Rush, Wipe Out, Uncharted, Rayman Origins all on it and that's just the Vita specific games, not even including the PSP games like GTA Tales of Liberty City. And I know Persona was on it at one time as well as Assassin's Creed).  Bad side of being a PS+ member when you have a Vita? You're going to want a large memory card of which those are super overpriced :(. But if you wait good deals come around (well at least deals that make the cards more reasonable). Like I just picked up a 32 GB for 40 bux.",5,1,2013-12-5,1,7,0
"I've been using PlayStation Plus since 2013, and I've always been happy with the service that it's provided. Getting the Free Monthly Games, and the increased Cloud Storage for saved games is really nice. The added benefit of membership is that PS Plus members can get an additional cost saving during special sales throughout the year too. The 12-month membership is the best deal too, because it's about half of the monthly subscription cost.If you're a gamer on the PlayStation, this is a must-have purchase. This is especially true for any game that requires online multiplayer, as the service is a requirement for some online gaming titles.  I'm very happy with my purchase, and I definitely recommend it.

I bought the product back in November 2017 because it was a good price and I would eventually need to renew it.  I tried using the code 11 months later and it says it will not work.

"The product is just as advertised and I find it much easier to purchase and redeem than in the PS Store. Also, I got it during the days of play promotion in June for 40 bucks, which is a steal in my opinion. The only problem really is that Sony when you buy a product in a gift card or through amazon, immediately enrolls you in their auto-renew feature for the full price of 60bucks and will automatically charge your card if you have one set up in the PS Store. Therefore, don't forget to disable this immediately after redeeming, so you are not forced to buy this again if 12 months down the line if you find you are not playing much while also assuring that you can grab any of the discounts that regularly take place. The mere existence of this default auto-renew feature makes me deduct a star.",4,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"I already have PlayStation Plus on my main PSN Account, but decided to get 1 month so I could play multiplayer for my other main PSN account. PlayStation Plus Subscriptions come in intervals of 1 year, 3 months, or 1 month.  I wasn't able to find the 1 month trial at my local store so luckily Amazon.com had it.  All I did was search PlayStation Plus, the 1 month membership came up and I purchased it.  The PSN was delivered immediately to my email address, and within seconds I was playing online. I might buy another one before the end of the year.  I only play a couple of games online, I like the cloud storage, and free games you get...which are great some months. Highly recommended for those who don't play online always and just want to test things out.",5,1,2019-8-22,1,0,0

"Like most who like Fallout, I was surprised that Fallout 76 requires a PS Plus account but good timing since Amazon has it on sale. I play both the XB1 and PS4 and hadn't been keeping an account on PS Plus. Not that I think the Xbox is better, I just don't find a lot of the free games as any interest to me but with the Fallout 76 requirement of PS Plus, I figured I might as well take the plunge. A lot of the free games they offer look like very good games. I also say the same thing about Xbox Live. At the forty dollar price you can't hardly pass it up. I'm sure they will have several free games I'll want to at least try.",5,1,2018-11-17,1,1,0
"To be honest I was a lot hesitant because of all the reviews that I read that weren't too favorable, but I still took a chance and bought it. The email prompt with the confirmation and the PSN code came within 5-10 seconds of the purchase. Then I anxiously signed on PSN to make sure that the code was legitimate, but to my dismay the code did not work and I started to panic. I then decided to follow the instructions of one of the previous comments that I had read which said that I should wait about 10 minutes before trying to enter the code, because it may take some time for Amazon to register the code. I kept busy for a while and then went back at it and at last the code went through and I breathed a sigh of relief.... ALL IN ALL, JUST WAIT ABOUT 10 MINUTES BEFORE ENTERING THE PSN CODE AND YOU WILL BE FINE!!!",5,1,2020-3-30,1,1,0
PlayStation Plus gives great games monthly (mostly) and higher discounts during sales and of course multiplayer and online saves. PS3 & Vita games won't be offered starting March 2019 but they increased online save storage from 10gb to 100gb. Hopefully they'll throw an extra PS4 game in each month as well.,5,1,2019-2-1,1,4,0
"I purchase my PS Plus during this time due to the Days of Play sales. They do stack; I am currently good until June 2022.I was reading reviews about Amazon customer service issues and I wanted to clarify somethings. If your code doesn't work, Amazon won't help and it's not because they suck or don't want to, it's because they actually can't. The codes they distribute are codes that Sony gives them for resale as a middle man. Amazon does not have to power to actually make the code work.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,1,0
Great worked perfectly.  Took me a min or two to figure out where to enter the code. U go to ps Store and scroll down to redeem codes.  Enter it and within a min it's allset and loaded on ur system.  Alot of ppl say they have to wait foe email to come.  I didn't take that route. I waited 15 mins for my order to be processed went to Amazon opened recent orders. Clicked on it.  And the code was shown there. Where I screenshot it and then added to my system.  Lil tip . Black Friday they sell cards cheaper since u can add multiple cards.  Wait and buy a few then.

"Always renew my PSPlus Membership during Prime Day. Typically saves me $20-$30 per annual membership.The only reason I give 4 stars is the instructions given on how to redeem your digital code are not very clear or intuative. First time users of this process  could easily find this confusing and even frustrating unless they are very well versed with how such digital purchases and redemtion processes typically work.

"I've had Playstation Plus for almost a year now, and it has been well-worth the money that I spent on it. You get access to 1-hour demos of games, cloud game save storage, and discounts on various titles. However, the best part is that you get a large selection of free games every month. Some previous and current titles include(d) Uncharted 3, LittleBigPlanet 2, Sleeping Dogs, Binary Domain, etc. You'll easily get your money back on the purchase if you enjoy playing games. Each month games are rotated in and out, but they will be accessible to you as long as you download them to your account and have a current Playstation Plus membership. If it runs out, the games become deactivated, but will activate as soon as you renew your subscription. You can also delete the games if you're running low on hard drive space and re-download them at a later time, even if they are out of the current rotation.I have both this and Xbox Live, and I much prefer the overall benefits of Playstation Plus. One thing that Xbox Live has that PS+ doesn't have is cross-game party chat. Aside from that, I find PS+ better in every way. Microsoft has just started giving a few free games with Xbox Live, but nowhere near the quantity and quality of the games offered on Playstation Plus. Playstation Plus membership is cross-platform, meaning if you have an active subscription, you can get free Playstation 3 games and free Playstation 4 games. They do not have separate expiration dates and you do not need to subscribe twice.",5,1,2013-12-5,1,4,0

Playstation said that they need a serial number from the card.  So, I contacted Amazon again and they did not have any additional number to provide me.  They said I should contact Playstation.  This is quite the fraud they have going here. They bounce you back and forth for hours with no help and of course digital codes are non-refundable.

Buying this digitally via amazon sounded weird to me (You can just renew it directly on PSN)  but I did it because I had a gift card I wanted to use towards this instead. I come to realize it's the same thing if you would buy at any retail store. You might get a better deal buying it here since you can use your Amazon Credits (for whatever promotion you earned) or % Cash Back.  If you don't have those then welp it's the same as buying it normally!,5,1,2018-7-14,1,0,0

"Any PS3 user should have this. It's such a great deal, I can't even lie about it. Playstation Plus is the near equivalent to Microsofts ""Xbox Live"" but with a TON of perks. You get access to a nice handful of free games every month, ranging very nostalgic ones like Crash bandicoot, to even the newer games like Dragons Dogma. They call this your ""Instant Game Collection"" because every free game goes into your account, and you basically build up your 'free game collection' the longer you are a member! And all you pay is $50 for a whole year! On top of that, you get great discounts on newer games, access to automatic updates, 'cloud saving' (Saves your games to the cloud, so you can play your saved files on other PS3's, or if your PS3 breaks, you still have access!) and Free FULL GAME trials (Play a game for an hour for free!). There's almost no reason to not get this, it's such a great value!Also, PS4 users are 'required' to get this for online play, but at that price and that sort of value, I wouldn't mind at all!",5,1,2013-12-3,1,1,0

"I've been a Playstation Plus member since it first started and have accumulated many ""FREE"" games where the membership has more than paid for itself.  This was during the PS3 era where online gaming on that console is free.  Now it's a requirement to have a Plus membership for the PS4 if you want to game online.  That's a minor con but this membership also includes games and discounts across the Playstation family of hardware: PS3, PS4, Vita and PSP.  The other thing you must understand is that these ""FREE"" games are only free and usable as long as you have a membership.  Once that expires your games will not work but any purchased games, including the discounted Plus ones, will still work since they weren't given to you at no cost.  The best way to utilize the service is to purchased it when it's on sale as I got 2 years worth last year during Black Friday and have a membership for a number of years as it stacks onto your current SEN account.",5,1,2014-4-21,1,1,0

Dont know how to rate this really. Works exactly how it says it does. I did buy it for someone else so i did have to call amazon and tell them that but they quickly just gave me a code to give the person i bought it for.

"PS+ gives the best value to it's subscribers of all the services, mainly in the free titles you get every month included with your sub. While the general price tag for it may be acceptable, I find the real value in this being when you can find it on sale. My advice is don't wait until your sub it up to try to find an additional 12 months. Grab it while it's on sale when you see it, and you can just add it onto your existing sub no problem.",5,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0

I won't preach the gospel of buying a PlayStation Plus code because you know that you need it. Every PlayStation owner should get plus for the sheer amount of free games and stuff. What I will say is this:1. You cannot redeem this code over the new PSN webstore: I just tried this not even 1 minute ago and it didn't work.

I had no way of getting to the store and I totally forgot I could just buy it on ps4 with my card, so my friend Matt told me to just cop it on amazon and it’ll give me the code right away.

Love this I don't even have to go to the store to buy it to play playstation network. In my opinion playstation plus is better than xbox live. Xbox live does not offer a lot that playstation plus does for free on the PS network on PS3 most of the stuff that xbox had it was already free before playstation plus. Anyone who wants to play online with their friends I would recommend the playstation plus because you can do so much more in as a better social aspect.,5,1,2018-4-27,1,0,0
Not worth it unless you play frequently. I don’t understand why you need to pay to play online when you didn’t used to need to do that. Not for someone who isn’t a heavy gamer. Once activated you have three months from that date before the product expires.,1,1,2019-1-13,1,1,0

"PS+ just keeps getting better.  We have a PS3 and Vita and it seems that there are always great games in the queue that we are waiting to play just as long as we are sure to check in regularly with the PS+ free games available and complete a free purchase of the new ones.  Some are games we would not have tried otherwise (and some of those we don't care to try) and many are games that we were planning to play and some are games we already own (which I promptly sell).The best part is that the games are available to us as long as we complete the free purchase and keep our PS+ membership current.  What I mean to say here is that if the game is removed from the ""Instant Game Collection"" it doesn't matter as long as I snagged it before.  I don't even have to download it, I just let the download start and then cancel it so the game is there easy to locate in my download list for when I am ready for it.",5,1,2013-12-31,1,1,0

After about two weeks, we had gotten our money's worth, and the discounts are DEFINITELY worth it.

I probably would have spent $30-$40 on a new disc copy, anyway, so I got a year.  I've barely had it a week and is already well worth it.  Free games added, great discounts on games & content, plus 1 hour game trials so you can try a game for an hour straight if you're thinking about it.  Plus Playstation Memories is free for members on the PS3.  It appears you can put game saves in a cloud for use on multiple PS3s.  I didn't do this in my house, so I'm not entirely sure.  I do different game saves on both my consoles.  The games & content is what really drew me in and now I'm just getting several GBs worth of content on my PS3 every week for free or for an inexpensive price.

"I bought this for $30 bucks during Black Friday. It was my first time getting this, and I say it was well worth it. It practically pays for itself. I also have xbox live, and I know that they do give you the game for free permanently while PS Plus lets you keep the game as long as you have the membership. However, I find that the PS Plus games are 10x better than the xbox live gold free games. Occasionally, they will give you a great game, but I prefer the PS Plus games anytime. I highly recommend it because you can basically use it for all Sony systems, and for anyone who just recently purchased a system, this can keep you entertained for a while before you spend money on more physical games.",5,1,2014-4-4,1,1,0

"I specifically bought Playstation Plus subscription because when I got my Vita I knew I wanted to get Uncharted and Gravity Rush.  Those two games alone covered the cost of my subscription and where free at the time of my subscription.  The games that you get through Playstation Plus is amazing and WELL worth the money and is an excellent gift to give someone who owns a PS3 or a PS Vita.  All the games you download/""purchase"" you can play for the entirety of your PS+ subscription.  If your subscription ends you can't play those game (the ones you bought for ""free"") again.  BUT if you get a PS+ subscription again you will be allowed to access to all your prior games you have downloaded/""purchased"" in your past PS+ subscription.  Basically make sure you ""purchase"" all the free games you can because you can play them at a later date when they are no longer listed on the PSN as free for PS+ subscribers.

When your subscription ends, so does your access to the games you downloaded, keep that in mind. Also the extras they give for you to keep, like avatar pictures or dashboard themes, are ok at best. The do not regularly update them so I have had the same free themes available since I first got PSN Plus starting June of 2013.

"PS+ is a neat service for any hardcore gamer with no issues about owning a mainly digital gaming library; yet not so great a subscription for forcefully (work, school, etc.) casual gamers who prefer to buy a disc/cartridge they can take anywhere or lend anyone, instead of a digital copy that's tied to one console (or two). So it wasn't really for me and that's why I haven't considered getting me a subscription. Yet, it was offered at $30 (plus $5 credit on some video thingie) for black friday, and I decided to check out and experience this service; and the games available from november through january have been really good so this ended up looking quite like a big bang for the buck!Next year, I'll definitely check out again for all offers available online for PS+!!!",5,1,2014-1-26,1,0,0
"This worked perfectly! I ordered the code, got it instantly, and immediately inserted it into the code redemption screen on the PS4; worked like a charm!Keep in mind, Playstation Plus will automatically renew when the year ends, charging you $50, unless you cancel that option. After putting in the code, that was the first thing I did (just go to the PS+ manage membership screen and click the cancel auto renewal button). Keep that in mind if you don't want to get charged after the year subscription ends. You can do it immediately after purchasing the code, and you won't lose anything.",5,1,2016-1-1,1,1,0

"Last year I purchased a PS Vita Bundle that came with 3 free months of PS Plus to try out.  I was very skeptical about the subscription, but I was willing to give it a go.  Thing is, I loved it so much that I purchased a full year when my 3 months expired.  Sony does a good job of routinely putting great games for free each month for my PS3, Vita, and now PS4.  Well, only a few games for free on PS4 so far, but if my Vita and PS3 are any indication, I think Sony will continue the trend.  Thing is, my game purchases have dropped significantly, so it has definitely saved me money.That being said, keep in mind that PS Plus Subscriptions stack, so you can purchase multiple subscriptions and enter all the codes at the same time and the months will accumulate--not sure if there is a limit, but I purchased another year subscription this year during the Black Friday sale where you got a year for $30.  Definitely a steal if you can get this on sale.",5,1,2013-12-28,1,1,0
"I am lucky my membership expires every year at the same day as black Friday and to be able to get it at $39.99 every year instead of the full price is even better, I do use it once in a while for online shooting games, it takes away worries or any stress that i may have during the day since I concentrate on the games, online gaming makes me forget about everything else, so this is a must have item.

"I'm sure there are features of PlayStation Plus I haven't used yet, but I'll go over the ones I do use.Free games - There are, at any given time, about 10 or 15 free full-length games available digitally to subscribers. These are changed regularly and have included big names like Street Fighter, Darksiders, Mega Man, Little Big Planet, Ratchet and Clank, etc. You could amass a pretty decent collection just in free games, especially if you're a casual gamer. You only get to use those games while you're a paid subscriber, but the price makes it well worth it.",5,1,2013-3-22,1,0,0
"I've seen a few reviews where people claim that this doesn't work, but after trying it I'm inclined to believe that they either were experiencing technical difficulties on their end or they may have been doing something wrong without realizing it.  I purchased my code while at work and was able to get the code instantly, I wrote it down as I would not be able to try it until I got home about an hour and a half later, but when I did get home and entered the code it worked fine instantly.Also, for anyone upset about the $59.99 version of this product, I did a little research and it seems that Sony did increase the annual cost of their 1-year memberships to $59.99 in general sometime back around August/September 2016, so it appears that stores such as Amazon and Best Buy who still have some of the $49.99 cards/codes in stock are still able to sell them alongside the new/more expensive ones until they sell out.  So if you want to save $10, go ahead and get your $49.99 1-year cards while you still can.",5,1,2016-12-29,1,1,0

"For an avid Playstation user, getting the PS+ seemed like a no-brainer decision.  You get a nice selection of free games each month (top favorites from the past include Battlefield 3, Uncharted 3, Ratchet and Clank: All for One, and Darksiders), excellent discounts on PSN games to buy, free trials on some of the hottest new games, the ability to conduct automatic updates, and many more bonus features.The value gained from the 12-month subscription of Playstation Plus definitely exceeds the asking price in my opinion.  The free games each month alone will certainly add up to the price, even if you don't own the rights to the actual game after your subscription expires.  In most cases, you'll be able to play the game as long as you want and complete it without having to deal with buying the game and then trying to resell it back.  Another factor to consider is how PS+ will be integrated into the next-generation PS4 console, allowing users to play online.  By purchasing your 12-month subscription to PS+ now, you will be able to transfer that over to your PS4 if you are like me and plan on getting the new console as soon as it is released.  Therefore, allowing instant access to all the great features mentioned above along with the rights to play online right when you get your PS4.",5,1,2013-8-16,1,1,0

Yes, you have to maintain your subscription to play them, so they are more like rentals - but still, any games I intend to play years down the road I'll buy a physical copy of, and I don't see myself not subscribing as long as my PS3 is my primary console.",5,1,2012-12-24,1,0,0

Purchase was pain free.  Took code upstairs to Grandkid and he paused his game and went to PlasStation store and entered the code and got the subscription confirmation instantly.

Since being a member I've acquired so many games, that I just don't have time to play them all.

Also, you don't get to choose the games, so some games will just naturally not be interesting, and when prioritizing your time you won't choose them. The uploaded saving feature is a good idea.

The vita really only has the same big games on it since I got plus a half a year a go, but gets a few minis or a psp games here and there. Really it's more like a nice bonus.If you have a ps3 with a hard disk that's at least 120+ gb you'll get your money's worth.

You get anywhere from two to three FREE games each month, more if you have more than one Sony console, and you get to play online with your friends.  The free games add up and they're usually anywhere from $5 to $15, so I think within a year this pays for itself in free games alone.",5,1,2016-3-10,1,0,0

Yes, people think of it as a ""rent""(because went the subscription is over and you dont renew you cant play those games anymore until you buy PS+ again), but if you continue to pay, especially with PS4(because you have to pay to play online MP) you'll have those games and continue to get more games all the time.

"Great value if you want to have a subscription based gaming experience. I do not care for having a bunch of game boxes laying around, or do I care about playing games right when they launch. This service has provided me with enough free games to build a decent backlog (I game roughly 10 hrs a week on average). The quality of the free games are wonderful, I have only experienced a handful of them over the past 2 years that I have not personally enjoyed. If you own more than 1 PS system (I own PS3 and VITA) there is no reason not to own PS Plus.",5,1,2015-9-25,1,0,0

Pretty standard PlayStation Plus membership. 5 stars for the $40 Black Friday Deal on Amazon. Membership is pretty much mandatory with most games on PS4 (or at least to get the most out of them) so this certainly lessens the financial blow a bit. Buy 2 if you can!,5,1,2018-11-27,1,0,0
Best deal ever on Amazon!! Beats buying from PlayStation Store for $59.99. Instant code delivery after you buy and I use right away on my PS4 when I got the code so it works for me! Til next year renewal again. No regrets!,5,1,2017-11-22,1,1,0

I don't like that you have to buy a membership to get online on the PS4 but, this is the best deal I found with easy access. I definitely recommend if you like to shop online and want to save on gas money.",5,1,2016-1-7,1,0,0

"If you own a PS3, PS4, or Vita, it's worth the purchase. Obviously after the year is up any of the ""free"" games you've downloaded will not work, but it's worth the investment to have for the sole reason that there are new games each month, and some that are worth having in an instant collection, such as Sleeping Dogs, Borderlands 2, Bioshock Infinite, etc.I bought this during the Black Friday for a discounted price of $29.99. Regularly it's $49.99. When my subscription ends around Thanksgiving, I'm sure this deal will pop up again, so it's worth noting that because it's a pretty good deal.

If you own more than one Playstation device (Vita, PS4, PS3) then you will get even more value out of this membership since you only have to have one membership for all devices. I wish that Sony would take away the PS Plus ads once you subscribe, but that is my only complaint.",5,1,2014-1-13,1,0,0

The only things I will warn you about is the fact that you should go for the year subscription if you are serious about using PS Plus, for it will save you money in the long run. Also make sure you have plenty of hard drive space, because Sony gives plenty of awesome free games each month for download! With just this 3 month pass (and only a month into it) I have gotten 5 free games, each of which cost anything from $15 to $60. YOU WILL NOT BE LET DOWN BY THIS!",4,1,2014-2-5,1,0,0

This is one of the best things you could own for your Ps4 as it gives you access to special deals and free games each month. It also gives you access to play online games and sometimes they give out free add-ons to some games you just have to keep an eye out.,5,1,2018-12-7,1,0,0
When PS Plus first launched I purchased a year and did not get too many great games that fit me. Now that has changed on PS3 you get at the time of writing Bioshock Infinite free! That is a AAA title that is a must play in my opinion even if you do not like Bioshock 1 or 2 like I did. This is ironically more favorable for gamers who own both PS3 and PS4 as opposed to just a PS4 as the games that are free on PS4 are mediocre. You also have Uncharted 3 currently to download for free and Borderlands 2. Hopefully the trend continues with AAA games every 2-3 months which would make it reasonable. I stocked up on Black Friday. You can also get them cheaper through some auction sites.,4,1,2014-1-21,1,0,0
"This is probably the #1 best way to buy these. I'm too lazy to go to a retail store and buy them. Not only that, I do not trust SONY to have my credit card information since they have already charged me twice when I never purchased anything (apparently it's an automatic renewal of the membership). I purchased this, immediately received my code, and plugged it in to the ""Redeem Codes"" area and reactivated my membership. It's so easy and convenient to use, and I'll be buying more of these when I run out.",5,1,2016-5-10,1,1,0
"I am not into memberships or subscriptions, but my brother recommended this, so I looked into it.  I have been hooked since.  In my opinion this is a great value.  The free games every month pay for the membership.  I originally thought that the free games would be lame, but they are not.  I have been playing almost every one of them.  Even if you do not happen to like the free games, the discounts are tremendous.  I have not bought a hard disc video game in about a year, and with all the free games waiting for me on my hard drive, I am not sure when I will be buying another one.  Ok, well, maybe I might just buy Assassin's Creed IV Gold Edition, but that is probably about it.",5,1,2014-3-22,1,0,0

"If you have a PlayStation 3, Vita, and/or PlayStation 4 and don't have PlayStation+, you're doing it wrong. The number of quality games I have on my backlog that I've received via PS+ is embarrassing in its excellence and scope. Of course, on the PS4, you'll need PS+ to play online (not the case on the PS3 or Vita), but that's very much a side consideration for me, not being of the online playing ilk.

I've been pretty happy with the sales they offer plus members as well.  You do lose access to the free games if your time expires (purchases stay with you) but I don't plan on cancelling any time soon.  Memberships also stack so if you find a good deal it's worth grabbing a couple. The code purchase itself was easy and I was up and running in no time.",5,1,2014-4-9,1,0,0
"Got it on sale, but even at regular price having the chance to download new games each month makes the membership a good value.  I suppose if you are a hardcore gamer who wants to be an expert on one or two titles, this may not be for you.  For a casual gamer like me, who likes variety and who doesn't mind a little bit older or less popular games, you can get more ""play"" for the price of a single top-tier game.

There are some other minor features, like cloud game saving and automatic downloading of updates that are just the icing on the cake.

"What can i say about about this item? It's a great deal for 12 months of free games for your PS3, Vita, and PS4. As long as you continue to have a PS Plus subscription, you can play any games that you downloaded in the past even if it's no longer available through playstation plus. So it's a good idea to download games that are on playstation plus ASAP before they are no longer available even if you don't plan to play that game for a while. The games they offer are pretty good and they rarely offer cheap or outdated games. There were many instances where I bought a game for full retail price only to have it available on PS plus in a couple months such as Soul Sacrifice, XCOM: Enemy unknown, Dragon's Dogma, Borderlands 2, etc.. Also, with the Ps plus membership, you can buy games for a heavy discount that you keep permanently. For example, after only a couple weeks after Muramasa Rebirth released on PS Vita, it was on sale for PS plus members for over 50% off. Now with the release of PS4, you need this membership to play online games. PS Plus is a great value for your money and I believe you don't need to buy any new games as long as you have PS Plus membership. So it's great for parents that buys their kids new games every month for 60$, and instead they can just buy this every year and enjoy countless AAA quality games.",5,1,2013-12-2,1,0,0

The free games you get every month is.  Every month you get several free games for each system.  The PS3, PS4, and the Vita all get free games.  I'm not talking crappy games (though some are) but big releases in some cases, older big releases but top games none the less.  Even if the game doesn't appeal to you, grab it anyways and give it a try.  It's free and who knows, you may like it.",5,1,2015-5-28,1,5,0

The free games alone are far more than worth this miniscule subscription rate.

Very good purchase! When you buy this it gives you the ability to play with other people online. It also gives you discounts and 2 free games every month. The games that come free are usually very good games worth downloading. So far the best games I've downloaded was Drive Club and Rocket League. Very fun to play with my friends!!! Also don't bother purchasing your Plus membership in bits like 3 months at a time. I originally did that but I realized that you waste money and time on not buying this year card. Buy this now!!

This is another one of those things I call a necessary evil. Gotta have it if you want to play online on the PS4. I added a star because you get some really good games to access while you have it. PS+ consistently has a better selection of free games to play each month compared to my Xbox Live subscription that gives me much older games.

"If I had access to my PS3 this would be awesome, It really does give out at least on big game a month and always has some classics like the infamous games.  but i'm currently only a vita player and the PSN account just isn't good enough.  I got the plus account because i want to play Gravity Rush for the Vita and it cost $35 while the plus account only cost $17.99.  It was cheaper and i also got to play a few other games for free as well.  For my 3 months with it it was worth it, simply to play gravity rush, but now that i've finished it and i alread own uncharted, there really isn't anthing elses it offered that blows my mind and i simply see it as a moey pit.  I was thinking about the deal playstation had, buy one year, get 3 months extra but i couldn't justify it for my vita alone.  That said, if i had my PS3 with me, i'd buy it in a heart beat, this month alone would pay for it for me, Spec Op front line, Infamous 2, Lord of the Ring, and Little Big planet 2 all games i've been curious about, but hven't actually picked up.  So, if you have a PS3 and Vita its totally worth it, if you only have a PS3, still justifable, only a vita... not worth it unless you do what i did and make sure it has the game you want to play and make sure the cost is lower then the actual game price then it's worth it.  but thats about it.",4,1,2013-3-10,1,4,0

"Since I own a Playstation 4 and do regular online gaming this was a must, but having Playstation plus far exceeds the ability to play online. Since I own a PS3 as well I receive free games every month which is fantastic! I don't always play them, but having the access to them is great. The indie games that usually come along with the PS4 every month are usually worth giving a try. They defiantly have merit which is good, and they don't tale themselves too seriously which is great for a game. They're just casual fun which I love. The discounts that come with being a playstation plus subscriber are insane! I don't usually buy games from the playstation network, as I see no purpose and would prefer the hard copy much more, but just seeing the discounts they provide are an added bonus. Playstation plus is simply amazing and if you'd like to get the most for your money I suggest buying the year.

As someone who paid for Xbox live in the past and was skeptical about paying to be able to game online I decided to give psn a chance. The result was immediate satisfaction sure you don't need this service to be able to play on psn with others but it def makes the experience a bit more rewarding. The network makes the customers feel appreciated in a way I never felt with the xbox. You get free games monthly as well as discounts spread out through the year. I've noticed that around the holidays they truly show their customers how much they appreciate them by offering awesome deals.

Free games that constantly updated! Great discounts! And beta access when there's new games arriving! PS Plus is like unlocking the full potential of your Playstation device (I currently own a Vita and a PS3)!  Such a great library of free games with new ones arriving all the time and accessible for weeks (or if you download it once it'll be accessible from your downloads for as long as you keep PS Plus membership)!

"Short and sweet, it's awesome. When I bought the PS4 I knew that I in going to need playstation plus. Obviously you get a much better deal when you buy a year so u might as well drop the $50 right when u buy your PS4. However, with that said if you have a playstation vita, as I do, playstation plus is also amazing. You get acess to lots of solid games for free or at a discounted price (just word of advice, buy a big memory card to hold all of your new games). If you have never owned a playstation device and don't know what PS plus is then you should read a few more reviews or watch some youtube videos to get some information. If you can find a person that didn't like playstation plus then I will be surprised because it is great. Just do yourself a favor and buy it. PS plus is a fantastic service that you will need anyway for the PS4",5,1,2013-12-31,1,0,0

Finally broke down and bought this. Great decision. The instant game collection has totally opened my eyes to games I would likely never go out and purchase and not just the amazing free ones but the + prices for the ones you pay for. My budget is tight right now so being able to get new GOOD games (some great wink wink BIOSHOCK Infinite) that I can just download and play helps me significantly.Very pleased I did this.,5,1,2014-1-31,1,0,0

"I bought the plantation membership on amazon because playstation would not allow me to use my credit card directly through them. after about 30 mins of frustration I decided to buy the card and just plug in the numbers. even though this wasn't much cheaper, it was a lot easier to use  and you don't have t worry about it automatically resubscribing after the 3 months are up. after you make the purchase you are given a digital code that you enter directly into your playstation and its activated right away. this is the only way I will purchase monthly membership for playstation in the future",5,1,2018-3-12,1,4,0

This essentially gives you tons of games over the course of a very short time. I have had it for only a couple of months and I have gotten almost 30 games that I would never have gotten because of how expensive they are. The games aren't low rating or low selling games either. These are highly regarded games and best sellers. It also allows you to play betas for games before they are released to the public and cloud storage for game saves. As a added bonus it gives you even more added cloud storage and even more free games for the PS Vita. This service alone brought me back to using my playstation 3 over my xbox 360. I am a very happy customer.,5,1,2013-1-24,1,0,0

"Exceptional value, as it includes a monthly roster of free games for three Playstation systems. Also, being a member qualifies you for some additional discounts in Playstation Store sales.

"This card its an excellent way to try the PSN+ Advantages, this will save you money by the fact that there are a lof of good games that you get for free, some might not be as fun as you think but to try some games it's really good, you will get more for what you paid.  Just take this in count, everygame that you get for free with PSN+ will be working just while u have the suscription, once this is gone, you wont be able to play them, unless you renew.  Thats the only catch of this cards, all the games with discount will work, except for the free games.  So far this have worked fine, since i've downloaded good games for free, i've purchased with discount some other games.  This help you with some free games that you migh want to play just once and then forget about them.  It's cheaper than buying the disc, altho some games are not available through PSN+ (like Gran Turismo, God Of War, Sims 3, and some others.)  and you can only get them through physical disc, not digital, for all other games, this card will be your window to the best games.",5,1,2012-12-25,1,0,0

"In the past PS3\PS4 Plus membership was revelent only if you wanted to play co-op game play.  Today Play Station Plus offers far more than access to co-op play.  I like the ease of storing game stats and progress information online.  I like the free games you get.  You get just enough free games in a year subscription to make the $50 investment pay off in my estimation.  The Sony Playstation Plus membership is not forced on you with the heavy handed big brother threat, fear and fire wall function feature barrier tactics used by other gaming systems.Sony has a better system in the PS4 and it also has a superior incentive driven system that for my money appears more friendly and customer centric.  My Playstation Plus experience last year was so much fun that I gladly re-enlisted in the Playstation Plus army once my first tour of duty was up.  I found a partery $50 a small price to pay for all the fun moments Playstation Plus Membership gave me over the past year.  I don't usually go in for value added services because; they are usually short on value.  I am not a co-op gamer being autistic I have few friends to game with online.  I love video games but, I have cerebral palsy, autism and other disabilities so my game play skills leave me barely able to survive in the easy games.  Hard video games I leave on the shelf forever.  Playstation Plus gives me additional ways to enjoy video games I am able to play.  Playstation Plus gives me games I can play FREE or at steep discounts.  Playstation Plus lets me preview a game which lets me see if it is a game I can play even with my disabilities BEFORE I sink big money into buying the fully unlocked version.",5,1,2014-12-19,1,1,0

Gave me a bit of an issue with PSN down when I bought/downloaded but really this is no problem at all. I avoided having to put in paypal and/or credit card data to purchase games I may want. Best used when the system isn't overloaded like during the holidays.

"The Card works fine I assure you since after countless(无数的) tries I was finally able to punch(开洞) it in successfully without any error, the problem is the PSN Store and NOT THE CARD!! The server is overloaded with the amount of people on it who JUST LIKE YOU purchased this AMAZING DEAL. The server was overloaded and cannot handle this much requests at the same time. I ASSURE YOU THAT WITHIN 24 HRS IT WILL BE FINE (for U.S). For now just write down your code and keep it somewhere safe and try it later. If your as persistent(固执的) as me then keep going at it and you might get lucky if the server chooses you, lol. The server is overloaded and this the reason it's displaying that error.This is why I Prefer Amazon rather then any other of the retailers, I mean who wants to get trampled(践踏)??

In less than 10 minutes, I made back the total amount paid for the 3 month subscription and then some by getting one free great game! Trust me, you're wallet will be happy.",5,1,2012-11-22,1,2,0
"Playstation Plus is basically Xbox Live. You buy the card ($50) and you can play Playstation games online. BUT, there is an added benefit. You get around 6 games a month for free! As of writing this, you receive 2 PS4 games, 2 PS3 games and 2 VITA games. These vary in quality but you'll never receive anything terribly awful. PS4 games so far are just indie games as of right now, but they're generally decent. There is typically a AAA quality game thrown in with the PS3 selection as well.

PlayStation Plus is a questionable purchase if you don't play online much. The free monthly games can be worth it but lately Sony's offering in this department have been lackluster. It's best to look for discounted PS+ subscriptions on the web.  I bought this during Amazon's sale on the subscription and got it for $39.99 around Christmas time.  If you don't play online much but want the free monthly games just wait for a sale here or take a look around.,4,1,2016-1-25,1,0,0

"If you own a Playstation system that can access the internet (beofre the PS4 at least) then you already enjoy free online gaming access. This membership on top of that brings so much more to the table. With it you get discounts for being a member on various things store wide including games, movies, tv shows and music. You get exclusive early access to lots of demos. You get access to game betas long before anyone else. Lastly, you get a crap ton of free games. This membership was the main reason behind my buying a PS Vita. After 7 months being a member I had more than 15 Vita/PSP games downloaded on my PS3 and no handheld to play them on. I also received several choice AAA titles for free. Within the first month of being a member, the amount of free games I received more than paid for the membership. What I would have paid for those games new at retail or or downloadable would have easily cost me 4 times what the membership cost. If you have a PS3/Vita/PSP or upcoming PS4 then you should have this. I playin all gaming sandboxes (Wii/PC/Xbox 360, etc.) and this value easily trumps Xbox Live in which you get none of these perks with a gold membership.",5,1,2013-10-28,1,1,0

"My nephews have played games for years but thought the Plus membership was dumb. I read about the accounts here online and decided to take the plunge and ordered the membership for them as a Christmas gift. When my nephew received it he kind of turned his nose up at it (he wanted a particular game instead.) However, once he actually booted up his system and entered the code he discovered several free downloads available. Since Christmas I have gotten several texts and phone calls telling me how great it is to get different ""free games"" each month... and when NBA2K14 showed up on a free download in May he about lost his mind. (That one game has a price tag more than double what I paid for the membership code on sale last holiday season.I highly recommend the purchase for anyone with kids, nephews, grand kids, etc. It truly is a gift that keeps on giving all year long.

"Here's my opinion on Sony's ""Playstation Plus"" subscription. I really don't like the fact that they said membership will ""always be free"". To me, membership means that you get ALL the perks. That being said, if you don't play for the subscription, you don't get to play online. Maybe some games you do, but the majors you won't. Of course, for me, that's not a huge deal, because I rarely play online, if ever. But that's not the point. The point is, they said it would always be free and now it's not. Don't get me wrong,...I understand Sony's switch to paid because at the same time you have Microsoft charging for Xbox Live and that's doing HUGE numbers, so it only makes sense?! Now, that's my problems with it. My LOVE for PS Plus is the FREE GAMES idea! (this also forced Xbox to add their ""games with gold"" problem to it's subscription). The free games and discounts alone are worth the money for the subscription! It also runs across all Sony platforms!",4,1,2014-2-7,1,1,0

"I have hesitated in having to purchase something ""subscription"" (i am cheap when it comes to that), but I purchased this for one main reason, it grew to more once I had it. The main reason is this: For  roughly $4/month, you can automatically upload your game saved data. That is a huge deal, imagine how much time you spend on a game to get to a certain level. Even someone making minimum wage would easily go past $100 worth of their time to get to some higher level. Imagine a gamer, who has several games. As you can see, it already makes sense. So that is the main reason. Then you can download and play several games while you are a member, some games worth more than $40, I must have downloaded almost $100 worth already in my first night. So that is my ""growing"" reason(s). I am sure there are more reasons to come, but for anyone looking to get it, I think it is worth the money.",5,1,2013-3-5,1,0,0

Great if you want to play with others online. Paying monthly is not worth it. The 50 a year is a great deal. Also getting 3 different trial/betas or full games every month. Though at times all or some not worth it..plus discount on some items is nice too. Though don't always go by the plus deals tab. There have been times I found good discounts on a game I wanted though it would not show up on the list. I just happened to type it in and it happened to have a plus offer.

"$50 for 12 AAA Titles every year and access to an expansive library of great an interesting titles? Take my money! Granted, you have to continue being a PLUS subscriber to access the games they offer to you as a member but with enough people demanding a change, Sony will compensate.

"It's hard to beat Playstation's PLUS system. I mean, there's always playing online for free on PC but when it comes to consoles, it's the best. $40 for a full year (on sale of course) or $50 at the most is not much at all for what you get. That's $4.16 per month when purchased at the full $50 price. That's 2-4 free games per month on PS4 alone, 8-12 games total between Vita, PS3 and PS4. That pays for itself within the first month of subscription. On top of that you gain access to the online gaming and while this shouldn't necessarily cost anything, it's definitely not a bad price since it does. Sony could charge a lot more and people would still pay so I'm cool with the current price. Even more than that, they give you discounts on games digitally which adds up to quite a bit if you buy a lot of games, movies and so on. I'm starting to ramble a bit here so I'll leave it at this: PS Plus is a great service. Especially for the low cost of $4.16 a month or less.

"I decided to purchase this 1 year Plus membership at my sisters recommendation. We had it for 8 months now so I can give an accurate review.  I love that you are able to get 2 free games to download per month that you can keep as long as you maintain the plus membership.  Some games are kinda cheesy, but we have gotten a few games that my elementary aged boys have absolutely loved.  Actually the most played game on our PS4 is the Tabletop Racing game that was one of the free monthly downloads.  I usually download the games monthly when they the new games are made available.  Unfortunately, I did forget a couple of times so I don't know what I missed. There is usually a title that is more adult/mature in nature, and one that is more family friendly. At roughly $4 a month, this a good deal.  I will definitely be buying an additional 1 year membership when this one expires.  I preferred buying this from Amazon so I didn't have to register my credit card with Sony.  I just had to enter a code according to the directions to activate.",5,1,2016-10-14,1,1,0

"I've always liked the idea of PS Plus, but wasn't sure I would use it... I was a little hesitant to shell out cash for any kind of add-on to an already-expensive system. But the more I read about it, the more intrigued I became. I took the plunge about a year and a half ago, and never regretted it. Every month there's new free content (which by itself pays for the subscription many times over), plus you get pretty good discounts on brand-new titles and DLC. There's enough content to keep you checking back at least every few days, and enough gameplay to keep you (or any other gamers in your house) occupied for months.

"I'm a microsoft fanboy, I've had gold for years, bought the 360 at launch, and have earned most of my chievo's there. PS3 was my console for PS3 exclusive games, anything that was multiplatform I bought on 360. But then this april PSN had a deal netting you a few more months of PS+ with a year purchase. The amount of free games you get is ridiculous. Every month there's plenty of games, and knowing that I'm also getting vita games for free, really makes me want a vita. Just because I ALREADY HAVE GAMES. How could you not want a device for your free games. PS+ has really made me move more towards my PS3 as my go to device for everything.

It's great that there's a service for PS3 and PS Vita that adds so much more to their online service, PSN, that's already wonderful (and free) to begin with. Highly recommend!",5,1,2013-4-5,1,0,0
"At first i though what a drag, having to buy this (i got the vita after the ps3, and now ps4) but its essential and considering the games and other freebees you get while you're ""plus""; its a steal. You won't regret it.",5,1,2014-6-5,1,1,0
"Overall, PSN has a far way to go to catch up to the pay to play model in the software department. I love my PS3, 360, Wii and PC. I am indeed a collector and I can say that PSN+ is a ""wait n see"" model at the moment. I am not likely to keep paying into this without it being more customer/user end supportive from Sony. For one; communication features need a huge update before one should consider PSN+. Both Live and PSN have free ways to game, but Live is almost decade ahead in both subscribers and mostly software for their pay model. I'm happy to have tried this out early on and can say that its up to you if you should wait or game on, and pay Sony to speed it up. Lets hope PSN+ becomes more 'user-friendly'.Either way you put this. Hacks or no hacks; remembering Sony's earlier fallibility back around march of this 2011. Regardless on any platform; at least the methods offered here allows you to use 'pay pal' or buy through 'Amazon' itself instantly with your card and save. 5/5 to Amazon! & 3/5 to PSN+ of current time.",5,1,2011-10-1,1,4,0

"I bought this when it became apparent that the free PS3 games I would get would more than make up for the yearly standard subscription price.  When I factor in having a PSP with a 32 GB card, a PS3 with a 1 TB HDD, a Vita with a 64 GB card, and a PS4 with a 500 GB HDD that I'll eventually upgrade to >1TB, it's now worth more to me than ever as free games for all of those systems make their way into the rotation (PSP games are rare these days, but not unheard of).  The PS4 free games have been slow, but it's still quite new and there aren't many games in general yet for that system.If you only own a PS4, this might be more of a 4 or even 3-star product:  it's required to play games online for the PS4 only, and as mentioned the free games are kind of thin at the moment.  But if you own a PS3 or Vita (with substantial free space on your storage device) it's probably worth the price; if you own multiple systems, it's a solid 5-star service.",5,1,2014-1-25,1,0,0

"PlayStation Plus is REQUIRED for online-play on the PS4, but not on the PS3. If you're going to play online games on your PS4, then PSPlus is a necessity. Nothing really to say about it as if a review couldn't describe, but PS Plus is pretty great as a service. Every month across each Sony console (PS3, PS4, and PSVita the handheld) you get free games. Yes, FREE games every single month as a PS Plus Member. Generally it's a mixed bag of indie games + some AAA games (examples: Sleeping Dogs, Hohokum, Borderlands 2, Gravity Rush, among others) that are free to play so as long as you keep your PS Plus membership. When your membership expires you'll lose access to online play on PS4, and the free games you've downloaded, but just renew your membership whenever you want and any content you'd gotten prior will be accessible again.Suffice it to say that the only thing you should be worried about with PSPlus is making sure you get the best deal, or if you're concerned with putting your credit card on the console for security reasons, having the PS Plus as a code (you'll enter it through the PS Store on the console) you won't have to worry about that.",4,1,2015-6-2,1,0,0

Playstation plus allows you to download free games which you keep as long as your have the membership. AAA titles such as Bioshock Infinite and Tomb Raider are available along with discounts.

"I am a serious gamer and I have both major consoles (PS3 and Xbox 360). I thought I would have a go at the Playstation Plus network after being an Xbox Live Gold member for many years. The value I get from the Playstation plus is much better in terms of actual CONTENT. I am not taking shots at Microsoft and I certainly don't consider myself a 'fanboy'. Gaming is a hobby for me and its how I decompress. This is a simple truth.There are stunning AAA games to be downloaded every month absolutely free of charge for PS+ subscribers and the hits just keep coming. I am kicking myself because I should have done this much much sooner. As soon as Sony invests in seriously beefing up the online game play experience and reduce the wait time loading the Playstation network, Microsoft is going to be in very serious trouble. Anyone who uses gaming to seriously decompress should get Playstation plus.",5,1,2013-10-17,1,3,0

"The code arrived in under 10 minutes which was quicker than I expected. Code was working just fine and I had no issues registering it into my PSN account. In my honest opinion no one should pay anything higher than 50 dollars for this so I would wait for any deals that come up which is very often. As cliché as it may sound I miss the good old days when online gaming came free and paid dlc was rarely ever heard. Although when you think about it charging for online services makes some sense since they need staff and equipment to run servers smoothly (although servers being down is not uncommon). I just feel like the 60 dollor price tag for a year of ps+ is asking for too much. The pros of ps+ is the 2 free ps4 games and online gaming but the free games are rarely ever hyped up games so don't get your hopes up, expect a lot of indie titles.

"Playstation raised the price of this 12-month membership by $10 just a month ago. Amazon still has the old and cheapest price available anywhere here in the U.S.So this was a no-brainer. In terms of PlayStation Plus membership, there are all kinds of opinions out there if it is worth it or not. For me, it is, because you get two free games every month. Yes, some of the games are not that good, and most of them you don't even want, BUT still, I like to be open-minded and try new things.

You only get to keep the games while you are a plus member, so make sure you play them before anything you actually own or keep your subscription up.

"I only have a PS3, so I am not required to buy this for online play.  Even so, I think the PS Plus membership is one of the best 50 bucks I have spent.  The free games every month are huge.  Many of the titles are games I wouldn't normally purchase, but that doesn't mean they aren't fun and enjoyable.  Plus, every once in a while you get a pretty sweet triple-A game which is awesome for people like me who bought a PS3 late and are still building their collection.  There are additional features as well (online storage, automatic updates, etc.), but the free games were the big draw for me.  With just a PS3, I get at least two games a month, working out to just over $2 per game.  For those who have a PS4 and PS Vita, there are a total of 6 free games per month which is obviously an even better deal.  Do keep in mind, these games are only accessible for as long as you are a PS Plus member, but if you find this membership as valuable as I do, you'll be a member for a loooooong time.",5,1,2015-11-3,1,0,0

"Not bad, but PS Plus can be hit and miss. At times there are good deals, free games, etc., at other times the discounts/free games are weak at best. It's unfortunate that membership is required for online play, as this was not forced on previous PS generations. With that said, as a systems admin I do understand the cost behind online play--it's not cheap to keep servers among other things running under load. However, Sony made a mistake here by back pedaling and now handing the cost of upkeep to the players. The sales of consoles and games have accommodated for this previously, and this has never been a factor for PC gaming (minus subscription-based games), so it's odd that Sony adopted the XBox ways.",2,1,2017-3-29,1,1,0

"Before the price-hike to $60 earlier this year, the PS+ subscription offered very poor value, even at its' previous $40 pricing (and even at $30 sale pricing during that period imo).  I've been a paying subscriber to this service for 4 years, and strongly believe that online multiplayer should either be free (as it was for many years during the PS3 era) or at most, maybe $10 to $15 per year.  Unfortunately, the amount money I've spent on this service above and beyond that amount only makes me feel like I'm constantly subsidizing the development of the countless ""free"" trash-tier digital indie games that are offered month after month (after month..).  Occasionally, there are truly good to at least okay titles offered (Rocket League still stands out), and I honestly don't mind the rare occurrence that an older AAA title is included, even if I've already purchased it.  But all of these ""free"" games are only free for as long as you remain a paying PS+ subscriber, and so long as you go to the Playstation Store each month to ""purchase"" and checkout these titles (which again, is just a constant disappoint imo).  Other benefits of PS+ include various discounts on digital purchases at the Store (which I have never used, as I only purchase physical media) and online storage for game saves (which I do appreciate, but have never needed).  And lastly, I do enjoy playing multiplayer from time to time, but very rarely anymore - and absolutely not enough to justify spending $60/yr so I can play whatever game some random weekend 3 months from now.SONY (SCEA/SIEA), please closely reevaluate your current service and the value that it offers your customers, and strongly consider offering a yearly PlayStation Plus (multiplayer-only) subscription for a reasonable $10/year fee that does not include ""free"" games that many of us do not want, and without the PS+ discounts that many of us will never use.  There is really nothing else you could possibly offer to add additional value to the service at it's current price, that will be appreciated by all (ie, free/discounted PS Now, PS Vue, etc).",1,1,2017-11-11,1,6,0
