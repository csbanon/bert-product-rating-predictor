7089,Simple to place in not a fan of the pull arm style of fan but it does the job when upgrading CPU's. You also gotta update your bios before installation of new CPU,5
166412,"Its nice.  A small little dock for two controllers, plugged it in and with no controllers on it both lights came on green.  Not discouraged I plugged in both controllers hoping to see them turn red.  Didnt happen.  Powered on one controller in the dock, battery indicator was not blinking indicating charing.  Unplugged usb from base bad plugged into controller its self low and behold....it charges....try the dock again and nothing.  Why would a company continue to make something THEY KNOW DOES NOT WORK?  Extremely disappointed I wasted my young nephews (9) xmas gift to me on this.  He was very proud to give me the 10 dollar amazon gift card he worked himself doing chores for his neighbors.",1
187360,"I really like these, purchased one for each garage door and works great on my Android cell phone.  Have now had these several months and am still very happy with them.  They work great with my cell phone.",5
103881,"I have several Ring products and this one integrates well, and surprisingly doesn't blow through batteries. I'm sure other peoples mileage will vary on that. The only thing that loses a star is the reduction of the motion detection to the standard pie vs the enhanced. I didnt expect the better motion detection on the battery version but I since the wired version no longer has it I feel compelled to deduct a star.  Perhaps thats because this cam although it works well covers the area adjacent to my GEN 1 cam that has the better motion detection and thus a constant reminder.  Besides would it be horrible to have better motion detection on the battery version?",4
65332,"Bought this in hopes of using it out on RZR rides. Unfortunately, the image is not as stable as I would've hoped while riding. Other than that, the video quality is good and it takes decent pictures. I like the the wristband photo/video buttons. Definitely a great convenience feature.",4
157696,"Perfecto, funciona al 100% y bastante entretenido.",5
35669,No scratches can crack easily but protects phone.,5
65069,"All the affordable webcams are sold out because almost everyone is stuck at home and has to work or attend school online. Well this little action camera hooked right up to my PC and was good to go. The microphone doesn't work with the live camera (recording only) but we have headphones with a mic. Comes with a ton of mount options and we can now make our own ""action"" movies while we social distance. I only wish it came with a micro SD card.",4
184891,"Installation was fast and I haven't had any issues with it's operation but there is room for improvement.The most glaring issue is the beeping. You can't turn it off via a setting. If you want to stop the beeping your would have to physically hack the device to remove the speaker. This is apparently a safety feature. But the device already requires you to have door sensors, so I don't know why this is necessary. It really limits this to emergency closing only. I wouldn't be able to use this after everyone in the house has gone to bed.",4
13947,"I kept breaking the original chargers that came with my iPhone & so after replacing them with knockoff version of the same kind, I decided to instead try the nylon usb cables.So far so good! I am happy with my purchase.",5
5405,AMD always cost less in CPUs compared to intel even though intel can usually run faster they cost equally more and more as they get up there. this is perfect for gaming and has no issues. modulates itself on voltages from 3.7ghz to 4.3 based with the x470 motherboard meeting the demands that are required without waste.,5
123146,Great strong paper.,5
107334,"I don't see a mute button on the headphone. I don't want to use mute on the phone itself. Sometimes I leave a phone charging and I walk in other parts of the house during a call, but I would not be able to mute/unmute it during my calls. Noise cancelling exists, but I don't think is close to the Bose headphones.....I know the price is different.I also realised that you can't use noise cancellation when using wired connection, like when you connect to plane's entertainment systems.",4
193694,"The camera turns itself on to record on its own. I've had it turned ""off"" but then a day later I start to get motion alerts and see it's turned on and recording. Also sometimes turned itself on when reset with a power outage. I know it's supposed to be a ""setting"" if it's recording or not, but it seems to always be recording",3
1353,I love the backlit keyboard. Good speed for web surfing and basic work. Doesn't hold charge as long as some others.,4
90444,Not much else to say. Does what it’s intended to do very well. I’ve had zero issues with it after a good few months.,5
11624,Very inconsistent,3
64118,"Awesome and really I love the AKASO camera. I bought the ""AKASO EK7000 ULTRA HD 4K"" camera, after a friend of mine recommended me. It excellent 4k video quality and easy setup.  The battery life is 60-80 minutes, pair batteries really full the purpose of my road biking on country roads and trails.  It records audio too.  Awesome camera for reasonable price and its compared GoPro, which is very expensive.  Few weeks back, I went to mountain trails and it capture nice video quality with no vibrations, nice image stabilization.  . Definitely I recommend my colleagues and friends.",5
153347,Stopped working after a couple months,2
147679,"Esta excelente hemos tenido horas de diversión con el, lo estamos disfrutando cada día, la mejor parte es que puede ser portable y consola",5
32017,This was very easy to install on my tv and right away found lots of the local channels I was searching for plus more. It is also very easy to move to another tv if needed.,5
103571,"Each time I went to use this in my car, I'd get ""Lost connection to the network"" or similar error.  I'd unplug and restart, try again, re-associate the app with the device, etc. Finally it would work, but I had high hopes and it was hardly worth the hassle. However, the reason I finally unplugged it was the amount of data used.  I went through 75% of my 5gb data plan just by using it for 2 weeks. I've never had that problem before (nor since).",1
113698,Great product,5
19103,"This would be 5 stars and awesome in every way simply because it can travel with us, but what is going on with the audio sync. I have gone online and tried everything recommended and pretty much every show the sound is out of sync with the lips moving on the screen. Super irritating and makes it hard to watch. I am constantly having to do a reboot. Just tried turning of all Alexa controls and tv controls and that seems to have worked for past 48 hours but kind of defeats the whole Alexa everything connected features which is a bummer. So I wanted it for an easy access to Disney plus and I have that with it for 150.00 less than new Apple TV. I have old one and no Disney plus app. So I give it 3 stars for now. If they come out with a fix I would give it more because a lot of other people have been having the same issue.",3
68701,Ok not only is this thing pretty loud for it's crazy small size but the battery life is so impressive it almost makes me mad at it. I took it out into the woods and somehow this little speaker went on and on for almost 3 days. Think I've had it a little over a year now and it continues to impress. Absolute best value ever. And did I mention how fun it is to say? Go ahead. Do it. Use your best German accent and say it a couple times. If that doesn't put a smile on your face you must suck at parties. 10/10 this little guy is the best speaker I've ever ordered.,5
2945,"I recommended this to my girlfriend as a budge PC for her to use Photoshop and play the Sims 4. Though it met the minimum requirements of this software the sluggish speed was immediately noticeable with no programs running. As a power user typically operating from an i7 I consider this unbearable for any user. Nothing wrong with the computer, just be aware you're buying decade old technology. I'll be returning this and spending closer to $600.",3
101926,"Once we got this all set up, it worked OK. The issues I ran into were that I have too many connected devices and either my car or this device would not cooperate. My phone, watch, and the echo auto would all show the music playing any time I used the echo and if any of those devices sound was turned down, I wouldn't be able to hear anything through my car. Using the echo to play music also made skipping songs frustrating because I now had to use the wake word and wait for alexa to respond each time instead of just pushing a button on my steering wheel. Overall this made my listening experience in my car more inconvenient.",3
73724,Sounds great. Full range of sound. Can easily up the bass depending on what you place next to it. Super fun for shower. Love that the volume control buttons are so easy to find and feel.  Husband got it for me for Christmas but it would make a great gift for a Teen.,5
191998,"Between my friend and I, we now have 15 of these little guys. For the price, they cannot be beat. They are great for motion notifications also.They are not smooth in playing back recorded video from the camera but are smooth and easy when playing back the SD card from your computer, Ipad or iphone.",5
100864,"So easy to configure.I have an old truck without bluetooth. However, I used the Echo Auto's output port to a bluetooth fm transmitter to get the audio to work through my speakers.",4
72132,"I bought this bluetooth speaker for my brother-in-law as a birthday gift. It is compact, sleek and easy to use. I like the fact that it's waterproof (perfect for outdoor use in the event of a surprise rain shower) and has a sturdy feel to it. My only issue is the limited degree of range for the speaker. If the speaker side is not angled directly your way then you might not have as good of sound. But for the price point this speaker does a solid job.",4
135513,"These are fantastic. I use them for everything, they connect to my TV via firestick, they connect to my echo show, and they of course connect to my phone. These are easily the best wireless headphones I've ever had. The battery life is great and I often forget to charge my case. Another great feature of these is the fact if your case is running low on charge and you have a Samsung note 10, you can charge the case via your phone.All in all I'm in love with these headphones.",5
17634,Works well. Durable.,5
87950,"Only for music, so if you're looking for something that you could utilize hands-free on your phone this would not be for you but if you're looking for music it works as described",4
167798,"Purchased for a PS4 to play Modern Warfare, this keyboard and mouse combo is fantastic for the price.The keyboards button have a soft to the touch feel and require shorter press distance than your standard keyboard. The keyboard is very quiet and has multiple lighting modes with brightness adjustment and you can adjust the speed at which some lighting settings pulse.",5
106498,"These were good headphones all around. I bought them about 6 months ago and have enjoyed using them just about every day for work in the office. I especially liked the purple color of the ones I bought.However, just yesterday the swivel hinge on one of the ear cups broke, causing the ear cup to spin freely instead of stopping at 90 degrees. The plastic mechanism that makes the ear cups swivel to 90 degrees is a bit flimsy and will likely break before you've had these for a year. I expect I will still be able to use the headphones if I duct-tape that ear cup in place so it doesn't swivel at all, but that's not ideal.",3
121724,Open box,1
179010,Easy to install and hook up to Google home. Works well and I’ve had no issues. Have had them installed for about a month.,5
110568,"I have a large yard and spend a lot of time on the lawn tractor mowing and these head phones are just perfect for this sometimes twice a week task!  I also use them indoors to listen to music and with 3 pups running around they do their job just awesome!  Can't hear the pups, just the music!  Kudos to you and your head phones!!",5
121878,It's paper!,4
976,Will play older games (think 90’s integrates graphics).Bought this for college to help with projects and group work. Fast start up and good battery life. Reliable and sleek looking too.,5

5031,"AMD has been a standard for me in building PC's for over 20 years.  Some say they are slower than INTEL but I haven't stood by with a stop watch yet to time them.  However, since the AMD Athlon in 1999 I've been sold on the ability to overclock and use to play gaming, or just use as a matter of a regular computer.  I've never had a bad AMD CPU yet.  I've had motherboards go out and other components fail but I have always had good service with AMD CPU's.",5

177809,"Over the past year or two, I've been slowly converting my 'dumb' home into a 'smart' one, and these switches are one of the changes I've been adding.  (Specifically, I'm using one of these in my hallway, one in my guest bedroom, one in my guest bathroom, a 3-way version in my kitchen, and a 3-way version in my entryway.)First off: once set up and running, these work and work well.  The ones in my guest bedroom, hallway, and kitchen have been installed for about six months now and work perfectly.  (I can't speak to longevity on the ones in the guest bathroom and entryway yet as I just installed those this past weekend.)",4
13629,"This product worked well for about 14 months. Now it functions intermittently and has become practically useless. I believe there were various warranties pointing to it lasting many years. However, after a number of months amazon stops honoring these warranties. This is an oversight in amazons service and credibility. Amazon ought to honor the multi-year warrant they alluded to.",1
9018,Works exactly as it should! So nice to simply lay the phone on it instead of wearing out the plug (which we have done). I will be buying more for location convenience.,5
165290,Amazing,5
155693,Amazing game,5
5270,"Had to get a replacement (it happens sometimes) but it runs just fine. The only ""issue"" I found was the heat it makes. I highly recommend getting a top of the line cooler and thermal compound before using it for any form of work. (I have no issues with gaming with a low end cooler but I'll need to upgrade it)",4
130872,"I’ve had these for a few days now and the initial impression is: Great! I did a lot of research before selecting this product and I can say so far, it has paid off and you won’t be disappointed with this product.Pros:",5
187194,This has been a great way to receive packages!  I know exactly when they’re arrived and do not have to worry about weather or package pirates. I can’t wait to use this during the holidays!,5
149055,The headset fits very comfortably on my head and I can have them on for hours and not feel uncomfortable like some other headset I have owned previously. The sound is really good and surprisingly you can really hear the base with this headset which you usually don't get as good quality of the base in other headsets. It is nice to have the option of lights on the headset with the USB although it can sometimes get in the way if the device doesn't have a USB but I can deal with that. Overall it is a really great headset.,5
158127,Este juego esta genial!!,5
139327,I am updating my review for this product. It has come to my attention that the ear buds may have been defective .This doesn't represent the quality of the products as a whole.,5
166561,"Awesome charging station. I am glad it charges at the back of the controller, the front port gets weak and shoddy after a time and eventually fails completely.",5
97053,It is pretty quick and sounds AMAZING. Love the manual camrea shutter on it and love that  it has the web browsers. For the price it is so worth getting. The price and size is perfect for a kitchen and maybe a bedroom. Also the sound is crisp and the subwoofer in it makes it even better. Great buy!,5
125975,I thought this was a great deal especially as a college student,5
98142,The Echo Show will not link with Spectrum TV.  I returned the product within hours.,1
131795,"These earbuds are so much better sounding than my previous pair. My music sounds great and I'm glad I bought these and saved some money. I also really like the case, its so small and compact, it slides right into my pocket and I barely notice its there. The indicator lights on the case showing remaining battery is also very useful.",5
153395,"Cheaply made, does not look like the item pictured, and no returns allowed!!",1
5246,Eats everything I throw at it. I edit 4k videos in Premiere with no issues.,5
144629,Really enjoy this product.,5
105340,I dislike and like the fact that the motion picks up every single movement.,5
136112,"I had the original. This is much better. The sound quality is spot on. The features are almost all there. I only wish you could connect to two phones at the same time. Its a pain in the butt to have to switch between my work phone and personal phone. However, this is my only complaint. I am very happy with these buds.",5
144150,Grandson loves it. Takes it to school (well he did) to play on bus and friends house to play on TV screen.,5
125799,shipping was fast great product would buy again,5
116956,"Best noise cancellation I’ve ever had on in ear headphones. Sound quality is pretty good, not the best I’ve had (Bose Sound Sports are better in this arena), but the comfort of these is bar none the best. Pairing was seamless and easy, although sometimes it cuts out during phone calls while I also have my Apple Watch connected.",5
168743,"WOrks as expected and I really like it. Didn't rate on durability because I've only had it a few weeks. But the materials are nice and it works properly.I have one issue with it. WHen I shut down and restart my computer, I have to reset the colors on the keyboard, everytime. That's a bit annoying.",4
153920,Awesome game!,5
75544,Sounds good and works great!,5
146152,Please stop,1
33384,Bought these-got 3 and just as good as the ones you buy in cell store for $40 a piece.  Had mine on for couple months-no scratches. No glares and it’s not popping up anywhere off the screen,5
46396,I use this to connect my macbook to projector systems and my TV. It's worked great.,5

22395,"I was just about to return the firestick 4K.  I had been trying to open the remote since yesterday when I received it.  I have read numerous complaints about the difficulty in opening the remote.  So why oh why has Amazon not made this easier for clients.  HAS IT OCCURRED TO AMAZON TO PACK THE REMOTE ALREADY OPEN?  Should I mention that the pressure I  have had to apply to get the thing open has caused me shoulder pain and pain between my fingernail and the flesh on the tips of my thumbs? I am writing this with tears in my eyes, between pain and frustration.",1
102827,"I was so excited when I got this! Well, excitement quickly turned to frustration when I tried to install and get it up and running. It never connected, all the cords looked ridiculous and messy. I said I was returning it, but mom life got the best of me and I missed out on my return window. So now I might as well have flushed $25. Pathetic attempt Amazon.",1
15933,These are the worst chargers I’ve ever purchased.  I literally have to wiggle the insert to get a charge that only lasts for a few seconds.  Do NOT purchase!  They claim to be compatible but they are not.,1
182471,good,5
195668,"We’ve been using this as a baby monitor, so my review is directed towards that use.Overall we have been very impressed with this. It is much more affordable than purchasing a separate monitor. Audio and picture quality are fantastic.",4
51309,Love it,5
150497,Great product and really comfortable. The headphones broke after 1 month but I emailed the company and they responded so quickly. They tried to trouble shoot it but that did not fix it. They promised to send me a replacement. This just occurred a week ago. I will update when I receive replacement.,5
136116,I love these Buds..sure beats the old wire ones.,5
127370,economically price,5
142561,I actually hated to give these a bad review bc they worked great for about 3 months. Then one day it just stopped charging out of no where. I've seen other reviews with the same issue....I can't return them bc i'm past my return date. What a total bummer....Only other thing I will say about these is if you have small ear holes they wont stay in...Luckily I was able to switch the ear piece out with another set I had.,2
20463,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I knew that the Fire Stick got some channels and services that my Roku didn't.  I was hesitant because I LOVE my Roku, but I decided that I could just have both devices set up.  I set them both up and began using it... and haven't so much as turned on the Roku since.  The voice control with the ability to say things like, ""Alexa, search YouTube for Pink Floyd"" is awesome.  But I got all of my services and channels that I wanted (except for the Roku channel, obviously) and it's wonderful. I should mention that I run the Roku Reviews page on Facebook, so this isn't someone who just doesn't know how to use the Roku correctly.  :)",5
21786,4k version connects very well with wifi and functionality improved over HD version - leverages many 4k videos that are included with Amazon prime. Remote integration also very useful. I switched both my Roku Express devices for this and discovered Amazon have a trade in credit for those which made the deal even better. i have Alexa but haven't synched as the voice command on the firestick does all i need.,5
37789,Looks good and installed easy. Sometimes not as reactive to touch.,5
141174,"These work very well and the battery will last about 3 hours on a charge.  They are a little large, but I find them comfortable enough. I’m not sure they would stay in place during activities although for my use they are fine.  The holder is also a charger and it seems like I can get 1 or maybe 2 charges before it needs to be plugged in again. They turn on when you remove them from the box and connect automatically to each other and your device. They can be used on multiple devices once you have them paired. Overall a decent product at a decent price.",5
94097,"ordered the show to use in kitchen, and set it up to always show time and temp, with rotating topics. I never use recipe books any more, use recipes on Pinterest on my iPad. The show will bring up recipes, but rarely one for what I want. If you DO find a recipe you like, you can save it. However, when you need it again, you will have to call up all recipes and go thru them. I looked up a favorite on Pinterest, found the website it was on, and asked Alexa for it, but she couldn’t access it.  Disappointing!",4
95663,"The ""Show 8"" was a disappointment. It's a novelty item at best. Lots of other tech I wish I had spent my money on but, I have it, it's in the living room and I still struggle to find a use for it, other than to give me the weather... The loss of privacy is really not worth it really!I would not buy again and most likely wouldn't give it as a gift, unless I had the box for this one. Sorry, I did have high hopes for this!",3

188015,"I should have listened to the other reviews. I have had the connect for about two weeks, it works 10% of the time. Most of the time it is off line even though it is about 5 feet from my router. I had hoped that August would read all the reviews and do something to fix it but they have not. It ""downloaded"" the latest firmware which did nothing btw. There is no phone number to call August they only deal with you via email. I now cannot connect to it at all and have a ""trouble ticket"" in with August but I am not very optimistic. I will likely be returning the product. How can this company ship this product? It is a lot of money for something that is clearly not even a beta release.",1
22704,"It takes a  little time to work all the kinks out and learn the difference between what is free and what has to be purchased.  Once you get a good idea of how things work, you're pretty much good to go.  Setting the Fire TV Stick up was really no major problem at all.  For us, all that was required was internet connections and comparable televisions; otherwise, there were no complications.  You will need to purchase a Fire TV Stick for each TV that you'll be using, but when compared to the cost of a monthly cable television bill, purchasing additional Fire TV Sticks is a major savings.  Regardless of what you watch on television, there is access to all programs.  Oh, and if you should miss a few special shows, there are ways to catch up on those too.  We're completely satisfied with our Fire TV Sticks and we're true seniors.  This is to say that even seniors will enjoy them.",5
32493,Anybody wanting to quit cable should buy this antenna. Within a few minutes I added 40 channels to my TV. This will save me thousands of dollars a year. I highly recommend this.,5
139098,"Taking my 5 star down to 3 star due to them saying it’s waterproof but it’s NOT. Went into the pool for less than 10 seconds and dies. Don’t claim their waterproof when my died from getting water on them. Love these works perfectly when doing sports, they stay in the ear very well. The battery life has lasted me over 6 hours of consistent use! The only weird thing I find about it is the way they charge. You connect them into the case but the case dies very fast without being plugged into an outlet. So the earbuds have good battery life but the case does not. The connection to both of them at first is difficult to figure out but after a few uses it gets fairly easy. Overall very impressed with the sound quality and battery life.",3
85380,"Shut off mid use, checked with Bose and online but didn't see a fix. The power cord seems fine, possibly a fuse or some other internal component.  $99 to fix through Bose.
