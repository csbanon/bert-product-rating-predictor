If you work in the cosmetics world. This ring light is a must have to take pictures of your clients. The lighting is beyond amazing.,5,1,2019-4-26,1,2,1
"There are literally no downfalls to this product. I was a little iffy purchasing this due to the price, but I am so thankful I did. My selfies and videos look so much better now!! It comes with two different covers to put over the ring light (warm and white) which I definitely appreciate so I can switch up my pics. I like to use the white mostly though, definitely for my makeup tutorials. It also comes with a carrying/storage bag for when you travel. If you‚Äôre a photographer, beauty blogger or just someone that loves taking bomb selfies, you should for sure get this!!",5,1,2019-3-13,1,2,1
My photos or videos look better!,5,1,2019-4-1,1,2,0
I love this ring light! It makes my videos look much better and provides that professional bright look I need. It was very easy to assemble and very easy to break down and place back into its travel bag. Definitely a great buy!!!,5,1,2019-3-24,1,2,1
IN LOVE!! You can adjust lighting how much brightness you want to appear on your face and contrasting! I‚Äôm using this to do makeup video and modeling. I‚Äôm totally in love with this!,5,1,2019-3-11,1,2,1
"I ordered it to document my makeups... I am amazed on how powerful the light is! And how easy to assemble as well !Attached are pictures with the differenct coloured covers... the room's lights were completely off... I just had the ring light on. I took pictures with the lowest, medium, & highest intensity.",5,1,2018-12-28,1,2,1
"Super easy to set up. The ring light sits a bit heavy for the tripod but just angle it right and I should be good to go. It includes two filter options which are plastic covers for either white or warmer (orange) light. Wireless remote is a cute option but not the best function as it didn't always work. The tripod can accommodate screw in style accessories like phone or iPad mini holsters. The ring light must be plugged in which can get tricky if you're not close to a power outlet so be prepared to have an extension.  The light is super bright and has several settings but usually people don't want it too bright for when I use it at parties especially if the lights in the room are out, the light is more than enough at the first or second setting. I really enjoy this light and it's a perfect beginners kit that makes it look like you're a pro.",5,1,2019-1-23,1,2,1
"I purchased this product for my TikTok videos, etc. It works great! I love it! You can change the lighting from really dim to very bright! So whatever you prefer they have! It was pretty easy to assemble, and it‚Äôs a good size. I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase, I recommend!",5,1,2019-1-12,1,2,1
"I mean just look at the pictures. My skin looked flawless and bright. I was GLOWING. Like if i could have this light on my all the time, I seriously would.",5,0,2019-1-21,1,2,1
Update: originally gave this a two star review due to a faulty cord and missing screw which meant it wouldn‚Äôt stand up however: the customer service team reached out to me to replace the faulty parts. I had just gotten rid of the light since it wasn‚Äôt working and sat around for 6 months. They replaced the entire thing.The replacement works famously. And the fact that they reached out to fix the issue meant a lot to me.,5,1,2019-3-9,1,2,0
"assembly was a bit confusing, but doable. ring light itself works well but sometimes flickers on and off and has to be re-plugged-in. major issue: tripod camera mount screw.while screwing the attachment into my camera as usual, the screw broke in half. part of it is still in my camera, which i am having to get professionally removed as to not damage the camera on my own.",1,1,2018-12-30,1,2,1
"Extremely disappointed with this product. I was so excited about this purchase. I assembled everything with no issue and the light worked just fine the first day. I took it down,  put it in the carrying case, and i havent touched it for 4 days. Today I set everything up to make a video and the light no longer works. Everything is plugged up and hooked up as it should be and the light wont turn on. Im soooooooo disappointed by this... Im going to email the manufacturer to see if something can be done. I dont reccomend this product to anyone at the moment.",1,1,2018-12-15,1,2,1
"The actual light is powerful, but the stand is TERRIBLY WOBBLY. See the video. It leans to one side,  which means all of my videos look like the camera is leaning to one side.  In order for my camera to be straight and balance, I have to put a folded up cardboard paper or something under one of the legs of the  tripod in order to get it to go straight up and down.  Also, the cord that connects from the power converter to the lighting fixture is defective. So by merely touching the cord the entire thing turns off.",2,1,2018-12-17,1,1,0
"It has totally increased my quality (I'm using the ring light in the picture shown) which is helping my views and subscribers etc. I love the filters and the bluetooth clicker is amazing, on the instructions it says that it's only compatible for the iPhone 5 and below but that's not true, you can pair it to any device with bluetooth capability.",5,1,2019-1-21,1,1,1
Guys I need help! I seen so many amazing reviews so I decided to purchase this light... it came in i set it all up and it will not turn on.... I already threw away all the packaging it came in so idk what to do.. does anyone know any # I can call to get it replaced. I really wanted to love it I was so excited.. help üòìüòìEDIT: I called customer service and I left about 3 voicemails and I got a call back! ü•≥ I sent them the non-working ring light and I got sent a new one that so far is working great! I‚Äôm very happy with the way my problem was handeled and I would 100% recommended this ring light!,4,1,2019-1-16,1,1,0
UPDATE‚Äî  I had previously written a review based on the fact that part of the mounting was defective- A brand rep reached out to me - sent me a new one immediately and walked me thru the set up ( turns out that unfortunately I did have a defective unit the first time around that I was completely unaware of)  after getting the new one and getting it set Up which literally took less then 5 minutes from start to finish - the ring lite is now perfect! Do NOT expect the seller to help-  if you have any issues at all contact the brand- seller is worthless! Light is perfect now - no issues at all! I want to add that the silver knob piece that is attached to the stand  (has a screw sticking out of the top of it) all you is place the ring lite on top of it and tighten the screw knob  that is attached to the ring light it looks like a wacky configuration because it doesn‚Äôt make sense logically why it would attach like that but it actually does work and that is exactly what you‚Äôre supposed to do once you unfold the arm that attaches to the ring light and you unscrew the knob so that you can see directly looking into it without the screw you simply placed that over that silver knob and then tighten the screw knob handle on the light itself. Hope this little tidbit is helpful  because really it is kind of a wacky configuration and it doesn‚Äôt seem like it would go together it seems like there would be a piece missing but nope that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to be the brand representative was so extremely helpful in getting me a new one and just reaching out to me literally after several several months I had used a defective one so like I said if you have any issues don‚Äôt waste your time contacting the seller just tried to reach out to the brand it‚Äôs self ! TY to mike for the excellent customer service!,5,1,2018-8-10,1,1,1
"I am so glad I‚Äôd purchased this item! I got the 18‚Äù and it‚Äôs perfect! The lighting is great and really make your photos pop. It came with everything in the description. The directions are included. Easy to put together and light weight.  However, the remote that comes with it isn‚Äôt compatible for iPhone users with a 6 or better.",5,1,2018-3-20,1,2,1
No manual. No Stand.,2,1,2016-12-28,1,1,1
"UPDATE:After I was told that I would not be able to have my ring light replaced, I about gave up on this light. Just a couple days ago, the actual manufacturer reached out to me, concerned about my review. They were more than happy to offer to replace my faulty light, and although it was months after my light stopped working, I really appreciate the fact that the company cares for their customers. What‚Äôs even better is that they did one day shipping for my replacement! I‚Äôm highly pleased and would like to personally thank Cherry from Neewer for such amazing service. I will update again when my light comes in!",4,1,2017-12-22,1,1,1
Works perfectly for recording gaming videos in your closet!,5,1,2017-8-31,1,9,1
"I bought this for YouTube videos and I love it. I currently use it at my vanity for makeup and skincare. It's a very bright (but adjustable) true white light. I love the fact that the light isn't a tube but many smaller LED lights making it less likely to break. The light & tripod break down very easily and fit into the transport bag quickly. The only thing I would ask for is for it to come with a better tripod. I am planning on buying a more sturdy tripod. The issue is that the light is heavier than (I think) is meant for THIS tripod, especially with a camera attached. Not a big deal, it's still a great product and worth the money.",5,1,2018-3-26,1,1,0
"i LOVE this ringlight. the package came with everything i needed to build it, and included a carrying case. it is brighter than i even need, and it‚Äôs so stable and dependable. this ringlight is perfect for doing your makeup or recording videos of makeup and taking pictures of your makeup. i included some pictures of what the lighting looks like on an iphone camera.",5,1,2017-10-22,1,8,1
"I was so excited to receive the this RING LIGHT.  I was planning on doing some awesome photo / video shoots right away with all the new equipment I just purchased.  After it was delivered.. i looked over the instructions, put all he parts together and plugged into the outlet.  Pressed the power button, but no light... nothing!  Frustrated... I contacted their one VIP customer support person through email and no response or support.  NOT HAPPY.  Looking to return for refund, but would rather it just be replaced to see how well it works.  CUSTOMER SUPPORT if you can read this.. please help out a not happy, frustrated customer.",1,1,2018-2-11,1,1,0
"New LuLaRoe consultant and was looking for decent lighting at a decent price. The dimmable feature is an excellent option. The Bluetooth remote to operate your camera is pretty great also. It took me less than 2 minutes to download the app, connect my Samsung galaxy s8plus and start shooting remotely. The soft tube pole extension (removable) is absolutely fantastic, you can tilt and angle the whole ring light and your camera all at once. I really like that the power cord isn't too small and has a decent length so you can move it a few feet away from the wall. The tripod has great extension and with a little tweaking and adjustment it isn't wonky and crooked like other reviews were mentioning. I included a photo to show the length of the cord. Also the tripod isn't even close to being fully extended in the photo. I really like this product.",5,1,2017-10-20,1,1,1
Works great and as expected. Easy to set up and move around. Assists in taking great photos.The only complaint I have about it is the phone holder it comes with. It has a flexible ball joint and wasn‚Äôt holding the phone as steady as I needed when tilted at an angle because of this. I ended up finding and ordering a different one through amazon that works more like I need it to. (The Neewer smart phone holder) it attaches to this stand perfectly so now I have zero complaints.,5,1,2018-2-16,1,5,0
The overall rating had to be 3 stars. This is because the unit would not power on. I had to remove the back panel to finish wiring the unit. Simple installation but this should have been completed to shipping to the consumer. I was going to send it back but I also thought I could fix it so I opted for the latter option. They red wires pushed in to locking terminations. The instructions were not helpful either. The product will now function as advertised hence the three star review. If your unit does not power on immediately remove the power source then the back panel to ensure all wires are correctly terminated. Push wires into slots until you hear a click. Too test the termination give the wire a little tug to make sure it does not pull out of the block.,3,1,2018-7-24,1,4,1
"I am hoping that it can be rectified with a product that works. I spent 10 minutes hooking it up without directions. After that, I turn the switch to on and nothing. I tried a few times and the led bulbs finally turned on. I checked all the connections and tried to turn it off and on again and no luck. There must be a problem with the switch. Of course, now I have to take it all back apart, package it up, and return it and hope the next one I get isn't defective. I sent an email to the seller in hopes that this can be expedited as I need this lighting system asap.Edited to add: I got another defective light. However this one took 1 month to stop working. Therefore it is passed the window to return it. I am out the money and still have to buy another light for my business. Unfortunate because it‚Äôs a nice light however the switch is faulty.",1,1,2018-1-17,1,7,0
"Is a good light to make  closeups videos, but didn‚Äôt work for me, I wear glasses and the light give me bright circle light on my glasses. I tryed diferent positions but i couldn‚Äôt find the way to have the iluminaci√≥n with out the reflection.",3,1,2018-8-14,1,3,0
"The instructions were not clear as to how to assemble the ring light. And it did not turn on immediately. After reading some of the reviews one person said to check the cables were properly connected. I disconnected and connected the cables and it did turn on after all. However, it should have turned on the first time around without going through that hassle. Other than than that the light itself is good.",3,1,2018-12-4,1,2,0
Awesome product for the price.. Gets the job done for lighting that I needed,4,1,2017-2-12,1,1,1
You must buy. I love this ring light!!! I'm a MUA and body artist and this is exactly what I needed. Perfect lighting to apply and take pictures or videos,5,1,2018-1-10,1,5,1
"This review is going to be a bit lengthy lol. First of all be prepared to receive absolutely NO instructions with this ring light whatsoever. You literally have to sit there and just play with it to figure out how to expand the tripod, how to snap the filters onto the ring light itself, how to mount the ring light onto the tripod once you've gotten the filters on, how to make sure everything is tightened down once fully assembled and finally, how to use the hot shoe camera and camera phone mounts that come with this set. (I haven't even begun to figure out how to use the Bluetooth remote that came with this set, and while I'm THRILLED this is included, it would be nice to have instructions on how to use it lol). This set includes TWO, I repeat TWO power cords, and one is for use in another country! This is great, but without instructions you'll be sitting there confused for a bit trying to figure out what to do with the darn thing. Very annoying!As far as the ring light itself, it's good. I'm a wig maker so I purchased the ring light to take better pictures of my mannequins wearing my wigs. I've attached 4 pics with this review, 2 pics taken with natural sunlight, and 2 taken with this ring light so you can decide for yourself which looks best. For me there wasn't a ton of difference. Natural sunlight looks just as beautiful as the ring light to be honest. The ring light did create more definition in the HAIR itself, but because of the ring light's brightness I lost definition in the mannequin. This kind of evened things out for me in terms of deciding which lighting, natural or ring light, is best for MY particular needs.",5,1,2017-9-10,1,8,1
"So far so good! I just purchased this today!I want to say, thank goodness it‚Äôs dimmable because it‚Äôs so bright, on high it‚Äôs blinding! Lol",5,1,2018-1-19,1,5,1
"This is my first time buying a ring light, I needed one for my Facebook live beauty videos and this is perfect. I'm a novice and I'm super happy with this product.",5,1,2017-6-4,1,5,1
I spent a LOT of time window shopping for the best ring light option on Amazon. THIS ONE IS IT.Pros:,5,1,2017-3-12,1,7,0
Everything I can ask for in a ring light. This thing's can get extremely bright or dim. Just awesome!,5,1,2019-3-20,1,1,1
"This is a great little lighting kit for under $100, but it's actually a no-go for me because I wear glasses, but that's not the fault of the kit but rather an inherent problem with run lights (they are notorious for glare).If you are looking to film or photograph yourself and no other subjects, with a cell phone or DSLR, at a short distance, this one kit is all you need. In other words, this is great for vlogging, selfies, or portrait work. It's not so great for interviewers where two people are on-screen.",4,1,2018-8-14,1,4,0
"I love my ringlight ! No piece was missing , easy to assemble less than 7 minutes ! Everything works !",5,1,2019-4-5,1,2,1
"This is the second time I am trying to purchase Ringlight from NEEWER and the second time it arrives without the tripod/stand kit.I wonder if anyone bothers to reach out to me and do good by me, unbelievable. If I could leave 0 stars, I would.",1,1,2017-8-20,1,4,0
I‚Äôve had this for awhile but now that I‚Äôve opened it and put most of it together.  They sent me a different plug I can‚Äôt plug it in now I gotta order a converter just to use my light üòï,3,1,2017-11-30,1,1,1
"So far I am very happy with this product. I am a photographer and shoot with a full frame canon DSLR. I have always been intrigued by ring lights, but always felt I would never really use. I saw this product and figured the price was worthwhile as an intro. So far I am very happy. I only tested it out with my front facing camera on my iPhone, but I liked the results.The camera mount seems a bit too flimsy for me to trust putting my camera on it, but I have own tripod, so that is an easy workaround. I posted the pictures I took with my phone‚Äôs selfie camera. I‚Äôll do an update when I use an actual camera to give a final review.",4,1,2017-12-8,1,3,1
"Barely holds the phone, extremely hard to get into the phone attachment.  Pictures look washed out and unprofessional - looks much better in regular light. The entire set up is cheap and not worth $10.  I was really looking forward to it b/c of good reviews - but I'm convinced they are fake.  I tried to make it work with different cameras (all very high end that take great video/pics otherwise) as well as in different rooms and situations.  Washed out all of the colors. Gave it some time to really try to make work, now it's too late to return.  Very upset with this waste of $100.  Probably best to get something like this from an actual store.",1,1,2018-8-19,1,1,0
"I took some time to research which one I needed and wanted and am very pleased by my choice. This has been great. I needed something mobile and light, but effective. I've already shot a lot of quick video with this where I don't have to setup the whole studio to get great lighting and shots right.It's pretty straightforward. Easy to clip on the filters, I use white, not sure why you'd want to use orange but either way it's easy. The cord is long which is great, the holder for my iPhone works great. I've actually shot stuff in all conditions (night, daylight, garage, bathroom, etc...) it works great! The case is nice for travel and storage. Super simple breakdown and your off and going.",5,1,2017-9-5,1,2,0
"***UPDATE*** AFTER I LEFT THIS REVIEW THE COMPANY REACHED OUT TO ME VIA EMAIL. I HAVE SINCE RETURNED THE FAULTY LIGHT AND RECEIVED A REPLACEMENT.I purchased this ring light in October 2018 once I receive it I didn‚Äôt have any issues assembling it as many of the reviewers have stated it was very easy to assemble. I used it once the day after receiving it for an hour. It worked perfectly fine the light setting were great and just what I needed. After the first use I unplugged it and left it on the tripod for about a month without using it again. I went to use it three days ago and I plugged it in and the lights were flickering really bad so I turned it off and left it plugged in thinking maybe it needs to charge. I went back two hours later and the light never came on. Not even the flicker that it was doing before. I contacted the company multiple times via email and i haven‚Äôt received a response in three days so I called the number that the neewer company provides under every negative, yet truthful review and no one answered the phone and guess what, the voicemail is full.  This company has a faulty, cheap, poorly made malfunctioned product and they know it‚Äô but they choose to do nothing about it! I purchased the 4year warranty with an outside company and I tried to file a claim with them but they advise that my product is still covered under neewers manufacture warranty so it‚Äôs nothing that they can do until that one expires in a year! What‚Äôs the use of a manufacturers warranty if you can‚Äôt even get in contact with the company! Bad business and even worse customer service. I don‚Äôt have money to give away and I should have taken all the negative reviews into consideration and not purchased the product. Obviously this is an issue and the company doesn‚Äôt care as they‚Äôre still selling this faulty product!",1,1,2018-12-4,1,1,0
I wanted something smaller the 18‚Äôis HUGE I wish I would of known but overall it‚Äôs works great I love it. I‚Äôve always wanted a ring light I really like the bag it comes with so I can take it with me anywhere I go to do peoples makeup,4,1,2019-3-17,1,1,1
"This Neewer Ring Light is my ideal choice, and it is easy to carry (bag included). It provides smooth, uniform illumination itself because objects receive light from all directions. I often use a mobile phone to shoot simple videos, and now even if I use snapchat, I will turn on this light.",5,1,2019-4-27,1,1,0
I love this ring light! I've been wanting it for the longest. The tripod Is very sturdy and the ring is big enough to hold my Sony a5100 camera. Its perfect for YouTube videos and gives the perfect lighting.,5,1,2019-4-24,1,1,1

"I needed a new ring light for my on location makeup services. I was looking mainly for a light that was travel friendly, easy to assemble and take down, and had great light. It seemed this light would be perfect for me, the tripod was easy to figure out but once I attached the light, it seemed flimsy.

"This is a great light. I bought it for my daughter and I to use for photos and videos for work. I really like the picture quality we get with it and it seems so handy. We have probably used it 5-8 times over the past year that we have had it. The problem is it's unstable now and not very strong plastic, and the first time we took it apart to go mobile and shoot a video it fell apart, and now it does not stand up unless propped up. and it tips over eventually. I can't adjust it to have my camera inside it anymore. I hate to have to call this a loss since I barely got to use it and I really liked it and felt it was a good deal before it broke. I'm not even sure what part broke. I am wondering where I can call to see about buying just the tripod or stand (whatever it is called) replacement for it? If you are going to be moving this around or using it a lot I am not sure the quality is there since we barely used it but maybe it's a defective one hard to tell.",2,1,2018-6-17,1,3,0
"Hello I ordered a Neewer lamp just a week ago and when received it, it did not work when I plugged it in and was missing parts to it. It was missing some cords, the phone holder, the bluetooth clicker and more.  I was really looking forward to this lamp and have heard great reviews. If the seller could please contact me about this to ensure that this will not happen again when I reorder it would be greatly appreciated.Thank you",1,1,2018-10-15,1,7,0

This product is beyond disappointing :( The lighting is not professional looking. And the materials that the tripod is made out of are so cheap - the screws don‚Äôt hold and the thing that‚Äôs supposed to hold the phone in place keeps on falling off the ring light because there‚Äôs no back support. I bought to advertise my products for my skin care business but I can‚Äôt use it because it‚Äôs more of a hassle than it should be. For what this is it should only cost a maximum of $25.00 instead of the $110 that I paid for it.I‚Äôd love to return but it‚Äôs probably too late.,2,1,2019-4-2,1,4,0
Good choice for a ring light. I love the look that you get when using it. Really adds something that you don't get just from the phone's camera.,5,1,2019-4-28,1,7,0
"One of the best investments made for my content work. It's a great price for great quality. It's easy to assemble and take apart and I love that it's light enough to be able to take everywhere. I recently used the ringlight when shooting the first video for my YouTube channel for vegan recipes, VeganEats, and it really worked wonders and we were able to finish filming. It also works wonder for pictures. I have used it in a completely dark room and there is no extra light needed. 100% Recommended",5,1,2019-9-7,1,5,0

"First time buying a ring light and wasn‚Äôt sure what to get. Instructions are funky but I figured it out I think. Like that it came with a carrying case and phone holder although I can‚Äôt keep my phone in its otter box defender case while in the holder it‚Äôs too big. Not entirely sure how it will fit a tablet because it is kind of a tight fit for my iPhone X. The phone holder part will slip out from the slot but I‚Äôm not sure if I set that part up right (again directions not good). Came with a Bluetooth remote not entirely sure what that‚Äôs for. Came with two covers an orange one and a white ish clear one. I put the orange one on because that‚Äôs what the picture had on it. The orange gAve a warmer tone which is good since I have brown skin, but the white was awful and gave bad flashback. Without either it was way too bright and gave bad flashback and was hard to focus camera. Even with orange was still hard to completely focus camera in some angles it would go out of focus. Comes with three cords not even sure what or where one of them goes but the one that plugs into light and connects to the other plugs into wall and the light will turn on. The ring light part of it doesn‚Äôt even go that bright without the covers so with the covers it‚Äôs still not bright.Should‚Äôve came with better instructions on how to set up, more info on the parts given and what they do especially with the Cords.",1,1,2019-9-3,1,1,1
"I was very hopeful that I would like this product but it is overall of low quality. One of the parts that connect the soft tube to the main tripod is lose. And it‚Äôs so much so that the ring can‚Äôt stand still while im using it.No, it‚Äôs not a problem caused by my lack of knowledge in assembling. The assembly is fairly easy. But the connector doesn‚Äôt work well.",1,1,2018-12-1,1,7,0

Just got it in the mail and excitedly set it up to find out when I plugged it in and went to switch it on that it doesn't work at all. Not even a dim glow or light up.

"I live in the U.S. and was super excited to order this, I received it all in one piece and not broken (thankfully). Easy to assemble with the directions, I go to plug it in and look at prongs on the cord and realize that it must have been manufactured for Europe and not the U.S., I feel if this is the case then it needs to be made clear to the buyer that they'll also have to purchase an outlet converter. I've also emailed the company that makes this product and still haven't received an answer almost a day later.

"I bought this Oct. 9, 2017 and today is Jan. 3, 2018 and it stopped working. The LED lights have been flickering the past month while in use and today it won't turn on. Very disappointed because I am in the middle of photographing inventory. I can't find any troubleshooting or if the LED panels can be replaced or option of a new cord to buy. it's been less than 3 months using it so for the price this is unacceptable.",1,1,2018-1-3,1,1,0
"So I bought this light last July. I saw there were a couple of people with this issue of malfunction but I‚Äôd figure i would give it a couple months to see how I liked it. Well it‚Äôs been 5 months since I‚Äôve had and the light already don‚Äôt work properly! It flickers. Doesn‚Äôt turn on at times! I tried to contact Neewer and even though I received a clearly faulty item, they require us customers to pay for the shipping and packaging to get a replacement it. Due to the weight, that‚Äôs at least $30 out of my own pocket to get a one that works! To me that‚Äôs fraud ! I paid for something brand new which no longer works! To pay this much $ just for it to break in 5 months isn‚Äôt ridiculous. This is not a durable product and they don‚Äôt do much for their customers when their lights stop working. Stay away from it.",1,1,2019-1-9,1,7,0
"This is 18"" in diameter, which is pretty big.  It comes with tripod that extends far enough to put this at least 8 feet up for good down lighting.The carrying case that it comes with only fits the light and the accessories.  The tripod will not fit in the carrying case.  However, the cardboard box the whole thing comes in has a handle and is compact enough to use a carrying case for the whole system.  The box is pretty sturdy, so it should last for a long time if you aren't using this thing and hauling it around all the time.  If you do use it a lot, the box might not last a year.",4,1,2019-10-16,1,2,0
I prefer my Diva Ring over this.  The plastic covers are a pain to clip on perfectly and the orange covers just make me look orange.  I even used just two of them in hopes of getting a softer glow but the lighting overall still seemed a bit harsh.  The Diva Ring comes with a fabric cover which I feel softens the light up more.  I am not a professional so it could also be me not having the skill set to better understand how to manipulate the lighting...but for a beginner I have had no issues with the Diva Ring.,3,1,2018-3-19,1,8,0
"I received my ring light on time. I was excited to open my package but found out that there are missing pieces:- 61""/155cm light stand",1,1,2017-5-5,1,5,0
This light was purchased for my daughter who loves to apply makeup.  She uses this along with her Hollywood vanity mirror.  This is a professional grade light that most makeup artists use when applying makeup and it is great for photographers as well.  It was easy to assemble and it also includes a bag that is easily transferrable and light weight when taking it to a friend's or relative's place.  The light is so bright and adjustable to your liking.  My daughter also uses it as her bedroom lighting.  This was one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon.  I highly recommend this light and the diameter size is perfect!,5,1,2018-1-6,1,3,0
"I‚Äôve been wanting this ring light for so long after seeing it being used all over YouTube and even in person! I do makeup so for me this was a must and I was beyond excited when I got it for Christmas! I set it all up that night turned it on and was in awe of how awesome it looked using my phone and video. The adjustable dimming feature was a great feature to see just how bright you could light up a dark room or if there‚Äôs not a lot of natural light around this would sure do the trick! The next day I decided to test it out to do makeup on a client and 30minutes into doing their makeup..... it made a pop noise.. and SHUT OFF! I tried messing with the cords, trying a different outlet, waiting for the adapter to cool down, NOTHING! It did not turn back on! I only had it for ONE day! And on top of that in the middle of doing a clients makeup. I really really wanted to like this light! I‚Äôve been wanting it for so long! I contacted Amazon about it and there was nothing to be done then to just return it. I don‚Äôt know if I just got a bad seed of the bunch but I packaged it back up after ONE day and sent it back! *tears*",1,1,2018-12-28,1,1,0
"This is a great light but I wish I had researched a bit more.  This package is missing some key pieces, like the accessory that holds your camera and a bendable insert on the stand.  I see now that you can buy just the light for$75 and the stand with these accessories for only $20 so that would have saved me $50. If you are going to buy this brand I suggest researching what comes with the stand to make sure you are getting the best price.",3,1,2018-2-1,1,2,0
"Quite shocked actually at the design and quality of this item considering it's origin.  There are a number of small design details which were great to have.  An example would be that the power cord for the light ring has about a 10"" length of cord, then a detach point so when you move it you aren't dragging around a long cord.  In addition to that, the connector on it has a twist-to-lock type mechanism so it does not accidentally separate.The color filters for the ring are designed and made with good precision, so that they snap on really securely.",4,1,2018-9-11,1,1,0

"OMG! Lighting has been a real problem for me. I'm a vlogger, filmmaker and writer, so for my web site, I release videos of my creative process. A lot of times, the atmosphere should be intimate, not super bright. Other times, when I'm highlighting words on a page, I may want more brightness. So I needed a range of options, and I didn't want to buy a super expensive light fixture after spending so much already on a camera, lenses, etc. Someone told me about this light. Whoa! I had tried the small Neewer 216 light, and it's not enough-- it's more of a fill light. And sometimes I work late or early in the a.m., so I can't always catch natural light, which can be hit or miss. This light is incredible!NOTE: I also bought the diffuser cover separately (though it should be included anyway), and that may have made a difference in softness/look of the light. The test shots were lovely. Not too strong and bright; I wasn't awash in light. It was the perfect amount, which is what I've been lacking. I'm very excited about the possibilities with this!",5,1,2018-7-19,1,1,0

"I bought this light to use for lashing and microblading . It takes great pictures however when bent it‚Äôs very top heavy and you have to be careful not to let it tip over. The stand is kind of flimsy but if you don‚Äôt move it around much it will do. The light started malfunctioning after a little less than two months. Some days it works , some days it doesn‚Äôt , sometimes it randomly starts flickering or cuts all the way off. I contacted the manufacture but they wanted a video to show the issue when it happens, which is ridiculous because it‚Äôs random. The light was definitely not worth the money due to breaking so quickly",2,1,2019-1-2,1,3,0
"Got it in August. Broken in November. Also, the part that holds your camera falls off - like in the middle of a live and my phone didn't recognize the horizontal rotation making my video on the side.

"I have a bookstore that does weekly readings with authors. This ring light is a godsend for getting people through the meet and greet line. Before, it was a constant battle to get people to use their flash, which no matter how many times I told them, they would not turn it on. Their pictures never turned out and they would want to try again until they got a decent one. No more of that! Now it's one and done and the line keeps moving!",5,1,2019-4-27,1,1,0

"I expected more from this since it had such great reviews. It's not awful by any means but it's VERY flimsy. I can tell it was built very cheaply (what do you expect from Neewer?). I think this is one of the cheapest ring lights of this size on Amazon, so you get what you pay for. The hot shoe adapter for DSLR cameras is SO cheap and crappy, so I suggest buying a different higher quality one to use. It can't even hold up an average sized DSLR camera, and consistently falls over.  The ringlight also doesn't fit comfortably inside the case/holder it comes with, even with constant rearranging.This is a great ringlight for beginners whether it be filming or taking. I will still use this until whenever it breaks. But if you want something more durable and easier to use, I suggest investing in a nicer one.",3,1,2019-2-22,1,3,0
"I bought this product in December and it worked really great used it a couple of times for video shoots and some still photography but after the six time using it it wouldn‚Äôt turn on..

I know it‚Äôs still under warranty but it‚Äôs really hard to get in contact with anybody from the company in regards to troubleshooting why the lights won‚Äôt turn on ???

"This light stand is cheaply made and broke after only a few uses. For as expensive as it is, it should not have broken. I tried to contact their customer service team to see if they could help replace the broken part, or if they could point me in the right direction to buy the piece to fix it, and they were very unhelpful, and said that the product was not under warranty so they couldn‚Äôt help with anything. Very disappointing poor customer service. The large heavy ring light sits on top of  skinny stand with a cheap piece of plastic connecting the two pieces together, this is the part where it broke. I was able to find the piece online, and hopefully it will work to fix this piece of junk, but it really would have been great if their customer service team would have stepped up to help at lest show me where I could buy the replacement piece. I would not recommend or repurchase.",1,1,2020-5-24,1,1,1
I made the mistake of getting the UBeesize ring light first! It was total garbage (you get what you pay for). The light didn‚Äôt work and it was cheaply made; I don‚Äôt get the hype! I can only suspect I stumbled upon fake reviews because the light I got was trash. So I decided to pay a bit more and invest in the NEEWER ring light; WOW! I instantly could tell the product was made of quality material and it included a very nice carrying bag too. With COVID19 going on I was unable to shoot my new headshots for my commercial agent and needed to update my pics for a job I‚Äôm up for. This ring light made a huge difference; the Bluetooth selfie controller synced to my iPhone XS seamlessly! The ring light gets SUPER BRIGHT and can easily move from dim to blinding in seconds! Well worth the money! Also the seller Yishi was awesome! I communicated I was unable to track my package and he emailed me immediately. Yishi personally contacted UPS for me and it arrived shortly after. Above and beyond service. I‚Äôll update in a couple months to make sure the light still generates the same level of brightness etc. So far so good! Just pay a bit more and spare yourself the drama!

"Upon arrival I was very excited to receive item. The first few videos and trips the item worked fine. Now I barely use it because I have to rig it for the item to stand in place. I am extremely disappointed my tripod and stand are already falling apart and it has been less than a year since purchase. One of the legs is extremely loose and the mount to hold my phone, not only barely fits around my phone but has completely fallen apart and I have to duck tape together to use. I am an online content creator and a fashion consultant. I like to take images of myself and my clients and I bought this because the case for travel, however, I find the case provides little to no protection for the pieces that really need to be protected, like the legs and the mount.",2,1,2018-7-2,1,3,0
"Price point is high for this. Don't let all the 5 star reviews fool you. For the price, I was expecting a much more solid product. The halo light itself seems very good, and bright. The tripod is very flimsy and cheap. I would not trust it under many working conditions. The tripod after all, is what is holding the main attraction of this product, plus your costly phone or ipad. Plus the mount itself that is attached to the light is very cheaply made. I would probably just return this if I did not have to use it the next couple weeks. I would recommend looking at other options to this light.",3,1,2019-11-23,1,2,0
"Omgosh I love this thing so much!!! I'm a bit of a perfectionist which sucks when you are trying to create product reviews via video for YouTube. It can literally take you hours to film one product review if you have terrible lighting that goes in and out with the Sun, especially if you live in an apartment with limited windows that are facing the Sun. Another day you might have too much sun and be completely washed out. This ring light will calm so much of my anxiety that I have around filming! I have been sitting on the fence about getting a ring light for over a year and I'm kicking myself now for how much literal hours I wasted when I could have just forked over the money and been satisfied all along. So far so good, worth every penny!!!",5,1,2019-6-26,1,2,0
"I use this lamp while doing manicures and pedicures. I like the different levels of brightness however, I thought it was an excellent purchase but I found out later that it wasn't. The Bar that holds the light has bent because of the weight of the light and also because of the weight, it tips over. I use a weighted shopping bag to hold it down and as you can see it wasn't strong enough to anchor it and it fell down. It has fallen on me and last night it tipped over again and this time it hit the floor. This is terrible and dangerous not only for me but my clients as well! I hope Amazon will do something about this so that it doesn't happen to anyone else again.",1,1,2019-6-25,1,2,1
"First, the light is AMAZING!  Its the perfect amount of lighting that I need and eliminates my other lights that take up so much room. I love the dimmer switch to control the amount of light I need for creating my art.  The reason I am giving this only a 3 is because the tripod sucks.  I am sure its ok if the light is set to sit straight up, but I need it to be at a 45 degree angle to face my table.  It can not handle the weight of this lamp, its the large 18 inch lamp.  It leans really bad, in fact I tried to raise it up a little high so it wouldn't be too close to the table and it leans really bad.  I had to make lots of adjustments to make it hold the weight for the angle that I need the lamp.  The goose neck part is nice, but I ended up not using it, it created another problem on its own.  It is a strong goose-neck and holds its shape very well.  But adding that part to extend the lamp out a little made the leaning part of the tripod even worse and was tipping over. Even with the light aligned with the foot.  I know how to use a tripod and understand how the balance works, so I feel that I set this up correctly.  I am going to keep this because I dont want to give up the awesome light.  Maybe later I will hunt for a better tripod.  My suggestion is to get the lamp separately and find a different way to support it.",3,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
"I'll say I'm a bit miffed that this now sells for about half of what I paid in May. Had I gotten that low price I might given a better rating.Like the headline says, this isn't professional-grade gear. This is for regular people who either want more light to help with makeup or someone like me who just wants to put some well-lit photos online. In that respect, the ring light does what it says on the tin.",3,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"I would leave a 3, maybe 4 star rating if not for the scammy way that this light was sold to me. It was on a lightning deal where I got it for $80 before tax, saying that it's originally $99. Immediately after shipping it out the price went back down to its every day price of $74. Meaning they upped the price and put a lightning deal on it to trick people into paying more than the regular price for it. After that I can no longer trust ""lightning deals"" and I especially cannot trust this company for scamming people into overpaying for a simple light. As far as the light goes, it's ok. Nothing special. It's hard to set it up properly and the phone holder is a joke, it won't stay put for a moment so do NOT trust this thing to hold your $1,000+ cameras. I would return it and order a different one, or the same one to get the money back that they scammed me for, but that's a lot of trouble and I feel bad returning anything during a deadly pandemic. So you win this time Neewer, but if you want to keep the customers you get then stop scamming them.",2,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"This light is great for me taking pictures of my Wig Work. I was about to pay hundreds for a photoshoot for my wigs for my Website but was advised to try it myself first.

"Pros: The ring light itself is really bright, and the diffuser pieces that snap on to it work great. I love that part.  It also has an external power supply, so if anything happens you can easily replace that.Cons: The stand has these obnoxiously long legs and taking it down to transport it is inconvenient and time consuming.  Most stands have the legs attached to a center piece that you simply pull up along the center shaft which automatically pulls all the legs in simultaneously.  Think of how a speaker stand works.  This stand however does not work anything like this although it has three legs that are connected together.  The legs fold vertically along the shaft, however the feet are pointing towards the sky, so you have to fully extend the legs parallel to the ground first, which takes up a lot of surface area, and then you kinda have to move all three legs simultaneously to get it to fold up (which wouldn't be difficult if we had four hands).  It's just incredibly annoying to deal with.  Also, it has a few components that interconnect to allow the ring light to be mounted to the stand.  All of these components just seem to be knobs that you tighten with no real locking mechanism that protects the ring light from lopping over if something gets loose.  So it feels very flimsy and unsecure.  If you're using this in one place that you don't intend to move it too much, it's fine, but for a make up artist that's on the go, this will frustrate you.  If you can find a better stand that the ring light can be mounted on, you'll love it though, because the ring light itself is a beast.  The stand is just garbage.",4,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0

"I spent $142 on this on May 17th... price dropped to $99 in LESS THAN 6 WEEKS! I just happened to see a suggestion which led me to this look for how much I paid for this light...The suggestion was for a $150 (+tax) ring light made by PIXEL.... Newer had the exactly same light that I really wanted in May, but it $200 and was far out of my budget...

"On the one I have, which was the same price (this one had a coupon so I bought it instead) it had a nob for brightness and one for hue.  This has pain in the butt panels that you have to snap in and out.  I happen to be using this in the same place inside of my office, so I only have to find the right lighting once.

Extremely irritating as it never even looked good doing either pictures or videos. It always looked overly bright white. Very stark and harsh. So unhappy.

"Baby! Grab a seat bc I gotta tell you about this ring light. It is awesome, it comes well packaged and in a cute little carrying case. The case is large enough to carry the light and all of its accessories to include any additional pieces you may want to purchase later, like a mirror *insert Rihanna side eye* but we‚Äôll get back to that later. It also has two side pockets on the inner sides of the case, I use mine for the 2 different light covers that are provided. That case has a little handle and an adjustable strap that makes it easy to carry. The light itself is of a very good quality, it gets super bright, like sunshine bright, and can dim all the way down. The Tripod is easily manipulated to adjust to however you want it. I like that I didn‚Äôt have to do too much screwing on with the tripod. The only things that you actually have to screw on is the light, the cell holder and the bendy extension piece. The two covers for the light (yellow/white) snap onto the light and slide into place. Each color has thee pieces to complete the ring. There are two screw holes to attach a mirror (sold separately). The fact that the mirror didn‚Äôt come included was a downer, but hey my fault for jumping to conclusions and not reading the product description *Kanye shrug*. It comes with a little pod, to take pictures and or start/stop a video recording. You just hold it on your hand and discreetly press the button and bam! Flawless! The pod is easily synced to your smartphone via Bluetooth and has a on/off switch to make sure the battery doesn‚Äôt drain while it‚Äôs not in use.Ok full disclosure on this part: I bypassed reading the instructions on how to assemble the thing because 1.

I also like that I can adjust the angle of the light--the top section of the tripod is bendable, and it holds the light in place well in any position.  I like the carrying case it comes with--it seems fairly sturdy and is padded to protect the equipment.  Lastly, I love the bluetooth remote that came with the kit.  I was able to easily connect it to my phone, which then allowed me to start and stop my phone's camera.

I also love that my phone can attach to the light, which helps me easily get my lighting and camera angle in the best spot.

"My wife started teaching her fitness classes at home on zoom, like so many others.  We struggled with getting good light.  We tried a shop light with a sheet over it, floor lights, overhead lights and natural lighting but still struggled each day.  I bought the 18"" ring light and it has worked well.  Fully adjustable, easy to use.Only complaint is the phone mount that is in the center of the ring doesn't accommodate a large phone with protective outer box.  It is designed for an iphone I think so if you have a Samsung 8,9 or 10 it will not fit well.  Also doesn't rotate to the vertical position.  We used a bean bag to set it up with some tape and it works rigged up.",5,1,2020-5-12,1,0,0
"This ring light is an awesome addition to any photographers kit. It works well with the included plastic snap-on diffusers, the cord is a decent length, and the brightness control gives you a good range. It isn't SUPER bright and doesn't have the best fill range, but for close up work and good soft portrait lighting it is very nice. The carrying case is definitely handy, and everything stores pretty neatly inside of it. The camera mount can feel a bit wonky with a full DSLR camera and lens attached, and the mount for placing it on a tripod isn't the sturdiest when tightened, but for the price it does the trick. Neewer has always been a 5-10 for me, meaning that many of their features and materials on a given product are a 10/10 while certain aspects, such as mounts or cables, are 5/10. But overall they seem to always be worth having in your inventory. This product is definitely one of the better pieces to have.",5,1,2019-7-25,1,0,1
"I thought the tripod was useless, so flimsy and wobbly and would bend under weight and almost tip over.  Not substantial.  It comes with a gooseneck mount so you can direct the circle light, but if you do lean it out there, the tripod wants to tip over. I got rid of the tripod and just mounted it to a substantial stand which I also purchased :  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096JYRY6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1The light lights things up well, wish it had some color temperature... it only has a dimmer, so getting the color temperature you need is a challenge.  You better like blueish light.",2,1,2018-9-14,1,1,0
"Product works sort of. The light part is great. Minus one start for the whole assembly being flimsy and swaying in windy conditions outdoors or even indoors after adjusting the light till it finally comes to rest. Also minus one star for not providing an offset piece that would elevate the smartphone more into the center of the ring. Smartphone fits OK when used in vertical orientation, doesn't fit well when used in horizontal orientation. The part exists but was not included in this version of the kit. It isn't missing from this kit, it purposefully isn't part of it. Also, haven't tried it with a heavy DLSR but I doubt that the assembly is stable enough for it. Decent hobbyist light.",3,1,2020-6-7,1,0,1
"I'm a digital creator and do a lot of product reviews  and this ring light is professional production quality. It gets so bright and also comes with the 3 orange plates for saturation. You can put 1, 2 or all 3 orange plates depending on the saturation level you want. It comes with a remote for easy stop and go filming. Even on social media applications like Snapchat, you can hold the remote down as long as you want to record a video. I absolutely loved this purchase!!! No regrets at all!",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,1
"I‚Äôm giving it two stars because when I first got it, I was impressed because the ring light was very bright and I thought it was worth over $100. However, I tried using it again after two days of having it and it wouldn‚Äôt turn on. Then after leaving it ‚Äúon‚Äù for a few seconds the lights were beginning to turn on but it was very weak and the lights were pulsating. My experience with this ring light was very similar to someone else‚Äôs review on this product. I should‚Äôve taken that review more in consideration before buying. I‚Äôm definitely going to return it.",2,1,2019-2-16,1,2,0
"SIZE MATTERS. I already had a 10"" ring light but this one just took my filming/selfie game from 0 to 100. It's very bright, & can light up an entire room without a problem. The orange plastic attachments are awesome & and give you the option to mix and match to create a warmer ""filter."" Set up is easy, easier if you've already set up a ring light in the past, but basically everything is common sense & just a little tip: the legs of the stand come outside-in so you need to push them all the way backwards so the screw on tip of the stand is on the top. It's worth the money.",5,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"I use this ring light for absolutely everything I‚Äôm actually thinking about purchasing a second one,  my only complaint is the shortage in the cord,  but other than that definitely a great bye!",5,1,2020-9-20,1,2,1
"The ease of set up and the quality of this light will be phenomenal for my webinars.  With a little tutorial from a friend ( who is a videography professional), I am set up for success along with my Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920 (also purchased via Amazon).  This in combination with using a gorilla pod wrapped around the light...I am so stoked for my webinars and teaching production.  Love the carrying case but I plan to already have things set up.",5,1,2019-1-8,1,1,0
Ive purchased 3 of these lights from Neewer over the years. These lights are amazing.I have had my first light for 1 year and 5 months and it still operates normally.,5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,1
"The light itself is great, but the STAND can be improved a lot. It feels like one wrong move and something can break or the stand can TOPPLE over since it will be very top heavy with the light. All of the locks on it are also screws that seem to be made of plastic, and over time will probably wear down and not be able to lock anymore. It is definitely a product you want to be gentle with. I keep it up 24/7, only because I don't know if leaving it up all the time or disassembling it and assembling every time I need to use it would cause more damage. Also, another important thing to note, it comes with an AWFUL PHONE HOLDER. The holder feels like it can break each time you put your phone in, and it cannot keep the phone in place. Your phone, unless you balance it perfectly, will just roll around not secured. On top of this the bump on the bottom of the light intrudes on your phones space, and can make it difficult to use because the phone holder has no height adjustment. I also used the stand to hold a DSLR camera and I can honestly say I was terrified to leave it on the stand for even a second by itself. I think the Neewer ring light was great, but the stand left me very disappointed after I payed $100 for it.",4,1,2020-3-10,1,1,1
"I just started a Youtube channel, saw that lighting was the most important part of a video, and so I decided to buy this light in particular because ring lights are a Youtube staple, and this one is very inexpensive. I was able to put it together myself (before I found the instructions in the box) and when I turned it on it made a HUGE difference in my video quality (filming on my smartphone.) You can see my full review and the difference it made in my video aesthetics on my channel, GlamByKam. The video is called NEEWER 18"" RING LIGHT | REVIEW + UNBOXING + SETUP. Hope this helps if you're on the fence about buying it.",5,1,2018-9-16,1,2,0
"I ordered this light last week and when it came it I was so happy! I had been searching for a good ring light for months until I decided to purchase this one. I figured out how to put it together and initially it worked perfectly, but when I tried to turn the light on again, it wouldn't turn on.  After fidgeting with the connection plug (twisting it, unplugging and re plugging it, wrapping it around the stem) eventually I got it to stay on. I only worry though that it will only get worse and eventually it will not be fixed with cord placement. Debating if I should return it.",3,1,2018-11-25,1,2,0
"Edit June 10, 2020: I contacted the seller about the faulty stand and they were amazing and courteous. They sent me a replacement and I received it today. So changed my review to 5 stars because it's an awesome ring light and they have great customer service too.Love this ring light! The only reason for the four stars is that one of the tripod legs is a little loose and won't stay as I want it to, but don't want the hassle of a return since it's a great light.",5,1,2020-5-6,1,0,1
I chose this one with the carrying/storage case because I assumed it would be worth it but I honestly never use the bag because it so involved to set up and take down this setup - usually fold it up most of the way and stick in the corner until I want to use it again. I also think the tinted light covers are way too orange and create a weird shadowy glow that isn't really flattering or natural looking. That being said the stand is very adjustable which is nice and you can precisely adjust the light levels - great for multi-dimensional shots or indoor/outdoor use. It's a pretty good price for the quality and would be a great introductory set,3,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
This ring light is just amazing. I‚Äôm a television reporter and have to shoot my own tape pieces because of the pandemic. I was not going to catch myself looking a mess on TV with bad lighting! This was easy to set up and makes me look better than I‚Äôve ever looked even in studio lighting! My executives and everyone noticed! I got a cell phone rig that holds my phone horizontally because vertical video is not good for TV and this 20 dollar rig holds my wireless mic on a hot shoe mount and I sound great too! Bad audio and bad lighting is the worst but trust me this is the solution!!!,5,1,2020-8-23,1,0,1
"I was very much looking forward to this ring light, and for the price I was not expecting much. But much does not mean that the tripod would not fit well on one of the extensions, so i could not raised it much, and that after a couple of uses with the light on it fell down, gladly it felt over a bed, so the light suffered no damage. Even though I always have the care to place the light towards one of the legs, same use as with a camera tripod.So story short I had  to buy  a new stand.",3,1,2019-3-7,1,1,0
"Hey! One of my 2020 goals was to get back on Youtube and make more content for you. One of the things that had been on my Amazon wish list for a while was this ring light w/stand.I tried to have it delivered to an Amazon locker (my preferred mode of delivery for Amazon orders), but the packaging was too large. As you can see in the video (my youtube: ShannonEMaher) the original box is quite large. The kit is in another box inside the box. I took everything out and ‚Äî as you can see ‚Äî it comes with a zipper case for everything, and two filters for the bulbs (white and orange).",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,1
This is a great light for what I'm needing it for-amateur photography. My of my pictures are taken in my home so this light really steps the shot up and makes the lighting look beautiful and even. The only compliant I have is the is the phone holder that can be connected to the light is very limited. There is not an option to angle the phone forward or up without moving the entire light with it. I typically have to use a separate tripod for my phone. Maybe there is a better add on that you purchase that will work better but the one that comes with the light isn't that great.,4,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"This ringlight is fantastic! I had gotten a small one for cosplay self-shoots and TikToks, but the tripod didn‚Äôt hold my phone very well and I just didn‚Äôt like it. My friend had this one and recommended it to me. I used it at her house and immediately bought my own. I use it regularly. The height is adjustable, which is nice since I‚Äôm short and most of my friends are taller, so if we do anything together it‚Äôs an easy adjustment. It‚Äôs also VERY BRIGHT. I‚Äôve never used it on full brightness though I have blinded myself turning it on while standing in front of it.I especially like to use it while taking photos with my phone in ‚Äúportrait mode‚Äù with ‚Äúcontour lighting.‚Äù Doing it that way requires very little editing, if any.",5,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
"Whenever I see multiple 5 star Reviews I'm always wary. I was excited about this product, it has over 7,000 reviews including videos. But once it arrived and set up I knew I'd gotten bamboozled. Firstly it did not turn on. At all. Secondly it's made very cheaply. If it did work I wouldn't pay more than 40. Marketed beautifully but really a Lemon. Spend a little more money and save yourself some headache.",1,1,2020-5-15,1,1,0
I use this almost every day. I take a lot of photos for my online reselling business and had heard about ring lights. My friend issues 2 in his hair salon. They have a know that dims or brightens the light. The stand can be raised or lowered and has a nice storage case. This was so much less then what a photography store were selling the same thing for.,5,1,2020-9-7,1,1,0
"You‚Äôd think because it‚Äôs expensive it‚Äôll actually be worth something, purchased a little over a month ago I‚Äôve probably used it 6 times. A few days ago it just shut off and has not come back on. I‚Äôm very disappointed this is so inconvenient and trifling I wouldn‚Äôt recommend! my friend purchased after me and is having the same issue only hers comes on occasionally.",1,1,2020-7-21,1,3,1
"This light changed the game for me in every aspect possible! Wow is all I have to say. It was so incredibly easy to setup and would work perfect for freelance MUAs who travel because it‚Äôs incredibly easy to take apart and set back up. The height is adjustable and I imagine goes extremely high, Ive only ever had to use the first 2 extenders and I believe there is 4? Maybe 5. So she‚Äôs incredibly tall. The quality is out of this world, not flimsy in any sort of way. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this ring light, it fits my MUA/MUE lifestyle perfectly.",5,1,2019-9-15,1,1,1
"I love my ring light because I can see very little nook and cranny that the face has. As a licensed Cosmetologist and certified Makeup Artist, I needed a  ring light that I can use and functions properly so that I can post pictures of the hair and makeup that I do.  This light has a little knob you can turn to shine the exact amount of light you need for excellent pictures. Another wonderful quality is that it comes with a tripod and the instructions are super easy to use.  The Neewer Ring Light also comes with a carrying case which is beneficial if you have weddings, special occasions, SFX, etc, and it is light to carry and portable. I absolutely recommend it. I love my ring light!",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,1
"NEEWER is not new to the game. It has become one of the top ring lights and for good reason! I have been waiting for years to get my hands on one, and I'm so incredibly glad I have one now! This light is everything I need. I also use it for a room lamp because my space does not have overhead lighting. It is great. I love it and highly recommend to anyone in photography, gaming, streaming, or just in need of some great lighting for a space.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,1,0
"When the light works, the brightness is great for photography and task lighting.  HOWEVER, the switch breaks EXTREMELY quickly.  We've purchased several of these units for work and half of the lighting switches broke within a few months.  They stop making the full connection required to turn on the light and the switch even appears loose and will even move backwards a little on its own when released. Lots of people online have posted about the same issue so Neewer clearly has a serious problem with the design.  They're responsive with emails alerting them to this problem, but inconsistent with the information provided.  Some purchasers with this same problem have posted on Amazon and other sites that Neewer mailed them a replacement part.  With us, they were unwilling to mail parts and are insisting we, at our expense, ship them the light to be fixed.  The shipping cost is about the same price as a new light so it their ""solution"" not an option.  It's pretty bad customer service to tell some purchasers they'll ship the part to them but not to others.  Neewer needs to fix the design flaw that seems to plague their lights.  If the faulty switch problem is fixed, it would be a great light.  While responsiveness is nice with customer service, if it doesn't actually solve the problem, it's just a way for dissatisfied customers to be superficially placated.  The other option is for Neewer to price the light more in line with a disposable product - once in awhile there will be promo code out there for 50% off - that's the only time it's worth the price  But at the current price, it's far too much money for the quality.",1,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0
"This ring light doesn‚Äôt work. I barely ordered on May 2019, don‚Äôt remember the exact day. I opened the box from amazon. Inside was the box from Neewer with my ring light. After 2 weeks I only used this ring light 5 times! Only five times! And now it doesn‚Äôt want to turn on. It looks like if the little (dot) lights don‚Äôt want to turn on. Nobody else is around my ring light, I did take care of my ring light and now it does not work. This is not fair. I was looking for a great ring light but this was not the one. I trusted the brand NEEWER. Now I see it‚Äôs not real! This is a real disappointment.  People, be careful. Do not spend your money on this if you are limited economically.I did try to return it and i hope I can do that.",1,1,2019-6-5,1,2,0
"I would like to say that this light is very bright and is helpful for getting good lighting as a makeup artist working in unpredictable situations. The crappy thing about this light is that it is so terribly made. Everything always comes apart when I put it back in the bag for travel. There are these filter panels over the actual light that always come off and is a pain to put back on. Also, when I place the ring on the tri-pod, I legit feel like it might fall over and it has once. It's like the light is too big for the tripod. They should really work on improving the quality of the product. I would rather save up and purchase ""The Makeup Light"" next time.",2,1,2019-7-15,1,1,0
"My original cell phone clip holder recently broke- the spring had always been incredibly difficult to maneuver. Neewer sent this new version, which screws/unscrews to hold phone in place and change direction. It is such a WONDERFUL improvement on the old phone holder! Thumbs up to Neewer for this!The only thing I would change on this ring light model is that I wish the tint of the lights could also be adjusted via a knob like the brightness. I'm constantly having to switch the orange and white plates out to light myself properly, and sometimes I wish there was a more in-between shade. One of the tripod legs is also a little bit looser than the others, causing the rig to tilt slightly at times. Other than that, not to shabby for a model existing under $100, which had been my main concern when first purchasing. It definitely does the trick for online meetings and providing great  light for video recordings!",4,1,2020-7-12,1,0,1
"I had to order this product twice. The first time it was shipped via Amazon and on delivery day I got a message that it was damaged and undeliverable.  Amazon told me to order another one.  Seems to me they would have automatically shipped a replacement.  I was afraid I was going to lose the coupon value I had used, but fortunately it was still valid.  As an added note, I contacted my seller, Global_omo, about my concerns, and they were very prompt and nice in their response.The second one was shipped via UPS and arrived in good condition. The product box was packed in a bigger box that was about one to two inches bigger than the product box all around.  There was a single sheet of brown wrapping paper laid on top of the product box. I really don‚Äôt know the purpose of the paper, what it was supposed to protect.  It certainly couldn‚Äôt secure the product box and the product box could easily slide around.  Fortunately it was undamaged.",4,1,2019-8-16,1,0,0
"Im really happy with this ring light and it works great!! Easy to set up, easy to store away. I like the stepless brightness dial and the option to have warm or cool filters. I do think the iPhone hold feels like it could break over time and putting it in vertical position with the ring light is a little tight. I also would never mount a real DSLR on that holder, just have a solid tripod hold the camera and put the ring light around it. I wouldn‚Äôt say this product is perfect, but it definitely does its job well.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
First off I received my ring light got delivered. I was excited to open the box. The box looked like it had been open before but that was no big deal because everything came in peace and all there.

"This is my second ring light I have ordered. Ad a pro makeup artist best lighting is imperitive. I ha e even sent other artists the link to order the same light as I love how the light itself works. I am, however, disappointed in how easy the tripod has broken on me twice and how the light doesn‚Äôt stay on the position you angle it as I feel it‚Äôs just too top heavy for the tripod. This is my second one to order as I had my first one and the tripod broke about 6 months in. So I just ordered another one. And it cracked less than a month of using it. Now I get to order another one and I just feel money wasted.",2,1,2018-7-16,1,2,1
Love Neewer products in general. It's great that they run on the lower end $$ helps us people and YouTubers on a budget.Check me out on Instagram: brunomarques18 and there's a link to my YouTube channel and you can see the difference on my video lighting and quality of the picture.

"Ive been wanting a ring light and finally bought this one when it was on sale! Love it. I sell clothes online , youtube, and streaming. I first went with those other studio lightings with 3-4 stands but that takes up to much space and setting up or putting away was such a drag. So this ring light is just so much more convenient.",5,1,2019-2-18,1,4,1
"I‚Äôve been trying to find a LED ring light for the longest time, however, my budget always stopped me. I came across this one the other night and I thought I‚Äôd give it a try. It is perfect, you can adjust the height, it has the screens for white or ‚Äútan‚Äù effect, it brings the adapter for the phone, super easy to use, and it brings its own case and bluetooth clicker. Very good quality in everything and super bright (which you have the option to dim). So if you‚Äôre looking for one and don‚Äôt have much experience or space, this is perfect!",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"Day One - 7/29/20This LED ring light is guaranteed to light AT LEAST an entire 10'√ó15' room just like daylight. In the photos I included one warm light cover and left an empty slot to show what each looks like when lit. It's definitely 18"" - a lot larger than your average table ring light. It can be used for many different types of photography, both indoors and out! The phone holder is kind of awkward to mess with but it still works for what it is and grips the phone securely. My last concern is the stand; it's much lighter than expected and the legs are quite thin. The light itself is just under 3lbs. I'm clumsy, so I fear I will bump it and easily tip it over.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,1,1
"I'm not sure if everyone's is like this, but I do a lot of product photography for my boutique and let me tell you, this thing is not adaptable. I sometimes need to raise it really high or have it really low and it is so top heavy that it falls over. Not only that the adjustments are so weak that the legs are constantly spreading apart. I was really looking forward to this because it's an 18 in and it was recommended to me, but the person who recommended it, leaves it in one spot all the time where I'm constantly needing to take it on the move. The worst part, is when I have it set up and I'm not moving it because I need it in the same spot the next day, you have to unplug it every where it plugs in (light to adapter, adapter to the wall), just to get it to turn on. Sometimes it takes minutes before it will even turn on at all.",2,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
I love my ring light. The lightning has different setting that you can adjust to your liking. The lightning is perfect for videos/photos. Very easy to put together and comes with instructions. My photos are going to look amazing! I‚Äôd definitely recommend to friends/family.,5,1,2020-3-24,1,2,0
Update! I see all the reviews about this ring light that is fantastic? How fantustic if i may asked? Trying to ahoot facing the ground for product phitography and this thing just doesnt stay still where is supposed to! It doesn't  matter how many times i get up to tighten up the knobs it still bends all down completely. Thats one. Two: my Canon i cannot move in different positions? I need to shoot in portrait fir website clothing pictures (boutique) and i cannot change my canin position. Three my phone it's so low thst also i can't  move it around. It gets stuck in the middle of that half way circle white part of the ring light with those black edges for screws to put on i believe.

"This is a great product and a great deal for all that you get.  First, it's a tripod that is taller than me and taller than I can even reach.  It seems sturdy and well-made.  Second, it has a large ring light you can attach to the tripod that has 2 different color diffusers.  Third, it even comes with a little remote control that pairs through Bluetooth with your cell phone, and which can be used independently of the tripod and ring light.  The whole thing was a little intimidating, but took only 10 minutes to assemble.",5,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"This light is the best purchase that I made this year, I am so happy. I have a YouTube channel (Marisa Rose) and I hated they I couldn't film at night or when it was overcast without my videos looking bad. I plan on filming a video on my channel showing solely the before and after since there are so many unboxing videos. When I was looking into buying this, I just wanted to see what a difference it would make and I wish I had been able to see more. Hopefully the photos that I attached with help someone decide if they want this. It is dimmable and has a wide range of brightness. It is not hard to put together at all and can light up even the darkest room. Love the affordable price as well. Thank you :)",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,1
"The light itself is really good, BUT the ring brings two different options for the tone of the light. That keeps falling off even when I readjust it.Also, the tripod is not stable. It's come to a point to which I cannot even use the ring light at all unless I place it on the floor which is is totally annoying because the On/Off switch is in the bottom part if you place it on a flat surface, you can't hold your phone with the ring light phone holder.",2,1,2020-4-30,1,0,0

"This is probably my third ring light, but my first time buying this brand and I can safely say that I will now be a life long happy customer. This style is so much better than my other older ones and comes with a phone holder, mount, and camera remote for easy shooting by yourself. The led bulbs are scattered across the interior of the light and really balance the tone. I can use it in the US and Europe with the interchangeable adapters, tested and they both work well. Everything is top notch!",5,1,2018-10-25,1,3,0
"For the time it was working, this ring light was a very reliable product. However after 3 months, be power supply for the light became highly unreliable.I work in an area with considerable backlight and this light helped me offset the back light from the sun during professional business meetings.

"I did a good deal of research online and watched several videos on YouTube (assembly and reviews) prior to purchasing this ring light and finally I ordered it. It arrived very well packaged and was very easy to assemble.  After I placed my order I started second guessing myself on the size thinking maybe I should have ordered the next size down or two.  Brought out the measuring tape a few times still second guessing my decision and I am so glad I did not change my mind. This light on it's highest setting (which I did not take a picture of) is insane.  The size is absolutely perfect!  I love how easy it is to assemble and use, love the twist knob for the dimmer, love how lightweight it is and the case that it comes with is very high-quality for ease of portability.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,1
"Everything works well but the top reason I bought it for DOESnot work! I waited until I used it couple times and the Bluetooth control doesn't work well, it never disconnects the bottom to snap the shutter on the control doesn't work all the time and that is annoying because I found myself constantly standing next to my customer pressing camera button on the iPhone myself when I could have helped customers not being a selfie shot attendant (used it an an expo event).",4,1,2019-9-23,1,0,0
"I got this light. I set it up. It worked. I used it a second time. It was quirky, but eventually came on. Last night when I actually need it to work. It wouldn't power on. I brought it home. The power supply is working. It appears to be a problem with the main unit. This light has been turned on for less than a 1/2 hour. Very frustrating.",1,1,2019-7-21,1,1,0
I got this in December. It did not come with the phone timer and phone tripod connector. The white panels dont match up so you can't have all 4 on at once. Honestly I managed to overlook that but now I'm in June and the thing collapsed on me and none of adjustments are working. I regret ever buying this.,1,1,2020-6-28,1,1,0
Awesome ring light - I purchased a NEEWER Ring Light 4 years ago and this one is soo much better. only giving 4 stars because mine didn't come with the adapter part for the smartphone mount. Sucks. My first order actually got lost and I had to reorder and now this one is missing the mount that sticks onto the ring light but seems to for some reason have just the expandable smartphone mount part (the one that you put your smartphone into).,4,1,2020-7-27,1,1,0
"My hair salon has had one for a long time and I always take pics with it when I go there... so I finally invested in one myself, and it was the best purchase ever. I mean the price is amazing and it comes with a freaking Bluetooth remote to take pics with your phone. Like how could you not buy one? My selfie game is hella strong now y‚Äôall.",5,1,2018-4-2,1,2,0
"Great light for selfies, art or for videography! Easy to carry around due to lightweight design although can be difficult to put back in bag. Had some difficulty with getting the phone attachment to hold a larger cell (iPhone 7+) but worked well with the smaller phones. Light is bright and you can change the power to adjust to your specific need. Great value!",5,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
"Although it has great light quality, it is very unstable. There isn‚Äôt a time that we use it that I don‚Äôt worry about it falling over and breaking. I wish it was possible to buy a new base separately. Maybe I will follow up with customer service... for the money I expected better",3,1,2018-6-17,1,4,0
"The ring light sits a bit heavy for the tripod but just angle it right and I should be good to go. It includes two filter options which are plastic covers for either white or warmer (orange) light. Wireless remote is a cute option but not the best function as it didn't always work. The tripod can accommodate screw in style accessories like phone or iPad mini holsters. The ring light must be plugged in which can get tricky if you're not close to a power outlet so be prepared to have an extension. The light is super bright and has several settings but usually people don't want it too bright for when I use it at parties especially if the lights in the room are out, the light is more than enough at the first or second setting. I really enjoy this light and it's a perfect beginners kit that makes it look like you're a pro!!!!",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
I really like this light kit.  I photograph my clients before and after pictures to use in allowing them to see the difference my services do for them.  My pictures before I got the ring kit were okay but not real either.  The light ring kit has changed that for me and my pictures are really good now using the same camera.  I am very impressed with this product and recommend it for those who want to make their photos pop.,5,1,2019-8-18,1,0,0
The light itself is 5 stars. Super bright and once you pop on the diffuser leaves a nice soft glow. Problem is it is made so cheap and flimsy.  Stand fell apart on second use and clip to attach light to stand is a cheap flimsy plastic.  The lights to heavy so it doesn‚Äôt hold it straight and all my video is slightly crooked. It could be amazing if they just made at attachments a little more solid.  Until then it got returned,2,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"I have just started using this product and I love the way the light works with pictures HOWEVER, sadly the stand is very unstable!! I am worried when I put any devices on it that it may fall. I just discovered today there is a pin that is missing from the stand. so the bottom portion is just ready to fall out anytime!I love the light itself but if the stand isnt sturdy. I do not know if that pin was lost in transit or if it was ever there since I have never seen it. I went through all the boxes and nothing. I do not know what to do so if anyone has stands they can recommend please comment below. Otherwise be aware this one isnt really worth it, just buy the light and find a different stand.",4,1,2018-8-24,1,0,0
This item came as a international European plug shown on the photo that I attached . I‚Äôm from America . Not only that before I purchased this I read every detail of this listing and not once it mentioned  European plug.  I brought this with my prime membership  account to get it one or two business days to film today and now it a waste  of time. I can‚Äôt film the way I wanted too . Very unprofessional . Also it didn‚Äôt even come with the bag that it stated it was suppose to come with. How do you just make mistakes like that?! I can‚Äôt even use this ring kit . Honestly  returning it and never making business with ya‚Äôll again .,1,1,2019-10-8,1,0,1
"My husband bought this for me as a gift, been wanting something like this for a while! I love it! You can adjust the lighting with the small knob that‚Äôs on it. The ring light is big! Great for salons, makeup artists, bloggers, selfies, the list goes on! It‚Äôs easy to carry in the carry bag that it comes with, but I wish you could also fit the ring lights stand in the bag too. The stand makes the lighting adjustable too at different angles, side, up, down tilt etc. and you can also add on a phone holder in the middle too sold separately.",5,1,2019-11-21,1,0,0
This was easy to set up but I did look at instructions to make sure I didn‚Äôt do any of the ‚ÄúDont‚Äôs‚Äù. Very bright ring light.  Has an attachment for either cell phone or go pro or camera.  Also the Bluetooth remote that paired with my iPhone XS Max is a plus.  I can set up my cell and have the remote in my hand to capture pictures. At first i didn‚Äôt know whether to put both color filter plastics or one but I figured out you choose one.  Very sturdy feeling comes with carrying case and I love that you can dim the light to your liking.,5,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
Must have for any photographer/videographer. Ideal even if you're on a budget. The tripod is sturdy and folds down so it's very manageable for transporting when compacted. I use it as my main light source and it adequately gives me all the light I need. The dimmer works wonderful for adjusting various lighting situations. I mostly use these for making videos on my phone with the included mount for my youtube channel. I have found the quality of the videos to be much better now that I have a real set up. I can take it anywhere since all the pieces are detachable and I use the carrying case to make it easier to transport the ring light to different locations to film. Very happy with the lighting.,5,1,2018-11-19,1,2,0
"I have now had this product in my possession for over a year, and it still seems brand new. It comes with interchangeable plates that you can switch out if you want warm or cool lighting. I've used it with my vlogging camera, as well as my cell phone. I love that you can change the angle and height in any way that you want. Most days I used it upright for direct lighting. I've also used it higher up, facing down, to add light from overhead. I've recorded many videos and took some awesome photos with this ring light. It's easy to store and put away in the carrying case it comes with. Super happy with it!",5,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"I purchased this ring light a little over a month ago based off a friend's recommendation.  When I first turned it on, I noticed that it was glitching and I had to manipulate the cord to make the light stay on.  I didn't think much about it. Well today, I attempted to use the light and it will not turn on.  I have only had this product for 32 days.  I am extremely disappointed.  This ring light is useless and it's past the return date.  If the seller doesn't allow me to replace it, I will be out of $100.00.",1,1,2020-8-19,1,1,0
"I have found this to be a reliable, compact, quiet and pretty handy lighting kit. I've had for a year and it has been easy to set up and break down, always works even if its been months since used. For the price I think it works quite well for illumination! The plastic filter pieces for the lighting ring are a bit cheesey and don't exactly lock in place like I would like but I'm living with it.",4,1,2019-3-6,1,1,0
"So far I've used my smartphone with it. I like the amount of light it shines on the face. Also, that it serves as a tripod. What I really dislike are those solid white circles reflected around your pupils in portraits and in videos. You really have to turn the light way down to soften them. More so in portraits. Making it obvious to everyone you're using a ring light. It would be smart if someone designed one of these with maybe the camera holder on the side of the ring light or beneath it (I'm not a lighting expert so not sure which would work better) instead of the center. Had I known of this effect, I may have rethought my purchase. I also don't like that the phone holder squeezes the hell out of your phone. That should be redesigned. Also, I received a solid neck instead of a flex neck that was advertised both on Amazon as well as on the box. I'm assuming it's because I purchased the larger size and due to the weight of the ring a flex neck would have made the apparatus topple over.",3,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"I love this light. It came with the Bluetooth remote so that I can easily snap photos of myself while servicing my makeup clients. The filters snap on and off easily and I don't feel like I'm about to break anything while changing them. The case fits everything that I need so less stuff to carry. Overall, I would purchase this product again as a gift for anyone who needs it. Stop reading these reviews and add this to your cart already! LOL",5,1,2019-9-3,1,0,0
"I just got my light today, and I LOVE IT. So why three stars you ask? Well because it doesn't work unless you finagle the power cord fixed to the light. There's a short in the wire and if you move the light you risk losing power. Given that there is a short, the light will also turn off at random even if you don't move the cord. I will update this review once customer service mails me back.",3,1,2017-5-4,1,5,0
"Me gusta porque lo puedo llevar donde quiera. El cel solo se puede poner horizontalmente y asi no me sirve, no lo uso, pues me conviene verticalmente. Las luces del anillo encendieron a su maxima potencia, en 4 ocasiones, cuando lo estaba instalando.. luego solo encienden a mediana potencia, a solo minutos de tenerlo en mis manos... es el unico fallo que le ecuentro.. dejo de funcionar la luz a su maxima potencia. Para ser tan caro, este producto, tiene muchos fallos. El bluetooth, todavia no lo uso.",4,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0
"I have been using this regularly for meetings and it has served me really well. It is bright enough and does help brighten up my surroundings. I cannot wait to use it during virtual instruction with my students this fall. For the price, it does include a lot of stuff in it and they are all helpful to keep video, picture taking or just brightening your face up for conference calls. I am not excited for the time when the bulbs will have to be replaced, though. Hopefully, an affordable replacement will be available then.",5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"Tripod does not fit in the soft case with light. The case is made only for the ring light. you'll need another bag to carry the tripod, cords and any accessories you use. I was expecting it all to fit in the case provided, which is important because I'll use this in different locations. Now I realize the illustration in the ad is the box it gets shipped in. Stuffing the tripod in the soft case would certainly damage the light.",4,1,2020-3-22,1,0,1
"The stand for this light is more sturdy than I had expected, the plastic mounting piece on the light itself feels like it could break at any given time. I was impressed with how bright it can get and I love the dimmer. God this thing is bright even Ray Charles could see it a mile away. I received instructions with mine unlike many others, also the mirror for the light was missing. I've purchased Neewer products in the past where items that were supposed to be included came up missing...idk over all I'm happy with it though.",5,1,2018-8-18,1,1,0
"The light would be perfect if the cord didn‚Äôt break so easily, I don‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs been broken twice when I take such good care of it. It doesn‚Äôt sit out after appointments and always gets put back nicely. I even got a warranty because I knew something would happen, they seem to be refusing to help fix it now that it went out the second time (the first time it got sent to me broken, it‚Äôs only the cord box that needs replaced). Very cheap for the price I paid and now they won‚Äôt send a new cord even though I paid extra for that warranty. I never write reviews if this tells you how I‚Äôm feeling. Very disappointed",2,1,2019-6-14,1,1,0
"I enjoy the Ring Light immensely. It definitely does its job in lighting up a room and making a photo or video more appealing to the eye. The extension on the tripod is difficult at first, but I suggest putting the Light on and then adjusting the extension! Otherwise it will be difficult and could be even impossible (I barely was able to make it curve until I added the Ring Light on it, then it moved down no problem). My only complaint is the smart phone holder. Another buyer who had recommended Ring Light had the same issue. The stand is only a bit wider than the average iPhone, in my opinion. My LG Thin cannot fit horizontally or vertically with or without its case, and so I will have to buy a separate stand. Guess I should have expected that since the ad shows an Apple phone only (it doesn't go any taller than that).",4,1,2019-3-6,1,0,0
"Great light, looks to be fairly sturdy and decent quality. Wish the color filter snaps were a bit better designed, and I wish there was more height adjustability. In many situations it‚Äôs just a little too high and there‚Äôs no way to lower it at all.",4,1,2020-8-10,1,1,0
"It's a really great lighting system! I bought it for photographing clothing, actually... I prefer natural light, but I currently live in a dark environment with not a lot of natural light and needed something quick to photograph my clothes. The light is extremely bright and comes with different covers.I'm still trying to figure out the best set-up for me; sometimes I have to readjust the brightness down because it's too bright. I take photos with my iPhone and most of the time the white balance is off, but it could be from other elements.",5,1,2019-10-24,1,1,0
"Cool ring light however the holder for the phone is thick and annoying to deal with and adjust. The Bluetooth remote disconnects it self frequently meaning you think you‚Äôre taking photos, and it‚Äôs not. Also, when the Bluetooth remote is hooked to your phone it for whatever reason disables the ability to use your keyboard on your phone which is stupid and unnecessary so if you‚Äôre doing a photo shoot and get a text you can‚Äôt respond or browse the Internet really quick without disconnecting and reconnecting. Couldn‚Äôt design something that doesn‚Äôt do that? I guess it‚Äôs apparently too difficult. Light works well, but the annoyance with Bluetooth it‚Äôs just a pain so it‚Äôs inconvenient.",1,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"Revised review: I opened the new light that was sent to me and it was perfect. Im now giving 5 stars. The company even called to make sure I was satisfied with the new light. I will definitely be ordering from this company again.Seems to be a nice light, but a few of the orange covers that go on the light were mismatched . It looks as if they ran out of a certain brand and had to use whatever was left. I called and another one was sent to me with no hesitation. I returned the defective one. I haven't opened the new one yet.",5,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0
"I just want to start off by saying that I do an extensive search and research before I purchase any products. This light was no exception. I looked online, searched reviews on YouTube and other websites. Most companies want over a couple hundred plus for the same light or equivalent. However, after reading the reviews, looking at photos, and catching it on sale for $109. I‚Äôm completely happy. Easy set up, came with instructions, a carry bag, all accessories, it‚Äôs dimmable, attachments for camera or other recording or video set accessories, adjustable with a very tall extension, you can bend it slightly, and it works for a small or large area. I have a YouTube channel that I‚Äôll be starting shortly (Quinita Charnell) and I‚Äôm happy to make this a part of my lighting system! Buy it! You‚Äôll love it too!",5,1,2019-3-25,1,0,0
"So far this ring light has been great. It was a little more difficult to put together than I thought it would be, but it‚Äôs great once it‚Äôs together. I was disappointed about is the phone bracket does not hold my phone so I had to order another bracket which luckily, worked with the tripod. It‚Äôs not easy to take apart and store in the bag but I made do. The light is definitely VERY bright so if you are using the front facing camera for videos or selfies, the light can definitely hurt your eyes but it is a great light and stand. I would recommend it.",5,1,2020-5-10,1,0,0
This ring light is amazing for what I paid. It comes with a ton of accessories to get the job done. They only setback is my phone does not hold securely or safely in the holder.

I like the product but after a month or so I notice some things. One day one of the bulbs or something just randomly poped. It scared me! The light is still working but idk if you just can't leave it on for a hour tutorial or what but I was scared. I had to use a YouTube video to put out together because the instructions are confusing. The light is totally bright. I take good picture with it.This is my review again! It's March 14th and my light will not come on!! I don't over use my light and I wasted money!!,1,1,2020-3-8,1,1,1
"I bought this ring light over 1 year ago and this September will make it the second year, although at first I was scared it would not last this long, I was wrong!

This light ring makes it easy to take very high quality photographs of objects.  We use it for ebay listings and feel it has paid for itself many time over by allowing us to provide very high quality photographs of items for sale.

Cheap stand and parts. Wouldn't stand up wouldn't hold camera or phone. Plugs do not fit and light keeps shutting off as a result. Tried to send it back but threw out the box.Updated:,4,1,2020-8-31,1,1,1
"I bought this ring light a few weeks ago to help improve the lighting of my videos and it really came through with its quality! The set-up was very easy, even without the instructions it was pretty self explanatory on what goes where. The plastic light covers snap on and off with ease so that it‚Äôs not a huge hassle to change your lighting. If anything seems wobbly or loose, just remember to tighten up the adjustment screws and it‚Äôll be sturdy. Lastly, I like how everything can be carried in the portable storage bag. It looks very professional and the foam padding inside makes sure nothing gets too damaged.Overall, I‚Äôm pretty happy with my purchase!",5,1,2019-8-19,1,0,0
"Most everything was good but one thing that bothers me is the power chord is sensitive. If the power box part in the middle of the chord is not laying completely flat on the ground or some surface, the ring light won‚Äôt turn on. One slight bend of the chord seems to cut off the power completely (Hopefully this makes sense I suck at describing these things with electrical stuff). I had thought it came broken or defective when I tried testing it so felt the need to let people know. Otherwise, I honestly love it.

"I recently purchased the 18 inch ring light.  I was a bit disappointed when I found out that it didn‚Äôt include all pieces shown in the manual.  However the can be purchased if needed.  The assembly took about 15minutes- for easy to put together.  The ring light and stand that came with it are very sturdy, very impressed with that.  The right light included two different colored filters, one is white and the other is orange.  It also included a travel bag two ac/dc adapters, one for the U.S.  and U.K.  A Bluetooth remoter shutter button (box was damaged-not a big deal.) and an smart phone holder- I believe this will work with any smart phone.  Over all I‚Äôm very pleased, the ring light has a dimmer which goes from subtly to extreme. The ring light comes with a soft tube to add some flexibility.  When I tried bending it it was a lil difficult but worked.  The connection for the ac/dc adapters looked good no damage, however the cord to attach it to looked to be misshaped? It still works and turns to lock.  Photos attached.",4,1,2018-5-17,1,2,1
"I've had a couple months to use this light and it still gets 5 stars. I've used boxlights and such for my videos for quite a while. This light has completely changed the quality of my video. My only regret is that I didn't buy one sooner.Only one complaint and it doesn't lose a star because of it: the piece that you attach to your camera and to the light is VERY flimsy, constantly comes loose, and doesn't like to adjust easily. However, once you've got everything framed properly, it does a good job staying in place. Pretty annoying, but I love the light so much I don't really care.",5,1,2019-4-25,1,0,0

This light is really bright and I like that it has two different gels. I sometimes find myself blinking due to the brightness but it has a button that let's you adjust the dimming up or down. I also like that I can attach my iPad or iPhone to it. I would not connect a camera to it though; I would use a separate tripod.

The next day, the light would no longer dim therefore rendering itself useless for my application.

This light is a basic quality light. Easy set up but the construction sucks. All of the components have been tightened however the light is still loose to the point where it falls over REPEATEDLY if I touch it ever so slightly. I have literally been smacked in head at least 15 times since I bought it a month ago. Also, it doesn‚Äôt hold the weight of an iPad as well as I‚Äôd like. Definitely not a product I see myself using long term at all.",2,1,2019-3-8,1,0,1

"I love that it arrived on time&it was very easy to put together,but for some reason once I turned it off the wen to turn it back on it was low lighting&I had to turn it off&on a few times just for it to finally come all the way on&now it wont come on at all.Im not happy about this,I really needed this light because I do hair now I have to send it back& re-order itüôÑ.But over all it was good for the time I was able to use it",5,1,2020-7-23,1,1,1
I purchased this to shoot my passport photo. I love how the orange filter make the skin look like. I hate going to CVS and not being able to ask the person to take the photo 10 times until I like it. I placed the light in front of a white wall and use the time release option on my camera. I also use this light as an add on to my existing umbrella lights when I need to photograph things that I want to sell. This light is all around a good investment.,5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"Don‚Äôt waste your money. This ring light started out great but regrettably it has completely failed after only marginal use in the first year of ownership. The ring light suddenly died without explanation. I spent 30 minutes troubleshooting it to rule out the cause but it is just dead. I tried a different power supply, opened the back panel to look for a fuse (yep, Chinese product don‚Äôt come equipped fuses) and looked for solder failures in the ring itself. While my expectations for these types of products are very low, the sad part is consoling my daughter who is beyond disappointed with the lack of quality of this product.My recommendation... ‚ÄúStay Away!‚Äù unless you‚Äôve got money to burn.",1,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"It's not a sturdy product. I was missing an item when I received this product in the mail.  But the emails from the company seemed to be generic answers so my problem wasn't resolved. The lighting is excellent, but I can't use my tablet with the ring. I am able to use my iPhone. I guess the COVID had something to do with customer service, the reviews were good from what I had read before purchasing the item.",3,1,2020-7-27,1,1,0
"I purchased the light and it works just fine, however, the carrying case is way too small for everything to fit in it. The case doesn‚Äôt close if the tripod is put away with the light, making it super uncomfortable to carry. Then I see that they are selling a separate case that actually fits everything right like it should have with the case that it comes with. I don‚Äôt think this is fair to sell all these lights with multiple pieces and they don‚Äôt fit in the case that it comes with.",1,1,2019-12-7,1,0,0
"I literally just received this in the mail, and I‚Äôm so excited. I just finished assembling it, which was quite easy to do once I followed instructions. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase and I will do an updated review once I start using it after around a month or two, but so far I‚Äôm pleased.Update: it‚Äôs been about 2 months and it‚Äôs still going well. I use it for my YouTube and it makes my videos 10 times better. I love it",5,1,2019-5-14,1,0,1
"Can't find anything bad about this light! Perfect for my makup tutorials, selfies and pictures.  I can't believe how much it improved all my content just by turning it on.

Definitely my favorite upgrade i've got in years!",5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
Apparently a TON of these are defective. Don't order unless you enjoy the prospect of having to return this giant box and then get a replacement that may also not work. Now am wondering how many of the 5-star reviews are fake. Appears to be VERY low quality.,1,1,2020-8-21,1,1,0
"My twitch audience has grown since I started using this ringlight. I gotta say the lighting quality is so much better and has made my streams look fantastic. The set up makes me look and feel like a professional streamer. I believe my terrible lighting from before was really holding me back, but with this ring light I am drawing in more viewers that stay, thus bringing me more subscribers. If you're a streamer too you'll definitely need this lamp!",5,1,2019-3-16,1,2,0
One of the best things I could have bought for doing makeup. I love to make tutorials and this makes doing them a lot easier. I even use it to just get ready for work in the morning. It is so bright and gives me all the lighting I could need to see how it will look. I can put a mirror through it or just put it in front of my bathroom mirror and look through. I couldnt be any more pleased.,5,1,2020-5-2,1,1,0
"I was hesitant due to price so this item was on my wish list for some time. However, as my business grows I feel it's essential to have. This item is a game  changer for video and photography.

I had a specific situation concerning my purchase and Michael gave me a call directly to rectify the problem and he did it fast! This product is awesome but not as awesome as Michael I wish I could rate him 10 stars! It‚Äôs such an awesome feeling to have support from our trusted suppliers! I purchased this light to service my makeup clients and I‚Äôm such a happy artist! You have gained a forever customer with your brilliant customer service! I appreciate you Mike, my new light, and the NEEWER BRAND!",5,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0

Hands down one of the best knocks offs. Even though its led. It gives you life. I will update more later with pictures and video. But i had purchased the wrong ring light by by zomei thinking it was the neewer after lots of research and it came broken with no stand and felt cheap right away. So stay away from that brand. NEEWER IS one OF THE GREATEST. Its made stronger with great accessories.  I will be buying a second one Asap.,5,1,2018-6-8,1,1,0
This came with instructions which a lot of people said it didn‚Äôt. The quality is amazing! Everything works perfectly it‚Äôs very customizable. This is more than worth the price I bought it when I was putting together my wife‚Äôs makeup area and she loved it!,5,1,2018-10-21,1,4,1
"First, let me say that I needed this ring light since I have a FB Live broadcast and use a green screen for various background displays. I actually was using an 8"" ring light, but wasn't very pleased with the size and brightness of the light. It was my first ring light, so I really wasn't knowledge of my lighting needs. Since this was larger and much brighter than my precious light, it has taken me a little bit of time to find the best lighting for my needs, however, the various levels of lighting is great. I was able to purchase it during a Flash sale, so the price was really good also.It's a great light, but just be prepared for the fact that it is large.",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"I have been waiting for this ring light for about one month. I ordered the product one month prior so I can have professional headshots done for my graduation and work. However, the light only worked for 5 minutes. Also, I am not able to contact either their support center or amazon; I left two voicemails and emailed them regarding this matter. I will be returning this product for now.",1,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0
"This light makes it possible for more professional photos, even with an iPhone! This is great for taking photos showing make-up, hair styles, fashion and just about any other type of photos needed. It adds a dimension that increases the clarity or detail of what is being photographed. It was a gift and when the recipient opened the gift I was rewarded with the biggest smile and thanks for such a wonderful gift.",5,1,2018-1-23,1,1,0
"I really loved my new Ring Light. At first when I opened the stand, I thought it is installed upside down but then figured out No, that's the way the packaged it. You need to unfold it downward, so don't panic. I am a makeup artist so I am going to use this on my clients to get a much clear and bright pictures. I have tested this as soon as I got it to make sure everything works fine. The light is really bright on its highest setting, I would recommend to use the white filter. It would be much better and easier, if they include this instructions pictures inside the box as well.",5,1,2017-8-29,1,2,0

"This light is soo good! I got it on sale so it was even better! The light gets so bright that I have to squint when Im looking at it but you get to tune the brightness with a twist of the knob. It was so easy to assemble and the instructions came in so many different languages which is a huge plus. Overall this is great, what are you waiting for?? Buy it!!",5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"The stand itself is pretty good quality and was easy to assemble.  The orange filters make your skin look horrible, I am not sure why they did not give us blue or pink - orange is not good at all.  The light dimmer is okay.  The Cell Phone holder is a big no.  My phone falls out of it every time, no matter how many ways I try to get it to stay.  So I just lean my phone against the Cell Phone prop.",3,1,2019-7-24,1,0,0
"Well, hallelujah for some light on the subject! The light was easy to assemble, even an anxiety ridden, virtual elementary Art teacher can do it!

"Love this ring light!! Was super easy to set up! Works great!! Gave it 4 stars because in the description, it claims to have a ‚Äúgood neck‚Äù, the neck does NOT MOVE what so ever! Which I was bummed about. The phone mount is cheap, I feel like it‚Äôll break every time I try to mount my phone (iPhone 11 Pro Max). Other than those two things this is an amazing product!! Love that carrying case too!!",4,1,2020-4-20,1,1,0
"I was a bit nervous ordering this, because some people said it came broken but mine came working and package very nicely! Came in a box inside of a box inside of a bag! The light is beautiful and very bright I‚Äôve recorded many YouTube videos with it already and received many compliments! This is what your looking for! THE SEARCH IS OVER! Highly recommend !UPDATE - I‚Äôve had this for 4 months now! The lighting has no problems but my tripod is a bit shaking I‚Äôd recommend buying a more sturdy tripod but other than that awesome!",4,1,2018-8-24,1,1,0
I received this at the end of January and used it one time for a virtual event a month later. Two weeks ago I went to go use it and it wouldn't turn on.  I've taken it apart and put it back together. I've looked at the cord and the battery pack and still no resolution. I'm very disappointed as I literally used this ONE time and now it won't work Of course its outside of the return window so I cannot get a refund.,3,1,2020-4-3,1,1,0
"So far this kit has worked perfectly for making self audition tapes and makes for great lighting for some FaceTime calls. My only complaint would be is that the phone socket only holds the phone vertically and doesn't allow the option to place horizontally. I've only used the white/clear filters so far, but don't have any complaints.",5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
This light it powerful enough to light a room or a subject up close and personal. The handy dial makes it easy to dial up the soft light for portrait features on stills and video.  On portraits this light is amazing minimizing the subject of any skin flaws  and brightening the eyes making you job easier in post. Great for vlogging or video calls on those days you look tired. The ring effect brightens the face naturally with a powerful flow in the eyes. Thanks Neewer!,5,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
I previously posted the stand was missing. It was my mistake as the carrying bag it comes with does not fit the stand and they had become separated unbeknownst to me. FYI- I was emailed back quickly so that‚Äôs great. Facebook took many days so if you do have an issue email is best. Will update once I‚Äôve set it up and used it.,5,1,2020-7-17,1,0,0
The light is great. Just what I was expecting. It does brilliant lighting. BUT I thought it came with a shoe to attach a camera? Mine only had one for a phone.Maybe this light is only designed for people shooting with their phone.  Pretty disappointing I will have to use two tripods. A shame because the light itself is great.,3,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
Being locked up in my house for so long has really brought out the gamer in me.  I started streaming and wanted to make sure my setup looked professional.  This light really did the trick and makes my not so expensive webcam shine.  Can't imagine a better light source for full face lighting.  Highly recommend if you're a streamer looking to improve your camera lighting.,5,1,2020-5-25,1,1,0
I use it for taking pictures and the lighting is good but I couldn‚Äôt get it to hold my phone (iPhone max) vertically or horizontally. I had to use a phone holder from another ring light and it‚Äôs really annoying. Also I don‚Äôt like that you can‚Äôt lower it much. But it does adjust to go pretty high up.,3,1,2020-3-7,1,0,0
"I use to use the single Glamcor light for lashing & found that my before & after pictures to be too dark and didn‚Äôt really showcase my work. After purchasing this light, my clients lashes have been been shown in ways they‚Äôve never been before! I also love that I don‚Äôt have to strain my eyes anymore bc this product gives out so much light. You can also adjust how bright you want it to be. Perfect for when client‚Äôs bottom lashes are being taped down before the service.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"I absolutely love this ring light! I've used it for modeling sports gear, celebrating my friends birthday party and setup a photo booth. The Bluetooth button makes it so everyone can be involved as well as having a great background. My house has terrible natural light at the table I work at during quarantine so I use my ring light for zoom calls. The only problem I've run into is my camera bumps into the front hump but it might have been the way I screwed in the cellphone holder but it hasn't affected any of my pictures. I just angle the flexible part of the ring light instead of trying to move my phone.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,0,1
I had been using some shop lights for my streaming setup for the past year or so and finally wanted to retire them and get something more professional. This light seemed like a great choice and so far its proving to be just that.  It looks much better on my webcam and takes up a lot less room then the janky setup I had before.  The brightness adjustment lets me change it depending on the time of day and everyone in my stream immediately noticed that my video quality was better.  Great light at a very affordable price!,5,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0
Big upgrade for my YouTube videos.  Lots of room for adjustments and color with the filters.  The unit feels well made and the stand is nice and sturdy with good height adjustment.  Mount is great for my camera and the video's I've made with it are much better than I expected.  Extremely happy with this light.,5,1,2020-7-19,1,1,0
Perfect for social media & youtube videos! I can work during the night without worrying about not having enough lighting. This is perfect lighting all on its own. There are different levels of brightness which is great and it can be adjusted in height and angles. The phone fits right in the ring but I prefer to use a different camera stand to hold my phone so that I can adjust the camera to where I want it to be but its no necessary. So happy with my purchase!,5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"LOVE THIS! I wanted to get a light set up, so that I was able to film videos at night or in an area that is not right in front of a window. This light set up works super well and is very bright. I also like that you can adjust the brightness with the knob at the bottom. It is super easy to take apart and set up, I've brought this set up from one place to another a few times now. It is a little bit hot, but that makes sense because it is so bright. Definitely a good price for something like this and I would recommend it for someone that is trying to film YouTube videos or take some studio like photos.",5,1,2019-11-8,1,0,0
"This is a bright light and highly adjustable. The issue I have is that if I adjust it to be as tall as I want it to be, which isn't even as tall as it goes, it falls over because it is so top heavy. I have to weight down the legs, which is a hassle, makes it hard to move, and takes up alot of space. Poor design.",3,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
"Although there may be many harsh, 1-Star, reviews on here, what I just got in the mail was near perfect! I've trusted Neewer for a number of years now with their stands, specifically for microphones, but everything here is top notch. The, literal, only negative thing about my package was that the Bluetooth shutter remote was, very obviously, opened and used prior to my having it, but it still works, so it's not that bad, in my opinion.If you're in the market for a cheaper LED ring light, I'd say go with this one.",4,1,2019-4-5,1,0,0
This ring light was purchased to build a diy photobooth and made a huge difference when taking pictures with the iPad.

"I'm in LOVE with this product. It's larger than you'd think. Taller than you'd think. And pretty sturdy considering the price. It gets verrrrry bright. I would say to buy a diffuser. It says it comes with one, which are soft plates. But it only does so much. Other than that, the price and quality is unbelievable. Buy it. Try it. You'll fall in love.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"This set is FABULOUS!! I have already recommended it to several friends. Comes with everything you need, it all fits in its carry bag and it is very professional, nothing is weak or cheap.

Get it!",5,1,2018-1-8,1,1,0
So I really loved this at first. But I have only had it for a little over a month and the screw is not holding the light up. I‚Äôve had it fall on a client I was working on and on myself while working. This item is pricey for it to not be lasting more than two months is not okay,3,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"This light is perfect for makeup artists like myself! It‚Äôs sturdy and the lighting is great! Only downfall is that not everything fits inside the carrying case.. just the ring light it‚Äôs self but the stand does not.. which is why I took off a star.. as an MUA I have my chair, and makeup bags to carry.. I don‚Äôt have any extra hands to also carry the light + stand separately so now I gotta figure out where I‚Äôll put my stand while traveling to hotels etc.. but all in all it‚Äôs a great light! I‚Äôve tried the Zomie brand and 2 of the lights went out on me! Only after a month of having it. So I‚Äôm hoping this one lasts!",4,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"Buying this light was one of the best decisions I  have made since quarantine started! The design is so good and it is so simple to use.  I can pop my phone right in and take professional looking pictures and videos for my social media.

The light is amazing. The height can easily be adjusted and I Love the light dimmer as well. The only thing I don‚Äôt love is the phone holder. It seems really cheap and like it‚Äôs going to break every time I use it.

I use it for my beauty tutorials and it‚Äôs perfect.,4,1,2018-12-30,1,0,0
"I found a part-time job as an anchor two months ago, so I really need a professional fill light. I have heard of NEEWER before, so after comparing several Amazon photographic equipment stores, I chose Neewer. Not only because of its high sales, but also its price/performance ratio. First of all, I must say that its packaging is perfect. When I received this product,the outer box only had a little bit of corner deformation, and the ring light inside was not affected at all. Secondly, there are not many accessories inside, so It's not complicated to install them. I spent only about half an hour on assembling it. My skin looks really good and the makeup is very clear with a ring light. I have been using it for two months, during which I accidentally knocked it down once, but fortunately it did not break, I am really touched by this shopping experience. Sincerely recommend it to everyone.",5,1,2018-8-19,1,0,0
I highly recommend this light to anyone who wants better selfies or is recording. It comes with two things to choose if you want a cool light or a warm light. The highest part of the light is actually super bright and it hurts your eyes. What I do not like about this is the bigger phones do not fit so well in this. But it doesn't bug me so I won't take a star off.,5,1,2020-3-24,1,1,0
"I have an issue with the remote sometimes, it seems like you have to be the perfect distance for it to work, or maybe i'm just doing it wrong, needless to say, I didn't buy this for the shutter remote, I bought it because I needed a larger ring light for my stream. I tried a 14"" before and it was just too small, it has to be right in front of you to get the light you need and that would be in the way. This bigger one, 18"" I can setup behind my laptop and get the perfect lighting on my face. It's been doing an amazing job so I would recommend this if you have a similar setup.",5,1,2019-12-20,1,0,0
"Easy to set up, take down and travel with.  The adjustment levels are great and leave a lot of room for different light levels depending on your needs.

There's a nob to adjust the ring light horizontally/vertical, or you can use the gooseneck. The phone stand allows you to move your phone in any direction you please (right, left, portrait, landscape) without moving the light. The lighting is beautiful; one nob to turn it on, off and adjust the lighting. The remote is straight to the point, and the power cord is 11'3"".",5,1,2020-8-2,1,0,0
My son needed this for barbering so I got it for him for xmas.  Lasted ONE week then decided never to turn on again.  He wanted to give it another try b/c he really likes it for what he needs so we ordered the same thing again.  I'll let you know how that goes in a few months.  I would have chosen something else but maybe it was just a fluke.,2,1,2019-1-21,1,0,0

Really dove into my photography hobby during quarantine and wanted to get some decent lighting that I could afford.  I found this light and thought it would be a great start into lighting and I was definitely right!  Very easy to use and comes with some nice filters that can really change the mood of your pictures.  The Stand is great and holds up the light nicely.  My camera mounts right on the little ball head and can be adjusted exactly how I need it to be.

"Everyone NEEDS this ASAP! I brought it out for our family Christmas pictures, and at first the entire family thought I was being super extra... But after they saw what a difference it makes in pictures, they ALL wanted one! My selfies look photo shopped, and it really provides such great details for my makeup pictures. I even like to turn it on while applying my makeup, because the lighting is just spectacular. It's a product that I don't know how I lived without it before...  The seller is also top notch when it comes to customer service. A screw accidentally came off, and they immediately replied to my message and sent out a replacement screw. I am super happy with this purchase, and highly recommend it.",5,1,2020-1-15,1,0,0

"Won't find a better light or deal anywhere else. This works perfectly for streaming as it don't put too much light on my face, but lights me and the room up nicely. The stand is sturdy and fits right behind my desk so I have the light in front of me while I stream. The brightness can be adjusted with a dimming knob and doesn't weight very much. Storage bag is tough so the light will be protected if you travel with it. Also it has two different filters if you want to change the color of the light. I like the cool one the best. Great kit though and it has made my streams look a lot better.",5,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
This is an awesome light.  I would totally recommend this to anyone.  I don't understand the comments of the legs not being sturdy.  Not sure if they aren't tightening it enough or what.  I've had zero issues with it.  Takes awesome photos in a dark room.,5,1,2018-1-1,1,2,0

It's as bright as natural day light (if that)... the neck is supposed to bend so you can adjust it easily without having to unscrew everything, which is specifically why I bought this, It's hard as a rock theres no way you can bend it at all! It's one solid piece that actually makes the light ""top heavy"" like it's going to fall on you.. pretty scary if your using it for makeup or eyelash extensions (which is how they marketed it). Its okay for the price I guess but definitely just a cheap knockoff you would expect from amazon.",3,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"We purchased this product after seeing a similar light used at a friends party for a photo backdrop/ selfie booth setup.It's REALLY bright, but is adjustable and has light diffusers that clip on.",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"Worth every penny plus some! I started streaming and making videos a while back, but the quality just wasn't there. Now that I have this light, my videos and streams look so much better. The simple adjustments are perfect and easy to change throughout the stream as the sun goes down and my room gets darker. I had a little trouble at first getting it on the stand, but once I got that figured out, it has been sturdier than I expected. Very well-made light that every content creator should have.",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"with all the uses it has and ways to use it, it was hard to convince myself I didn't need to buy it. it's been extraordinary! seriously! I've never had an easier time shooting. Favorable lighting in white and orange with the filter on and diffused with the clear. It easily brightens or pales with the dimmer making it usable at night as well as the day. complimentary angles too on my phone since it can fit right on the ring, direct and center and rotates easily to shoot in either mode. my photos look lustrous, I'm so satisfied with this purchase!",5,1,2019-8-15,1,0,0
"The PRICE on this is UNBELIEVABLE!!! I use this all the time for my YouTube videos and it literally does everything I need. Close up beauty shots, birds eye view, close ups, you name it. You can adjust the brightness of the leds, and changing the covers is beyond easy. The bendable neck can be detached for a more stable tripod, comes with out of country charger and the bag is perfect for transport. MUST BUY",5,1,2018-2-4,1,0,0
My wife uses this and it work for live streams. It‚Äôs not very sturdy tbh but once you have it set you don‚Äôt have to touch it so it doesn‚Äôt really need to be. I though it should be more sturdy for the price even though it is as one of the cheaper versions on amazo.,4,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
I liked this ring light. Not too expensive and the size and brightness are well done. I like that I can use it for other things if I wanted. We are using it for Photography in a direct lighting setting but I can use it for set lighting if I needed to.,5,1,2019-11-7,1,0,0
I got this ring light kit because I am just starting to get into documenting my bullet journal for my blog and youtube page. This set is perfect for the price you pay. I have a Nikon camera I record for the videos and take nice pictures with but the phone stand that this comes with is also perfect for the iPhone 11 which is nice if I ever want to switch back and forth. I have not trying to take photography headshots yet and when I do for my blog I will let you know how it goes,5,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0
"This is great. Nice and bright and I like the different attachments because I mainly use a Canon to shoot but might want to use my iPhone once in a while. A little confusing to set up but once I understood it, it was quick. I‚Äôm not very happy, however, that pretty much immediately after I purchased it, the price went down by $30. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving it a three star rating. A little scummy to do that.",3,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
After using for a few hours the lowest 1/4 LED panel in the lights suddenly went to the lowest setting.  No amount of adjusting the dimmer will make it brighter.  It only flickers. Very disappointed in this light.  I also noticed t the tripod is not as sturdy as the other Neewer LED lights I have and it seems to be very top heavy.  I would not want to try to mount a DSLR on this stand and I am not sure about a cell phone if you want to adjust the Led to point down.  I have sent e-mail to the customer support but so far only have gotten an automatic reply.  I am waiting!,1,1,2020-6-2,1,0,1
I didn't know how much of an impact made on lighting until one of my friends mention that I get a light to upgrade my setup.  I can mount my webcam directly onto this light and the difference is HUGE.  My camera never goes out of focus anymore and all my videos look insanely good compared to what they were before.  If you're a newer YouTube creator like me and want a leg up in the game then invest in a ring light like this.,5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
"The ring light itself is great, unfortunately the adjustable level functions are malfunctioning. Whenever I adjust the pole it doesn‚Äôt stay, Which makes this ring light useless for me. I contacted customer service and never heard back so I can‚Äôt in good faith recommend this product, I spent a lot of money and to not have this working and I bought this in June is very disappointing. üëéüèº",2,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"So far my experience with this light has been awesome. It serves me well in my home workspace where I use it all day to light my desk as I work on the computer or take Zoom meetings. It adequately lights up my space and works to eliminate the graininess that can sometimes be problematic if there isn‚Äôt enough light during virtual meetings. The light is adjustable which allows me to move the fixture left to right front to back, etc.. A quick turn of the knob has allowed me relative ease to dim the light up and down as needed.  This light is bigger than other ring lights that I‚Äôve owned...but it fits nicely in my space and I‚Äôm totally satisfied. It also works well for the occasional selfie.",5,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0
"I record video translations so it's very important that my face, especially my mouth, is very well lit and in focus, this helps people see what I'm saying so they can learn how to move their mouths properly. Clear video (and audio) is very important, so this light works great. I tried another light before and for some reason after a few minutes of use it would start humming loudly (maybe a fan) which just didn't work. Luckily this light is quiet, BRIGHT, and helps light up my face to I can help so many people!",5,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0
"This is a decent ring light for beginners or amateurs. However, the price on this item fluctuates wildly. I bought it for 156 and then a few days later, Amazon dropped the price to 74. Make sure to not overpay!The brightness suits my needs, but if you are seeking professional results, invest a little more for a better package. And it‚Äôs unfortunate that the stand does not fit in the carrying case.",4,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
Purchased initially and that one worked for less than 5 minutes. Returned and ordered a replacement hoping it was just a one off. NOPE. Received second light 1/7. It worked 1/8 and for MAYBE an hour today (1/9/20) it now does not come on. I've let it sit thinking it overheated. NOPE. It's just dead. I use this light to photograph inventory for work so this is super inconvenient. Called and received a refund. I am not sure what to purchase now. I still need a light. UGH,1,1,2020-1-9,1,0,0
Flimsy product. Dimmer switch broke within two days. Now we have on or off. It is as bright as the sun. Don‚Äôt make the mistake of looking at it directly. I would not purchase this item again. Cheaply make and falls over easily. The carrying case does not provide any place to carry the tripod or other accessories.,2,1,2020-3-29,1,0,0
"This light meets all my expectations based on the YT vids and reviews.  This ring light is very bright at max. output but I find myself only turning it up to 25-30% when shooting vids on my Iphone 11 at 18-24"" away.  Highly recommend if your looking for an 18"" ring light.",5,1,2020-8-15,1,0,0
"Paid so much for this ring light and did not mind as I thought I was paying for top notch quality(now it's on sale. üôÉ. I've had my ring light for about 4 months now, and the first few uses were okay. Now the ring light constantly falls forward, and will only maintain hold when set straight up. If looking for a ring light with flexibility of direction, this is not the one for you. I don't think the actual piece attached to the light that is supposed to allow motion and hold it in place when satisfied can actually hold the weight of the light. Super annoying when vlogging as the ring light slowly droops down mid-video or sudden movement.",3,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
So far so good ! I received this today and my husband put it together in 10 minutes ! Light is very bright and the stand can get really high ! Which is a plus. I was able to fit my mini iPad on here (I purchased a tripod separately) ! I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase because I will be using this for a photo booth and selfies !! My pics are so bomb ! I hope it last for a while !,5,1,2019-7-31,1,1,1
"Great and straight forward kit. Couldn't be any simpler to use while giving off tons of light that can fill a room all by itself. I still like using additional lighting, but if this is all you got then it will get the job done for sure. Excellent shape that really helps even the light, so the center isn't harsh or blinding a subject. Has a choice of two colors to choose from and comes with a Bluetooth remote and storage bag for even easier operation and storage. This really is a great kit and I can't believe how cheap it was.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
This ring light has a life of 30-60 days if using regularly. My first one last 30 days and my second just over 60- now I‚Äôm 7 days outside the return window so I have to cough up the money to buy another one. (I won‚Äôt be buying this brand again.)  Brightness and quality were okay- I still had to use my phone‚Äôs editing app to brighten my photos. I use it for taking pictures of items I sell online. Extremely disappointing and frustrating.,1,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"I bought this product the end of November, and it's already broken. I have left it set up in my salon and do not travel with it. One day when I turned it on last week it wouldn't turn on at all. Now it has a short circuit and acts like a strobe light when I try and use it. Obviously I cannot cut hair like that. Yesterday when trying to use the light, it turned on but wouldn't dim. There is a number of issues with my particular light and I'm  upset. It seems my window to return it is closed, which is unfortunate. I won't buy this brand again.",1,1,2019-3-9,1,1,0
Neewer really gets it. They get the details right and provide excellent products at affordable prices. I've bought a few other things from them and every time I'm impressed. This light is BRIGHT!

"This is a perfectly bright ring light. Brightness is amazing. My issue is with the stand. It is constantly wanting to topple over, no matter which way I spin the base or turn the light.

"SO disappointed. I normally love Neewer lights & have had a few. However, this particular one fell apart immediately. The filters fall off every time I use it, they just snap off & fall so I have to reassemble the entire light every single time I want to use it (which takes a lot of time fumbling around with in front of clients). The metal was stripped after only using twice so now the light can't screw into the stand. Only had this light 2 months & it's unusable.",1,1,2019-11-1,1,1,0
"I bought this light to use for lash extensions, and it gives me the perfect amount of light, but I have to be very careful because it is top heavy and has a tendency to topple over. The light as fallen 2 times because of this, and now the bar that you adjust up and down is damaged and the light no longer stays in one place, it just swivels all around. Ive only had this product since July and it already needs to be replaced. Not sure I can justify spending this kind of money every 5 months.",1,1,2018-12-1,1,0,0
The light itself is good however the power adapter gets burning hot after about 30 to 35 minutes of use. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a faulty adapter but I am not using it for now till I try another adapter. It can be a fire hazard.,2,1,2019-7-29,1,1,0

"Im a little late on writing this review.....As a Makeup artist, I was happy to come across this bundle for my makeup kit. The ring light was a great option  because I can finally control the lighting at my clients locations. The biggest downfall was that the stand was not quite durable. It randomly collapsed during a wedding I was doing which was the first time I used it.  It was quite embarrassing. I tried to contact the 4 year insurance plan before but never received a response.",4,1,2019-1-31,1,1,0
I ordered this ring light because I needed better lighting for my youtube videos and boy did this deliver! The lighting is awesome and I'm so happy with it. It may be a tad bigger than i expected but it comes with a nice storage case and is easy to disassemble/ reassemble. My only thing is that the app it tells you to download is glitchy & tbh somewhat useless. The only thing its good for is taking pictures with the provided mini remote. But even then its weird because theres a seperate button for Android and a seperate one for iphone. I have an iphone and yet it only worked with the android button...idk. But the light itself is great.,4,1,2019-11-4,1,0,0
Highly recommend! I can record my videos on my phone so much more efficiently thanks to this easy to set up and use remote and ringlight. Being able to mount my lighting and camera together has monumentally revolutionized the way I work and shoot.

It offers an excellent dimming range and different temperature options with the filters.,5,1,2019-8-8,1,0,0
"Love this lighting for taking pictures of the cakes I bake. The bright colors and texture of the icing come out so well with this ringlight. The brightness of it really brings out the quality.

Easy to center the cakes under the light and still use my phone to shoot with it in the middle, even better and faster with the remote.",5,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0
This thing is gold for zoom. I got it to light myself up for a big zoom meeting and it did wonders. It id bigger than i expected so looks a little obnoxious from the side but the lighting in the video is so great. Used it for zoom meetings and will keep doing so.,5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0

I have nothing to compare it to since its my first ring light but it seems sturdy to me. I do use a separate tripod, meaning i haven‚Äôt tried mounting my phone or camera onto the ring but i think its fine. Dont drag it constantly around the place and you‚Äôll be fine lol.

The phone holder easily adjusts to any phone size and the light also dims and brightens very high which is perfect for areas that aren't lit well. If you into taking a lot of photos and want them to look perfect get this light!,5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
This is my favorite purchase from amazon. I went from getting 1-2 dates a month on tinder to 8-9! It is a bit large to carry around so people will likely be a little disappointed in person if they have only seen you in pictures,5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
This product is great and worth the price! It was super easy to setup and works great. The brightness takes a little getting used to if you've never been under really bright lights but other than that it's great. The orange lens makes you look tan and the white one really brightens your face. The light makes my videos and pictures look higher quality and almost professionally done! Again I highly highly recommend this you won't regret it.,5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
Worked great for a year. Then it stopped working. I have called the phone number twice and left messages and have even emailed them. I have yet to hear a response.,1,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0
"I feared the 18 inch would be too much but at this price it was hard to say no to such a good deal. I'm so glad I went with this size, it can light up a whole room with how bright it can get. The dimmer works really nicely to change the tone and intensity of the leds. Energy saving bulbs that emit low to no heat so this light can burn as long as I want and need it to since it runs on an adapter and can stay plugged in all day and night.The inner ring is large enough that I can fit my phone or camera into it thanks to the included accessories to mount them in the built in shoe mount. Turns the light stand into a working tripod, ultimate combo whether you're shooting/streaming/filming yourself or others.",5,1,2018-11-25,1,0,0
"Im still getting used to using it. When it comes, it arrives in a large box that includes everything described in the description. Note that it comes in a box, that's in a box. The main box has a handle for carrying the thing around wherever you want.",5,1,2019-9-20,1,0,0
"This item was great for a few months, except the phone adapter is very cumbersome and a few times my iPhone fell right out of the stand! Now the light itself doesn‚Äôt work reliably, it flickers or doesn‚Äôt come on at all.Customer service response was if I pay to have it shipped back they can replace. For me that is bad customer service! Return shipping should be covered or a replacement sent for the now worthless light.",1,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"This purchase was honestly the biggest disappointment. The tripod structure is completely unsteady and falls over easily (I set it up right, I checked multiple times). The ring light can't be tightly  secured to the stand either so it's super wobbly. The light also can't tilt to sides easily so it's super unpractical and difficult to use.",2,1,2020-8-14,1,1,0
"This delivered really fast!I inspected every piece that came in and since it was well cushioned nothing was broken. I really liked the quality of the item and the lighting. One thing the box was missing was the attachment mirror. It was not a big deal but, on the package it shows that it comes with it but didn't see the mirror attachment any where in the box nor the bag.",4,1,2018-3-9,1,0,0
it does a very good job for my product photography. i wish it was a little bit more powerful but overall i am very happy with the purchase. the light is good and the case that comes with it is very useful.,5,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"This light will change not only the way you light your shoots but will change the way you shoot as well. Easy assembly on the stand and placement mounting. The lighting covers all angles and defintely superior when it comes to brightness, soft boxes and umbrellas can not measure up to the intensity as well as this, but if you're looking for soft lighting, the clear cover will do the trick.",5,1,2019-5-6,1,1,0
"Next level lighting and shooting! Perfectly centered lighting, color options with the filters and it dims and brightens with gradual tuning so it adjusts slightly to get it just right, which I really like. I wish the bag could fit the stand too, that would make it a whole lot easier to travel with it but I'm happy the bag is secure enough for the ring ight. For the quality and quantity of the equipment at the price this is an amazing deal.",5,1,2019-2-22,1,1,0
The metal piece that connects the tripod to the ring light with 2 set screws is to small for the tubing so it gets wobbly once you attach the ring light. makes it impossible to mount camera straight and you have to compensate by mounting the camera crooked.,1,1,2020-7-10,1,0,0

"I just got the light, put everything together, and tested it out with a video session. I cannot speak on the longterm quality of this light, but out of the box it's phenomenal! The dimming switch is a great feature (much easier than angling large softbox lights in different directions to dim them), and it can get ridiculously bright. The amount of detail in my videos really shows with it!",5,1,2019-5-11,1,0,0
"I have returned the mountdog ringlight weeks ago. At the time I bought it for less cost but only worked for a few hours, it was very hot until it collapsed. I bought Neewer almost immediately after receiving the refund, and I believe that these positive reviews have no lies. To be honest, they look similar and the light is both good, but it's quite different from each other in workmanship, feeling like from two worlds. I wannna say that it is obvious that Neewer seems to be more elaborate, and the details of each accessory are handled perfectly. So don't waste money looking for cheaper alternatives...",5,1,2019-5-16,1,0,0
I would‚Äôve given the light 5 stars but the wire that enters the adapter is lose so i have to repeatedly push it in for it to work !! Other than that it‚Äôs The best light ever I‚Äôm in love with it ‚ù§Ô∏è Assemble was Easy and light is great quality!! It‚Äôs definitely worth 100 dollars,4,1,2020-7-19,1,1,0

"First try with a light ring. I‚Äôm happy with the tri pod  as I use it for real estate and it helps me get a great room angle! Nice bag for carrying and the remote is handy. New iPhone 11 fits super tight, takes some work to get it in the bracket. Works well.",5,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0

"Beyond excited and satisfied with this product! It's like no other ring light that I've seen before. For some reason I thought the light was going to be just one of those single bar light, but it's a bunch of tiny little lights!! The levels of brightness are amazing and so useful! For all the things it came with and the quality of all of them, I feel like it's a steal! Only other thing I wish it would've came with is a bag for the stand because it won't fit in the bag for the ring light, but Im so excited that I can't even complain. 10/10 would recommend and SUPER fool proof assembly. Didn't even bother looking at set up instructions. I can't say enough good things about it!",5,1,2018-7-24,1,0,0
"Ring Light was great while it lasted. I only used it a handful of times. The light itself seems to be good quality, the issue is the stand that comes with it, and the rest of the hardware. The knob that controls the angle just fell off, and the screw came out. The Light can no longer stand upward. The phone holder broke as well. Disappointed!",2,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"I love everything about it however, the head piece IS a bit too heavy for the body (like a lot of other reviewers stated before) but thats not a problem since I'm only 5'3 I never really extend all of it (because holy s**t its tall!!) I'd have also liked if I could charge my phone as I use it but a portable charger will fix my minor issue. Other than that I really like the light. On another note, light arrived in perfect conditions & so did the box so on that side I'm a very happy camper üëçüëçüëç",4,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0

"Great light for social media & online selling.  I like that it was easy to setup and transport to events in its bag.  It is a bit tippy when fully extended (height) but overall, quite good quality and lighting options (with dimmer) to enhance photo taking.  I use it with natural light and in very dark rooms, both produce great results.",5,1,2019-2-17,1,0,0
"I wish I would have bought this sooner. The lighting makes a difference in videos and photos. I love that you can tilt/adjust the light forward or backward, as well as bend/adjust the neck it stands on. After using the dimmer control, I fell in love!

I purchased this ring light on February 1, 2019 and today is March 28, 2019 is the day I am submitting my review to be quite honest the first time I used it it worked very well and I loved it but Unfortunately today I turned it on trying to do a video and the minute I try making the lighter brighter with the adjustment knob shock me and after that I stopped working . I hate to give a negative feedback but unfortunately the life lifespan was very short, I hope the company neewer Takes note of this and fix it because now I‚Äôm forced to buy another light from another brand üòê",1,1,2019-3-28,1,0,0
The quality of pictures I can get with this light and my phone is pretty insane.  My new phone's camera is great and this light really makes every shot look so professional.  The phone mount is great and really holds my phone securely so I'm not worried about it falling out.  The way it brings out facial features and blurs the background is so cool.  I can't believe how good my pictures are turning out and definitely recommend this light if you want to take some professional looking phone pictures.,5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"I recently started a YouTube channel to share some makeup skills, but the indoor light is poor and hard for me to make a satisfying video. My friend lent me his ring light to take a try, the effect really amazed me and made me immediately ordered my own light. The light is ultra bright (so don't stare at it and make full use of the dimming control), with the color filter it provides a soft lighting effect that makes my skin looks beautiful. I have to say using a ring light seems to be a little bit of a hassle but the difference in your photo quality would proven its worth. The stand is also quite sturdy with great level of adjustment available. I definitely would like to recommend it to more friends.",5,1,2018-9-16,1,0,0
"I am new to ring lights and was initially going to purchase the Glamcor light however, I wanted to compare first. Turns out I‚Äôm keeping the ring light- the setup was super simple-despite my strange love for assembling complex furniture pieces. The brightness is super bright but you can dim it to your comfort level. The standing pole is super sturdy as well as the ring itself. I previously purchased the cheaper option on amazon and it was too flimsy for my liking. You definitely get what you pay for and this is like having your own photo shoot!",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
Works great for streaming. Fits right by my desk and lights up my face evenly. Dimmable to wherever needed while having two diffusers that both work really well. Lightweight with a nice travel bag that makes taking it places a lot easier. Easy assembly with a durable stand that wont fall over from the weight. Maintains ots durable at full height too. Really great deal on this and it works wonders.,5,1,2019-9-15,1,0,0

"Beautiful light! First, you guys it's not upside down, you have to keep pulling the legs all the way down lol. Second the stand is at the bottom of the box.

Bit other than that great light!",4,1,2017-7-27,1,2,0
Was missing three parts. The rod didn‚Äôt let you bend it And my iPhone 11 didn‚Äôt fit vertically & that‚Äôs because I was gonna purchase a professional camera to go on top of it.. ended up returning it.The size of the light was big and bright. It was well packaged.,3,1,2019-12-31,1,0,0
"I expected it to be moderate and kind flimsy for the price, but it is solid and is capable of getting extremely bright. Perfect for filming things in slow motion. All the light you need and all very even. Very happy with this product :DI attached a vid using the slowmo on an osmo pocket. Was bearable with normal lighting. As you can see, just adding this beauty ring made it so much better.",5,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0

"I bought this mainly for my table-top studio.  In addition, I purchased two LED panel lights so the 3-light combination gives nice even lighting for the subject and the background.

"The selection of ring lights on here can be quite overwhelming but look no further than this, this brand is the answer. The ring light head is turnable with a slim and compact design, much more space efficient than bulky soft boxes. Easy to pick up and move around when I'm testing. Ideal for taking pictures with a macro lens because the soft tube insertion allows the ring to bend forward and creates a brightly well lit shot without reflections or glares. Cord length is good, no tangling my foot in it or tripping over it. The cables are covered with thick rubber with a pulling plug, so it won't rip or fray when using or unplugging. Great decision going with this one.",5,1,2018-11-4,1,0,0
"I've always wanted a ring light and I'm really happy with that one. The set up was simple and easy to put up and take down quickly. The one thing that is a little rough, if you have a bigger phone (I have an iPhone 8 Plus) it can be a little difficult to manage it in the space allotted. I wish the holder would expand on both sides and not just one. This would help with fitting in the space. The phone DOES fit! I was worried about that in particular.",5,1,2019-3-14,1,0,0
I've been making a lot of YouTube videos since quarantine started and needed a light that could light up my kitchen a bit better. This light really does the job and can also hold my phone right where I need it to be! I have a separate tripod that I can use for my other camera to get a few different angles.  This light provides PLENTY of light for my videos and is easy to move around.  Love the tripod design (doesn't take up too much space) and the wide range of dimming on the light.  Really a great setup for me!,5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
The ring light is perfect for my stream lighting.  It puts out the perfect amount of light and looks great on my stream.  I just go a new Sony A7 and it fits perfectly on here.  I can stream on 1080p and it really looks perfect.  Easy to set up and doesn't take up a ton of room. Extremely happy I finally got some good lighting.,5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
I was so nervous buying this product because there are so many versions of the ring light and you don't know what to purchase. The instructions were a little unclear but it was easy to set up. I did have to watch a youtube video because I felt I wasn't doing something right. This light can be VERY tall so it will work for a variety of situations.,4,1,2018-3-27,1,0,0
"Amazing light!!! Super easy to put together and the dimmer range is great. My only complaint is that it‚Äôs VERY top heavy. If you adjust the light forward the feet won‚Äôt stay on the ground and the whole thing tips. Over all it‚Äôs a great light, I highly recommend it :-)",4,1,2019-1-8,1,0,0
I've been using my ring light for about 2 weeks and I love it! Easy to assemble and the lighting is AWESOME. I initially  received the package with a missing accessory (the blueetooth remote). Customer service contacted me right away and took care of it. THANK YOU!,5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"The light itself is great, and the tripod is fine, but the soft tube (goose neck) that connects the two destabilizes the entire thing.  Mine will NOT stand up straight, it's as if the soft tube is the incorrect piece or as if something is missing where it screws onto the tripod.  And the light doesn't fit to attach onto the tripod WITHOUT the soft tube, so I'm out of luck.  Also, the power cord is very temperamental and will suddenly switch on and off if you so much as touch it.",2,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
I sell a lot of my thrift finds on ebay and needed a lighting that would be good enough to take pictures with so I could post and list them and this ring light has been the absolute best for it. I shoot with it too since it has a mount for my camera and phone and since it can angle down I can get more angles to show all the intricate details. The selfie remote is perfect for when I'm modeling clothes and works a lot better than the one I have for my camera.,5,1,2019-1-15,1,1,0
Easy set up and take down! The light is super bright compared to others that I've used.  It can go really tall/high which is nice for pictures of taller people. This will be the third ring light I've purchased (first purchase of this particular brand) and I can tell right away it is higher quality than the others,5,1,2019-4-2,1,0,0
I use this to stream and it is just perfect. Very light with adjustable brightness with the use of a knob located on the bottom of the light. Comes with interchangeable filters that only take a few seconds to clip on or off. Stand is sturdy and seems to hold the weight of the light pretty well. Even at full height it is just as sturdy. The travel/storage bag is nice and also made just as well as the rest of the kit. Works wonderfully and would recommend to any streamer looking into buying a light.,5,1,2019-9-22,1,0,0
"I use it to make self tapes.The only thing I didn't like was the holder for my phone. I took the holder off of a tripod I have and used that. What came with it was ridiculously, and unnecessarily hard to get the phone into. But that's a dollar item that can be replaced - I wouldn't not get it because of that. It's sturdy and easily adjustable - much more important points.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
This is the first ring light i have ever owned. I felt the set up was super easy and simple. SO simple i didn't look at the instructions during set up. I would purchase again.

"Great value and product. It was recommended by my fellow makeup artist and does not disappoint. Love the travel bag. The instructions were kind of difficult to follow so I resorted to YouTube to find a instructional video to help me put the ring light together, then I was able to assemble by watching.

I'm amazed at how bright and low it can get with the dimmer and how easy I can change the lighting from a bright to soft white or a completely golden tone with the orange filter on, gives a pretty cool mixed look when both are used in half pieces. The adapters fit with my phone or camera so you get options all around. I can safely say I'm obsessed with this light!

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because after a while the screws on the stand tends to get loose which make it tilt and I really dislike it I haven‚Äôt tried calling to discuss this concern with the company but I will Be planing on doing so because it‚Äôs unfortunate. I haven‚Äôt even had it a whole year yet. But like I said other than that it‚Äôs a great product.You can also follow my braiding page on Instagram @luttiecanbraid_,4,1,2019-4-10,1,0,0

"shipping on this item was pretty quick. it arrived secured and in perfect condition. the directions, for the most part, are pretty easy to follow and it‚Äôs very sturdy. the lights are extremely bright even the warm ones but they can be turned down or up. i would absolutely recommend this ring light hands down over any other one. it‚Äôs pretty affordable and works perfectly. 10/10.",5,1,2020-3-24,1,1,0
"This ring light is perfect for attaching a DSLR camera for filming. The mounting brackets are included. You can also mount your smartphone. It has a handy case. I've had it for 5 months now and no problems. I haven't tried the orange filter yet. It's very easy to assemble and does come with instructions in English. Most importantly, the stand is sturdy to hold everything up.",5,1,2018-10-5,1,2,0
Light did not work so had to send it back. Seemed ok but it wasn't for me so I bought a different one for less money and it was great.  Same exact thing for less money and different name,1,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
"Few weeks in and I feel like I'm a professional already. Wish I would have had a light like this back in cosmo school, because using them now it took me a little time to get used to it (just getting the right adjustments without blinding my clients) but now I think using a ring light like this is going to be the new norm, I already see them at a lot of salons/spas/lasheries I pass.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,0,0
Perfect light for my makeup tutorials.  I started a YouTube channel during quarantine and have been getting so much better at makeup.  This light really makes it so much easier for everyone to see my face and really makes my video look a lot more professional.  My webcam mounts right in the middle and makes it so easy to use.  Big improvement for my channel and I've got nothing but good feedback from it.,5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0

I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS RING LIGHT. This ring light has better lighting than the actual build it light on my ceiling. I‚Äôd have to say that this ring light on the highest power illuminates my room about 60% better than my ceiling light. I can‚Äôt wait to use this for videos.,5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0
Love this light I had gotten a smaller one but returned it due to the fact that it wasn‚Äôt bright enough. When I turned this one on it lit up the room it is definitely worth the price do not settle for the smaller one,5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
This is the prefect fill light for my streaming room.  With all the RGB lights I have in my room I needed something that would make my face stand out a little more and this was definitely the solution.  I have it sitting up behind my desk and it fills out my face perfectly.  Once I found the right dimming setting all I have to do is flip it on.  Perfect for streaming setups!,5,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
"Unlike many other ring lights, this one includes 2 color filters in white and orange for changing the light. The padded, protective carry bag securely carries the ring light in it so it's easier to take it places.This affordable ring light will be helpful for self portrait photos/videos since it's inlayed with a hot shoe mount for holding other devices, compatible with my camera by itself and the holder attaches my phone, no problem fitting it inside. The bracket and light are both rotatable and the stand has a gooseneck so angling options never run out. Flexible and fulfilling, This ring light works for it all!",5,1,2018-12-2,1,0,0
Amazed at how good my pictures have been turning out with this light.  The led's are extremely bright and really get brighter than I would ever need them to be.  The mount is good and holds my camera securely and is easily adjustable.  Carrying case is great and has nice padding and a comfortable handle.  Overall getting a whole nice kit like this for under 100 dollars is a steal and I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to get a solid piece of lighting.,5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"Been needing a new light to take selfies with, at first this seemed like it might be overkill but after using it a few times I couldn't be happier.

So cheap with the coupon too!",5,1,2019-9-27,1,0,0
The light itself is great but the stand it comes with is SO flimsy. It has a tilt function which doesn‚Äôt even work. It just falls over. If I simply look at it the wrong way the things falls over.,2,1,2019-2-8,1,1,0
"I have had this light for about a year.  I use it to go live on Facebook and IG all the time.  I love it!  It‚Äôs gives the natural light in your room, when your window doesn‚Äôt suffice.  It‚Äôs super easy to use, and you can use the different snap on covers to do different lights.  I also love that it‚Äôs easy to put together and take apart if I need to move it or take it somewhere.  I have also used it for before and after pictures for fitness and my clients for makeup!  I definitely recommend this product.",5,1,2019-8-26,1,0,0

"This is the perfect portrait light. I can mount my phone right in the center and control it with the bluetooth remote provided with the light. The bag does not fit the stand, but the stand can be folded small enough to not take up much space and it is all pretty light. I love that it dims and the orange filter really brings out my skin tones. It definitely makes taking selfies a lot more fun.",5,1,2020-2-29,1,0,0
Amazing starter kit for lighting and self shooting simultaneously. The phone holder and remote are compatible with all makes and sizes of smartphones so you can use it with droids and iphones. The remote lasts a long time! It takes watch batteries and turns off and on with the slide of a little button. I forget to turn it off all the time and the battery doesn't run down. The hot shoe adapter is also dslr compatible so I can use it with my camera too and it holds the weight securely and steadily. Long cord and light weight stand for portability around the room. Love this lighting with the white and orange filter set!,5,1,2018-11-6,1,0,0

"I am a special effects artist and this light really helps to get colors and fine details right when doing makeup for a show/movie. The size and weight make it really easy to take with me from location to location and it can be set up so quick. The dimmer and filters both make it easy to get the lighting perfect, sometimes even pretty close to how it will look on set versus the dressing room lights. It barely cost me anything and has improved my work quality ten fold.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,0
"Newerr is alright but I really wish I wasn‚Äôt so concerned about saving money 6 months ago and had gone with the Diva Ring.

AMAZINGGGG product. at first I was super iffy to buy this ring light because It was so cheap so of course I went on YouTube and looked for people reviewing this specific ring light and to my surprise? They LOVED It. Came super quick and simple to assemble just follow the instructions given. The packaging was great everything was safely covered. It came with everything listed including the phone adapter thing and the light is dimmable which is literally heaven sent. 10/10 would definitely recommend,5,1,2020-4-1,1,0,0
"I was extremely excited to get this, and when we set it up it did not work.  I called amazon tech support and their suggestion was to send it back for a refund.  I emailed someone from the actual company, and they sent me a new power cord.  The light works now!  The person I was emailing from the company was extremely helpful!  So I suggest if you have a problem with the light, email the email address that comes on the little card you receive with the ring light.",3,1,2020-3-10,1,0,0
"The lighting is great except I‚Äôve used it 3 times and the bolts and knobs are falling off around my house ans i cant even find them aww.  Terrible durability in reguards to connections.

"This can't be beat for the price! I have the LED version and have been using this for the past year with no issues. It's so bright, easily portable and the stand is completely adjustable.

It‚Äôs not portable, you can reassemble and dissemble with no issues. It‚Äôs prefect!! I love it ! I wish I could have like 50 more of them just for the heck of it !

"I ordered this item for my shop and unfortunately, I went through the entire set up process for the light to completely not turn on. The next day it turned on but VERY VERY DIM. Not a ""ring light"" or ""LED light"" at all. My flashlight on my phone could do much better than this. It is very disappointing as there were a few other better options I could have gone with. I do not recommend this brand, very bad quality.",1,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0

"I really wanted this product to work, so much so that I tried everything from changing the flooring of where I used it in hopes of his stopping its unsteadiness. The top part with the lighting will not at all stand upright and continues to lean and wobble around all the time, as a result when I opened the locks to increase the height then locked them back in place, it fell over, luckily it fell on my sofa. That plus the the metal legs being very unstable and loose renders this purchase useless. I can no longer return this as I spent too much time trying to get it to work.",1,1,2019-6-7,1,0,0

Needed something to help with the lighitng for my streaming setup. This light was exactly what I needed and really makes my stream look so much better.  The lighting is perfect and I can adjust it depening on the amount of natural light I have in the room.  The stand is perfect and I found a way to mount my webcam in the middle to make it just right.  If you're looking to upgrade your streaming setup I highly recommend this light .,5,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"A good ring light, I plan to take an out of the box video, so I briefly summarized some of the advantages:- Fast delivery and good packaging",5,1,2019-3-7,1,1,0
"This product was a great investment in my opinion. I‚Äôve read reviews about how it didn‚Äôt cone with directions which it did. I‚Äôve also read another review about it being wobbly after setting it up and I‚Äôve began to think it was just the way it was set up, not too sure. For myself the ring light is great and it comes with both directions and a button you can use to take photos. The lighting setting is great especially if this is your first time using a ring light. Lastly your photo quality is so much better with the ring light.",5,1,2019-3-5,1,0,0
"The ring light is plenty bright. the dimming controls are set at small intervals so it seems easy to get the right light for your desired look. The construction and build is good. While I haven't had it long enough to confirm durability, the build and the protection afforded by the case should produce a long life. It seems like a lot of flexible and adjustable light for the money.",5,1,2018-6-24,1,0,0
"this is not a bad ring light at all. Could use a bit better material for the stand, but overall decent. My only issue is that in order to keep the light on a stand, you simply place the light on top and 'screw' something on the side so the screw just wedges onto the pole you placed it on. Not the most secure (or practical) of fastenings, but it does the job i suppose. Also, the stand that holds your phone won't allow your phone to be held upright, which is super annoying. But not a deal breaker!",4,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"This ring light acts as the perfect vanity mirror. The lighting is bright and allows you to see every nook and cranny in your face so no spot will go untouched, unseen, or unblended. Highlights make up so well, shows off pigmentation and enriches colors to true tone in image and video. I can set it behind my mirror or use it on the stand it came with and both work well for me. The stand height can alter with the twist of a knob to unlock to lower or heighten. The phone holder makes it quick and easy to take selfies of the outcomes and gives beautiful lighting bright led lighting.",5,1,2018-11-22,1,0,0
"I wish I can leave 0 stars! I‚Äôm Completely disappointed with this light I only got to use it 5 times and it wouldn‚Äôt turn on anymore!!  I paid all that money just to be able to use it 5 times!! I read other reviews saying the same thing and I still took my chances not thinking it would happened to me cuz I really needed a ring light for my professional pictures, but now I‚Äôm in the same boat!!! Next time I‚Äôm definitely taking into account when other costumers leave bad experiences!!",1,1,2019-6-29,1,0,0
First time using a light like this and they are as nice as advertised. Stand is a nice metal one and sturdy. The light is also well made and easy to use. Adjusting brightness just takes a turn of the dial. Color filters snap on and come off just as easy. There is nothing hard about this light and I really appreciate that.,5,1,2019-5-5,1,1,0
"I am a painter for new construction jobs. I used to use halogen lights to see befoer the ceilings were installed, but they get really hot. After a few burned dropcloths, i figured it was time for a new light. I have purchased a few of these now, so I felt like it was time to rant about it. The lighting that this ringlight gives off is clean and really helps me find any imperfections in the freshly painted walls I am working on. It is also very sturdy so i dont have to worry about knocking it down when I am walking by. Really superb quality all the way. Satisfied!",5,1,2019-1-26,1,0,0
I love the light! I love how bright it is and how big it is. BUT my only issue was the tripod not standing even &the phone holder SUCKS! It has little to not motion & I can‚Äôt even sit my phone vertically without it popping off. Ugh.,3,1,2020-6-15,1,1,0
"This kit is really good for lighting makeup and cosmetics. The filters help get the right color tone while the light is able to dim to the proper brightness. Really lightweight for its size too, making it great to carry with you. It fits nicely into the storage bag and it is easy to assemble and  tear down. Makes all my pictures look a lot better and professional while not breaking the bank.",5,1,2019-9-14,1,0,0
"It is completely unreliable. I ordered one in March and when I plugged it in, it would not turn on.  I ordered a second and it worked for 30 days of very infrequent use and broke again. When I turned it on today, the same thing happened. This product has remained on its stand, untouched in a backroom for the duration of the month that I've had it and it somehow couldn't handle being used twice a week over four weeks.  This is so frustrating.",1,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
I was a little skeptical due to reading a mixed amount of reviews about the durability of the phone holder and the light in general. But I love the brightness and how you can dim it really easily. And I Haven't had a problem with cell phone holder because I tightened it by playing around with the actual piece that holds it and learned to tighten it. I am super stoked to start using it for my youtube videos and I plan to buy the extra pieces this company sells for this set such as the mirror attachments.,5,1,2019-2-17,1,1,1
"This ring light is great, I am serious. I have been paying attention to the ring lights on the market and summed up several worth buying. The size of the seller is also within my consideration, now this is the best choice! It differs from the cheapest (basically identical) ring light on the market by $20, but here I see better materials and intimate after-sales service. You can not only get the stand, the bag and the phone clip, you also have a Bluetooth remote control that controls the shutter of the phone. I definitely recommend this set of ring lights anyway!",5,1,2019-1-24,1,0,0
"I was on the hunt for a while before I found this gem. I am a lash tech and can say that this is the perfect light when lashing. Great brightness, dimming option and very adjustable. Also works well for traveling artists. Recommend to all lash techs.",5,1,2019-1-12,1,1,0

"Bought this for my wife. She lives it! I love it. She uses it for vlogs, pics, and to see tiny peices while working. We've had it for months now. From 1-10 the sturdiness is a 7. I wish I was just a little more solid, but it's cool. Not flemsy",5,1,2020-5-8,1,0,0
My husband is a barber and he loves this darn thing!! It's very light weight and easy to use and it comes with a cool travel case. I love the way you can control the lighting by smoothly turning the dials vs the ones that click.  It gives you more control.,5,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0

I would not recommend this light due to it not being sturdy. It bends on the lower shaft and wobbles a lot. Weight of light is way too heavy for the stand.,2,1,2020-7-23,1,0,1

I gave this a 3 because so far I haven‚Äôt had any issues with the light or stand. My issue is with this joke of a carrying case. Am I the only one that can‚Äôt fit everything into this bag? It was clearly made for only the light which is extremely annoying. I can‚Äôt even fit the cords in when they‚Äôre wrapped properly.,3,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0

Wayne‚Äôs wife here! This ring light has been a complete game changer in my career as an mua! Lighting jus just sooooo important! I use it with every client! It‚Äôs easy to take a apart and put together and the bag makes it more convenient! I bought it at $135 then checked back later and it was $119 so that was annoying but it was still worth every penny!

"Although I bought the ring light for the first time, this is the fact: It is the BEST ring light! The packaging was pretty good and everything was in good shape. Easy to install, saves time and effort, no need for a second person to help. The tripod is much better than I expected, but I need to read the description on the page. If you want, it can become especially bright (hard to open your eyes, this is definitely a great tool for long-distance shooting). Of course, it can be adjusted through a small knob/dimmer. In short, everything is fine, very suitable for a variety of indoor shooting work.",5,1,2018-9-20,1,0,0
"After CAREFUL screening, this is the right one I want. Very well packaged and everything was in good shapes. Although there are hints in the ad, the position of the tripod should also be marked conspicuously on the package. I have already returned the ring light of another brand I bought with this one together, because in all the details, I think Neewer is slightly better. First the price, about $20 cheaper; and the customer service is like always online; the quality seems better as well, more sturdy and bright. I like the long cables and the bag with a certain shape. Absolutely recommended.",5,1,2018-9-28,1,0,0
Great product. Works well at creating realistic lighting for my wife's at home audition recordings.Not the most solidly built. Haven't tried out the remote but it looks a little cheap. Might work great though just haven't needed it.,4,1,2018-11-7,1,0,0
These are nice and good quality. I've had them a year now and found I need to use it high up for overhead recording but it tips over bc its top heavy.I also like using it as a mood light for my studio or bedroom.Overall good buy and if you need an overhead set up I'd suggest getting a separate stand.,4,1,2020-5-28,1,0,0
Easy and super effective for my portrait shots.  I like taking selfie pictures a bit too much and heard that these lights were the way to go.

Definitely has improved my pictures tenfold and I reccomend anyone who likes taking portrait pictures to pick one up.,5,1,2020-4-4,1,0,0

I use the light for photos and for doing makeup and hair, etc. I love that you can adjust the angle of the light to use overhead or directly in front of you. The stand gets incredibly tall as well. Was worried about that since I am a bit taller. But it gets much taller than I‚Äôll ever need. I am disappointed that it doesn‚Äôt include a mirror and that the mirror isn‚Äôt purchasable anywhere. I‚Äôm also a bit disappointed that the phone mount doesn‚Äôt rotate.",5,1,2019-7-23,1,0,1

"Fits behind my desk in just the right spot for me to use while I stream. Lights evenly and has a dimming knob so I don't blind myself. Once out of the box it just needs put on the stand and plugged in then it is ready to go, pretty simple. I don't use the button very much but for some that could be useful. The bag though is great and keeps the light in good condition while not in use. Wish I had bought this sooner, but glad I have it now.",5,1,2019-10-4,1,0,0
This light is so amazing and has really helped me take awesome pictures!  Its perfect for taking pictures of my face and really brings out all the good qualities of my skin.

Really well equipped light with a nice stand and mount that works great with my phone and T6.  Has some nice diffusers that really do a good job and the warm orange one looks awesome in the pictures I've used it for.

Definitely a great buy and I am excited to continue using it.,5,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
Loved how bright and big it was lighting up the whole space however mine had a loose wire that made it flicker and sometimes not turn on at all. It is very large so is bulky in a small space.

This was the most valuable investment I have in recent times, because it looks very durable and has a huge advantage in that it did not turn hot. I believe it has a long life and I think I will keep updating review, thanks a lot.",5,1,2018-11-23,1,1,0
"Went with the model with the soft tube neck and I made the right choice! I'm completely marveled at how steady it holds the light up, even with it bent facing down! I'm most happy to be able to set my phone in the mount holder and use it ON the light. Saves me from having to hold it and keeps my frame steady and in focus!",5,1,2019-7-14,1,0,0
"Love it, my daughter and I share it. She is a licensed esthetician, make up artist and lash tech and she uses it for her clients and for going live on social media platforms. It serves the purpose also for our pictures.",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0
I love this light! I been looking for one for a while. everywhere I looked they were always more expensive so I figured I‚Äôd give this one a try! It‚Äôs very functional and easy to assemble!

Wanted to get some nice lights for my streaming setup.  After looking at a lot of other peoples setups the ring light seemed like the way to go.  This one is great and has all the features I need.  Gets extremely bright and really lights my face up perfectly.  If you want some quality stream lighting this is definitely the light for you.,5,1,2020-8-18,1,0,0
"Probably the best light for doing any kind of streaming or video calls. I put my camera in the center of it and it makes my videos look really nice and professional. The bluetooth remote has got to be my favorite little piece, its perfect for group photos or insta photos. The stand is nice too and I can set it up on my own. I absolutely love this light kit.",5,1,2020-6-19,1,0,0
"This ring light is built for self timed photos and videos. My phone fits in the case mounting and I can turn it any I want to shoot in. My canon can fit in the bracket alone into the screw thread. The filters give great choice in tone too. I like to use the orange to make me look less pale but the clear is amazing for softness. The dimmer works well to control the brightness, and gets relatively low as well as strobing. I get outstanding lighting that is centered every time, even when pointed down up. This set up is smart and ideal for any solo content creator.",5,1,2018-11-25,1,0,0
So far so good. Ive only used it once since I got it but I love it. I give it a 4 star because I have to really use it for a photoshoot first. It came with everything. Just make sure to check all the way at the bottom. The stand comes in the bottom so make sure not to throw the box away.,4,1,2017-10-19,1,1,0
I love this ring light. I am so glad that I went with this model rather than one of the cheaper ones. It makes you look stunning every time. It is great for pictures and videos alike.,5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
The part where it holds your phone is kind of flimsy but other than that it was perfectly. Light is bright and ring is big enough for what I need it for. Uses it for lash clients and to use it sometimes to shoot videos,5,1,2018-12-16,1,0,0
"Best light in my opinion, mostly because I can put my phone or camera inside of it, so I have perfect lighting on every side of the shot. This thing is insanely powerful and never overheats so it can be turned on for hours. Comes with all the accessories I could need and is a solid piece of gear. Came at a good price too!",5,1,2020-8-9,1,0,0
The stand is so weird I‚Äôll try and pick it up and it literally comes out of the sockets it‚Äôs supposed to stay in. It also doesn‚Äôt come up vertically all the way which is weird. It‚Äôs very top heavy so it falls over depending on how I bed the ring light down. It‚Äôs not the best and pretty annoying to deal with.,2,1,2018-11-4,1,0,0
Profound lighting. Dual options with the filters to create ultra soft to ultra warm lighting. It's a trailblazer! With this and the device mounts it beats everything in the convenience and performance of both a tripod and lighting while combining them together in one support system. Ultramodern.,5,1,2019-8-11,1,0,0
So easy to use this light!  I had it set up so fast and was taking selfies in the first 15 minutes.  The effect it has on my skin and face is amazing.  Really brings out all my good features and gets rid of any shadows that I had to deal with before.  The effect it has on my eyes looks so good too.  SO happy I was finally able to get one!,5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0
"With my purchase of the neewer ring light, the following accessories are missing: smartphone and tablet holder, mirror, screw driver/ screws! Not cool. This is obviously a used item.

"If you do any kind of streaming or video uploads, this is a must have light. My videos are looking so much better. It was cheaper than getting a real camera and even then, I would have probably still needed a light of some kind. This lets me record with my phone and still get good quality. I have now used it for a few weeks and can't find anything I don't like about it.",5,1,2018-12-4,1,1,0

So surprised how well this light works.  I had heard good things about these ring lights but didn't fully understand how good they were until I got one.  The way the ring lights up your face makes the light spread out perfectly and make your skin glow. Overall it feels like its made with good quality components and I haven't found any problems.

This is a great product thus far and my girlfriend seems to love it! Easy to set up and use. It can get very bright and light up the whole room. Immaculate for pictures 10/10. Just wish the tripod was a little sturdier but it works fine.,5,1,2020-6-7,1,0,0
"Limitless possibility and function with this ring light. Attaches right onto the tripod stand quickly by just screwing it on. Really easy to use. Can adjust the color temperature with the dimmer and change up the effect with the clear and orange filters for different lighting. Bright or dim, the lighting evenly spreads across the space and gives a clean shot.¬†Received both US and EU plug. The foreign plug has been so useful, such a comfort knowing I could bring my ring light with me abroad in style. Everything is perfect!",5,1,2018-11-25,1,0,0

Got my light set up for when I stream and it's the final part I needed to completely upgrade my twitch. Love how simple it is to turn on and adjust when I need it.

Works really well for shooting all my youtube videos with.I went throught and shot 4 in one day and it did not once flicker or beat out on me. Stayed on and bright for hours and didn't get hot. I tried different angles and changed the height several times with my fujifilm loaded on and not once did I feel like it was in harm's way. It stayed propped in the light through all of it!

It isn't stable, will fall over, the screws holding the light onto the tripod stripped all the holes out and now I just rig one screw to hold it on (very unstable) while I take pictures.

"I really like this ring light very much, but I still want to honestly tell everyone my regret. The ring light itself is completely problem-free, it is bright enough to be dimmed and easy to operate, but the light stand always shakes a bit. It seems that it will fall in the next second, the gooseneck part needs a lot of strength to bend, but its hardness can keep the light head fixed. I still have to give it five stars anyway.",5,1,2019-1-17,1,0,0
I had high hopes for this light but it‚Äôs not quite what I was expecting. It‚Äôs wobbly and even though I take pictures during day time I have to adjust my pictures after using this ring light.

"Bought this to start my youtube videos with and I can tell it was the best decision made! Love that i can switch out the filters for a warm or soft look and change the mood of my lighting, or leave off for bright spotlighting. The leds are my favorite because I don't need to worry about bulb replacement, LEDs last forever and are more efficient and cost effective in the long run.

Just a tip from me.",5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"I'm totally satisfied with the product and the service. Pretty solid construction, I've knocked the light over for several times and it still works strongly.

Let me start off by saying that this ring light was super easy to set up. The stand for the ring light is very sturdy & easy to adjust.

When I tell you I love love this light. Set up was seamless which camewith instructions and a light carrying case. The carrying case is secure enough where the light is protected. There is not a case for the Tripp‚Äôs but that‚Äôs ok. The tripod seems not as sturdy for the light. I currently use the light for my Boutique. The first pic is when I first purchased it. Oh you can angle the light and your phone. The description does not give a good capture of this product. I was very surprised it comes with a remote. Like whoa!!!  VERY GOOD INVESTMENT!,5,1,2018-5-2,1,0,1
"Delivering super fast! I always wanted to buy a ring light, but now I can only buy this traditional patch-style ring light because of my low budget. Reasonable price and guaranteed quality make me even more pleasant. If I must find out what is not enough, there is only the swing of the light holder. The folded stand is housed in a small carton box that is portable but I hope it will be a bit thicker. this is all!",5,1,2019-1-22,1,0,0
Bought this ring light to replace my previous old version lamp of another brand whose built-in rechargeable battery has expired after nearly three years. I am delighted with this new light which is of a higher build quality than my old one and which is equipped with color filters as well as a tiny remote control. I have got lots of great shootings with it so far. Looking forward to a long lasting use with it.,5,1,2019-2-4,1,0,0
"The ring light works great, I‚Äôm very satisfied.I have read a lot of negative reviews saying the light won‚Äôt turn on after a long break, but it‚Äôs not the case for me, using it for a while already and it works perfect.",5,1,2020-3-15,1,0,1
Putting the stand and ring light together was a PAIN. As most of the reviews said the ring light is too heavy for the stand and it does not stay up. Very disappointed in that. But once you lean it up against something it is very bright and so far it works. If i would‚Äôve read more reviews I would not have purchased.,3,1,2020-5-15,1,0,1
amazing lighting at all angles with this ringlight! very portable since it comes with a bag and makes it easier and safer to put it away. the stand is very sturdy and has a good amount of height it can adjust to and folds up easy for transporting.

"Amazing quality exceeded expectation, I was deeply touched! First of all, we have to admit that its price is much reasonable, the pursuit of low prices is not the sole purpose of buying electronic or light products.

Ever since I pulled my Ring Light out of the box it was broken. It was not sturdy so every time I went to film something it would fall over or the video would be lopsided.

After browsing all the unique flares of different models I realized this ringlight suited all my wants. It's on a ball head bracket so I can rotate the angle as well mount the whole light down with the bendy neck on the stand. Since I do a lot of shooting where my camera is mostly pointing down this makes it just that much easier for me. I really like the flexibilty and support as well as the brightness.,5,1,2019-1-21,1,0,0

Perfect lighting...",5,1,2019-2-2,1,0,0
So I‚Äôm finally getting around to using this light. My previous light finally went out. I go to put this light on the stand and it won‚Äôt stay because the plastic is warped so I can‚Äôt even screw it onto the stand. I‚Äôm sure the light works well but I can‚Äôt use it because the actual light won‚Äôt stay on the stand.  So now it‚Äôs just in the corner until I figure out what I want to do with it,3,1,2018-12-11,1,0,0

I've read reviews on this item of the ring light suddenly not working after a few of months of use. I bought this ring light and loved it until it stopped working less than 1 day of use. That's right! It worked less than 1 day and stopped working after that. Not happy!,1,1,2018-3-3,1,1,0

"I am having fun using this kit.  It takes a little assembly to get right and the plastic clip ons are a bit difficult to put on - meaning it takes 3 minutes.

"The light is great, no complaints. The stand I think is defective. There is no way to lock it so it stays the same height I adjust it. The screws do not tighten fully. I've been using this light and stand for months now and I'm finally getting frustrated enough with the stand not being stable that I'm going to have to purchase a new stand. Just not from this brand of course!",2,1,2017-5-30,1,1,0
I just received this ring light on Sat 4/14/18 and of course like  most others I was very excited to receive. Today is Mon 4/16/18 and the light is acting weird. It does not come on when you turn the switch on and if it does come on it comes on bright and cannot be dimmed or it is flickering. Such a shame because I was so looking forward to using this ring light. Sadly I work to hard for my money to waste it so I will be returning to Amazon ASAP.,1,1,2018-4-16,1,1,0
I love this light ring. It works well for my business. It comes in a very nice padded carrying case and with a stand. I wish it came with instructions on how to set it up though. I had to find videos on YouTube to assemble it. Good quality and easy to use.,5,1,2017-5-18,1,0,0

"I bought this back in November and it hasn‚Äôt even been a year when the LED lights began to die out. Unfortunately, I can no longer return it and there‚Äôs no warranty, despite the expensive price.

"I received this as a gift and love it. It‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for. I read reviews about no directions which is unfortunate. Mine did come with instructions but it was also fairly self explanatory. I read another review about the tripod being upside down.... it‚Äôs not, you just have to keep extending it and it will flip. Took a little extra strength but I got the job done. The brightness adjustments is perfect for what I‚Äôd need it for. I have nothing to really compare it to so I think it‚Äôs great. Also there‚Äôs an attachment in which you can connect your phone. I have an iPhone 8plus and works like a charm and the remote shutter key is amazing and works through bluetooth. My canon t3i also attaches perfectly. Sucks if you can‚Äôt find the instruction kit but I‚Äôve attached a picture of mine.",5,0,2017-12-25,1,5,1
"I really like this ring light, a lot.  I got it to use while working on nails, and it‚Äôs perfect.  I have a bright, shadowless work area and I can see all the small details much better now.  It sits on my left, slightly behind my shoulder, and it does not generate a bunch of heat, hallelujah!  I love that I can bend the top (18 inches? Ish...) of the stand and angle the light where I want it.  When products say they come with a free carrying case, I expect a flimsy nylon useless pouch.  The carrying case for this is an actually sturdy, shaped, firm cloth case!  To my surprise, its really good quality.  The phone mount works very well, and keeps the phone secure even when it‚Äôs at a downward angle.I haven‚Äôt used any mode other than bright white, and I haven‚Äôt used any of the filters that come with it.  But based off the quality of the light and the case, I suspect they are also quite good.",5,0,2020-4-12,1,0,0

"The Pros to this item. The lighting is great, I received all pieces. Thank goodness! I am extremely satisfied as the light is normally $119 however I did have a coupon and only paid $69 I feel extremely blessed for that. This item was delivered to me on a Sunday and I ordered it on Saturday only ONE DAY DELIVERY.The con to this item: One or the fighting bolts on the side that adjusts the height cane off literally broke off. Smh my husband had to use E6000 to get it back on. Other than that I look forward to making my YouTube videos, my pics and anything else also my makeup lol.",4,0,2020-8-23,1,1,0
"I love how bright it can get to get nice lighting for video conferences.  However, it can get too bright where your eyes can't take it, would be nice to have a fliter than diffuses it more than the two kinds it comes with so it's more gentle on the eyes.  Another negative: The tripod that it comes with, doesn't even fit in the bag that it comes with? So if you need to take it to another office/place, it's kind of awkward to carry the tripod separate from the ring light.  The tripod allows you to raise and lower the light, with a good range, however the bendy neck that it came with seems too flimsy, it doesn't secure well when trying to attach it to the tripod, it's kind of loose so even though you tightly turn the knob right, it is wobbling a bit, but if you leave it alone, it'll stay put.",4,0,2020-7-24,1,0,0

I have had it since 12/2019-08/2020 and it works like a charm. Doesn‚Äôt over heat or get hot and my selfie remote still works and connects to the Bluetooth on my phone just fine. No complaints, no regrets! I will say idk how to fit everything in the blk bag it came with. The ring light fits but the tripod I always awkwardly stuff it in the bag and it sticks out...but I hardly ever travel with it so it‚Äôs no big deal to me. I ended up getting this when it was on sale for I paid $60 something for it.",5,0,2020-8-11,1,0,1
"I purchased this ring light as a birthday gift last July for the sake of starting my YouTube channel and for my LIVE social media videos. It first started off really great! The right light itself is great but the ring light started tilting on the stand making it appear lopsided when doing videos and I have to fanagle it with a towel or something to hold it up straight. Needless to say, I stopped using it for production because I was tired of apologizing to my audience for the lopsided-ness of my videos. So my anticipated use of it has been disappointing to say the least. The right ‚Äúlight‚Äù itself is great for use but it serves no purpose if it‚Äôs not sitting up straight and I‚Äôve even had it to tilt completely over while in the middle of taping. The right light casing is perfect for travel along with the box for the stand as I put it away after each use. But there‚Äôs a disconnect with the stand that‚Äôs driving me insane. And I‚Äôm hoping that the seller it manufacturer can do something about this. I do NOT wish to purchase another stand for something that became useless after a couple of months. So imagine how long it‚Äôs been stored away.",2,0,2019-3-30,1,0,1
"I ordered the ring light Monday. Received it Wednesday. Set it up, plugged it in. It came on, then it went out. Very upset. Received a faulty light. Wasted $95 bucks. Really needed this for a big project And this has set me back. If you can find another brand, go for that one. It‚Äôs not even as sturdy as I thought it would be. To Best Buy I go!",1,0,2020-8-5,1,1,0
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the light itself is amazing!! BUTTTTT the right light BROKE!!! I have to use other objects for it to stay flat on the ground because the screwers on the actual stand will not stay!! It‚Äôs the most worst thing ever because unless someone holds the light while photos are in session, it will fall down!! I wouldn‚Äôt purchase another one from this company due to the low quality screwers. That‚Äôs pretty much what keeps everything together.",2,0,2020-9-26,1,0,0

I almost want a second one for myself for selfies! It makes them look 100% better! Definitely worth it! And it comes with a nice carrying bag, the only downside is the remote doesnt work with newer phones, but I just use my delayed timer button and it‚Äôs no biggie. Five stars!",5,0,2019-12-19,1,0,0
It works exactly as I was hoping. It seems a little weak in some areas and I would mount my dslr on it but I stuck my tripod right behind it and it worked perfectly.

"I shopped around a bit, but I knew I'd come back to this one. If you're serious about your Youtubing platform or filming videos with higher quality then you should make the investment. I couldn't be happier. It's a beautiful light and it gets the job done. If you receive your light and cannot locate the small controller (dimmer), look in between your orange color filters.

"I am thinking about purchasing this tripod because it came with all the accessories you needed to get started making videos.

"This thing is incredibly bright, and comes with a million addons and gadgets. It has a button to take pictures, a bunch of mounts, various colors of lenses.

Still sturdy though and gives plenty of support to the light. The kit is also affordable for anyone, so it is a good buy if you are just starting to stream.",5,0,2020-8-15,1,0,0
I‚Äôm extremely disappointed! I loved this light and then one day out of no where it stopped working. I had only had it for 1 month. I actually contacted Neewer and spoke with a rep and she asked to to send her a ridiculous amount of information on the item which included a video showing her the exact issue (Please trust the word of your customers companies. It‚Äôs terrible customer service to make someone submit a video. Just stand by your product). Anyway I complied and sent everything in an email ( AS REQUESTED) and no response. It‚Äôs been months now. I will NEVER purchase from Neewer again and I‚Äôve recommended many of my students to purchase their lights in the past.

"This product construction is very flimsy so I can see why it has failed and will fail others in the in short term.

"This light was easy to assemble and was wonderful....for a few months. I purchased in November and didn't really start using it until late January 1-2 times per week for no more than 30 minutes. In March, I began using it more for extra light while virtual teaching but again, no more than 1-2 hours for 2-3 times per week. Last week (the end of April), the light completely stopped working. I went to turn it on and nothing. I tried every outlet in the house and to no avail, it just stopped working.

First thing first. There is no con to this ring light. It‚Äôs lightweight. So I can move it with ease. I love it sitting up in my corner. And bring it out when I need it. I absolutely love this. If I ever need another one I‚Äôm buying this one again. The package was nice. It came with a black bag for the other accessories. Just a great buy. This ring light is bright as hell. And a great price. It‚Äôs straight forward on set up. You can bend and turn it anyway you want. You can change the height from the shortest possible to the highest. I love it.

"I liked that it was adjustable (tripod, and light ring  and light brightness), easy to set up. However, within a month the tripod began to lean to one side. Thought it was a loose screw but on closer examination the lower plastic connector holding the tripod legs was cracked in 2 places. This equipment has never been roughly handled  or had heavy use. In the process of contacting the manufacturer now, as it is just past the 30 day return to Amazon time frame, of course. Very unhappy about that.  NEEWER please respond regarding a replacement part!UPDATE 12/23/2019: Neewer did respond within a couple of days to my complaint and with a few more photos describing my problem with the tripod emailed to them, they mailed me the lower tripod part very quickly. I attached it and all is well. Thanks Neewer for your quick response, great communication and customer service.  Happy customer!!",3,0,2019-12-1,1,0,1
I'm annoyed with this product right now.  Basically I bought this about 2 years ago.  It worked pretty well for a while.  I am an actress and I use it for self tape auditions.  I would say I used it about 3 times a month - max.  So it has not been used a ton.  But it is already falling apart.  The bottom of the tripod won't stay up anymore.  The rubber pieces on the bottom are falling out.  It has never felt super sturdy.  But now it is just plain rickety.  Contact me on IG if you don't believe it. @ embarrassmom,2,0,2020-4-30,1,0,0
"I am a permanent makeup artist and work in a very small room with poor lighting.  I had a 14"" ring light that I really liked, but just wasn't big enough to adequately light my clients faces, I did like, however, the fact it had a knob to turn on and off and dim, and then another knob to change the color temp (from warm/orange to cool/blue).  I purchased this one, and although I do love the size, and it is very sturdy, I don't love that I cant easily change the color temp.  It comes with warm and cool plastic plates.
