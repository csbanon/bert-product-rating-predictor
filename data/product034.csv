"I believe it is wrong to repeatedly order ink cartridges that last with minimal copying, no more than one to two weeks. After purchasing my HP printer, I am dismayed, unable to complete a minimal amount of copying (no more than the average 50 pages)  without having to repurchase more cartridges. I always have used HP products and ink, confident that I could complete a reasonable amount of printing without running out of ink. Is this a new corporate ploy by the manufacturer to force their valued customers to buy more expensive ink cartridges? Their so-called special ink replacement plan also is misleading, forcing one to purchase the same inadequate quantity of expensive ink cartridges.  This hurts their valued customers who are forced to purchase cheaper and inferior cartridges and force their loyal, valuable customers to purchase their competitor's printers. I will definitely consider this option when I purchase my next printer.",1,1,2020-6-26,1,2,0

WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HP INK. I USED TO PRINT AT LEAST 100 PAGES PER CARTRIDGE BEFORE I HAD TO REPLACE IT. NOT WORTH THE MONEY, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT TAKES WAY TOO LONG TO RECEIVE THE INK AND IM A PRIME MEMBER. WHATS GOING ON WITH PRIME SERVICES SUCH AS PRIME VIDEO AND SHIPPING.

"I have been using this ink for a while now, the only thing I really don‚Äôt like is the alignment page that prints out every single time you install a new cartridge.

I got this for my printer and I loved the price was economical for needing printer ink. Hate when you have to usually pay plus $35 dollars for printer ink... I love that this was affordable.

The printer, wireless HP Deskjet was in a constant state of losing its wireless connection; therefore, I spent hours troubleshooting that included printing occasional test pages. I never got to use the ink for the purpose for which I bought it. And, we know that once one color is empty, the printer does not print. Very frustrating.",1,1,2020-9-8,1,0,0
If you have a hp 3700 before you print be sure it is on black to print black. My printer will always default  to color which uses all the colors to make a black and will eat your ink quick.,5,1,2020-6-18,1,1,0
"This cartridge was empty after printing about 30 pages. Just put it in a few days ago and already it's empty. Maybe it's a fluke, but if so the company should send me a new cartridge.",1,1,2020-8-9,1,1,0
HP always have great products and the ink is know different. I haven't used it yet but this is all I use for my printer and I have never had a problem with the ink just the priceü§£üòÇü§£,5,1,2020-6-7,1,1,1

My ink cartridge definitely did not provide me the 120 pages that it was supposed to.  My best guess is that I got about 30 pages worth of printing-- and I print in draft quality to save ink.  This time I am ordering from Staples.  Disappointed.,2,1,2020-8-5,1,1,0

I ordered this item before I went on vacation.  When I got home and actually installed the new black ink cartridge it was working as normal.  20 or so page later it is telling me it is empty.  I know that can't be true. So disappointed. I bought the HP brand because it is supposed to be better ink but I think I'll go back to the off brand if this is what I get. Of course because I ordered it then went on vacation now i can't get a return! Garbage.,1,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0

"My HP printer is fine WHEN it works. But it most often does not. I bought this expensive cartridge and today had to play with my printer for about an hour, no printing. The printer will print in YELLOW only. I googled the issue and apparently I am not the only one. I am not alone. I fortunately had a back up ink cartridge bought from elsewhere and after another hour of playing with it, I got that cartridge to produce prints.They make these products defective so that you have to buy more of them.

I purchased this ink at the beginning of July. I only used it to print out client Health questionnaires for my clients to fill out when they arrive. I got approximately 55 pages of basic print.
