      "After seeing all the high reviews for these headphones, I purchased them with the expectation that they were going to be amazing, I came to the realization that those reviews were not accurate. Iâ€™m of the belief that those high reviews were left after the initial use of the headphones.Construction quality - They feel flimsy at best. The earphones are comfortable but the unit tends to slide off of ones head and doesnâ€™t stay in place. After using them for a few months one of the earphones broke away from the unit and is only hanging by a wire. For the life of me I canâ€™t figure out how it happened or how it was even staying in place.\n",

      "Absolutely love these. I have no issues. Generally, as long as the volume is high enough, I cannot hear anyone when music is playing (which I guess is the goal) but if it isn't high enough you can still here things. The color is really pretty...these have even fallen a few times and are still working great and perfectly. So they don't seem to break easily. I was little worried about buying some random brand of headphones but no regrets! The sound quality is great. The bass is great. I have no issues with it connecting to bluetooth as long as there are no other devices around it that it is connected to. IE, if my computer is on and my phone is on....it will choose to connect to whichever one the BT picks up first, which seems to always be the one that I don't want it to connect to. The battery lasts a very long time. As an example, one time I left them on a whole day and the battery still lasted a few more days before needing a charge.\n",

      "I have tried many other brands of headphones and comparatively these look much nicer than some of the really expensive brands I have tried. The sound quality is also great and they block outside noise very well. I purchased these for a long haul flight I was taking and they were extremely comfortable and not super bulky and heavy. I am very pleased with the battery life too. Overall these are a great pair of headphones and I would recommend them to anyone, especially if you will be wearing for long periods of time.\n",
