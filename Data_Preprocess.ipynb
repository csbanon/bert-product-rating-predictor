I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.\n",

      "A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money.\n",

      "I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.\n",

Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped. The screen is a solid IPS screen and when you consider the price tag is amazing and beats a lot of the more expensive laptop screens I have seen.\n",

I also added a 2TB SSD for storage. The power plug is kinda flimsy and fragile,  has No microSD card slot, and is very limited in BIOS selections. I tested the graphics running X-Plane 11 flight simulator and it is far more impressive when compared to my old Dell Inspirion i7 8550U. Remember there is a big difference in Ryzen7 3700U (only 4-cores) and Ryzen7 4700U (8-cores). Too bad GPU memory is only 512Mb VRAM.\n",

Then you cannot install any apps that are not in Microsoft store, and you have to use Edge that uses Bing only.  You can turn this off, but only after you have provided your person information.  No command prompt either while in S mode.  Wow just wow.\n",

      "As someone who typically builds their own desktop PCs, i am pleasantly surprised with this laptop. I got this aspire 5 during the prime day sale where it was 260$, and even at its normal price of 306$ its really solid. Acer has videos on youtube that show you how to add an additional hard drive, so that was helpful. I put in a 1TB SSD and another 8GB of ddr4 sodimm ram. There were 2 slots for ddr4 sodimm ram, so I think you could potentially get 16GB total ram in this laptop if you had two 8GB sticks. When i had the laptop open, it APPEARED AS IF you could take out the 128GB PCIE NVME SSD that ships with the laptop and put in a larger one, so that's an idea. I mainly got this laptop to use to play everquest (a very old computer game), and do some light web browsing etc,  and have as a laptop that i can carry around without worrying about dropping a 4000$ laptop on the ground. It has an ethernet port, usb 3.1 ports, hdmi port, etc, so thats convenient compared to my macbook (which only has thunderbolt 3 ports and requires dongles or adapters for everything). The backlit keys are great and the keyboard feels good. If you dont like how the function key operates and you use the F1-F12 keys a lot, you can spam F2 while the computer is restarting and go into the BIOS and change the function key behavior. I am still getting a feel for the battery life so i cant comment too much on that, but the battery lasts a while and it seems to take about 2-3 hours to charge it empty to full. It ships with windows 10 S mode which sucks, you can go to the windows store and \"switch out\" of S mode for the regular windows 10 home operating system. Overall i am really loving this laptop, it was very affordable, easily upgradeable hard drive and memory, and it is working great. The only thing that is a little underwhelming would be the speakers aren't the best and don't go as loud as i would like sometimes.\n",

When I troubleshoot the issue, it says it's fixed, but then the online videos stop loading. So, I can either watch a video without sound or not watch it at all. I called acer customer service, but I only receive a robot voice describing \"special offers\" for other products I may like to purchase. When I decline their offers (as if I'm going to buy another one of their products EVER), it disconnects my line. BUYER BEWARE. So far, I've returned this product once already for faulty technology, and am experiencing similar issues a year later after the warranty has expired (GO FIGURE).\n",

      "I'm sorry, I'm going to have to demerit the ratings a bit.  I purchased three of these PC Laptops for my clinic (external use; not for patient data).  It took me TWO HOURS to set them up.  I put all three on the countertop and just went from one to the other. This is what I always do.  There's always irritation to work around with setting up computers but these were the worst ones yet.  You have to ensure you don't connect them to the internet during setup because if you do ... YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY sign in with your Microsoft account (or create another one).  They have completely removed the \"create local account\" (the traditional way to log in).  If you entered your wireless network info, you have to (a) unplug your modem and (b) restart the computer and start the set-up all over again because there is no way to \"back up\" to the network entry section.  So terrible.  Because they removed the option to choose a local account, their reasoning for this is simply to control you and your computing experience.  For personal use, this may be okay.  For corporate use, not a chance!  The security problems are incredible with this setup.  You're going to get sued!  So -- after this ordeal, windows is set up.  First thing I ALWAYS do is install Google Chrome and then make it default.  Well, MS made that practically impossible too!  There's now a standard \"Windows S Mode Edition.\"  This is purportedly to prevent you from installing unauthorized content to save your computer.  This is nonsense.  It's a way to ensure everyone uses their crappy MS Edge browser.  Their browser always sucked.  Their browser currently sucks.  Their browser will always suck.  That's why people get rid of it.  But they force you to use it.  You have to now download some app that turns MS S Mode off (that MS makes and publishes).  That would be fine, but now Windows uses a digital copy instead of a key and the digital license ... you guessed it ... could not be verified.  Yep, several restarts, updates, and other bologna and finally I was able to install the S Mode bypass so that I could download Chrome.  Then there's the bloatware.  There is so much packaged into windows that bloats it!  I don't want my employees to play any number of games or waste time on unproductive processes.I have yet to really dive in to the computer but superficially, it looks fine.\n",

      "I'm really loving this computer so far!  It's slim, lightweight, and folds flat -- which is needed for me for work since I carry my laptop around a lot.  The battery life is really long, I love how bright the screen is, and my favorite thing so far is the keyboard.  Ever sit down at a new computer/keyboard, and it takes you some adjustment to learn how to type on it without hitting the wrong keys?  Not with this laptop -- there was zero learning curve, and I'm typing 100wpm as always with zero adjustment period.I panicked at first and thought I was going to return it because Chrome wouldn't download, but false alarm!  I turned off Microsoft's S Mode, and I was good to go.  I work from this machine, and all of my applications are Chrome-based or in MS Office.  Works perfectly and fast.  Loving it so far!\n",

      "Just abominable, at the absolute worst time in my life possible... Things kept not working, I kept calling customer service, barely intelligible robotic people kept telling me I needed to reset the hard drive and wipe out everything I'd put on it (again). Final straw was the touchpad suddenly stopped working - after an agonizing 2 hours on the phone, conclusion was a hardware problem, no choice but to return it. Also, the sound is WAY too soft - I tried all these \"fixes\" I found online, nothing helped. Why would you need \"fixes\" for something so basic as acceptable sound in 2019?? Went to Best Buy, the dude just winced when I told him I had bought an Acer. DO NOT BUY. I hardly ever bother to review products one way or the other, but I owe this one to you.\n",

      "The things that set this laptop apart from others in the price range are latest generation Ryzen mobile processor, IPS screen, Nvme M.2 SSD, These are features found in much more expensive laptops. The one weak point is the amount of RAM at only 4GB, however that is easily remedied by adding another stick of ram to the laptop after buying it.Adding Ram to the system is fairly easy. There are 10 screws on the bottom panel you need to remove, then gently pry out the back cover with a guitar pick or other thin and rigid plastic device. I used an old credit card. This will open the bottom of the laptop, and then you can access the RAM socket to install additional memory. You can also add a secondary hard drive , or replace the m.2 SSD drive with one of a larger capacity.\n",

      "I rarely review products but figured this may be helpful to some. For starters, some background context: I am in my mid-20s and have long since finished uni. I am not a gamer. I primarily use my laptop(s)/tablets for streaming shows/movies; occasionally working from home; and crafting/design editing. I used to go through every iteration of a MacBook but, while nice, soon found myself not really utilizing all of its features & could no longer justify its price-point (especially since I do still have an iPhone).This laptop is a STEAL for ~$300. I did my research and honestly, like a majority of the other reviews here said, the Acer Aspire 5 blows every other product in its price bracket out of the water. That said, I went into this fully knowing I wanted an inexpensive laptop and that, because of that constraint, whatever I ended up purchasing would most likely have some limitations. If you purchased this and are disappointed about the specs in correlation to it being ~$300.... I really don't know what to tell you other than that you definitely were looking in the wrong place.\n",

      "Received this on November 20, 2019 to gift to my daughter for Christmas.  I ended up finding a gaming laptop for a decent price through Black Friday and decided to keep this for myself.  Unboxed and booted up and as soon as the blue screen turned on, I noticed a few small white vertical lines (dead pixels?)n the left side of screen.  Now I know from the moment it was in my possession it was safely cared for hidden in a closet.  Immediately contacted Amazon and set up a refund and shipping label for me to send back.  The box it arrived in wasn't damaged in any way so it has to be hardware related.  I even went into BIOS and the lines still appeared.  Higher standards should be set on these laptops.  Hopefully my new one doesn't have the same issue.  Get a protection plan!!!\n",

      "The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:\n",

I was prepared to spend $600 or better to get what I wanted when I started searching.After reading multiple reviews on Amazon and other sites. I pulled the trigger.

      "I've been using Acer laptops for over a decade. In fact, I'm still using an Acer laptop that's over 12 years old. Acer builds great laptops. So, why did I rate this Acer with only two stars? Because Acer has boxed me in with Windows 10, the worst operating system on the planet.Win10 is plagued with security issues with every update, and Microsoft's grossly overpaid geeks can't seem to remedy the situation. Because of that, I decided to switch to Windows 8.1 which is running on my other Acer just fine, or even dumping Windows altogether and installing Linux. as a second operating system in a dual-boot configuration.\n",

      "I am a big fan of Chromebooks (which this isn't), but there were a few simple problems with integration to home networks.  There are work-arounds and dual booting and dealing with developer mode.  When a recent cheap Chromebook died, I looked for a replacement, but either the work arounds were really slow, or the Chromebooks recommended specifically for that purpose were super expensive.  Then I came across this (again, it is not a chromebook), and figured I'd just install Linux on it and use it for web browsing and connecting to various services on my home network.It worked flawlessly.  The supplied SSD Hard Drive is somewhat small (plenty of room if you do most of your work in the cloud though), but they do supply a mounting kit and if you need it a YouTube video for how to install a larger drive in the computer.  One slightly disappointing thing is that I had a few 1 TB SSDs sitting around, and the plan was to toss one in the laptop and reclaim the 128 GB SSD to use in an enclosure as a USB drive to transfer files/hold a dev env between work and home and support for various friends.  The included 128GB drive is just the chip on a board and doesn't look easily removable, and wouldn't mount in any of my enclosures even if I could remove it.  So, adding a large disk just adds another drive in the OS, it doesn't replace the one it comes with.\n",

      "I bought this in mid-February  when my 7 year old Acer laptop was about kaput (wouldn't update, multiple errors at startup).  About a month later, COVID-19 hit, and I was sent home to work full time. My new laptop got a crash course in constant usage; 10-11 hours a day, 5-6 days a week. Its performance has not disappointed!  This is a little workhorse!  Screen is vibrant and easy to look at (I'm so glad I decided on the 15.6\" screen instead of the 14 inch!) Keys are comfortable to the touch. I did attach a mouse which makes things so much easier.  I honestly dont have any complaints at all.  It may not be a top gaming computer, but for what I need it for, I couldn't ask for better performance or user experience.  I didn't understand the \"S mode\" comments I read in the reviews. Just follow instructions either in the Q&A sections of reviews or look it up on You Tube to take Windows out of S mode and you'll be fine. It's actually pretty simple.  If I can do it, anyone can do it.  I still don't understand that whole S mode thing, but I suppose it's designed to generate Microsoft more revenue.  To summarize, this laptop has been a lifesaver for me during my work from home experience, which has no end in sight yet. Its durable, reliable and easy to work on.  The only real drawback I have found is the battery. Battery lasts maybe 3 to 4 hours before it needs to be charged. I wish it had a 12 hour battery so I didn't need to be plugged in all the time. That way I could unplug during the day for some additional mobility, and then charge overnight. I would highly recommend this laptop!\n",

Also i have hooked this up to my Sony TV set for netflix and youtube via HDMI cable.  i had experienced sound dropping from the TV - that is i can see the video but no sound was coming out from my TV set.

      "Pros of this machine:  It is indeed much faster than my old laptop.  The screen quality is very good.  The backlit keyboard is nice.  It is also VERY light, and that is great.Cons so far (3 days):  There is no light on the keyboard to tell you when cap lock or num lock are on.  I found this to be a problem straight out of the box setting it up when I couldn't tell what were the capital letters in the password I was putting in!  Secondly, a good bit of the set up involved telling Microsoft exactly how I want them to spy on me, but not giving me any options of not being spied on.  My millenial daughter says people don't care about this any more, but I find it offensive that MS thinks they have the right to know everything I do on my computer and to put ads on it at their whim.  I only get to choose whether I want them personalized or not.  My word. It's none of their business! Thirdly, when I tried to install the program from my job that I bought this computer to use, of course it wouldn't install because of S mode.  When I told it I wanted out of S mode it told me I had to go to the MS Store and buy MS Home for $139!!  My thanks to all the other reviewers who said I could get out of S mode for free.  I finally googled it and MS's own website had the directions I needed.  Note that when I went into settings it was telling me the computer couldn't activate Windows in big red letters.  I had to respond to that first before the \"Switch out of S Mode\" prompts appeared, but I finally did manage to get out of it.\n",

      "I wanted to love this laptop. It's an outstanding bargain, by far the best in its price range. It's elegant, well equipped for the price with a good display, and expandable with room for more memory and an additional SSD (both are very cheap now). I had trouble with the touchpad, which required a tap vs a click. But I had to RETURN it because of the horrible Windows 10s, which only uses software from the Microsoft store. I spent hours trying to switch it to real Windows home, supposedly \"easy\" to do. I'm pretty technically qualified. But although I did switch it, the first Windows update switched it BACK to 10s irrevocably. 10s is just not usable for much more than web browsing.\n",

Great value for money. If you're willing to deal with regular problems and that cheap pricepoint is all you're looking for, this is a good option.Pros: Backlit keys regularly turn off to save battery. Haven't found a setting to adjust this, but there's that. All keys have good travel, with a quiet clickiness. Quick activation, but they're thin enough that you won't notice it.

      "Looking for a laptop for my daughter for remote learning. Originally picked AUSU with Ryzen 3500u (didn’t know 4500u is available). For the price you paid, you will get the best value with this laptop. Played it for a whole day, I am good with the screen and performance. FYI, a bay for adding an internal hard drive is provided, so you can add a bigger hard drive later on. Single 8G ram is standard (expandable slot available). Furthermore, the dedicated video seems not necessary. According to some testing sites, the integrated APU is only slightly slower than the RX640. I would save the $50 for a hard drive. No card reader no finger print don’t matter to me since the laptop is for my daughter remote school.4500u should out-perform almost all Intel i-5. Specially it can let you play low setting games in good FPS without a dedicated card.\n",

Turned it on and set up and the first thing I did was download World of Warcraft. It downloaded fast. It runs at about medium settings out of the box. I upgraded the SSD to a 900gb and put another stick of ram in and I can run *WoW* on high settings! Load screens zip by. I also tested on call of duty and fortnite and everything ran smoothly. This is the best bang for your buck, in my opinion. Put $100 into it and it's a beast! The screen is very clear as well and is very hd. The keys light up like a gaming computer and makes it easy to see the keys. The only downside to this laptop is the keyboard. I took some pictures of it. It's the number pad and the enter key. It's not a full number pad or enter key. Sometimes I hit the wrong keys due to this. It's minor, I'll be gaming on a different keyboard anyways! Enjoy!!! Buy it and don't look back!\n",

Acer said it was \"an internal crack and therefore not covered by the warranty.\"  They wanted $250 to replace the screen for a $350 laptop.  Ridiculous - it makes no sense something that happened \"internally\" would not be covered by their warranty on a brand new product.

My ONLY gripe is the sound is AWFUL. I mean so bad you can barely hear anything at times. What's worse is that after searching myself for enhancement or equalization controls and finding none, I wasted 45 minutes waiting for Acer tech support to find out this updated version of Windows 10 no longer offers the enhancement or equalization feature! And the techie tells me at first my speakers are only 3 watts... then he corrected himself and said THESE speakers are only TWO watts! So, if you want to purchase external speakers, keep it hooked up to your tv, or use ear plugs all the time, maybe this computer is for you. Otherwise, this computer is only good for the totally deaf! My cheap phone has better speakers than this thing. I'm not even talking sound QUALITY, I mean just hearing in general! Come on, ACER, why did you totally blow it on speakers that barely speak!\n",

Interestingly, I installed VirtualBox so that I could see how the Ryzen 3 3200U would handle virtualization. As it turns out, my Windows 10 virtual machine somehow ran even better than the shipped Windows 10. I also created virtual machines for Elementary OS and the new Linux Mint 19.2 beta.

      "The laptop I received for this review was opened prior to me actually opening it. I do not know if this was a return or something but I tested it out anyways. Based on normal use I say this is OK with the exception of some weird glitching in which the laptop screen momentarily turns all black. It has happened around three times already. I was just using it for browsing and video watching. It has only been a couple of days of use and this is already happening. Something is wrong with this but I am no techie so I don't know what. I did the usual troubleshooting...turn it off and on again. It didn't fix the problem.Beside this, the screen is really nice to look at. The bezels are thin which makes the viewing of shows wonderful. The screen is more matte than glassy which I find that I prefer compared to the glossy screen on my Asus (which performs way better than the Acer one without a question since mine is super expensive). The keyboard is easy to type and the layout of it is useful in that they had enough space to put a full number pad to the right. The power button threw me off because it wasn't at the side of the laptop it was found on the keyboard itself (upper right). Lasting capabilities is around 5-6 hours of continuous usage for me.

      "We are average users, not hard core gamers. For someone that runs a few light to medium programs, photo/video editing, streaming, school work, etc., this computer has what it takes. Tried Macbooks, which are great, but 2 to 3 times the price of this Acer. Our criteria was we wanted LED backlit HD screen, backlit keyboard, aluminum shell/case, attractive, full Qwerty keyboard with numeric keypad, good battery life, fingerprint reader, ample ports with HDMI, light weight, slim bezel,  and fast. Lastly, it had to be within a budget of under $600. This Acer meets all we wanted. There's nothing wrong with conventional HDD if you know how to take care of your machine. By that I mean, KEEP IT CLEANED! Acer, in its infinite wisdom, pre-installed a utility called ACER CARE CENTER. In this single utility you can defrag, clean out the junk, clean the disk, check health of battery, hard drive, etc. Use it! Some have complained their Acer is slow. Have you cleaned it? Expect to spend the first 3 or 4 hours just getting all the Windows 10 updates installed. After just that, I ran the Acer Care utility to find the hard drive was 28% fragmented, and disk needed to be cleaned. So, defragged and cleaned, then went on to add our many programs. When all done with everything, defragged and cleaned again. It boots up in 15 seconds. Battery life on any laptop is dependent upon the programs and use. Don't expect 10 hours. 5 to 7 hours of word processing, surfing, video/photo editing, and some streaming. Even at current sale price of $349 it's still worth it. Guess time will tell if it holds up, but initially it is a superb laptop with great specs for the money!\n",

Updated November 5, 2019..after receiving it after repairs it has gone out again. I bought this in July and Acer says my warranty is out and I cant get my money back.

I originally ordered a 1 TB mechanical drive to install, based on an Amazon recommendation, and it was a 9.5mm drive.

      "By itself, this is an excellent device.  However, due to terrible support and shady practices, it's been wildly cheapened by Acer.1. Acer installed their own adware on my device without my knowledge or consent.  Worse, they created unchangeable notification settings, buried the installation files in a hidden directory, abused the character limit to hide it from the program removal tool; either hid it from the registry with deceptive location and naming, or used a scheduled executable and won't provide the information necessary to determine whether simply deleting the files is safe.\n",

Normally, you have to hold \"Fn\" and hit an F key to use the function, but it was reversed on this machine. Also, the keyboard backlight turned itself off after 20 seconds of inactivity whether or not it was plugged in. It kind of defeats the purpose of a backlit keyboard, in my opinion, when you can't see the keys before you start typing.At any rate, both the F key and backlight issues were mostly fixed when I updated the BIOS directly from the Acer support site. I was then able to find settings for both in BIOS and disable automatic function key and backlight timeout. My only gripe is that there doesn't seem to be any way to keep the backlight on for more than 20 seconds when unplugged, no matter the power settings or BIOS configuration. Lots of Googling and worthless Acer chat support sessions later, I'm convinced there's no workaround.\n",

I rarely use an optical drive, so the lack of one was no issue for me. I have a portable external that i bought a few years back for under $20 that works just fine. The display is awesome. I have a touch screen laptop for work an I think in two years I  touched the screen less than ten times. So this not having a touch screen was no big deal. the laptop boots fast thanks to the on-board 128 GB SSD where the only thing I have installed there is the OS. Everything else goes to the SD I added.  I am comparing this to a HP elite book from about 5 years ago with that had 500 GB SSD, Intel i5 processor and 16 GB RAM. This Laptop is much snappier that that elite book and about a ton lighter. Plus I no longer need to deal with the issue of carrying a display port to HDMI adapter around. A few things to remember... take it out of Windows S mode if you want to do anything more than simple tasks using Windows Store Apps and be sure to provision the second hard drive if you put it in.

Waited a bit and called amazon tech who had me repeat the same steps. I’ve now been on hold for 25 minutes while they reach out to acer to see if there is something else they can do.7/20 Update: I waited on hold for nearly 40 minutes while the Amazon tech stated she was on hold with acer. She came back after and said that she couldn’t reach them despite their call center being 24 hours but would call me at 5pm on Friday.  Friday and I did not receive a call.  I checked hours later to see she had sent an email and told me to call Acer directly. By this time it’s late and I have plans. I therefore called Acer this morning. Anytime the computer is left on without using for 30 minutes it freezes - resetting the battery doesn’t help- the power button just doesn’t work and it has to sit for 24 to reset itself. They suspect a display, charger or battery issue and offered to send me a shipping label as I can’t print anything without a working computer. As I’ve had this computer for less than two days and it had issues within hours I advise that I will be returning to amazon for a replacement. Amazon tells me it’ll be days before I get my replacement. Hopefully it works!\n",

You will want to update the graphics driver via device manager. The rest of the drivers were up to date. Sound quality was a concern. I went into the Realtek manager and switched from music mode to game mode and it made a big difference in the volume for me. Your mileage may vary.

It also comes with Windows 10 S mode so I quickly uninstalled S mode after doing all necessary Windows updates. As it only comes with 4GB of RAM I bought a stick of Crucial 8GB RAM to replace the 4GB stick with. Unfortunately access to the RAM requires removing the back of the laptop. There is no other access panel to do this. While I had the back of the laptop off I also expanded the hard disk space with a Kingston 240 GB HDD since after Windows 10 updates there was only about 95GB of hard drive space left on the 128GB SSD. This laptop comes with 4 screws to attach the HDD to the bracket included on the motherboard. It also has the cable taped to the bottom of the back panel. So for about $60 more I added 8GB of RAM and 240GB more of hard disk space. It does have some bloat ware which I would recommend removing especially if you don't add a HDD. I would recommend this laptop for students or anybody that just wants a solid entry level computer that is expandable.\n",

      "This year, both our old laptops gave up the ghost and we had to buy new ones. I first did research for my wife. She likes to move her laptop to various chairs around the house. Once online, connected to the world through WiFi, she looks up news and other things, checks her email, does banking, and watches a few videos. Sometimes we talk to family and friends on Skype. I know a lot more about computers than she does, so she asked me to find one for her. A touch-screen wasn't important, so I was looking for a thin, attractive, high-resolution screen laptop, with reasonable speed and a solid operating system. We've also tried tablets , but without a decent physical keyboard, found them lacking. The bonus was, judging by her needs, I didn't think we needed to break the bank to find a decent machine at the lower end of the scale. When we bought it, just a month ago at the time of this writing, the price was a hair under $350. Today, a quick review of the product page shows they've shoved that up by $70 to $420. Why?? I have to say, that might have been a deal-breaker.However, I did choose this Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop. It arrived and I went to work to set it up for her. It was pretty intuitive. Plug it in, press the power button, and follow the prompts. Easy. However, we like to use a lot of apps not made (or even approved) by Microsoft. The laptop comes with Windows 10 on it, in Microsoft's \"S\" mode. In other words, they set it up so you can only get Microsoft programs and apps that come from their online store. If that doesn't suit you, don't despair: you can opt out of that \"Microsoft-only\" mode during setup.\n",

      "Okay so my old HP Chromebook broke and I start School in the fall, so I needed a laptop ASAP. I searched the internet, all different websites, did lots of research and I came across this one.  I love it, everything about it, for one the screen quality is beautiful and it has a backlit keyboard. I played the sims on and it ran perfectly fine. I got also an extra set of ram so I could update it to 8 GB. I didn't see anything about a touchscreen in the description, I am not a fan of touchscreen anyway. This laptop is fast so I'm not sure what others mean and It hasn't gotten hot unless I game for a while. I got it recently and it came in 8 days. I'll update if I have any issues but so far I'm in love.\n",

      "Nothing here to fall in love with except maybe the price. The GPU appears to reserve 1GB of the available 4GB installed memory, the system will have near to 3GB available when operating. I'm a little surprised that Windows 10 operates with that little memory. An additional 4GB memory module is fairly inexpensive and it looks like the GPU will reserve a 1GB chunk on the second memory stick so you will have about 6GB available, which is plenty for most applications and the GPU will be happy. I was able to install 2x8GB memory modules for about $60, so memory is not a big issue. Part of what sold me on this is the NVMe boot SSD. The speed is disappointing,1.6GB read and 420MB/s write. The read speed is good, but the write speed is more like a high end SATA SSD. The brand name NVMe on my desktop runs 2.6/1.6GB read/write speeds with the same test utility. Not a deal breaker, just something to be aware of. I did install a WD blue 500GB SSD into the expansion slot. It runs 350/305 MB/s read/write which, again, is not bad but could be better. Battery life, screen brightness, and audio are acceptable for a laptop.Having said all of that, I did purchase a second one of these for my personal/work use. I am adding a good quality NVMe boot SSD with 16GB memory. I am also adding a 1TB WD Blue SSD. The Ryzen 3 CPU is a mid/low end model that most people will be absolutely happy with, I am. I do some programming with the Microsoft Visual Studio tools. This works well.\n",

      "Great laptop for the price.  Add 4-8GB more of RAM and a 1TB hard drive (easy enough to do) and this laptop will give you just about all you need short of medium-hard gaming.  The keyboard is nice, screen is great, mouse pad OK, decent battery life, and it has most inputs/outputs you might need.  If you are looking to save some sheckles, this is the laptop for you.If you are undecided between the i3 or Ryzen chip, the extra $40ish dollars would be better spent on RAM or an internal hard drive.  The i3 might be a little better, but it won't be noticable.  The Ryzen with extra RAM will probably perform better than the i3 anyway.\n",

      "This has Windows 10-S & I hate it. So I registered this laptop thru MS and then turned off the \"S\" mode feature on this laptop. I prefer Firefox or Chrome for my browsers....not Edge. 15.6\" monitor....good picture quality. Horrible sound quality. NO SD card reader or DVD/CD burner. I had to buy external units on both for this laptop. Why Acer deleted the DVD/CD burner unit on this device is beyond me since they are rather thin in nature on laptops anyways. Lit keyboard...stays lit for maybe 15 seconds.....interesting feature and wished it stayed lit all the time. Needs at least 1 more USB 2.0 or 3.0 port. 128gb Solid State HD.....makes it speedy to power up. Only 4 gbs of memory.....which I order 8 gbs more memory for this device.What is most disgusting with this so-called \"new\" laptop from Acer is the 2nd hard drive slot is too small/too shallow to fit a laptop mechanical or Solid State hard drive in it at all and the contacts from the laptop to the 2nd hard drive do NOT meet up and thus.....you can NOT install the 2nd hard drive in this device. I had to use an external hard drive via one of few USB ports to put my music and some videos on since the built-in hard drive on this thing is 128 gbs. Also, I had to use another USB port for the external digital camera card reader I had to order as well. And of course, I use an external mouse meaning I used the third and final USB port on this laptop. Not sure why Acer, HP and other brands don't add 1 more USB port on lower priced laptops.....should not cost more just to add 1 more USB port....even if it's the slower USB 2.0 port.\n",

      "I bought this laptop to use to learn how to code on the go, but the quality of the mouse pad is very, very poor and so I am going to return it. When coding, you frequently have to move the mouse to highlight specific pieces of text to do some sort of edit in your code. Unfortunately, the mousepad on this laptop is not accurate or precise, and when trying to make fine movements with the mousepad, the mouse moves in very, very small skips instead of a smooth, consistent glide. This makes it impossible to move the mouse quickly and precisely, because when trying to execute precise movements, you have to slow down and course correct several times when you get the mouse close to where you want it to go (instead of being able to quickly move the mouse to the precise location you intend). This lack of precision is very frustrating, and makes the user experience so slow that I am going to return it. I purchase laptops for at least 2 years of consistent use, and I just don't want to endure that kind of frustration every single day as I'm trying to give all of my attention towards building a technical skill. For those who appreciate speed and accuracy with the mousepad (just like with a mac laptop if you've ever used one - nothing too crazy, just very smooth and controllable motion that follows your input perfectly), I would advise you not to get this laptop, because I think you could be very frustrated with the user experience.As a final note, this laptop also had issues running Ubuntu 18.04 - whenever I closed the lid, the laptop would suspend (this is totally expected; \"suspend\" is just means \"sleep\" for linux), but whenever I reopened the lid, the laptop would not resume (turn back on) and I would have to force shut down and restart it (every single time). I could not find a solution to this issue after scouring the internet and trying a bunch of different fixes for about 4 or 5 hours. Some linux distributions have small issues with certain laptops, so for whatever reason Ubuntu 18.04 and this laptop just did not work well together. This issue was also frustrating and made for a very diminished user experience, although I may have been able to find another distribution that would have worked with this laptop. But for both of these reasons (very much mainly the first reason, the mousepad), I am returning this laptop. Don't want to deal with an issue like that for 2 years, rather just spend a little more money. Hope this is helpful.\n",

      "After a lot of research and watching youtube videos that did pro/con reviews on this Acer laptop, I decided to make the plunge. We only needed the laptop for work, so there will be no graphic intensive applications and no gaming on  it either. I debated on upgrading the memory to 8GB, but once again, how we are using the laptop determined that this step was not necessary. All we had to do to get it work ready was to disable Windows 10 \"S\" mode, which was really easy. Installed chrome, since all the work stuff is on Google Drive and other Google apps.Screen is very nice. I've seen better, but for the price, it really stands out. I'm not much of a touch pad kind of person, so my wireless mouse is my go to navigation tool. Even so, the touch pad is adequate and will do the job, but, I'm too attached to my mouse. Keyboard is nice, I do like the backlight for late night emails. I haven't pushed the battery to the limits yet, so I will reserve judgement until a later date. Processing speed is very nice, no lag, but remember, we're not gaming or heavy video editing. I do not miss or require a touch screen. I have an iPad if I feel the need to use my finger instead of my mouse. In all, a great budget laptop that will do all that we need it to do, Loving it so far!\n",

      "What at first sight caught my attention was the design of this laptop, minimalist to put it in some way, having it in my hands because I am not disappointed at all, the build quality is good for a laptop of this price (I acquired it  for $ 309.99 dollars), the touchpad is of a considerable size because it allows you to navigate freely and the gestures, are quite intuitive, the bad thing that you notice is that you click manually (if you prefer since it is better to do it through the configuration of two fingers  ) The touchpad is perceived loose, cleaning it shows as if it moved to the sides.  The keyboard is magnificent, the position of the keys is just what you need, the noise it makes when you type it is not annoying, it has lighting which helps you a lot when using it in low light, it is programmed to turn off if you do not use it  which is good if you are watching a movie, reading or watching videos on YouTube.  The screen is very good, to be honest I was very surprised, its quality is quite clear the colors are not appreciated false or over saturated, the image quality it offers is something that will fascinate you outdoors because you have to look for a good angle of that  shape will not be affected, the brightness is decent if you want to lower it to a minimum and when you choose to upload it to the maximum you will appreciate the clear images without perceiving that feeling of discomfort.  In terms of performance I can not add much, of course the programs I use because I do not consider them something that requires too much resources from the processor, it is worth mentioning that I chose the laptop with an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U Dual-Core Processor 2.6GHz.  I consider it a laptop for normal day-to-day use, to perform tasks in Excel, to do documents, to browse the web, are things that make them very easily the solid state disk (128 SSD) allows you to open programs with  very easily, even with the basic specifications you will have a very good performance and speed, I have installed Autocad 3D which is the program that I normally have installed on my MacBook Pro and it turns out that it runs without any complications.  Windows 10 version S is installed at the factory.The audio is quite good for the price of the laptop, the music is clear but do not expect to have a serious and powerful sound I will only tell you that it is good, what I disliked was the fact when I put the laptop on my legs or on the surface  From my bed the audio is compromised. The battery life I would put about 5 hours with a medium intensive use.\n",

      "Looking at all of the good reviews this laptop got and for the low price; I figured why not. This laptop came to me damaged. The finger sensor pad was popped up on one side and would not go back down. I contacted Amazon who told me to contact Acer. What a hassle. I bought this for online courses, so I couldn't be without it for long. I told this to the reps at Acer who were \"overseas\". After multiple phone calls and concerns, they assured me they put a \"rush\" on my repair so it shouldnt be longer than a week. Two and a half weeks later, I received my laptop. The sensor pad was fixed, but i cannot type more that a few sentences without the menus popping up from below and the right side. Super annoying and I'm really frustrated with this thing. Maybe I just got a lemon, I dont know. I DO know that I will never buy another Acer brand anything. Between the product and customer service, no thanks.Next time, I will spend the extra money and get a good laptop.\n",

      "Got this as a prime day deal at a great price, but it's a nice deal even at the retail price. At minimum the memory should be upgraded to really make this a great machine, the cheapest upgrade is a single 4GB DDR4-2400 memory stick that would double the memory and enable dial channel operation for a nice performance boost. It works great with Linux as long as you stick with the latest kernels, the stock Debian/buster 4.19 kernel had some issues, but it works perfectly with the 5.2 kernel. Despite being a slim lightweight laptop with a large and bright screen, it is very easy to replace the memory and hard drive, unlike many recent premium laptops that are glued shut with non-removable components. The back cover can be easily removed to gain access to the memory and ssd. It comes with a 128GB NVMe x2 M.2 2280 WD SN520 SSD, that can be replaced with any 2280 NVMe ssd. Be aware though that only 2 PCIe lanes are connected, so any x4 ssd will run in x2 mode, limiting the bandwidth, but it's still much faster than SATA based SSDs. There are 2 DDR4 SODIMM slots, one occupied by the 4GB stick that comes with the machine, but can be removed to install a bigger stick. The processor supports DDR4-2400 speeds. I have installed 2x8GB memory, and based on the measured memory bandwidth I can confirm that it operates in dual-channel mode. The machine also has an empty slot for a 2.5\" drive, which is useful for those that need lots of cheap storage on board, but using that would reduce battery life. The processor is pretty fast, on par with Intel Core i3 netbooks, and the integrated  Radeon graphics easily beats the integrated graphics in Intel chips, especially with the upgraded dual channel memory, but obviously this is not a gaming laptop.Pros: Great price, upgradable memory (32GB should work), upgradable 2280 NVMe SSD, empty 2.5\" HDD slot, beautiful screen, gigabit RJ45 port, lightweight\n",

You can use the link below to find it here on Amazon. Had to do research to make sure this mem stick was compatible and it sure is. Watched a youtube video on how to install, and it went in flawlessly (*make sure to disconnect all power before installing, including the internal battery cable!!).I also upgraded the hard drive capacity. This computer has a built in SDD stick, but also has a slot for another 2.5\" SDD (reccommended over a rotating hard drive, those wear out sooner). So I found a 500GB SDD at Best buy for around $74.

Start in one corner, pull up until it pops off and then work your way around to \"pop\" the whole cover off.

Good luck trying to find a high quality PC for gaming under $800.00.  With that said, if you are thinking you can play a bunch of high end games on this unit, my advice to you is \"not to buy this unit for gaming or heavy downloading\".

But after a little over a month (and having really only used it 3 or 4 times in that month), the screen went black but the back-light on the keyboard was still on. So, I figured it just needed to be charged. I left it plugged in for a few hours and then checked on it. Still, lit keys but no screen. So I changed to a different outlet and left it to charge some more. Came back to it, same thing. I tried following their support suggestion of resetting the battery using the tiny button in the back but it made no difference. I never took it out of \"S\" mode, and never even downloaded any apps or installed any programs. Basically, just checked my email a few times. Now when I plug it in, nothing lights up. The adapter on the charger doesn't have any indicator light to show that it's working, so it could be a faulty power cord.I'm going to attempt to call their customer support line and see if they can provide me any answers.

There was too little storage (128gb), too little ram (4gb) and it ran windows 10 in S mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a pretty good computer even though storage is low.but for 350 you can't expect everything. It runs good with very little hiccups. A good basic computer but better than most in this price range. Not disappointed.\n",

      "WOW when my friend recommended this laptop to me I trusted him cause he's a gamer and it does work AMAZING and the graphics are amazing. It downloaded all 4 expansion packs of the sims 3 onto the computer in like an hour/ hour n a half?? (Typically that could take ALL DAY with any ol chump computer) it ran 3 expansion packs smooth and seemlessly however I will say when I go into buy or build mode it loads for a long long time before enter build / buy mode. And when I added a horse to my family in sims 3 (while playing the game with sims 3 pets, sims 3 supernatural and sims 3 island Paradise) It lagged super hard every couple minutes so I had to delete the horse ): I was sad. I had more expectations. I'll try to add more space onto the laptop and see if that fixes the lag issue but the only thing I bought it for was to play sims3. I do not use it for anything else. It has no files on it nothing. I haven't even as much browsed the internet other than to download origin to be able to install the games themself. I'll update if I add more space to the computer and then add another horse and say how it goes!!\n",

      "Slim and light, very nice Windows 10 install, fabulous screen quality, lighted keyboard, great key touch and full num pad.  Much faster than I expected for this low price (AMD processor).  Boots fast, loads pages fast.  Speaker volume a bit low but I use a soundbar and the audio quality is amazing coming out of this computer.  Modest storage but I don't care, I use the cloud.  Impressive battery life.  Fast charge.  Aluminum cover ...  classy look.  No bloatware.  I have owned many PCs, I don't think I have ever liked one better.  After one week I could not be happier.  Top rated budget laptop.  Acer has really hit the bullseye with this series.  Dollar value, no way  you can beat this machine.  Thirty years in IT, I am very picky .... this thing is a keeper.Update three months in ...I like it even better now than I did three months ago.\n",

I play very simple games, I watch Netflix, email, facebook etc, very basic stuff. well let the buyer beware. at least now I know to stay away from acer and anyone who would sell such a shoddy product as this.

Unfortunately this laptop has NO DVD drive, so I bought an external one. It also has NO SD card/Micro card slot. I bought an external one of those as well. Then there were the hours of messing with Windows 10 in S mode to get OUT of S mode. And removing the bloatware? That'll drive you to drink. This thing has next to no RAM/ storage and needs to be upgraded almost out of the box.  I'm already out $$ buying the \"extras\" that used to come standard on laptops. Really disgusted that this thing functions like an overgrown tablet. Lesson learned and I'll be smarter next time!\n",

      "I got this laptop to use at work not for work. I wanted something usable to play some light gaming and to stream movies and search some things also do some light editing.  So far I only gamed and streamed. Works pretty well and love the screen quality. For all you gamers out there looking for a budget laptop look somewhere else. Lol. It really isnt bad for gaming but big title games that involve crazy amount of energy and performance this is no good. Example: arch survival = f*** no. PUB G = yes. I played payday 2 and crap settings. Everything low or off except texture quality to medium. Runs pretty well. Dont look so good but it runs. Killing floor 2. Runs wonderfully on low setting. Hitman 2 runs wonderful on low settings. If you aren't too picky you could run a lot of games. What would also help (I have not done this just yet) get another 4gb or 8gb RAM. Easy to open up put it in extra slot and screw it shut. (Takes 5mins to screw) I have not done this yet. And will update when I do. Also external drives work pretty well. I run everything but windows off a external SSD and have had zero problems. This laptop functions with schooling, work, casual light gaming, video streaming. All for under 500 bucks. Not to shabby.  I use daily at work for few hours and heating isnt bad at all. Extra 8gb ram (30ish bucks) so overall this laptop does what I need it to do. And for games I forgot to mention I can pull 60fps if setting are adjusted correctly.\n",

      "So I bought this laptop on prime-day for school and so far it has been good. I upgraded the ram from 4 GB to 16 GB but only 13.9 GB was usable (weird). I have not played any games on it. The laptop turns on fast and the overall speed is good. The picture quality is very excellent. Now the keyboard was a little turn off. The keys feel like they will brake and they are small. Most of the time the laptop fans are fine and quite. But once in a while it starts working hard and it gets loud. The USB slots are a little tight. It doesn't go in smoothly and go out smoothly. I wouldn't recommend putting the computer on a blanked or something of sort. Only on something hard. Otherwise for my intended purpose it was worth the price.As for the Windows S mode if you go into the windows store there is a free app that let's you switch out of it. You need a windows account to download and install it.\n",

      "Acer Maufacturers Warranty service is at best a sham at worst a scam. We purchased a computer for our 8 year old. During COVID, a stressful time for all us, my 8 year old used it for remote learning. After 8 months the screen went black. As directed by Acer Service we payed $60.00 to ship it to Acer for repair under the warranty. They told us the damage was not covered under the warranty and charged us almost $260.00 for the repair. There was not a scratch on the screen. Completely dishonorable service.\n",

      "My relatively new Chromebook fell apart and I needed a replacement. I wasn’t real happy with the serious limitations of the Chromebook so I caved and went with Windows 10. It requires a lot of customization and tweaking but it’s ok once you get it streamlined. This comes with S Mode which is the very first thing I got rid of. Fortunately all you need to do is go to the Microsoft Store and search for S Mode. You can undo it in about 2 seconds. The display is very nice. Sound is decent. For $350 this is a great deal. My girlfriend is even considering getting one.\n",

      "So far, so good.  I got basic computing needs with an energy efficient level of hardware, and tried seeing what it would do for gaming.  It seems to stutter processor and integrated gpu wise for games but that was to be expected.  However, I paired it with two 8gb RAM upgrades and this bad boy can perform.  The max is 20gb of RAM.  For those that can allow the upgrade of a 16gb sodimm ddr4 RAM I suggest you do it.  The result is a modern, well designed piece of computing.  It runs emulators with ease on games you already own.  It does video editing and music editing very well. As far as processor goes its slightly better than an i3.  Graphics are better than your typical integrated but not by much.  I like the keyboard backlight and the feel of the laptop is satisfying.  I own other acer products and they generally receive favorable mention.  This might be a better buy over the higher end ones if you just upgrade the RAM, much like the other user said.  The sound is surprisingly good but you'll prefer using a headset for better ranges.  I rate it 9/10 overall for upgradability and ease of doing so, performance plugged in, size, form factor, feel, quality of screen, and simplicity of design.  Highly recommended even for 2020.Update: Though I knew it wasn't a gaming laptop before I purchased it, and the battery has dipped to 50%, it's still worth the purchase.  I am able to play Skyrim at  High settings at native resolution at 60 fps.  Doesn't handle anti aliasing or  vsync too well, however.\n",

      "This an honest review and I'm in IT as a job. I am furthering my education and wanted something for education, light gaming, and streaming some movies every now and then. So here it goes.PROS: Amazing big bright nice resolution screen at this price point! Love the backlit keyboard with nice ergonomic layout (and a nice full size keyboard layout with number pad) Love how they managed to squeeze in an  ethernet port at this price point. Slim sleek design and despite it being plastic it looks premium with the finish. I like how there's USB ports on 2 sides (hate it when USB ports are bunched together). The boot time is nice and I like the capacity of the SSD at this price point though 256GB would be generous (I stored stuff in cloud so not as big of a deal as you'd think). Camera is pretty good I use it in Zoom meetings and it does the job. Big track pad for mouse with lots of real estate to move your fingers on and I like the pinch feature.\n",

      "This Laptop is fantastic for what I paid for it.  I must say first, however, that I haven't even tried booting it up with the stock 4gb of ram installed. 4gb sounds like enough, but this Laptop uses up 2 of those 4gbs for the on board graphics. That leaves you with a pitiful 2gb. That’s simply not enough for Windows 10 in 2020. I installed an extra 4gb stick (which was quite cheap) leaving me with 6gb of usable ram, and its been very snappy. It does everything I wanted it to do and more. HD video steaming? No problem. Game streaming? You bet. It even streams 4K movies without any trouble.As for gaming? Well, I tried The Sims 4 out of curiosity, and guess what. It works pretty good at medium/high settings! Very nice, though it does get quite hot during gameplay. Now would I get this for my primary gaming rig? Heck no. But if you’re okay with older or low intensity games, it does the job.\n",

It can handle older games pretty well and emulators or course, but that's not the purpose. The screen is extremely nice, better than almost al; screens in this price point and nicer than some gaming laptops. The IPS is bright, color accuracy is fantastic, and blacks look black. The design is light and compact. The screen size feels nice and large without being too big for most laptop bags. The keyboard is very nice to use and easy to type on. The Ryzen 3 chip handles everything I've thrown at it. Original has Windows 10 S on it, which is rather useless. You can go to the Store and change option to Home, but it was easier to do a fresh install of Windows 10 Home and clean up the extra partitions. Had to enable BIOS password first to turn off secure boot to boot from USB, for anyone wondering.PROS:\n",

Now I'm not a heavy gamer, don't download a lot of programs, but do rely on the internet and have downloaded games like WordPlay and Solitaire. The screen is very clear and clean. i love the back lit keyboard. The keyboard also has a nice touch, not too hard and not too soft. Just right.  The internet comes right up and anything I open comes right up too. I am not used to Microsoft Edge and the start page with it's news and ads are annoying.  However it's not a deal breaker and I understand the security is better.  All in all, I do recommend this laptop for it's price, efficiency, super clear screen, and the back-lit keyboard. I'm very happy with it.August 2020 - I'm having to update my review and reduce my rating because 45 days after I received the Acer the backlit keyboard stopped working.  It was a very nice feature and I was very disappointed when it failed.  Of course it waited to fail until after the 30 day return period.\n",

      "The sound thru the \"realtec\" speakers was never loud enough to hear if not positioned right on the laptop. Through headphone the sound is fine. (on laptop you have to turn it up 10 100% to hear and it is not that loud, on headphones 50% will be loud enough). This was an issue from day one and I did not call it in until day 90 when another issue developed. The plastic frame around the screen  buckled, bowed and unsnapped (it is a two pc plastic frame front and back a that snaps together around the screen, and may be glued together but not molded together. It is flimsy and low quality and not durable. My laptop stayed in one place on my desk and has not been portable, this laptop would not survive if you tried to make it a portable one. Working with tech support (which was overseas and a hassle) the speaker workaround was attempted and may have improved the sound volume a bit, but still not as good as our HP laptop. For the plastic screen, I could at my cost mail it back to ACER and they would fix it , and it may be at a cost to me if determined not to be their defect, and my damage, that is understood as I did not damage it) but that I would be without it for up to 3 weeks. Their warranty is 30 days. So consider what ever you pay for this laptop that it is going to be a disposable computer, a 30 day use product as that is all that ACER will stand behind their products. I was lucky as mine lasted 3 months, (well without full sound that is). I would NOT recommend any ACER product due to this one ACER purchase.\n",

      "I bought this laptop as a replacement for my old Toshiba laptop from 2012. The Toshiba one was starting to show its age by failing to pass POST and thus failing to boot. I had used it almost every single day since 2012 after all, as it was my college laptop and even helped me launch my career as an engineer, so it has served me well. But the OS failures were getting troublesome. They were happening increasingly often, so I decided before all my data was lost (which wasn't really that much, since I keep all my actually important data on a home file server), I decided to shop around for a nice, reliable, not-too-cheap laptop I could use to replace it, and this is the one I chose to buy.For the non-Linux enthusiasts, feel free to skip this paragraph, but a kernel panic is basically the Windows blue screen of death equivalent on Linux. My old Toshiba was having kernel panics all the time starting with Kernel 5, so I thought maybe it was my old hardware which has having trouble with the brand new kernel. I tried an LTS version of Kernel 4.19, thinking it was going to solve my kernel panic issue, but nope. I still had kernel panics all the time, and it was starting to get worrying how often it was happening (multiple times a day near the time I got this new Acer laptop). So I feel like I got the new Acer laptop just in time before the Toshiba hardware became unbootable. Now, I'm an electrical engineer, but I'm a lazy engineer. I didn't feel like dissecting the Toshiba to try and pinpoint what the problem might have been. I use Arch btw (best meme 2k19)\n",

      "Great laptop at this price point. What makes this such a good value is Acer makes several versions of this. You can spend a lot more depending on your intended use but if that use is more basic you still get the good candy, so to speak. Same sleek design, very good screen, same materials and build quality, and all the latest tech inside along with Windows 10 Home once you switch out of S Mode.If your laptop is four or five years old like my old one you're in for a treat. Everything about this one is better than my old. It's lighter, quieter, sleeker, runs cooler, and the screen is leaps and bounds better. The keyboard feels quality, back lit, and you won't disturb anyone while typing as its very quiet in use. No more clacking!\n",

I wish the keyboard layout was a bit different with larger arrow keys but that is just a minor thing. The screen is really gorgeous, with large viewing angles and really black blacks. Battery life seems pretty good. One thing that surprised me on this laptop was the graphics. I wasn't expecting much but I installed Counterstrike Source and did a quick test and it gets over 100fps in 1080p. I did not try any new games but just the fact it can play even older 3d games alone is a nice bonus to me. I've ordered the 4gb extra ddr to get a performance boost, that should be the first thing done to this laptop, after turning off windows S mode and uninstalling bloatware. I installed an old 250gb SSD into the empty bay. Wow that \"cable\" is tiny and thin but it works.  Also they don't provide tiny screws to mount that SSD,so I just ended up taping mine in..but it worked fine. You will quickly run out of storage if you do not add another sata SSD or replace the NVMe ssd.Speakers do kind of suck. Volume is too low. I almost feel as though I could probably upgrade them myself if I really wanted to, though haven't tried yet.\n",

The specifications were hard to beat and so when everything was up and running I was happy. A day or two later one of the laptops had problems - we called Amazon who in turn tried to get us in touch with Acer to no avail. Amazon approved the return and we received a replacement. Soon both (1 of the original and the replacement) had hardware issues and we returned them all. Be warned - I am an IT professional with 20+ years - the allure of good specs, low price = you better make sure you have a plan to have it repaired or be able to return it.

The IPS screen looks amazing and you won't find 1080p at this price with any other brand. The keyboard feels nice. I have yet to try gaming on it ... have a $3000 gaming desktop for that. Windows is snappy. Just make sure and disable Windows S or you will be stuck with their apps only.

It comes with Windows S which can be switched to a full Windows Home Edition. The load times are ridiculously fast. Once you configure the laptop, even after shut down, it will take less then 10 seconds to boot to the login screen. The Wifi is already great. Battery life is great.

The reason I appreciate that is because in the past hour, at the time of me writing this review, I have had to reboot this thing twice because it froze on Chrome YouTube videos.

I am in the process of contesting it to clear up what they would do. You cannot use Chrome or 3rd party applications with S mode and this should be kids only.

      "My laptop died the first week of COVID lockdown.  Try to get anyone anywhere to replace it was futile. The delivery times on Amazon were insane and there was NO ANSWER at HP, IBM, Dell etc.  Best Buy was shuttered and no one was responding to website or phone inquiries. I HAD to order a machine that would come within a week. This was just about the only one.Right off the bat, the headphone jack didn't work and the audio was so low.  The speakers are horrible. Within a few weeks (maybe 3), the trackpad stopped working. I had a wireless mouse but the bluetooth would not recognize it so I had to use a USB mouse. About a month later, the keyboard had issues - like the shift key didn't work. The only way to get an uppercase letter was to hit capslock, type the letter, take capslock off again. Very inconvenient so I ordered a USB keyboard knowing that bluetooth would be useless.  Then I started to get \"no bootable device available\" messages upon startup...a sign that the hard drive is going. It's less than 4 months old and it's basically trash. I am trying to order another laptop but Acer will NOT be the brand.\n",

      "Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop, 15.6 inches Full HD IPS Display, AMD Ryzen 3 3200U, Vega 3 Graphics, 4GB.First off, I am not using this for gaming. I needed a new laptop for browsing the web, watching video clips; youtube, hockey highlights, movies sometimes (not often) and for Word, Excel and that sort of stuff. I did install 4GB of additional RAM (Samsung which was recommended), to get me to 8 GB of RAM.\n",

It seemed to fit my work needs though, which was what I primarily needed it for, and it wasn't going to cost a thousand dollars.\n",

      "I was expecting a delay but gladly they made it on time. The product is super smooth and well packed. The specifications of the product has meet my expectation and it was a fantastic brand. I would highly recommend this laptop as it an example of best buy.As far as the functionality is concerned, it has provided a fast and high quality of services and it really fit the budget even if I'm from Philippines but the product really exceeds the price. I can say that when you buy this laptop, you will surely love to buy again of the same kind. Thanks Amazon for my first experience buying in your platform. You've done a great job!\n",

      "I didn't expect much from this laptop - considering its price, it would be unrealistic. But one of the criteria to make a final decision when buying this particular item, was a battery life - it was promised at least 8 hr of off-wire. Ok, in the very beginning it would stay on for 7.5 hr (I checked), but 4 months passed and - it barely stays 3 hr or less. Also, when the laptop is on, the bottom part in the upper middle heats up too much - I guess it is where the battery is located.\n",

      "The quality of this laptop is top notch. The screen is a nice size. There are a copule things that bother me however. The sound is not very loud and sometimes the CPU is slow to respond. The quality of the sound is good though and the CPU does respond quickly most of the time so I can't really fault the machine too much. I really love the how thin and sleek the machine itself is. One thing I would have liked is to have a Blu Ray reader for my old BluRay and DVDs.\n",

      "I was so psyched to buy this computer and just as disappointed when I got it. New computers always take time to set up granted, I had a lot of trouble with this one. It could be because I haven't had a computer computer in five years but things shouldn't have changed that much. I had thought it came with an anti-virus and anti spyware and all that stuff apparently it comes with a window defender? But that did not stop a fake security scam from attacking me within the first 3 hours of setup? They froze my computer and told me I had to call a number so they could tell me how to fix it claiming to work for Windows / Microsoft? The dude wanted me to spend $500 for the next year to keep anyone else from doing that hacking into my computer. It was quite a scam and it took me three or four weeks to straighten it out and change all my bank information and every other thing because I didn't know the extent to which they hacked into my computer. Found out that my internet comes with a Norton security suite so I called them up and they help me to install it and even in that case for the next week or two I was still getting warnings at least from the Norton sweet that someone was trying to HACK in again and kept identifying it's the same fake security scam.I had no choice but I had to stop using it and I rarely use it because I'm afraid to do that I don't want to be hacked.The computer came already loaded I think it's called s mode but I didn't know how to use that so I got rid of that and quite frankly to try to maneuver around without pop ups who knows what else is going on I'm uncomfortable using it I don't think this is a particularly good by even though it didn't cost the whole lot I think computers need to just evolve into better tablets or something different like that I never buy a laptop again ever. I was so excited but now I'm so sorry.\n",

      "Don't worry, there is a fix for that.  I immediately removed the stock M.2 SSD for a 500GB M.2 SSD.  I installed an older Windows 10 build from a Windows thumb drive I got in 2015 which I think was build 10240.  The end resulted in the trackpad not working.  Couldn't even run Windows Updates.  After doing some google searching, I upgraded my system to build 10586 and the trackpad is working now.Update 12/26/2019 - Good for streaming videos, browsing the internet, downloading files.  Don't even think about downloading Steam and attempt to play a game with low system requirements.  It's going to still over heat your system and cause it to shutdown all of a sudden.  If you must play something, you may be better suited to download an emulator for a gameboy or something similar and play a rom.  So far so good with a gameboy advance emulator playing Pokemon Leaf Green.\n",

Decent priced laptop with a beautiful FULL HD screen, everything checked out good on benchmarking especially graphics as this has its own dedicated chip for graphics, unlike the integrated 630's you see, which do not do much, as in there is no video editing etc, but with this one, shes all good!\n",

Installation done easily from youtube for someone who never opened a laptop before in my life. Able to add more HDD/SSD? Yes. Added another SSD on the SATA/HDD slot. Now my laptop has more RAM and disk space. It was already fast from the start but adding more disk space is necessary i feel, 128gb just doesnt cut it. SLEEK design, 15.6” screen but able to fit into 14” laptop case. Small power brick. Backlight keyboard. Long battery life (in-built).Has all you need. For gaming, the graphics card is not the best so i dont recommend it for serious gaming but for normal gaming with lesser loads it works like a charm.

Suddenly with no mishaps, the power would not come on.

She then passed me to Acer support and I could barely understand him! After walking me through the \"same\" windows 10 fix (useless) He had me \"reset the computer\" And Still No Touchpad Fix,  Amazon offered me \"Return for replacement\"....a 30day deadline to return the bad one!  Fingers crossed, I want to give this laptop back 5 stars.Update: 4/5/20 The 2nd lap top sent to replace the first one with the bad touchpad, stopped working after 12 weeks!

I definitely use it also for YouTube streaming and some internet stuff. It's really good! I switched to Windows 10 Home edition immediately.  The laptop is really light for being 15\" honestly, I can carry it around in my backpack and can't tell the difference if I don't have it in my bag.  Really like the backlit keyboard as well. The system is fast enough, and can handle a few tasks at once without slowing down, and that's really all I need! I am keeping in mind that I can upgrade my hard drive and RAM someday when things start to slow down, and if I start to require heavier usage out of this laptop. But, I'm very happy with the price point and quality, and glad I have the choice to upgrade features in the future.\n",

I love the way the keyboard feels and having the number pad is a plus. If you are prone to getting frustrated easily, are computer illiterate, and feel you can't pick up very basic computer tasks with the help of youtube and other tutorials then this might not be the lap top for you. I just got hacked on my previous computer, and so I'm actually appreciating the S mode for a few months, but I can tell it's very easy to remove - again, if you're willing to take five minutes to figure it out. Supposedly memory can be added easily - using YouTube university and a screwdriver. I find it very fast, the screen is crystal clear, and it has so far been able to handle any task I've thrown at it. I do not consider myself very computer literate, so another plus to this machine is that it's helped to push me out of my comfort zone and into understanding laptops better while I streamline startup and other functions, and understand workings through the limitations of the 'S' setup. Sleek, sturdy, straightforward...feels like I should have paid a lot more. Only reason I can't give it five start is because I'm still getting used to the mouse pad placement and I can't help but compare it to higher end, much more expensive machines.\n",

It doesn't have a card reader or DVD reader but I don't use them that much on my other laptop anyway. So no great loss to me.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the volume is really low. I have it turned all the way up and it is still had to hear a video. I will be buying an alternate sound system to use. I did get the package with the mouse and extra memory.  Oh you will need to download the manual since one doesn't come with it. Make sure to put the manual on another device in case this computer should go down for any reason. The only gaming I do is a game on FB and it works great for that. Over all it's a great little computer. A great buy.\n",

      "I was looking for a low-cost computer for linux use.  This model was appealing because (1) it has a 1080p display, and most cheap laptops still have 768 line displays; and (2) it uses a decent Ryzen CPU, which is pretty fast and low-power compared to some Celeron CPUs you still see out there.I purchased this Acer and also also a 500GB SSD.  It was easy to install the SSD following a youtube video.  Opening and closing the case was a pretty smooth operation.  Everything went smooth.  Ubuntu 18.04 installed flawlessly.  Many times, when installing linux, there are issues with sound drivers or trackpad drivers, but everything worked great right out of the chute.  However, the HDMI out port was not active.  I did not spend any effort trying to get that to work.\n",

      "This laptop is light and sleek with an elegant, appealing design. I find its performance impressive because of the speed with which it accesses information on the web, email, and documents. For a device with specifications that seem basic, it does a superb job. Pictures and videos are full and rich and do justice to its advertised “Full HD (1920 x 1080) Widescreen LED-backlit IPS Display” The computer does not have a touchscreen and that works perfectly for me.I found that its battery runs for nearly ten hours on full charge during routine use.

Two were HP's and the sound absolutely died and were unfixable and since I watch a lot of painting tutorials I needed one that had decent sound.  Well, this one has lousy sound!  My hearing is not all that good, but at least it has sound, even though it is very weak and it is pretty loud with an external speaker that I stole from my husband.  It seems no laptop under $700. has good sound and now I understand that,  I'll just use a good external speaker from now on.  As for the rest of the computer, it's just great!  It's quick and I love the backlit keyboard, which is rare to find at this price point and a feature I wanted.  All around, now that I easily disabled the dreaded Windows 10 S, it does the trick just fine for me.  The picture is really nice as is the slim design and overall looks of it.  I am a 70 year old woman who also owns an ipad and an AIO 23\" desktop, both of which I use all the time, so this laptop is not my primary computer just a convenience.

Watching videos, web browsing, emails, office work, and even light gaming (non AAA titles obviously) this laptop does very well. The screen isn't super bright but is more than enough for basic tasks and the speakers are adequate. There are a few things that I want to point out and they're as followed:\n",
      "\n",
      "Had to see what all the hype was about when this puppy went on sale for Black Friday, and being a big AMD laptop fan, gave it a spin. The screen on this thing is by far the most impressive feature, I was really surprised at how well it looked and how crisp it was. Sure you can get particular about nits and brightness but using this indoors like most people you will be fine. Performance was as expected, ran some low spec games no throttling or slow down at all. Ram was easy to upgrade, it was something like 6 screws and the back plate came right off. Like how the top is aluminum, looks and feels premium. Only big drawback are the speakers, they are bottom firing which will be into your legs if it's on your lap and far too quiet if on a desk which is a bummer because otherwise this laptop is amazing for the price. It seems like a ridiculous cost cutting feature that the bean counters in corporate came up with. Still I've recommended this laptop to friends and coworkers when looking for a decent machine due to features, performance and upgrade ability. Acer has always been a reliable brand for me. Cheers.\n",

      "When shopping for a laptop, there are a lot of options and I usually tell people who ask for my advice to try and get the best you can afford...meaning, try not to cheap out on this kind of equipment if you can help it because in the long run, you'll find there's better satisfaction and enjoyment when your computer can handle whatever you end up using it for. That said, tech heads like me have a thing for diamonds in the rough and seeing what kind of performance we can squeeze out of a machine. Acer has one of the better line ups of affordable laptops with a system for all kinds of budgets and Aspire 5 with Ryzen and Vega 3 is at the very bottom of their entry level devices. I'll go straight to the point here, at the retail price of $350 you are mostly getting a nice display. The rest is probably going to be unacceptable to anyone looking for a decent level of performance to do...well mostly anything. It's not going to run video editing, video capture, or higher end games well, if at all. You don't want this as your Media Creation device as it just doesn't have enough power to handle that kind of stuff. Word processing, spreadsheets, Internet browsing, and youtube videos/TV streaming are what this laptop is mainly geared for. The only way you're really going to open up the possibilities for this laptop is to, as other reviews suggest, get out of Windows S mode, and invest in adding more RAM and installing a second 2.5\" SSD. All of these things can be done fairly easily by most people and Acer even has videos online that show you how to handle the hardware part. I ended up spending an additional $120 for 2 sticks of 8 gb RAM and a 1tb SSD so my total cost (after Black Friday deal) was just under $380. For not much more money than many Chromebook models (yuck), I got a solid travel laptop with Windows 10 that I can use as a secondary computer and not worry that I spent a ton of money on.  You can even play games on this thing--provided you install the dedicated graphics drivers from AMD (called Adrenaline). I was able to get Red Dead Redemption Online running, albeit not particularly well. But that the game runs at all is kind of amazing considering even high end PCs have had problems with it. Overall, I can see why this is a top seller on Amazon, but in the end, if you want an \"out of the box\" experience that just gets you up and running quickly, you should really look at upping your budget. If you want a backup laptop for travelling, and are willing to put in a bit more money and time into getting the performance up to speed (literally), then this is probably best laptop value on Amazon right now.\n",

      "\n",
      "Owned this laptop for two months before the screen died. Acer said that fixing the screen was an out-of-warranty repair, despite the fact that the laptop was never once dropped or had any damage done to it by me (probably to get out of having to eat the cost of the repair). To have them repair it out of warranty would have cost more than the price of just buying a new laptop, so now it is junk. A complete waste of money.\n",

      "Underpowered.  Sticky keys. Unpredictable touch pad.  It doesn’t have a touch screen, so I don’t know why I was asked to rate that.  I didn’t buy it for gaming, but I already knew it wouldn’t be good for that anyway.  I only ended up using it for checking email, basic word processing, and web browsing for 6 months (re-imaging it twice) before I gave up on it and bought an HP touch screen instead, which had a much more vivid display and better processor.  When I decided to buy a better alternative, someone offered to buy it from me so their 2nd-grader could do the remote school thing during the Corona virus pandemic.  I couldn’t do that with a clear conscience because I wouldn’t want a kid or parent having to mess with its unreliability.  I advised them to get a Chromebook instead.  This Acer is essentially a brick holding down papers on my credenza at this point.For the price point, I should not be surprised, but I’m justified in feeling disappointed, IMO.\n",

      "I have had my new computer for about a week now and am really pleased with this selection. It is fast and sharp. Thanks to the multitude of previous reviewers, I was immediately able to disable Windows S and converted to Window Home.  As a senior citizen with a ten year old Dell, I was a little apprehensive about  the startup but it was very easy and I have installed several apps without difficulty.  It is certainly annoying to get the popups on my old excel and word office documents trying to get me to purchase Office 365 but I am going to use the free Office Trio.  I do not game so cannot address that but for my purposes and at this price point, it is  a very good value .\n",

      "Absolutely love this laptop so far. It starts up super quick, probably 5 or 10 seconds from when you push the power key. The screen has good graphics. I’m not a gamer but i am a photographer and graphic designer, so the graphics are very important. The setup was very easy. It was no problem at all to switch from S mode to regular Windows 10. The screen is nice and large. And I love the number pad at the right. Most laptops don’t have that. The keyboard only lights up for a little bit unless you are actively typing. I know it bothers some but i understand the point of it, if you are watching a movie it’s nice to not have anything else lit up. If you want it to light up again, just hit any key. We got this on Prime Day so it was an even better price than it’s normal price, but even the normal price is great for this computers features. It comes with Cortana which helps you set it up, but you can always turn her off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got it on sale on Prime Day, so to go with it I bought a 16GB ram kit and a 240GB SSD hard drive.  Without those upgrades it would probably be ok for office tasks and minimal web browsing.  For the price and even after upgrading the ram and hard drive I think it's well worth it for the money.  You can step up in price for the laptop but will not have that much ram.  The NVMe drive seems quick and now that I have the additional hard drive I don't have to worry about space.  The install of parts wasn't to bad.  Take out all the screws on the bottom, peal apart and install parts.  Separating the bottom was a little difficult, very well fit, so if you're hesitant in computer work, ask for help.  It took some finesse.  It almost feels like you'll break something so just go slow.  Back to the laptop.The screen is very good.  No problems with brightness and angles.  The speakers are ok, but then again this is a cheap laptop.  They're definitely better than some others I had but just keep a set of earbuds with it and you'll be fine.  Plus no one wants to listen to what you want, so just plug in for everyone's sake.  The battery life is ok.  I might be able to get about 6 hours out of it.  Haven't done a full test yet, only have used it for about 2 hours at a time.  Just over 2 hours of online use is dropping it to about 60%.\n",

      "I don't have much to say on all the detail about gigs and speed. I dont understand why anyone would not upgrade from Windows 10S. It was free for me to upgrade. I got it because I use Zoom a lot for meetings and the computer format is better than tablet/phone format. Visually it works really well for that. My only complaint is the speaker location. The two speakers are located on the bottom front lip. When trying to use Zoom I can't always hear what people are saying (their microphones arent good/loud enough) even if my volume is at 95%.\n",

      "This computer works great, especially for the price. I am not using it for gaming. I am a small business owner and needed a reliable laptop just for accessing email and Google online documents/drive etc. Just received and just started using, but so far so good.Regarding S Mode: This can easily be turned off and there is no cost to do so - but must be done CORRECTLY. Just follow the link in the Q&A section on the Amazon product page. IMPORTANT, if you don't do it correctly you will have to purchase a new OS and can't go back without doing so.\n",

The speakers are alright, but I don't mind since I use my Bluetooth headphones with it. The back of the screen is metal, but the rest is plastic, which is fine for the price. This laptop has a snappy processor and Vega graphics, but I wouldn't recommend for hardcore gaming (maybe some light gaming). Also, I recommend you add another stick of ram, since just opening Chrome and running other applications, uses a lot of memory (I added a PNY 4gb stick). It's easy to remove the screws, but be careful removing the panel since it's plastic and some tabs might break. Trackpad is responsive and has a left/right click. Camera is alright, but most laptop cameras are the same.Pros:\n",

      "I don't game on my laptop and only need it for writing and general internet use. It's perfect in that capacity. I had another Acer before and the screen quality on this model is a huge improvement. I can't speak to the longevity yet, although this is a concern because my other Acer only lasted a couple years, and I am not particularly hard on my electronics. (I still use the iPod I bought in 2007 and I've never broken a phone.) This model is also much slimmer and lighter, which I love. I wish I had this version before I graduated so I didn't have to lug my other huge one to class--especially once it ended up taped together for an entire semester and the bar exam! I also love the backlit keyboard. I use it a lot at night and it makes that a lot easier. My only two complaints are that the bottom left corner of the mousepad is a bit soft when left clicking on it and I pretty much always have to have the sound at full volume. If anything I'm listening to is quiet, I often struggle to hear it. The quality of sound itself is good, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all I want to say that a lot of the reviews and answered questions are talking about different model numbers, not the A151-43-R19L. They talk about how a sata drive can be used to add memory, which is not true. This computer does have a sata drive slot, but for some reason it can not support it. I know this because I first bought a sata drive and it didn't work. I called the hard drive manufacture and Acer. Both of which were not a lot of help and did not know most of the questions I was asking. This is an Acer Aspire 5 . There is a lot of different models of this. For example, there is an intel and an AMD version. Please make sure you know what model you have. When you search for hard drives, make sure you put the entire model and not just Acer A151.The only way to add memory that I found to work is to replace the original NVMe PCIe that the computer comes with. In order to install this you will need to reinstall windows because this hard drive will replace the one that comes with the computer. Look up Youtube videos on how to do this. It is better to not download anything to the computer like microsoft office before doing this, because you might not be able to download it again without having to purchase the download again.\n",

      "I was very excited by this laptop, as I haven't had one with a bigger screen in quite a while (and have never had one with a backlit keyboard; fancy!). It was pretty easy to set up and I was pretty quickly doing work and playing Fallout New Vegas.HOWEVER, I ended up returning it. The biggest issue for me was that red colors look slightly orange. I compared it to a couple of other screens and it was undeniable (although the Acer tech support people did indeed deny there was anything wrong).

      "Love the display, hdmi out, backlit kybd, mini number pad & yes, even the touchpad.  Miss having an optical drive, but I'll get over that.  Switching out of \"S\" mode was a cinch.  Great performance web surfing.  I do wish it had a stereo audio in jack and visual indicators for Caps Lock & Num Lock.  Windows provides screen notifications for wifi radio status & audio mute.  My main gripe however, is how the heck are you supposed to open the thing?  I must be missing something because the only way I see is to catch the edge of the aluminum top (screen) cover, which just barely protrudes past the base.I think the squishy touchpad many are complaining about is actually very nice & the squishiness is actually BUTTONS hidden in the lower edge. So if you like the buttons, they're there & if you don't, you can use taps instead.\n",

I turned the touchpad off as it just makes me touch it inadverntently as I use a wireless mouse.  Excellent value and is quite fast with the $24 extra 4 gb of ram I added to it as well.

As a daily driver for any other tasks, it’s a fantastic choice.The screen is far superior to anything else you’ll find in this price range as it’s not only 1080p but the viewing angles are wide and the quality of the picture is great. The backlit keyboard is possibly the only one of its kind in this price range. It’s pretty big, and because of this they even manage to fit a small numpad into the keyboard layout which is practically unheard of when it comes to notebooks. The chassis is mostly metal (aluminum?) which is durable, more likely to dent than break, and provides some function as a heat sink. The bottom is plastic, but it’s well-ventilated.\n",

For the most part that worked but because some items needed to be submitted via Google Classroom we came across some formatting issues.  Knowing that the new school year is mostly remote (and I prepare for full remote this winter), it was time to upgrade her to a real computer. I looked at Chromebook based laptops, and while they would be quite compatible with her school work I didn't find the pricing on these items any better when you got to upgrading for gaming and storage.This led me to Acer- my home desktop purchased 7 years ago is still up and running with more than enough storage and good speed- it was a no brainer.  The price point is competitive, the graphics/screen is great. My daughter is attached to this thing so I haven't been able to use it myself other than the set up. If you are wondering about what size laptop would work best for you- this 15.6 inch screen feels bigger than I was expecting! I use a high end 13 inch Dell laptop for work and this Acer seems just as good with a bigger screen and has a numeric keypad that I personally find essential! I expect that this device will last for years to come if it is still made with the same quality my Acer desktop.\n",

For starters, Acer seemed to have wanted to be creative by changing how the function keys appropriate which makes it an odd learning curve. No more F5 to refresh or the use of the Fn at all for that matter. For a new laptop, it's incredibly slow. And I've already gotten the blue screen of death even after installing antivirus protection and using it to write in Word and online clothes shop a few times upon its arrival.

I wanted to email ACER customer support, but discover that they do not have any email for customer support (check it yourself).  They do have some support web pages with no human behind.  I was able to enter a chat where I reported that they sold me a defective laptop and wanted it replaced, but they refused (they wanted me to pack it, return it to them, wait for them to get it, wait for them to repair it, and wait to get it back).  I would go through a hassle like that to get it replaced, but not to get it repair (they should not had a sold a defective product).

Compared to my 10-yr old HP laptop it is screaming fast booting up and cruising the internet.  I don’t do gaming and I’m told this would not be a good choice for that.  I immediately turned off the S-mode, which is a scam anyway, and bought my software on EBay for pennies on the dollar.  For example, 3 years of ESET virus protection for $21.  Microsoft Office was super cheap too, but you have to turn off S-mode to add software on your own.  Great screen, good sound, very fast response, at a great price.\n",

The ever helpful decided that I wanted to download drivers for my Aspire 5. Well, I thought I needed to be a bit firmer with HAL and told him that I really, really wanted to chat with a real live human being if such a person even exists at Acer.

The computer was fine in terms of performance -- except for two problems I had from the start:  1)  The fan kept coming on and the computer's plugged in cord pack (not sure what it's called) would get really hot.  Never had this problem with new laptop before.  2)  I'd be typing with two hands -- and all of a suddenly that little glove pointer hand would appear and move all over the bottom of the screen, and what I was typing would become incorrect.  I called Acer and they had me ship the computer to them for repairs.  It took a week to get to them.  I followed up after they got it to ask how long repairs might take.  Told up to 20 business days. Ok.  Then a little over a week late I get an unexpected UPS delivery -- Acer had returned the computer to me.  I tried it -- same two problems, still there.

It's plenty bright. The numeric pad is weird, but its like anything else. Once you adjust to it, you're fine. The keyboard doesn't stay lit, but I figure that's to conserve battery life so I'm okay with that. The keys are lifted a bit which I (as a gamer who loves their mechanical keyboard) appreciate. It's fast as well and all around perfect for a student. I bought the extra RAM, but haven't put it in yet. I did exit the safe-mode version of windows because I think it's stupid but that's me.

      "This is a Christmas gift for my child and I've been playing around with it for a couple of weeks to get everything the way I want (changing terrible Windows 10 default settings, installing parental control software, cleaning up start menu, removing bloatware, etc).  I consider myself an \"advanced basic\" user as I don't work in tech but I've built a couple of rigs and usually upgrade and replace components in my own PCs.  Anyhow, bought this with the intention of making the following changes (so my review is based on the laptop in this configuration): swap S-mode for regular Windows 10 (free and easy but irreversible), install an additional 4 gigs of RAM for a total of 8 installed, tweak settings as mentioned before.Almost everything about this machine is amazing, and for the price I don't believe a better deal can be had.  It puts my husband's budget laptop to shame.  The SSD is quiet and smooth, the monitor display is beautiful, it can stream and handle basic tasks without any lag at all, and the ports are totally sufficient.  The keys feel excellent (plus backlighting!), the brushed aluminum case top looks very stylish, and the speakers are totally sufficient for a laptop (if you want great sound quality use headphones).  The AMD Ryzen processors are very good and this will typically outperform the slightly higher priced model with the Intel i3.  Windows 10 is Windows 10, but it's better than S-mode.

However, one must unscrew the little connector for the hdd, and take off the little ribbon cable that is under the plastic. This little piece connects to the hdd/or ssd and the motherboard. I think someone showed a video of that connector here.Furthermore it has an extra ram slot, and another 4gb of ram is available on amazon for about 21 dollars, which I believe is worth it. The bios however, does not have many options. I could not find any to create a xmp for the ram. The battery life is strange, as my laptop says it only has about 3 hour on full charge, but I recall it saying at one point it had 5? so I don't know whats going on there.

It's a real pain to rip the back off to upgrade RAM and storage but it was possible with some effort. I really do recommend at least getting extra RAM, it takes the experience from passable yet laggy to completely smooth. I'm deducting a star because my major complaint about this laptop is its poor cooling. The fans can get loud and it can overheat itself. The bottom is like a grill at times. Now obviously, the specs are as listed and you aren't going to run demanding games on this. The newer generation of chip sets, however, do make an adequate effort on lower settings in some games. Look up how to get it out of Windows S mode or whatever it was called into a standard copy of Windows 10, it's legal and just a one time annoyance (you do NOT want to stay on the restrictive S mode). The bloatware was relatively minimal. In conclusion, with some extra ram, this was a great value and it's been a trusted companion for school and work.\n",

Then it started to happen multiple times during a session.  I'm not a gamer and was taxing any of the design elements.  Still black screen, back on, black screen, repeatedly.  I returned the computer for another brand and model.  We'll have to see how it works out.\n",

      "My first order had a damaged exterior carton, so I did not accept it, worried that it might be damaged internally, the second one came the next day and was fine. I've had it 31 days and during that time the cursor operated by the touchpad was sensitive and stopped working all together. Fortunately, I had a \"mouse\" from another computer I had in my house, that was able to control it. However, by the time I realized this was a problem, my opportunity to return it had expired. After doing every test with Acer, they determined it had to be repaired and now I am waiting for them to send me the instructions to ship it back to them. I'll have to spend additional time doing this and then waiting to get it back. Not happy!\n",

      "The computer worked great for about 3 months then the mouse pad stopped working. Called customer support and searched videos to try and fix, but nothing worked. Now I have to pay to ship it back to see if they can fix it or get me another one. But inconvenience being without a computer - would not recommend.\n",

      "So far we are very pleased with the laptop and for it's price you can't beat it. Overall, if you are only doing basic things like surfing the web, some microsoft office stuff, and watching movies/videos you are good. The screen is beautiful, the backlight keyboard is a great feature, it has a 10 key section and I love the sleek design. There are a few drawbacks like others have mentioned, but it's not the end of the world for me.The cons I've noticed was it can run a little slow when opening programs, but I'd say once warmed up it goes pretty quick. The speakers are mediocre and I hope they can hang in there. Lastly, and this only matters if you nerd out on excel like me, that it's hard to maneuver using shortcuts because the home, end and some other buttons are on the 10 key section which makes you switch back and forth between number lock to use them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't believe how nice this laptop is for the low price.  I use it for my taxes, storing photos, email, reading the news, playing simple games.  Sorry, I am not a gamer so I can't attest to how it works for gaming.  The keys feel great while using. The only slightly negative comments are it does not have a nice grasp area to open with your thumb which might be a problem if you have large fingers.  I have very slender fingers so it is not terribly bad for me.  Also the touch pad reacts somewhat imprecisely so if you like using a touch pad you may not be happy or maybe you can adjust the touch in a way that works better for you.  I prefer using a mouse and keyboard so it is not a problem for me.  I really like that it has a 10-key on the right side and I like the thinness of the laptop because it makes typing more comfortable than my old laptop.  I would recommend this laptop for sure. Actually, I recommended it to someone today!\n",

I've had it for less than a week, and have upgraded the memory from 4GB to 16, and put in a 500GB Samsung SSD drive to compliment the one that's already in there.  The upgrades were very easy to do myself, just take your time with it and do it right - there are videos on youtube from Acer and others that show you just how to do it.  With the updates installed, and Windows \"S\" mode turned off, this laptop kicks ass!  Yes it's not the most powerful out there, but for this price you get a LOT of what you need without all the unnecessary bells and whistles.  The responsive backlit keyboard is really a joy to type on, and the trackpad accepts mulitouch gestures.  Really nice.  Would buy this again and recommend it to average users in a heartbeat.\n",

I'm going to go into the disturbingly large number of reasons why.If you're looking to game, turn around. I suppose it's good for small games, but I definitely don't see myself running Minecraft (Java Edition) on this without some big issues. Win10 version might work? Haven't tried it.

      "I primarily purchased this Acer Aspire 5 A515-43-19l for the purposes of playing with various Linux operating systems.  It is a low cost device and I was surprized by the features it offers for the money.  The AMD Ryzen 3 processor is not necessarily the fastest around, but it is certainly sufficient for most every day use and works well with Linux.  I decided on installing and running Manjaro Linux 19.03 on the notebook and have found that after disabling the Windows Fast Start and changing the BIOS in the notebook to allow the USB drive to be the primary boot drive that I was able to boot using the USB drive (created with Rufus) and install the Linux OS.  It is my opinion that this laptop performs much better with it's Ryzen CPU on Linux than on Windows 10 Home version 1903.  It appears that the CPU is less taxed and that memory usage is lower.Highly Recommended as a device for your student, an every day low cost notebook or  as a toy for you tinkerers out there.\n",

      "I'm 73 and retired, and needed to replace a broken laptop. I need a good screen, backlit keyboard, fast enough for streaming video, and basic word processing and home accounting. I don't do gaming. Perhaps most important was price, as I'm on a fixed income. This laptop met all of my needs, but I was concerned about the Windows \"S\" mode, as some reviews had difficulty removing it. However, through Microsoft's process, it removed easily, and now I download any programs I need. I LOVE this computer, and still can't believe I paid $349.99 total. I watch a lot of YouTube, and the streaming has been perfect, and the 15-inch screen a plus. I'm struggling to find a downside, but the backlit keyboard turning off after 30 seconds is inconvenient. But it easily turns on again by hitting any key (I use the spacebar). This laptop has met all my needs so far, and I recommend it highly. Thanks, ACER.\n",

I’m telling y’all if you play Sims 4, Roblox, Steam this is a great laptop for you! I’ve already installed 3 GB worth of cc on my Sims 4 and it still moves awesome and quickly and the graphics are AMAZING!!

I added 4GB of RAM (search \"Samsung 4GB DDR4 PC4-21300, 2666MHZ, 260 PIN SODIMM, 1.2V, CL 19 Laptop ram Memory Module\" here on Amazon) and used a Win7Pro old license to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. I also used the SATA SSD from her old PC to add more storage. The laptop works like a champ now for what is needed and my daughter is really happy with it. The screen is bright and clear, sound quality is OK for the occasional video watched without headphones, there is no lag when using any MS Office or other applications and WiFi is strong and stable. This machine is a really good deal and a great value, if you don't expect top notch gaming performance out of it.\n",

I've owned a lot of computers going back to my Apple II in I believe it was Aug 1978, and I've built several, so I know fast vs slow. This thing is amazingly slow. My desktop drive got corrupted and I bought this because I was too lazy to deal with fixing it. Now I'm going to have to fix it, or age ten years waiting for this thing to do something.6 months later...STILL TERRIBLE!!!!

It took longer than expected to ship/arrive since it was one day shipping but the laptop itself is extremely nice. It's sleek, looks great, runs pretty dang fast, and it seems to handle some of my less intensive games like The Sims 4 just fine. The sound quality is great and at first I had issues with the battery not lasting long but that was due to some preinstalled apps running in the background (I don't know which ones exactly, as I mass uninstalled whatever I didn't need so it's hard to tell which one was doing it.) All in all, it's a good laptop especially considering the price and I'm happy with it. Definitely recommend it for any fellow college students\n",

      "I bought this computer about 9 months ago and have had problems with it from the start. First, the screen would get semi-black for a few seconds at a time and the web browser would need to be refreshed. Now, the screen turns totally black several times a day for a few seconds each time (see video for example) and about once a day the computer totally freezes. The only way to get it unfrozen is to force shut down and reboot. Such a terrible computer. Will never buy an Acer product again. Update: I sent this computer in for repair and had to pay $26 in shipping for them to fix the faulty computer they sent me.Update: Just received my computer back after not having a computer for 11 days. They did not fix anything. Diagnosis says OS reloaded. Same problems. Mouse touchpad doesn't work. Screen goes black. Computer freezes. Acer said I can send back for another repair and luckily I don't have to pay to ship this time. LOL. I have reported them to the Better Business Bureau and am returning this laptop through amazon with a 20% restocking fee. So messed up for Amazon selling me a defective laptop but worth it to get rid of this pile of crap. WILL NEVER BUY ACER AGAIN! DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER!\n",

I turned it off which took about 3 seconds and downloaded Total AV, chrome, zoom, and protorio for school. computer is still really fast, and has 89 GB left of storage. 6.51 for app storage, and 158 MB for files left. I download everything to a flashdrive anyway incase my computer crashes ( like the last one) so space isn't what I needed. this is the best computer for the best price and is also upgradable according to my geek boyfriend and most other google reviews. hope this helps other college people stuck in the online world.\n",

      "This replaces an 8-10 year old laptop. Nice big huge screen. Very Fast. I did order the 8GB memory and replaced it.  About 8 screws to remove off bottom- see photo. It’s not too hard to do but it’s also not easy either. The bottom does not fall off. Be careful - you have to carefully pry open the bottom- you can break if you are not careful- start at one end and work your way down. The memory  sticks snap in place- not slide in place. If you download steam games you will have to switch out of Windows S. Very easy see pic of instructions. In the bottom left of your screen in the white “type here to search” box, type dxdiag and hit enter; this will show you your computer specs - memory, speed ...etc. I’ll probably get an external CD drive. Love it so far.\n",

Lightning fast and has a very \"premium\" look. I ordered this with 32GB RAM(I do heavy photoshop work, but 16GB is plenty for most people). The included M.2 SSD is insanely fast, but you'll also definitely want to pick up an additional SSD. Installing additional hardware is painless. You only need to remove 10 screws from the bottom and everything is laid out clear and easily accessible. This was definitely made with user upgrades in mind. Very consumer friendly design.\n",

I work with autistic kids so I needed a laptop that can stream zoom, multiple tabs and process things quickly without lagging and waiting forever for a video or a page to load like my old laptop did. The screen quality is superb. It’s crystal clear and I love it. My only cons for this laptop is one that was addressed In the reviews I read were the screen not being bright enough. Don’t get me wrong it’s bright and clear but just feels they cut it short on its potential. The other issue is the camera isn’t that great. My old laptop  has a better camera than this laptop does unfortunately. At least it came with one so I won’t knock it too much. Battery life is good at max brightness and running tabs it lasts 3.5-4 hours for me sometimes a little less but a small step up from what I had. It’s a beautiful laptop. I love it. I would definitely get it again if I needed another one.\n",

I upgraded the Samsung internal RAM memory to 8gb for about $25, I highly recommend doing this. Not crazy about the track pad being right of center instead of dead center, but I use it with a wireless mouse, so this is not an issue for me. Keyboard is well layed out and very responsive.  Screen quality is OK, but I wouldn’t recommend it for high octane gaming.\n",

One thing I don't care for is that the speakers aren't very loud at all.  I truly cannot hear them (course I am losing my hearing altogether) unless it is completely quiet in the room and even then I can barely make it out so I have used an ethernet cable and hooked it up to my tv to watch youtube videos or do business meetings where I need to be able to hear everything and that works just great if you have a smart tv it should have that option.

I did some tinkering with the sound drivers and managed to get it to play acceptably loud. So far it has held up fine and I've not felt like it was slow despite its limited ram. I mostly surf and do some blogging and the keyboard is pretty nice.I was worried I'd have to resort to a chrome book due to my budget but this unit has fit the bill for me. I still have some weird audio issues to track down, namely audio getting out of sync when using external speakers or Bluetooth, but I think that those are more issues with windows than this particular machine.\n",

Small annoyance but noticeable is the lack of signal on the keyboard when using caps lock. Just An OK laptop for business use. Absolutely love how light weight and slim it is though. But the best is undoubtedly the price... only $300 (Dec 2019) for a more than decent laptop, can't go wrong with that.\n",

It started with the screen blackening in and out while I'm in the middle of working or browsing webs. Come to find out this one had bad sensors when you open and close the laptop. And since I'm well past the return date - I have to chalk this up as a loss. Horrible quality laptop that I will not buy again.\n",

My last laptop struggled with some of the games I liked to play including Civilization 6, Rome 2 total war, and company of heroes 2. I don't know a lot about computers, but I know enough to tell you that obviously this is not a gaming laptop. It works okay for what I want, but I play all of these games on low to lowest settings. Don't expect it to run heavy games like these at high settings. I still have problems with slow troops in Rome 2 while I'm in big battles. It can at least run it though, which I'm fine with for now.I saw a comment that they really enjoyed the quick startup and I have to say I was not expecting to really care, but it's very nice. The SSD is pretty small though. If you're planning on playing games and downloading games you're going to want to install a HDD (there's a space for it) there is also a space for more RAM which is a nice option if you know what you're doing or have someone to install it for you.

I googled how to switch out of S mode and it took a minute to do that so I could install other apps not available in the Microsoft app store. I went ahead and paid the annual subscription to office and it comes with 1T of space on OneDrive so you can back up all your files there. The laptop does not come stock with a lot of memory so backing up is probably going to be necessary, that or upgrade the storage space. All in all for the price it can't be beat.\n",

Some reviewers were bashing this product saying if you want a full windows version you'll have to pay for it, which is not true. This system comes with Windows S mode running by default but as you do the initial start you can easily switch it to full windows 10.  Just do a simple Google search (or go to the microsoft windows support website) and you can learn how to do it in less than 30 seconds. This laptop is a steal for the price asked, backlit keyboard is very nice and bright, the image in the screen is very crispy, it is perfect. If anything changes I will update this review but so far we are very happy with it.\n",

Please note the laptop is not a touch screen computer even though some product descriptions says it is!  However the screen is fantastic.  Sharp and bright.  Much clearer than my 3 year old HP that cost more than double this price.  For $350 you are not going to get the fastest computer but it does amazing well for typing docs, surfing the internet etc.  Heavy use heats up the bottom of the computer beyond normal so take it easy. The WiFi has multiple antennas so it gets a much better signal when you are in weaker areas of your house.  The reviews complain about this or that but I say grow up and recognize what a great computer you are getting for almost nothing.  If you are doing intensive work like  using access with multiple sheets tied together with conditional formulas then forget this computer. If you type with your hands touching the touch pad then turn the touch-pad off and use a mouse.  If you need more memory buy one or two 128 GB sticks for $12  each . Why pay for internal memory at 10 times the cost??  Buy this one and be happy!\n",

In 7 to 10 days I will fail courses and risk my job. I have already lost a day's pay trying to deal with it. Save your money for something reliable.

In MS Word, this problem with text disappearing and cursor jumping around at will also happens.  Never had this problem with any laptop I've used before.

I play the sims 4 on here with no problem but will look to expand its storage because I want to add more games, overall great laptop. I am pleasantly satisfied.\n",

My main uses for the laptop are for streaming Netflix, internet browsing, and playing some free 3D online games (like Fortnite and Paladins). The screen is full high definition and looks very sharp. and the games run smoothly with the AMD Ryzen graphics card.My only negative about this machine is the standard computer speakers are downright terrible.

Very tight and needing some force to pull out usb sticks, something I am afraid to eventually break the ports for the long run.

I'm student and use it mostly for light PC gaming, shopping, video meetings, and documents, and it has yet to freeze or lag during any of these. My only issue was that after installing the first new Windows update, my touchpad was disabled out of nowhere for a reason even tech support couldn't figured out. Apparently it happens a lot with Aspires, but two days later the bug repaired itself. Outside of that one potential problem you could run into, this is thing is amazing!\n",

      "Before buying this computer I watched some reviews on YouTube, specifically for 3D benchmarks on the Vega 3 graphics. I was blown away by the quality that a few of the videos showed. I received the laptop, and I love it for browsing the web and watching movies. It will not play most 3d games well, it has a hard time with Age of Empires 2. Oddly, it will play World of Tanks like a beast but cannot handle Fishing Planet. The entire system is overtaxed, which is really disappointing.Now, that being said about the graphics card, I LOVE this computer because of it's memory expandability. The maximum capacity is huge, and with an additional hard drive slot you can get some serious storage in such a small package. The monitor is bright and crisp, perfect for watching HD movies. The wi-fi is fast and reliable, and I was able to stream content between my computer at home to a vacation rental in the Cayman Islands with no issues.\n",

The keyboard is decent and backlit. The trackpad is good and large, but the spacing tends to trigger accidental touches, at least or me.

Tried all the suggested remedies such as power option changes and bios updates. Even re-installed Windows and upgraded to the Pro version with no success to fix the  resume from wake issue. Would not recommend as unit fails simple basic requirement. What more serious flaw  may lie ahead. Returned unit for refund. Usually not this negative but this unit wasted to much of my time.\n",

I can't imagine actually using a computer with 4gb of ram in this day and age. Ram is inexpensive and it would be silly not to upgrade. I also switched off windows S immediately so no review about that either. Both of these upgrades were painless and quick.\n",

      "Guys I got a brand new Acer Aspire 5 Slim - What an amazing buy !!! Folks this laptop is amazing. I use to have a Intel i5 from 2017, this is far superior in any sense. I just added extra 8GB of Samsung ram DDR4 to boost his performance. The screen is amazing so bright and clear like cristal.  The 128GB SSD is an mVe so I have added another 500GB SSD (you can do it easily as the cable comes inside the laptop itself - you just remove the small board and plug SSD & CPU little cable that is clearly labeled for no mistake. Startup takes about 10 seconds !!!! Everything is fast to edit a photo, browse internet (I have installed Chrome and Firefox) and Edge works fast as well. I would suggest always to upgrade memory with another 4GB card (about US$17) but get Samsung the best choice. Keyboard is light and just that makes all the difference. I am kind of a mix user, use internet and Office software but sometime like to edit photos on Photoshop and edit videos on Adobe Premiere. It runs very well with no glitch seems like you are running the last generation i5. The secret of this laptop is an excelent CPU tied with a modern Ryzen GPU that makes everything \"talk\" on the same pace with no bottleneck on the way. So my conclusion is an amazing bargain for US$ 313 dolars on Amazon. Almost forgot the keyboard is excelent and has a numeric pad so works fantastic for any use and the weight is about 1,5Kg or about 3,7lbs lighttt. Very happy with all included. IThe screen is 1080P ready and watch movies is a sweet experience. The wifi is very fast ...I was positively impressed with the speed it provides since my last laptop condnd't keep a good donwload rate. This is FAST ! So enjoy and buy with confidence.\n",

I do use the online word because I am in online school and that’s what we get free, but still. It’s super frustrating because my previous computer did not type as slow. Could this be because I am using word online and not in the laptop version? Possibly...but it’s super frustrating that it’s occurring.Other than the lag when doing my homework (which is what I use it for most), I love the colors on the screen, the size and everything else about this thing!

And, I can’t seem to upgrade the license without turning it into a science project. Thanks, again Microsoft.  This is a nice piece of hardware for a very reasonable price.  One negative on the hardware. The sound system is deplorable. But then I paid $130 for this through various discounts.  Inch more than that and I’d rather buy a six year old Apple MacBook Air.\n",

      "We got this laptop as a cheap, yet snappy laptop for my grandfather. I was looking for something with an AMD processor, 4-8 gigabytes of RAM, an SSD, and a nice lightweight design. Without any doubt, this is that laptop. It's an amazing and slim laptop that will get you through usual everyday tasks without any problems. The SSD is amazing and makes the desktop experience multitudes better, even with a low end processor. While I would highly recommend upgrading from Windows 10S to full-fledged Windows, I left it on S mode because my grandfather doesn't need anything besides Microsoft Edge (which has gotten FAR better ever since the beta release that switched it to the open-source Chromium engine).Overall, this laptop exceeded my expectations for the price. It's incredible what you can get for such a cheap price point nowadays, and I highly believe it's due to AMD's budget and competitive processors and the falling prices of SSD's. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this laptop.\n",

Got this for $260 on Prime day hoping it would fill all these needs, and I am not disappointed. For this price having a 15.6\" IPS screen with a small bezel surface and backlit keyboard is unheard of. I have a gaming desktop that I use for the heavy lifting, but using this on the go or sitting in the back patio to catch up on the days news is wonderful. Web pages open quickly, keyboard is responsive. For this price, complaining about anything that it doesn't have is just a waste of time; I don't think you can find a better deal at this price, there are tablets that cost more than this with less specs.\n",

      "Last month I came across this product while searching for a budget laptop compatible with Ubuntu Linux. After looking at the answered questions it looked like it was a good fit for my needs. It comes with decent specs, but I was surprised to see it has the option to upgrade the RAM and HDD. I spent about another $80 on 16GB RAM and 500GB HDD, they are very easy to install if you have a little bit computer knowledge, I am sure a local computer store could install them as well very quickly. This product even with the upgrades is still hundreds of dollars less then other comparable laptops.This laptop does come with Windows S mode, I am not too familiar with it, but you can switch from S mode to normal windows without too much trouble. I installed Ubuntu 20.04 Linux as soon as it arrived. It installs quick and easy, no drivers are needed at all. With the added RAM and HDD I installed, this laptop performs very very well. Far beyond what I was expecting from it. It has good battery life, I get about 7-8hrs of battery life with screen brightness at half. If you are looking like I was for laptop that you can install Ubuntu or other Linux distros like Mint, etc.. this is a great choice, it's reasonably affordable, looks great, comes with decent performance, has options for upgrades if desired and is fully compatible with Ubuntu Linux. Really impressed with this laptop and glad I choose it.\n",

      "This is my 10 yr old son’s first laptop, and he loves it especially since he gets to play Fornite on it lol. I did upgrade it with a 1TB SSD. I also bought another SSD to fit into the extra drive slot, but I just couldn’t get it to fit. I tried another one and had the same problem, so I was’t able to add a second drive even though it has the space for one. I made sure I bought the right size and everything, but it just seemed like the connectors were offset. I also upgraded the RAM. Anyways, he still loves it and has been wanting to get into computer gaming, and this seems like a nice start for him. I love how the letters and symbols in the keys light up making it easier to see. I also bought him a silicon keyboard cover to keep any nasty crumbs out lol. Got a bluetooth mouse, and he was ready to go. No this is not touchscreen which I wasn’t really looking for anyway. Not a bad laptop to start with for the price even without the upgrades. It starts up in a flash and runs very smoothly.\n",

Luckily, everything else about the computer is amazing and couldn't care less about the speakers, brightness, webcam or track pad. (I use a mouse and headphones) I'm very picky when it comes to computers but I absolutely love this one. I feel like they really focused on the speed and quality. It's also very very thin, almost thinner then I like. Its in the perfect sweet spot. The top of the laptop is a beautiful silver metal (it looks stunning in person) and the material around the keyboard is also metal. I would recommend getting a mouse and headphones if you care about those things. I am happy with this laptop but I can see how someone wouldn't be if they were focused on one of the things above^^^\n",

      "Prices vary wildly on this model.  I strongly urge everyone to wait for Amazon to have them in stock at $349.Upgrading the memory is pretty much mandatory.  They ship with one 4 gig stick which means it is operating in single channel.  Ryzen processors see around a 20% increase in graphics performance when going from single to dual channel memory.  So at the very least add another 4 gig stick for a total of 8 gig.  Given that memory is very cheap right now just remove the 4 gig it ships with and add two 8 gig sticks and have 16 gig total - costs around $50 and is very, very easy to install.  If you know nothing about computers and your not sure which end of a screwdriver to hold onto you can probably still get the memory installed just by watching a couple you tube videos on how to do it.  Correct memory is 260 pin SODIMM 1.2 volt 2666MHz speed.  If it says all that in the description then it's the right memory.  Adding an additional hard drive is only slightly harder.  It will take any 2.5 inch hdd or ssd.  Just make sure you get the little micro cable seated properly when you install the drive and you will be fine.\n",

      "I was skeptical about this laptop before buying, but let me tell you something. It seems like the manufacturer was able to cut corners in smart ways to offer a really wonderful budget laptop by giving the purchaser the ability to easily add their own upgrades. I've never upgraded a laptop before, but they made it so easy for newbies like me. My old laptop was an asus from the early 2000s and performs far more superior to a lot of budget laptops. They give you a budget processor and graphics card, but they are really high quality. You can't play the newest most intense games, but if you upgrade to 8gb of ram or more, you can play a lot of earlier titles just fine. I can easily play SecondLife on medium graphics settings at 16gb of memory. Plus, the graphics even in SL look really good!! I added a 500gb ssd as well with no problem and now my laptop is perfect. The only thing I dislike about this laptop is the trackpad. The speakers also kind of suck unless you have it on a hard surface. I'm really glad I bought this laptop.\n",

Definitely don't give in to purchasing anymore software until you do all that). The keyboard has a nice feel- I really like that there's the additional number pad to the right, which makes working from home easier. And I like the matte screen so there's no glare.

I am not sure why some people who use laptops only for basic needs such as online browsing, Microsoft office, streaming, and school spend upwards of $600 on a laptop when you can get all you need at a fraction of the price with this one. I have owned a Dell, Asus, and Lenovo laptop all priced over $600 and they all had fancy stuff like 8 gb of ram, good gaming features (that I never use), lots of space (buy an external hard drive), and a few other unnecessary kinks and the value I got with this Acer laptop is better then all 3 of those combined. My girlfriend was in need of a laptop and I showed her mine and went on and on about it and she eventually bought one for herself. I am use to 8 gb of ram and was a little hesitant going down to 4 but within a few days I got use to it without any noticeable draw back.

Install of that was super easy just unscrew the 10 screws on the back pop the bottom of and there it all is. The screen quality is great.

The over all apperance and feel is great very slim and light weight but at the same time you have to ability to upgrade memory and ram so that's a big plus in my book. The CPU is just okay I mean you get what you pay for. As far as playing games it will play Grim Dawn on high graphics with no real issues I was impressed by that. Also very easy to take it out of Microsoft s mode pleantt of YouTube videos and Google's to show you how. Overall I'm very pleased with the laptop.\n",

      "Bought one of these to replace a terrible Lenova laptop (that had much better specs) the wife had been using for nursing school.  She absolutely loves it and has had ZERO complaints.  Just bought one for the kid as she is doing online school this year.  As far as the many complaints in reviews about the Windows 10S... my wife was able to open it to home version for free in a matter of minutes following the link that provides directions given in the questions section here on this page.  So... I don't know why people are shelling out $130 other than they didn't bother to do a little research first.  It is not a powerhouse and isn't intended to be, so people complaining about that aren't really informed either.  It has a BEAUTIFUL display but you shouldn't buy a $350 laptop and expect it to run complex modeling software like Mastercam or games that would bring a Geforce RTX 2080 to its knees.  Know what you need before you buy.  This is a great laptop for its intended capabilities.\n",

      "I bought this laptop having a 1 TB HDD and 32 GB of RAM to add into the system. With those added components, the device is unbeatable, especially at this price point. Contrary to some critical reviews, this laptop can be permanently switched out of S mode on a one-way basis (can't go back to S mode after) completely free of charge. There is no additional cost to go from Windows 10S mode to Windows 10 Home. The screen is beautiful. Highly recommended as long as the constraints of the 128 GB boot drive and 4 GB RAM (2 GB dedicated to the APU) are fully understood. Even purchasing an 8 GB stick or something will still have this laptop come in cheaper than any other option. Solid build quality too. Recommended.\n",

      "Use this for college. Really like the fast startup time, is ready to go in seconds, feature comes in handy when arriving late to a lecture. The recording feature is great at 25 feet. Battery is reasonable, depending the use and screen brightness, it can go 6hrs. Screen looks decent outside.I didn't like the operating system it came with, since it doesn't let you install software, only apps. But it lets you change it to Windows 10 at no additional cost, it was fast and really easy, found the instructions online.\n",

      "I bought this same laptop last fall and have had no issues with it. I bought another one in late February, and since I have had it, the earphone plug has worked twice. I have troubleshooted this repeatedly, and it always shows that no earphones are plugged in. I have tried two different sets of earbuds, and neither works. Therefore, I have concluded that it is a defect. Also, this laptop has glitched multiple times where the screen just goes black, and I try to hit escape, and it is frozen. The only way I can fix this is to turn it off and then back on. I am certain this isn't supposed to do this. I tried reaching out to the manufacturer but was placed on an indefinite hold. I realize this is most likely attributed to the Coronavirus and the company may be shut down. I need this laptop to work!\n",

Now the screen looks as if it was dropped from a 2nd floor.  Cracks and lines everywhere; thus useless.  I called Acer's technical support hoping it would be covered under warranty.  Nope, he said \"since this is not a defect, warranty won't likely covered it.  But you can still send it in and pay for the repairs plus diagnostic fee.\"  No thanks, I can probably get a brand new one for about the same.  I have 3 words for you Acer... Flimsy, flimsy, FLIMSY!\n",

      "It is a bargain, particularly considering the ease of upgrading.  Acer describes in a youtube video how to open the case and install a hard drive.  The computer is even shipped with the 4 mounting screws needed for the hard drive install.  I installed a 1 TB solid state drive, in addition to the 128 GB drive that it is shipped with, so I now have plenty of storage space.  The computer also has an empty memory slot, so I added a 4 GB memory stick. The computer seems quicker in Windows 10 with the 8 GB of memory than it was with 4 GB.  For those who like Linux, the computer is also compatible with the latest Ubuntu version 19.10.  My laptop is now set up to dual boot with Xubuntu 19.10 and Windows 10.  Ubuntu was trivial to install, and the video, sound, and networking all work as expected in Linux.\n",

What I will say is that this laptop beat the outperforms my old Acer that has one of the original Intel Core i7 and 8 GB of memory, even after replacing it's original HDD with an SSD drive. I would highly recommend installing an additional 4 to 8 GB of memory though. I opted for 8 GB and am glad I did. I didn't purchase another SSD for this new Acer as I have a 3 TB USB 3.1 external drive for storage.I've only had it for two days, but I don't do much more than check emails, watch YouTube videos & Netflix, a lot of Web surfing and Facebook. I am totally impressed with how quick this budget laptop is.\n",

I did deactivate the \"S\"  function on WIndows 10, very simple to do, and I am able to upload whatever I choose, so no problem there. The graphics are great, colors super sharp.

I like that the keyboard light times out so that it's not distracting while watching a movie and the speaker quality shocked me. I did decide to upgrade the RAM to 12 GB since 4 is so low. It feels very high quality and I like the aluminum cover. Overall I would recommend this computer.\n",

      "After adding another stick of 8 GB of memory (now 12 GB total), it is much better.  Screen is decent, performance acceptable, sound OK, keyboard comfortable, Internet connection flawless, battery life not test yet, form factor lightweight and price cheaper.  For $300 (on Black Friday) with the upgraded memory , it is the best budget laptop in 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a solid laptop. Nothing too fancy, but not bad at all. The only issue that I have with it, is that the sound is very low even with the volume all the way up. For instance, the sound of one of those cheap $20 box fans is louder than the laptop while it is directly in my face, so I'm probably gonna get a Bluetooth speaker for it. Also, it doesn't have a light to let you know if caps lock is active or not. Besides that, it's pretty good.\n",

It clearly should have never been shipped. But the return was so smooth. It just held me up for 2 days. So I’m not going to give the a bad review based on that.For the price this is a very nice laptop. This was for someone else but I set it up and got to play with it a little. The SSD makes it quick and the cpu is fairly snappy. I was surprised with the actual performance for the price. This laptop is perfect for web surfing, Emails, word processing, and other lightweight applications. I can say for anything else, because I didn’t test it.

Now I will say all our business is online and cloud driven so we do not and will not load any applications on it.

As a college student, this computer gets what I need done. It works quick and the screen quality is great! There's very few occasions where something like files will be a bit more blurry, but it doesn't bother me too much. The only big complaint I have about this laptop is the ultra sensitive mouse/touch pad. Occasionally it will spaz out and I'll lose where I was or it will click and drag when I barely touch the touch pad. This was easy to solve though. The price of this laptop allowed me to have some extra money left to purchase a wireless mouse. Overall, I can say this is a great laptop. Especially for school.\n",

      "Super fast shipping. I would have had it a lot sooner had it not been for UPS messing up. But still delivered in the time frame the company gave me. It was brand new in a factory sealed box. Super speedy and the graphics quality is amazing. IT was very easy to take out of S-Mode, and to get rid of the small amount of bloatware in it. I must say this is the first computer/laptop I have bought that there was not a ton of bloatware with it. The only two drawbacks and they are very minor is I wish I could remove the X-Box software as I have no need for it and the fan likes to run a lot and is on the loud side. But I was able to solve that some by going into the systems cooling settings and adjusting them some. Other then that I am extremely happy with my purchase and the quality of service I received with it. Super easy to set up, even for beginners. Great product great price!\n",

I have them turned all the way up, and this particular model does not let you adjust the sound effects. I did not want to purchase an attached speaker, but I might have to. The screen is dull and not too bright. I just am glad I am using this for nothing too major. I had to switch to my old desk top for using it in my classroom. Bummed.\n",

I hate Windows operating system but that has little to nothing to do with the laptop.  It stays charged pretty decently.  I haven't timed it.  Overall, for the price, I think it's great.

The speakers are below the laptop and is garbage. I can barely stand to hear anything. I had to buy clip on speakers to hear minimal hearing. You will need to buy external speakers to be comfortable with this device.\n",

I am not an expert but I did my research to understand the minimum specs I needed prior to replacing my 8 year old laptop.  My computing needs are basic (internet, email, documents, light photo editing) and the specs met or exceeded what I was looking for.  The AMD Ryzen 3 is highly rated although certainly not the fastest processer available - however, it's very fast and a huge improvement over my sluggish 8 year old laptop.  The HD screen is sharp, clear and an absolute bargain in this price range!  The storage is easy and inexpensive to upgrade so that wasn't something I focused on when choosing.  I've recommended this laptop to several of my friends with similar computing needs.\n",

      "One month of ownership & paid just over $300. All things considered, I'm definitely impressed. I landed on this because of a combination of price, written reviews, easy DIY upgrade-ability, and how much I liked my six year old Aspire M5 w/ Windows 7. Spilled half a packet of papa john's garlic butter through its keyboard while knocking back drunk pizza, so here I am.Only reason I give this a 4 star is because I think some of the reviews, that many of you are surely reading, need a little deflation. If you expect the rig to run as speedily as publicly advertised I'd plan on the ram upgrade (4gb to 8gb). For example, this Acer surfs the web noticeably slower than the 6 year old previous Acer, all other conditions remaining equal. Other things, such as how nice the screen looks, are accurate if you ask me. I am also a little bitter about Windows 10 -- feels confined... unfair for me to blame the laptop but I feel like I still do.\n",

Well after just a few month of having it the screen went completely crazy and I can’t see anything. I was using it to watch Netflix got a pop up saying it needed to restart for new software and after that the screen was so distorted I couldn’t see a thing. A new computer that is rarely used should not have this problem.  Now after paying so much for a new computer I’m going to have to pay someone to fix it. Very disappointed\n",

I wanted SSD, lit keyboard, decent processor and graphics plus it had to be thin and light. This laptop ticked all the boxes. When I read the reviews describing how easy it was to upgrade the ram to 8 gigs I was in. This laptop boots in under 10 seconds and comes back from sleeping even faster. It's no gaming laptop, but for sitting on the couch in the dark watching TV and browsing, it is all I need. I installed the Samsung 4 gig stick of ram others have recommended in their reviews. Although the first stick I received from Amazon was no good (wouldn't boot) Amazon replaced it and the second stick works fine.

My only complaint is why do the power cords on these things always have trouble staying connected? I do end up having to tape it in place but to be honest that’s no different from any other laptop I’ve ever had.

After experimenting and trying very hard to figure out, I called Acer. The support agent said it is max 16 so if you put 16GB the laptop wouldn't handle which is NOT true!!!! And the agent also said you cannot add 500GB SSD which is NOT true!!!!! I ended up bringing it to Best Buy for a quick consultation. They took a look and found that ram is working in one of RAM slots (it has 2 slots) and the other one is defective by some sort of dirts or something. I'm so dissapointed cuz I was quite excited and always thought Acer laptops are quite nice. The laptop itself is very nice I cannot deny. It is nicely made and you will enjoy using it if you get a nice one.\n",

Im really liking the back lit keyboard as well, it has a nice feel and the travel of the keys is just right. For $300 it’s a fairly good looking computer. Sure it’s a lil plastic-y on the bottom and around the screen, but it’s not a $1000 computer so no complaints. The only minor thing that really bothers me is the speakers.

For simple tasks (email, office applications, streaming videos, light gaming) this laptop works perfect. I plan to upgrade the 4gb of RAM to 8gb at some point, but after using it has become less of a priority. It works great out of the box.

It’s kind of frustrating since I usually just go to school with my former laptop and don’t have to charge it for 10 + hours. I got additional RAM. So the display is beautiful.

I contacted customer service and attempted to fix it twice, but the glitching black screen continued to occur. I need this computer for school so sending it for repair which will take 10 days is too long. Another issue I dealt with is that the laptop gets really hot and the fan whirs very loudly. I've never had issues like these with any of my previous laptops especially within 1 week of purchasing! I think I got a defective laptop. This laptop has given me a headache.\n",

Unfortunately, this laptop is not especially designed for distance working. It's ability to stay connected to the internet is negligible (it works ok until you connect to something like zoom and then it drops the connection multiple times during the call ), and it's webcam is not the best quality. I've actually reverted to using my old laptop for anything I need to record and broadcast because even with it's flaws the webcam provides a much crisper picture than the one on this Acer. But, for word processing, email, and basic internet use, this Acer gets the job done.\n",

The power supply is very small, and the laptop is a very reasonable size as well. The one thing I didn't like was that I didn't notice that it doesn't have an optical (cd/dvd) drive and I was surprised when I bought a CD and couldn't use it. It has a few USB ports, and the ethernet port came in handy a few times.Can't really do any heavy lifting, Skyrim was pretty choppy at high settings.\n",

Not remotely designed for hardcore gaming, but I find I can stream my Steam game's from my gaming PC through Steam rather well. Works best to hard wire it for that purpose. Wi-Fi tends to struggle a bit on that end. Can play some older game's on high settings.Battery life is pretty solid. Watched 6 hours of Netflix before needing a charge.\n",

      "I bought this entry level Acer as an extra to have around and wasn't expecting much for the price.  Everything about this computer is very good EXCEPT for the low volume of the sound.  I'm not talking about quality of sound but the actual volume. I wasn't expecting BOSE quality, but I was expecting the volume to be loud when on 100%; it isn't.  Here's what I did, checked drivers, opened the Realtek to confirm all were set at 100%.  Upon researching other reviews, I noticed similar low volume issues; it appears that this is where Acer skimped. (I have an entry level Toshiba that has horrible quality sound, but it is loud.) I need to Blu-tooth an external speaker just so I don't have to bring my ears to w/in 8\" just to hear.  Of course, it doesn't help that Acer put the speakers on the bottom, yes, the bottom of the unit. It's a shame that Acer did so much right for the price, only to mess up on a incredibly low volume!  Would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100%?  The answer to my rhetorical question is no, but they did anyway.Overall, I would have given the unit 4 stars, maybe even 5, but the horrible max volume of the speakers rates this unit a 3, at best, unfortunately.\n",

I initially had some issue with it pausing randomly and the fan going on but they went away so that may have been software related.One big thing to me is that the num lock button has no light on it so you never know when it's on or off. Normally this isn't a big issue but on this laptop the number pad is shared with the home and end buttons which I use a lot of. So I never know if I press that key if it will go home or output the number 7. Also the touch pad doesn't have a intuitive right click (you have to double click to get right click). Other than that it does what I need it to do which is check email.\n",

It’s not that light but it is very slim, and attractive in the silver. I’m happy with my purchase. Battery life is so so. Holds great while not using it but if the screen is on, it only lasts maybe 3 hours. Does charge in about an hour though. Biggest and by far worst complaint after having it a while, the sound is really subpar. Trying to watch videos on it without some type of earphone is very hard. Sound is not good.\n",

It jumps all over the place, from site to site for no apparent reason. I wanted an easy to operate computer. This is not it!

It also freezes a lot and I have to restart all my apps, sometimes losing work. I did buy extra memory stick for it since I do graphics on it. This was the biggest waste of money, ever.

If you want to get out of Windows Home S, it is super easy--watch 30 second tutorial on YouTube. I prefer Chrome as a browser, so I opted to switch out of S, and it was done in under 1 minute. I use web based programs, Word, and Excel. This machine can do infinitely more than I will ever need it to.

I have been using this Laptop Since May 2020 which i upgraded it to 16Gb Ram from 8gb which i did when i purchase it and 1tb SSd and to this day i have yet to have a problem. Take it out of S mode which i did from day one and the screen is very clear and better on my external monitor, keyboard is amazing in the dark as its backlit and the mouse pad is great...it really beats the i5 8th gen because the GPU is better especially in games where fortnite and Halo would skip frames.......overall for a budget i give it 4.5\n",

I was fairly hesitant to get a laptop that was 15.6\", as my last one was pretty heavy. This computer is super lightweight and has an AMAZING screen. It's incredibly bright and crisp. I originally wanted a Macbook, but this has comparable features that can't be beat with this price. I've had my computer shut and days later, I will find my computer still with charge instead of being dead. The backlit keyboard is a very nice feature that can be turned off. The overall computer looks very nice and sleek. I'd recommend this computer. It's also much quicker than my HP laptop that I had bought months back. The screen also bends completely flat which gives a nice range of motion, depending where it's at. The only slightly negative thing is that the webcam is not very crisp. You can see yourself, but it's not the best.\n",

It charges very well and holds its charge well even through constant use. It’s great for some light gaming, I’ve installed Team Fortress 2, Stardew Valley, Valorant, Minecraft and Slime Rancher on this and they all run great And I’ve still got space for more games. If you’re looking to play fortnite on this and have other games I don’t think this would work out. The Epic Store requires 100gb to install fortnite, this laptop or atleast the version I got has 128gb and I would rather have more than 28gb left to work on. In all this is a great laptop that gets good FPS and good quality on most games.\n",

Spoke with Microsoft tech support, who initiated a remote session and informed me that I did not have a genuine copy of windows installed. So, I had to spend another $150 to purchase a legit Windows 10 Home key to activate my new laptop to switch out of the 'S Mode' garbage.I didn't even know shipping illegitimate copies of Windows was legal!

It might be super fantastic, but I don't really feel the need to experiment as I'm fine with regular Windows.

      "I would not recommend buying this.  I purchased in March 2020 to prepare for working remotely.  Everything was fine- it all worked as it should.  Now the built-in camera has stopped functioning properly.  It looks like it is working but there is only a black screen in the image window- for both camera and video.  On zoom calls, it looks like the video is working but there is nothing but a black screen. Open up the camera using the camera app- same thing.  Updating driver shows that the current driver is installed.  Resetting the app does nothing. Resetting privacy settings does nothing. Troubleshooting does nothing- all diagnostics indicate that everything is \"working properly\", no issues. One day it worked fine.  The next day it did not.  Searches on both the Acer community forum on their website and google in general show multiple users all reporting the same exact problem- and following all of the same steps, with absolutely no resolution. Chatting with Acer technical support- the best they can offer is \"try a factory reset\" and if that doesn't work, send it in for repair.  Which of course is impossible because the laptop is now my office for work since my company is still working remotely for the foreseeable future. So in order to send this one in to be repaired, I would need to buy a new one anyway in order to keep my job.  I've had multiple laptops over the years- HP, Asus, samsung-  all worked for years.  This is the first (and hopefully only time) that I've had one stop functioning in less than 4 months after purchase- with no viable resolution offered by the company.**EDIT-  Factory Reset fixed nothing and just made re-setting up everything that was removed a pain in the butt.  Camera is still non-functional.  Acer tech support and customer support useless.  No solution offered other than sending the laptop that I rely on every day in for repair- despite the fact that you can easily google and find the same issue reported by multiple users going back to at least 2018.  Support rep that I spoke to the second time claimed that on their system, they don't show that there are any reported issues with the Aspire 5.  SMH. Worst customer service ever.

I can easily see myself buying this as a gift for loved ones -- and, yes, the Windows OS can easily be switched out of S Mode so that you may install useful third party apps like Google Chrome's web browser, etc.If you can afford just one hardware upgrade, I would recommend spending an addition $70 or so by adding one 16 GB stick of RAM (make sure it checks out for this model number at Crucial.com before ordering) where the 4 GB stick rests, then moving the 4 GB stick to the second RAM slot (RAM GB do not need to match, common misconception).  You could add two 16 GB sticks of RAM but anyone purchasing this isn't going to be pushing the hardware monstrously, so it's better to bide your time and pick that up in the future, when 16 GB RAM will probably be much cheaper, if you must.\n",

The solid-state drive is greatly high quality and really carries the laptop, with an immensely quick startup and data reading (it is very responsive and opens field effortlessly). This is all assuming you understand it’s a baseline laptop and aren’t purchasing for gaming or AutoCAD-like tasks. I can play minecraft on it on lowest setting, but that’s the limit. (Which is impressive anyway for this build.) The graphics as well are akin to that of a(n older) kindle fire, with more color. That said, it’s as well impressively bright and can be used in medium sunlight. Beyond that, the speakers are very poor and quiet, not a big deal to me but good to know. One of the best thing about the laptop is the connectivity, with nearly all ports aside from SD card. With the lower GB SSD I got a 64 GB flash drive for files and with the USB 3.0 the write speed is quite up to par. It arrived already in S mode but you get a free opt-out, no biggy.

On top of that it seemed every unresponsive and you had to either press the trackpad in a certain spot or press it multiple times and hoped it worked. Secondly the screen quality was actually terrible. I thought based on others reviews they were exaggerating, but no. Lastly, the laptop froze multiple times (JUST OUT OF THE BOX!) I had to reset it about 3-4 times. This occurred while I was only on google and watching YouTube. I never intended on gaming on this, but as you can see if it can’t even handle google.. good luck.

There are 2 cons that you may want to keep in mind: the sound and camera quality are not the best...maybe even \"terrible\"? I don't have to have the best camera quality and I use a speaker or headphones for the sound, so it doesn't bother me so much.\n",

      "Amazing CPU, ram, SSD, and IPS screen meaning best value for your typical laptop usage. It's aluminum so feels/look really sleek and doesn't gunk up like plastic. Only issue is the trackpad has the left/right click hidden under, and not being able to actually feel where the buttons are but also being able to move the mouse when I'm trying to click is pretty annoying. It's annoying for me a lot actually where I wish it had buttons, but the general specs and metal cover are too good to pass up. Don't think any other laptop can compete at this pricepoint for how fast it will work and how good the panel will look.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are looking for a laptop to browse the internet and use Microsoft Office programs then consider this laptop. The SSD has you online less than 30 seconds after booting up. It is light weight and portable. My only criticism is that part of the charger cord is quite thin so be careful if you have pets (such as cats) that like to go after wires.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fired this thing up one evening and I was delighted at how well it ran to use the internet. (I bought a Lenovo laptop recently with better specs, and was disappointed at it's internet performance - but I digress.) I transported it to work the  next morning, and when I took it out the touchpad appeared to be popping out a little big (see pic). It easily popped back in, and I didn't notice any control problems - but this is literally the first 24 hours. Can't fault for performance, but maybe this one slipped through Quality Control. Not taking any chances. Back it goes.\n",

The connection is slow, and the computer will not allow you access without a Microsoft account. Setting up a Microsoft account without a fast connection is next to impossible. Just getting the computer to find my internet connection took the better part of the first morning.I'm giving this one more day before packing it up and returning it.\n",

      "I needed a laptop for school and the usual online activity (checking email, shopping etc) It' s been a while since I bought a laptop, I usually use the laptops provided by my employer. I decided to get a laptop for personal use and keep work for work.  After reading the reviews I decided to get the Acer Aspire 5, it was easy to get started and runs great!  I am not a super technical/gaming person and I am happy with it.  For what I use this laptop for it will be sufficient, runs great.  I may purchase a 2nd laptop for my son, for the price you really can't beat it.\n",

      "This is my first laptop of this brand (Acer).. I'm very disappointed with is operating speed.  I've only owned tablets and Chrome books before, and never had the problems I've had with this laptop.. I only use this Acer laptop for streaming videos on YouTube and Netflix. The time it takes for simple videos to load blows my mind! And the lag when typing a simple comment ( I'm NOT fast at typing ) is sooo slow! If all you need to do is stream a video and do some online shopping, SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy something else!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Bought this on Prime Day at $269.00.  Although it comes with only 4GB of ram... laptop is easily upgradeable via removing back panel and adding more ram. The display is the big bonus here at this price point. A true 1080P HD IPS panel. Although the disk size is small (128GB M.2 Sata3) it is fast. And WIndows 10 S is easily converted to Windows 10 home. For the Linux users... this thing is a pain to do a dual-boot install of Linux and Windows. The BIOS is modded by Acer and is difficult to change AHCI to Legacy in order to boot from USB. Keyboard is backlit and battery life is acceptable at a tested 4.5 hours at full brightness.\n",

I swapped out the ram with this ram. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JWG53DG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The keyboard lights up with a good layout and the screen is nice and bright too. I recommend this laptop as a good budget laptop for the money. It needs the upgraded ram though!\n",

      "The initial setup was easy, so that’s one of the few pluses. The screen, while big, has a resolution that makes the words blurry. I bought this to make a computer based college class easier. While functions in Microsoft Access may be more developed on this operating system than Macs, it is legitimately frustrating using the touchpad on this thing. Maybe I have to dial in the touchpad’s functions more, but MacBooks are so much simpler in this aspect. It automatically highlights things when I just want to scroll, clicks when I’m just scrolling, picks and chooses when it pauses when I use the space button, and enters full screen when I’m just trying to drag a pane to the side. I waste more time dealing with this than I do working on the classwork.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lagging, i dont know why it is but everything lags. Even moving the mouse has a huge delay. Its so bad I had to return it, nothing like the former acer which was a lovely budget computer for gaming. The loud is the worst, Ive never heard worse sound for a laptop. Its too low and barely audible on the highest setting with how loud the fan is\n",

      "Bought this as a first laptop for my daughter. Everything works as expected and no real complaints, except one, she navigates it easily.. This laptop, for whatever reason, the keyboard gets into a funky state. Sometimes a key will produce a capital when caplock is off.. In notepad, I noticed that when I pressed a letter repeatedly I would get, aaAaaAAAaaa. As an example. All keys behaved this way. Numbers will do the same but throw in special characters.  Have to reboot the laptop to get out of this state.  This has happened numerous times. Very annoying but you get what you pay for.So if you have this laptop and can't log into it or into applications or websites, reboot it.\n",

I don't use this for anything other than staying organized and keeping my life in order. A lot of reviews say to switch out the storage and to get off S mode but I have not come into any problems with keeping it like it is yet. I'm writing this review because I was unsure after reading about all the upgrades that should be done in order to be happy. Maybe I'm not a picky person but this computer is just what I needed and suffices to my needs! Hope this helps. I'm not tech savvy but I do know a good laptop when I see one and the price was even better!!\n",

      "Only needed a laptop for college work on the go, didn't want to spend a lot of money, but wanted something good all around. Stumbled upon this gem. $300 for a good amount! Latest gen Ryzen CPU, 4GB of DDR4 2666Mhz RAM (Fast), and a 128GB NVMe (Fast) Storage Drive. Took the 4GB of RAM and added another 8GB for a total of 12GB, and upgraded the SSD to a 512GB NVMe drive. Fits everything I needed it to do. Quick, backlit keys, crystal clear display, decent sound, and excellent battery life. Spent a total of about $450 for the laptop, the upgrades, a laptop bag, mouse and mousepad. Insane value. Would recommend this to anyone who just needs a laptop for office work, college, etc. Don't expect this to be suitable for gaming. Good job Acer!\n",
      "\n",
      "For the price, you can't beat it.  Has great graphics, great sound system, and this keyboard is the BEST!.  A slight sluggishness in some performance but nothing that effects anything.  Does not have a touchscreen and definitely not a gaming machine, but great for anything else.I am on mine now and deliberately bought it to run Linux on it (not Windows).  I am currently running LinuxMint 19.3 beta on it and it is working perfect!\n",
      "\n",
      "This laptop is perfect for your basic needs. Ram and storage are pretty low, but you can upgrade them rather easily. It's fast and the screen is really sharp, probably my favorite part. From my use so far the audio quality is pretty good but a bit muffled in some cases based on where I have it. Overall no major complaints, it does whatever I need it to for college and I can even run some of my older games on it which is nice. Don't expect much there though. Any games will have to either decently old or run on low settings if you can run them at all. But this certainly isn't meant to be for gaming out of the box. I'd say it's a great buy for anyone going into college that wants something cheap, but reliable, with a nice screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this last year for my grandson for school. He loves it ,so do I. The lit keys at night is a great bonus. It's very fast, has amazing colors. I only paid $314. I need another one for his brother but the price today with taxes is a most $500!! I can't afford that price. As much as I love this item if it doesn't come down in price I'll have to pass!!!!\n",

      "I got it for my kid and kept the windows S mode so I don't have to worry about killing nasty viruses from time to time... first time in years I didn't have to install Linux to avoid windows infestations so the S mode trick is holding on so far. The computer itself is decent. Acer did a good job with the design, its light and performs perfectly for productivity suites, browsing the web, watching videos and listening to music. The keyboard looks cheap but is decent enough and is backlit. The build quality has its flows here and there, especially around the front of the screen but the price is amazing so can't complain. First time using AMD chipset in a long time, Ryzen seems to be a good deal overall... mobile power consumption definitely not on par with Intel but again, amazing price. I suspect this laptop is a great fit for students and mainstream  consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the price, this laptop is excellent.  I did add another 4GB stick of RAM and a 250 GB SSD.  Boots up very quickly and is a significant improvement over previous laptop that used standard hard drive.  Install of the RAM was simple and can be done by anyone.  The SSD install was also fairly easy for someone that is used to working with computer parts, but if you a first timer, would seek help or at least a Youtube tutorial.  Battery life is good and processor speed is plenty fast for normal web surfing and basic office tasks.Really have no cons at this price point.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had high hopes for this machine as a first machine for my kid. It has been nothing but a PITA. I upgraded the ram to max, which wasn't expensive, the graphics quality could be better for games. Had it only a month and it's already having heating issues when gaming on low end games like Roblox. Don't waste your money.\n",

      "Not being a computer geek, I barely managed to learn the essentials on our old PC. When it was diagnosed as being \"too old\", I ordered this laptop, which our son and several friends said we needed. It's amazing! So light and easy to carry, and it responded as soon as I followed the (very limited) directions! But I have  managed to accomplish so much more with this easy-to-learn technology than I ever thought possible at age 77! This laptop was fairly inexpensive, but we know and trust ACER products, and it seems capable of all that I will ever need it to do. And Amazon delivered it only 2-3 days after I had submitted the order. I am a happy woman!\n",
      "\n",
      "I I had so many expectations about this laptop, especially on the AMD processor. The overall performance it is OK but has not complete my expectations. I had a 2015 Intel i3-5010U ASUS laptop and the difference with this one is not noticible at all. In fact, I can hear so much the fan noise with the same time and usage of the old one. The battery life is, in my opinion, awful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I waited for a long time to buy a new computer.  I finally purchased this laptop but less than 2 months later the touchpad already stopped working.  I have talked to Acer customer service and done all the troubleshooting, even a factory reset, and still it doesn't work.  I was never able to get the touchscreen/tablet mode to work but I didn't look into it too much.  Either it's difficult to set up or it hasn't worked from the beginning.  Acer customer service wants me to send it to them to fix but I can't be without a computer for weeks.  It's a crappy position to be in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Updating my comment from previously. I've had this laptop for a couple of months and it's been working good so far. I like the ease of using the keyboard and the speed of multi-tasking. I have many tabs open and other programs open all at once and have no problem switching back and forth, without lag. Only a couple of issues I have; the charge doesn't last long. It doesn't take much to fully charge but the full charge only lasts a couple of hours. One of the reasons I purchased this was based on reviews that it lasted a while, but that's not the case with my laptop. The only other minor issue is the caps and number lock doesn't have any indicators, so I have no way of knowing if they're on or off until I type, which is annoying when typing case sensitive passwords. I prefer the home and end buttons to be separate buttons and not part of the number keyboard. As for the backlit keyboard, it has a on/off button so you can control its use. With the caps and number locks, there's no indicator on the screen nor is there a light that lets you know if these are activated or not. Other than that it does the job I need it to do, especially for the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "I work from home and wanted a new laptop to replace my old, slow one. Besides basic email, internet, and Office, I don't need my laptop to do much and wanted to keep it near $300. This was the perfect choice. I love the bright, crisp screen, the backlit keyboard, and sleek brushed aluminum look. It's amazing how much faster I can work when I don't have to wait for everything to respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "For $309 this is pretty much the best windows laptop out there.  It's quite fast - the only slight bottleneck is the 4gb of ram (only if you use a ton of chrome tabs and videos), so I upgraded to 8gb for $38.  The IPS panel screen has very good colors and the keyboard/touchpad are decent.  The body is pretty with the brushed aluminum.  It also boots up faster than my gaming pc with an ssd which is nice for a laptop.  The battery can last up to 6:30 hours when I was just browsing the web and taking notes, with the screen dimmed and on battery saver mode.  Best battery life mode, heavy tasks, and high brightness will probably land you more like 2-3 hours to drain to 0%.  Altough really you should only run the battery of any Lithium Ion down to 20-30% before recharging to get the best lifespan.The only downside is it feels a bit flimsy, and the touchpad after a week kinda makes a clicky sound when you just touch it (not actually clicking it).  Still, definitely worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had this PC for about 2 months and it seems to have cooling issues. Even just web browsing can cause the fan to run. Task manager shows peaks of up to 100 percent cpu usage briefly when just opening a web site like cnn or fox news and then fan goes into overdrive. I used it at the end of the couch and thought i am blocking the bottom vents so i been using it on a cutting board so the bottom feet can make a gap to increase air flow but it has not helped. Cpu will get over 80 celsius at times all from just web browsing. This pc gets good reviews so maybe i got a bad one ? Barely has any cooling ducts from the slim design. I did install 16 gigs of DDR4 ram as well so that's not the problem. Opted out of S mode for regular windows aswell\n",

      "Laptop is not new it was a return with windows 10 S that was already activated by someone else. Now I cannot activate windows 10 to 10 home. Windows is in S mode, cannot download anything. BEWARE! Every time I try to takeout of s mode it says the windows license isn’t valid. I keep getting a message that the window 10 operating system is “non genuine”. This has happened to a lot of other people if you read the 1 star reviews.  Stay away from this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love the slim and light design, we’ve had the same laptop for some years now so this is a huge upgrade for us. Love that the keyboard lights up in a dark light condition, but we got it for photo editing and couldn’t be more satisfied\n",
      "\n",
      "I like this laptop.  It's a back up machine, which I don't use daily, but it functions really well.  It's not  super fast, but fast enough for my browsing, email and writing projects.  I'm not a gamer, so its limitations don't trouble me.  The back lit keyboard is a really good feature, and the display looks sharp and true to me.  it plays well with  all my peripherals.  The only downside is windows S mode which is utterly worthless and endlessly annoying---none of the apps I use for business or personal use are on the windows store.  Microsoft should be ashamed....But I highly recommend the computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've always been a HP or Toshiba guy and for some reason always found the ACER brand name unappealing.  I swung on this one after reading the reviews and am glad I did. ***** Disclaimer- I added 4 GB RAM to it I had from another laptop.  This is the best, fastest, no glitches, sturdy, beautiful laptop I've ever owned.  It simply does everything well and does it quickly.  If I accidentally broke it today I'd order another one now.  Highly recommend. Great product.\n",

      "Besides this not having Microsoft Office, you can't even download Chrome without switching out of S Mode.  This is my first S Mode laptop and I didn't know what it meant when I bought it and I don't even know how to switch it.  Explorer Edge also gave me a hard time.  When doing something as simple as online shopping, the page always has a recover page error. And when I try to scroll, it lags. I give it a 3 since I know I can google how to do all these things but just haven't made the effort to find the solution myself. The only other thing I noticed was that the volume wasn't that loud when watching Netflix, I'd always have to have the subtitles on or connect to my bluetooth speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the money, this device is very nice. But the Windows 10 S Mode was the reason why I give this three stars even leaning to two, however.I wanted to dumb this laptop down and get the right programs for my 90 year old relative so that she is not required to enter her account multi times, and to be able to use her laptop without crap being bombarded at her. She will be using it for Facebook and the browsing the web only. She will not be a heavy user of anything else. One would believe that S Mode would be perfect for this situation. But I wanted he to be able to choose the Antivirus and the browser (I work in IT), I felt was best for her and that the MS app store does not allow this. It's their crap or the highway.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't write a lot of reviews but I use them a lot so it's only fair that I leave one occasionally. If you are going to use this laptop for surfing, watching movies, or other general connection activities, I'm not sure why you would spend more. I did buy an extra 4gb ram which was easy to install. Cortana walks you through setup. Super easy. I switched out of S mode also super easy (watch the Acer YouTube video). The screen is lovely and the backlit keyboard make it feel like a premium device for easy on the budget $. I burn through laptops every couple of years so if it lasts that long I'm golden.\n",
      "\n",
      "At less than 300 dollars, this was a great value. I especially appreciate the backlit keyboard which my prior budget laptops did not have. I added 4GB of Crucial RAM for $20 which helped keep it running smoothly. The only draw back is the system fans direct the heat to the bottom, which heats up your lap after a few minutes. The speakers are bottom mounted which lowers the sound output but nonetheless it's sufficient for quiet room viewing of Netflix or YouTube.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really love this laptop I’m in college and I’m studying nursing. Needed something lightweight and easy to carry around and do schoolwork on. It’s perfect and it pairs well with my AirPods. It comes in S mode but I was able to take it off of S mode after updating the laptop and logging into my Microsoft account. To get it out of S mode all you have to do is go into settings, select updated & security, click activation on the right side, then click go to Microsoft store (the first one), and then it’ll take you to the Microsoft store and you’ll see take out of S mode for Free, press that and you’re done.\n",

      "As tested: Ryzen 3 3200, 4GB RAM (Upgraded to 8GB), 128GB SSD (Added 2TB HDD)This is an excellent laptop for light work, and can be easily upgraded. I added more RAM and a 2TB hard drive. There's an extra slot for the ram, and an empty HDD bay, so the upgrade was very straightforward.\n",

      "I needed to replace a 5 year old Dell laptop that was slow from the day I got it.  Read all of the reviews and decided to try this Acer.  The price was listed as $309.00.  The day I placed my order, the price changed to $319.00.  Now as I am writing the review the price is once again $309.  OK $10 difference no big deal, just found the pricing to be strange. I do like the Acer.  It is fast and a huge improvement over my old Dell.  Backlit keyboard is great.  I don't understand why there isn't a light for the caps or number lock.  But again, not a big deal.  My HP printer will not connect.  I think I may need to take the laptop out of S mode.\n",

      "I studied and studied specs and reviews for several laptop computers. This one was the best out of all of them offering a high speed processor and 4GB of memory (I upgraded mine to 8GB). The lighted keys really help in the dark and the screen quality is close to that on a Macbook Pro or Air. For the price you will not be disappointed. Very lightweight and portable. Has excellent battery life.\n",

      "Does all that was expected. I'll let someone else do the technical review.  Very fast and efficient.  Great screen quality.

If you can afford a high end laptop get one if not this is a great laptop for everyday use.\n",

      "This laptop is amazing. Went through the reviews and ultimately came down to this one. I had an $850 budget to get a laptop and this was well within the budget even with the upgrades to the memory and a new hard drive installed. I installed a 1 tb pro barracuda hard drive, system reads it as 958 gb. You will need a new hard drive if you plan on playing games because the 128 gb NVME that comes with it is not enough.I also upgraded the memory, 2 sticks of 8 gb ram. Systems reads it as around 14 gb though.  Any memory is fine to be honest as long as it's 260 pin DDR4. I used Team Group Elite DDR4 2666 260 pin ram sticks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the overall speed which I could set up the computer to use it for the purpose that I need it for . It is very fast efficient and simple to use. It is a sleek , attractive computer with highly visual graphics that allow the end-user to adjust for even finer specifics if one wants to do so. However, for me I am good with it out of the box. Exceptional computer well made with the everyday user in mind. Excellent Product! I did not use it for gaming nor did I attempt to use the touchscreen so I really didn't provide any feedback on these features.\n",

      "I love it !!! I had Lenowo laptop for 245$ and it was POS. It had terible display, pity battery life. On the other hand this laptop has beautiful, crisp, display, it is lightweight, thin, the battery life is even better than producer said, beautiful lighted keybord, fast wifi and for this price it doesn't look cheap at all because of its beautiful alluminium cover. The only thing which it does lack is fingerprint reader (ha, ha) but with this price tag?. The last thing I can say is YOU MUST BUY IT !!! 310$ dollars for laptop which is better then Mac Air !!! The price of this thingy is absolutely insane. BUY IT, BUY IT BUY IT\n",

      "This is a great laptop especially when I added 4gb of ram and a Samsung ssd 860 evo. The speed on this thing now is amazing!! It takes 15 seconds from the time I turn it on till it is up and running. What I did was set my laptop up like a desktop. I bought a 23 inch Acer monitor and turned the display down on the laptop and placed it on my sliding keyboard drawer. So now I have a laptop/desktop computer at less than 500 dollars. I did a lot of research before buying this laptop and it paid off. Once again you will need to at least add 4gb of ram in the open slot which is incredibly easy to do.\n",

      "This laptop is amazing! I researched and watched reviews and compared....and settled on this and couldn’t be happier!! It turns On and off soooo fast! It does everything fast! It’s so light. I love the clicky feel o the keyboard and the backlit keys are handy. It’s lightweight and the battery life is impressive.I agree with others who say the volume is super low. Very true. But I just use a blue tooth speaker or headphones.\n",

      "Wonderful, if you add an SSD and more ram.  If you feel comfortable opening it, go for this laptop.  Just know you need to invest in more to make this useable. But, when you do, you will be amazed. It's a phenomenal little thing. I put a Samsung SSD and Kingston RAM and its flying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only received two stars for the fast shipping. I ordered this laptop as my work computer. Shipping was pretty fast. When delivered the amazon box was fine but the Acer box the laptop came in was damaged. I thought no big deal as long as laptop is fine. Well the top right side of the laptop has a dent in it. Unfortunately I haven’t even turned it in because now I’m shipping it back and will hopefully receive a replacement soon. I’ll update this review once I receive the replacement!!\n",

      "Bought this laptop for online school (and started using it for other things too). Was looking for a solid laptop at an affordable price and I got it. Things I've noticed since I got it a few weeks ago:- the speakers are horrible. If you want to stream movies and shows, then be prepared to be constantly using headphones. If there is AC or a fan on in your place, you won't be able to hear anything even at 100% volume. Even without a fan on, it's still as if the characters in the shows are whispering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me start off by saying I absolutely love this laptop. The high resolution screen is amazing. The colors are very defined, black is actually black..and not that faded off-black colors most computers have. The laptop itself is very fast and responsive. I love the backlight on the keyboard..I saw some people complaining that the backlight will turn off if you're not touching the keyboard, but that's for battery saving purposes, so it's fine. The S mode Windows 10 can easily be changed to regular Windows 10 within seconds by going to the settings..so it's no big deal. Battery life could be better, but it's still good. I gave four stars because the Caps Lock feature is tricky at first.. there is no light to let you know if Caps Lock is on or not. And the touchpad could more stable and sturdy, it is a little lose on the sides. But don't let that deter you from buying this laptop, you won't regret it.\n",

I eventually realized that this laptop ONLY works in Microsoft S Mode meaning you can't download anybody else's apps ever. Even tech support didn't know that.  Talk about creating a monopoly. Do not let Microsoft get away with this never buy a device that only works in Microsoft/Googles fascist monopoly. Remember Google is the company that wrote the search engine for China that allows them to track every chinese citizen and arrest them if the say anything against the State. FYI came with Camera and Microphone enable by default so they could view and listen to me from day one from any number of preloaded apps.\n",

      "The other reviewers were right the screen is awesome. Not too bad in setting it up. Really like the wifi installed. It really helped in setting up with the printer and all. Didn't have a Microsoft account so took a little time in setting it up. For the money the features of this laptop are really nice.\n",

      "I was hesitant to get this because it seemed like one of those \"You get what you pay for\" products. I got it on Black Friday so the price was even lower.  I've had it for about 4 days now and so far I'm pretty happy with it. I already have a primary desktop computer, so this was mostly to have something extra when I travel or to carry with me to work, etc. I don't plan to do anything major with this computer. Speakers aren't great either.The one thing that raised a red flag was during the initial set up, the computer froze on me. Right out the box. It gave me a scare. It's working now...no issues since. I will update if that changes.\n",

      "I docked one star for the sound. Doesn’t seem to be loud at all, but for the price I bought some Bluetooth speakers. The computer itself is lightweight and really easy to set up and use. I’m very pleased. I don’t play computer games so I can’t give an opinion on that. I’m using it for social media bs, watching Netflix/Hulu, and work. So far, so good!\n",

I added 8Gb of 2666MHz because that was recommended. It down-clocked to 2400MHz. Also, be aware that the Vega GPU takes part of the system memory. Windows shows 10GB usable out of 12GB because 2GB are now dedicated to the GPU. Runs VirtualBox with no problem once out of S mode.\n",

      "I am in a long distance relationship so all I really use this laptop for is Skype, internet use, and Netflix. It's a step up from my 5 year old laptop, but not by much; you get what you pay for. Screen quality and speed are good, the built-in webcam is about the same as my old laptop, but unfortunately the speakers are worse...Sound quality is fine but I have to have the laptop volume as well as the application volume (YouTube, Skype, etc.) all the way up to hear decently well. My last laptop was a Dell and around the same budget price point as this one, so I was hoping for a bit better quality seeing as this laptop is brand new. Maybe I'll invest in a headset to go along with it.\n",

      "Speedy and clean. Easy to configure, though S-mode is useful to only a very limited set of users.  Think of S-mode as Windows 10 Chromebook.

When I got no support from Acer, they kindly worked for me to return the item.Second comment: The laptop battery never charged or retained a charge from the first day I received it.  So I had issues with a brand new laptop from day one.  Acer customer service was not helpful at all or supportive.  They did not respond to my phone calls and their solution was for me to send it back for repair (which would take over two weeks).  I would never purchase anything from Acer again.\n",

      "Great product, amazing productivity laptop, easy to carry and easy to use. Upgrades can be done to it very easy and all the hardware is included, having an NVMe Ssd is a nice + as the system and application load time is super fast, with an extra 29.99 you can add a secondary but mechanical 1tb hardrive and with the included hardware instalation is a breeze.\n",

      "I have had this computer for about a month now and everything is working great. I had everything transferred from my old computer and it went smoothly. I like the keyboard lighting up around the keys when the light is dim. The only downside I had was having to buy a new wireless mouse as it would not recognize or accept my corded mouse from the other computer. Not sure if it was just the brand of mouse I had or why it kept rejecting it. Nice computer overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "I searched for quite awhile and chose this laptop. It was very easy to set up. The quality of the screen, keyboard is great. For someone who only uses it for word documents, photos and internet surfing, maybe some other business, no streaming or gaming, this is the one. Affordable.\n",

      "A wonderful computer for the price.  My first Acer and hands down it is far superior to any Dell or HP laptop I have owned.  Size is great and the overall appearance, performance and operation of  this laptop is fabulous.  You will be pleasantly surprises if you opt to purchase one.\n",

      "This laptop is shipped with Windows 10 in S mode.  This was fine with me as I planned to run Linux on it.  After much wrestling with Acer support, though, this computer does not have a BIOS option to boot to anything but Windows.  Support suggested that I flash the BIOS to get another boot option, but at this point, I would like nothing more than to return the laptop. Unfortunately, the return period just expired and that is no longer an option.\n",

      "Y'all, this Acer laptop is a million times better than the Dell laptop I owned that cost 4x as much. It is very quick and responsive, easy to personalize, the screen is huge, it's slim, and the keyboard has so many functions it makes me squeal a little bit. I'm telling everyone I know to buy one. Now I'm telling you. Just buy it. You won't be a sad panda.\n",

      "Overall, very good laptop for basic needs.  Camera and screen very clear and vibrant.  Came with Windows 10 S mode, tried it for a few days, but wanted google programs that were allowed, thus removed S mode.  No change in performance since getting out of S mode.  Very quick start up and response time.  Lighter then other laptops with similar side screens.  Only downside is getting used to th placement of the side keypad, button layout is slightly different than most keyboards.\n",

      "By far this is the best personal laptop I have used in my entire life. I bought this for my son originally but when I lost my job during COVID situation I had to resort to borrow this back from him. I have been using this since several months now. I am amazed with the performance screen quality. Sound quality is good. Max volume is Ok. I'm hoping to buy another one during July4th sale and would gift this back to my son. This is worth every penny and I am so happy with this purchase. It light weight, sleek and sexy.  I hate HP, Dells now. Lenovo is Ok, but didn't expect Acer to be this great!\n",

      "This is a surprisingly solid laptop. I was able to add a ssd in the empty expansion bay. Search on YouTube there's instructions on how. As well as another 4gb stick of DDR4 ram. Being able to upgrade a budget laptop to perform more like a mid-range laptop is always a plus. The laptop feels snappy and responsive. Applications boot up quickly. I strongly recommend disabling Windows S mode which isn't difficult. The speakers on this laptop are typical laptop speakers. You'll probably want to use a headset or external speakers.Pros: 1080p Screen, backlit keyboard, upgradable ram and storage, not heavy but doesn't feel cheap either. Decent battery life.\n",

I have many photo editing and guitar amp software so I decided to bite the bullet and try the Windows 10 which I'm not happy about. I'm totally happy with the computer, I just don't like MS spying on me out of principle, so it will see limited use while I run my Lenux Mint laptop for everyday internet stuff...much more secure at about 1/4 the size, you can actually run MInt off a USB stick\n",
      "\n",
      "Had to switch out the Windows 10 S but other than that, I really like the computer.  It is very quick, the battery life is good 7-8 hours generally.

Very happy with this affordable purchase and it is much lighter than my last laptop.\n",

      "This laptop sucks, don't waste your time. It is so slow, sometimes I try to do something and a I can NEVER get to it because the laptop won't process it. Some websites never fully load, I'll literally only see half of a webpage. At first it was just slow, but I thought well you get what you pay for. This is like dial up slow now. I tried to open up google chrome and it (no exaggeration) took 10 minutes -just to open. I tried to check my email and it crashed. I don't use this laptop to game, for social media, streaming, nothing like that. All I wanted it for was basic school and work stuff. The webcamera was trash but that was to be expected. I tried to make a video call to test it out.... garbage. You click something and nothing happens, no loading symbol, nothing. So you click again, then you wait a minute or two and click again, repeat, nothing. 10 minutes from your last click you have 20 pages opening at the same time and the laptop crashes. I am still just trying to check my email. Wish I would have returned it when I had the chance. Also this review just asked me to rate the touch screen... Is this supposed to be touch screen? It's not. Speakers might as well not even be there. I sifted through tons of reviews for so many laptops!  If anyone has any tips to make this thing more user friendly PLEASE HELP. 300 may not be a lot for a laptop but it is too much for me to just throw away.\n",

I've searched on the acer site and various other sites and reinstalled the the trackpad drivers.  Nothing.  I had to buy a mouse to plug in to use this.  So it's not good for use when you fly or travel.  Also, you can't get access to change or remove the battery.  It's basically a disposable computer.  Starts up quickly.  Serves the general purpose.\n",

Literally, you press the power button and within 5 secs it's ready to take your login credentials and as soon as that's done, it's ready to go immediately.

Not enough memory for all the junk residual that Windows program stores, especially if you escape the Microsoft search engine only restrictive setting that does seem to avoid malware.

I did not have any problems connecting any of my other devices to the wifi including the old laptop that I was replacing. When I could get this computer to connect, I could not be more than a few feet away from the router. I have it fixed now and am able to use the laptop for my basic needs (surfing the web and opening up files) but it has been really annoying having to deal with getting this computer to connect to the wifi plus windows 10s.\n",

The only complaint I have is that the volume is SO low on it, even at max volume, I can barely hear the sound when my heating or air kicks on. That is unfortunate because I bought the laptop to stream videos on... I have learned to either connect my own speakers or headphones, otherwise it's impossible to hear the volume. That said, I didn't pay much for it, and I will take it the way it is!\n",

I use it for my real estate career, I'm an agent, and love that the picture is so clear you can literally count blades of grass. My clients will be impressed. It's sleek and seems durable although I'm a grown woman so I won't be too hard on it. Acer is a good economical Choice. My 5 year old one used daily, very heavy usage saved a million things, just too heavy and started having issues with the mouse. I will likely still use it at home for my kids.\n",

Any time a game would have more that a bare minimum of processing, the entire laptop would immediately shut down. Star wars the old republic (an over 10 year old game mind you) would not get past character creation. I returned it after a full wipe and reinstall. I personally will not buy another Acer product.\n",

We will see what they say in ten days...…  If not covered, I will not authorize them to repair it. Hopefully, I can update this to state they support their products but only time will tell.\n",

I usually go for quality brands but I had to make adjustments because my life went downhill- ANYWAY, first impression is good. Nicely boxed. As soon as you turn on the computer there is a voice walkthrough to setup your computer (which is cool, I'm used to setting up myself). Screen is awesome. Sharp. Product hardware is nice and light weight. It's good for basics to moderate use. Battery life is a lil low but it's a big screen- it's to be expected. I leave it plugged in most of the time anyway. I don't recommend hardcore gaming. Get a gaming console instead. Personally I dont use the Windows S mode, it's not compatible with the apps I wanted to run so I switched out (Note to self: Once u change u cant change back).

It's necessary to say that I bought and additional of 8gb ram, the computer has 4gb, and a free slot, making a total of 12gb, I installed it since day one, so I don't know if the 4gb are enough, I just bought the additional ram to make it a little bit faster.\n",

Storage is sub-par, (though clearly identified.) the backspace key works 70 percent of the time, making 30 percent of typing aggravating. And still, with Windows (I know, another company, but you can't escape Windows) it WILL NOT download all the photos off an iPhone. I mean, how basic is that? But avoid using this laptop for any serious software, avoid using it to grab your phone photos, and avoid using it to play podcasts or youtube videos anything with speaking, or music, and it's a zippy and portable keyboard.

Amazing.I bought this as a cheap travel laptop, but it will likely remain my primary laptop until I have a need for more speed/processing power.

I bought this for school and playing old 2D games, and I recommend buying another stick of ram because there is an open slot. Extra ram will make the Vega 3 graphics work better than any intel graphics. I whipped out 110fps from this thing on CSGO, turned most things to low and resolution to 720p. League of legends runs on here at max settings at 1080p. The screen is also nice and crisp, has the antiglare matte IPS panel. Overall a great machine for $315.

I love that the screen comes with rich colors and saturation, not many can say about most moderate gaming laptops these days. I did how ever notice some audio cues and problems with this device, it doesn't seem to have any base to it, so anything with higher pitch just cuts out. There is no optical drive at all or any possibility of installing a future optical drive as their is no slots for it. It is a great laptop for those who would want to do moderate gaming. It has a nice feel to it and key board that is backlit, so you  can use it in the dark. The screen is eye friendly as you can turn down brightness to your choosing. It does however have S installed on it but can be easily be unlocked by the windows store or just by updating it manually from the windows updates in system menu. The Vega graphics are awesome a specially only being clocked at 1100 megahertz, so playing anything moderate is great.\n",

      "It’s not the fastest laptop by any means. Upgraded the ram to double the amount out of the box amount with the suggested Samsung ram. Fairly easy to do if your savvy around that sort of stuff. The bottom of the laptop is plastic and bends and flexes easily. Be careful prying it open to upgrade  ram. My son used it for home school and is sufficient once out of s-mode. That’s fairly easy to navigate out of with some research online. I’d rate it 3.5/5. The battery life is exceptional. The charger is really cheap and flimsy. That’s why I’m docking it points.\n",

There are many guides on how to activate your copy of windows and deactivate S mode.If you are lookin for a laptop that will do all that it should and more, at this price point ($0-$600) this is your best bet. Build quality is outstanding. Has all the bells and whistles .If you budget is on the higher end you may want to pick up this same model with the Core-i5 for $509.00. Either way Acer made a great computer here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably the best bang for the buck in laptops out there. I have been in the computer business for almost 25 years. Nothing has come along like this.IPS screen is so much better than what most offer for this price. Honestly just go and buy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't review purchases very often, but I felt I had to add myself to the long list of happy owners. I am not a gamer,so I can't attest to its ability to do games, but it does everything I do better than my Dell, which has 8g memory -  faster startup, faster web browsing, faster everything. Great screen resolution, nice keyboard, nice and light.\n",

      "Had one Aspire 5 with Ryzen 7 last year with good experience so bought this new model with Ryzen 7.  So far everything is ok.  Light games play is flawless. Added additional memory and ssd drive.  The kid loves it.\n",

      "I just got my ACER today.  However, the screen at 1080p is an amazing first impression.  The speed of this laptop is top notch as well.  Very responsive.  I do a lot of trading chart work.  Charts are resource intensive and they load with no problem on this baby!  Super Happy about this purchase!  Oh, the mini number pad is a nice touch as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that this is not a gaming computer but some low end games should be able to be played on in with settings adjusted just fine. My sister plays minecraft on it with no problems and with the SSD it has great boot up speed. No complaints with this setup at all!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the laptop is great quality for this price range. I was able to install Linux Mint 19  and have it dual boot with Windows 10. Linux Mint 19 Mate was great and I upgraded the Linux Kernel to the latest one and it runs even better. Oracle Virtual Box to have Linux VMs. It is working great!Pros:\n",
      "\n",
      "This laptop is a little rockstar. My main purpose was for college (blackboard, google drive, proctored testing) and it handles all that well. Then COVID happened and my work moved to the home. This laptop is powering at one time: my college work, multiple email accounts, windows, streaming meetings, plus I have a VPN portal to access my work computer on a second monitor attached to this thing. It has been well worth the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been using this laptop for several hours per day since getting it about two months ago and have had no problems with it since. It boots fast as expected with an SSD, and runs everything that I need for college perfectly. This was one of the cheapest (and best) options I found for a laptop that included a Ryzen CPU, and am extremely happy with my purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoy this laptop. I've always been scared of ever purchasing one due to past experiences, but this one has a good sweet spot. Other than getting it out of Windows 10S mode and adding an extra 4gb ram stick (which you NEED TO DO, the amount of ram that I use on the regular surpasses the 4gb default included in the computer) it runs like butter. The keys feel nice and tactile (not to mention LIGHT UP, great for dark lecture halls), and the mousepad is nice as well. Even the battery life is fantastic, as long as you don't have it running full load with the screen brightness at 100% the whole time. Under moderate use and with power saver on, I get a good 6 hours of battery life. Beware though, this laptop really isn't made for gaming or anything like that, so just stick to office/school work, browsing and streaming.So far, it's great. Now all we have to see is how well it lasts to time....\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had it for over a month and am super stoked! It is heavy and study and that's what I wanted. This tough, slick, stylish computer is fabulous! The keys feel like silky butter under my fingers. The HD screen is lively and the depth is mesmerizing! The sound is great. It's very fast! Couldn't be happier!\n",

The speakers are very quiet and the webcam isn't very good (who knew that would matter until COVID and suddenly regularly using video chats) but its otherwise been pretty good.A few days ago it stopped booting up entirely.  Just gets to the Acer screen and a spinning wheel which goes on indefinitely (left it on for 5-6 hours without any change).  Tried to get to a repair mode or safe mode but that hasn't worked either.  Created a windows USB to reinstall or repair that way, but it won't boot.  I looked into what to do and I've changed the bios settings to disable secure boot and allow a USB to boot from, but it still doesn't work.  Really frustrating to have a useless computer in less than a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a great machine, though cheap so maybe you can't expect much. The battery is poor. Even with no activity the battery runs down in less than a day.Pretty much have to add more memory to do much of anything at all. That negates the low price.\n",
      "\n",
      "this is a good laptop, it is fast to boot up and fast over all, ive had some problems with it but thats probably just because of 4gb of ram , its not too heavy and the screen is goodi do play games on it, i play CSGO with low graphics but it runs good, and i play minecraft with shaders\n",

      "I originally bought a chrome book for my college-age son, but it wouldn't allow him to download software program needed for a class.  So I bought this and I will say the color and picture is amazing with the IPS.  My son loves this new computer and the sturdiness of the aluminum shell, since he tends to bang the laptop around a little while it's in his backpack.  As a side note, I had to uninstall the Microsoft Windows 10S because it wouldn't allow the software needed for my son's class.  I only worry if 4GB of memory is enough down the road.  I do recommend this laptop.\n",

      "This is a good laptop at a good price. The lighted keys are a plus. Lacks a touchscreen but that is in the specs. Loads very quickly with the SSD boot drive but the drive is very small and you may have to add a drive if you have a lot of pictures and files. The only problem I had is adding a secondary hard drive. I have worked with Acer and Western Digital Customer Service, ordered what I was told would work, but the connectors would not match up. Amazon did take the drive I ordered back. I am  now going to try the SSD option, but I will have more money in this laptop than I would if I had I got one with more storage ad memory. If you will need more storage, this is something you should consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "im not sure if touchscreen was listed but there is none :( for gaming this laptop is okay, has a big clear screen but sometimes doesnt function right. came in great and fresh with everything clean! sometimes the sound bugs out which is kind of frustrating but over all the laptop is good and big for a cheap price :)\n",
      "\n",
      "Bad. I’ve had this for a little over a month and so can’t return it to Amazon, but it’s already broken (screen display issue probably) and have to arrange to pack it up and mail it to Acer to be fixed. Considering throwing it in the trash along with the full price I paid for it\n",
      "\n",
      "I needed a laptop with a faster CPU to work from home. I attend and host many virtual conferences that require video and screen sharing. This laptop is by far the best I've ever owned. It is super fast. I experienced no delays at all while presenting.  I do wish that I would have got one with a larger screen , it seems a bit smaller than stated but other than that I love it. I have recommended it to others already.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an awesome computer for the price. Super fast Solid State hard drive makes it boot up instantly. No bloatware or unnecessary virus software installed. Comes with built in Microsoft anti virus software and firewall, which is now highly rated, so no annual anti-virus fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not a computer whiz and only use this for emails, Zoom, Excel and such.  I saw a review that claimed the screen wasn't crisp and clear but I think it's fine.  For the price it's a great value for the occasional user.\n",
      "\n",

The # is no longer in use, and the Windows 10 license will expire within days.  Each time I try to use Word or excel I just keep getting pop ups to buy a new version and mine will go offline in days.  Scammed\n",
      "\n",
      "The laptop itself is ok, however for many apps I need, Windows is asking to upgrade the system to be able to use apps like Zoom or to download browsers like Chrome, and the upgrade costsmoney an extra $100 plus. I can only use Microsoft Edge for browsing unless I pay more to get out of S mode whatever that is, Microsoft edge not being the best browser at all, give me Microsoft Explorer vibes, and I can’t accomplish all I need to do with it. Feeling frustrated and considering just saving for a Mac book instead of paying for an “Upgrade.” Unfortunately I may have to end it paying because in order to work efficiently, I have to get out of S mode. I’m not happy with having with the S mode and all the restrictions. Then I final paid for the update, so I could get out of S mode, and now I have Windows 10 pro S mode instead, trying to get out of that S mode even paying the upgrade, and Microsoft is making it so difficult, so basically paid for the upgrade and it’s not letting me switch out of S mode, without a fight, what a joke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting this new laptop from Acer was like a breath of fresh air compared to my old one. This laptop is fast because it uses a SSD instead of a HDD, but the downside is it comes with less storage. I really like how light it is as it was what I needed since I'm a college student and I need to take it wherever I go. As for gaming I haven't tested it out but I don't think this laptop was made for gaming considering the small storage it comes with. The screen is flawless and sharp which is pleasant to look at when watching YouTube videos. The battery life of 7 hours was a big improvement compared to only 4 hours on my old one. Overall if you need a laptop to do the basic things of internet browse, use apps like Microsoft Office this is just for you. Also if you are on the fence on getting it because of the specs the other reviews have stated that this laptop it is easily up-gradable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great laptop for the money! Little lacking on the Ram and Hard drive but easily upgraded. It's almost as if Acer expected you to upgrade as they include all the hardware need to install a second drive. I added another 4GB of ram and a 500GB SSD hard drive, links below ($85.00). Nice screen, 1080P! Well worth the money!https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073SBZ8YH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n",

He's contacted customer support and had the issue fixed for a bit but it came back.  He cannot hear anything from his headphones. But the sound works fine from the computer speaker,  just not from the audio jack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality construction. Feels solid and classy. Screen looks great, although bends with pressure. Speakers sound great, not quite my girlfriends' $2800 Macbook Pro speakers, but absolutely fantastic on a budget laptop. Clean OS install with minimal bloatware. Easy to switch out of S-Mode. I recommended adding a $25 4GB stick of RAM to utilize the Ryzen chip's dual channel technology. Not complex, but be cautious pulling off the back panel as bending it too much can cause it to break.Probably the only issue I've encountered is that the touch pad is really finicky. I use a wireless mouse, not a deal-breaker for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am used to having the crappy quality laptops and not researching before I buy, I chose this $350 computer over a $600 one. I am not upset at that! The screen quality is superb with the OLED screen! I added 8 GB of RAM to help speed it up but I am not sure I even needed to do that. My only complaint is the speakers. They are really bad and I need to hold it up to my ear to hear or it in my Bluetooth headphones. Overall I would definitely buy again!\n",
      "\n",
      "I got this laptop for less than $300 during prime day, but could easily justify spending full price ($320 last I saw) for this laptop. It has everything you need and nothing you don't the SSD is fast, and the minimalist design simplifies things and doesn't give you features you probably wont use (CD drive, touchscreen, etc) I may add additional RAM in the future, but as it sits now it does everything I need it to (and fast) for streaming, browsing and general computing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buy it ... you'll love it.  I'm not a gamer nor do I watch movies on the laptop.  Easy setup. Easy to switch from S mode to Windows Home.  Loads really fast.  The arrangement of the keypad is a little different than my HP but like with anything new there is a learning curve so I'm sure the adjustment will be easy.  If you use the ctrl-home key combination (I use it a lot in Word and Excel) you have to first take your num locks off so it really isn't a short cut.  Backlit keypad and the display are great.Most of the reviews I had read were 5 stars.  For the most part I felt the bad reviews were from people that were trying to do things that the laptop was not built to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The top right corner of the screen has a bright white spot where the backlight is too bright. On a black wallpaper everything is solid black except for that one corner. I almost returned it because of that but decided it's not worth the trouble.\n",

      "Purchased for my wife.  She uses it for work.  Zero complaints!  Battery life is fantastic.  I hardly see her plug it in. (Disclaimer:  it is treated like our phones....battery run down to low before charging)Would recommend to anyone.  Official reviews have it right about this Laptop.\n",

      "We bought this laptop as a present for our daughter for school.  Within 3 months one of the letters on the keyboard came off.  I called and the first person I spoke with was of no help at all and then asked me to call back in.  The second person I spoke with said that we would have to ship the laptop back in to them to look at for repair (we are in a quarantine right now and can't just go without a laptop).  If we did ship it back I was then informed that if they ended up having to replace the keyboard it come out of our pocket.  Are you kidding me???? A 3 month old laptop ad WE will have to pay the repairs.  Never buying another ACER again.  SO DISSAPPOINTED with the laptop and customer service.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got this computer for my programming classes at college and occasional superlight gaming and I would say I am very surprised with the performance and quality of this laptop. The color of the laptop is great and looks fantastic and the hardware performance is better than I expected and for the price, you could really not ask for anymore. I would say get this if you are in a budget and need a light and solid machine for a little more of daily task.\n",
      "\n",
      "This laptop is an amazing buy to start getting into light video editing, photo editing and light gaming.You can max out this computer at 32 GB of ram and buy a 1TB+ of storage and add it yourself (if you don’t know how a quick YouTube vid will help).\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not a gaming laptop as the price shoulllllld suggest. HOWEVER, This thing does surprising well on some older titles. World of Warcraft runs on medium at 40 FPS, and older titles run flawlessly.  The SSD is super fast to boot and navigate windows, there is not a lot of bloat ware, anddddd You can upgrade the ram and install another Hard Drive!  I am amazed how cheap and good this is, another 500$ on a gaming laptop simply gets you more frames per second, and hardly seems worth it unless u are a true gamer.\n",
      "\n",
      "This little machine is perfect. So thin, light, with enough ports (the expandable ethernet port is ADORBS), crisp HD screen, AND a backlit keyboard! The sound quality was a nice surprise - it has a decent amount of bass for tiny speakers, and the sound expands out like magic. What is this sorcery?? What's the catch? The aluminum top feels a bit flimsy, and there could be more RAM, but for the price, it's quite impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "No disclosure of \"S\" mode!  NO disclosure that you cannot download COMMON software.  I detest this PC!  Will never buy a computer online again!  Once you open the box you cannot return it!  DID I MENTION I HATE THIS STUPID LAPTOP??????  What a gross waste of my money!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially I wasn't a fan of Windows 10 Safe Mode, but now I love it.  The computer is clean and fast - not clogged up.  It boots up in 3 seconds and shuts down completely in less than 5 seconds.  I travel with it quite a bit and find it easy to carry in my backpack.  The bonus 15.4\" screen gives me a nice view of my documents, PowerPoints and spreadsheets.  The solid state drive is fast and quiet - use external flash drives for saving stuff.  The compact keyboard takes some getting used to, but is no problem.  The number  pad which contain the function keys is 3/5ths the size of a standard numpad, so you have to turn NumLock off and on, but that is no problem once you get used to it.  The laptop is sturdy, thin and neat to look at.  I like it a lot and use it nearly every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "You won’t find these specs and build quality on another machine for this price. It’s lightweight, fast, screen is great from just about any angle. The 128gb SSD offers plenty of internal storage.Only 3 very minor complaints - I’d love to have seen a USB-C charging, uses standard 12v DC. There isn’t an SD card reader, would be a nice option, but it’s very easy to take the bottom off and upgrade the SSD and RAM. Lastly, this thing comes loaded with extra programs pre-installed, so you’ll want to run a Windows Refresh to get rid of all that before you install anything. Then you can install only the apps and programs you’ll use and keep it nice and fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "The laptop just arrived today and when I pulled it out of the box i noticed a huge scratch on the cover. I called Acer and spent 40 minutes with 2 different people. Neither of them spoke English as a native language and couldn't seem to understand what I was saying. The only option they gave me was to ship the laptop back to them and it will take 7 to 10 days to fix it once they get it. I would have to pay for this as it is not covered under warranty.\n",

      "Can't beat the $310 price point for this laptop. You get a very good piece of hardware (lightweight & portable, very fast boot, great screen and keyboard, ok trackpad). Invested an additional $80 to add a 250GB SATA SSD (brings the laptop to 378GB total hard drive) and 8GB RAM (12GB RAM total), which I think were necessary upgrades. The upgrades were fairly easy to do at home and the Acer youtube video on the SSD upgrade was very helpful. Ended up with an amazing laptop, all under $400.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solid laptop for the price. Battery life seems pretty mediocre, it feels like I have to charge often and the laptop will sometimes shut off unexpectedly at 10% battery. The speakers are HORRIBLE. I watch Netflix and it sounds like the characters are literally whispering. The functionality of the laptop is great and overall I’m pleased due to the price, you get what you pay for but my goodness the low speaker volume can be a nuisance.\n",

Pages and programs load super fast too. I love the backlit keyboard, and it has an excellent HD screen. It costs less than the crappy laptops I replaced. The only thing I would change is the 10 key pad. It's compressed, and takes some getting used to. Overall, highly recommend for the money.\n",

They conference me in with Acer who confirm warranty. They said I was 2nd in queue and would be 5 -10 minutes. After 54 minutes AMazon said someone from Acer would call me back. Of course I never got that call either. THis laptop is low quality and  you cannot get a repair or support so stay away because as soon as you have a problem Acer is of no help.\n",

      "Very nice bare bones laptop. I’m not planning on playing games so it works great for file handling, videos and internet access. You might not choose to, but I added an ssd and more memory. The laptop shipped with mounting for the ssd and there is a tutorial video on Acer’s website. It boots very quickly. The computer is lightweight and may not the choice for someone that is rough on equipment. Seems like the lid/screen is flexible so I open it with care.Best Wishes!\n",

Didn't notice it at first but I was trying to watch on fb my son's schools live video on opening or keeping up distant learning and I couldn't hear it! The volume was all the way up and it still wasn't loud enough had to switch over to my phone to listen in on the meeting.  Hoping I can figure out a way to fix this without having to add speakers since I'd like this to be very portable so my child can do school work on the couch or in his bedroom. Adventure academy was loud enough but now I'm wondering if I will have issues with him doing video calls with his teachers.\n",

For gaming it’s able to run the games I play in stable low-medium quality, the fan goes off a bit loud but for me personally it’s not a big deal, nor is it distracting. For 8 gb of ram only 6 is available but I’m planning on upgrading and adding another 8 gb sometime in the future. For media and entertainment, I use it to watch movies on streaming sites and the quality is very good, no backlight bleed at all during dark screens but results might vary for others.

      "I purchased this laptop in December 2019 and it constantly freezes up. I typically utilize it for surfing the web and ocasionally checking emails.  After about a month of use, I noticed it would freeze up but ignored it since I did not use it very often. Now that I’m working from home basically doing the same thing, except utilizing MS Excel and MS Word more often, I noticed it would freeze up after about 45 minutes to an hour of use. I must then restart it via the power button. No other functions work.  I upgraded the RAM to 16 Gigs thinking it would improve but it did not. There is still a significant amount of HD space available (40+ Gigs) and no unknown source apps installed. This is the worst laptop I ever had. Its frustrating to constantly stop and start your work.

It's perfect for school and start up small business deployment. My only complaint were drivers on the Acer website. The Windows update were newer than the ones for download. However, its not really a downer since it can be resolved in the background during Windows update. Overall, its a great value, and NOT everything has to be Intel.\n",

      "Boy what a sweet laptop for just a little cash. Nice fit and finish, like backlit keyboard, touch pad is bit too sensitive. Beware it’s UEID boot with no option to change, so you’re stuck with the SSD drive. You can add a 2.5” SATA HDD, but it’s not bootable? WIN-10 S stands for sucks! You can change that easily. Overall for the price it’s a good little laptop for my average use (I use tablet or phone way more than laptop)\n",

I contacted Acer for support 3 times in less than 24 hours. It temporarily was fixed for 3 hours and then stopped working again. They said I would need to mail my laptop to them (with the cost being on me even though it is under warranty) and they would have it back to me in 20 days. I don't feel safe mailing my computer with all of my personal info on it to someone to have for almost 3 weeks, so I guess I have to keep it with a non working mouse/touchpad. Buyer beware. You get what you pay for.\n",

There is a open slot for memory. I got a 16Gb chip and added it in. So, now it has 20Gb of memory. This laptop feels well made and light weight. It boots up in about 5 seconds. For the money i think you would be very hard pressed to find a better laptop! Paid $269 on Prime day. Note: it does not have a touch screen. Also, if you want you could clone / image and put in a larger SSD drive. But i keep all my data on a seperate drive so the 128Gb SSD is fine.\n",

I looked into it and the OS will reserve ram for itself.\n",

      "Originally gave this review one star, believing the charging port on the laptop had failed. However, ordering a new charger for $20 for this exact model fixed the issue. The connection on the charger itself is what was worn, not the laptop charging port on the laptop itself, thank goodness. Otherwise like the laptop for the money. The touchpad was oversensitive out of the box, but reducing the sensitivity in windows mostly fixed this issue, which also can depend on the weather and amount of static in the air.\n",

It is excellent for streaming, and I have been using SAI with great success. The laptop can run Sims 4 without issue although I would be hesitant to try running a heftier game such as ARK on it.The one thing that has me worried is that occasionally what looks like a green dot grid will appear in patches or over the whole visible screen. It always goes away, but it is concerning. I'm going to see if updating some graphics drivers fixes the issue.\n",

For the ~300 price range, you can't go wrong with this product!\n",

With the wireless mouse that I also bought with it, it is easy to use and very convenient.  I can't say how long the battery lasts yet but, for my immediate purposes, everything has been great to date.  No regrets at all.

When my kids are writing papers on google documents, the mouse does NOT work. It takes forever to type and fix things because it forces you to use arrows instead.  The C key is stubborn and you often have to slam it hard to make it work. The WORST part is that this useless computer will not connect to the printer. I have never had this problem before with any other computer.  Any google search shows this computer must have google chrome to try to connect to our printer....but this piece of garbage will NOT allow me to even down load google chrome!!!!!

The laptop comes with a 128gb m.2 NvMe data hard drive which windows and preinstalled software takes about 40gigs of it.

I tried calling costumer support and the person only told me to do 1 thing (out of the 3 that I found on acer’s community blog) and since it didn’t work (again) informed that I have to send it for repair...fine but what about the fact that is a less than a year old device?, not over used, used only for studying, I mean.... Also all the important information that I have there is apparently lost forever, studying material, e-courses and guides that costed money, sensitive information, etc., and what am o supposed to do with my studying now?

It is important to note however, that this product comes with built in S Mode which restricts some of the apps you may want to download that are not affiliated with Microsoft (Google Chrome for example). Once you turn this off, you can never turn it back on again in this computer version. Furthermore, I may just be an idiot, but even after doing research I could not find a way to keep the keyboard backlight on. It turns off after a short period of nonuse.

This computer costs $350 so I'll make my money back in three months!  Set up was incredibly easy.  Taking the computer out of S mode took three minutes and was beyond easy.  Note:  I did have to wait for 20 minutes for the Microsoft Windows to activate to make the change.  The wireless connection to my TV means no wires to mess with and the picture is fantastic in HD!!

Please remember that it only has 4g of ram out the box... For a $300 pc that is upgradable, (which I’m about to do) I think is a steal. It’s a really nice, slick design, couldn’t be any happier.

Came with all the accessories as advertised, the unit is clean and very (I can't emphasis enough) easy to set it. It walks you through the basic set up, up and running within 20 minutes. I like the lite keyboard, and the screen is crisp and the blacks are deep and rich. Its not the fastest, but with additional RAM on its way it should move along nicely. Don't be shy with this model, its great for daily use or a student heading back to school. Best choice I could have made!\n",

The people at Acer were very helpful and the first time they knew exactly which keys on the keyboard to tap and how many times to tap them to get it to work. The second time they couldn't fix it like that but while I was waiting on the phone the pc fixed itself. I decided to send it back while that was still possible. Buying from Amazon really helps with that. Other than the touchpad, which is why I sent it back, there were other things that I really didn't like about the product when it was working. The sound volume is way too low (though headphones might have fixed that easily but I didn't have them then). There is no light on the 'caps lock' key to let you know you are capitalizing every letter. And that was often a problem. But if the touch pad had never stopped working I'd still have it. Glad though I don't. I bought a refurbished HP from Office Deport for $250 ($650 knock off!) and I paid a $70 fee to get a two year warranty to make me good about it.\n",

This is an ideal laptop for those who browse the internet, watch videos, or do any type of office work.  Watching YouTube and Netflix is very smooth at a high quality and the thin bezels, HD IPS Display, and anti glare, makes the viewing experience much more satisfying.In terms of gaming, the laptop is able to run some of the basic popular titles, however at 4gbs of ram and a weaker graphics card, you won't be able to play any high performing modern games. Adding another 4gb or 8gb of ram should do the trick. The laptop comes with a mere 118gb of space so I also recommend buying atleast a 120 gb SSD if you require more space.

They were very unreliable and just a notice for customers outside of the USA they simply do not care, as I explained my situation to them after spending my cash on their product, they stated that I had to pay to ship back to the US as they are not responsible for the fees concerned with shipping back to the US. PLEASE IF YOU KNOW YOU ARE LIVING OUTSIDE THE US. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON MAKING HUGE PURCHASES LIKE THIS ONE, THEY WILL DO NOTHING TO ASSIST YOU.\n",

      "Amazing laptop at a great price! This laptop punches above its weight in all categories. The full HD (IPS!! What!?!) display is gorgeous, deep blacks, bright, and vibrant with amazing viewing angles. The CPU is very capable for light productivity (web, accounting, word processing, etc. Last, upgradeability, something that is harder and harder to find these days, you can easily and cheaply upgrade the hard drive and RAM to keep this device running great for at least three years (amazing for any price point)\n",

      "We don't do any gaming but this has been a great upgrade from our last Acer, which it seems like we had forever (still going strong but we had to replace it cuz it had Windows 7). Screen quality is much improved & it's a lot faster to boot. Our last one was indestructible (only had to replace the battery), so I expect this one to do just as well. Great little laptop at a reasonable price.\n",

      "This is not an Amazon issue; its an Acer issue. After doing a lot of independent research, I purchased this laptop. I noticed the battery wasn't lasting as long as expected when not connected to power, so noticed that fully charged it measures just 3.25 hours when the spec indicated it would last up to 7.5-- and that's without power. When I called Acer Chat, she kept advising me of apps, and uses which drain the battery. After explaining, in writing, that this wasn't a battery use issue and getting the same feedback about draining apps/uses, I asked to be elevated. Apparently, elevating my chat wasn't available but someone would \"call wi/24 hours\". Although I am still waiting, I have already arranged to return the laptop.\n",

This laptop freaks out at least once every day trying to load a Youtube video or a even just a webpage by turning the page black for a few seconds. It constantly can't connect to the Wifi where every other device in the household does perfectly fine. It's so frustrating to use and if I had known, I would have spent more money on a better quality laptop so please don't waste your money on this. The issue has gotten worse since I first turned it on and I don't see this laptop lasting any longer than 1-2 years until it's unusable making it a big waste of money.\n",

      "Great little 'budget' rig. Got on Black Friday for $280 and it's worth every penny of that. Works fast, clear and bright screen, the timeout on the key back light is not long at all. Added a 1tb ssd for storage in the secondary drive spot (YouTube has a ton of videos for this process if you are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with opening up and adding a drive. It's super easy) and upgraded to 16gb of ram. Probably overkill on the ram but I had it already. You'd be fine with adding just a second 4gb stick. Works amazingly smooth. Could not be happier.\n",
      "\n",
      "After just a few days of use, I was positive this was an excellent choice for my use. It was easy to convert from the supplied W10-S to W-10 home operating system, the supplied cable and mount made it easy to add an additional SSD, and I also doubled the supplied RAM while I had it opened up. It replaced an older laptop that I use when I'm away from home, and is perfect for my current needs at an affordable price.\n",

      "Excellent unit! I’m a bit of an AMD fanboi, but I’m not kidding when I say this thing exceeded my expectations. I upgraded it to 16gb RAM and swapped out the NVME for a 1TB Intel 660p unit. My son came from a Sandy Bridge laptop with Intel integrated video. Some of his steam games couldn’t achieve playable frame rates. On this laptop, they do. Games like Subnautica, default settings and it just works.\n",

      "If you plan on using this for anything more than just browsing a few tabs, get some extra ram. It’s cheap enough and easy enough to install and you’ll be glad you did since 4gb is pretty pitiful. It has a nice screen and doesn’t feel as budget as many other laptops in this price range.The only major negative I can think of is the speakers. They don’t get even a quarter as loud as my old laptop, and since the speakers are on the bottom of the unit the already low volume sounds downright muffled and muted most of the time. Headphones are an absolute must of you plan on streaming.\n",

      "Great upgrade to my 2013 Dell Ispiron. I can actually use this computer for school because it is so light by comparison. The keyboard is easy to type on and the screen is very slim. I am worried tho that because it isn't as robust as my old laptop, that I may bend it or break the screen by carrying it around in my backpack. I am going to purchase a laptop sleeve for it as an extra layer of protection. Easy to upgrade and light.\n",

      "This is an excellent computer at an unbelievable price. Beautiful screen, nice backlit keyboard, light and fast. I have bought two of them, one for me and one for my 15 year old son. I maxed out the RAM on mine to 32 GB and my son's to 16GB. I also added a second SSD to both for extra storage. I am running both Windows 10 and Linux on mine. Very responsive system, fast browsing and can do some light gaming like Minecraft, Overwatch and I also run virtual machines and program on it. I would highly recommend this for anyone needing a primary or secondary computer.\n",

It started running in the middle of the night while closed and untouched for some time (or my kids we being very stealthy). The screen is very big, which is not bad, but makes it bulky as a portable computer. Screen quality and keyboard are fine, but lack elegance.\n",

      "I like just about everything about this laptop. I Love the back-lit keyboard. I like the fact is is light and it has an awesome display. I only gave it 4 stars because of the sound, it is very low. I ordered two of these and they are the same. Downloaded audio drivers for it but not much change. Overall very happy.\n",

      "At this point, one month since booting up, this ACER Aspire has been a great buy for just over $300.  Pleased by the quickness of loading and moving from application to application.  If you have data intensive requirements, then 128GB SDD memory would be a limitation.  If you need and use a number pad on the keyboard, note that the number pad on this keyboard is sort of scrunched up (smaller) than normal.  Ram comes with 4GB although is expandable.  Nice touch for the money in that screen is full HD (1080) and keyboard is back lit.  Although the screen viewing quality decreases significantly with the angle of view increasing.  Have not to this point tested battery life.  I am quite pleased with my purchase, especially at this price.\n",

Contact customer service via chat, opened warranty claim, all was good, then I received an email denying the claim as I had bought this on 7/23/2019.  Will never purchase an ACER nor recommend them.  Even worse, they did not even offer to fix item for a fee.  Does anyone want a paperweight?\n",

This is a great laptop. The only issue I'm having is that the apu steals memory from the computer so I'm dealing with 3.5 gb of DDR4 memory until my new stick arrives so I can expand the memory. Wonderful laptop, but 8gb of ram is basically vital in 2019.\n",

I've had several laptops and none of them gave me problems like this one. Spent a lot of time researching and thought I'd found a good laptop, but now stuck because by the time classes started and she really started using it, the return window and warranty were up.

      "There is nothing I don't like about this laptop. Although I thought the backlit keyboard was a eh feature, I really like it. I only have the four mg of ram and it is plenty for what I do. It is not a gaming computer but for basic first person shooter, it's fine. I had concerns about the screen brightness because of some reviews but I think the screen is plenty bright. It was the easiest computer I've ever owned to set up. The Windows S is pretty easy to turn off and you have windows 10. Nothing bad to say. Nothing to watch out for. Great Value.

I would not recommend it to Update: it crashed after only owning for 4 months, and they are making me pay the shipping to Texas to get it repaired even though it's still under warranty. I do not recommend this computer to anyone, or an Acer for that matter\n",

So I began I search for a new laptop and read a ton of reviews. Most of the reviews terrified me but, I kept coming back to this laptop.. which people said booted fast and ran smoothly. Word worked fast and so did every other program I launched. The color looked beautiful and the keys back light when you touch them. I can't believe how much it has for the money. Perfect for data entry or studying. If you need a computer for your office this is perfect.\n",

My brother recommended this brand and type so I ordered it and I am in love with this laptop!!!!It's lightweight, sleek, fast, big screen and most of all I love the color!! And the speakers are pretty good too. I work at home outside the porch and it does the trick, no need for an external speaker\n",

      "Overall pretty please with the performance and quality of this laptop. I wouldn't consider myself a power user so but I do play some older games such as diablo 2 and star craft which this platform handles seamlessly.

The bracket for this second hard drive is taped inside the case, you have to remove the bottom panel to get access to the components. If you do not want to open the laptop to upgrade at all, just note the single 4GB of RAM is fine for web browsing and running lightweight programs and some older games. If you put in an extra RAM stick, plus a 7mm thick SATA type hard drive, then you have a very cheap and decent multimedia laptop that can do tasks a bit faster than the stock configuration. For the money, and the option to upgrade later on down the line, this deal is very nice.\n",

It's a big computer and lightweight. It performs beautifully. It is fast and the screen quality is excellent. The volume doesn't get as loud as I would like but it is still really good. I also wish the cursor pad was positioned a little more to the right. I keep double-clicking when I don't want to. I can deal though. This is the best bang for your buck.

Also, there's no light to indicate if you're on uppercase letters or lowercase letters and if the number lock is on. There's a way to turn on the noise to let you if you have the Cap's lock on, which can getting a little annoying. Those are just minor adjustments to get used to but other than that, its a great product.\n",

To boot up this machine in Linux, you will need to do some painful configuration editing and there is no support for brightness control because the Linux OS will not be able to talk to the hardware on the laptop properly.

Not all of us are computer geeks and this new Windows 10 is new to some of us whom don't live on a computer and still use our brains instead of technology. Will use this for basic internet surfing, photo storage, and data files. Not into the gaming scene.

      "Basically the title says it all. There's nothing too outstanding that this laptop does to really shine above the rest but at the relatively cheap price point ($280 on Prime Day for me), it's hard to go wrong. Inside is a 120gb drive, and space to add a secondary 2.5in drive. Though it likely voided the warranty, it's very simple to do that yourself. While you have the back cover off, I'd also recommend upgrading the ram as 4gb is NOT going to cut it with Windows 10. There are two slots, I bough a second stick of ram to get it up to 12gb total (8gb + 4gb) and threw it in at the same time as the HDD. With those two upgrades done, you have a nice machine sitting in front of you, worth quite a bit more than what you'll end up paying for it. The build quality is not as good as I would hope for, but the keyboard is back-lit which I didn't expect at this price point. Overall it's a good machine with a lot of potential, just be careful carrying it around because durability is a concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "It works fine for basic tasks like internet browsing, video streaming, or schoolwork. The battery usually stays charged throughout the day, even when the power mode is set to 'best performance'. The screen is also a nice size and the picture looks good. Overall, it's a pretty decent laptop, and about the best you can get for around this price range. So far, after owning it for about month now, the only issue I've had is that it can sometimes be a bit slow connecting to the wifi on startup. Also sometimes when trying to left click using the track pad, the cursor will continuously shift slightly up and to the left, making it so I have to keep clicking on the same thing 3 or 4 times before it actually works. This issue is slightly annoying to deal with, but it doesn't happen often enough to get in the way or cause any major problems.\n",

The only reason for 4 stars is: annoying stickers on the inside, below the keyboard that leave residue behind when removed and when under heavy load, excel open, web ex going, powerpoint going, email open it can delay for a second.  For the money this thing is a good value.\n",

I also bought an extra 8GB of memory to help with the 3GB (not 4) that you actually get to use with the laptop. At the $320 that this cost before shipping, it's still an absolute steal.My only con is that the speakers are underneath the laptop. Not even at the end of the laptop, but actually underneath. This makes the sound really low any time you do not have the laptop hovering in mid air, which I would assume is 99% of the time.\n",

S mode is very hard to turn off, and believe me ,you want to turn it off.  After using MS chat support and numerous YouTube videos, I gave up and took the laptop to a \"geek\" and paid $45 to get it out of S mode because it is near impossible on this device.\n",

It does not have enough memory built into it so you will have to upgrade it which I do not know how to do. I will have to get help from someone that knows more about computers then me. I am giving it a low review because I feel like in 2020 computers should be past crashing. It should be standard that a computer has enough memory coming with it to not crash when you are using google drive, email, or youtube. Only computer I have ever owned that crashes. I guess that's what I get for buying a cheap piece of junk. I saw so many good reviews and that's why I bought this too.\n",

I won't be getting my internet connection until the end of the month so can't yet say how the streaming thing is going. I've ordered a 4 GB memory module to bring RAM up to 8 gigs and I bought a mouse as I prefer that over using the touchpad. The laptop comes with a 128 gig SSD, but with the thumb drives and microSD cards that I have, I have no shortage of storage. However I probably will consider purchasing an external one to two TB drive sometime in the future. So, all in all, I'd say that I'm pretty satisfied with this purchase.\n",

The screen is big enough to comfortably watch movies and shows, but you'll need earphones or a speaker to hear anything. One of its special features was supposedly its sound and I feel pretty let down by it. It's also really big?? I can't find a nice case for it so traveling or bringing it places is pretty inconvenient. I still use it cause I need a laptop. The price is low, but you get what you pay for. I know you can upgrade it, but meh. If you need something purely for school, this is good. If you want to do other things, maybe consider spending a little extra money for something better.\n",

      "I bought it just because I wanted something cheap that I could do a little gaming on it. But after downloading just one game it said I wasn’t able to add anymore of my expansions. (This was with nothing else downloaded onto the laptop). It just wasn’t for me. Would work better for someone in school or just needing one for casual use. I still believe it’s a good laptop for the price just not for me.\n",

      "I needed a laptop for my son's first year in college.  I waited to the last minute like I always do with things (chronic procastinator!) no literally I purchased it 2 days before he left.  I had never purchased anything with a large pricetag and/or electronics from Amazon so I was vey apprehensive.  I did a little bit of homework, read some reviews and ultimately pulled the trigger and I'm glad I did.  My son who happens to be very picky especially with electronic/technology devices and he was completely satisfied, that was good enough for me!  He says it's fast, sturdy but light, has such an amazing screen and view that he frequently uses it to watch movies or for gaming rather than his tv and it fulfills the purpose it needs to fulfill for a laptop needed for his first year in college.  Very happy mama with this purchase for my son.\n",

      "This computer is PERFECT. I ordered a 4gb stick of RAM to upgrade it and it is fast! The boot up time is instant, and playing basic games there is no lag. It is very light and I can use it in bed without it heating up quickly. I've only had HP laptops in the past and this Acer beats every one of them by far and is half the price! I'm recommending this to ALL of my friends and family.  If you are debating it, do it, you will not be disappointed!\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had it for a week and I just can't find anything to complain about. The metal lid gives it a quality feel, it boots up in 15 seconds, restarts in 10 seconds, and is faster than any previous computer I've had. I don't totally love typing on the keyboard, but I normally use an external keyboard anyway so that's not a bother. Backlit keyboard is a must have, and often doesn't come with models twice the cost.With some additional RAM, it will be close to perfect, and for the $315 I paid, I definitely got my money's worth and no regrets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The laptop has an elegant stainless exterior finish with a solid well-built feel. Was surprised how thin the laptop was at the price point. Laptop boots quick, is quiet, and performs well with Windows 10 (both \"S\" mode and regular home edition). Was initially concerned about limited disk space on the SSD but the out-of-the-box Windows 10 installation consumed a limited amount of storage. Overall, great laptop and would recommend to others.\n",

Compared to other computers I looked at in this price range, the 1080p screen, backlit keyboard, and 128gb solid state hard drive really make this a stand out. I would recommend this to almost anyone in my family except for anyone who is interested in doing any sort of gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "I completely love this laptop! I love how the keyboard lights up and how fast it is. Also that it’s very light weight for being a pretty big laptop and that the screen is wide. It’s also fast. Have no complains. I definitely recommend this for light use. I’m a college student and use this papers, I also watch videos, search things on the web. Speaker isn’t the greatest, but great laptop over all!\n",

      "I have this laptop and its great. For 300 dollars you get a thin laptop with a nice IPS 15\" screen. The performance is no slouch either, this laptop can play 4K video with no problems. It can handle many apps and tabs open with no performance slowdowns. And it has a backlit keyboard. Highly recommend this great laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speakers are on the bottom of the computer for some reason which makes them pretty quiet. It’s also a little slow, but other than that I’m pleased with my purchase. I’m a big fan of the backlit keyboard and it’s light weight. I’d recommend everyone turn the S mode off unless the laptop is being used in a high school setting (provided by the school).\n",

      "This Acer Aspire S laptop is a mixed bag, but useful and priced right for the right user.The pros are the Microsoft 10 S, the safe operating mode used in schools. It restricts your flexibility and internet use, which is a good thing for those with limited understanding of the dangers of the internet. Not having to worry as much as malware or viruses is a good thing. More on this below. The 4 GB of memory is low, but again - the price. Speaking of - the price, currently in the mid 300s, is fair for a laptop. The set-up is easy with the assistance of the onboard Cortana helper. Backlit keyboard is nice, too, although more about that, too. The sound is fair, the monitor is good, and the size, weight, and portability are solid.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the price, I think that this is a very good laptop. The only cons I've noticed are as follows:Buy the extra RAM. You see a huge difference with the extra 4GB you can add and you can get it for about $20.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worst computer ever do not buy. Hinge broke after just 4 months and Acer wont help me. Now I am charged over $60.00 restocking fee. Very disappointed in Amzon and Acer Either of you need to make this right. I will continue to review until this is resolved. Don't buy this product.\n",

And wanted to charge me 280 dollars to replace the screen of a 300 dollar laptop...not at all pleased. Amazon removed the laptop from my online purchase records so was unable to get a replacement.....not at all satisfied. A horrible shopping experience.\n",

Aesthetically this is the most beautiful laptop I've ever owned - slim, sleek and a nice metal chassis. The only drawbacks would be the 4gb of memory (which is expandable) and the fairly limited amount of storage. But for the price, this thing performs perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very nice laptop for your everyday needs. I bought it a couple of months ago. It comes equipped with pretty much everything basic. I was worried about the S Mode but it was very easy to switch off. Not a big deal. The only flaw I find with this laptop is the volume basically sucks. The speakers are underneath and even at 100% it’s still hard to hear without an external audio device. It is Bluetooth capable so that’s how I deal with that problem—with Bluetooth earbuds.\n",
      "\n",
      "I needed a laptop for school and knew that if I wanted something fast and powerful and quiet I definitely needed a gaming laptop because it wouldn’t slow down like chrome books do and I have to say by far this is one of if not THE BEST investments I’ve made for school. I love it. It’s that simple. It’s fast and quiet, and runs games from PlayStation (ps now) incredibly well and can be easily upgraded in ram size which isn’t expensive so that’s great. I don’t hear a loud annoying tap every time I hit a key and even though my personal home internet is kinda sucky this laptop works extremely well with streaming just about anything. Whether it be for school or wanting to dive into PC gaming, I’d say give this one a shot. It’s really slept on.\n",

      "\n",
      "The only draw back for this product is that the speakers are very low, possibly because they are at the bottom of  the device. For maximum listening experience u will definitely need an external speaker outlet or earpiece. It's slim, lightweight  and stylish, easy to carry around. It's not touch screen. Picture display quality is pristine. I gave it 3 stars because of the location of the  speakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am happy with this laptop I did buy the extra memory and install myself I seen how it was done on youtube. If I wasnt able to do that I would not be as happy with this item .

Try resetting to factory setup if you switched to Google chrome and you have the problem of no earphone jack discovered.\n",

I use this laptop for Respondus Lockdown test taking and it required to move out of S Mode. So far I like it fairly well..I say the price is worth it! I wish the speaker was louder and not in the back/bottom of the laptop. So it's an overall 4.5/5 from me. I chose a 5 star rating since 4 would sell this product short\n",

      "It's under $350 so I couldn't expect much and still somehow was disappointed. By the end of the 1st month it was super slow, overheating and randomly shutting down. It's clearly a bad processor. It's worse that the laptop is well sized and sturdy because that means that no money went into anything else. If they had to choose, I'd rather a crappier exterior and a laptop that won't burn my hands if I go to move it from the table. I would say if you need it for a year but this isn't likely to last me even that long.\n",

Unless you clicked on \"see more product details\" and scrolled to the bottom, where the very last thing it says is \"(system unit only)\" and you then realized that that meant no power cord and not that it didn't have any accessories; you would never even imagine that it wouldn't come with a power cord!\n",

Computer powered on and I could hear the voice prompting me to set up the computer for the first time.  I could not, however, see anything on the screen-it was completely black.  Powered off twice and turned back on...nothing.  Contacted Acer customer support, they said that it was still under warranty and I could send it in for repair.  We were not interested in repairing a brand new computer that had never been used.  Maybe we just got a lemon, I’m not sure.  Computer was returned for a refund.\n",

Am not a gamer, but should fare well on light gaming. Screen is good and run it at half brightness. 12gb of ream seems good although you can take it to 32gb but that would be overkill.

I'm happy to have bought this since it checks all those marks. It's also quite lightweight which is a plus. Basically, for reviewing powerpoints, lectures, videos, and anki decks, this is a very useful laptop and it's very competitively priced; not many other laptops in this price range offer as much.

I don't know about you but I can't be without my CPU for that long. They would not budge and told me that was their policy.  However, Amazon stepped it up with their team and fixed my issue.

It’s sturdy and has really good performance. This is perfect because either laptops are to expensive or is too cheap and not good at all. This is a decent price and has good performance. The display is awesome and it’s really clear to see. It’s powerful and portable and is great for everyday use. The backlit keyboard helps me see everything crisp and clear and have no problem struggling to type keys. The design also looks attractable and is smooth and nice.\n",

      "Do not buy unless you are willing to put in some extra money for this laptop.I have bought the vega 3 version and after I have tweaked some settings I have been able to run warframe at a constant 60 fps for most maps.I can also run war thunder from 30-60 fps on low/med settings.Most lighter games will run pretty well...in fact I was surprised with the performance.Casually this laptop is extremely good and it can watch videos in 4k without much lag if not any at all.With each model you really get what you pay for.I suggest this if you are a college student on a budget or just want to get your children or grandchildren something to use for school work and other things.\n",

In my mind I was thinking this would run slow as hell with only 4Gb. I was wrong, after removing all the unwanted software I was able to get the memory usage to around 44% when idle. I have decided to run the S mode for awhile to see how it goes. This laptop is a steal at $309 and the S mode has completely changed my mind after using it. I have another 4Gb I'm going to install and this thing will rock. Laptop runs cool as well, even when you have it sitting on your lap. I like the night mode as well, really easy on the eyes.\n",

Right out of the box it handled all of that with no issues whatsoever. It works great for work but what about for play? The screen is sharp for streaming movies and videos in 1080p! Gaming on the other hand can be a bit difficult and i thought it was due to the lack of RAM installed in this PC. I upgraded the RAM from 4GB to 20GB and the games ran much smoother and the PC runs even faster. Graphics have to be turned down some due to the lower end radeon graphics but for less the $400 this computer will do anything a normal user will throw at it.\n",

I've only had the computer for 2 months and it's already getting low on space.That being said, it has the biggest screen of any laptop I've had, it has a great number pad, and in terms of filling out documents and paperwork it works like a charm.

As for gaming, I’ve played a few strategistrategy games and the graphics and speed seem good. I can’t say whether this would be the case though if someone wanted to play Fortnight or an online game that requires mor processing speed and graphics.

I saw this computer as highly rated and under $500, I decided for a third of the cost of a MacBook I would purchase this. I am sooo glad that I did, this laptop is amazing!! Just arrived today, it’s sleek and modern looking, light weight, quality screen, and light up keyboard. Functions very well and is easy to use. I would recommend this computer to all college students, I love it!! So happy with my purchase.\n",

We've searched the internet for fixes, apparently this is a very common problem for this computer model Acer Aspire 5.  None of the fixes we tried have worked.  We have tried calling the Acer help number as listed on Amazon.  After calling twice and sitting for an hour listening to their message about how busy they are, we had to hang up.  We tried opening an issue with their help desk online, with no response.  Don't waste your money.\n",

Deducted a star for those amazing omissions. Will not work for gaming but is not sold for that purpose so no problem there but worth knowing about if you are considering this laptop.\n",

The display however, after about 6 month has a flack as if somebody has touched it with greasy finger. You can't remove it. And it's annoying. I consider returning it and test the Acer warranty, but considering I am in IReland it seems that will cost me a lot of money.\n",

      "Great laptop for the price. Surprisingly solid build quality for the price, very little flex in the screen and keyboard housing. The backlit keyboard is a nice addition and the viewing angles on the screen are great. Easily one of the best bargain laptops out there right now. Only thing I’d suggest is purchasing an extra stick of 4gb ram for $20 to significantly improve performance.\n",
      "\n",

Very frustrating and time-consuming.\n",

Very disappointed!\n",

Updated to 3 stars.\n",

Shortly after that, there was a forced Windows update, and now start from sleep times are quadrupled, all programs operate very slow now (Chrome can barely run, a click doesn't register on a fully loaded page for about 10 seconds, and this is all with the same internet speeds), typing is lagging by 2-3 seconds. I'll try to system restore it to day one and see what happens.\n",

The 4gb ram is the bare minimum, but it can be easily expanded.\n",

I messed something up trying to figure out how to download things and ended up having to factory reset the computer. IT DOES NOT COME WITH A DISC TRAY. Found that out after buying it. Had to go out and buy an external disc drive for it. Bought a computer game and It won’t download or let me play it. I’ve never had such a time with a dang computer before. Waste of my money.\n",

Good memory, great speed (less than 10 seconds to start up, so imagine) the screen is very clear. It's also one of the prettiest ones you will find if that matters to you.

The materials seem a bit cheap, not even the year and the screen opened as in the image, something that really bothered me because it has never fallen and I have cared for it as if it were my son it is truly disappointing\n",

Definitely do not use a screw driver as the chrome case can scratch.\n",

I really like that this laptop has back lit keys as often while wathcing TV I can be on the laptop and see the keys with the lights down. The keys are a little flat which can make them have a different feel when typing but I'm getting used to them. The colors are extemely vivid which is nice if watching a program on the screen.

She does not game on her pc. I always thought Acer was a great product. I have an Acer desk top with the windows 7 program and have never had any problems with it. It is over 7years old and still runs good. She was not impressed. We returned it for a refund and got it before they received their product back at Amazon. She went with an HP from a different source ( not from Amazon).\n",

For internet surfing, cloud office applications, and python programming it is perfect. Not used for gaming. No need for touchscreen. I moved out of windows 10S though due to its limitation to windows store-only apps. The cover is solid enough, not plastic like the chromebook, and after two months of use there is also minimal scratches on it. Autonomy is good too.\n",

      "I needed a new laptop that could handle really basic tasks (word processing, internet use) and this one has been great so far. I definitely took it out of Windows S mode since that was so restrictive. Screen is really crisp, battery life is good, and it's been really fast (startup, browsing, etc). I'm very pleased with my purchase so far. It's probably not ideal if you're requiring a ton of storage or graphic speed, but it's great for a basic, relatively no-frills machine.\n",

Absolute best computer I've come across for the price and durability in a very long time.\n",

He really likes the computer and is able to check email, watch YouTube and occasionally play video games mostly older titles.

All in all a very good computer for under 300 bucks!\n",

The laptop was freezing for 10-15 seconds at a time.  I know this was going to be a cheap laptop but i expected it to atleast be fast for a few months.  Either this laptop is just flat out horrendous or the QC department is non-existent.\n",

My only complaint is that the cover around the screen is wiggling. So far that’s my only problem and I’ve had it for about a month now.

      "For your high school or college bound student, this laptop is really all you need. It’s got a 15.6 inch screen (plenty of viewing area), a back lit keyboard (very handy), it’s relatively thin, and easy to store in a backpack. As far as memory goes, it’s got 4 GB of DDR4 and a 128 GB solid state drive (SSD), which is low nowadays. But since most college work is saved in the cloud, I don’t think this is all that bad. If it’s not enough for you (for instance, if you want to use this for gaming, storing videos or photos), then you will want to look into expanding this or get an external drive.Some notable features: With the IPS LCD screen, you’re going to get a better viewing angle and better color reproduction, and it’s a step up from the common TN (twisted nematic) panels. As other reviewers have said, 15.6 inches is measured diagonally. Colors are bright, crisp, and vivid, making this good for streaming videos in the dorm room. You get an AMD Ryzen™ 3 3200U Mobile Processor with Radeon™ Vega 3 Graphics. This is considered good for entry level gaming, so this is probably more than enough to get you through 4 years of college.\n",

      "This is a great laptop, with two problems. First, the hard drive is obnoxiously small. What is it with laptops still offering such paltry amounts of storage? It's absurd in 2019.Second, the backlit keyboard is great, but auto turns off after about 20 seconds and you have to hit a key to get it to light up again. That's useless. The whole point of a backlit keyboard is so you know where the keys are in the dark. I get that they want to save battery, but why isn't this a user option? I keep my laptop plugged in 90% of the time, why can't I turn the backlight on/off as I want to?\n",

I mostly use my laptop for home business (emails, word documents, etc.), general internet surfing, and some fairly light (by today's standards) gaming.

An example was a question about saving sites I visited and advertising for me.I have another laptop which is 2 years old and I have always found to be rather slow. I was comparing it to the speed of my desk top. I have found the the speed of the Acer is much greater than my other laptop.

      "I'm pleasantly surprised by this Acer Aspire. It's definitely not a lightweight machine, and from time to time I get a lag in a program opening, but for $349 (price at time of review) this is a really solid laptop. I mainly use it for work when I travel, so my reaction is based on using Word, Excel, and Chrome and not anything super graphics-heavy, but it's a solid workhorse for a really moderate price.  It does arrive in \"S Mode\" for windows, which took some googling to figure out how to disable but was ultimately easy to do. You just have to go into the windows app store and click a button to allow outside apps. Getting out of S Mode was key for me as I use Chrome (I really don't like Edge) but it was easy to disable, so not a huge deal. All in is this the best laptop out there? No, but it is a great deal for the price and works well as a secondary laptop for travel or one for teens.\n",

And I have also used the Aspire line in the past and have been pleased with the results. One thing though is that my computing needs are not very demanding or power intensive. I just mainly check my emails, browse some websites, and watch some Prime or Youtube videos. So for those activities, this Acer Aspire 5 suits my needs just fine.The laptop is easy to set up and relatively quick to boot up. I was able to get it to connect to my WiFi signal and was browsing the internet within a few minutes of getting it out of the box. The laptop looks sleek and nice. The sound is adequate. The backlit keyboard is a neat addition. Colors on the screen are crisp and clear.  And performance is good enough for my needs. One quick note though, you might want to go into the settings and change some privacy options once you have the computer up and running. Some of the default settings make me feel as if I am being spied on. Otherwise this is a pretty solid budget laptop from Acer.\n",

It literally takes longer to get this thing out of the box and powered up than it does to take it out of S mode. It takes minutes and is completely free.

First of all, the blue light filter stopped working after about eight months or so. This is crucial for me, as I deal with eye strain. I now have to wear blue light glasses when I'm using this device, and they're not super comfortable and don't work as well as the actual blue light filter did.

The backlit keys turn off if no activity on battery power, but if using AC adapter can be made to stay on all the time. 3 USB ports, one of them a faster USB 3.1 generation 1 USB port. SSD digital harddrive which is easily upgradable by DIY'ers.  You can install another SSD  or standard laptop HDD if desired.  Same with a memory upgrade. YouTube will show you how to do it yourself with just a phillips head screwdriver. Screen is a nice 15.6\" in size. The CPU and integrated Graphics perform well for a laptop in this price range. Moderate editing and creation of videos can be done too. I used MS Movie Maker without crashes.  Included is Acer's software suite of helpful utilities for making a recovery disc, etc. Wifi works well, no antenna issues.Some minor Cons to me: No memory card slot. No DVD player. Battery duration isn't as long as more costly laptops. No indicator light for Cap Lock key showing you're typing capitol letters. No indicator light using Numlock key. Speakers are reference quality only (headphones are a must). Touchpad isn't as responsive compared to more expensive laptops (I use a bluetooth laptop mouse).

      "The price may seem a little high? The SSD capacity may seem a little low? The screen size and 1080 HD are excellent! The overall performance with the SSD is very fast! In my opinion, to upgrade the 119 GB SSD you would have to do 1 of 2 things; get out of Windows ‘S’ mode and down load a data migration program as there are none available in the App store or remove the SSD (possibly voiding the warranty either way) and install it in another host and do the data/OS migration. Battery life is good for my application. A big plus is the Wi-Fi (dual band). As shipped the Windows 10 is in the “S” mode which only limits you to down loading apps from the Microsoft store. The “S” mode can be removed but you cannot go back to it. This mode is great for the young student but administrator permissions should be set by a parent to prevent leaving this mode. There are thousands of apps in the app store, some are free and others cost $$. I have been able to upgrade windows 10 to the latest Windows 10 version 1903 for x64 based systems (KB4505903) with no issues (It takes a few updates to get to this because of the version it comes with). No matter who buy’s this lap top someone will have to have some knowledge of the Windows 10 Operating System and the configuration options that are required to get the most performance for the end user.Pro’s:\n",

Solid quality case which enabled me to open several times to increase RAM.  Has functionality to perform a factory format which i have used several times.  plus it also even created a USB drive restore for this purpose.  I now hold Acer as a reliable brand to be preferred when it is time to buy a new one.  A+\n",

It automatically rebooted during my working and then showed “No bootable device”. I searched on internet and found so many people asked the same issue. I contacted the Acer support and I was told that the hard disk was damaged (I lost all files on the disk). I was told that I have to buy a new hard disk somewhere on myself. And then Acer can send me a copy of Windows 10 on flash drive to rebuild the system, but I need to pay $99.00. In this case other brand normally provide a flash drive or download link for free. So I decided to give up Acer and go to find another brand.\n",

Just remember to upgrade the ram with a minimum of 4 gig stick for running windows 10 and opt out of the S-mode for FREE . Youtube can easily show you how.

In short, though cheap, this laptop doesn't sacrifice quality for price.Next, I personally bought this laptop to be a workstation to get my school work done. But, although not a true \"gaming rig,\" this laptop will handle games as well as a $300 laptop can. In other words, although you wouldn't use this laptop for intensive gaming, you might actually get decent fps at least at low settings in even some modern games.\n",

I could repair it here at my expense or fly to the US and wait and have it repaired. That’s crazy.  It broke after two weeks. Poor customer service. Next time I buy Apple. 😡\n",

I don’t use it for music, I tried my flash player to see how it worked after reading one review saying that it sucks. Its not that great and it isn’t very loud with the volume on high.

La adquirí en rebaja por 6952 pesos mexicanos y creo ha sido una de las mejores compras que he hecho en mi vida en materia de computación. Le añadí dos memorias de 8 Gb cada una Corsair Vengeance a 2400 Mhz y literal \"vuela\" esta maquinita.

Removed the 4 GB RAM and added 2 x 8 GB, as it only supports max. 16 GB.  added a 256 GB SSD easily as it came with the bracket, screws & SATA connector.Great full HD IPS screen. Only weakness is the CPU, but adequate for general use. Quite light at 1.8kg for a 15.6\" laptop, well built, quite slim.

      "After pouring through the sea of reviews on over a dozen laptops, I finally realized I should have just stuck with the same reliable brand I used before.  I managed to get 11 years out of my Acer 7741z and figured it was about time to upgrade as my screen started to flicker and even the simplest webpages maxed out resources.  It also didn't help that I had been running Windows 7 far too long without service.I ordered my Aspire 5 on a Tuesday and received it on Thursday, despite choosing free shipping as a non Prime member.  Overall I'm pleased with it.  The Ryzen 5 is a powerhouse, yet it runs cool unless you can figure out how to get it revved up, though I'm not gamer.  It's probably more CPU than I'll ever need.  The fan occasionally comes on, and might be too loud for some, but I would say it is quiet.  Paired with the SSD, Windows 10 boots up super fast and updates take minutes compared to days.\n",

However, as soon as I started using it for a few hours to watch movies, the screen started showing artifacts and became unresponsive.

The plastic bottom pops off relatively easy (10 screws w/ suction cup) and has two RAM slots with only a single 4GB stick, I added an extra 2666MHz 8GB stick for a total of 12GB. Booted up and switched out of S mode immediately. The CPU is great for the price and the system is pretty snappy. It looks like there's room for another storage drive, but I'm not sure.Only problem so far is the US power cable. Fortunately, most Acer laptops share similar charging cables, so I'm borrowing one from an older model, but have since purchased a US to Aus converter.\n",

Usually, Windows 10 can take up more than 50 percent of the total ram and the dedicated graphic card took away 512 mb, which means you only has a little bit more than 1G of ram to use.

Conexion a cable de red de alta velocidad hasta mil megabits. Hdmi. Tres puertos usb(uno de 3.0).

So much so that I have just handed it off to my wife and bought another with a newer Ryzen chip.It boots up in a couple of seconds and other than quiet speakers it is a great machine. Cannot comment upon gaming as I don't game but for anything else I throw at it, it just works fine. It does everything WAY faster than my i5 desktop (it is getting a little long in the tooth though).

The  1920x1080 resolution is excellent, add to this a solid state drive built in and a backlit keyboard and full 15.6” display and I am a happy woman.

En cuestiones de audio tiene calidad decente, no podemos hablar de full hd pero complace con lo configurable que es.

Desde que comencé a usar la laptop procuré guardar todo en dropbox, esto, para no ocupar mucha memoria, y los unicos programas que tengo instalados son Fortnite, Google Chrome, el paquete de Office, Spotify y Whatsapp, y aún así, la memoria está llena, la verdad yo pensaba que no sería necesario agregarle otro SSD, pero a tan solo 3 semanas de haber recibido la laptop, me doy cuenta de que si será necesario...\n",

Además, el teclado retroiluminado es una función útil y muy elegante para trabajar por las noches o con poca luz. La batería dura alrededor de 5hrs. por carga. Aunque no tenga mucho espacio de almacenamiento (solo 128 GB), sirve lo suficiente para hacer trabajos escolares, navegar por Internet y ver películas y videos. La calidad de sonido es bastante buena, en espacios cerrados y en silencio suena considerablemente fuerte. En conclusión, la recomiendo ampliamente.\n",

      "Excelente equipo para todo tipo de tareas y distraerse un rato, no lo recomiendo para gamers que desean estar jugando por muchísimas horas diarias pero si para alguien que busca unas dos horas de diversión cada 2 días y tareas de Office o navegar por internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pedí este equipo el lunes 13 de enero en la noche y llego el lunes en la mañana, el paquete llego en perfectas condiciones ni un solo golpe, todo me parece excelente , corre league of legends muy bien 0 quejas, no le doy 5 Estrellas por lo siguiente:1.- cargador genérico\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything is upgradeable inside this thing.  So you get a beautiful 1080 IPS screen and for another bit upgrade the ssd and ram.  Nice and snappy to run Chrome, word etc.  Good build quality. The only flaw is it's impossible getting Linux to run stable on the ryzen processor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been using it now for a few weeks and like having a computer that fly's right along and having a lit keyboard really rocks.It's always a tossup when ya buy a out of box but this one doesn't have any signs that it was ever out of the box except maybe to look at lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Para el precio que tiene es buena computadora, en ofimática y navegación de internet va bien con los 4gb de ram que tiene. Sirve para juegos basicos como LoL. La pantalla se ven bien. Lo malo es el touchpad que no es tan bueno\n",
      "\n",
      "Super satisfait, une petite merveille.Rapide, audio superbe.\n",
      "\n",
      "La configuración del teclado viene en ingles, pero se puede configurar, el disco de estado solido más los 4gb de ram es adecuada, funciona muy bien en multitareas, para usuarios promedio es una buena opción, 4 horas de bateria con un uso continuo. muy recomendable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sin duda es una excelente compra por debajo de los 500 dolares (10,000 MXN). Tiene una adecuada combinación de hardware para las tareas básicas y las que requieren una cantidad considerable de recursos.Por obvias razones esta computadora no está destinada para el sector gamer, si quieres una laptop gamer tienes que pagar por una laptop gamer las cuales usualmente cuestan el doble del precio de esta. No significa que no puedas jugar juegos ocasionales o gráficamente no tan demandantes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compré este producto en oferta con un descuento como del 40%, ya tengo aproximadamente 6 meses de tenerlo. Por lo que pagué vale la pena definitivamente. La calidad de la pantalla es muy buena, aunque si hay mucha luz no puedes trabajar adecuadamente, es fantástico para tareas de oficina, yo le expandí la memoria RAM a 8 gb y le compre un SSD de 256 gb, me gustó que viniera fabricada pensando en la expansión. Lo único que no me gusto (pero tampoco es la gran cosa) es el sonido. No es una laptop gamer pero he probado algunos juegos y funcionan súper bien como el minecraft (la versión de windows 10 va súper bien), stellaris, banished, terraria. Estos juegos los corre bastante bien, pero claro no esta fabricada para esto.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acer been amoung some very long running companies, whit their quick adoption of the Ryzen AMD series processor and configrated graphic support on board make this bare minimum laptop amoung top of their segment. I like it so much i would recommend it and with Amazon prime priced in such a way everypne can get the benifit from that, it took only 3 days from amazon wharehouse, usa to melbourne, Australia. AMAZING, AND ASTONISHED.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gran producto, solo hay que comprarle un ssd de 480gb++ , expandir la ram y desinstalar Windows para instalar Linux y tendrás un equipo super rápido para trabajo de oficina, netflix, amazon prime video, juegos básicos y contenido multimedia, además corre league of legends muy bien a 60 fps en 1080P calidad baja-media.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked that it has a 1080  screen.......the SSD could have been larger...I added a 500 gig in the D slot so I have more space to put stuff, but would have preferred to have it the other way round. I also added more memory.all and a good machine for the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: la batería dura 4.5 horas, la pantalla se ve muy bien es fhd ips, las bocinas son decentes, no se calienta, tiene capacidad de expansión tanto de ram como de hdd, teclado iluminado, está muy muy rápida, el color plata arriba y abajo y es delgada.Contras: muy pocos puertos, no lector de tarjetas no usb c, solo un conector 3.5mm, el touchpad no es muy bueno.\n",
      "\n",
      "Para el precio iba bien pero lo que si ya no me gustó fue esta raya en la pantalla, he tenido muchas Laptop y esta es la primera a la que le sucede esta falla y a tan solo 6 meses de haberla comprado! Muy mal.\n",
      "\n",
      "La laptop es delgada y ligera, los materiales se sienten bien, solo tiene aluminio en la parte de arriba, es necesario agregar memoria RAM y mas almacenamiento, compre 4 Gb en ML de la misma marca a solo 300 pesos, y un ssd de 240Gb en 580. La computadora la compre el black friday y llegó en 6 dias. Puede con juegos no muy exigentes, jugué GTA V en 720 cerca de los 40 fps, también GTA IV. Recomendada para personas que no necesiten mucha potencia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hasta ahora todo va de maravilla, es muy ligera y delgada con buena autonomía\n",

      "Excelente computadora, tengo 6 meses usándola, le instale otra memoria ram de 4gb (quedando en 8gb) y es muy rápida, el encendido no demora más de 30 segundos lista para usar, tiene un desarrollo en gráficos bastante aceptables, sin dudarlo es la mejor opción por el precio, incluso que opciones más caras.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compre esta laptop por que me parecio que estaba bien equilibrada entre procesador, tamaño de la pantalla y ramllevo con la laptop ya 5 meses y puedo decir que me salio muy buena, muy rapida, tiene un peso adecuado,\n",
      "\n",
      "Cumple con todas las especificaciones que promete, el diseño me parece muy bueno y ligero. El procesador Ryzen 3 era mi duda al comprarla, sin embargo puedo decir que compite mejor que un i3 (o incluso i5) de octava generación. La pantalla Full-HD con IPS otro punto a favor. Windows S se puede quitar de manera sencilla, le instalé la suite de Adobe y Office, todo lo corre sin problemas.\n",
      "\n",
      "En general es un gran equipo, los 8 núcleos se notan. Pecan de un sonido precario. Aunque en general tira muy bien, personalmente preferiría que fuese de 13-14 pulgadas ya que el teclado númerico no me sirve y en general no me gustan las pantallas grandes.Le metí otra DDR4 de 8 GB, trae 8 GB ya soldados, y es muy apreciable que te incluyan en la cajael cody para un segundo SSD/HDD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really good laptop for its price and with lots of upgradable options. I added 16 GB of ram (2x8gb) and planning to upgrade the storage in the future with sssd. Only issue I got with mine is that the speakers are a bit muffled and not very good, I usually use external speakers so it's not a problem. There are tons of reviews online on this laptop. Also it comes with USA  adaptor so U might need a Australian one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Está a buen precio para los componentes que tiene. Se enciende y apaga bastante rápido. Corre los videos en 1080p de manera fluida. Algunos de los inconvenientes son que no trae la \"ñ\" (aunque se puede usar sin problemas cambiando el tipo de teclado) y la memoria ram podría ser insuficiente (yo recomendaría añadirle una de 8 gb).\n",
      "\n",
      "Enciende bastante rápido por el disco que tiene, la pantalla es muy nítida, vale mucho la pena. El único detalle que encuentro es que el cargador no parece ser el original. La caja llegó un poco golpeada pero parece no ha de afectado al equipo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excelente laptop, muy bonita y tiene muy buenos acabados en aluminio. Viene completamente nueva, solo el cargador es genérico. De ahí en fuera me ha funcionado muy bien. La batería le dura bastante. Después de encenderla a los 5 segundos ya estas en el escritorio de Windows, muy rápida.CONSEJO: Si la van a usar en Idioma Español dejen configurado el teclado en ingles para que las teclas coincidan con los caracteres que muestran.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unos de los ganchos que sujeta la ram no funciona, no se puede saber si las mayúsculas están activadas o desactivadas, para conectarle audífonos necesitas reiniciar la laptop si no no funciona....son muchos detalles que la verdad preferiría pagar mas por otra laptop....\n",

      "\n",
      "I bought the Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop (15.6\" Full HD IPS Display) for my mum who uses it to watch korean/chinese dramas. She is really happy with the video quality, and since that's all she uses it for, the laptop is performing to its purpose and I have no complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would have to be the best notebook I have owned for a long time for the price. Acer have out done them selvesJust upgrade the RAM and WOW! I have 16gb in mine but you can upgrade to 32gb? and I will be upgrading the SSD drive as only a 128gb?\n",
      "\n",
      "The ryzen 3 3200u is the best apu for this price point the 4000 ryzens are coming out but come with a hefty price the 128gb ssd does cut short though and the 4gb ram and if the ram was running at 2666mhz rather than 2400mhz it would give the cpu more potential in performance but the mini ethernet cable does help in certain situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Velocidad, capacidad, volumen, precio pff una ganga!!! No tengo ningún inconveniente con este equipo, la ram ahora me es suficiente pero es fácil cambiarla por una más grande y también puedes cambiarle el SSD si necesitas más espacio.\n",

      "Super recomendable, muy rápida, el precio es muy razonable, es teclado de inglés pero se configura, por lo demás estoy emcantado, he probado juegos básicos, en su mayoría de estrategia y muy bueno su rendimiento\n",
      "\n",
      "Lo que me encantó fue el teclado retroiluminado y la pantalla, es más de lo que esperabaEs una excelente laptop para trabajo o un estudiante y aunque con unos 4gb más de RAM se pueden jugar algunos juegos viejos no tan demandantes\n",
      "\n",
      "La compré en el Black Friday por 6,300. Aún así, me parece que está a un buen precio.Muy buena para hacer tareas y algo de Gaming, corre League of Legends en gráficos máximos a unos 50-60 FPS.\n",

      "For someone on a budget, or simply if you don’t need to play video games on your laptop, this is an incredible laptop with almost no downsides at an amazing price. If you prefer a machine that can play games as well you might not find what you’re looking for here, but anyone else will be hard-pressed to find a deal this good. Be warned however that this laptop does ship in WIndows 10 “S Mode”, a version of the OS which purposefully limits what can be installed on the computer in order to make it more streamlined. I strongly recommend your switch out of this mode immediately, which can be done very easily and in less than 5 minutes. Once you do this you cannot switch it back on, but I cannot imagine any reason you would want to limit your computer to only install Microsoft products and nothing else.---------------------\n",

      "I am not a computer techie, so this will not be a particularly technical review.First off, I LOVE how light this computer is. I have another laptop at home that is smaller than this one and it weighs so much compared to this one.  Makes it so easy to carry back and forth to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great laptop if you are looking to use it mainly for school work, watching YouTube videos, and social media. The processor is a little bit outdated, so it isn't going to run the latest games fast or well, but you will be able to take your online classes with ease.Lots of people have already talked about all the stats and ports, etc. So, I'll just say that this laptop has pretty much everything you need to charge your phone, plug in a mouse, and even plug in an external monitor if desired. It also comes with a hard drive update kit, so you can add more storage space if needed. (And the process is very, very simple.)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the perfect laptop for your every day computing needs. It is powerful enough to work on a few Office documents at once, as well as watch some YouTube or Prime Video at the cottage. I love that this laptop has a 1080p screen. The screen is crisp and bright, and for the price this was a huge surprise.While the 128GB SSD does seem a little on the small side these days, it is more than enough as long as you're not dealing with huge amounts of media. Excluding space taken up by the operating system, there is plenty of room for all of your photos and documents. I did not have any real performance slow downs with the laptop, just do not expect to do any gaming or render large projects.\n",
