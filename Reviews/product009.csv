"Works great! Picked up 28 channels. Glad I cut the cord on cable. This was easy to install and once we mount our TV, it will be totally hidden.",5,1,2019-11-3,1,2,1
I highly suggest buying this it’s a great product when I scan channels on my television with this I was receiving 33 channels and I don’t have cable so those are all free!!!,5,1,2019-10-31,1,2,0
Mounted 32” tv on patio wall.... wondering how I’m going to get any channels without paying for another overpriced Frontier box.Did the research on digital antennas and rolled the dice on this model based on ALL positive reviews and price.,5,1,2020-2-21,1,4,0
The antenna is great. I have around 60 channels now. The set up was easy and quick. I did it myself in about 10 minutes. I love it and would recommend it to everyone! FYI I live in Central Florida area.,5,1,2020-2-1,1,3,0
Just received my antenna and could not be more pleased. Within 10 minutes I had antenna hooked up and watching tv. I am getting over 30 channels and am cutting cable.I would recommend this antenna to anyone,5,1,2019-11-1,1,2,0
"It was easy to install, as soon as I plugged it in it gave me about 10 channels, then I run the channel tuning on the TV and got about 69 channels. Not bad for the price, it gets some HD locals.",5,1,2020-2-4,1,2,1
I just received my HDTV antenna today 2/4/20. It was super easy to set up and without placing it near a window I received tv channels. The quality of the images was HD quality and I couldn’t believe my eyes. I decided to place it in a spare room because that room has a window but I didn’t place it near the window and yet I was still able to get HD TV. I can’t believe I waited this long to get one of these antennas. From what I hear from friends my antenna is far better than theirs. They tell me their antenna have to be placed in a window.I’m very happy with your product because of the quality of the pictures and easy setup.,5,1,2020-2-4,1,2,0
"I bought this Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna last week. Now there are 54 clear & stable digital channels, and the favorite kid channel is back. We love it, thanks for this great product.BTW, I live near the foothill of Los Gatos, CA, the signal is not good, I have 2 other normal antennas, with them, I can only get about 10 channels and they are not stable, my kids complained a lot. but with this antenna, it amplifies the signal and we get images with very good quality.",5,1,2020-1-28,1,1,1

It works great! Looks great! We love it! We have a 4K tv!,5,1,2019-11-19,1,5,1
I previously bought a cheap Walmart version of this and it couldn’t pull my local abc channel. That took 20 minutes just to pull 26 channels Smh. I love on an second floor apartment building and my internal one sucks. This one from amazon took about 5 whole minutes to set up and pulled 43 channels. I splurged a tad more than the cheapo Walmart one but it was well worth it.,5,1,2020-1-25,1,1,0

"This is a great little purchase.  I originally purchased this antenna to pair with a new t.v. which was located in a room that has just a few viewers.  But, once I saw how clear and stable the channels were in that room, I decided to use this new antenna on the large screen t.v. in the living room, where most of my family watches t.v. The kicker is that I originally had the family room t.v. hooked up to an old, outdoor antenna (not digital), which often failed to keep a stable picture.  ( I live 40 miles away from the nearest t.v. tower.).  Once I switched to this little lightweight gem,  the local channels became clear, and stable.  There's no more of the going off and on, which I have endured for a long time.  This antenna I would recommend to anyone who's tired of settling for jumping screens .  Buy this antenna and you won't be sorry.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,3,0
"Great antenna. I actually mounted this on the glass of My patio Door wall and the reception if Great. I have had a hard time to a local station WJBK during windy weather. It was windy the other day and it never effected the reception. Make sure if You mount the antenna using the 3M mounting disks, make sure it is going to be in that place for a very long time. I was in a hurry and due to the cable connection piece, the door wouldn't' open all the way and I had to move it. the Mounted disks didn't want to come off the glass and I had to buy a couple new ones. That was My Fault and honestly no big deal. I now know the mounting disks will work for me if I ever need them again. Love, the antenna. This is My fourth one(no cable bill for me) and it works the best.",5,1,2019-12-6,1,2,0
"My 6 year old opened the package and insisted that he put it together and hook everything up. I took a step back and watched in amazement as he proceeded to plug everything in, connect all the cables and us the controller to set up the antenna on my Samsung TV. The process took less than 15 minutes so if you are someone who isn't very tech savvy please know that it's so easy to setup for even a first grader!Picture looks great and after everything is plugged in it works seamlessly! Great product for the price!",5,1,2019-12-11,1,2,0

"I live in a very rural area in the northern part of Colorado - just far enough away from many locations to do anything but have a satellite dish for TV stations.When I built the house in Colorado I made every effort to follow ""the rules"" for transferring my account from Virginia to the new place.  AT&T purchased DirecTV and just treated me like crap.  I was a 17 year subscriber of DirecTV and as I was making this move AT&T just cancelled my account without a reason why then forced me to resubscribe as a new user.",5,1,2019-11-4,1,2,0
"This is now the third flat indoor antenna I've purchased.  Each one has boasted greater miles in gain.  This one claimed 120, I thought finally one that would bring in all the OTA channels.  The furthest stations are about 60 miles from me so it should be no problem.  Nope, this antenna was about as useless as the previous others and I completely regret wasting my time and money.  It's connected properly, aimed appropriately and with no indoor interference and picks up less than a third of the stations out there.  So thoroughly disappointed.  Just out of curiosity I even ran this antenna outside and it barely gained any reception.  My suggestion to any of you who aren't very close to your broadcasting stations, stay away from products like this.  Get a real OUTDOOR antenna.",2,1,2020-1-6,1,6,0
I just plugged in my HDTV antenna and the results were immediate. It doubled my available channels and my regular channels are clearer than they’ve ever been. Easy to install and I had my channels setup in under 5 minutes. Definitely recommend for my friends and family!,5,1,2019-11-3,1,2,0
I purchased your antenna from Amazon and received it in 2 days.  Packaging in good shape no issues.  Installing the antenna was easy.  Instructions were very good and easy to understand.  Scanned for available channels and am picking up 33 in total.  Enjoying the FREE TV that we get over the air.  Thanks for saving me money on cable!!,5,1,2019-12-11,1,2,0

I bought this to replace an old Wineguard unpowered flat antenna.  Even with power this only does marginally better at receiving stations and really I think that's only because I had to move it. My experience says that all of these flat antennas are the same (power or no power). This one was relatively expensive at $27 when you can find others $10 less here on Amazon.Some things I like about this antenna.....I like being able to plug it into the USB on the TV for power (not that it helps). I also like the 4 corner holes that allow me to pin it up without tape or those sticky strips.,3,1,2019-12-16,1,4,0
"I bought the HDTV Antenna yesterday and the package arrived today.  Ultra fast delivery, really happy about that.  But the best part is how easy and how powerful this antenna really is.  Bought this for the Toshiba Fire TV we have at the office (we are in City of Industry, California).  According to RCA Antenna App, our office actually faces away from the broadcast towers, but incredibly, we were able to get clear reception on most of the main channels (except for channel 7.1) with high clarity!  Everything took about 5 minutes.  Connected the coaxial and USB cable (most TV bought in the past 10 years should have at least one USB port, so you don’t even need the included power adapter, which eliminate cable management), and used the included double sided tape to mount the antenna on to the window (about 5 feet high).Cut your cable TV and get this! We get most of the content we watch from Netflix and Hulu any ways.  Great saving.",5,1,2020-6-19,1,3,1
"Based on a lot of favorable reviews I ordered this antenna in the hopes that I would be able to use it to view the local over the air major network channels in the Austin area.  Per google maps I live 32 miles as the crow flies from the Austin over the air local stations broadcast towers.  The antenna was able to pull down quite a few channels.  However, most of them were for programming I have no interest in whatsoever.  Of the channels I was able to receive the picture quality varied depending on the channel from good to not so good.  In spite of repositioning the antenna a few times I was only able to pull down the over the air signal from only one of the local network affiliates.  I knew before I ordered the antenna that it would be a hit or miss proposition but unfortunately the antenna was a miss in my circumstance and did not work for me to be able to view all of the local network affiliate broadcast channels.",2,1,2019-12-6,1,4,0
"Probably under ideal circumstances this indoor antenna would pull in more channels.  I received 12 DTV channels - 4 with no connection, 3 in Spanish, Court TV, some channels with TV shows from the 70s, and one complete NBC station.  Except for NBC logo there was no channel designation like TNT or FX.  Picture from NBC was very sharp, colorful, and didn’t suffer lags or breakups. I live in suburban Philadelphia. We are lucky to have lots of area TV towers. I see no reason why there was only one useful channel.FYI:  I installed the antenna on a window as recommended, but when placed high on the wall above my (new) TV it actually brought in a few more channels.  My streaming TV is in a spare room.  I also have Verizon FIOs and get complete channel coverage in other rooms.  Cord cutters should be aware that the best reception might be in a room you don’t want a TV.  I found that Pluto (free) TV offers hundreds TV shows and movies for streaming if commercials don’t bother you.  In addition to transferring sports on cable to streaming, I also subscribe to Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO MAX, EPIX, and Brit Box...all commercial free. I found the price of a specific cable package is within $5 of the new $65 YouTube Live TV.  Cable instantly connects...no spinning circles.",3,1,2020-9-18,1,2,0
We recently got rid of our satellite television package. Most of what we watch we stream. We wanted an option to be able to see our local channels. We live in a very rural mountainous area so we did not have high expectations.Set up was simple and after running the scan we ended up with 13 channels. There are only 4 broadcast stations within a 60 mile radius so the range on this must be as described.,5,1,2019-11-7,1,6,0
"Admittedly,  I rarely write reviews,  but I felt as though this antenna deserved a shout out. A few years ago and after receiving mysterious bills from my cable company in the middle of billing cycles (you know who they are...rhymes with ""Con-cast""), I cut the cord and bought an antenna.  I don't remember the brand but it was okay.  I live in Chicago and even though the broadcast signals were fairly close,  I was unable to get a few major networks.  I tried moving it around and still couldn't get the same channels,  and the ones I could get would lose the signal if it was raining or too windy. I smashed it when the signal cut out during the Packers game.  I  saw this brand,  read the reviews and decided to try it.  After a channel scan. I was able to receive 17 more channels than with the other crappy antenna...and not just receive them, but at full strength with no disconnections. Even in temperamental weather,  I can see everything as it should.  Best brand on the market.",5,1,2019-11-10,1,3,0
"The few channels that it received were good. In my area I have over 10 stations available well within the advertised range of this antenna. On the first programing attempt I did not get any. I moved the antenna from the wall to a window across the room. It found four stations, only 3 of them go good quality. The stations that were programmed were within twenty miles of my house, not the advertised 120 miles.",3,1,2019-11-11,1,5,0

"I got three statiions from the anteena.  They were all PBS stations from Bloominton Indiana where IU is located.  This anteena is suppose to get stations 120 miles away.  Inidnapoils is 50 miles away which CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC is located which I can't get.  So the product is not as advertized.  I was hoping to get those stations so I could get rid of satalite.  I haven't decided to return the anteena yet.  Maybe I could get some help to get the network stations.  I've moved the anteena all around the house to no prevail.",3,1,2019-12-1,1,1,0
"It's good, but it's not magic... let me explain... I have a 2 level home, I wanted it for the ground floor, long story short... I didn't work, not even with the ""amplifier"" or moving it around like a cellphone in the 90's I could get it to get a strong signal... after that, tried it in the second level, strong signal this time, awesome picture quality.. so its good but if you have a signal weak spot or your tv is not in the best location... no different from a $6 antenna in my experience, hell I went back to the $6 one that I knew where to locate to give me the bare min...",3,1,2019-11-25,1,1,0

Sadly for me this thing doesn’t work very well at all.  I can’t figure out how this thing is directional as some state.  I get little to no channels with this mounted on the wall facing into my room.  I point it the other way towards the towers in Seattle and just as bad or worse.  The best signal I got was the thing laying on a ladder facing up?  In short there is no reasonable place to mount this thing where I get a good signal.  I even tried my FB upstairs and only got 3 channels.  How I got 17 downstairs and only 3 upstairs is apparently a mystery.,1,1,2020-1-18,1,8,0

"I figured I could get regular franchise broadcast stations. You know: ABC, CBS, NBC, and maybe a few local ones like KTLA, KCOP, etc. No. These stations were not among those found. The receiver found 1 Spanish-language station, 1 infomercial station, I English-language station playing some completely forgettable movie and 14 Asian-language stations, evenly split between Chinese-language & Vietnames with some Tagalog & Hindi thrown in for variety.So, with this device I can watch none of the stations I want to, but I can watch many I don't want to! It's like a double-bonus, or is that double-bogus.",1,1,2020-5-5,1,5,0
"I ordered the antenna for an upstairs bedroom TV we don't use very often. Instead of paying the cable company $12/month forever for yet another cable box, we decided to give this unit a try as a $28 ""experiment"". Install we easy, scanning for channels took a few minutes, but we ended with 18 ""free"" channels, enough to satisfy our need for that tv. Channels include NBC, FOX, PBS (3 channels), ION & ION Plus, several shopping channels, etc. We live in suburban Portland, OR in an area with my valleys and hills. I suspect we could pull in more channels if we live a  flatter terrain. Going to recommend this unit to my adult son (with no cable) who lives in downtown Portland.",4,1,2019-11-23,1,8,0

"Bought the antenna in an attempt to get local channels on our TV. Tried another from Walmart before I bought this one, but neither one worked. No channels on the scan. It simply doesn't pick up the channels. I dunno, maybe I'm too far from the tower or simply facing the wrong direction, but for whatever reason, this thing does not work.It also came repackaged. It's not a new antenna as someone before me had it unwrapped and parts and pieces put into the bag. The cord was wrapped haphazardly and the twist tie was undone and had obviously been redone a number of times. Frustrating.",1,1,2020-2-11,1,1,0

"Installation for me wasn't quite that easy. The font was small on the instructions and it was a pain tightening the coax cable. Wound up looking at the pictures in the instructions for help. Tried with and without amplifier; got more channels with it. My old CRT TV needed a separate coaxial cable for the converter box which was not supplied. Put the antenna, using two of the four sticky disks, on the window as high as I could, figuring I would get a massive amount of channels. Nope. Not much better than my old rabbit ears. Set TV to do a manual search and fooled around with antenna placement until  ION Network (hard to get in my area) started showing a strong signal. Plopped the antenna at that spot, which is on the wall about five feet from the original location. Rescanned. Works great, coming in with over 45 chaennels. So, do mess with that antenna until you find a good spot.",5,1,2019-12-7,1,3,0
"I purchased this HDTV antenna for our basement TV. I wasn't sure if we would get good enough reception in the basement, but I decided to take a chance based on the reviews I read of this item.

Ordered the latest 2019 Amplified HD Digital Antenna Long 120 Mile Range antenna so I receive local channels.  Installation was easy and I had it running it only a few minutes.I tried the antenna in several locations (even in the window) but settled on placing it flat on the top of our entertainment center.  Moving it around did not give me additional channels than the original 12 I got in the first location.

I couldn't be happier with this antenna. I discontinued my DirectTV service because of poor service after AT&T acquired them.

"due to the cable TV companies constant  rate increases , I had no choice but to cancel  cable Tv . Upon looking around for other options, I found your web site and decided to order the HDTV ANTENNA.

Well, I was very surprised to see how many channels I had access to, and in HIGH DEF.I was able to get channels that the cable company doesn't even offer. And to get the old reruns of the game shows from the 70' s and 80's along with the black and white sitcoms from the 70's I was impressed. I would recommend your HDTV ANTENNA to everyone who's sick of paying those outrageous cable bills. Wish I had found  this antenna sooner. The price is very reasonable.

Best of all, there was no noticeable signal drops while watching TV.

This product is absolutely amazing! As a streaming family we do not have regular cable and have not for years. But we missed our local channels. There are not very many options for getting our local channels and with the recent COVID-19 outbreak it is important to keep up-to-date with information. Local news channels are important this is an amazing product to remain a streaming family and not add any monthly payment with expensive cable service.

"The antenna was easy to install. They included Velcro squares in case you need them to mount it.  Several channels come in but NBC does not come on mine so no Thursday night football for us. There are only so many places I can try moving the antenna to; the cord is fairly long but it is not infinite. I could not really tell that the short range/long range switch actually changed anything other than the light changes colors from amber to green. Overall, it’s a one time fee to pick up several channels. Not bad investment. If only NBC would come in....",4,1,2020-9-10,1,2,1
"I already knew that we have strong signals in Tucson AZ, and line of sight to the transmission towers on a nearby mountain. It found 21 channels. The important matter for us that reception for local channels is crystal clear, as clear as cable. (A note to people hearing/seeing ads for these things: They do not replace cable with all the services and channels available from cable or satellite tv. You will get what is broadcast locally, like ABC, NBC, Fox, CBS, Univision, which will include some extra services as ""side channels"" provided by local tv, but is not going to include things like ESPN, CNN, History, premium services. You will get your local network channels plus some others like Bounce. This product shows channels in their photos which are not likely to be available as they are typically not broadcast locally, like CNN, ESPN, Nickelodeon.)",5,1,2020-6-24,1,1,0
"I have been using antennas for years now,  for about a decade after cutting the cord.  I used to only receive the basic stations that you would normally expect.  I had been using one of those old bunny ears antennas for years and didnt have any reason to update.  Well, my bunny ears stopped working and it was time for something new.  I just was not sure what to get and had to depend on reviews and ratings here.  I have to say this is 5 star quality! The second i finished installing the antenna channels immediately started coming in. I got all my basics, in crystal clear HD as well as dozens upon dozens of other stations i had never even heard of. Movies, tv shows, talk shows, news, weather- everything.  Literally dozens of free, crystal clear vivid HD channels.Get this antenna and you will will not need cable ever again.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,1,0
"The install was very easy and instructions well done.  Put the antenna in a window facing the direction of the stations I wanted to receive (antennasdirect website has a great tool for identifying stations and the direction to point the antenna).  I scanned for channels and did find several digital TV signals that it created channels for, but most were not watchable.  The picture would freeze, get pixelation, go black, or show digital artifacts on most of them.  Maybe 1 was relatively stable for watching.  My stations are 35-45 miles away and show as having weak signals in my area.  I'm in a wooded area, and it is summer as I write this, so lots of trees with leaves on them between me and the stations I was pointing at.  I thought (was hoping) an antenna rated for 200 miles might be able to pull in a weak station from 45 miles away, but that is not the case here, so looks like I'll be keeping my streaming service for local channels, or looking for a more powerful antenna, perhaps an externally mounted one.  Returned the item for a full refund so no complaint with the return policy when it proved to not work for me.",3,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0
"We kicked TV cable and our satellite dish service to the curb last year and have been streaming programs we want to watch. The thing is, we miss out on local news, live sports broadcasts, and other things. We decided to host some friends over to watch the Super Bowl LIV football game, but how to watch it? Then I remembered reading that local stations still broadcast signals and are available to watch if you have a digital antenna. SO, on 1/27/20, we ordered a GESOBYTE Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna. It arrived only four days later.I must admit I had fairly low expectations of its potential performance. We live in a small-sized city in a semi-rural area. This thin plastic sheet antenna seemed awfully small. More than that, it cost less than half of just one month fees from our old cable service. I figured we might be able to pick up maybe three or four stations still broadcasting some kind of content in our area. (I still remember the shadowy picture we picked up from the enormous roof antenna we had back when I was a kid. Even with that huge aluminum antenna high on the roof, we only got four stations.) Still, the only other option to watch the game was to go back to paying the ridiculous prices charged by the local cable company. No way was I going to do that! Whatever picture we did or didn’t pick up from this antenna would just have to be good enough.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,2,0
"Cut the cable cord Monday after prices had risen another $10 this month. My UMustHave HDTV digital antenna arrived Wednesday. It took a solid 3-4 minutes to setup including removing it from the box. Very easy. The most difficult aspect is screwing the coaxial cable to the television. We have our antenna in a nearby window and receive 45 digital channels including all of the local channels. Alas there is no ESPN; however, with the $220 monthly saved from ditching cable I could easily pick up a streaming service that carries it and still be saving a fistful of dollars. Have I mentioned the HD local channels are actually sharper than they were with cable? I already found two great channels, Decades TV and Comet TV, I love and I still haven't fully investigated every channel we receive. I can't believe how uneasy I was to free myself from the cable tyranny. Seriously. I should have done this last year and saved a couple Thousand Dollars! Oh, it's been raining nonstop all day with no loss in signal. My overpriced cable would have been dropping intermittently throughout. Unbelievable. I'm thrilled with my UMustHave antenna; I have 2 additional televisions and will be getting one for each. Thank you for delivering a quality, reasonably priced product that actually works as it should.",5,1,2020-1-27,1,1,0
"I ordered this product, because I was having trouble with cable TV, and I wanted to be able to watch the networks during the interim. I was confident that if I wasn’t satisfied, Amazon would accept the return.It was delivered yesterday, and I installed it today. I receive about 30 channels in West Palm Beach Florida, including all the major networks. I had attempted to use an indoor antenna a few years ago, and it did not work satisfactorily. This one works great, and it’s easy to use the amplifier by plugging in the USB into the port on the back of the television.",5,1,2020-6-27,1,2,0
I ordered this antenna and within one day it was at my door. I immediately installed it. I am 72 years young. The installation was very simple and straightforward. I was able to get 126 channels. I was paying a lot of money for just the local channels.  I get those and a lot more now. The picture and the sound is perfect. Can’t tell the difference between this and my cable service. I Will not be missing my expensive cable bill at all. I highly recommend this antenna.,5,1,2020-2-22,1,4,0
"I'm not great with tech stuff, but this item was user-friendly and easy to set up. I was able to save money by getting rid of cable, and getting the basic channels with this antenna. If you use the government dtv maps website, you can put in your zip code, and they will tell you how likely you are to get certain local channels, and what direction they are from you, so you can try to face the antenna in that direction. I did not need the amplifier they sent,  since I am not too far from the tv station satellites. Once in a while the TV reception gets a little choppy, but it also did that when I had cable, so I am not complaining! Love this item!",5,1,2020-3-19,1,3,0
"To be clear, this is replacing a unit I already have; I'm comparing this product to my current antenna.  The good: it's easy to set up and picks up 28 channels.  The only picture and sound that is watchable are Fox and two Spanish channels.  The other 25 channels are barely watchable.  My current (non-powered antenna) I get the same watchable result and 11 channels overall.  The bad: When I turn on the TV, the unit isn't working, and I have NO channels.  I have to go through the tuning process every time.  I don't have this issue with my passive antenna, so I know this is an attribute to this product and will return to Amazon.",2,1,2020-2-6,1,3,0
This is an updated after a couple of weeks of purchased it.The quality is still Good in some channels but we have lost many of the channels that we got when we first set it up.,3,1,2020-4-20,1,2,1
"Very easy setup, straight forward and direct. Hung it on my lamp, un-coiled the coax cable, screwed it to the signal booster, plugged the  USB adapter in to an outlet, plugged the USB from booster to adapter and connected the coax from booster to TV...done. Turned the TV on went to antennae settings and scanned for channels. After a few minutes I am up and running. On average my channels are getting 4-5/5 signal strength.I live 31 miles east of Mount Wilson Observatory in San Bernardino County where the broadcasting antennae’s are at.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,2,0
"When I first picked up the Amazon box I was a little confused.  I knew what was inside but it was so light I thought it was just an empty box.  Well the GESOBYTE Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna is rather flimsy, being just a piece of plastic about twice as large as a typical mouse pad & only half as thick but it works.  I use Plex & two HDHomerun HDTV tuners for my over-the-air reception.  A few months ago, here in Tampa, the local NBC station ""reconfigured"" their antenna to, as they said, provide better coverage.  I don't know what they did, but the local Tampa AVS Forum began to fill up with nothing but complaints.  At first I lost all reception, but about 3 month later I could get a signal but it was unwatchable as it was constantly breaking up.  Enter this device.  The actual install took about 30 minutes.  Just off my kitchen is a linen closet that my wife let me take over as my ""server"" closet.  Among other things installed there is the aforementioned Plex server, the digital tuners, & my 25 Terabyte storage server.  Also, this is where I had installed an 8-dollar pair of rabbit ears & coax splitter.  I swapped out the rabbit ears for the GESOBYTE & my NBC reception problems disappeared.  Again, the product feels super flimsy & frankly I attribute its success to the built in amplifier as the antenna can scarcely be more than a piece of wire but is well worth the price.  Hat tip - make sure to turn the ON/OFF switch to ON (green light) before use!  LOL",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,1
"This one was just like all the other Flat antennas you see all over and on TV. Supposedly has a plug in Booster that you plug in your wall outlet, no change in reception plugged in or not! Also, mounted it to the window for the best reception right? Well try to remove it from the window to relocate it to another flat surface or another window, the whole Sticky part of it Ripped from the unit itself when I tried to remove it from the window, exposing the little wires that connect to the flat part!! What garbage and wasted of money!!! Scanned the TV for channels, got less than 30 free channels! Ended up buying a 2 foot bar type antenna, with a heavy base that sits on the window sill, and a extra coaxial cable to hook up to 2 TV's, got over 60 channels! Different brand of coarse from a local department store. DON'T BUY...you will be sorry!",1,1,2020-3-28,1,2,0
"My wife and I decided that since we were the only ones using cable in the home, it was an absurd expense.  Snip-snap! And the cable was gone.  After reviewing the various antenna choices on Amazon, this was the obvious choice for an indoor antenna solution.Now we have our local channels and the kids have their streaming via the internet.  Everyone is happy and the monthly budget is saving over $200/month.  Found money, found easy!",5,1,2020-1-21,1,2,0
"I have a 65"" LG mounted to a wall. I initially put the antenna on the back of the TV and ran a channel search. I was disappointed when my TV said it only found 18 channels and FOX wasn't one of them. I then moved the Antenna to sit on the mount that touches the wall about 6 inches away from the TV and I was happy that after running the Channel scan, it found 48 channels. I didn't put it close to a window or anything and it sits behind the TV hidden from view. Love how small it is and that you'd never know it was there if you didn't look behind the TV. Came with everything I needed to mount it but Its so thin I just slipped it between the mount and the wall. I've had other 100+ roof mount antenna's that didn't get the same result as this. Very happy.",5,1,2020-9-22,1,1,1
"Needed an antenna for a patio TV.  The antenna was easy to install on a new Hisense 32 inch smart TV.  I placed the antenna high on the wall.  Our patio is enclosed, so there is no exposure to weather.  I was able to bring in 33 channels, with a net number of 25, subtracting duplicate programs onnnother channels.  The same number of channels was received in both amplified and non amplified modes.  The length of cable is a perfect to position the antenna.  There is sticky pads included to secure antenna to a good surface.  Since we live in a valley and the TV stations are about 50 miles away, the picture quality and number of channels is excellent.  I did run a check on the number of stations possible in our area and the antenna receives all of them plus.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,1,0
I live in a first floor condo - so my only option besides Comcast cable to get local stations would be an indoor antenna. I tried this out on my neighbor's small TV with rabbit ears. Rabbit ears only got 2 channels and poor picture. With this antenna placed in a window facing south he could pick up 9 channels with good picture. Decided to buy a small TV to set up in my bedroom - windows face SW. I was able to pick up 21 channels! The amplifier on this antenna makes a huge difference as I am over 60 miles to the nearest station. As long as you have no obstructions ( like a building or mountain blocking your signal) and you have a window facing the correct direction this indoor antenna should work for you.,5,1,2020-2-23,1,2,0
"I purchased this indoor antenna for use with a 2013 model Vizio television in Chandler, AZ.  The broadcast range for us was not the 150 mile possibility as advertised in the description, but much closer for our television.  The antenna arrived promptly with Prime.  My husband took it out of the box and had it installed, including scanning for channels, in about ten minutes. After using it for several days we checked online the availability of the channels in our area. There were several channels that weren't even showing up, so my husband repositioned the antenna, placing it directly on the window with the included stickers. He scanned again.  Bingo!--more of the channels that we were missing.  It is wise to check several different locations for mounting the antenna for optimum viewing.  After leaving a review on Amazon the seller sent us a second antenna completely free with free shipping.  If you're tired of being gouged by the cable and satellite companies for what is free with the assistance of an antenna, give this a try!",4,1,2020-1-24,1,2,0
"Hi, we purchased two amplified digital indoor HDTV antennas from “u must have”. We live in Sun City Arizona, and the broadcast signal towers are about 30 miles away on top of South Mountain. We have been using more expensive TERK antennas, and have not been happy with them. For one thing the TERK antennas do not bring in the five PBS broadcast stations, which we miss dearly.  I began searching for a better antenna and found the “u must have it” antennas on Amazon. After reading all the recent reviews I ordered two Antennas. They shipped quickly. We do not have extra outlets to plug in the amplified accessory, so we just hooked up the antennas to the tv, and used double-back tape (included) to mount the antenna on the wall. I admit I had my doubts about the antenna, because it is so lightweight and slightly floppy (not rigid at all). But when I ran a channel scan this floppy little antenna brought on 73 channels, including all 5 PBS channels. The antenna is hung on the wall above the tv, not in a window, but across the room from a window. The second antenna is in a bedroom, and we just slid the antenna into the top of a bookcase rather than attach it to the wall. The bookcase is on the opposite wall of the window. The tv is on the bookcase as well, and again we did not hook up the amplifier. The channel scan brought in 62 channels, including all 5 PBS stations. We are extremely happy with the “u must have” antennas! The price is wonderful too. Thank you!",5,1,2019-11-10,1,2,0
"Hello,I wanted to share my experience with you business after purchasing one of your HDTV Antenna's. First, I would like to say that the product is very lightweight and easy to install in any place needed to get a better signal. I unboxed the product and installed it in my fifth wheel camper for our family camping trips. It was very easy to assemble and install to our living room TV. After connecting to the TV and placing the thin antenna near our camper window, I ran a channel search on our TV. This antenna located enough channels to keep the family entertained during our relaxing nights in the camper. The HD channel quality was second to none and worth buying. I would highly recommend this HDTV antenna to anyone looking to get HD quality channels wherever they go.",5,1,2020-9-1,1,1,0
"I recently purchased the GESOBYTE Amplified HD digital TV antenna, and I’m super happy with the full lineup of channels that I am receiving in the Chicagoland area; local news, sports, and lots of sitcom’s, I was surprised to see the wide array of channels that I could get with just a digital antenna and not having cable TV, and although it was advertised to support 4K/1080 P picture quality, it was truly incredible to see… The picture quality is better than cable TV.All in all this product is a great value for the money, and I highly recommend everyone gives it a try before spending on cable TV subscription fees.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
"When considering there are dozens of Television Indoor Antennae manufacturers and models, I decided to research the best selling indoor antenna, along with reviewing Amazon customer reviews before selecting the Gesobyte. I'm pleased that I selected Gesobyte.  It works, and it works well.  I quickly installed the Gesobyte, and that process probably takes 5 minutes, or even less.  The Gesobyte comes with a long cable, (black in color), and an attached antennae amplifier device that has a short and long-range switch.  The amplifier is designed to either plug into your USB port on the back of the television, or the amplifier  plugs into a regular wall outlet if your TV has no USB port.  Quick, simple and no need for most to even read the supplied instructions.  The antennae itself, which is a flat mat that seems to be about 8"" x 8"" in size, easily mounts to a window or wall location that you choose, and has three (supplied) 3M sticking pads.  The Gesobyte instructions DO make it clear that you MUST be aware of the location and direction of your television broadcasting station(s) for the best signal reception.  Thankfully, the Gesobyte provides info about an internet link that you can first access to determine (through your zip code) where the broadcasting channels are located in proximity to your residence.  It's quick, and simple, and even the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has a similar website that provides the same info.  When using my old indoor antennae, I received eight or nine channels but after installing the Gesobyte I then received 24 channels.  Yes, really.  However, I did find it necessary to locate the BEST location to place the antennae, as recommended by Gesobyte, and that process may require the purchaser to have a few trial and error attempts.  As a general rule, you simply place the Gesobyte where it faces the broadcasting stations and that location could be a window, an adjacent area near a window, a table, wall, or any area that (ideally) has the correct location toward broadcasting without obstructions.  I mention all of this because I've also seen negative reviews of the Gesobyte.  It is likely some who own the Gesobyte didn't take the time to just make a few attempts to arrive at the best place to install it.  Anyway, the Gesobyte works well with my old model-year 2008 Sony TV, and the picture on each channel is incredibly clear without fading at all.  It's great to NOT be a subscriber of Cable, and to see  such an improvement over my old indoor antennae.  This Gesobyte is affordable, and I highly recommend it, too !",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"Ok, I did say a prayer before installation! Hey, I am a nurse so electronics are not my forte. Of course I disconnected TV first then followed easy written instructions and it was quick and easy. I was amazed with the clarity and sharpness of the picture. The view is as clear and as good as having cable, I kid you not! Initially, I placed the antenna in my window but noticed that when it was raining or windy, the picture had lots of gaps. Consequently, I moved it off the window but near it and it solved the problem. I get all the channels it’s box mentioned and more. In total, I am getting 35 channels, not counting the several Chinese speaking channels. You may be asking “why did you resort to getting an antenna?” My answer is that I got fed up with greed in part of cable companies. I was paying $160.00 for cable and a land line I never used. Now I have all the channels I want and need and get to keep my money to do other things. Greed is going to put the cable and the digital companies out of business and luckily for us, the consumers, the new law is for all networks to allow all satellites signals to be picked up by antennas. Es la ley and I am loving it! The best part about this particular antenna is that it comes with its own amplifier and everything you need. Enjoy the view. This seller was a great and fast speedy Gonzalez!",5,1,2019-12-3,1,1,0
"We're in the process of cutting the cord and we decided to try this antenna, purchased through Amazon. The positive reviews led us to try it. It was our first antenna purchase ever. We ordered the antenna for the bedroom so we could get local channels.We are very impressed with this antenna. We were not expecting it to produce positive results, but boy we were pleasantly surprised! The antenna itself is very thin and light - not bulky or heavy at all.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,1,0
"I already had a Mohu Leaf 50 positioned high up in a window, in one location serving a sat receiver that had died, where I needed a quick solution.  That had worked out reasonably well, which was my first evidence that these flat panel type antennas could work.  (I'm well aware of the tv broadcast tower line-of-sight factor, sites like TVFool.com, and that any of these antenna solutions tend to be a YMMV thing, depending on your location and where you can place the antenna.)  Skip ahead a couple years, and Spectrum TV just effectively doubled their bill, when it only served one room in my house, and was seldom used at all.  To the tune of $1,200. / year ?!  I don't think so !  The verdict: BYE BYE SPECTRUM !  Luckily this alternative worked.  It gets the three major local channels I cared about most, with pretty good results.  I also bought a Winegard flat panel antenna -- just in case, and seeing as the total expenditure for both was around 50 bucks -- but have not tried that one out yet.Some more details: without the amplifier piece, this one claimed to bring in about 14 channels, but only around 9 actually showed up.  They were all viewable or better.  Due to a not so great design placement for the coax connector on that small tv, attaching the antenna cable was difficult (very tight spacing, to the point that the smallest needle-nose pliers I could find could barely fit in for tightening the ring), but I was able to work around that with an adapter from the hardware store.  Using the small amplifier piece from this kit, the antenna claimed to find 65 stations, but could only display 11 of them in the tv tuner's channel list.  Mostly the same channels that showed up before, without the amplifier, but the signal was improved for some of them.  Overall and so far, I'd rate this purchase a success.",4,1,2020-5-1,1,1,0
"The Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna Long 120 Miles Range is the best purchase I made this year - and it cost me just under $30!! I mounted the antenna high on the wall and scanned for channels. To my surprise, it had pulled in thirty channels. For three days, I've tuned to most of them and each channel did not flicker or drop out. As of writing, I've used the antenna for four days - the channels received were phenomenally clear and pristine. My wife stated that she had forgotten that we watching ""over-the-air"" television, and she was right!I highly recommend this product, even if you live 25 miles from a TV broadcast tower. I'll bet you'll find that may have more ""over-the-air"" stations that you expected.",5,1,2020-4-14,1,1,0
"I wanted to be able to get basic channels on a television in our house that is not used much. I did not want to put it on our subscription plan and I did not want it to require wi-fi so I searched for HDTV antennas on Amazon.com. After studying five different models/brands, I decided  to purchase your HDTV antenna.I love this antenna for several reasons, including the reasons I stated above. It literally did take me five minutes to install this on my tv.  My tv is hd, but it is about eight years old so I was unsure I would get good results.  I did....I get a good clear picture. Using the stickers provided, I stuck the antenna on the wall near my set and scanned, getting 85 digital channels.

"The unpacking and instructions for how to connect to the TV are very easy.  No matter where I placed the antenna (high, low, near a window, etc) or in what direction, only one more channel was added to the two that my TV picks up with no antenna.

"My wife and I are considering cutting the cord and moving away from cable, but it's a tough decision. Part of it was going to be what kind of TV we could get OTA--it seems stupid to dump a $70 cable package with 1,000 channels and a DVR for YouTube or Hulu charging $55-$65 for like 100 channels (0r less) and no DVR. My TV has a digital tuner built in so I did the whole ""scan for channels"" thing to see what would happen. I got 16 channels, all the big local networks and some of which didn't come in very well. Not enough to cut the cord, but a start.So I started looking into digital antennae and based on the over 8,500 positive reviews, I decided to give this one a try. I was a bit skeptical due to the (falsely) advertised 200-mile range, since there's no such thing as a 200-mile range digital antenna (the curvature of the Earth limits any antenna to 80 miles maximum--it's an issue of physics), but I figured I'd give it a go.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,0,0
"We gave up cable many years ago and have been using old-time rabbit ears and old technology digital antennas. We finally got fed up with not receiving two of our favorite local channels on a consistent basis. We had to search for them almost every day and move the antenna all over the room to get reception.We searched for a new antenna on Amazon and came across the GB amplified HD digital TV antenna. It has great reviews, so we chose to purchase it.  We received it last week and we LOVE it!  It was easy to install and we immediately got the two local channels we wanted, plus others we never knew we could have. This product is awesome for people like us who find it ridiculous to pay for cable in the streaming age of television.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,1,0
"I bought this to watch some shows on the major networks, which were not provided by my internet TV service.I had an old-style tabletop antenna, which I plugged in, and it does okay, giving us some 10-15 channels in the metro Atlanta area.

"The “rabbit ears” antenna we had wasn’t giving the local channels we wanted on a TV in a room that’s half in-ground with no windows nearby. I saw that this antenna has an extra long cable and can receive signals from all directions, and I decided to give it a try.It’s very easy to install. We used little 3M hooks to keep the cable flush against the wall as it stretched from the TV to a window in another room. I played around a bit with the position of the antenna and we finally got the channels we wanted.",5,1,2020-9-23,1,1,0
"Our satellite service discontinued FOX.  I'm so sick of this behavior.  So, we bought this antenna.  I wasn't expecting much as we live 40 miles from the nearest city.  But we have 21 stations!  FREE!  We were even able to watch them in a storm!  Take that satellite service!But seriously... we have an unusual house with few options for antenna placement.  I opted to try it on the most unlikely location, an interior wall facing west (the city of east).  We have 21 local/network channels and only two of them don't get the best signal.  All of the major network stations are perfect.  This is just on the first try!  I'll move the antenna to new locations this weekend to see if we can get a better signal.  But I'm truly impressed so far.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,1,0
"Just installed the antenna at my mom's room in her assisted living facility.  We were very pleased at the ease of the install as well as the number of channels we were able to get.  We mounted the antenna close to the ceiling and right above a window in the bedroom on a exterior wall. The house has some sort of radiant foil underlay to help maintain the temperature of the house installed under the roof and we were concerned about how well this would work since it tends to interfere with with tower signals,  it actually works great and are very happy the results.  We purchased the antenna on amazon and received it the next day.  Will be getting more of these to so we can eliminate our costly cable. My husband is a hard sell but even he  was impressed with ease of install and channels we are able to receive.",5,1,2020-2-17,1,1,0
We are delighted with this HD Digital Antenna.  It is so thin and lightweight - easy to work with!It installed and had scanned for our local channels in less than 15 minutes. Finding an indoor location proved to be easy so we have not had to experiment with placing it outside.  We installed it on a very cloudy day but were able to get over 35 local channels. We got the ones we specifically wanted.,5,1,2020-4-28,1,1,0
I bought and installed this HDTV Antenna rated for 100 miles. I had a similar one installed and have used it for several years. It supposedly was to pull in the stations within 35 miles. It did an okay job but did not get one of the main channels here in our city and that station 10 miles away. I installed your antenna and it brings everything I had before clearer than ever plus it gets the missing channels. It was an easy install (especially since I could disconnect and see exactly where to reconnect) which took about 10 minutes total time. And that includes cleaning all the dust from behind the TV. LOL. It is not perfect but it is fantastic for the price. I love cable cutting!,5,1,2020-5-1,1,1,0
"I mounted this up near a gable vent near the peak of the roof in my attic which feeds a 4-way splitter that goes to the other TVs in my house. Since I didn't have an electrical outlet in the attic to power this antenna, I bought a light socket that has 2 outlets (readily available at any store or online) and ran a short extension cord to the antenna and I'm getting nearly 40 channels, many which are coming from out of state! I was hoping just to catch the local broadcasters and ended picking up distant ones too. We'll see how long this holds up in my attic, but if it makes it over a year in those conditions I will be thoroughly impressed!",5,1,2020-9-26,1,1,0
"I am thrilled with your product!  I installed my new antenna last night and was thrilled to see SO many channels identified while my auto channel process was in play. ABC, CBS, NBC all coming in clearly! My local PBS station, and several of my local stations in NH.  Had been using an older wall-mounted antenna that provided just 5 channels since I dropped all cable tv service 3 months ago (another great decision).",5,1,2019-11-3,1,5,0
"My experience:First of all, I was extremely skeptical that this square piece of plastic would be any better than other so-called ""powerful"" digital antennas I'd already tried in the past. In all fairness to those other antennas, and for the sake of full transparency in offering my opinion of your antenna vs. those ""other"" antennas I've tried before, I must say, I live in an urban area where the homes are very crammed together, which tends to cause much interference when trying to get ANY signals at all, even those local channels which are broadcast only 5-10 miles from my home. With my previous antennas, I was lucky (on a clear day with fair weather) to pick up even 4 or 5 solid channels that wouldn't lose signal strength (or fail to come in at all), with the slightest change in wind or weather conditions. Again, in remaining transparent in this review, I've only been using your antenna for a couple weeks, and we haven't had any adverse weather lately, other than some strong winds, but so far I'm pulling in way more channels that ever before and I just have the antenna leaned up over my fireplace. I'm confident I'll pull in several more channels once I get the antenna positioned on a window. Which leads me to the conclusion of my review. Overall, I am very, very pleased with your product. I would only offer one suggestion which I feel would make your product even more user-friendly. I feel you should offer a total of three different options regarding coax cable length. Why not offer a short option, a long option and a longest option. The reason I say this is that, I'm not going to be able to reach my window with the supplied coax cable provided, as I'm about 5 ft short and now I'll need to look into shopping on Amazon for some type of an extender. Otherwise, I'm still quite satisfied with your product and it was money well-spent, indeed!",5,1,2020-5-9,1,1,0
I just got my HDTV antenna today.  Setup was painless and very simple. Just screwed the one connector into the coax connection and plugged the usb connector into my Roku tv. Simple.  Attached the adhesive to the back of my antenna and then stuck it up high up onto the wall about 10-15 ft from my window.  And then scanned the local channels. I am in the Detroit area. That's it! I got maybe 30+ channels ... Digital picture was either equal to cable & Netflix or better.  Now I realize the local cable provider was ripping me off.  You can't go wrong with this digital antenna.  Best money I ever spent for digital reception.  Highly recommend this product.,5,1,2020-9-2,1,1,0
"Taking the antenna out of the box, I noticed I was missing the ‘magic stickers’ that it said should be included to help hold it on the wall.  But, I had some painters tape, so I used it to secure the antenna to the side of my armoire that houses my television.  I was originally planning to use the provided USB adapter to plug the amplifier directly into my surge protector strip, but my TV was too far away from the surge protector for the amount of cord provided.  Thankfully, my TV had an open USB port, so I plugged the amplifier USB directly into my TV.  Setup was easy, scanned for available ‘air’ channels and the antenna immediately pulled in several digital channels crystal clear.  I’m happy with my purchase.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0
"Easy to install and it just works! I tried a couple cheaper models and was only able to get about half of our available channels. We are close to our towers, but there are many obstacles in the way. This antenna picked up everything with 50-90% signal strength. The black was obtrusive so I painted it and it almost disappears on the wall above our 82"" screen. For reference, the picture was taken from about 15ft away.",5,1,2020-9-12,1,2,1
"I just received this antenna. It was so easy to install that I have it up and running already. My cable bill took an unexpected large jump and I decided enough was enough. I found the perfect spot for this antenna in my window and am very happy with my purchase. I love that it came with an extra long cord so I could move the antenna around better (my tv sits in a corner, but the window is several feet away). In the area I am living in, having the antenna in the window gives the best reception. This was not possible with antennas I tried in the past, given their short cords. Also, it arrived much quicker than expected, which is great since I am ""cutting the cord"" so to speak, with cable television.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,1,0
"I purchased an HDTV antenna through Amazon for my new television. I wanted to explore how it would work and stack up with cable – which I rarely use – for giving me the local television I need.I live in the sticks and for a long time, without cable, we were unable to get any channels, even local news. Now with the HDTV antenna, I have three channels connected to popular networks and give local and national news, two public television channels, and several channels showing a variety of programming from DIY shows to legacy TV shows to movies. The picture is clear and the antenna is placed unobtrusively.",5,1,2020-4-24,1,1,0
"I bought this antenna after the $70 one I bought at another store failed to receive stations where I live. I didn't have high expectations when I ordered this one but since it was so inexpensive, I had nothing to lose! I was so pleasantly surprised when I scanned for channels and it said 29 were found! My antenna that cost three times as much only received 12! I have to be honest, when I received it, I thought it looked like a piece of plastic!  I couldn't imagine that it would actually work!  I'll never make fun of it again. Higher price definitely doesn't mean higher quality ! This antenna is wonderful and I would certainly recommend it to anyone.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0
I purchased this antenna for my elderly mother. She lives approximately sixty miles from the nearest commercial TV station and approximately eighty miles from the next closest one. This antenna receives her two closest commercial TV stations crystal clear with the antenna simply mounted on the wall behind her television inside the home. We are very pleased with the antenna and we consider it well worth the price paid. Thank you.,5,1,2019-11-7,1,3,0
"I live approx 38 mikes outside of Chicago line of sight, Tried to use this antenna in an upstairs bedroom. Well after re scanning the channels several times. Tried moving it all over the room.  I was able to scan a total of 36 channels. No difference in using the supplied amplifier, Of these only 2 are major network channels. The rest are either up to 5 digital channels of the same channel, non English speaking and or shopping channels. It does work however, it just didn't pick up the network channels I was looking to receive. The coax cable is not what I would consider sufficient to get a strong signal it's much too thin more like a charging cable for a phone.",2,1,2020-5-30,1,1,0
"I live in a rural area 45 miles west of St Louis, MO.  We discontinued cable due to outrages increasing cost.  Based on good reviews on Amazon we purchased your antenna.  At first I had the antenna located on an interior wall on the second story.  While I was able to get 27 channels, including CBS, ABC, and FOX, the signal would vary depending on the time of day.  I decided to try relocating the antenna in the attic.  What a difference!  I still get about 27 channels, but the signal and clarity are sharper and constant.  It now alleviates constant re-scanning.  Also your amplifier definitely is an asset.  Without amplification, I could only get-a weak signal for 6 channels.  I am totally satisfied with the antenna, and its simple installation.  The biggest benefit:  watching total free tv and saving  $960 a year on cable. I would like to have another antenna.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,1,0
"The wire  on my older but similar, yet UN-powered, antenna was severed, so I replaced it with this. Despite so-called amplification, my reception is significantly worse, in an otherwise identical setup.  This is the case both with my TV's built-in tuner, as well as that of an external tuner/dvr device. Yes, I've plugged it into the USB port on my TV for power, etc. but no help. Can't properly pick up a station with a transmitter just 10 miles away (no problem for my old antenna).I've patched up the wire to my old unit, and it performed better already just lying on the bed, prior to installation in  place.",2,1,2020-7-28,1,1,0
"I live in a 290+ unit condo community in a heavily populated area of southwest Houston, Texas.  I imagine with some much ""stuff in the air"" it is a reason why I have had poor reception here.  Having 'cut the cord' years ago, I have tried a number of HD antennas of various price rages.  This is the first one that, so far, has not yielded anything but pristine reception with NO pixelated images.My first review, which was negative, is unsupported, and when I find it I will delete it.  The negative review was based on my inability to attached the coaxial cable, so I really had not given the device a fair chance.  I have no idea why I had difficulty the first time, but when I decided to revisit the issue, I easily connected the device.  With a thousand apologies to the seller and the maker of this device, I offer this 5-star review for price and performance outcomes.  This is also a lesson to me (and others, perhaps), to reign in knee-jerk reactions and take a deep breath before shouting THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE!",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"I  purchased the HDTV antenna to replace the outrageous cable bill I was receiving every month and I couldn't be happier!  For no cost to me, I am able to watch the morning news and other local programs.  The instructions say to hang the antenna as high as possible and I did not do that--I have it resting just above my tv on the wall (that's where I can reach without a ladder) and after the initial channel search, I have 220+ channels.The antenna is super lightweight and easy to move around to find just the right location to receive input.",5,1,2020-1-30,1,1,0

"I purchased an amplified antenna at Walmart for about $30, took it home and set it up.  I played with it trying at least 10 locations/heights/directions, rescanning each time.  It wasn't bad, I got 28 channels, most of them had 3 or 4 bars out of 5.  One thing that bothered me was the coax cable was too short, it limited where I could put the antenna and the antenna itself was boxy and thick.On a whim I decided to try this one and I'm glad I did.  Because this antenna is so much lighter, I was able to use painters tape to temporarily attach it to the wall.  The coax is much longer, which gave me more options for where it can go.  Right away I got 40 channels, and all of those previous 28 channels were 4 or 5 bars.  Best of all, it was less money for a better antenna.  I'm so very pleased.",5,1,2020-1-9,1,1,0
"I have had this antenna since January 2020. It's now July 2020 and no matter how many times I scan and rescan, this won't provide more than 2 or 4 channels. I don't really understand based on research all these stations are under 20 miles away and pretty much the same with a true heading of 88.71 to 88.93 degrees. Yet it receives some UHF channels and not other VHF channels like ABC, CBS. It occasionally surprises me and picks up NBC which is VHF.  Even with PBS new frequency spectrum for Philadelphia, it won't pick up that station. Stay away from this product. It is NOT consistent or dependable. A waste of money.",1,1,2020-7-12,1,1,0

"I ditched my local cable company nearly 6-months ago because the price kept going up and up.  I purchased an Amazon product to help with TV shows but gave up my local TV stations and news.  Finally, I decided to buy this antenna and see what I could pickup.  I'm just north of a major city in the southeast and about 90 miles from another.  I was able to get 29 channels, including ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX and a few others that I am not too familiar with.  For the cost of less than $30, this is great!  For a one-time cost, this is a great solution and easy to install, set-up the channels on your TV, etc.  Loving it now for about 4-weeks!Ok, yes!  I gave up the other 100+ channels, but let's be real!  How many different channels do we watch at one time?  I propagate about <10 channels and watch one at a time.

"I've had my new antenna for almost a month now as I waited a bit before submitting my review. I've had no issues with the antenna at all. I got a very good signal from the start. I didn't need the amplifier as I did mount it on the bedroom window where my TV is located. Haven't experienced any channel signal issues since. The instructions are included and easy to follow and include a website where you can go and punch in your zip code to confirm what channels and signal strengths you can expect to receive as well as see the mileage distances to the towers closest to you.  I found the website for channels expected and map locations to nearest towers helpful. Although the site listed is no longer showing information, there is a link on that page that will redirect you to the new page location. So that was easy and found that I should get excellent signal. Packaging was good as well, instructions easy to follow. My only wish is that the provided adhesives were stronger, and or a few extras included. Some of them fell off the next day and I didn't have enough to remount the antenna securely. So I used clear packing tape instead. Make sure the surface is clean first to get the best out of the adhesives which is what I did not do first. It’s not a deal breaker and the lack of extra adhesives doesn’t affect my rating one bit. I’m very happy with my purchase and love watching tv without paying for cable.Setup was quick and easy. I got all the expected channels and a strong signal on my first try. You just plug in the End of the antenna cable to the back of your tv, mount the antenna in your window or as high up closest to the ceiling as possible, scan for channels from your tv settings and you’re done! If your location is further away from the broadcasting towers there is an amplifier included. But I didn’t need it. You’ll know if you need it if your picture isn’t strong, they are choppy and or you are missing channels.",5,1,2020-2-28,1,1,0
"My Gesobyte Antenna arrived today. I bought it because my roof mounted antenna does not have an outlet in my office and I wanted to connect my Smart TV to the OTA HDTV channels.I followed the set up instructions which was easy to do. I did not have a window facing the TV transmitter, so I installed the antenna on an interior wall in my office that does face the transmitter. There is an interior room, the exterior wall of my house, and the house next door between the antenna and the transmitter 16 miles away. I gave the antenna a 50% chance of working. Well, I was surprised when it worked perfectly! After the channel scan, I had every one of the 57 channels that are available. Not only that, but the picture quality was outstanding and the audio clear and sharp. This antenna signal is as good as the roof mounted antenna that has an unobstructed view to the transmitter.",5,1,2020-7-23,1,1,1
I'm just writing to give you my feed back on this product.  I made this purchase to try and get some of our local TV channels outside of paying for it and I have to say im pleasantly surprised at how easy and quickly this antenna worked.

"Let me start by saying that I am 12 miles from Indianapolis, a city with all of the major stations. One would think I would be able to get them all without the amplifier, no problem. This is not the case. Without the amplifier, I lost 11 channels, one was the CBS range and another was the ABC range. But about the sensitivity of this product... At first, we put the antenna up in a sweet spot. It worked beautifully, 33 channels and they all came in crystal clear. (This was with the amplifier.) However, when I switched over to the FireStick, the tv started shutting itself off every 10-15 seconds and the FireStick wouldn’t respond to the remote. Thinking the amplifier might be the culprit, we took it off and lost the 11 channels. Thus began the hour-long saga of moving the antenna around, trying it with and without the amplifier, moving the wire around, everything we could think of, short of having my husband stand by the tv holding the antenna. It really seemed to like it when he held it. Eventually, we put it back in the original spot. Only, now it didn’t work there anymore. As long as my husband was near it, we could get all of the channels, but as soon as he walked away, *poof* the 11 channels were gone. Also, the wire is not well insulated, so it was open to any and all interference. For instance, we cannot have the lamps near the TV on while watching tv, because they make the signal break up. Another example, it would work fine with the wires on the front side of the lamp, but if we tried putting it behind the lamp (whether the lamp was on or not), it would lose channels. But the craziest of all was when my husband tried tacking the wire out of view, there’s this one wall that it apparently hates. If the wire was touching said wall, we got no signal. None.We finally found another sweet spot and the antenna is working beautifully again. No issues with the FireStick. (I don’t know what that was about.) Now, we are afraid to touch it, though. Honestly, if we decide to paint this room, I’m thinking we’re just going to paint over this sucker.",3,1,2020-2-7,1,1,0
"We recently moved from central PA to the southwest Florida area. In PA, we had a basic cable/Internet connection with an expensive and pathetic number of channels provided. Briefly, we had a few major stations, with the rest mostly religious, shopping, or required local access, for a total of 22. Mostly we just viewed the major stations, which we could also pick up via OTA. The reason we never just went with OTA was due to the cable franchise, as with other areas, having a strangle hold on everything, so they can do what they want and charge what they want. Once we contacted them and inquired about dropping the cable and just using them for the Internet. The cable company told us it was a ""bundled package"", and if we dropped the cable and only used them for Internet, they would charge us MORE than we were currently paying for both, as we no longer would have their wonderful ""bundled package"" !Now that we are in Florida, I did not want to repeat the same mistake of having an Internet provider's ""bundled package"". I was also told by a friend here the cable provider has just pushed a large cable increase onto their customers...imagine that. As I said before, I had tried a OTA in PA. It is a fairly expensive flat antenna stating with a ""W"".

I connected the GB HDTV Antenna to my cable tv connection on my LG TV and completed the hookup following the clear and accurate instructions included in the box. I have a USB port on my tv connections input panel and, for added convenience, I connected the GB HGTV USB power connector into it. There is a transformer included in the box for a wall plug-in, but for my hookup, there was no wall plug connection needed.  I then placed the antenna panel in a window and completed an on-air tv channel scan and to my great surprise, I was connected to 59 on-air channels and most of them were as clear HD as my cable picture TV was and without the iffy display of other on-air antennas that have to be moved for better reception every time the channel is changed.My wife and I are very pleased with the picture and sound provided with our GB HDTV Antenna and highly recommend it to all.

Right away, as soon as I plugged the Antenna in and turned the TV on, all of our channels showed up.  I didn't even have to rescan the channels.  The picture that I attached is one of the channels that we were having the hardest time getting.

I also like the little ‘magnetic’ adhesive at the base of the antenna sheet, which allows me to easily place the antenna at various spots on my window and relocate if and when needed whenever the signal is weak, without much of a hassle or a sticky mess.",5,1,2020-5-17,1,2,0
"I had low expectations for this antenna. As the Superbowl is coming and I don't pay for an expensive cable service, I hoped this antenna could get me the Fox 11 channel and I could watch the game on Sunday. The setup is fairly easy. I connected the coaxial cable to the back of my Fire stick TV and the USB power adapter to the electrical outlet. And I was ready to start a scan for channels. I didn’t bother to place the antenna close the  window because the coaxial cable provided isn’t long enough in my situation but I thought I could figure out something later. I just wanted to see if the antenna “worked’ and I could get some channels. To my surprise the scanning lasted about five minutes! I saw the scanning channels counting going for 10...20...30... until 132! I just couldn’t believe it! Still skeptical, I supposed the image quality wouldn’t be that great, but all the channels were crystal clear and all major networks were listed. My zip code is 92805 and I suppose others would get less or more channels but I highly recommend this antenna for those who don’t want to pay for cable.

"I have tried numerous HDTV antennas over the last few years and NONE of them could do what this one does!  I live in Houston and have access to over 100 HD channels through the air.  I have obtained over 100 channels with a few different antennas, but only about half of them were watchable.  This antenna comes with a booster that is very near the end of the cord, near the tv.  This allows me to utilize the LONG cable to mount the antenna as close to an outside wall or window as possible. I pulled in 109 channels with this antenna, and over 95% of them were clear and stable.  I have pared the down to the 45 or so channels that I might enjoy, but every single major channel comes in clear and is stable, day or night, rain or shine.

That is until yesterday when I installed my new Amplified HDTV. 60 seconds of plugging in the provided cables and positioning the antenna and I instantly had all the basic channels. I set the the TV to scan and it found almost 50 more. When you install yours be sure to keep it away from metal and don't be surprised if you have to move the antenna once or twice before you set it and forget it.Mr. Shin, Teacher",5,1,2020-4-24,1,1,0

"I was able to connect to local TV in less than 15 minutes and I have a better connection in an apartment than I had with local cable. (cable was interfering with cable to make me pay more).  This is a great product and the selection of TV shows is great for families and seniors trying to save on cable and get back to basics. I highly recommend this product.  Full disclosure my apartment faces north towards major city where I am 30 miles away. I have a under $300 HD smart TV and I attached the antenna to the  to the sliding door window, I cancelled cable tv just use the antenna now. I have to say this is a awesome  and has worked perfectly daily",5,1,2019-12-1,1,1,0
"I was so doubtful this product could live up to the reviews but I was totally wrong!  This is super easy to install, giving me a perfect picture that blew me away.I am now able to disconnect high priced packages that drain the budget .  With this wonderful find, I get so many crystal clear channels...for free!",5,1,2020-6-16,1,1,0
"Doubted but now believe.  Placed next to TV and got 9 channels.  Raised above TV and got 15.  The reception was iffy in both locations.  That's when I threw the antenna and cable up and onto the second floor walk over.  The antenna drapes over a half wall, railing facing a 3x4' window.  Scanned again and got 63 channels!  The alphabets and Fox come in perfect.  The pictures look much clearer than what they were with Dish.Watched Sumo wrestling Friday night.  Only problem now is finding out why my wife knows so much about Sumo wrestling!",5,1,2020-7-27,1,1,0
"When this HDTV antenna was delivered and I took it out the box, there is a 1 2 3 step and you are set, it's that easy. Program it and you get so many channels. I put mines in the living room window, and pick up even more channels. Its great everyone should have one.PS. After 3 months with this product. This antenna is sold by Abask Tech, yes it was easy to install, but you will have to move the it around the room from time to time to get a better reception. Doesn't work very well when it is thundering or raining very hard. And don't believe the company ( Gesobyte - Abask Tech ) when they add or send you a card saying how you can get a free antenna just by, sharing your experience on there email address, which is extra.hdtv@gmail.com, don't believe them. I never received one. But I guess ask with any antenna you are going to have your problem.",5,1,2020-5-7,1,1,0
"This is by far the best antenna I have used.. I bought a different brand a couple weeks ago that was a lil less expensive,  but absolutely horrible, so I returned it and bought this.. I was still a bit skeptical but when I plugged it in, (which is basically all you do it's super easy to set up), I was more than pleasantly pleased.  Not only did I get a TON more channels then the previous one, but the channels are super clear.  I haven't had any issues with pixelation nor gotten ANY ""no signal"" messages...I'm so glad I found this brand super happy with it...  You can't go wrong with this one!!",5,1,2020-6-11,1,2,0
"Just wanted to do a review about my HDTV Antenna that I ordered in February from Amazon. Well I wasn't in a rush to connect, so this is the reason for such a late review.We tried to connect it to my TV in the living room,  but didn't have the proper remote control and after researching it on the tube, will we still couldn't make it happen.",5,1,2020-5-11,1,1,0
"Wow!  I received my 4K antenna the other day.  The installation took seconds.  I then performed the automatic channel search and voila, there were immediately 62 digital channels available -- for FREE!  So far I am very satisfied.  I very likely will drop my very expensive cable package.  In addition, one of the best channels on cable TV is the Decades channel, which my new antenna picks up at no monthly charge!  Amazing!  I have been telling my friends about this terrific value for those who have had enough of the ever increasing cost of cable programming.  I should have ordered this antenna long ago.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,1,0
"Boy this is one great antenna! According to FCC I would be lucky to get 8 channels with an HD antenna. I plugged this baby in and WOW! I got over 60 channels of just about anything you can imagine. All local stations plus movie channels,sports channels, music channels, news channels etc. This is so much better than cable! Paired with my Netflix and Hulu accounts makes cable look like so yesterday! This is the future of tv. I so would recommend this antenna to anyone wanting to cut the cord. His antenna is what your looking for.",5,1,2020-6-17,1,2,0
"Got a recommendation from a friend and a gift suggesting that I purchase the (pictured) 200 Mile Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna. What a Find! To economize, I've tried everything, various APPS, Sticks, DVD Players, Renting movies, etc., while all good I've missed the Free Local ""Live"" TV Stations, NO MORE!!! This Product is Really Worth its value price, its easy to install and the picture quality is GREAT! Try it, it is my feeling, that you won't be disappointed!Find out what cutting the cable really means!  Thanks, friend and thanks Gesobyte!!!",5,1,2020-8-16,1,1,1
This excellent product arrived within 24 hours and more importantly iin time for Thursday night football.Upon cutting the cord with a recent move I was caught flatfooted as football started and I didn't have local channels.  Gesobyte stepped in with an outstanding product.  It took me less than 5 minutes to pick the best spot for the antenna and connect it to my tv and voila my football night was saved!,5,1,2020-9-13,1,1,0
"It works for me!!! I get more “buffering” from my Spectrum app than from this antenna! (The buffering is extremely rare!)I am enjoying this antenna very much. I have it in a room on the first floor of my house, in my home office, and the window is facing another house, which is probably only 10 or 12 feet away. When I first set it up, I thought this would probably not work, because the next door house would block the signal! And at first it was buffering quite a bit, so I kept moving the antenna. After just 3 different locations, it started working very well, and I have been very pleased with it! Now I just need a couple more for my other TVs!",5,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0
"I purchased two of these for televisions in different areas of the house. They were easy to install and work like the old rabbit ears antenna, but more powerful. I only cared about networks, like ABC, NBC, etc. I live about 20 miles from downtown St. Louis and this antenna recognizes about 30 channels on any given day. The networks are clear, hi-def.Installation requires a bit of understanding of your television's capabilities. Both my tv's are smart and it was easy to find the setting to switch to this antenna rather than another source. Then, the tv has to search for available channels, which takes about 5 minutes. Then, you can start changing channels and watching tv.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0
"We just signed up to Dish, and I was shocked to discover that the local channels didn't come in the basic package. When I called about it, the tech advised that I just buy an antenna, $20 or $25 is all it would take to get the local channels and because we had free 6 months extended service plan when we signed up, if we needed help installing it, they would come out and do it for us.So we ordered this and followed the simple instructions, but still needed help. When the tech came out, he had a series of adapters  to choose from, and the adapter cost us an extra $48, but that saves us $12 a month to get the local channels, and it works on all four TV's in the house, plus the channels channels show up on the guide, so we are happy.",5,1,2020-2-26,1,1,0
"Unbelievable!!  Unbelievably simple to install and unbelievable reception quality after its installation.Here in Texas, on DirecTV, we tend to lose satellite every time we have a ‘little’ rain or some excessive wind gusting.  Now, when I lose cable, I change my TV input option from HDMI 1 to Antenna and BOOM - I’m getting local weather info on my local channels and still getting 65 channels to calm the family down when they lose their ‘TV fix’.",5,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
"I bought this to replace the old one from another seller here because it broke from my toddler being a toddler. One I had before was really nice, unfortunately I wasn’t available so I went to the next best one with good ratings, which was this one. Unfortunately I only got 6 channels, 3 of which didn’t work. My previous antenna had at least 20 channels 90% of them worked well. So obviously I’m returning this and will wait till the other one comes in stock.",1,1,2020-4-2,1,2,0
I am a Dish customer and recently we lost Channel 13 Apollo. Not one time have I ever thought of using an antenna I decided to buy this antenna on Amazon it has been the best experience of my life instead of going with another provider I am now thinking about cutting the cord. As soon as I plugged it in which was exactly like the picture directed truly simple. For a person with no tech savvy experience the channels picked up immediately. You have truly made this happy empty nester happy. Without kids and always working I have no reason for high cable bills with the help of your antenna and Netflix and Amazon Prime I am proud to say I'm becoming a cord cutter. Truly thankful,5,1,2020-8-16,1,1,0
"I get the same 9 channels that I get with the $12.00 antenna I got from Walmart. I was hoping for at least a couple more channels. I live 30 miles from BatonRouge, 5 miles from Hammond and 50 from New Orleans. I have only given great reviews in the past from anything I've bought from Amazon but this thing is a HUGE disappointment..",1,1,2020-2-10,1,3,0
"I have been using the Antenna since December 2019 with no issues. I am super pleased with the picture quality on the screen and the quantity of channels I am able to watch. This has been by far one my favorite purchases to date on Amazon. No need to pay for monthly cable to watch the same channels with the same picture quality. My antenna is located on the wall of my third floor apartment near a window. I was skeptical that the antenna would not work being that I live in an apartment that has a total of 6 floors, but to my surprise, the antenna worked perfectly. The set up was easy. I just read the instructions on how to set up and I was watching tv in less than 10 minutes!Thank you for a quality product! I can see why this HGTV Antenna has countless of wonderful reviews!",5,1,2020-3-12,1,1,0
"I absolutely love this antenna!  Way better than the more expensive ones that I have purchased in the past.  So pleasantly surprised after I installed this antenna on my T.V. and seen I am now getting 50+ clear channels.  My 1 year old antenna that I paid alot more for only gave me 5-6 channels.I can actually say ""time to ditch the cable. ""  Because, I am now getting more stations with this antenna than I do with cable.  PLUS there are more stations that I actually like versus what was available on my basic cable.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,1,0
"I’ve got this antenna to replace an existing amplified antenna that I currently have. There were channels like NBC that I was not getting with my old antenna. As soon as I received this amplified HD TV antenna I connected it to my TV, mounted the antenna on my sliding glass door, rescanned  and I was able to get NBC! The picture  on the channels I receive comes in clear and sharp.  I appreciated the long length of the wire connecting the antenna to my antenna in on my 4K TV.  I wasn’t sure what to expect with this antenna but I am very happy with it.",5,1,2020-4-28,1,1,0
"We absolutely ""LOVE"" the Free HDTV Antenna! We live in the country, and satellite is the only option for television. However, satellite can get pretty expensive when you have a different receiver for each room. I ordered this antenna from Amazon, it arrived quickly, and I had it installed in less than 10 minutes! Our guestroom now has about 48, perfectly clear channels. When our kids and grand kids are visiting, they can now watch their own shows in the guestroom. They are perfect for putting in the motorhome/RV, etc. as well. I highly recommend the Free HDTV Antenna!",5,1,2020-3-11,1,1,0
"I recently cut the cable cord which was terminated on Feb 1st.  I had ordered this digital indoor antenna from Amazon but had not hooked it up.  Then it was suddenly February 2nd, Super Bowl Sunday.  I was so used to the cable being attached, it didn't dawn on me until around 10 minutes before the game that it wasn't.  I quickly hooked up the antenna to my 60"" TV.  Without attaching the amplifier to the antenna, I turned on the TV just in time for the game and was absolutely AMAZED at the quality of the picture.  I could have sworn my cable HD was still attached, but it was only this antenna that was producing the sharp image.I'm going to order two more of these antennas for other TVs in the house.  Thanks or a great product.",5,1,2020-2-25,1,1,0
"This antenna is amazing! My cable rates were recently increased again and my bill was almost $250 a month. This of course is included Internet and phone service, but is still ridiculously expensive. When I called the cable company to try and negotiate a lower bill, the gentleman that was helping me told me that since I have been a loyal customer for 30 years, I had actually been a customer longer than he had been alive. And they still could do nothing to lower my bill. I took a leap of faith and get rid of my phone service and my cable boxes and tried this product. I was completely shocked by the amount of channels I get and the amazing picture quality. I am kicking myself for not doing it sooner, and I’m extremely happy that I finally did it. I am telling everyone I know about this antenna.",5,1,2020-2-20,1,1,0
"Bought this package mainly for the inline amp but for the money, the antenna came with it. I have a roof antenna that needed the amp but decided to play with the one included. I live in a valley and just stuck it on a window on the first floor to try it out. Totally surprised to receive 22 channels. Entire hook up took less than 5 minutes. Pictures crystal clear and, while I do have Youtube TV which gives me the big 4 networks from Philadelphia, I get all the locals in addition to some distant ones. Quite pleased. Going to put this up in the attic and combine with the roof antenna to see what happens.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,1,0

"Due to expenses I had no choice but to cut the cable cord. This was a very unenthusiastic decision to make. I thought I’d never get decent tv again. The kids took this the hardest. We went for a awhile with fuzzy broadcasts of a few channels. It was stressful. I decided to give this antenna a try since it could be connected indoors and had decent reviews.I am AMAZED at the reception this HD TV antenna gets! Instead of getting a few fuzzy channels, I was able to find exceptional airplay for LOTS OF THEM. What a relief.",5,1,2020-9-9,1,1,0
"We received the antenna two days ago and set it up last night. The instructions were a cinch. 1, 2, 3 and we had it working. Plugged the amplifier into the power source on a power strip, screwed the coaxial cable into the antenna plug it the back or our really old Samsung 47 inch TV. Went to settings, set the selector on air/DTV on ours, and ran the setup program. It scrolled through and detected 21 channels and off we went. The picture on most channels is more High Def then cable for sure. Really cool. We stuck the flat antenna to a window behind a curtain and we were done!Great product!! Would do it again.",5,1,2020-4-4,1,1,0
"This antenna was very easy to install, and came with any connectors you need, and simple instructions. We have used this antenna for over a month, and recommend you discover where your nearest tower is on google maps, face your antenna toward it, by a window and high up if you can. It may take a couple of channel scans, but this is working perfectly for us, even in a multi-unit building in an urban setting.",5,1,2020-3-18,1,2,0
"I do like this antenna.  It has a long cord, so the antenna can reach towards the window or wall.  In addition, it has an amplifier in line which is being powered by USB on the TV which is convenient, because I don’t have to plug it in (it did come with a plug adapter if you need it).  In addition, it is working in line with an additional amplifier which I already had.  It is getting in channels from about 20 miles away and it is doing a better job than the rabbit ears that I had.  I am happy with this product, and the purchase that I made.  I would like a longer cord, but overall, i am satisfied.",4,1,2020-4-4,1,1,0
"I needed an indoor antenna (outdoor isn’t an option for me) and was concerned that the only window I could attach the antenna to faces the woods. I decided to try this affordable one before springing for a more expensive antenna. I’m so glad I did! It was very easy to hook up and I was pleased to get 39 channels! After having it a few days, I lost my PBS channels and some of the main channels (ABC, NBC) started getting glitchy. I contacted customer support, who replied very quickly. After repositioning the antenna (the stickers still worked after moving it a few times) & rescanning, I got my channels back. There are still the occasional glitches, but overall, the picture is better than cable and I get to watch the network shows I like, plus local news. Bye, bye cable!",5,1,2020-1-29,1,1,0
"I checked the government website to see what channels were available in my area. It came back zero. I have plaster walls but decided to try it anyway. I attached to the wall, set the signal for long range and scanned. I immediately received 27 channels. Moved it again and I have 38! Picture quality is as good as cable. I’m so glad I purchased this item.  There are a lot of channels I don’t  care about even when I had cable but at least I can now watch local news and get the weather. If I could attach to a window I bet I’d have more channels but I love how discreetly it’s hidden behind my Samsung 4K TV. This is a must for cable cutters.",5,1,2020-6-26,1,1,0
"I really like this antenna, and I believe it works for my application because we are within 30 miles of the towers.  I'm not sure if it would work for much more.  I will say that the coax is definitely not long for our house, but I was able to get a connector to connect an additional 20 ft of coax.  Since the towers are Northeast of our house and we have a brick house, I located the antenna in our small frame addition.  When I did that, we now have more than 50 channels.  I would recommend with antenna for thirty or so miles, but I cannot vouch for a greater distance.",4,1,2020-6-1,1,1,0
"I bought this antenna to use in my guest room for the 43"" Philips 4K/HDR TV. The superior performance was immediately apparent. I ended up moving it to my main TV (65"" Philips 4K/HDR) since it was better than the ONG antenna I had on it. The unique flexible design offers some interesting mounting options. I used the provided velcro strips to attach it to the back of the TV. This also pulled in the lower stations (channel 3-1, 3-2 and 3-3) that the other antenna didn't pull in..Great Product!! Great Vaiue!!",5,1,2020-9-13,1,1,0
"I recieved my antenna a few weeks ago. I was excited to hook it up and see if the reception promised was true. I was greatly disappointed when I opened the package to discover it was a previously used item. Paying nearly $28 I expect to purchase an item that is NEW. Sadly, this has happened with other items purchased from Amazon. Looking at the ad on Amazon again, I have to be honest, I am not sure it's the same one. I wanted this one because it states that it was new updated for 2020 and had a range of 120+ miles. I went ahead and hooked it up to see what would happen. I already have one with a 50 mile range. This one does the same as it. I was wanting to hook up all four of my TV sets but now I am looking to purchase from someone who will not send out previously used (returns) to customers who are expecting a new item for their money. $28 dollars may not be much for some but for others, it is.",3,1,2020-1-31,1,1,0

"I tried four other antennas prior to coming across this one.  The others all failed to bring in all the channels available in my area. This one gets them all and with no interference whatsoever, crystal clear. One very minor drawback.  This antenna comes with 18 feet of cord, which is great; but in my particular case I could have used another three or four feet.  Fortunately, I already had an extension cord and adapter, which gave me the extra length I needed and worked great.  Save yourself the trouble of trying other brands and get this one to begin with!",5,1,2020-7-19,1,1,0
"I just received my Gesobyte antenna and installed it.  Installation was just as expected by plugging the USB cable into the back of my TV for power and screwing in the coaxial cable to the back of the TV, done! My new TV had very little information on setting up my local channels with an actual antenna, so I checked the instructions that were included in the Gesobyte antenna's packaging and it explained what I should be looking for on my TV setup screen.  Once I found that, a click or two later is was scanning for channels and found over 100 channels that I didn't have before! I still have cable access on this second TV, but will be cancelling that shortly!  Outstanding quality product, easy setup and installation with cable quality picture, without the cable costs. Love this Gesobyte antenna!",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"Let me tell you, we ordered two other ones that were more expensive.  They don't come in or work as clear and as good as this one does!  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was extremely easy to install with great directions.  It even came with sticky dots for the different parts.  I was so excited when I could get 20 channels and we are almost 20 miles from the main town.  They come in crystal clear!  There are no interruptions and no freezing screens.  I get all of the main channels, ABC, NBC, Fox, etc.  Thank you so much for making a great product!  I will definitely refer you to my friends and family",5,1,2020-6-6,1,1,0
"I purchased this antenna because I was having major issues with my former cable provider. I was  a bit skeptical because I had never used a digital antenna before. I was shocked when my television looked better than my cable TV!! The channels were clear, vivid, and had a beautiful color due to the HD !! One thing I did dislike which may be due to my area was that there were some channels that were not spoken in my language but it was well worth the money for the quality and the channels which were about 60+ total for my area. The stations that I did catch were great!! Honestly, if it was not for my family loving cable I would ditch the cable bill and stick to this !! Great buy!",5,1,2020-7-30,1,1,0

"I installed my Gesobyte HDTV Antenna today that I ordered from Amazon.  It was the highest rated and review HDTV Antenna on Amazon and for good reason!  I have purchased other HDTV Antennas in the past and I have been disappointed.  I even bought separate signal amplifiers, but with the Gesobyte HDTV Antenna I got a clear picture for every station available in my area the moment I turned on my television.  The picture quality is amazing.  It comes built in with a signal amplifier with two modes, short and long range!  This is a great HDTV Antenna.",5,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0
"I bought my antenna from Amazon in February with little hope that it was going to work.  I inherited my mom's flat-screen TV which is not a smart TV.  I tried to connect it with NetFlix and my Amazon firestick, but not even the USB port would work with anything. Not my laptop, not my smartphone.So it seemed like I was going to be stuck with a TV that I couldn't use and I didn't want to pay my satellite tv company more money for a TV that doesn't get watched enough to justify the cost. My brother-in-law was telling me about an antenna that he bought that had a flat black panel on it and it was able to get him several local channels for free.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,1,0
"So I'm trying to ""cut the cord"" since cable TV has become an expense I can no longer justify.  This antenna was easy to install.  Literally the hardest part was figuring out my TV remote to re-scan for air channels.  When I finally figured it out I had over 100 channels.  All the locals that love and crystal clear.  Why do people pay for cable TV?  I mean yeah there are some cable channels that I'd like to have but my cable/internet bill jumped to over $220/mo.  By time this is over I'll have everything I needed before for less than $100.  It's not as instant as turn on the TV and see a picture, but the inconvenience is NOT worth $1500/year.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,1,0
"Since I'm not very technical, I had reservations about installing this antenna by myself.  I should not have been concerned at all.  I moved my television into my second bedroom, followed the instructions, and the next thing I knew I had over 50 channels I could watch without cable.  The setup itself just took a few minutes - pretty much plug and play - it took a little while to go through the television set up to find all the channels (because there were a lot).  I live about 5 miles from the tower.  The picture is perfect.  I am very pleased and will recommend this antenna if anyone ever asks me for suggestions about antennas.",5,1,2020-6-24,1,1,1
"We purchased the antenna for a spare bedroom that is not used often, so we wanted to get a television that we did not have to pay for extra cable. The unit was set up very easily. It got us about 33 channels that we did not get before. It works perfectly for a spare guest room.",5,1,2019-11-3,1,4,0
"It's really easy to setup but you have to test around if you need the amplifier or not so that took me more time finding which is better.  I like that it looks sleek and doesn't get in the way like the rabbit ears.  I didn't attach it to the wall, there are few times when there's a skip in some channels and if I move it around it's fine.  They have a deal if you write a review then you get a free antenna once you send them the review.  It's probably why there's so many reviews for this.  It is the reason I am writing this review to be honest.  Overall it's easy to setup and works well and inexpensive so it's worth it.",4,1,2020-3-12,1,1,0
"Got this hd amplified tv antenna by Gesobyte thru abask on Amazon. I tried an outdoor roof mounted name brand model but it only got 3 channels mounted in the  peak of roof. We don’t live in a great reception area with mountains east & west of us. I tried this 2020 version hd amp Tv antenna at first laying on a table & didn’t get much. Then I decided to add 25’ of coax so I could put it on our sliding glass door (they recommend installing on window). It auto programmed 30 channels! Using the plug in adapter for the usb & enjoying local networks with clear picture, news, old movies & shows etc. Great antenna! Highly recommended, just try it on a window facing the towers if possible.",5,1,2020-8-4,1,1,1
"I received my powered HDTV antenna and was able to get it set up very quickly. I just plugged it into my TV and the power cord into my TVs USB slot, and set my TV to scan. I definitely noticed that this antenna was able to receive more channels than another, un-powered antenna I had from before. The higher I placed this antenna, the more channels I was able to scan for. So I’m very pleased with this one, and recommend it. The picture quality is excellent and it was convenient that they included a piece of adhesive so I could stick this to the wall behind my TV.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,1,0
"I have an old 43 inch flatscreen television in the basement. It is not hooked up to cable, and I wanted something for the grandkids to be able to watch. I Purchased this antenna hoping it would get me at least four or five channels. Oh my gosh. It worked great even in the BASEMENT.  I was able to get 16 channels with it. I had a coax cable that ran from the basement up to the living room, so I hooked The coax to the back of the television and took the antenna upstairs to the living room and placed it in the window. Now I get 25 channels. All crystal clear. Twice as good as I ever expected it would be, and 10 times better than the old antennas. Thank you so much. I’m very satisfied with my purchase and the price was great. It was super easy to install. It uses the USB power from the back of your television set. I have never been happier with an Antenna purchase",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,1
"Let me start by saying I had a very cheap antenna that was included in another product.  It wasn't good at all.  Signal quality of various channels varied constantly.  I eventually got reasonable reception when I hung it outside a window (silly thing to do).  I was gone for a few days, and when I came back the wind had ripped the antenna off the coax.  Funny thing is, the bare coax wire worked better than when the  antenna was connected.So, I got this one.  Connected it (left it indoors) and ran a channel scan.  I now have several new channels I didn't have before (80 in total), and with excellent signal quality.  There is only one channel that isn't great.  But it is located in South Carolina (I'm in Brooklyn NY).  I don't want to watch that channel, I'm just amazed I receive it.",5,1,2020-5-31,1,1,0
"I have been a 40 year cable subscriber but grew up in a household with a roof antenna. I finally decided to make a break from the constant growing cable bills from my local provider. With online streaming TV available I needed an alternative for my local channels in order to view local news but mostly for my local sports teams. I did some investigating online regarding local air wave availability since I'm 30 miles south of the broadcast towers in Seattle, I wasn't sure what I could receive? I had previously bought a digital antenna that I had seen on TV but had no luck dialing in any quality channels as they advertised so I returned it. Without expectation I purchased a U Must Have indoor HDTV antenna, I hooked it up with out the booster and was surprised that I got 3 times as many channels as the other one I purchased. I was pretty excited and mounted it on the front window of my house and then added the booster in which I thought would make it even better. I auto-programmed my TV again and then tried it but found that many channels wouldn't come in. I was a bit frustrated as to why after adding the booster did I get worse reception? I pulled the antenna from the window and began moving it around the room to find the picture and the number of channels greatly improved! Seems the  reception for different channels can be improved with a little patience and some experimenting. Thanks to the long chord, I was able to find the ""sweet spot"" and now I'm thrilled with the picture quality and moved forward in cutting my cable dependency. I don't ever have to pay for local channels again and also have the ability to take it in my camper as well. I would recommend this antenna, if you are in a location similar to myself and want freedom from the cable monopoly. Thank you,  I found myself searching freely through the channels and it took me back to fond memories of my childhood.",5,1,2020-2-13,1,1,0
"I bought this specifically to get PBS at my parent's home (in the California Central Valley) which was 86 miles from that tower.  Tried many different locations in the house, including different rooms.  Tried different TVs.  Could not get that station.  I did get that station with my old Mohu and old Vizio TV from my kitchen.  So those were left at my parent's house.  I bought a new kitchen TV and with this antenna I get 92 stations.  I am 27-59 miles from the various towers.  Gave 4 stars because they advertise 150 miles and we definitely didn't get that.  Good product besides that.",4,1,2020-7-12,1,1,0
"So we currently have the ol' rabbit ears which we have had for a number of years now. Decided to upgrade to this new ""earless"" model. Installed this antenna in all of about 5 minutes. Upon first channel search we got loads of channels, same number as we currently have so I knew we weren't missing any. We didn't even mount the antenna- just laid it on top of the entertainment center. (Now I'm wondering if we would get more channels by mounting??). And I have to say, the picture is incredibly clear and brilliant. Very, very pleased with this upgrade.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
"We absolutely love our antenna!  We had one, bought one for my parents house and bought an additional for our house.  We live in a rural part of the country and we don’t have unlimited data for our internet.  This gives us the opportunity to save data for streaming and allows us to watch local channels and football for free!  We really have very few issues with signal and this antenna exceeded our expectations.  It is a must have for people who stream their tv!!!!!!!",5,1,2020-9-24,1,1,0
"I had a non-amplified antenna first, very similar in style, but didn't quite get all the stations.  I then purchased a much larger outdoor amplified antenna and it got all the stations, but every station was intermittent, including ones that were perfectly clear before.  Finally switched to this antenna and now I get all the stations perfectly fine.  Even with the amplifier off it does a better job than the first two antennas I tried, but it still needs the amplifier to get some of the further out towers.  This is a great antenna, and it comes with a nice long cord allowing for lots of placement options depending on needs.  Also great that it came with a USB power supply as I have another device already using the only USB port on the TV.",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"Changed from an old antenna that was 3 or 4 years old. Used to receive around 65-70 channels.  I am now getting 92 (a lot of which are spanish).  Picture quality on the HD channels that are broadcast are great quality, others are just so so, not to the fault of the antenna, just that those stations are not broadcast in HD. Installation was simple. Make sure you move the antenna around to find the optimal position. I'm in an apartment and could not get many channels mounting on wall. I have it on the sliding glass door.",5,1,2020-4-27,1,1,0
"I finally had the courage  to “Cut The Cable”. I purchase a different make digital antenna and installed it on one of my TV’s. With the exception of ABC, I was able to scan and get local channels but the reception left much to be desired. the pictures pixilated and would come in and out. I tried moving the antenna but nothing worked.I wanted to try another antenna for my 2nd TV.  I looked at the reviews on Amazon and this model was rated #1. It was an easy install and when I scanned for channels, I was in for a huge surprise. I got ABC and 69 other channels. The",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"Really an exceptional antenna for HD reception. Surprised how many channels it picks up in the Phoenix area here; way more than 30. Can vary between 45 and 60 depending on directional position of antenna. Also, it gets some oldies channels I cannot get with my Cox cable here, so I am keeping it. I'll just flip between the two, which is how I have it set up. I do enjoy my cable for the Discovery and other cable channels and will keep both. But, if your on a budget for a while, then you'll save big time canceling your cable and using this for free. Within the first two weeks it pays itself off.Enjoy!",4,1,2019-12-23,1,1,0
"The world of free tv came to us.  I have plans to remove cable at some point and really hoped that this would be a good answer for us.  We have been exploring several options, but local channels are the key.  All of them are available and very clear.Plugged it in, remembered to search channels and at first got about 40 but some were not as clear as expected. I moved the antenna to a different part of the wall and reset the channels, 61 DTV and all clear as HD can make them.",5,1,2020-3-28,1,1,0
"I am kicking myself for not purchasing this antenna earlier. The reception is fabulous, and I no longer have to pay a small fortune every month just to watch the local stations. I’m a senior citizen on a fixed income so this purchase has made a real difference for me financially. Thank you for providing such a great product.",5,1,2020-7-6,1,2,0
This is great no more paying to watch TV and Commercials had just got a second TV for the Bedroom cable wanted $275 for a second hook up saw this antenna on Amazon and decided it was worth a try I get a great picture on all the local channels in fact i did not know we had this many off air must be at least 20-25 was up and running in 10 minutes the amp powers off the USB in so just need 1 outletget one you will save i wrote this and i approve this review,5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
"Bottom line: It is better than the 50mile rated antenna we had, good enough that we still don't need to pay for TV, but don't expect to receive the claimed 200 mile range.Just moved and the antenna we had (50mile rated) wasn't picking up any stations.  This antenna was the longest rated range available so tried it.  The antenna itself seems about the same, so probably just has a more powerful amplifier.  It is still very sensitive to weather and antenna placement (picked up about half as many channels in a window 5 feet away from where we finally left it, works better for us facing North/South).  Generally, it is picking up some Milwaukee stations clearly (37 miles away) and in clear weather some Chicago stations (50 miles away) although the picture and audio from Chicago tends to drop out frequently (they don't come in at all if it's raining) so I don't really consider those channels watchable.  Not really any hills or obstructions in the geography here so I would expect that to further reduce your range.",4,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"We're a cord-cutting household and watch ALL of our tv through apps (Amazon Prime, Netflix, HBO, Disney, etc.).  I'm a huge football fan, and the only problem with not having cable is that I can't watch local games.  Easy fix!  Get yourself the Gesobyte digital antenna and the problem is solved.  Now, not only do I have access to all the local games, we can now watch live tv with a large selection.  My antenna picked up 171 different channels.  Do yourself a favor, get rid of your cable bill and get yourself this antenna.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
"I purchased my HD Antenna from Amazon and very excited when I received it.The package came, I opened it and unboxed.

Being in a major metropolitan area I have had issues in the past with receiving TV channels. I currently replaced a outdoor/roof mounted TV antenna because airplanes were causing issues with my TV signal when they passed over. I installed this TV antenna and plugged in the USB and I was happy to see that the channels appear as crisp as ever. So far so good on the airplanes passing overhead not effecting the signal of the channels either. I would highly recommend this to anyone in need of a reliable antenna. It also looks very sleek as well!,5,1,2020-4-13,1,1,0
So this antenna advertises 120 mile range and that is completely bogus. I live just 17 miles from the TV towers and I can't even get a solid signal on the VHF channels. They constantly go in and out with a warning that pops up saying I have a poor signal. I placed the antenna in several different areas trying to get a good signal but it is impossible because the antenna is just too weak. The advertised 120 miles is just laughable and they should change the description to more accurately show it's real range which seems to be a maximum of 15 miles.,1,1,2020-2-7,1,1,0

"This is a great antenna! It literally took less than 10 minutes to set up. Once scanned, I have 99 channels and a great picture. I also appreciate the velcro tabs that are included-they allowed me to fasten the antenna securely high on my bedroom window for maximum reception. Awesome!",5,1,2019-12-11,1,2,0
"Having used previous flat screen antennas, I thought this might only be a slight improvement, but I was wrong!  This antenna is phenomenally great!  No need to attach to a window in order to capture stations, this one can be placed on a wall and does not rely as strongly on directional receiving.We are about 20 miles from Oklahoma City TV transmitting towers, and when we installed this inside of a room without directional windows towards the city, we mounted it on a wall behind the TV and the auto-select function of the TV picked up 42 stations, the bulk of which were Digital!  AWESOME!",5,1,2019-11-17,1,1,0
"The antenna system and its parts are well made, quality parts.  Even the box and enclosed instructions are well done in presentable English with useful images.  It took me only 15 minutes to set it up.  I placed the antenna in the window closest to my Samsung 4K TV.  According to the FCC tables, there are about 30 stations transmitting from locations up to 30 miles from me.  This antenna picked up all of them.  I am astounded, and happy.  I want to cut the cable cord and move on to streaming.  This antenna will make my plan that much easier and save me some money, too.",5,1,2019-11-7,1,2,0
"I did a Google search for the best TV antenna...this one came up every time & so I read the reviews & some were good, some were not.  It was more negative responses than I cared for but with the 120-mile reception, I had to give it an effort.  I am in a good area & can get up to 35-40 channels but nothing on this one.  I used the amplifier & did not use it on both TV's & nothing...didn't even recognize there was an antenna connected.I have hooked up multiple TV's for myself & family & can work my way around all the settings...I am just so disappointed as I was looking to be able to get more channels with the 120-mile reception claimed in the specifications of this antenna.  Thankful to Amazon, that I can return it & I hate to return anything.",1,1,2020-2-16,1,1,0
My old antenna only found 13 channels. This antenna found 30. I didn’t even know most of the new channels existed. Throw in the fact that the picture looks a million times better and you can’t beat this deal.,5,1,2019-12-12,1,2,0
This antenna is excellent.  I was only hoping to get a few channels but was suprised to get 18and I live in a rural area. Excellent picture quality.  Saving me over one hundred dollars a month. We getting rid of cable tv...cutting the cord!,5,1,2019-10-31,1,1,0
"I purchased antenna with an 18 foot coax cable, equipped with the versatility to position it on a highly receptive occasional table.  Now the Roku’s new antenna receives signal from several local stations, my finicky housemate stays entertained and rarely makes a sound, and I oft retreat to my study for hours on end without being found.  Sometimes, though, particularly after a strong thunderstorm, the signal does seem to shift, requiring me to adjust the antenna here and there just a little bit.  My old antennas did not receive nearly as good reception as this new one.  There are lots of old trees in my suburban-ish urban neighborhood, and I think I’m on a subtle opposite-facing slope… so it was difficult to find a really decent antenna and not lose hope.  I am quite pleased with this purchase, and will likely purchase a second.  At times I roguishly grin as I revel in this win, and thank my lucky stars for leading me to an antenna that feels no less than empyrean.My only consternation is that I purchased only one; for unlike my housemate, if I miss the evening news my day doesn’t feel done.  Nearly every evening he hogs the Roku with this great antenna after work, and sprawls upside down on my couch as if poised to perform a lazy man’s twerk.  I flee to the sanctuary of my study, hoping to avoid this eccentric buddy.  The old antenna and TV are there, but they haven’t much life to spare.",5,1,2020-2-17,1,1,0
"I really don’t understand all the great reviews for this antenna. I bought it based on the reviews, hoping to get better reception than the RCA antenna I got locally. Picture quality was similar and I still have dropouts but now I get 4 less channels than I did with the RCA. Tried several different locations in the house before mounting high in a window next to where the RCA was located as this gave me the most channels and strongest reception but still less than the RCA.",3,1,2020-8-25,1,1,0
"After dealing with fuzzy picture from an old ""bunny ears"" antenna for years, I decided to pull the trigger on getting one of these digital antennas. I was skeptical at first, which is why I put it off for so long, thinking it wouldn't be much better, but seeing as how many 5 star reviews there are, I decided it was worth a shot. The reviews aren't lying! Super easy setup, just connect a couple pieces together then plug into your TV and like magic the picture is crystal clear. I used to get only around 15-20 channels, but now I am seeing dozens that I didn't have before. Really great product, recommend!",5,1,2020-5-29,1,1,0
"The Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna Long 200 Miles Range - Support 4K 1080p is super easy to connect and reaches to the other side of the room if you need it that way.  It found 86 channels in my area, though I don't watch every one, but I am very happy to replace the one that would not work in the same place each day.  Also, the reception seems much clearer on all the channels.  I love the antenna shape because it can be placed behind a tapestry on the wall if you don't like it for decor, and it still works without adjustment!  A great purchase in my book!",5,1,2020-7-20,1,1,0
"If it weren't for my terrain, this would have been one of the best purchases I've made in awhile (I am in a bit of a valley).  Even with that situation, this antenna picked up dozens of local digital channels that I had no idea even existed in my area!  While not really designed for outdoor mounting, I tried raising it higher on a pole, just for grins, and it found 73 channels!  Had I not been blocked by houses on a hill between me and the city, I'd have gotten all those channels with this sitting in a windows.  Unfortunately, I need to move to a more robust outdoor antenna that I can mount on my roof, just because of my situation.  But, if you have a mostly clear path to your broadcast antennas, this indoor TV antenna will make the decision to ""cut the cord"" VERY easy.  Couple it with a USB tuner and software, and turn an old PC or your XBOX into a DVR/Streaming device for your home.",5,1,2020-9-10,1,1,0
"I received my Antenna a few days ago. The packaging was a slim profile, with all pieces neatly packed in the box. Contents included everything needed for setup as well as some materials for cord management and mounting. Setup was easy and I liked the option of drawing power from the tv with the usb cable or from wall outlet power. The channel search tool several minutes, a little longer than I expected at around 10 minutes, but the Antenna did pick up about 15 digital channels for my area I. Long Beach, MS. I moved the Antenna a little closer to the window and was able to pick up a few more after searching again. I think the Antenna would pick up more if I mounted it higher, but that wouldn’t look great with my living room setup. The channels that I did pick up come in very clear and provide a steady signal. Definitely recommend for the cost and quality.",5,1,2019-12-18,1,1,0
I recently purchased this HDTV antenna to work with Sling TV. I received one from them that I didn’t realize only has a 30 mile range. I recently purchased yours and received 10 more channels for a total of 19. I finally got the channels I wanted. This is by far the best product I’ve purchased. This along with Sling has allowed me to save $100 a month because I dropped Direct TV.,5,1,2020-2-3,1,2,0
"The package arrived on time with no issues. Everything needed for setup was included in the package with clear instructions. There is a booster for those that live far from the signal sources which I didn't need for my location but it's nice they include the option. The cords were long enough to locate the antenna wherever you needed it as well. There is an option of up to 90 minutes of ""DVR"" if you use a HIGH SPEED USB stick (not included). I have no need for this currently so I didn't bother setting it up but its another nice feature.It was very easy to hook up and to program the channels. Took less than 15 minutes to find a location to mount it on the wall behind the TV and to program the channels. Included are permanent style adhesive pads to mount the antenna on the wall/window but I ended up using removable/ semi-permanent style adhesives to prevent paint damage when removed in the future.",5,1,2020-7-24,1,1,1

"Really eager to get rid of cable, I read through reviews (on Amazon and off) and am really surprised how bad the reception is.  I live in the DFW area and should be receiving strong signals, but the signals I receive with this HDTV antenna provide unsteady pictures and sometimes missing audio.  It's just not something I can watch without great frustration or nausea.  The item comes with a signal booster and with it on or off there is no difference to the audio/visual on my TV.  So I've got to find something else, because this particular product is just garbage and I don't believe all the ""stars"" is truthful.  Can't possibly be.  So purchase at your own risk.

I just got this today from Amazon. Installation was easy and it works flawlessly so far. I replaced an indoor digital antenna that is rated for 60 miles and it worked but tended to cut out quite frequently which is to be expected as are about 69 miles from the tower.

"Won't be as simple as it seems.. Not as advertised. Seller claimed that this antenna has '130+ Miles' range. Not true. It does not even see TV stations within 15 miles. I live in Fairfax in Northern Virginia. There are over 100 TV stations within 130 miles from me. Yet, this antenna receives only 14 channels total. It is installed by the window on the second floor, with no obstruction whatsoever. There are no hills, no tall buildings, and no mountains around here. And no tree obstruction either.  Yet, no matter the location of the antenna, it only receives no more that 14 channels.  The seller claimed antenna boasts 4K reception. Not true. I have 4K Ultra UHD TV.  Yet, most of the 14 channels are 480i; and about 3 are in 720p. The highest resolution it can receive is 1080i for two channels; not even 1080p, and not even close to 4K.

"I purchased my antenna from Prime to use expressly when my internet goes out so I can still watch tv. Using primarily Netflix, prime, and Alexa gives me limited access to regular tv shows and programming. When internet goes out, I have nothing. I am disabled and almost completely bed bound, so you can only imagine how important having tv to watch is for me.My son had it hooked up in only minutes, scanned the channels and I have access to sooooo many stations. I haven't even begun to explore my options but am very excited.  I even found out I can program Alexa to tune into this antenna so I just say tune into ABC and proof, I'm watching regular tv.

We recently remodeled and it was going to be a lot of work to move my existing outdoor antenna coax to the new TV location, I had not tried inside antennas for several years after giving up on them a long time ago.....I was hoping that technology had improved.....nope....this does no better than the 4 non-amplified indoor antennas that I had tried and thrown in the garage years ago....pay no attention to the ""milage"" ratings.....unless you are in an elevated location or within 20-25 miles of the transmitter, if you want good performance you need a outside antenna.",3,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0

I did not use the amplifier because I wanted to see if I would get the channels I wanted without the extra cords. I did!

Except for football season (and, we can figure that out, easily), we only watch live tv once per day for the local news.

"Like so many people today, we are searching to find ways to ""cut the cord"" in an effective and economical manner.  We initially tried an inexpensive and small antenna that was rated for up to 35 miles.  Since we only live about ten miles from the transmission towers in our area, we thought we were safe ... but no.  That particular antenna was only able to receive a very few stations out of the many that should be available in our area.Not wanting to give up, we continued to review our options.  That is when we found this antenna, which was listed as a ""Best Seller"" on Amazon.  This particular antenna was rated for 130 miles and included an amplifier.  We were pleasantly surprised at the ease of installation and station detection.  The antenna had no problems at all locating ALL of the stations available in our area.

"I have to say, I had some doubts as to whether this little antenna would be able to pick up much from the first story of our home, but it worked far better than I imagined. The instructions were clear, it took me maybe 10 minutes from unpacking to trying out different windows for the best reception and rescanning. The picture is really clear too! The only thing I would recommend to the manufacturer is to make it with a white cord, to blend in with the baseboards more. For the price and performance you can't go wrong with this antenna.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0

I mounted the antenna to the wall after scanning with a few temporary locations until I was happy with the number of channels and signal, then stuck it to the wall. I am able to get 32 channels with this antenna where I can only get 7 with my attic antenna.

I had to add coax so I could place it in a window facing the Fox tower at around 60 miles. The other networks came in fine.

"This antenna is outperforming the Clear HDTV antenna we purchased from Best Buy.  We were able to simplify tape the antenna to the wall directly behind our Samsung Smart TV easily reaching the input on our TiVO OTA DVR. The antenna is hidden behind the TV, making the installation much less unsightly compared to the Clear which stood on a small end table out in the open. However if you are required to mount it higher on a wall or window, there is ample coax length to reach your antenna input. We’ve tried several different HD antennas but this one is the best by far.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
We recently got rid of our cable. We decided to get an antenna to get our favorite local channels so we can still watch our local tv. This antenna is SO EASY to set up and use. It took 7 minutes to scan channels and the instructions are very clear and easy to understand. It took me less than 12 minutes TOTAL and we had crystal clear local channels. 38 of them and some of them are cable channels! LolWe bought another one for our downstairs tv too. Great product! Easy to install. And VERY affordable. Will recommend to anyone who wants to the cut the cord!,5,1,2020-2-4,1,1,1
I picked up my first HDTV antenna for my girlfriend's TV. I was reallysurprised how well it worked - both in terms of the number of channels,5,1,2020-6-22,1,1,0
"I was a little skeptical about purchasing an antenna for my spare TV. I am cutting the cord on cable. So, I was very surprised that I am able to receive around 20-30 local channels with clear viewable pictures and sound! No sudden lost of picture due to trees, clouds, buildings, storms, snow or interference! I am amazed! Very satisfied with the product and would recommend to anyone. It has a wonderful warranty, as well and it was so simple to setup!!",5,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0
"This is a really seamless and quick way to stream over the air and digital channels when you finally decide to ""cut the cord."" With short and long range settings, this antenna streamlines the process of getting the local and long distance channels to appear. An example is that I live in LA but also can get the local stations in San Diego.I was just hoping to get the basic channels but there are far more channels than I thought.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,1,0
"After a quick and straight forward installation I managed to obtain 37 channels (used the HDTV auto-scan) and some in HD (where available) of Prime Time Networks.  However, you will need to place antenna (with or without the included amplifier) on the window itself to ensure you obtain great signal. Otherwise, you’ll get pixelation due to weak signal indoors.This is perfect for someone who wants prime time and some cable channels WITHOUT needing the bulk of cable channels which you must subscribe for.  This is a one time installation and one time payment.",5,1,2020-4-1,1,1,0
"I gave this 2 stars because some channels are better than none. It picks up about half of the available channels no matter where I place it. I really only wanted the major 4 networks NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox. I can't mount the antenna because I need to move in order to get some channels to work. This product definitely does not reach 80 miles and I don't recommend it if you live further than 30 miles from the signal towers. It might work better for you if you live closer to the network towers. One positive thing I will say is that the antenna itself is very sleek and easy to install. I have to move the location of the antenna almost every time I change the channel. It loses signal very easily too with light rain or someone walking by the antenna. Don't waste your money if you want a long range antenna.",2,1,2020-4-5,1,1,0
"very pleased with quality of product, allows for great reception even from underground/basement areas",5,1,2019-11-17,1,6,0
"Wasn't too sure if this antenna would work and help me cut off my cable company. I installed it on a 2013 Sony WEGA 60"" LED TV and it works amazing. Small with a nice 18 foot long cable lead, easy to program, good reception when placed on my window. I was very impressed at being able to get all my local channels and further ones I never knew existed. 5 Stars and highly recommend this item to cut the cord from your local cable/satellite provider.",5,1,2020-7-29,1,1,0
"I live in an area where TV signals are not very strong between Chicago and Milwaukee.  Tried several different antennas with little success and signal is highly dependent on the weather.  Most neighbors have 40 foot towers to get TV signals, but live in an apartment and cannot do that.  Installed this last night and was amazed at the number of channels and signal strength.  It completely amazes me that something so small can perform so well.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
"The installation was very direct and straightforward, well illustrated, and completely explained.  I did the set up three different times and rescanned for channel signals each time to make sure that I was using the best setup for my particular situation.  We normally use a roof mounted high range digital directional antenna, however we are renovating the room that our television is normally in so we had to move all our equipment to the other side of the house. Because of this and the fact that our neighbor's house is quite close on the side where we have to put the new antenna, our standby antenna did not have enough boost to pick up signals consistently.  Which is why we purchased this product, for its greater range and higher signal power.  So far it seems to work quite well, and we are getting clear signal for the stations that we really care about watching. Good Job!",5,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0
"I live about 8 miles away from a town with around 100,000 residents. I was only able to pick up one tower that is transmitting four channels (main channel plus 3 sub channels)...and it only picks up that tower under perfect weather conditions. There is no good way to test mount the antenna for reception testing prior to peeling the adhesive backing for mounting. If you have to move the antenna after sticking it to the wall, good luck as the adhesive backing will be rendered useless after that. Let's all give a tepid round of applause to our inept government for killing off the tried and true and always functional analog transmission towers for the super state of the art HD digital towers that work great IF you live within 100 feet of the tower.",1,1,2020-2-10,1,2,0
"We live 35 miles west of Boston, and recently cut the cable. No more cable TV for us, but we did miss all the local programing. After doing a little research we purchased the ""U Must Have"" HD TV antenna with amplifier. Our TV did performed a channel scan, and the antenna pulled in 127 TV stations, all of them crystal clear. We highly recommend!",5,1,2019-11-8,1,3,0
"This is a very good antenna I went from 31 channels with my other antenna to 57 channels with this antenna using the included amplifier I have it hanging from my ceiling and I live in a basement that shows that this is a great 👍🏻 antenna in my opinion if it works in the basement which I didn’t think 🤔 it would, I taught that I would have to buy an outside antenna which I didn’t want to. Lightweight good price and can be used in black side or white side to match with your decor. So I’m happy 😊 so far with my purchase.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,1,1
"I bought 4 of these. 3 of the four locations in my home were potentially good spots, the fourth not so good. Three of the four good spots pulled in at least 50 stations, the fourth pulled in 28 stations after only one scan. The antennas were easy to install and I was pleasantly surprised at how well they worked. Between these antennas and my Roku devices, I will be ready to cut the cable cord soon. You have a satisfied customer!",5,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0
I recently hooked up my antenna which took about 2 minutes. It's very simple and easy. I am not getting the channels I expected to however. I still get around 8 channels where I had none before. The picture quality on all is perfect. The antenna is very sensitive. I set it up then lost some channels after tucking the wires behind the TV stand. I would recommend putting the wires where you want them then finding the best place for the antenna itself. Overall I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to a friend.,4,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0
"I moved into a valley. Mountains everywhere. I missed way too many football games last season fooling around with ""top brand"" much more expensive antennas to get stuck in that trap again this season. I could never get all the channels to tune in and no one spot was an ""all clear"" position. Some channels were audio only. Others had cloudy pictures. And others would show in my channel listing but never tune at all. Immediately after finishing a channel scan, this antenna delivered the promised HD clear quality picture and sound on EVERY channel in my channel list. Even picked up channels I didn't even know where available in my area. Before I saw 32 channels. Now there are over 40. And each one tunes. This antenna is amazing especially fit its price. I'll be getting this antenna for all my other rooms with televisions, for sure.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
Got the antenna today via Amazon and I must say I was a bit doubtful atfirst of just how many channels I would get. The install was very easy and,5,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
"I really only purchased this because my dad was worried about me having the news since I don't have cable TV. I use Hulu and Netflix for my show entertainment. So when he suggested me getting a antenna the thought never crossed my mind. I did a quick search and settled in on this product. Great decision! It was easy to install and the channels came in. I get 28 free channels! All reminiscent of my childhood! Some of the picture is a bit shakey and hard to watch, but overall, it gets the job done. Especially in times of crisis and chaos like now (COVID-19).  Thanks.",4,1,2020-4-1,1,1,0
"This is the second HD antenna I purchased and the rated distance is farther. I selected this one because the home I installed it in is a few more miles out of town than the first. The installation was super simple and the picture was nice and crisp. The cool thing was that this antenna picked up stations with it mounted very close to the TV (and almost the center of the home) whereas the first one I purchased has to be on, or, within a few feet of an outer wall.  That's super important because mounting can be potentially very difficult and visually undesirable. Note: All reception will not be the same and is based on the distance from, and physical obstructions to, the TV stations' broadcast signal.",5,1,2019-12-14,1,1,0
"This is the best, I got it hooked up yesterday and scanned for channels and only got a few, but it was a now storm, but at least a local abc channel so I can see/hear the local news. Was SO happy I almost cried and LOVED calling DISH to turn off their TOO EXPENSIVE service. I know there are other channels available, but live in a valley, so just need to find the best position for the antenna. WE CANNOT BELIEVE THE CLARITY OF THE PICTURE ON A OVER 10 YEAR OLD SONY 1080, SO IMPRESSED. And the network channel we do get right now, is one that DISH and the local were fighting about so hadn’t had it for a few months. thank you for this product!",5,1,2020-2-15,1,1,0
We have an older rooftop antenna on our house. With an expensive booster we were able to pick up some local channels.Unfortunately about a year ago that booster went bad and we could only pick up a couple of the closest  stations with bad reception.,5,1,2020-4-25,1,1,0
"Yesterday I received my Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna.  It came packaged very nicely without any damage to speak of.  After opening and unwrapping the contents, it took about 5-10 minutes to set it up, scan for channels and begin watching live television.  To describe this thing in one word......”amazing!”  I am now able to watch 36 local channels and that was without changing the placement or orientation of the antenna.  I will experiment a little with that, because I’m sure that I will be able to pick up more if I move it around a bit.  Thank you so much for a great product.  I will be purchasing another for a family member.- Easy/quick set up",5,1,2020-9-18,1,1,1
I just installed my new HD TV Antenna I purchased from Amazon. Installation was very simple. Had to move the antenna around a couple of times to get all of my local channels but it wasn't a big deal. Finally got in over a hundred channels including ones I never even knew existed.Very pleased and can't wait to brag about it to my friends that are paying way too much for tv through there providers.,5,1,2020-3-23,1,1,0
"We got rid of cable and wanted something to watch local channels (especially when our internet goes out and there is no streaming option for a time!).  We were able to hook up this little antenna quickly and easily and have been receiving the local channels just fine.  Sure enough, 3 days after we installed this antenna, our internet was out for 2 hours and this antenna worked great!  We are very pleased and anticipate many hours of enjoyment due to having this device.  Thanks for a great product!",5,1,2020-9-5,1,1,0
After my antenna was blown off my room I was looking at purchasing and antenna to put in my attic.  I wasn't thrilled at the prospect of crawling around in the attic in the middle of summer.  I came across this indoor antenna and thought with the low price I could afford to give it a change.  Initially I tried the antenna without the amplifier and got a good number of stations.  I was honestly very surprised how many more I got with the amplifier.  I've been using it for a couple months without any complaint.,5,1,2020-7-22,1,1,0
I live 10 miles outside DC and have tons of broadcast towers within 30 miles.  I could only get 4 channels with this particular antenna.  Now I will say that this was for my bedroom where my windows all face away from the city.  It may be that you need a window that clearly faces the towers.  Didnt work either when I put it on the wall that faces city.I do have an antenna input in the attic that isn't powered and that works great hooked up to living room tv.  Was looking for an easier option for bedroom.,2,1,2020-2-8,1,1,0
I was tired of paying for cable TV and not watching any channels except if you were local channels and news. Plus the local cable provider always hiked up the fees. I am a recent cord cutter and  I researched online to see which antenna would  suit my needs. I am impressed by “you must have” antenna. I get approximately 60 channels in the Phoenix metro area. Now I’m never paying for cable TV. Thank you very muchPros:,5,1,2020-1-6,1,1,0
"I won a 10 cent bet with my husband that it would work fine in the basement. Just had to put antenna near a window.  Now I need to set one upstairs in the living room, the great deal of getting a second one is highly unusual in today’s business world. ‘‘This  company makes  a great product and has the confidence to sell it at a great price!  Be sure you try different locations to get the best reception. Try it without the amplifier, then add the amplifier before moving it.  Good luck and enjoy much more economical tv viewing!",5,1,2020-1-17,1,1,0
"Order ID#114-602-6133-5271467 one day delivery with prime.Antenna packaged very well no missing components, installation straight forward.  Plan to spend a little time finding the right mounting location and scanning for channels. On my first scan I got 35 channels and on my final position and scan I received 44 channels.  The high definition is very good. Have  some minor pixelation but not on channels I would tune to anyway.  This antenna has gotten me one step closer to cutting the cable, glad I made the purchase.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,2,1
"This antenna works as advertised. To be honest , I did not have high hopes. I felt like it was too good to be true and that I would only get a handful of channels. The antenna picked up 46 digital channels and a few analog.  The picture quality is crystal clear. I am currently watching the 2020 superbowl with zero issues. I am totally satisfied with this product so far.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,2,1
I live about 30 miles from tower in the suburbs. Ive tried short and long range and moving the antenna to multiple spots on a large window that faces a wide open sky directly to the tower. I scan and receive maybe 8 spanish channels but they dont even work properly. Ive tried getting help through their 800 number but no oje callw back. I tried email and they just copy and paste instructions.  They said someone would call me to help. No calls in 2 days.,1,1,2020-9-18,1,1,0
"Simple setup. What I appreciate is the signal booster. I dont know if it helps, but having the window facing condos, it may help with getting a signal.What stinks is not able to get the vhf channels and that could be a number of factors, but the antenna itself isnt the problem.",5,1,2020-7-30,1,1,1
"This is a very good antenna so far.  I was able to get 60+ channels.  Very easy to set up.  I selected the long range option to get the most channels, and I moved my antenna a few times before I found a place that worked best.  Tip - keep moving your antenna around and even flip it to see what works best for maximum channels.  I was stuck at 20 for awhile until I found a spot right under my window sill.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,2,0
I bought this antenna as a stopgap to get some off the air TV reception until next summer when I intended to put up a TV tower.  I live in a valley surrounded by trees.  I have a 64 inch plasma HDTV in my finished basement (underground) to make matters worse.  The city broadcasting is a little over 20 miles away.  I connected the coax for antenna to the TV and then placed the antenna itself vertically under the ceiling tile (from a dropped ceiling).  I got ABC and Fox immediately and crystal clear.  Turning the antenna allowed me to receive other CBS and NBC.  It was as simple as that.  I am very pleased with my purchase.,5,1,2019-11-25,1,1,0
"Changed my review after 3 months.. It works fine sometimes, but most of the time I was always having to reposition it some where, and if I held my mouth right it worked as long as I stood on my left foot.I still have it and I ordered a higher price one that hooks up out side,  It works almost perfect . you should consider paying more in your purchase....4/5/20 update I took it outside to my man barn and hooked it up and it works fine out there so far, so it a signal reception issue depending on your placement.",3,1,2020-1-29,1,1,0
"It took me about 5 minutes to hook it up and scan for channels. I went from 12-13 channels with rabbit ears to 45 channels!!!.  You can barely see it from outside.  My one suggestion for installation is to tape it to the window with a piece of removable tape, then do autoscan on your TV. I did have to move mine over a bit because the metal stairs were in the way.  After you find the right spot, use the 3M double-sided tape included.",5,1,2020-7-23,1,1,1
"I have been terrified to cut the cord with cable and I finally got upset last week and decided to order your antenna. I received it on Sunday but I was hesitant to do anything with it. Finally, I called my cable company and told them to cancel my cable subscription. Twenty minutes later, my cable is gone and I put up the antenna. I admit I was worried it wouldn't pick up anything because we are in a weird spot on the fourth floor of an apartment building where service is not consistent. However, we managed to get 49 channels! We are so pleased with the antenna! I am shocked at the clarity of the channels, too!",5,1,2020-2-4,1,1,0
"waste of money. does not get local channels like ABC, NBC, CBS. I thought this would allow me to watch NFL on sundays but it only gives you BS channels like ""watch kids play fortnite"" and streaming video garbage channels.",1,1,2020-2-24,1,3,0
REVISED UPDATE: this is now the second Antenna I bought. This was for a family member in a different state. They LOVE IT! Ultra HD picture clarity AND saves money when you dont need cable.... once again - great buy!............I'm really impressed! The picture quality is amazing! Full HD... I was nervous it wouldn't work because I live high up in an apartment building with somewhat poor reception - NOPE... did not affect the antenna one bit. I highly recommend it!!!,5,1,2020-4-6,1,1,0
"I purchased this for a backup where I live and work. I live in a coastal City, and with hurricane season here, I wanted something in case we lose cable and or internet for local stations. I installed this last weekend, very easy, no directions needed. Scanned, and it found 6 channels, I worked with it for about 10 minutes or so, and finally found the best location, which found 11 channels, but please note that I live in an apartment and the walls are all concrete, and fire walls, and I often struggle to get cell signal inside, so this is great! Wonderful picture, crisp and clear. Only 1 channel that freezes and that is a PBS station that we do not watch. Wonderful and cost effective antenna!",5,1,2020-6-18,1,1,0
"I’ve  seen several of these and even tried a couple. Thought I would try one more  time and this time, it worked fine, although the company doesn't quite get it. After installation, I am receiving all of the local channels. The broadcast distance is only about 20 miles. After a few tries, I discovered that leaving the wire fully extended makes it work best because it becomes part of the receiver. It is not co-axial cable. An earlier version failed  and that seems to be why. The instructions don’t mention this in the Chinglish used to explain the set-up. No cable management here. String it all out!",4,1,2020-2-15,1,1,0
I got this antenna to replace my existing indoor antenna which was rated for 50+ miles with a signal booster.  I can say that this new antenna is more sensitive and/or the booster is better than my old antenna.The following test was done in my two story house on a clear weather day.,5,1,2020-9-22,1,1,0
"I abandond cable TV when I realized I was paying $48/mo. for the basic package (as a new subscriber it would be even more) for something I never watched.  Most of the channels were worthless or of no interest to me.  The only thing I missed was the major network channels, e.g. Sunday night football on NBC.  Then I heard about digital TV.  I bought the Gesobyte Digital Antenna with some trepidation: I'm not very good when it comes to hooking up technical things.  However, all I had to do was plug in a cord into my TV and it worked.  The first channel I got was NBC, and the HDTV was far better than what you see on cable.  I watched the first game at the new SoFi Stadium last night, and I wouldn't have been able to get that channel without the digital antenna. I am delighted with this and am telling all my friends about it.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
"OK, so I tried an antenna years ago and had terrible reception so I was not optimistic.  But, we switched to streaming only from cable and wanted to get local channels in case we ever needed local news.  To my shock, we get over 30 channels and all of the local ones look great so I am thrilled.  Will add another one upstairs, and I will recommend since everyone is asking me for advice now on streaming. It doesn't show in the photos but one side of the antenna is white, so it is camouflaged on my white wall.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,1,1
I have bought two of these. I bought the first one about 5 months ago for my RV. I took it to my daughters house in the country and hooked it up because the didn’t have cable. It worked so well my son-in-law bought one for his trailer and my daughter kept the other. I just bought another to replace the one my daughter kept. I do a lot of off the grid camping in my RV and this gets channels when others can’t!,5,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0
"G’bye $200 monthly cable bills!! We  easily installed this item- found the best wall for reception after moving it around- it sets itself up- we found MANY GREAT  channels- couldn’t be happier- of course we’re still paying for internet but the cable package monthly bills are GONE FOREVER! We’re never going back to cable- our smart tv gives us many options; we are subscribers to Amazon, Netflix & Hulu too. We highly recommend this tv “antenna “ to everyone! We brought back one we bought at Home Depot- this one is much better!",5,1,2019-12-22,1,1,0
"My HD TV Antenna with amplified signal booster is working exceptionally well. Even though the TV is mounted on a wall in the middle of the house and the antenna is placed near the floor on that wall, the channels still connect and the picture is stable and clear.I have this connected to a 4k Roku TV, and the built in Roku had no problem utilizing the antenna’s signal. It pulls in more channels (33!) than my other HD TV antenna (older model, different brand) that is mounted on an exterior wall and doesn’t have a signal booster. The instructions were way more than I expected for a device that is essentially so user friendly you can just plug-n-play.",5,1,2020-6-12,1,1,0
"I purchased the antenna for local channels since I don't have a cable subscription but still wanted access to local news. It arrived quickly and was packaged well. Setup and install was easy but finding the perfect location to get the most channels was tricky. If I just put it up and left it as was I had about 12 channels right away, but I wanted additional stations so I played with the location to find the sweet spot and ended up with 26 channels. It works great and weather doesn't seem to impact the signal either. The only thing is the glue dots that come with it are great for the initial install but once removed can't be reused and leave a residue that is difficult to remove. So I would suggest put it and leave it or if you think you might want to move it then use clear tape instead. Overall a great product and I would recommend it.",4,1,2020-6-27,1,1,0
"I have to say I wasn't sure how this antenna was going to perform. But after hooking it up I was amazed. My son and I first hooked it up in our backyard on a pole just temporarily to see if we could get CBS network for the LSU Bama game this Saturday. I have cable with all the channels but I was just looking for something portable with a flat screen outside under the patio as I haven't yet installed a cable outside with a permanent TV installation. We are about 40 miles north of New Orleans by way of the crow flies. Being in the backyard and pointing the antenna South, even though it was on a pole, we will pretty much point in it at the roof of my house. To my surprise, we picked up 17 channels. So then I told my son let's set the antenna on side of the house pointing South to get a clear a path. Wow! We actually picked up 40 channels including a perfect HD CBS channel.",5,1,2019-11-4,1,2,0
It didn't improve the reception at all or increase the number of stations.  Practically every station I want to access cuts out or quits receiving altogether.  I exchanged it for my previous antenna because it touted that you can receive from over 100 miles and it is worse than the one I removed.  We live in the Twin Cities.,1,1,2020-2-10,1,2,0
"We replaced one of our older OTA Amplified TV Antennas with this on, and the difference is night and day!  When a townhome was built next door, blocking our ""view"" of the mountain top with the TV transmitters, we lost most of our OTA reception ability, despite considerable efforts to relocate the antenna.  I saw this one and gave it a try.  Amazing!  We now have over 40 OTA signals, all digital, and all truly great quality viewing.  I would, and will, buy this product again!",5,1,2020-6-13,1,1,0
"I have purchased two of these HD antennas from Amazon.  We live in the rural south and our bigger metropolitan area is about 60 miles northwest.  We had an outdoor antenna which was able to pick up all the major local TV stations.  However, our outdoor antenna got knocked over by a tree recently and I just did not feel like rewiring another outdoor antenna back into the house.  So, my wife asked about indoor antennas.  At first, I was skeptical as I am used to ""rabbit ears"" and am not familiar with your flat design.  To our surprise, we got very good reception.  We were able to get a total about 15 channels which was slightly less than our outdoor antenna.  The picture quality is great - about as good if not better than our old antenna.  I would definitely recommend the HD antenna not only for the reception but ease of installation.  We just placed the antenna on the wall.I cannot wait to get another antenna so that I can put a TV in my study.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,1,0
"We recently made the decision to go from a  cable tv subscriber to an internet only household but found ourselves lacking the local news during this pandemic which made us nervous. My father suggested we purchase an antenna to obtain the channels within our area. Honestly, I never knew this was an option anymore. We received our antenna and had it set up in less than ten minutes and had way more channels than we initially thought was possible. The clarity of the picture is perfect and exactly what we needed. I have already told at least 6 families how great this is and sent them the link to purchase it themselves.",5,1,2020-4-4,1,1,0
"After getting super annoyed with the only cable company that supports our semi-rural home, we decided to cancel it. It wasn't really a problem until football season started to roll around the only place we could stream primetime football was on our little phones on the Yahoo app. My dad started talking about how at his work place, they don't have cable and watch football with an antenna! After looking at Walmart, I found this flat and small one on Amazon and we set it up downstairs!The picture quality is AMAZING! As clear as watching from our Playstation! So happy and so ready for football Sundays!",5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"I will compare this to my previous antenna which is 5 years old and lost 8 channels, 2 of which I need for sports. I am about 28 miles from our transmitting towers and just like my old antenna when it was new, I could not get a complete channel reception by mounting inside. Mounted behind TV and by window using the long range setting I was missing NBC and Telemundo. Could be to the fact that my home is block and dual pane windows or maybe just palm trees and structures in between. Anyways I moved the new antenna into the attic where the old antenna resides now and using the long range amplifier I was able to receive all available channels. Although I had to do a little of work to achieve receiving the complete channels available in my area I am very satisfied with the antenna, especially compared to my old one that was located in the same spot and would not receive 8 channels.

"I recently moved from the central part of my town to another (south of a mountain range), and discovered that the non-amplified HDTV antenna that worked at the old address was no longer good enough. Based on customer ratings, I ordered the amplified U Must Have Digital HDTV Antenna a week or two ago.As expected, assembly is simple – merely screwing in connectors and plugging into a USB port on my television. The antenna is nice and flat, and I easily hid it behind the mounting bracket for the TV. One nice touch is that the antenna is black on one side and white on the other, giving better choices for making it inconspicuous.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,1,0
"This HDTV antenna could not have been easier to install.  Simply plug it into the powered USB on the TV panel, and onto the RF antenna post and begin scanning for channels.  The adhesives make it easy to attach to the back of the TV, or to the wall behind the TV.  It took only 5 min to set up!",5,1,2020-5-17,1,2,0
"I cut our cable about a year ago.. we also cut down expenses with these online streaming services..however, if I had known about this product a year ago, I would have boughten it then. I live around bunch of hills (Santa Clarita) and I was already assuming there is no way I’m getting any reception with any antenna!! But wait, I purchased this antenna and after moving it all around my living room, I actually was able to get 50 free channels, 2,4,5,7,9 Spanish Channels and Asian channels. I was so surprised!! I would however buy extra self adhesive stickers, just in case ..",5,1,2020-2-7,1,1,0
I just received my new HDTV antenna through Amazon and I was really hoping for the best. My last antenna I purchased from Walmart and it barely got channels. This antenna was to be used in my kids rooms to get Channel 10.3 PBS Kids. I was hoping that it would give them that channel clear with no static and it DID. I am so happy about this purchase. Normally when I scanned channels with the Walmart antenna I would only get 30 - 40 static channels. But with this antenna i was able to get 65 channels. I am so pleased with this purchase and intend to buy more for my living room and bedroom. This was super easy to install. & I hung it in my window the antenna came with little sticky pads and it is very thin,5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
I bought the HDTV Antenna for my mom because she was having trouble watching her Spanish speaking channels on our local airwaves. We were using an old antenna from the early 2000’s or possibly from the late 90’s to watch our local tv channels on an 60in tv. Sometimes the signal strength wasn’t enough for some of the Spanish speaking channels to display properly which cause my mom to miss her favorite Spanish Soaps.After we bought the HDTV antenna with amplifier and installed following easy setup guide. The signal strength improved was much improved and even displayed her favorite Spanish speaking channels without any loss of signal.,5,1,2020-8-2,1,1,0
I placed the antenna in a basement window.  I tried this antenna on a late model sony tv and went through normal tv antenna channel discovery.  It resulted in finding only a few digital channels.I then tried a initial setup of the tv and antenna from the setup menu.  The tv discovered over 40 digital channels with outstanding clarity.  We had to select wide to get the best HD picture.  This antenna was a wonderful acquisition and I rate it 5 stars,5,1,2020-9-2,1,1,0
"We had some older digital antennas that we recently tried but the quality was not there on the signal.  We decided to see if new technology in digital antenna had improved.  Our new HDTV antenna arrived yesterday as ordered thru Amazon.  It was AMAZING.  Within 15 minutes of unpacking the antenna and letting our HDTV discover all of the channels, we were watching TV in brilliant HD quality for all the local channels.  No in and out signal but clear and consistent.  I am a believer !",5,1,2020-1-23,1,1,0
"Want to save over $1500 a year? You need to get yourself one of these. I believe almost anyone can install one. After Comcast raised the bill again I had enough so it was time to look for a different way to watch TV. Taking a chance I ordered one of these. What a surprise when it was hooked up and turned the set on. Crystal clear picture, 40 + channels in an area where I don't even get cell service. Great product, buy one and save yourself a ton of money and ENJOY IT !!!",5,1,2020-2-9,1,1,0
"Just got my new antenna (purchased on Amazon) and hooked it up to my Samsung TV.Super easy to install...great directions, simple to install and very well made. Hooked it up, set TV source to ""antenna"" and scanned channels. It located over 60 channels, some I never heard of !",5,1,2020-8-17,1,1,0
"Before buying this Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna I was only able to see 4 channels on my TV.  After installing this antenna, and scanning for new channels, I now have 120 channels.  Wow, I couldn't believe it!  I placed the antenna by a window near the TV.  It's very light and it doesn't take any space at all.  The installation is so easy, and I believe it will last for years.  I strongly recommend it!",5,1,2020-7-11,1,1,0
It was like magic. In just seconds I was able to see 34 HD TV Channels that I previously able to view none of. In less than 1 month it will pay for itself since it enables me to cancel the Streaming cost for a lot of these channels that I had to pay a monthly fee for.I was able to get all of these Channels from the window (backside of my curtains) beside my downstairs TV in Colorado Springs with lots of mountains.,5,1,2020-9-13,1,1,0
"We were previously using rabbit ears style antenna, and kept having the signal distort, drop, and lost channels even with clear weather (probably the wind blowing trees or something).I installed this new HDTV antenna and now get 56 channels, up from the 30 we were getting, plus we get the channels we actually want: PBS, Fox, ABC, MeTV.",5,1,2020-5-25,1,1,0
"I've been trying different antennas for our lower level room TV on and off for years.  This one shocked me because it worked incredibly well by comparison....and I did not have to fiddle around aiming it.  Its performance is good 24/7, not just at some parts of the day.  The price was very fair too.And I appreciate it not having rabbit ears to catch on items in the room and break off!!",5,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0
"I purchased this antenna, for my bedroom, my tv comes in crystal clear without having to move the antenna all around, love that it comes with little stickers to put the antenna anywhere and will not come off them and I would diffidently purchase this again, Very pleased with it,",5,1,2019-11-4,1,4,0
The antenna works very good.  It took a little trial and error to figure out where to hang it in my house but I now get all the local channels in my area.  The channels come in nice and clear some of them better than when I had cable.  I believe I get about 36 channels I was able to pick up 45 in one area but it didn't get fox 53 so I moved it to be able to get that channel instead of some of the others.  For the price and ease of use it is definitely worth it. It helps save me money and my husband is happy because he didn't want to deal with hooking up an outdoor antenna!,5,1,2020-3-30,1,1,0
This antenna is a game-changer literally. Before having this I tried several different antennas to try and pull in our local station that has our local MLS Soccer games. I could never get it to come in clear regularly. After installing this antenna not only do I get this channel with a great signal but I am also pulling in almost 20 additional channels that I did not get previously.,5,1,2020-9-1,1,1,0
"When FOX pulled their broadcasting from DISH prior to the NFL playoffs and Super bowl we were unable to view them and still unable to view any FOX programs on DISH.So we watched it for FREE!!!, because we purchased the HDTV Antenna and received a perfect picture and was able to view FOX and many other channels and are still able to view them. This has made us VERY HAPPY!!!",5,1,2020-3-17,1,1,0
"We have recently moved to a new area of the country and wanted to try our luck with antenna tv. Being about an hour outside of a large city, we went to the store and bought the antenna with the best reviews and longest distance. It was challenging to put together, and even then we had to play with the angle multiple times and were finally able to get a handful of channels. Slightly discouraged, we were hesitant to try anything else, but decided to take a chance on one more antenna just to have some comparison. We purchased the Ultra-Thin HDTV Antenna. It was so easy to install and there were no angles to play with. When we searched for channels, it found 59! We couldn’t believe it. Not only were there so many channels, they were also coming in crystal clear. We strongly recommend this antenna as it was easy to install and really works!",5,1,2020-4-18,1,1,0
"The channels are the UHF channels available with any good quality HDTV antenna. This one does offer a higher quality than most.  I was surprised to find additional sub channels for stations I had assumed never had any.  The use of the sticky pads allows me to adhere the antenna to the window and the long cable makes it possible for me to use it from a location not requiring me to keep the TV close to the window. I'm using the USB power source required,and I'm doing so from the computer, although they provide a power outlet plug also.The 2nd unit is an extra bonus",5,1,2020-5-4,1,1,0
"I bought the Digital HDTV Antenna (LPN PM 14061) as a replacement for my getting-more-expensive-by-the-month cable provider. Using the easy-to-follow instructions, I found the ultra-thin flat antenna to be extremely easy to attach to a nearby window & the cable was long enough to connect my TV without any difficulty. After connecting the provided external power adapter, channel scanning with the TV native remote was pretty quick & easy (Google over-the-air digital channels in your area or simply go to fcc.gov/media/engineering/dtvmaps), and I was pleasantly surprised at the number of digital channels found by the antenna & pleased to see that a number of channels found were those I had with my cable provider! Finally, the quality of the programs displayed for practically all the channels found was much better & sharper than I expected!",5,1,2020-5-28,1,1,0
"We just purchased the amplified HD digital tv antenna.  It arrived in only one day.  It took less time to set up the antenna than it did to figure out how to scan for channels on the tv itself.  We had tried an indoor antenna years ago and due to our location were not able to get any reception.  With your antenna we are able to access 13 channels that come in as clear as cable.  After recently cutting the cable cord, we were thrilled especially considering the price.  We would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to cut the cord!",5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
"There is nothing to dislike and everything to love, from the well packaged and illustrated contents to the ease of assembly.  Plenty of cable and cord length without the need of extensions.  After rescanning for available channels I picked up 30% more and with sharper imaging than with my unamplified previous antenna.  There was also no picture breakup on channels where there had been before.  I would give this antenna more than 5 stars if I could.",5,1,2020-4-28,1,1,0
"Nothing to really assemble, just plug it into the cable connection on the TV and run a scan channels program from the remote.We live ten miles north of Tucson, unobstructed by tall buildings or mountains and we are only able to pick up three stations, not the most popular ones at that.",1,1,2020-5-9,1,1,0
"I received the gesobyte antenna today and went right to hooking it up.  It is incredibly easy to hook up. All you need to do is screw in thecoaxial cable and plug in the power cord and you're off and running in less than 5 minutes.  As far as the quality goes I am very impressed with the resolution of this antenna on my 4k Samsung smart TV.  It is very sharp and the colors are great, I watched some nhl hockey and some college football",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"Works great, lightweight, easy to hook up, I got 50 channels, but most importantly I got all the big networks. There is also a lot of good content on some of the other local broadcasts and then there are a lot that I will be deleting but overall there is more free over the air content than expected, I'm going to try one in my RV to see what happens. I couldnt get to a window so I put it on the wall above my TV and got 2big networks in 1080i and 1 in 720i which still looks good",5,1,2020-2-14,1,1,0
"Super easy to set up and adjust to get even more channels. At first I hooked it up without the extra signal strengthener and got many more channels without even searching; they were just there but channel 12 didn't come in so I hooked up the signal strengthener and put it up on the wall right behind the TV (because I don't want to see it) and got twice as many channels when I went into the TV and did the auto tune. Great product, great results.",5,1,2020-4-21,1,1,0
"Overall this product is great. Within a few minutes installed, and depending on the antenna location we were picking up 19 to 40+ channels. A couple words of caution, we had a lot of electrical equipment (tv, sound bar, hdmi switch, blu-ray player and roku). When re-connecting all these devices the electrical interference dropped channels. Do plan to set up the antenna several feet away if you have many electrical devices and don't allow the antenna in ditect contact with metal. Our antenna is maybe 10-15 feet away from the TV and we are still picking up 29 channels.  Secondly, the switch between short/long range is ~1 1/4"" wide and there is no quick disconnect between the antenna and the switch.  Therefore if going through a wall to mount, the hole has to be ~1 1/2"" in diameter to route everything. Otherwise love it!",5,1,2020-8-16,1,1,0
"I purchased an Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna the other day because I finally got rid of cable television.  I wanted an antenna to get the local channels to watch college football when (if) it starts back this year.I was a little hesitant and didn't know what to expect but the technology has come a long way from the rabbit ears of old.  There was some moving around of the antenna to get the best signal and number of channels but I have to say I was very impressed with how wonderful it works.  The channels came in HD on a 75"" TV and just as good as Comcast.  I am a fan and will be keeping it around.  I am now saving $90 a month by getting rid of cable.  I was able to get a total of 43 channels off the antenna.",5,1,2020-5-12,1,1,0
"Awesome antenna! First of all... I live in the country and only get 5 channels on the 40 ft. Tower antenna. I put a TV in my shop and I was looking for a good antenna, I didn't want to pull cable from there.. I tried 2 other brands and could only get 3 stations. Then i ordered this one and WOW!  It's awesome,  now I receive 12 channels, some from a 100 miles away. Crystal clear picture!",5,1,2020-9-24,1,1,1
"This product did not work for me. I tried it a dozen times and even contacted Sony for assistance. USB was tried in both the TV USB outlet as well as wall plugin. The amp was receiving power both ways, but simply couldn’t find any channels. I’m only 15 miles from Seattle and didn’t find a single channel. I was really hoping this would work, but will need to unfortunately return this product.",1,1,2020-2-28,1,2,0
"Clear HD picture once set up.  This device was easy to setup.  Keep in mind: if your tv does not have a USB connection, then you need to plug the amplifier into the wall.  I set up the antenna on an interior wall with TV stations in Green Bay WI approximately 40 miles away.  I suspect there is some HVAC (metal) in the wall affecting the signal, but I was able to find a spot where the signal comes in.  I get all the basic OTA channels.  HD quality.  There are TV stations 80 miles away in Wausau, WI.  These stations do not come in through the antenna.  I live on a hill, not a valley.  I highly doubt this antenna would reach 120 miles, especially inside a house.  My thoughts: excellent antenna.  Works good for my needs (basic TV/HD quality).  However, I suspect it works best within 30 miles of towers.  Antennas beyond 45 miles will be very difficult to pick up.",4,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
"The Antenna came promptly, well packaged, included nice instruction with pictures, good quality paper. The installation was very easy for a person like myself with average tech 'digital' skill! I have been using only for last few hours but the picture quality and availability of many channels is definitely right antenna for me. The customer reviews and the seller's answers made a big difference in making mu decision. I may provide additional comments later on if warranted after extended experience.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,1,0
"This was my first time looking at antenna's, I didn't want to spend over $40 on one because I didn't want to waste money on something that may not work. After reviewing products at local stores and I decided to come to Amazon. And this was the first product that popped up for me. I was hesitant on buying it, but now that I have it, I love it. Definitely recommend this product, it's easy to hook up, easy to operate and I love the interface that it has. Definitely a 10/10!",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
"I went to Walmart, bought what I thought was a nice antenna, and haven’t been able to watch my tv since I dropped cable. I was starting to regret this choice. But I saw the reviews for this hdtv antenna, and the reasonable cost, and thought I would give it a try.... all I can say is WOW. My husband casually set it in a chair next to the tv while setting it up, and it got such a clear signal. This was before we even mounted it on the wall. Personally we didn’t end up with any more channels then before, but that’s not a problem. Literally the only thing we cared about was being able to watch the local channels we had without it cutting out. If you’re wondering if you should buy this antenna, yes, buy it.",5,1,2020-5-6,1,1,0
"Despite fearing the worst in terms of setup, the antenna proved as easy to set up as advertised. I was particularly concerned I’d need an additional cable to attach it to my new Recast DVR, but none was needed! Tough extremely light, one may need a few more double sided stick-Ins depending on the surface. Overall, extremely satisfied with ease of use, included cords, quality & number of stations, and the price for the extended warranty.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,1,1
"My husband and I recently cut the ""cable cord"" from Xfinity/comcast and we are very happy that we did. Now, we have AT&T internet.  We were looking for affordable streaming service that offers local channels for less than $30.00 per month. We tried Sling, however,  my husband is a huge sports fan and Sling doesn't include your local channels like CBS, Fox, and local news. Here is where the antenna comes into play. We ordered this antenna after watching a YouTube channel regarding antennas. We are thrilled about the HDTV quality and the amount of channels, originally we only received 7 channels, but after mounting the antenna on the wall. We were able to receive 18 channels.  We are able to receive all of the good free channels like, CBS, Fox,ABC, court tv, me tv, H&I, get tv, decades, Dabl, start tv, and many more. Easy to follow instructions, set up took me less than 5 mins.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,1,1
"We are amazed at the picture quality with this little gem. It took us about 45 minutes to figure out how to set up our Samsung smart TV, but that's not the Antenna's fault. We were concerned because our TV is on the north side of the house and all the close towers are to the south, but no worries! The antenna is on the north side next to the TV, not in a window, and it pulled in 42 channels. Wow!",5,1,2020-9-1,1,1,0
I gave this antenna a negative review but after hearing from the manufacturer and making adjustments to its location the reception is much better.  The image is clearer and I don't have to reset the channels as before.  It's important that you learn where the towers are so you can place the antenna in the correct location.  You can find the locations on line.,4,1,2019-12-23,1,2,0
"This is my first time using this antenna. I'm very pleased on how easy it was to set up. The packaging was super impressive. I was shocked at how quickly I was able to get channels the moment I connected the antenna to the tv.My only negative was the stickers that came with it...they do not adhere to the wall very long, I just used a command strip and all is well.",5,1,2020-3-24,1,2,0
"I do not ever write reviews nor do I really take them seriously.  In my quest to ""cut the cord"" with cable, I just wanted something to get local channels free.  This antenna was really my guinea pig test and it passed with flying colors!!!  The reviews said how easy it was to set up and the clear HD pictures was exactly what I was looking for.  The instructions were so easy and literally took minutes to set up.  It has a beautiful picture and you can't tell if you are watching cable or antenna.  I didn't know there were so many free channels out there!!!  I will be buying a couple more of these for my other TVs.Thanks for putting out a great product!!!  I am recommending this to friends and family.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0
Just thought I’d send a note on the excellent reception I now receive on my TV since installing the antenna. I’m now receiving 54 stations. I did what your install instructions recommended and have 9 more stations using the amplifier than without it. The antenna works well positioned at the top corner of a window. It will be so useful now if we have tornadoes or other bad weather to be able to see and hear the newscast near the safe zone in our home.,5,1,2020-5-15,1,1,0
"I bought one of these antennas through Amazon and I absolutely love it. It took me longer to move the TV out from the wall than it took me to install the antenna. Picture quality is  at least as good as cable, maybe even better. I bought this is the first step to cutting the cable, and I wish I would’ve done it 10 years ago. I get more local coverage with this than I did with cable. One additional advantage that I found is that I get to use the native TV remote instead of the cable remote. This gives me more options than the cable remote did. After installing this I’m definitely going through with the cable cutting. I should save close to $1200 a year by doing this.  I’m having a few issues with pixelation but Support has largely fixed the issue. I suspect we’re getting some interference from outside.  Support from the sellers has been outstanding. Emails immediately responded to with about 4 emails swapped within an hour of my first email.",5,1,2020-2-24,1,1,0
"I purchased your Amplified HD Digital TV antenna approximately 4 weeks ago after cancelling my cable subscription. I am very pleased with the quality of your product, the reception is outstanding.

"A week ago I purchased and attached the Ultra Thin HDTV Antenna.  I had been using rabbit ears with limited success as it received most, but not all, the major networks even though I live in a metro area.After attaching the Ultra Thin HDTV Antenna and running the auto program tv setting I was amazed at all the channels I received. I went from receiving 27 digital channels to receiving 45 digital and 1 analog channel.  All clear, even the ABC network the rabbit ears could never receive.  Additionally, all channels were received without need to use the amplifier provided with the antenna.",5,1,2020-2-19,1,1,0
This antenna is perfect.  Very lightweight and powerful. The Antenna has been amazing so far and I am able to pick up 12 channels compared to the 3 that I was getting with my old antenna.  I also noticed that the strength od the channels is much higher.  My TV shows the strength of the signal when first change the channel and it’s ready 65 - 100 percent. On my old Antenna I would be lucky to get 50 percent.  so happy with this purchase.,5,1,2020-9-7,1,1,0
"I almost cut the cord last year but Direct TV gave me such a good deal, that I stayed around another year. However, that deal is up and I cannot afford to keep paying $80-100/month for TV.  I mainly watch the local channels and then watch movies through streaming services - so I finally decided to cut the cord. Before I did so I ordered several antennas from Amazon to try them out to make sure I could get local channels. I settled on this Digital HDTV Antenna because it brings in a great picture and the channels I need - and now no fees. Setup was easy as long as you know how to access the setup on your tv to search for channels. Pretty easy to find under the Menu of any TV remote.  The antenna has a nice long cord which I really appreciate- it allowed me to move it around to various sides of the room to determine where the best location would be for the most channels. The antenna is flat, white on one side, black on the other and very unobtrusive.  I'm looking forward to the money I'm saving in the next year!",5,1,2020-3-15,1,1,0
"Finally a great antenna! I’ve bought so many other antennas in the last 5 years through different living locations and this is by far the best antenna. I actually get every single channel clearly with no glitching and no having to move the antenna around to get certain channels better. And no having to go to a different room to get certain channels.It has a long enough cable so you can move it all over the place to find the best spot - as you can see in the pic I have it way up in the corner and the cord is actually draping down below the window not across. It’s very lightweight and thin, and it comes with a few sticky pads to stick the antenna where you want it (but all you need is one).",5,1,2020-9-7,1,1,1
"We purchased this antenna to watch the Super Bowl...since our DISH and FOX are having issues...the antenna was so very easy to install..and to tell you the truth we thought the picture was much better then the satellite.  Also, since it is just one small thin unit with no rabbit ear antenna attached it is very pleasing to the eye and so simple to just set it on the window sill...thank you for making a quality product.Mary and Lawrence Bryan",5,1,2020-2-8,1,1,0
"I was pleasantly surprised with how well this works. I was skeptical that it would give me a clear picture or that I would even receive more than one or 2 channels.I have 2 TV's that need to be hooked up, but I only bought one Antenna in case I couldn't get any reception.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,1
"The package arrived before expected which is always nice. Setup was incredibly easy with just a few coaxial cables to connect and just plug it in for power! Make sure to test out different places for the best reception before you finally mount the antenna. The reception was great initially but when I attached the power to it... WOW, it was amazing got a ton of channels. Another tip is to try rescanning if not all the channels come in. We placed ours high up on the living room window. Very discrete. The antennae itself is very lightweight. It's an HD quality picture and I'm not kidding the local channels look even better than they did when we had cable. This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. I am very pleased and would highly recommend this to anyone looking to cut the cord on expensive cable bills.",5,1,2020-5-12,1,1,0
"This perfectly replaced my rabbit ear style HD antenna. What I like most is the physical design. It’s as flat as a report cover, and about the same dimensions (like a sheet of paper.)It set up easily on my window pane and the wire was generously long, possibly 12 feet. That’s an estimate, I didn’t measure.",5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"I just installed an antenna.  I have not had cable for over 12 years, as I have refused to pay the terrible cable prices.  Instead, I have opted for for Netflix and Amazon, but never had local channels, and would always get my news from the internet.  I didn’t realize that I would be able to obtain local channels but simply using this antenna!Using the easy directions, I was able to hook it up immediately, and had 22 channels!",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"The instruction manual was very detailed,easy to follow for connecting the antenna to the tv,scanning for local channels and how to place antenna in room for best reception. Also I like there are 3 mounting tabs for placing antenna on a wall. The antenna is light and pliable so it’s easy to adhere and stay on wall.I scanned for local channels after set up and was quite surprised and delighted to get 51 local channels,way more than I expected to get.",5,1,2020-9-1,1,1,1
"I ordered off of Amazon and it arrived through Prime Shipping 2 days later. Installation was very easy. I am glad that the USB power could work off of my TV's USB plug in. The antenna has both short and long range. This is very helpful. Setup was a breeze and after just 10 minutes of my TV scanning for channels, I now have 22 different channels! Great product and very easy to install!",5,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0
"Wow, what a great antenna! Super easy to install took 2 minutes. We had a previous antenna by another manufacturer I wasn’t pleased with it so I started researching and found this one. What a HUGE difference. The picture quality is great and we get so many more channels. The antenna is thin and lightweight. I would HIGHLY recommend!",5,1,2020-5-17,1,2,1
We have had very good reception using this particular product with our television and just wanted everyone to know how easy it was to install and use once you determine where to put it in location.  This unit is being used in our spare bedroom for when we have company.  Our first purchase was put in our basement for a gym room television.  Both are perfect for the use and convenience needed to add additional channels for free!  Love the product!!,5,1,2020-5-17,1,1,0
"I received the HDTV antenna yesterday, and after the very easy installation, have been watching the numerous channels that were located during set up. Some are favorites that I have not been able to watch for years since switching to only streaming channels. Also, I like watching the news on my television and receive most local news channels. I am very satisfied with my purchase.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,1
"After being a loyal customer of streaming tv for what seemed like mostly just local channel's, and with the lineup changes and price increases my viewing time decreased. I decided to get rid of the streaming service, however with that came a loss of local channels. Not having an antenna for probably 25 years the thought never occurred to me until I decided to check out this particular item, which came recommended by a family member and boy was I surprised I have local channels now and no added cost or channels that I would never watch. The setup is easy, simple and the reception  is great, crystal clear channels. I have only encountered one or two brief moments of reception interruption, Which is common occurrence with antennas, which I expected. I would definitely recommend this product.",5,1,2020-3-30,1,1,0
"If you have been wanting to break up with cable, no excuses, this makes it easy!  We were paying for cable and most of the channels were junk, now we are getting what we want for FREE, this is easy to set up and the picture is clear, one room we are getting about 60 to 70 channels and the other room 50 some as there are no windows, but more importantly, no more monthly bill and have what I need and want!  Easy decision!",5,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
"Our experience with the installation and use of the Ultra-Thin HDTV Antenna has exceeded our expectations. We were cautiously optimistic -- expecting the worse, but hoping for the best. To our delight, the latter was true. The antenna was easy to install -- the hardest part was trying to get our ""smart TV"" to program all the stations. Once we were able to program the channels, the antenna only took a little tweaking to locate the best direction of the transmitter signal.The price is right, the installation easy and the reception great. We are very pleased and will be recommending this antenna to family and friends.",5,1,2020-5-2,1,1,0
"Plain and simple, I tried about a half dozen antenna that looked similar to this. Non of them would bringall the stations in my area in. This one was the only one that worked. It proves that it is not what it looks like, but",5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
"Received it two days ago. I had already researched local station and new what direction to target for the best reception. It took about three (3) minutes to setup. Several more minutes to run channel setup on our TV.When the first channel appeared, we were shocked at how clear and sharp the screen was. Changing to our favorite channels, all appeared and were above excellent in reception and clarity.",5,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
I got this antenna to use for an outdoor TV on a covered porch. Could not have been easier to install. Mounted to a covered eave. Pulls in great signal strength. Very happy. Bought 2 more for other televisions.,5,1,2020-8-17,1,2,1
"This digital antenna has brought tv viewing pleasure to our entire family!  I purchased one to try it and it was so easy to install!  My husband was smart and ran the cable up to the attic so we got the best reception ever!  The antenna picks up more channels than we will ever watch.  They include all local channels, HSN, ION (my fav), CNN, ESPN and tons of Spanish channels.  I was so pleased that I ordered 2 more for my adult kids!",5,1,2020-5-9,1,1,0
So much better than our older amplified antenna...no more episodes of fuzziness! Thank you!,5,1,2019-11-3,1,4,0
"I was expecting this antenna to be like all the others I had gotten, but instead it turned out to be just what we should all expect. So many channels and the quality of the picture is outstanding. Very little channels may fuzz a bit during cloudy weather but not anything to worry about as there are doubles on other channels it picks up. I replaced my cable TV and saving so much money now. This product actually is a true value.",5,1,2020-3-27,1,1,0
"Bought this so I could get rid of cable.  Installed it last night and connected it to an AirTV using Sling.  Set-up and installation was super easy and I've been able to receive between 30-50 channels depending on antenna placement.  I live 1/2 way between Baltimore and Washington, DC so there are a lot of channels available but almost all of them are 25-50 miles from my house.  All but the furthest stations come in strong.  Antenna placement and orientation make a difference.  The amplifier improved my reception a bit and pulled in some of the stations that are further away.  I highly recommend trying multiple locations (amplified and not) and then adjust based on the stations that are most important to you.  For example, I get the DC local stations using Sling so I am more interested in a strong signal from the Baltimore stations.",5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"I got 32 crystal clear channels after placing the antenna in the best place possible. A bit disappointed that I couldn't get NBC. I am about halfway between Chicago and South Bend, less than 50 miles to both cities. Both cities have NBC towers. My elevation is 200 ft higher than Chicago and 100 ft higher than South Bend. Plus I'm in a clear rural area. Optimal conditions. This product does deliver however the advertised range is highly suspect. Hence the 3 stars. If you are closer to a tower this product might be perfect for you. I will probably return it and purchase a larger outdoor antenna which will most likely double the amount of channels i receive.",3,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"I bought this HDTV digital antenna on Amazon. It's was showing as a best seller and that it is. It works great! I use it on my new TV in the living room on the first floor of my house. I bought a digital antenna about two years ago for my big screen in my bedroom on the 2nd floor. It needed a power booster to pick up all the local channels and still has bad days on a couple even though I have it 10 feet up the wall of my bedroom since it has a cathedral ceiling. I was worried about this antenna being on the first floor and not having much room to get it up high. I have it sitting on the tv stand behind the tv and it still picks up all the channels with no problem. It has a very, very long coaxil wire to the antenna from the tv but I didn't need to get it up high. The entire assembly is very light weight. I was super surprised by how light weight. It's updated with 2020 standards so that must be making a difference. The price was right and the picture is great. On top of all that, setup took just a couple minutes. I would definitely recommend.Ken L.",5,1,2020-1-26,1,1,0
"We decided to put a hold on our Dish TV service to save money last week, and we were disappointed that we no longer could have the basic local channels. We had heard of other people having satellites for watching TV but never payed much attention to it, and had only tried the antenna that was in our camper when we got it which was spotty because of location reasons. We weren't sure how it would work, and we were pleasantly surprised! We got our local channels plus some! We did have to try a couple different locations for the antenna, and we found that the antenna worked better on the curtain rod above the window sideways than actually in the window. We would definitely recommend this antenna to others. The picture is great, and the price is very reasonable! Thank you for a good product!",5,1,2020-2-9,1,1,0
"Despite the inconsistency of the redundant channels, we don't view either way ... much of the common networks are quite clear; the reception is high definition, in as what has been identified. there are channels i hadn't even heard of, nor can i recall bein’ told of such networks.'bout 7min to install the components + 4 to configure the signals of each received channel",5,1,2020-6-30,1,1,0
I am VERY happy with this antenna! It is the first step in helping me cut the cord! My satellite company does not carry FOX and I had to find a way to watch the Superbowl!Set up was easy. I am by myself and old enough to collect Medicare.  I had to move around a bit for best reception for the channels I am most interested in. The main TV is in the middle of the house and not near windows. I also have a metal roof. I found the sweet  spot for reception in about 20 minutes. A snow squall came thru while I was adjusting with no issues in pixelation.,4,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"Was really optimistic for this after all the positive reviews. Set it up using best practices I could find, in a window, facing the towers as per antenna web. Unfortunately, I still only get the same two Spanish language channels that I can pick up natively with my TV. I have it powered, ensured it was turned on, etc. Maybe I just live in an OTA dead zone. But I was really hoping, based on the reviews of other channels being unlocked that I might get at least a few more.",2,1,2020-9-13,1,1,0
Recently I made the decision to discontinue our major satellite tv service.  We changed to an online streaming plan which includes other platform entertainment.  This new setup suits our household because it has saved us money in the long run.  The only thing missing was our local channels that provided our news channels and sporting events.  I decided to purchase this HDTV antenna after reading a lot of reviews.  I followed all the steps that came with the manual and had it hooked up with five minutes.  I had to manually scan the channels in my TV settings then VOILA!!! Crystal Clear local channels.  I will be purchasing another one to set up in the other room now that I know how easy it is to set up.  Thank you so much for making this easy for me!!!!,5,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0
Unbox was easy and all parts and pieces were accounted for. Installation was straight forward. I really liked the adhesive backing that allowed for easy mounting of the antenna. The cord was plenty long enough and simple to attach into the back of my TV. I was able to search for channels which only took several minutes and I'm receiving all local air channels in resolution 480i and 1080i. The picture is as clear as regular HD from cable so I can easily say my expectations are met. I would recommend this product.,5,1,2019-11-27,1,1,0
"Antenna is very sleek & about the size of a sheet of paper. I mounted mine on the wall behind my 75” LG 4K tv, so it wouldn’t show. I instantly received about 30 channels. I moved it a few times & rescanned the channel’s to get the most I could. Also try turning the booster switch on & off. It helped me receive one local channel that we use frequently. Very pleased so far.",4,1,2020-9-3,1,1,1
I bought this antenna in hopes to be able to cut the cord on Cable. Now B-4 I go on I did buy a new gold pated double shielded co-ax cord 25 foot. I had another cord that length that was quite old and the antenna did not perform like it should. With this new cord and this Antenna I couldn't be happier. I can get 34 channels and I live in Middle of Michigan in the country. One note it does take a little movement around your house to find the most optimum location.,5,1,2020-2-27,1,1,0
"My HDTV antenna has been remarkable.  We were debating about whether or not to get cable TV and decided to give this antenna a try.  It, basically, pulls in everything we need from local news stations as well as some great channels that I never expected to receive.  The quality of the HD channels is amazing!Thanks for a great product!",5,1,2020-9-24,1,1,0
"I got this antenna with some hesitation. The set up was simple enough. Scanned the channels, the number kept getting higher and higher. With our old antenna, it said we had 32 channels, but honestly, we can only get 4 ""on a good day"". I was thinking the same thing was happening with this new antenna. I WAS WRONG!!!We now have so many channels to watch which will allow us to ""cut the cable"" completely! Only will have to pay for the internet now.  This antenna is fantastic!!!",5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
"Easy enough to hook up, but it was really unstable as to getting channels to come in every time. Any movement in the slightest, and channel would get all choppy...if it stayed on at all. Move the antenna even a foot and rescan, and you probably won't get the same channels as before. Way too much trouble to miss with. I would get this cheap antenna if I were you.",2,1,2020-7-29,1,1,0
"I purchased on of these 4K UltgraHD 1080 (2020 edition) digital TV antennas earlier this week. It arrived quickly and in good condition.I opened the box, spent two minutes thumbing through the instructions, took another two minutes to hook up the antenna to the TV, then used the TV’s remote-control to scan, and immediately found 30+ free channels in our viewing area ( 25+ miles southwest of Chicago ).",5,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
Absolutely amazing!! All local channels along with over 100 channels. Made the switch after growing tired of raised cable prices no matter how much i tried to downgrade. The picture is sharp and clear. I hooked this up to the tv in my living room and it works perfectly providing all the channels i watch regularly. I thought I wouldn’t be able to get good reception but I was so happy to be wrong. I’m so happy to cut the cord with the cable company at last!,5,1,2020-2-17,1,1,1
"Need to have a direct line of sight to your local TV stations. I have moved this one 3×3 different levels three different TVs but the mountain to the north of me blocked all signal for my indoor attempts.

"I didn’t put much hopes in this antenna, I had few before and they were a mess. Somebody recommended this one and I said let me try one more time. Amazing! It took about 5 minutes to install and when I did the scan it found 43 channels and they all work beautifully. Picture quality is very good, I placed it right on the window and I suppose this helps a lot. Cant believe I have so many channels without paying a cent for cable companies, I’m blown away!",5,1,2020-2-28,1,1,0
"So far so good. I do wish we could get a longer cable for it. But I can always rearrange the room. Clear picture . Several stations. Even some that we did not get with cable. We turned in the boxes from our spare rooms. No sense in paying for cable boxes in rooms that get very little uses... right?!Will get two more .one for hurricane kit, since the cable likes to go out during the storms. This way we are informed as to the progress and alerts of the storms. Easy to set up.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,1,0
"This is the first time I bought an HDTV antenna. I cut my cable because I don't need it anymore as I have HULU, Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime. I bought this HDTV antenna specifically just for local channels/news. I can pickup up to 42 channels but most are spanish language channels and infomercial channels. I can pickup NBC, Fox and CW channels in HD though the clarity rivals cable broadcast if not better. For my purpose it is worth the money. Thank you.",5,1,2020-3-23,1,1,0
I purchased your HD antenna on Wednesday of last week. I was so impressed with the antenna that I replaced my second antenna with another one of your Antennas. I love it. I had a question when trying to see channels and I emailed tech-support and immediately got a satisfactory answer which allowed me to fix my app TV do you receive all channels. Again I love the product and I recommend it to anybody that needs an HD antenna. Since I connected my antenna I have not watched cable or any other programming whatsoever.  Like I said the  one I had prior to this would never pick up the channels.

This product works perfectly and is going to save us a pile off money from outrageous cable bills being eliminated.  Goodbye cable and hello savings!  I installed this in a few minutes and put it in in area where there is no access to other service. We are able to get 18 different channels to view. A few are not clear but not a big deal. Plenty of others that we normal would watch are. So happy we purchased this that we are getting some for our family to try.,5,1,2019-11-4,1,2,0
"I like this HD antenna.  I am impressed with the range and clarity of the channels received.  Before using this antenna, I received two channels (from a different brand of antenna).  After installing this antenna, I receive 20 channels.  I selected the long range on the amplifier and it helps with the amount of channels that are received.  I definitely recommend this product.",5,1,2020-6-28,1,1,1
I am so disappointed! At the very beginning the antena seemed to work fine but after a month of using it the images freeze in and off  and we lose every information of the show we are watching. We thought that happened only when it was windy outside which happens non stop but even when there is no wind the reception is awful. We don’t enjoy our Spanish novelas anymore because of the bad reception.,1,1,2020-4-29,1,1,0
"My mom decided she couldn't afford her satellite service after another annual increase and asked me to look into an antenna for her as she just wanted to be able to keep her local news channels. After reading all the reviews, I chose this antenna.  The package included all the items needed for a quick and easy install.  I was able to get it working within five minutes and found 100+ digital channels in the metropolitan area. She even discovered channels in her native language that she was never able to get with her previous package. Highly recommend if you are looking for something that is affordable, lightweight and a no brainer to install!",5,1,2020-5-4,1,1,0
"This antenna should be everyone’s go to answer for HDTV channels without having to pay the big cable companies your entire paycheck!Last night there was a storm and all 3 of my family members texted me that their cable went out, meanwhile I was watching tv without any issues as my antenna didn’t respond to the nasty weather!",5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
"I'm very happy with my new HDTV antenna. We realized we only ever watched network TV and streaming services, so we decided to cut the cable cord.I had no idea we could get so many channels in our area. We get about 20 channels with strong signals. Some of them are pretty interesting, with channels devoted to sitcoms, westerns, old game shows, nostalgia TV, etc. And all the main networks have really strong signals that look better than they ever did with cable. There's still plenty of options if we want to lazily flip through channels on a Sunday afternoon.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,1,1

"The range was fine for my needs but there is no way this inexpensive indoor antenna would have a 120 mile range unless one live on top of a lone mountain surrounded by flat plains. I live in Illinois 5 mile from the Wisconsin border. I theoretically should receive TV from Maison WI 103 miles away. I can actually get most Milwaukee and Chicago stations but a few sometimes pixelate at times and those antennas are about 40 to 45 miles away, I live on the edge of a small ridge and I have the antenna near the ceiling of a 2nd floor room. Luckily I can orient the antenna east-west to pick up both cities. The antenna is not multidirectional. The adhesive on the mounting pads is not good. It has fallen off my wall twice in less than a week,",4,1,2020-5-28,1,1,0
"We just received our antenna, right on time.  My husband got it set up in minutes. The picture is clear and stable. We can only get eight channels, but we live in the boonies so we are happy to be getting anything at all Lol. It feels good to be able to watch TV for free, just like in the old days. After cutting the cord and subscribing to three streaming services, we are saving over $1200 a year.

"I purchased this antenna on April 2, 2020 from Amazon.com and installed it when it was delivered on April 5.  Installation was very simple, took only 2 minutes.  In my case, the supplied amplifier was required for reception, may be because of distance between our home and transmission towers or other interference.  However, after using the amplifier, I am receiving all the local over-the-air free channels very clearly.  I installed this antenna because I wanted to have ability to get news and other shows when our streaming service on internet is disrupted for any reason.  Also, I am sure it will be helpful to receive detailed local news during hurricanes.  BTW, the antenna is black on one side and white on the other, which helps it blend with the wall color or other items around it.  It is a great investment for a small price.Disclosure: I am submitting this review of my own free will, but also for an incentive.",5,1,2020-4-14,1,1,0
"I purchased this antenna thinking it was an upgrade from my 50-60 mile range leaf antenna. I was hoping to get FOX Sports (NFL games) from the neighboring state just over the 100-mile mark. Nope. I get the same channels I had with my 50-60 mile antenna. I think the manufacturer should be called out for this. There are clearly enough complaints about their range. Interestingly enough, on the actual packaging they don't specify the range at all; no bold, triple digit mileage claims in sight!If I didn't already own a leaf *and* all the stations I wanted were within 50 miles, I'd say this a fine antenna to start with; I'd probably give it 4 stars. But I would still dock it 1 star because their coaxial cable is built into the leaf which limits your distance to 4-6 feet (I'm not sure how long that cable is). My older leaf has a 'female' coax connection at the bottom of the leaf. From there I can attach my long coaxial cable. (Unfortunately, my HDTV resides on the opposite side of the house from all the TV signals.) With this newer one, I have to use a female-to-female cable joiner to extend my coax run.  It's always best to having fewer breaks in a cable run. Plus, I am suspicious of the thinness of this coax cable that hangs off the leaf.  I question if it has enough shielding.  Usually coaxial cable is thick and miserably stiff, but maybe coax cabling has changed/improved in the last 10 years or so.",2,1,2020-9-24,1,0,0
"I have Dish network and recently ABC pulled their channel over a dispute for more money so I decided I needed to try an antenna to get their broadcast. I found this antenna and am so happy I did. It was super easy to connect and my TV found 99 channels when going through the scan - yeah I said 99 channels. I live in metro Phoenix area which is really spread out and am far away from the towers. I tried a digital TV antenna a few years back and it was frustrating because what channels it did find, just pixellated all day long and it didn't even pick up all the main ones. This one does.

"The install of the antenna was simple and straight forward.  I was surprised to find it very thin and flexible.  That however did not keep it from getting a strong signal.  In fact I found the lightness of the antenna to be an advantage when mounting it.  I actually taped it to the wall directly behind the TV.  I tested it with and without plugging in the signal booster.  In my case I am about 20-40 miles from the TV tower depending on the station.  I found even I could get a decent signal without the booster, but powering it up gave an even better one.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0
"Not as advertised. I live less than 15 miles from every major TV network in the city, and doesn't even pick up the signal for ABC. 98 percent of the channels are in 480i. I don't have any obstacles that could block the signal; therefore, it is a waste of money. I tried on both of my two 65"" TVs, but it didn't work.

I get over 70 channels without the amplifier. I live on the north side of Dallas, Texas.I simply have it resting on the top of my entertainment center. I didn’t even need to secure it to a window or wall. It’s that powerful.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,1,0
"I live near Chicago and after doing the channel search I was surprised to see nearly 70 channels! This little antenna works great. I just have to say pay attention to the instructions. Since you can't really adjust the antenna, i.e. moving the wands around, you can only move it to a new spot for a better signal. The instructions say to place the antenna in a window. I would like to add, make sure the window faces the direction of the broadcast tower. In my living room, the only window faces to the south, Chicago is to the east. A good portion of the channels came in fine in the southern window, but a lot of them don't come in the best. I put the the antenna in a bedroom that has a window that faces to the east and every channel comes in clear as a bell. I would say if you are looking for a simple, relativity cheap antenna, that you know you have a good spot for, this work great.",5,1,2020-7-2,1,1,0

Set up was very easy (less than 10 min) and we love the slim profile.  You can't see the antenna. We placed on top of a curio cabinet next to the tv. It is so slim you can't see it up there and the wires are long enough to run behind the curio and up to the top. Great product and have recommended to friends.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"So we lost our free cable we have had for the last 4 years, and are really unwilling to pay a ton to Xfinity/Frontier/direct TV and so on. Even though it has been well reviewed I wasn't sure if it would work right here in the pacific Northwest. Install, probably took me longer to unbox it and read the directions as it did to install it.Ran the channel search, wonderful results, locals, CBS news, and it integrated with the TV1 program that came with our Samsung HDTV. One time, $30.00, take that cable guys!",5,1,2020-2-28,1,1,0
"I tried this with and without the amplifier and there are zero channels coming in at all. I feel like I got scammed because of all these great reviews that claim this thing works like a charm. Its not like I'm in a rural area either, I would expect to get something at least.",1,1,2020-2-13,1,3,0
"Last week we decided enough is enough with the cable company that provides us television. Every year the prices just keep going up! I have to be honest though, I was a little scared and hesitant because I didnt know what to expect getting TV over the air, but at this point I was just fed up with cable. So yes, we pulled the plug and added this digital tv antenna and I couldnt be happier! I wish I would have done this years ago!. Quality is 4K HD and I get my local channels and was even able to watch monday night football. The antenna works amazing, just do your due diligence and research your local towers. We are subscribed to Amazon plus, Disney+, and Netflix.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
"Pretty big, about the size of a sheet of paper. Super easy to put together and install. Easy instructions. Took me less than 10 min to do it. Went from 42 channels to 261 channels. My hubby got ESPN so he’s happy. I got HSN so I’M happy! Used it for my 65” TV and bought another for my 40” TV, works awesome on both. Came fast (4days) despite this pandemic. I’m satisfied. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!",5,1,2020-5-12,1,1,0
"So far this antenna has given me 6 channels of old sitcoms. Those streamed fairly well and I had an easy time installing this antenna. However, if I can't get any additional channels to load, I'll probably just return this antenna.It is well made and shipped quickly.  I'm not sure that this will end up suiting my needs, and I live in a suburban area about 15 miles west of Chicago. I would expect this antenna to perform better than it has so fair. However, the product seems well made and the value for the money is good.",3,1,2020-9-25,1,0,0
Just purchased the U Must Have Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna to replace the Leaf that we were using.  The installation was very easy - love that this comes with an amplifier.  Having the amplifier allowed us to receive more channels.  The picture is very clear and we no longer have to get up to move the antenna to stop static.  Am sure we will be replacing our other Leaf antennas after trying this one for a while.  Well worth it!!!,5,1,2020-1-9,1,1,0
"We wanted to add another TV to our home. Our cable company wanted to charge us $6.99 a month for a regular box an $9.99 for an HD box.  Our main concern was to be able to watch Jazz basketball Real soccer, both local channels. When we installed the antenna we were amazed at the quality of the picture and the amount of other channels we were able to pickup. We moved the antenna around the room several times until we got the best reception. The antenna will pay for itself in less than 3 months.",5,1,2020-3-13,1,1,0

"My wife and I wanted a TV in the kitchen and we both decided it would be good for the kids as well. The kids would always bring their foods into the living room and would make a mess. So we decided a 43"" Samsung TV would be good. We wall mounted the TV but I couldn't get any local channels to work without an antenna. I decided to look on Amazon and searched for a ""TV antenna"". So I looked at the ""Best Sellers"" section and I was wowed with over 12,000 plus the number of reviews. I made no hesitation on waiting and purchased one. Two days later the antenna arrived at the house. I took it out the box and loved how thin it was. It was perfect for me to mount onto the back of my TV. After hooking it up, I did a channel scan and 40 plus HDTV stations popped up. That means I received every digital station over the course of 50 pulse miles I would say. It's been over a week now and it never disappointed me with weak signals. I would definitely purchase more to replace all my other antennas in the house.",5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,1
The advertising is misleading. Claims of ability to pull in signals from 120 miles away are super best scenario only. According to tower locator web site we are 18 miles from most broadcast towers. Our TV is next to an exterior wall on the wrong side of the house. In order to pull in signals we had to run a cable from the TV to an window on the opposite side of the house. Even then about half of the signals are strong enough for viewing while the remaining 50% fade in and out even with the included amplifier connected and powered up. A more honest description of this product should be on Amazon's web site. Let the buyer beware if you purchase one of these. It might work or it might not depending on all your variables.,1,1,2020-1-20,1,1,0
"Received the Digital HDTV Antenna today and hooked it up to my Samsung TV. Good and clear instructions and everything worked from the start. I plugged it into the Antenna In inlet (I have cable but the box is connected to one of the HDMI connectors). I live in the Washington DC area and got 36 channels with good quality. That included the main networks, two three PBS channels, one movie channel and a number of TV shows and shopping ones. I also tried to attach the amplifier but then I only got 20 channels and the quality was worse.I am very happy with the purchase. The instructions and set up were good and the result too. I will keep cable, at least for now, but the channels now available by air is a good complement and also a good insurance if and when the cable service is down. Having both PBS and the major networks by air is good in case of an emergency. I would certainly recommend this product.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,1,0
"I had my doubts about the antenna working in our area as it claims.  I have ordered others in the past and didn’t have much luck but was wanting to cut the cable.  I have Hulu, but it is still nice to be able to watch local tv for the news or if I just want to watch a local program.  To my surprise every channel cam in and I enjoy watching regular tv.  It has been so great that I have also let my parents know because they also live in a remote location and do not pay for cable, but have seen a deterioration of the channels quality over the last few years with the updated technology.  There’s also works great and they didn’t have to hire someone to come out and install an updated outdoor antenna and it sits easily without notice so they can watch there tv.  It has been so popular they have ordered one for their lake home for those rainy days when they cannot be outside.",5,1,2020-4-8,1,1,0
My mother lives in a rural area and the cable and internet have been out since Hurricane Laura. I bought her this GESOBYTE HD amplified antenna so she could see some local news and television. It was very easy to set up. I was shocked at the number of channels we received and their quality! I was expecting maybe 5-6 channels for the area we live in but we get 15 channels and all of them are crystal clear!! We get a better picture quality with this antenna than we ever did with cable! Best money I’ve spent! We may just cut the cord!,5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"It was so easy to install.  I was going to wait for my grandson to put it together for me, but after I read the usermanual I knew I was good to go.  I have a perfect picture and it's not on the wall or in the window just laying",4,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"This is probably the best HD Antenna I've had over the years. I've tried so many and all of them could barely hold a signal. Not with this one, would rarely experience any chugging when watching TV. Out of the box, this thing is easy to put together and mount on the wall. Everything you need is already included, even the mounting tape. I would personally recommend this product to all my family who are looking into purchasing an HD antenna.",5,1,2020-5-1,1,1,0
"I bought this for a friend of mine that lives near Springfield, MS so I thought I would try it here in SW Florida.  I already have OTA on my roof here and get around 80+ channels.  I was just curious as to if this would work as advertised.  It didn't.  I hooked it to two different TV's and when I scanned for channels it came up with zero.  Tried moving the antenna to different locations and still nothing.  My guess is that you have to live pretty close to the broadcast locations in order for this to work.  Their description is a little misleading.  So unless you live close to a big city I wouldn't give this one a try.  My friend did try it in Springfield and received around 60 channels so like I said it works fine near larger population areas.",4,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
"I'm very pleased, especially for what I paid. ""Installation"" was easy as can be (how complex can using double sided tape and plugging it into your TV get?). Some channels get somewhat choppy on really cloudy days, but that's nothing unique to this antenna.  I am dropping a star because I don't get anything close to the advertised 200 miles worth of range, but I also didn't expect to. My TV doesn't recognize channels broadcasting more than about 30 miles away.",4,1,2020-9-3,1,2,0
"I thought I'd take a $20 dollar chance on this device, since the other alternative was $50 per month from the local cable company.  Wow!  I was surprised!  This little device brings in all of the local channels (20 of them) crystal clear.  I live in southern Oregon, the transmitting stations are scattered around the area, but this little device brings them all in.  I''m very pleased with this purchase.",5,1,2020-2-24,1,1,0

"My cable bill was had increased over $100 in the last year. I wasn't even getting any of the extra movie channels either. After getting rid of my cable I still wanted to watch my local channels, which was what I mostly watched anyway on cable. After receiving my antenna I found out just how easy it was to install. I was up and watching local TV within minutes. I was wondering what kind of picture clarity I was going to be receiving. It was so clear I couldn't tell the difference between free air TV and the cable I had just freed myself up from.",5,1,2020-3-21,1,1,0
"This is my second antenna I bought off of Amazon. I bought this just because of the Amazon's choice. I lived in Broomfield, CO and I was able to get multiple channels. With this antenna, I probably have 20% of what I received with the other antenna. I know there is nothing wrong with the product. I'm just located at the base of the mountains. When I move away from this area, I know that the reception will be better.",5,1,2020-1-27,1,1,0
This works a million times better than my existing antenna. I get about 50 channels that are super clear and consistently work. The antenna seems to be decent quality and the wires are thicker than my older antenna. The length of the coax is great because you can mount your antenna pretty far away from the tv. Very satisfied with this antenna. Would definitely recommend.,5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
I ordered this after hearing about digital antennas from a friend. This absolutely exceeded my expectations. I get about 50 channels and the picture is crystal clear. My only regret is that I didn’t know about this product sooner.This specific antenna was super easy to install and even comes with double sided stickers to hang it up. The cord is nice and long so you can move it to get the most channels possible.,5,1,2020-8-16,1,1,0
"My family is so happy to have free HDTV antenna! I lost my job because i was injured and couldnt afford to pay cable tv anymore for 2 years until today! I worked part time and saved a bit of money so i could buy 1 antenna and were so thankful for this. I get to watch news now and some channels too! It has comedy channels, cooking channel, kids channel and of course the local news that's the most important one for me! I highly recommend this to everybody! In fact, if i save enough again I'd buy one just so my son could have another one in his room so he can watch kids show whenever he wants! Awesome!",5,1,2020-2-9,1,0,0
"I live about 40 miles outside of Detroit, kind of no man's land when it comes to over the air TV signals. I spent about $75 on one of those outdoor antennas, went through the trouble of running coax from my back yard and got about 8 viewable channels. In a moment of disappointment, I decided to give the indoor antenna a try. I ordered the GB to give it a try. It arrived in one day. After putting it on the wall and doing a channel scan I doubled the channels in reach. I then stuck it in a window and now have about triple the channels I had with the troublesome outdoor antenna, at about a third the price. Live and learn I guess.Rich in Clarkston",5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
"It works perfect.  So perfect that I ordered a second one.When I saw the card offering a free antenna I was ecstatic because I could use another one!  No more cable for me, this antenna gives me a PERFECT picture and you would never know by looking at the screen that I wasn’t on cable.  I have gone from $150 per month for cable and so many channels I have never even watched to paying $0 to watch my tv.  Thank you so much for this product .",5,1,2019-11-10,1,1,0

I pulled this antenna out of the box and with-in 5 minutes, I was scanning for channels on my TV. I live on the outskirts of town with most of my locals coming from a neighboring city and even with that distance between my antennas and the stations, I pulled in all the major locals and several other channels I didn't even realize were available!

Although living in a northern Chicago suburb, I still could not pull much in with this inexpensive TV coupled to the Mohu.  Read about this unit which is far less money.  It is superior in pulling in a stronger signal for more channels.  It's lightweight, flexible, easy to place anywhere, etc.  You usually get what you pay for, but in this case, you get more for less!",4,1,2020-6-6,1,1,0
"My husband I bought this for local news channels. Before we purchased we checked to see what was available in our area, and we were happily surprised that the news channels we wanted were available.

Tried it with and without the amplifier. Total disappointment!",1,1,2020-2-15,1,1,0

Will recommend to my friends. Thanks so much.",5,1,2020-1-24,1,1,0
"Update: they made me change my original 4 star review to this in order to get the free antenna they offer you when you receive this one. It's an ok antenna, but just take this into consideration when purchasingWhile I didn't get as many channels as others and it took a while for me to get the 23 channels that I now have, it works pretty well. The reception is great with almost no pixelation and it is very easy to install and search for channels.",5,1,2020-5-9,1,1,0
"I ordered this for my dad and was skeptical since we had no luck with previous antennas. My dad uses a converter box to watch vietnamese channels but since the box had no signal for most of the programs, we needed to replace it. It was difficult searching for an antenna with specifically viet channels but I gave this a try anyway since there were 2 previous reviews about this antenna having viet channels. I'm so glad I got it because it was able to bring back all 17 of those viet channels with great quality!

"We recently got rid of our cable TV, except for the most basic package on the one TV in the room the modem is in because bundling is stupid and it would've cost more to get rid of it entirely and just have internet than to severely downgrade. I found this while looking into a digital antenna for the upstairs TV, which now has more channels than the one that still has the jank cable(which isn't even in HD).It was very simple to install and set up, and aside from having more channels than I expected, it works with the channel guide button on the smart TV. I was expecting to just have to memorize station numbers and channel-surf to see what was on like in ye olden times. For $25 you can't beat it.",5,1,2020-1-21,1,0,0
"So I have bought a few HD antenna's since we cut our cable due to the rising cost.  These HD antenna's are quite amazing!

Like everyone else in the new decade I stream everything so I canceled my Charter after searching high and low for an antenna to get my local channels.  The set up was quick and easy.  I put the antenna on the wall next to my TV searched for channels and it found 26 channels.  I will move it closer to the window to see if I can find more but for now I'm satisfied with my 26 channels.  I have all my local channel with good quality.  It doesn't buffer a lot and the cords are long enough to move around.  They provide you with everything in the box you need to installation even extra adhesive to stick it to wherever you want to.,5,1,2020-2-11,1,0,0
"I got this to get live TV, particularly to hear the news in the morning.  It was a bit hard to figure out that the white side was supposed to face the window for it to work but for others, it might be simple to figure out.  I got 44 channels and it’s clear.  When I switch to a different tv, facing the backyard, certain channels lag as there’s blockage.  However it is so much better than having rabbit ears and the price is on point.  The length of the cable is enough for me but if you’re going to drag it far from the window, you may want a bit more length.  Mine works great when it’s placed against the window.  If it faces South, you don’t even need it up against the window.  It works if it’s close enough.  I would recommend this product for sure!",5,1,2020-4-10,1,1,0
"I purchased this antenna for my basement guest room.  I am totally amazed!  It works even better than I could have imagined.

Installed it on the north window on the first story using the two-sided stickers.  It's hidden by the top curtain and virtually invisible.  We're about 35 miles from downtown among hills that tend to block signals so I needed an antenna that would amplify the signals.  We cut the cord with cable because we mostly watch the local channels anyway and are saving ourselves $80 a month.  Unfortunately, the cable company doubled our internet bill because we no longer bundle, but the savings per month are worth it.",5,1,2019-11-8,1,2,0

I now get the 5 main channels (along with 130 other digital channels).  I live a few miles outside of Boston and the picture quality is incredible.  I have a 4K TV and after setup, the default channel, which had a Big10 basketball game on, looked exactly like 4K definition.  The only drawback is my location within the house.  I had to place the antenna in a more interior location, and when it rains hard with heavy cloud cover, the signal is spotty (to be expected).  Still, I'd much rather deal with that occasionally for a one time price of $27.99 than continuously pay monthly for cable.  I highly recommend this digital antenna for anyone looking to stick it to the cable company!  Worth every penny.",5,1,2020-2-20,1,1,0
I just cut the cord with dish. To save money. A lot of money. This HDTV antenna is just perfect. I get all the local channels plus a lot more than I expected. 22 Channels to be exact. It scanned 30 but then I deleted the ones I didn’t need. The picture quality is exceptional. Actually the HD signal is clearer than what Dish produced. Easy set up. It hangs on the wall just behind the dresser mirror. I can’t even see it.I’ll be sure the tell my friends the quality of this antenna.,5,1,2020-7-23,1,1,0
"I was very excited to use this antenna, and the set up was super easy. Unfortunately, I don't think I am in a good area, (lots of trees around my apartment) so I didn't get as many channels as everyone said they did. My situation was different, but I did get clearer channels than usual but lost a few from my previous tv antenna. I would make a suggestion, however, to provide some sort of stand for the antenna. After messing with the antenna for about half an hour, I discovered the clearest quality was standing it upright on a table near the window/wall. I had to create a contraption, but it would be nice to have some sort of mount or holder come with the device.",5,1,2020-9-6,1,1,0
"Just installed this antenna and everything seems fine so far. Channel setup scan on the TV indicated it found 54 channels.

I didn't want to have to pay for cable to get the basic channels and I found this antenna while researching other ways to get access. Just follow the instructions with setting up near a window, do a channel scan, and you're done! The first scan I did was with the antenna further from the window and it missed a couple channels, but once I properly placed it there was no issue.FYI make sure to check the signal strength by going to the URL in the description. That way you can make sure you're in the right range to pick up signal for the channels you want with this product.",5,1,2020-5-23,1,1,0

I'm very happy I purchased this antenna.",5,1,2020-2-28,1,1,0

I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to set up and I am receiving many more channels with this antenna than I had with previous ones. Happy to have selected this one!!Regards, Boomer",5,1,2020-2-14,1,1,0
"I just installed my Gesobyte antenna on September 13, 2020. I was instantly amazed at how well this device worked! I now get channels I never had before with my rooftop antenna. My sister bought this antenna and recommended it to me. I will tell anyone who wants to drop cable to get a Gesobyte antenna right away. Now I need another one for my bedroom TV because football is going to be on ALL day on Sundays and my husband and boys will be hogging the living room television!Thanks so much for a great product at an affordable price!",5,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
I recently purchased one of your U Must Have HDTV Antennas because my satellite provider had dropped FOX and my local FOX station.  This antenna has been one of the best investments I’ve made in a long time as it not only picked up my FOX station but all the local stations and several more a couple of which aren’t offered on satellite.  The instructions say to move the antenna around for the best reception and every way I've moved it I pickup different channels giving me another option of what I want to watch.  I’ve since cancelled the local channels subscription through my satellite provider and I even get better reception on my locals.  This is a great product and well worth considering over cable or satellite or as an enhancement for TV.,5,1,2020-2-8,1,1,0
"My experience with this antenna was honestly better then any other brand out there in the market. Although the difference in price it is definitely worth to invest in this.It completely filled my expectations and what the commercial advertising says. I will be repurchasing more for my business too and definetly recommend this product to customers, friends, and family.",5,1,2020-2-12,1,1,0
"What am I doing wrong?It's SO easy to set up, but....why can't I get any channels?",1,1,2020-3-17,1,2,0
Received my HDTV antenna today.  I actually bought one so I could see if this will work for my mom and dad.  I hooked it up to one tv and I was surprised at how many channels we received and the clarity of the audio and video.  Setup of the hardware and programming the channels were super simple on my Samsung TV.  I'll be setting up one or more of these at my house and at least one at my parents house.  I am going to try to set up one for my parents whole house ( 4 TVs).,5,1,2019-12-28,1,1,0
We bought this a little over a week ago and are so happy with our purchase! It took my husband a while to convince this would be a great purchase but he is a believer now. He was nervous this would have to be by a window or hang on the wall where people could see it. We have it hanging behind the TV and no one even knows. We are saving over $100 a month now by cutting cable. We have a TV guide app and it alerts us when a show is coming on that we want and then we still get to watch it in HD.,5,1,2020-4-14,1,1,0
"I'm in Redmond WA at the top of a 5-story building and I got NOTHING. Followed the instructions, plugged it in to a power source, repositioned until the cows came home, cross-eyed, and ""Channel/signal not available"" is my diagnosis.

"I was skeptical at first since we previously purchased a named brand attic HGTV antenna for $200 that barely even received 12 channels, and not even our local television stations. Well I am seriously impressed! This antenna cost less than $30, has MUCH simpler instructions, and receives over 40 channels INCLUDING OUR LOCAL CBS/NBC/ABC!! We will be cancelling our Direct TV today! This is the best HGTV antenna that we have tried...and we have tried a LOT of them. Thank you!!!",5,1,2020-5-31,1,1,0
"I bought this antenna as a Father's Day gift for my husband. He'd gotten a TV as a service reward at work and we wanted to be able to use it without incurring high cable fees. We are retired and trying to keep monthly expenses to a minimum. We set up our new antenna in less than 20 minutes.  It was super easy to do. We now receive over 60 channels and the transmission is crisp and clear.  Even though our neighborhood is surrounded by hills, the reception is great. We are very happy with this purchase.",5,1,2020-6-22,1,1,0
"WOW!!!! I’ve used a couple different amplified rabbit-ear antennas over the last five years with diminishing results. On a great day I could get 10 channels to come in and remain fairly stable. Without even running a fresh channel scan, I simply plugged in this new HD TV antenna and have 32 channels that are absolutely crystal clear without any distortion or audio cut out! I seriously thought this was just a marketing gimmick anWithout even running a fresh channel scan, I simply plugged in this new HD TV antenna and have 32 channels that are absolutely crystal clear without any distortion or audio cut out! I seriously thought this was just a marketing gimmick, But I was tired of watching football games and having them cut out. I sound like a paid advertiser, but this product has completely blown away my expectations! I hoped my 10 channels would come in just a little bit better and instead my kids spent the morning watching three different PBS channels that we haven’t got with our old antennas in the last five years. Not sure who to think, but thank you for your product! I would absolutely recommend this with 10 stars to anyone and everyone I know!",5,1,2019-11-28,1,1,0
"I grabbed internet from my local provider, ""For $5 more you can get TV"". Naturally I took the deal, ""Oh by the way it's another $10 a month for the box"", again I'm in $15 extra a month, that's just over whatever streaming service you have.  Flash forward a year and my bill balloons another $50.  I cut the cord and gained over 50 channels with HDTV Antenna.  Works for me as I mostly watch the same couple of channels on cable. Picture is great!",5,1,2020-2-17,1,1,0
We had zero channel reception in the bedroom. I installed the antenna in minutes and then ran a channel scan. I get a fair number of channels and the picture is quite good. I don't a few channels I wanted but they are more than 70 miles away and I didn't expect that I would get them. I'm pleased with the purchase and would recommend this item.,5,1,2020-6-30,1,1,0
"We purchased our HDTV antenna in hopes that we might be able to finally cut our cable costs, saving us about $100/month.  And, with our HDTV antenna, we can now bring in more than 30 TV stations, including ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, and more.But the wonderful surprise was that the picture quality is so much better, sharp and clear, much better than cable.  I now know that cable transmits a condensed picture, and that the HDTV picture is not condensed, but, no knowing that at the beginning, we were amazed at how beautiful the picture quality is.",5,1,2020-6-1,1,1,0
I didn't get any more channels than I did with my old one. It was supposed to increase the reception from 90 to 120 miles. I was hoping to get a local pbs station that I used to get a few years ago but no such luck. I live on a ridge in a wooded area which affects reception. I am keeping it because it's less awkward than my old one. The hd channels come through clearly.,4,1,2020-3-20,1,1,0
"I bought this HDTV Antenna with amplifier for the replacement of the old one. After the easy installation (just plugged-in to the TV), now I got 60 local channels in the North DFW area that is +30 more than the previous one.

"Joined the ranks of cord cutters but still wanted to get local channels for news and local sports. Picked up two of these - one for upstairs and one for the basement. The upstairs TV picked up a few more channels than the basement one, so that just goes to show that placement does matter. But I get all the channels I wanted on both of them. Picture and sound work just fine.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
"We have this sitting area near our pond and butterfly garden. We installed a TV, but found our WiFi didn’t reach that far. We invested in a 2nd hotspot from our cellular supplier, but it turned out to be too expensive for what little time we set out there  We then tried using our phone as a “ hotspot” which worked for a while, but then our phone reception began to get poor as was our home TV reception (we are on an old school antenna atop the house). I decided to order an amplified one online for the house. Before it arrived, I had the thought to try it on the TV in our outdoor sitting area first. It took 5 minutes to install and after scanning channels, we had 46 channels that all played fine. I’m now going to order more of these amplified antennas for every TV in the house",5,1,2020-6-15,1,1,1
"To be honest when I opened the package and see for the first time the piece of paper as an antenna; the idea of the item to work was negative, when I followed the introductions and see the images very clear, I was shocked and happy. The only uncomfortable thing is to position the antenna in different places until I reached the desired channels.I will give you five stars.....",5,1,2020-2-28,1,1,0
Easy to hook up and at an amazing price. I was skeptical when I ordered the antenna. However when it came in I hooked it up and did a scan and bam we picked up 17 channels. Now we live in the middle of nowhere and 22 miles from anywhere. We were worried we wouldn’t be able to pick up certain channels due to the tower being well over 40 miles. Well we picked up that tower and towers beyond that. Absolutely Amazing product. Good job!!,5,1,2020-4-13,1,1,0
"Great reception and it's not blocking my view out a window. I laid it on top of a bookcase and can't even see it.  I connected it to my old DirecTV connection in my den. Went outside where the dish had been connected to ""input"" on the splitter. Switched the other end of the den connected cable from ""output""  to ""input"" on the splitter. Disconnected cable boxes in each room and connected cable to TV in each room.  Now have three TVs and a digital converter/recorder on this antenna. Each device can be set to a different channel at same time. It's better than satellite ... it's free HDTV.",5,1,2020-6-22,1,1,0
"I have to say, this antenna could not have been easier to set up, and I am no techie!I like how it literally began scanning to find available channels. I was so thrilled to get the MPT public channels; they are crystal clear! I also got ABC too, and other great channels.",5,1,2020-4-6,1,1,0
"I ordered it on April 11th and it was at my doorstep by 1p today, April 14th. That was a super fast delivery with no issues. The packaging was super thin, not what I was expecting. What a great surprise. The digital antenna was ultra thin and very easy to unpack and set up. I had it ready to go in less than 2 minutes. My first scan I was able to find 40 channels. After moving the antenna to the opposite side of my sliding door and attaching the amplifier, I was able to access another 9 channels. I live in an area that gets pretty bad cell phone signal and cable reception so I didn’t expect more stations than I accessed. All in all, my experience has been excellent. I would definitely order again for my other tv’s",5,1,2020-4-14,1,1,0
"I am a health care professional, person that loves electronics and technology and have recently cut the cord on my cable.  I have three TVs in my home: one in my office, one in the living room, and one in the master bedroom. I have bought several generic digital antennas and have had mixed experiences with them.  I constantly have to move them around to find reception.I recently bought the U MUST HAVE Digital HDTV Antenna from Amazon.com- primarily because of it's great reviews and it's presence on the home site on the amazon website.  This antenna works great, I believe the digital amplifier helps get reception and rarely have to move the antenna.  It is very compact and does not take a lot of space.  I was able to detect over 30 channels on air with this antenna and I am able to watch all my NFL football games (local) on Sundays- which is the number one reason I subscribed to cable.  It is also compatible with the fire stick- which is such a huge plus! I am satisfied with the product and would love to get a free HDTV antenna for my other rooms!",5,1,2019-12-1,1,1,0
"We recently purchased this antenna after our old antenna had such bad problems with freezing and not consistently picking up the various channels that we were watching.  We received the order very quickly after purchasing and did not have any issues with shipping.  Though we haven't had it long, so far picture quality has been great!  It seems to pick up a larger number of channels than the old antenna and we have not had any issues thus far with freezing or poor reception.  We would definitely purchase again in the future (if we need it).  We will update the review if we have any problems in the future.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,1,0

"My HDTV antenna arrived on Friday. Had it installed in a jiff. One word describes how it works,.. FANTASTIC. I couldn't be more pleased. I have tried other brands and ended up taking them back to the store. The review you have on Amazon was spot on. I tried the antenna without the amplifier and received 12 channels, using the amplifier, I now get tons more. Thank you for your product!",5,1,2020-2-2,1,1,0
"We decided to ""cut the cable cord"" last month and narrow down our TV options to just local channels, Netflix & Amazon.  We were shocked at how easy this thing was to install (just screw into the back of the TV, and let the TV scan for available channels).. and boom - it's up & running!  We have ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, PBS & about 10 other channels we didn't even know we'd get access to.. free tv!  Great customer service so far, and we will be getting another one to put on our second TV!  Highly recommend - 10/10!",5,1,2020-3-23,1,1,0
"On Superbowl LIV Sunday we had several people over for a party and an hour before the kickoff disaster struck!!! Our Cable quit working, we had lost all internet and cable service. With game time getting closer and closer we were all trying to figure out what to do or where to go. One of our guests said that he had a HDTV antenna and rushed home to get it, when he returned we quickly hooked it up and scanned for channels. Within a matter of a few minutes we had reception and just in time for the beginning of the Superbowl.After the game I unhooked the antenna and made note of the brand. The following day I ordered on online at Amazon.com, I hooked it up when it arrived two days later and I could not be happier as this was a newer model and it works great!!!",5,1,2020-2-6,1,1,0
"I purchased this antenna to try to get some local channels on my 2nd TV that has no cable tv access.  The antenna is amazingly sensitive about receiving channels.  In my situation, I have only west-facing windows in that room.  TV stations are about 50 miles due north and 60 miles due east of my home.  I pull in 16 channels from the north including a few UHF channels surprisingly.  Some of these channels aren't even on my cable subscription for my primary television, which is a plus!.  ALL my channels have 4 & 5 bars reception and excellent audio!  I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.  Sure saved me a bundle of $$$ by not having to install an outdoor antenna and rotor!",5,1,2020-2-21,1,1,0
"It was a simple plug-in to the TV, and since we live in an urban area, short range setting is fine. At first, it was glitchy when resting the antenna at the back of the TV stand, where our TV found 18 channels, but glitchy off-and-on. Then, when placing the antenna higher up on the wall with some simple wall putty, it found 40 channels and is clear.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,1,1
I just received mine last night.  The web pages for coverage was less than helpful.  I took a chance anyway.  I wanted to get the local.  I set it up using less than 35 miles and long range.  No real difference.  Scanned for channels.  Move the antenna.  Scanned. Moved.  About 30 minutes box to finish.  I am getting about 25 channels.  Some I won't use (in Spanish or shopping networks),5,1,2020-6-29,1,1,1
"I purchased an HD antenna for my home about 6 months ago so I can watch the news and weather when cable is out. Setting up this antenna was very easy and took less than 5 minutes to complete. After turning on the TV, I switched the channel to the local news and had a crystal clear picture. I have used this many times as I tend to lose cable during storms and the antenna always worked.A couple months after installing the antenna, I cancelled cable as I realized that many of the channels I paid for with cable I could watch for free with the antenna. This was a great purchase and would definitely recommend it to everyone.",5,1,2020-9-1,1,1,0
"We live in a rural area of the Ozarks. My tv satellite provider blocked one of our local channels so I checked out this antenna. I was skeptical it would draw a signal at all.

Take that satellite provider. I suppose you could say we ""dished"" them.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
Very lightweight very easy to install. Lots of different options for installation I enjoyed the switch for close towers to long tower distance.

"After weeks of fighting with an old antenna on my RV I ordered an HDTV Antenna thinking what do I have to lose. I hooked it up and reprogramed my TV and immediately got 55 channels, all with crystal clear pictures.  I even hooked the antenna into a splitter for another TV and the results were the same, great pictures on both TV's.  I have since travelled across Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Missouri and continue to have great results.I look forward to getting the additional antenna to use in my permanent home.",5,1,2020-3-11,1,1,0
"I purchased this antenna from amazon for my camper, in which I have a small TV.  I hoped to get a local station at the campgrounds and other sites that I stay at to be able to hear the news and weather, but I was pleasantly surprised to get at least 5-6 channels in remote places and many more in campgrounds.  I also like that the antenna works off USB allowing me to power it and the TV from my 12 volt system.  It is a good product; small , light, easy to use and it is a nice addition to my camping.",5,1,2020-6-5,1,2,0

The antenna id flat and can be placed anywhere nicely!!!",5,1,2020-4-4,1,1,0
"As soon as I plugged in this antena to my tv I was able to watch the channel I was previously watching. I couldn’t believe I didn’t have to scan for channels. So I went into my TV guide and it scrolled down through various channels as they were loading. Awesome purchase. I was just testing the product. Since I bought it because I am in the process of relocating and I will need an antenna when I move. I might have to scan when I connect the antenna permanently. However, already impressed and happy with this antenna. Awesome picture quality too!",5,1,2020-1-24,1,1,0
"So far I am happy wit this purchase. I am able to receive many (around 60) channels with very clear crisp picture quality. We have been without cable/satellite for some time utilizing Netflix, Hulu, Prime etc for programming. Being able to watch football this weekend was great removing the issue with some web based options. Initially, I placed it on the stand just to see how many channels I could receive. After trial and error with placement (and I’m sure it could be moved again), I settled on the location above the tv. I was slightly off from my target area and because the adhesive is so strong (pulled part of the wall when I attempted to move it) I left it where it was. That would be my biggest gripe. An additional set of adhesive tabs would be helpful for those who need to reposition.",4,1,2020-9-22,1,0,1

After buying the HDTV antenna, the instruction for installation was very easy to follow. Within minutes, we were able to get signals from nearly 40 channels, and reception has been good ever since. We are  glad that we  bought the antenna and recommend others that are interested in saving money, esp. in these days of high employment and enormous monthly fees with companies like Comcast/Xfinity, to try this HDTV antenna, which is affordable.THANKING YOU",5,1,2020-4-18,1,1,0

"I purchased the antenna through Amazon based on the reviews and the advertised 120 mile antenna range. I had recently purchased $80 indoor digital antenna from Best Buy and ended up taking it back after hooking it up and realizing it was no better than the cheap Sylvania antenna (I’ve had for 8+ years) it was to replace. So, I purchased the Ultra-Thin Antenna to give it a shot. Set-up of the Utlra-thin was a snap! After running the digital scan on my HDTV, I was able to pick up 33 channels! Including the VERY elusive CBS!! My location is approximately 50-60 miles from the station, and though I used to get CBS with my old antenna most of the time, for whatever reason I no longer could receive the signal. And another great thing about the Ultra-thin, the picture clarity seams so much sharper, and I no longer have to move the antenna to pick-up the channels - I used to have to due this constantly with my former Sylvania antenna. This was a great purchase - low cost ($27.90) and great performance. I’d love to have another for my upstairs TV!",5,1,2019-12-4,1,1,0

The antenna is the black rectangle against the wall.I cut the cable over 10 years ago, but during recent events, riots, wildfires, Covid issues I have been uncertain about what’s going on in the world.

Never knew what the USB port on my T.V.s were for until I read in the antenna directions, it can be used to power the Antenna. Had a different brand  digital antenna on one TV and could only get 20 channels. This one gives me 61 channels. Picture is great.

I purchased 1 of the HDTV Antenna because I was a little skeptical of how it would work. I was able to get 69 channels right away. I am able to watch shows that I can't even get on cable.

Secondly Scan in a few minutes and finally more channels than other antennas I have bought previously. As well no signal lost. Clear crispy view, I can go on and on. Not because I am interested in a free Antenna but it is true facts. 5 stars and beyond I absolutely recommend this to my Family and Friends. Thumbs up. Thank you and bye cable for ever and ever.",5,1,2020-5-12,1,0,1
"I bought from Amazon Thursday and received it on a Sunday. plugged it into our downstairs TV that basically has the worse reception.  We didnt even put the antenna close to a window because we wanted to see how good of a reception we would receive when it was basically at its worse possible position.We were totally amazed.  We got about 54 channels, we didnt scroll through all of them because we landed on a movie and started watching it.",5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"I am very happy! I went from 14 lame channels with bad reception to 23 lame channels with very good reception even on the 9 new lame channels... Get all the local news and content for free, some of them in HD! And the antenna I mounted it on a glass window with 2 suction cup hooks I had. oh,  and the cable is thin and easy to conceal...",5,1,2020-4-22,1,1,0
"I couldn't be more impressed!  I live across from Victoria BC in Port Angeles WA.  Needless to say, because of all the mountains,  it is next to impossible to get any over the air channels in this area.  But with this antenna, I get 14 channels.  It's very easy to set up and the quality of the channels I do get is amazing.  I'm so impressed!  I highly recommend this antenna.",5,1,2020-6-13,1,1,0
"So I researched TV antennas and thought this would be ideal. Open the box and it only came with a black side. I ordered this one because 1 it was supposed to get great a great signal, 2, it was supposed to have a black and white side. Basically you can buy an antenna at Walmart that gets the same type picture and the same channels. I contacted Amazon because I was hoping to be able to use the white side to put on my wall. Well there wasn’t a white side. Not to mention when I tried to pull up the product description the item was no longer available, nor could I get a description nor could Amazon find it either.  Now you pull up the item and all of a sudden they have 17 of them. I don’t even know if I got the one I was supposed to because there is no model number on the box. Definitely not a happy camper",2,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0
"The antenna Amazon Ad did not show the product was from umusthave. This company refused to honor its free antenna promotion so I would never buy another of it's products, even if it was a good one, which this antenna is not. This antenna is selling soley becuse previous products were ok so people think this one must also be good. It is not. People are not returning it because it is not worth it. They knew they'd sell enough of this cheap useless product to make money before the bad reviews started rolling in and it's cheap enough that most people would not bother to return it.After the shock I ended up with another umusthave product, like others, I figured it's not worth the efforrt to return it. So I tried it. I tried many many locations and orientations with no acceptable results.  I did get some channels but different ones and different quantity of channels minutes later without touching the antenna and also if moving it an inch.  Very very inconsitent poor reception.",1,1,2020-5-2,1,0,0
"Installed in a few minutes, increased my channel reception from 51 to 62 channels. clear sharp picture quality on my HD TV. I have been using this antenna for over a week and have had some bad weather which usually would affect my outdoor antenna reception but with this antenna that problem went away. I am very happy with my purchase.",5,1,2020-5-3,1,1,0
I truly enjoy the tv antenna that I bought on amazon. I was paying almost $285 a month for cable and now we get all the channels we were watching for a fraction of the cost. The antenna is hidden behind the tv so it’s not big and bulky and even in bad weather we still have those same channels coming through clearly. I’ve had it about a month and I think it’s one of the best decisions we’ve made regarding our TV!,5,1,2020-2-5,1,1,1
I had previously bought another brand of antenna and was very displeased at the reception.I hesitated to purchase this one but saw that it had great reviews on Amazon so I clicked on it and crossed my fingers.,5,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
"I bought two of these with the hopes of finally getting rid of my ridiculously high cable bill.  I can't believe I waited so many years to do this!  The picture quality is fantastic, and it was unbelievably easy to install.  Mind you, I live less than 2 miles from a broadcast tower, so that really helps.  I now get 66 crystal clear channels, absolutely free. Combine that with a subscription to a couple other services, and my bill has dropped by 80%.  Holy moly... I'm a happy camper!",5,1,2020-8-1,1,1,0
"I just recieved my antenna and got it all set up. First, this antenna is SO easy to set up. The foam stickers make things even better by eliminating the need for nails into the wall. This antenna picks up so many channels in my area. The quality is absolutely amazing, much better than our old cable service even! I would 100% recommend this antenna to friends, and already have actually!",5,1,2020-2-19,1,1,0
Unboxing the product and installing it was very simple. They also include a free USB adapter to an outlet if you need it. Those TVs have an extra USB ports and I was able to plug it right in there. After you auto scan for channels you get tons of channels and a lot of them are HD. This works great for me because I cut my cable and only kept Wi-Fi for my residence.,5,1,2020-2-26,1,1,1
It’s a great antenna ! The look of it is very simple and great looking . It was very easy to connect . I had to go on YouTube to figure where in settings to update the channels.Once I attached it to my window the picture quality is great. I get my local channels and it looks amazing . I saved a lot o for money by getting an antenna rather than getting cable from a provider .,5,1,2020-5-13,1,1,0
Easy to set up.  Took about 5min.  Says you get all kinds of channels and local channels up to 200 miles away well you don’t.  I live 30 miles from a news station and I don’t even get there channel.  I get Fox News and then some really homemade like shows and about 99 music channels.  They give you a card with the package for another one for free well it says to email them but they email you back and want you to do all kinds of stuff.  Oh my HDTV was opened and used before I got it.  None of the wires were wrapped up and the two sided tape to hold it on the wall already had someone else’s wall and paint on it.  Don’t waste your money on this  I looked at all the reviews and though it was good but it’s all a scam,1,1,2020-9-18,1,1,1
"I've tried a lot of different mounting options, and the only one that works requires this antenna to be on a window facing the majority of your broadcast directions, or outside, which it isn't rated for. I have a North and South facing window I tried this on, and I will gain/lose channels depending on which window I use. I am only 24 miles from dead center Columbus, OH, and I can't get the majority of channels like GRIT, COMET, etc. I also tried the long and short range options it has.",1,1,2020-7-29,1,0,0
"I had been missing the programming for my local PBS channel, even though I had installed a major antenna on the roof of my building a few years ago.  Thinking, “Why not spend the $30 and see if the Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna does anything?” I bought one on Amazon.When the HDTV Antenna got here a couple of days later, I was surprised at how simple the device was.  It took less than 10 minutes to read the installation instruction manual and set it up.  I was a little disappointed that it could only serve one television in my house, but it DID bring in the local channels I was missing plus fifty more on that device.  The additional bonus was that the antenna lies flat and discreet on the side of a bookcase (held by three 3M command strips) and still grabs stations without my obscuring a window.",4,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"Had a cable outage last week for over a full day and we had no internet and no television.  We decided to try a antenna to get whatever local HDTV stations were available, so that we never have a complete TV outage again.We checked Amazon HDTV reviews and picked your product:",5,1,2020-1-28,1,1,0
I am very happy with my purchase of the extra HDTV antenna. Normally my husband and I have challenges with setting up new technology but this was a complete and utter breeze. Not to mention the fact that we’ve canceled cable and now we have pretty much all the channels that we really wanted to begin with for one time fee which was completely affordable. I’ve been telling all my friends and family about this and my sister purchased one too recently and seems to be very happy with hers.,5,1,2020-5-4,1,1,0
"I was skeptical of this antenna because of the distance to the stations I wanted to receive. I live in a small midwest city in a single story house with a crawlspace attic, mostly flat terrain with no forests to speak of. TV is a TCL with Roku, mounted on the wall in the living room with a 8' ceiling. My gut said go with a big powerful outdoor antenna. But I've been reading that indoor powered antennas are better now. So with all that being said, if you're not in a big city where TV stations broadcast, you need to try harder to get TV reception. You're probably patient or at least willing to experiment a bit. If so this could be the antenna for you. For starters, the first 3 attempts were disappointing. We have a PBS broadcast in our city. ABC, CBS, Fox & NBC transmitters are all 45-50 miles away. I knew I'd need to use the amp. After installing, I tried near the TV twice and the 3rd time in the window. Nothing besides the 3 channels from the local PBS station. Before getting upset, I tried dangling it out the window and I was able to get a couple more stations. Ok. Next, I moved it to on top of the roof and I was able to get all the stations I was hoping to except NBC which is a VHS channel. Cool!  But I wasn't going to leave it on the roof. Then, I ended up drilling a hole into the garage from the living room and moving the antenna into the attic. Same result. 3 out of 4 networks. I emailed support and they were quick to respond. They said reset the preamp and then scan again, it will enable VHS. I couldn't believe it but it actually worked!!! So why no 5 stars? Well, some evenings I can't get all of the channels. It seems weather related. Breezy & stormy evenings affect signal. Tonight is warm, clear & calm and I've got 3-5 bars, receiving 23 stations. The 4 big networks & 2 PBS with all their sub channels plus an independent station. So before football season, I may have to get an outdoor antenna, as I wouldn't host a party trusting this antenna. I like the price, I like the optional USB amp, I like the long coax cable, and support seems good. The inconsistency is my biggest gripe. Pro tips: Know your directions and/or use a compass app. Also, the amp itself affects signal. After installation, I hid it behind the TV and lost some reception. When I let it dangle, all the stations came back. Quirky af. Lastly consider a mount once you find the antenna's happy place. Any slight movement could eff up your reception.",4,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
"I doubted this would work on a TV about 20 miles out of town.  Hung the antenna on the wall, plugged the antenna into the amp, plugged the ac adapter into the amp, and plugged the amp into the TV.  5 minute setup at most.  30 channels from Lubbock, Texas!!  WOW.  and the picture quality is great.  I'm buying one for the RV now.",5,1,2020-6-11,1,1,0
"So easy to set up. Took less than one minute. The picture is clear and I get around thirty channels. I bought one a year or so ago for my tv in my kitchen. This upgraded, newer edition one, I just bought and installed is for the large tv in my living room. My son thought I had signed up for Spectrum Cable it is so clear. Thank you! If I can set it up at age 65, anyone can.😁",5,1,2020-9-10,1,1,1
"We have finally decided to cut the cord this year.  We were a bit hesitant because we have been use to having live television in our daily lives.  After doing some research, we came across this HDTV antenna.  The range it offered and clear quality and price, it sounded too good to be true.  After the easy installation and channel scan, we were able to get more over the air channels than we would have expected.  The quality was crystal clear.  The signal was exceptional.  This antenna exceeded our expectations. We definitely recommend anyone looking to cut the cord and getting a HDTV antenna to consider this one.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
I live in a rural area outside of Eugene Oregon. I have a guest house on the property that has no cable or satellite. I have been using an RCA HDTV antenna for years in the guest house and only receive 6 stations. 2 of those stations always seem to have reception issues.I decided to try this (U Must Have) antenna because of all the good reviews on Amazon. I just installed it today and it works terrific! I now receive 9 channels and all of them have great reception!,5,1,2019-11-30,1,1,0
"Was not sure this was going to work for me, but wow wish I had purchased it sooner!! Easy to set up. My tv scanned for all channels available was like 144 listed. The major channels 2,4,5,7,9,11,&13 the picture is great!  There are lots of other channels, foreign language channels so happy I purchased I’m ready at last to cut the cord!",5,1,2020-4-21,1,1,0
This was definitely not what I expected.  It is extremely lightweight and pretty much all in one solution.  My only complaint is that the cable wasn't quite long enough for what I needed but that's easily addressed.  I wasn't able to get all of my local channels but I got many more than what I was able to get with my old antenna.  Note: my best reception was when the antenna was sitting in the window.,5,1,2020-9-3,1,1,0
"We used this antenna on our smart tv and are very pleased. It was easy to install, easy to set up, great price point. We actually get more channels with this hdtv antenna than we did our old antenna. Picture is clear. Channels come in better than before. It comes with stickies to have the option of sticking to the wall, which in our case provides better reception. Than it laying on the tv center. It also comes with a very long cord for convenience.",5,1,2020-3-29,1,1,0
"With rabbit ear antennas I was picking up around 35 channels, but with this I’m getting about 55 channels, so that’s impressive. It’s definitely worth it.I haven’t fully installed it yet, because I’m waiting to make sure I have it where I want it. Different places around the house will give you better or worse reception. Right now it’s hanging on my blinds.",5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,1
I just have to say how great this antenna is. I have tried others in the past that did not live up to the hype but this one is fantastic. First I set it up lying flat on the table and I got over 45 channels. My local 10 had a week signal soI set it up in the window next and it picked up over 80 with multiple channel 10s. I have since attached it to a Fire TV recast and I have a great channel guide and DVR ability on every fire enabled TV in my house. I had no idea there were so many channels out there for free. This is a great antenna for over the air HDTV.,5,1,2020-2-13,1,1,0
Today I received my HDTV Antenna and with in 5 minutes of opening the box I had it set up and ready to go.I took the antenna out of the box attached the amplifier. Next I found the antenna port on the back of the tv and connected it. Next I plugged in the amplifier. Then I found the settings on my tv and had it search for channels. After the tv completed 2 searches I had all the channels I expected and more. I found it easy and straightforward to set up Andrew  now my son is enjoying PBS. Thanks for making it easy to access traditional Tv channels.,5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,1
"I received my new antenna today. I hooked it quickly with no tools. I carried a small tv through the house to see where I could get reception. I was able to get reception in 4 different rooms. I was able to get more stations than with an antenna I had ordered with a shorter milage range. I could get PBS, CBS, NBC,  and ABC. I could also get a lot of smaller stations. I could not get ABC with the other antenna. This had a clear picture. I wish it worked just every where, but I think 4 rooms is pretty good. Overall, I am very pleased with it, and plan to keep it. I live about 30 miles from Houston.",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"I have a smart tv attached to cable, but I like to have an over the air backup.  The ""rabbit ears"" amplified antenna that I was using was only getting me 13 to 18 channels with lots of pixel issues.Everything I needed was in the box.  I unhooked my other antenna, hooked this one on, plugged it in, put it in my window temporarily to test (I know where the towers are). Got 40 channels (only a few have pixel issues, but I knew they would from visiting the channel map, as suggested, before I bought the antenna. I then went ahead and taped it in the window and re-ran the channel search, getting the same 40.",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,1
"I live in the country, I was replacing a indoor antenna and amplifier with a 60 mile radius that I thought was weak for picking up stations. This antenna I bought thinking it was going to stronger and pick up better reception and more channels proved me wrong, no matter what window I put it in I received less stations. Not worth the money or time in my book.",1,1,2020-4-29,1,1,0
I have to say that I was VERY skeptical about this Amplified HD Antenna but wow was I wrong.  The picture quality after the somewhat easy 10 minute install is really quite amazing!  I can honestly say that the cable picture I HAD (should have cut thecord a long time ago) is NO different then the antenna quality.  Bought this antenna just to get my local news channel but now get 21 dts & 138 cable channels all with a great picture.  So now I have this antenna and the Amazon Stick and I can see pretty much everything I want at the fraction of the cost!.  Very happy with this antenna and would definitely recommend to anyone.,4,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0
"I’ve had my HDTV antenna for 6 months now. No problems with it. We don’t get a lot of channels, but I think that is just because of our location.

"i purchased this product for my mom who is a nursing home. the cable they offered was dismally blurry and at $25 a month, i thought perhaps something over the air might be better suited to her needs. the one word that comes to mind concerning this antenna is - fantastic. she now does not need to juggle two remotes, one for the tv and one for the cable box, and the station clarity is phenomenal. her tv has never looked so clear. setup was effortless. making a few adjustments in the placement gave her upwards of 60 channels. we whittled this down to her 25 favorites and she could not be happier.",5,1,2020-2-23,1,1,0
Absolutely love these antennas. Moved to new home and wanted to cut the cable bill completely. Purchased two of these and they work great. Wish i'd did it years ago. Picture quality is great. Have to retune channels sometimes but no big deal. Easy to assemble and installl. Recommended to my neighbor and he bought one as well after seeing my tv picture quality. Definitely would recommend if you're tired of paying expensive cable and satellite providers.,5,1,2020-4-9,1,1,0
I absolutely love this antenna. It was more than I expected. I live out in county surrounded by woods and had no idea it work this good. I also live 45 miles or more from any tv stations. This antenna even picked up a couple of channels close to 100 miles away. I have had other antennas and by far this is the best ever. It is so thin when the box arrived I didn't think anything was in it. I moved the antenna this morning closer to a window and now have more channels. Great antenna! Best buy! Works great! and easy to install your 5 year old child could do it. I would recommend this antenna for everyone.,5,1,2020-1-16,1,2,0
"I bought this antenna with some skepticism as I'm 50 miles or more aware from any stations I'd want to pick up.  Just hung this on an inside wall and using my old Silicon Dust network tuner was able to pick up 52 channels.  Picture quality is obviously great for most stations.  Some additional channels could be detected, but their signal was too weak to receive.  I also ended up splitting the feed from this antenna into both ports of the Silicon Dust tuner and the stations still all came in great.",5,1,2020-3-16,1,1,0
"I currently stream all of my television programs via the internet.  However, the reason I purchased the antenna several months ago was because I continually lost and continue to lose my WIFI connection intermittently. As a result, my television programming was inconsistant at best.  The HDTV Antenna has been a saving grace in that area.  Many times, I use only the antenna as I have access to all of the major networks without the use of cable or WIFI.  It has been and continues to be a stress reliever.  The antenna was a great purchase choice and I would advise everyone to get one.  If for no other reason, as a backup.",5,1,2020-6-14,1,1,0
"The product arrived fast and it was very easy to set up. The included signal booster connected to my Sony TV's USB port and the coaxial video connection.

With this antennae, the HD picture is extremely sharp and the sound is excellent ! I am very pleased with this slim and unobtrusive antennae. It was an excellent value!",5,1,2019-11-11,1,1,1

We live far from a transmitting tower. We have been unable to find an antenna that works. We missed out on years of local football games. We were not sure this would work. IT DID!! It didn’t just work but we got a total of 19 stations! All with clear pictures and sound. We are so happy with this product! Installation was easy! The antenna is aesthetically pleasing. Total time to set up and be fully functional was 20 minutes. Very very happy with this product.,5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,1
"I just received my HDTV antenna last week.Installation was easy and scanning for channels was great. Without placing the antenna facing the towers, which are 30 miles away, I was able to find 153 HD channels. We just cut our cable last week, since we stream most of what we watch but we wanted our live local channels for news and to see new episodes of our favorite shows. I would only have liked maybe another few feet of cable length in order to get the cable behind furniture more easily.",4,1,2020-4-6,1,1,0
"Have had comcast  forever, wife said no dish on house, uverse not available in our area. Have dealt with dtas (could not use 80% of $2000 tv  features) and slowly increasing fees. I am a basic needs guy and only need the very basic. Then comcast adds  $10 fee to  only the very basic plans, only $5 more to go up level to  get more channels I don't need or watch. Not for me. Son talked us in to hulu  live with his account, did not realize have to check in with his home network monthly, can't do. Bought your anntena, am getting not only more channels, but more of the ones we willwatch. Had another indoor antenna in a higher room only get 15 channels unlike the over 60 with your antenna.

I recently purchased your digital 2020 antenna and currently have nothing but good things to say. There is very little to no lag ever with a clear picture. My only advice would be to work how it is mounted to a wall or window not a big fan of the double sided stick. I don’t want to put it on my wall or window due to fear of it leaving a mark. I feel that a suction cup idea could be much more useful for easy window hanging and can be taken down after with no Marks someone like me would only want it on the window when I’m using it and currently with the double stick that is not an option. I would still include in box for people who want a permanent wall mount but not ideal for windows.,5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0

Works great for a indoor TV antenna. I bought a cheap Walmart rabbit ear from walmart and returned it. For the same price this anntena picked up more channel and provided solid picture.

"I bought three of these hoping the would do the trick...... They did not disappoint!  At the worst placing I got 51 channels, and 58 at the best. That might not seem like much for some of you, but my old antenna got 16 (I bought early into the HD digital antennae movement). The only “ improvement” I would recommend is about application instructions. The white side should be stuck to the surface you’re trying to face towards. Other than that.... it’s an amazing product!

"I recently made the decision to “unplug” from my constantly increasing cable service. After replacing a few of my old flat screens with smart TV’s, it was time to try an HDTV antenna on one of them to test the waters before purchasing for the rest of the TV’s. I first tried a higher priced named brand antenna from a big box store. I had limited success with this unless I constantly moved it around to just get a partial signal. My wife saw the “U MUST HAVE” Ultra-Thin HDTV Antenna on Amazon Prime and decided to give it a shot. After a quick set up and scan, I immediately received numerous strong channel signals without even the need for repositioning the antenna over and over again.

I ordered the HDTV Antenna through amazon and I received it today 5/16/2020. I automatically opened the box and hooked it to my television. My parents are so happy and are loving the system they keep thanking me and saying how grateful they are that there is options like this and how clear and professional the hdtv antenna looks on the tv. Thank you for a the quick delivery and making an easy and good tv system that even the elderly can use.,5,1,2020-5-17,1,2,0
We just moved into a new house and our old antenna that we used for so many years nationwide did not work because the house next door was blocking the signal. I Decided to research for a new antenna and I'm so glad I did. This antenna was completely AMAZING! I didn't even have to play around with it to find a signal. It worked right away and we received so many channels with out any signal interruption. The pricing was fair and the shipment was quick! I'm 100% satisfied.,5,1,2020-9-11,1,0,0
"Genuinely was surprised at the strength of this antenna, in my area which is South Florida, I was able to pick up 56 channels and that was not placing it in the window but just right behind the tv on the wall.  It's funny too because when you pull it out of the package, it feels so flimsy, truth is , it looks cheap AF but the results are quite impressive.",5,1,2020-4-10,1,1,0
"I needed an HDTV antenna for one of my Vizio 2015 TVs. I did my research, and I found this one to have decent and above reviews. This antenna was easy to install, and it has worked great so far. I am very happy with this antenna. I would recommend it to others looking to get the basic and a few more channels. I was able to get around 30 channels.",5,1,2020-2-25,1,1,0
I’m trying to save money so I decided to get rid of my cable and go with an antenna. I was a little hesitant because I remember as a kid having an antenna and only having about three channels. But to my surprise I have about 17 channels and the picture is really clear. The installation was super easy. I’m really happy with my purchase and I’m glad to have freed up about 100 bucks from getting rid of my cable.Update: I actually have 30 channels!,5,1,2020-2-16,1,1,0
"Instructions are super clear shown in images with description, easy to assemble it. Even double-sided sticky pads are included to attach the antenna to a flat surface. Installed it with Amazon's recast box, scanned for new channels, and got 61 of them! The antenna works very well, with no dropped frames, image, and sound very stable. I like it!",5,1,2020-2-27,1,1,0
"I was impressed in how easy to set up for me, How the colors were more vibrant on my tv.  I was and am disappointed that it might say 200 mile radius.  It picks up nothing  even close to that...200 mile range.",5,1,2020-7-27,1,2,0
"Hello!  I am so excited about my new Amplified Digital HDTV Angenna!I had purchased an RCA antenna, and I couldn't get it to work.  It was extremely frustrating.  I even made a second purchase thinking the first was a defect, but the installation proved futile.  I was so upset.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
"I recently got rid of cable and needed an antenna with good range and this one was super easy to install and get setup. It has a super long cable in case your window is far (which mine isn't but still good to have in case I rearrange furniture)I got about 60 channels and it's working so good, especially for a good price.",5,1,2020-3-17,1,1,0
"Updated: Changed to 1 star. I had to rescan channels sometimes 10 times a day to get the one I want. As it stands, I cannot get any local channels. If it’s raining or cloudy this is as crappy as dish network. I use the firestick now.This was very easy to install. I did have to move the antenna a couple times and rescan the channels but I get all the local channels now. I was able to cancel my monthly subscription with dish network; a savings of at least $120 a year. I would definitely recommend this antenna.",1,1,2019-12-13,1,1,0
"I recently purchased one of your antennas from Amazon and am very happy I did. We recently got rid of cable and opted for internet only, but I wasn't able to get many of my local channels that I normally watch. I thought I'd give this a try, and it's been great so far. The reception is usually perfect with a clear picture. I plan on getting more for my other tv's.",5,1,2020-3-14,1,1,0
"I purchased item to replace another antenna that I was not happy with. This product exceeded my expectations. Setup was easy. The picture is very clear with placement in window and on 1st scan. I did not try to use away from window since that is where I wanted the placement.  I did not need to adhere it high on the window, just leaned it up against on window seal in livingroom. Picture does not distort when you move around the room.  I am very happy with this product.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,1
"I bought this antenna about a week ago. I have nothing but good things to say about this HDTV antenna. First of all, I get 90 plus clear and stable channels with all my favorite shows including news channels. It was easy to install and the images are of good quality. I am very happy with this product. Thank you",5,1,2020-6-18,1,1,1
"This Antenna was so easy to hook up. It literally took only minutes. It also was very simple to find the perfect spot for it to pick up all the tv stations available to me in my area. I live in a very bad area for reception, (mountains all around me) I've tried other antenna's that just would not work in my area, but this antenna did the job. It easily picked up stations that lesser antenna's  just couldn't do. I'm very happy, and glad I purchased this antenna.",5,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"The indoor tv antennas I have purchased in the past might have worked for 50 miles, if that.  I was skeptical, but once hooked up, I got multiple channels an picture perfect.  Easy set up and use.  I tested this out and will take to our 82 year old Aunt in Chicago.  She will move from the “rabbit ears” age to the digital one.  She previously received 8 stations.  I look forward to finding more with her new antenna.One of the best electronic buys on Amazon.  Enjoy!",5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"I am very pleased with my purchase and I thought it wouldn't catch as many local channels as it does. It was a very easy set-up and I was able to hide the antenna in the back of my TV. I do not want to throw away my money on getting cable and I mainly bought this antenna to catch local news stations. I am glad now I can watch live local news. Before, without the antenna, my local channels would sometimes work and other times not work- it was very frustrating. Overall, I am satisfied with it!",5,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0

First place I put it - got all the channels with clear pictures and good signal reception!",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"I am glad to share my experience with this Gesobyte HDTV Antenna.This was ordered for a smaller township in central CA (not LA or SF or Bay Area) but am so glad that I invested in this Antenna. With the expenses associated with multiple streaming services becoming a heavy-lifting for my wallet, this option of getting over the air service by using antenna was God-sent!",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
"I purchased the Gesobyte HDTV antenna and I was amazed with the amount of TV channels I was able to receive and how easy it was to set it up. I was able to get the same amount of channels and quality without even having to use the signal booster that is provided, but good to know that it is there if I needed it. Definitely follow the instructions provided for best success. I will save some much money not spending it on cable TV now that I have the main broadcast channels and extra HD channels. Thank you so much for this amazing antenna!",5,1,2020-2-11,1,1,0
"I ordered and installed one of your antennas as a back up when our cable connection fails due to bad weather or for many other 'unknown' causes.I did not have much hope of success with an 'over the air device' because the only location in which it could be installed was very limited. The only location was between two brick walls only five feet apart, much like sighting down a rifle barrel.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,1,0

"I looked around for a decent antenna. One that wasnt bulky or expensive. Came across this one, the price was too good to be true. Best antenna Ive have ever purchased.

"Hello everyone, I have been searching for an hdtv antenna because I don’t have cable and my current antenna only picks up limited channels. After reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to try the u must have digital hdtv antenna.  I am so thrilled that I am now able to look at least 87 additional channels. I had purchased a big Screen tv last year and the antenna I was using would not allow me to enjoy my new tv. It would not pick up the basic local channels. I could only look at channels by using a streaming Device. But now with my new digital HDTV, I can turn the Tv on and look at local TV channels.  This was the best investment for my tv. AND  it was extremely easy to install. Thank you very much. The picture quality is great. It does not freeze nor does it lose the signal.P. B.",5,1,2020-2-4,1,1,1
"I previously had an outdoor antenna that worked well for several years until the signal booster box died. I ordered what I thought was an identical antenna , but the reception on this one was terrible and the signal booster box fried after 3 months. The company would not offer any kind of replacement , so money wasted. The reviews on this antenna were good so I ordered one. I was sceptical that an indoor antenna would have good reception , but I am now able to watch all my channels again, plus this one was much easier to install them the previous antenna I had ; no getting up on a roof! I wish I had ordered it sooner.",5,1,2020-4-8,1,1,0
"I was slowly losing channels on my new Samsung TV. I thought the TV I purchased was a lemon I was down to just receiving 4 channels. I never thought the problem with the tv could be the antenna, because the antenna that I had wasnt that old. I thought let me get a new antenna before I give up on the TV. I bought this one and It was very easy to set up and everything was included even the mounting stickers. What I liked best was the 18 ft coaxial cable and it's white on one side black on the other to better match your walls. After I hooked up the antenna and did a channel scan I was surprised when I got 58 channels. I realize the amount of channels you will get is based on the distance from the towers, but I went from 4 channels to 58 channels. I never had that many,, I love this antenna!",5,1,2020-6-18,1,0,1
"Great Picture! Configure your TV for input of TV Air, like directions say.  I will be adding another to my living room.  I ordered one for a friend and also hooked hers up today and she loves it! It really makes a difference in peoples lives when they suddenly can relax and take their mind off issues in a nice space they have where they could not afford a cable box.  I liked that the TV antenna has an 18' cable! If it had an even longer one I would add one to my kitchen. Since I have cut the cable I have not had local news. I am in Florida where we have some serious storms you need to have local news for your area to be prepared. So it's not only fun but can be a life saver.",5,1,2020-4-4,1,1,0
I just received the HDTV antenna that I purchased on Amazon.  I'm trying hard to cut the cord from Cable TV that has been soaking me for  nearly $200 a month.  At this crazy time it is imperative to cut costs.  I was impressed to see how easy the antenna was to set up and was impressed to see the picture come in so clearly.  We were having a spring snow storm so I wasn't sure what to expect from it under the circumstances.  I think I will be able to adjust to having fewer channels and streaming some content even at my ripe old age where all of this is relatively new.  I grew up with rabbit ears on our black and white TV.  this is a huge upgrade!!!scanned once and i got 32 channels.,4,1,2020-3-24,1,1,0
We received our Gesobyte Amplified HD Digital Antenna Long 200+ miles range this morning. Installation was a breeze and I preceded to settting up the channels. We previously were only able to receive 32 channels and their signal was disrupted when the commuter rail train went by the house. We can now get 46 channels and no signal interruptions. Awesome product!,5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
"This HD antenna was very easy to install, and works great even on an older tv.  On the first try, I got 58 channels.  All of the major channels come in crystal clear. I live in the city, and have found with other antennas that there is too much interference – not with this one.  I did try clicking it to long range to experiment, but I got fewer channels.  It is pretty inobtrusive for an interior antenna, which is nice. I would definitely recommend it.  The one change I’d make to the instructions is to recommend during installation to use 1 of the supplied mounting stickers – I had no way to hold it up to find the best spot without them (though alternatively a loop of masking tape would have worked short term as well).",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"This is by far the best antenna I've purchased on amazon. This was the third antenna I've tried and this will be the last!The 2 prior purchases were more expensive and both received far fewer channels. I was having a hard time receiving even major networks like CBS and ABC (yikes). This product however has been amazing. It went from 5 channels to more than 35 in my area, all crystal clear (HD). Thank you for this amazing product!",5,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0
"Just wanted to drop you a line to say how great your Amplified Digital Indoor HDTV Antenna is.  I just hooked it up to my new Smart TV and it pulls in easily all the local stations I could not receive, even through my BIG antenna I have in the attic :).  Amazing device.  I disconnected my big antenna and replaced it with this and the TV signals are better and clearer than ever.",5,1,2020-2-17,1,1,0

"The packaging was well received. Liked that it was all neatly bound and put in to a Ziploc style bag.There was really no setup involved, however the instructions were easily understood. I would update the pictures to include the logo so you can identify which side should be facing towards the/wall window and which one should be facing forward, Or identify “front” and “back’ with removable decals.. Upon completion of the setup and scan it picked up over 80 channels and most of them had good to a very good signal strength rating.",5,1,2020-6-15,1,1,0
"I was only able to pull in a few channels with a non-amplified antenna and they did not come in very well.  Once I hooked up my GB AMplified HD Digital TV Antenna which was so simple to set up, I was able to get 20+ channels and most were HD quality.  Very pleased.  Now I need another amplified antenna for the bedroom!",5,1,2020-6-19,1,1,0
This HD antenna arrived in two days and was extremely easy to install. Coax cable into the TV and the USB power supply into the wall outlet. I placed the antenna behind the TV which is located on an interior wall. Set the TV input to antenna abd tuned the TV using auto program. In only a matter of minutes the TV located and programmed over 20 local over the air channels available in my area. Many of these are HD quality and they rival and even beat the quality of the same channels on satellite and cable.,5,1,2020-7-21,1,1,0
I was pleasantly surprised with the performance of this antenna. I tried it on a tv on ground level and received about 14 channels and then went to the second floor of my home and received 57 channels and I'm about 30 miles away or more from many of the stations and the only window I have is facing north and all the stations are south! Very impressive.,5,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0
"So i had a normal digital antenna for my 55"" 4K HDTV and i pretty much didn't get any local channels.  After i installed this antenna and re-searched for local channels, i got every channel available, even ones i didn't know existed, and they all come in clear as crystal.  For the price, this did exactly what it advertised it'd do, i'd buy another if i need one, but for now, ones enough. ::)",5,1,2019-11-15,1,1,0
"Finally cancelled by DirectTv - set this up in about 5 minutes and picture quality is perfect.  I am in a major city so I get a ton of channels. The only thing to get used to with this is that there is no guide, you need to look up the TV channels in your region. But it's saving me a ton of money and anything else I want I view on Amazon or Netflix. Recommend!",5,1,2020-5-20,1,1,0
I purchased this product very skeptical about its ability to pick up additional signals.I’ve tried many different antennas in the past and gotten decent results but did not believe that the technology had gotten any better. Especially the claim of finding new channels but I gave it a try. I was able to hook up the HD antenna very easily and to place it in different positions in the room. After my very first attempt I was able to pick up 4 additional channels that I had never seen before with my older antenna. I then changed the setting from short range to long range. To my pleasant surprise I picked up an additional 18 channels with clarity. I highly recommend this antenna to anyone who enjoys free TV!,5,1,2020-6-9,1,1,0
"I have purchased HD antenna's before, and returned them.  They just never worked like they said they would.  I needed one for my RV, as the crank-style ones just don't work any longer.  So, with hesitation I ordered this one.  I have to say - it's fantastic!  So easy to install and it was up and running within 5 minutes!  After a channel scan we were watching 19 channels (in a valley area where there is hardly any reception).  I'm thrilled with this product!",5,1,2020-7-9,1,1,0
I've got a mixed review on this product as the TV that I initially installed it on did not have great reception.  The picture and sound came through for about 3 minutes with perfect clarity.  Then I lost the signal.  I've moved the antenna to a 2nd window on the opposite side and had even worse reception.  The set-up was easy and instructions were clear.  I'm going to move this to a different TV in the house and see if I have better reception in a different location.,3,1,2020-2-4,1,1,0
i purchase an antenna at my local wallmart and the cost was 3 time the cost of this antenna.  My wife wanted to set up the antenna and she follow the steps and had the antenna set up in less than 5 minutes (3 mins were the tv looking for the channels) and we were watching tv in no time.  the antenna picked up more channels than the 100 dollar antenna and the picture its more crisp and clear.,5,1,2020-2-11,1,1,0
"It is important to do you research before purchasing an indoor antenna to understand where the towers are in respect to your home so that you know how many miles you are trying to pull a signal from.  It is also important to understand that every house it different and it will take some patience to determine the perfect spot in your home for your antenna.  I was amazed to see the number of channels more I could receive after moving the antenna a few feet over and higher to the ceiling!  Once you do you research for how far away you are from the towers, then I would recommend getting an amplified antenna so that you have the option to use it amplified or not.  Also, this antenna was great in that it has a USB wall plug in case you are already utilizing all the open USB ports on your TV.  The instructions are very easy to follow for set-up.  Do remember that after each re-positioning of the antenna you will need to re-search for the channels.  Again all these instructions are clearly outlined in the manual and even some of the less-techy folks (such as myself) should have minimal issues installing the antenna.  I am so happy to start saving over $1,000/year by getting rid of the poor quality Spectrum cable!  This antenna is streaming in some of the local channels in higher resolution than cable as well!  This antenna is a great deal there is no need to be overwhelmed with trying to understand what is involved in cutting cable.  Simply: (1) Purchase this antenna - it has a 120 mile radius to towers which is on the higher end of distance offered, (2) Follow the simple instructions to install the antenna (have patience while you determine the best location in your house and remember a couple of feet make a huge distance), and (3) Call the cable company and tell them you will no longer be spending $1,000 a year on poor quality cable.  Enjoy!",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"This antenna is amazing!  It was super easy to install (literally plug in USB and connect antenna cable).  The cord is very thin and long enough to reach 18 feet. The antenna is thin and flexible and comes with double sided tape to adhere it to a window. I get the big 4 major networks, and a bunch of other channels.  The HD picture quality is absolutely perfect.  I paid double the price previously for an antenna that couldn’t pick up all of the major channels and only had a 10 foot cord.  This antenna is great value for a superior product!",5,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0

"Every purchase begins with research! I had read through several products before deciding upon this product. I wasn't disappointed.

Most are in clear and sharp defines pictures. This a great product.",5,1,2019-12-2,1,1,0
I am very impressed with this HDTV antenna.The set up was incredibly easy and I was able to access many stations immediately without really taking the time to find the best location and permanently mount. I am so happy to finally give the cable company a call to say I am returning their cable box! This also would be great to use in our RV and finally have more than two stations to watch. The garage would be another great place to use the antenna. Thanks for a great device!,5,1,2020-6-9,1,2,0
We are traveling in an RV and their parks are notorious for poor reception.

Based on the ratings I purchased the latest 2020 Amplified HD antenna and it appears that my problems are a thing of the past.  I have it posted in a bedroom window and it works great! Make sure you try several positions on your  window and run a quick over-air channel scans.  Movement of just a few inches increases the number of channels you will receive.",5,1,2020-7-25,1,1,0

I’m not able to get the Boston stations since I live in the pioneer valley and there are hills between my home and Boston. I get 8 channels altogether from the Springfield area and the reception for these is excellent. Unfortunately I don’t get CBS which airs the Patriots games. I’m a big fan!Given the difficulties of my area, I am quite satisfied with your product.",4,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0

When I plugged it back in I noticed a brown light glowing from the from the cord. I saw there was a switch, and flipped it. The light turned green so I decided to rescan. Boom, over fifty channels. Sad I wasted time (probably was in the instructions), but glad I didn't waste money. If it isn't working out how you'd like, try the switch.",5,1,2020-9-4,1,1,0

This one reaches up to 200 miles, and is the best one I've had so far. With this one, I never have to adjust or move it to pick up certain channels, and the picture never freezes on me. Practically never. Very clear picture. I wish all the digital antennas could be hidden from view, but if I'm going to use one, this is the best one I've had by performance.

This doesn’t even pick up channels that my $10.00 ones - I have two - clearly do. I wanted to pick up some others. The advertising is false. Greatly exaggerated.,1,1,2020-4-29,1,2,0
"We were looking for a less expensive way to watch TV in a bedroom and our kitchen because we only use them for local stations.  We previously were renting a cable box for $12.00 a month each! We chose the HGTV Simple Antenna because of the positive reviews, reasonable cost and promise of easy installation.  We live 100 miles away from our Green Bay, Wisconsin stations. Now we wonder why we didn't do this sooner. Everyone of our expectations have been meet. Very pleased.",5,1,2019-12-2,1,2,0
"This antenna is the best that I've ever had. With other antenna's I could only get about 9 stations, with this one, I could get around 40-46 depending on the weather.  I work in a metal building and bet if you were in a regular brick and mortar environment, that you could probably get more channels.  It was so easy to install.  I just stuck it on the window, scanned the tv and wallah had channels that I've never had before.  I highly recommend this antenna!!  Thanks for making such a great product.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
I purchased this antenna so that I could stop paying exorbitant rates to DIRECTV.  The antenna was easy to install and was able to get all of the local channels in the area.  The high-definition picture is beautiful.  Thank you for making my transition from cable to streaming an easy one.!,5,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0
"We finally cut all cable cords completely. We were paying for basic tv with Comcast because it was $10 extra a month with our internet plan. But what i didn’t know was all the added fees ($30!!! Don’t believe me look at your broadcast fee, sport fee, tv franchise fee, etc) for watching less than 12 channels. I purchased this HD antenna and get so many channels with crystal clear picture! I am so happy with this purchase and the amount of money I will be saving from fees with cable companies.",5,1,2020-3-26,1,1,0
"This product is amazing.  I live on a ground floor unit of an apartment complex and where my unit sits doesn’t get very good reception with any other antenna’s I’ve had.  I decided to try this one as the reviews were very good but I wasn’t going to get my hopes up given the experience I had with previous antenna’s.  This was very easy to setup and once I scanned for channels, I have WAY MORE channels than I did before.  The picture comes out so clear and it doesn’t cut in and out.  I am very happy with this one and I highly recommend this product.",5,1,2020-4-27,1,1,0
"I have been using the indoor HDTV antenna for about a month now and it is fantastic. All of my local stations come through in true high definition and, if the signals are weak, there are standard def channels as an option (but really difficult to watch on a large screen tv!). I have coupled my antenna with an Amazon Recast box, so can record two different channels at a time and skip ads. After the initial outlay for the pieces, my TV viewing  is free, free, free!",5,1,2020-5-17,1,0,1
"First in order for these antennas to work(even the cheapest ones) you need to have a clear line of sight of broadcasting antenna, even if you can't visually see it, you will have to have your antenna facing that direction. But if you live around high hills or down in a hollow, and the hills block broadcasting antenna, you won't pick up a thing , no matter how expensive or how many miles it claims to pick up signals. In that case you will need satellite or cable or wifi type service and pay for reception and internet stuff.",5,1,2020-5-4,1,1,0
"After recently cutting the cord on cable, I purchased this product after seeing its great reviews.  Not only was it easy to attach (both to my TV and go the wall), but I was pleasantly surprised by its light weight and small size which easily mounts (and holds) with a simple adhesive strip rather than screws. Given this small size, I was especially surprised to find that it is able to pick up 30 over-the-air channels where I live, even without using the inline amplifier included with the antenna. I’m very satisfied with this purchase.",5,1,2020-6-27,1,1,0
"This may be the best product I have ever bought from Amazon! I live in the country south of Corpus Christi, Texas. Take 2 mins to put up and plug into the tv. I now pick up 21 channels from Corpus Christi. All broadcast networks, me tv, Laff, tv and more. The broadcast stations are all in HD. Clean crisp picture on all channels . Thank you for a product that truly lives up to its hype. I will buy another one and put up . 10 Stars .",5,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0
"We bought an HDTV antenna recently, and we found it really easy to use. It gave us the ability to watch local channels without any hassle. It was a good value for our money as well. We are about 50 miles from NYC and we are still getting a good signal. The only negative is that it took a while to place the antenna in the right position, so it would get a good signal. But overall, we like this product very much and will recommend it to our friends and family!",5,1,2019-11-8,1,2,0
"We purchased the HDTV antenna through Amazon because we are trying to cut the cable!When we first hooked it up we used the amplifier, assuming, of course you will need it, and we weren’t getting anything until we took that off.",5,1,2020-5-23,1,1,0
Excellent upgrade over my previous OTA antenna. The range is fantastic and the added length of the coaxial cable is a definite bonus as you can place it anywhere to improve reception if needed. The channels are crisp and clear with no background hiss or interference. The company also included double sided tape. Quality construction and quick delivery. Would recommend to anyone needing an OTA antenna to supplement a cable installation or just drop cable altogether. Be sure to check your local area first for broadcast channels to see if you are located in an saturated with signals from tv providers.,5,1,2020-4-3,1,1,0
Antenna was easy to install.  Seems to work great.  Hopefully that will be the end of weak signals.But.... the warranty activation and fee antenna offer .... both by email..... is cheesy.  Fingers crossed I won't need the former and life goes on without the latter.,5,1,2020-6-29,1,1,0
"I live out in the country or “off the grid” as my family calls it. We can’t get WiFi and signal is usually bad, especially when it storms. I purchased this and it has made a world of difference compared to our old antenna. It’s easy to install and I love how it can be place virtually anywhere. Would definitely purchase again and highly recommend.",5,1,2019-12-23,1,1,0
Instructions could be better. We used without the amplifier for best quality. It was a challenge to figure out how to scan for channels but once we figured it out(took three of us to do that) and scanned for channels three times in a row we ended up with 28 channels. That’s worth the 28.00 price. Satisfied so far on day one.,4,1,2020-2-16,1,1,0
"I purchased the Digital Indoor HDTV Antenna through Amazon.  The package did not have the extended amplifier in it that was supposed to come with the order.  However, the company shipped a new one right away.  The antenna works great.  I am in a new subdivision as I just purchased a house and the antenna signal is really strong.  Initially, I was able to pick up only 39 channels, but now with the extended amplifier, I am able to pick up 61 channels.  This has been a tremendous help as I go through cable withdraw as I recently cut the cord to expensive cable.  The Antenna is in the window and is not high on a wall or far from the TV.  I'm sure I can probably get even more channels if I moved the antenna around a bit, but I'm highly satisfied as is.  The picture quality is top notch as well.",5,1,2020-2-14,1,1,0
"I don’t have cable, so I bought an antenna to be able to watch the local news, but this antenna has FAR exceeded my expectations! I would’ve been content with just a few channels like ABC, NBC and CBS, but I have over 45 channels! It’s awesome! There’s no pixelating and the color is very clear. My TV is next to a window, so I’m sure that helps. I placed the antenna flat next to the TV since I don’t need to hang it up. I’m very pleased with this antenna, highly recommend!",5,1,2020-1-22,1,1,0
"I ordered this indoor antenna and I am very happy with it so far.  I needed local channels since I'm removing DirecTv so I researched and found this antenna had the best customer reviews.  It took me all of 5 minutes to connect it to my unsmart TV and mount it in my window.  Using the TV remote, the channels added themselves automatically.  I had a little trouble with only 1 local channel but all I had to do was move the antenna a little. I only have 40 channels but that's more than I'll actually watch.  Thank you for an easy setup and even better cost.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,1,0
"This HDTV antenna was just what I was looking for and happy to be able to use it and give my honest opinion. The directions show that this antenna (being flat) can be placed on a Window with the stick-ons – or wall.This is very handy and easy to install.TV antennas used to be big and bulky, and not very effective. Technology really has come a long way… It’s gotten better, lighter, and smaller – like this one. Thank you.",5,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
"This is a great product and so easy to get working. Connect it to your television and run the channel scan, that's it!I have been connected to cable for years spending literally hundreds of dollars for television which I only now realize I could have been enjoying for free.",5,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0

I live in South Austin in a neighborhood that is quite a bit lower in elevation than other areas because it is near Barton Creek and I live near several dry creeks that flow there if and when it rains. The back of my house faces almost due north and the major broadcast antennas are about eight miles north.  I have an antenna on my roof for one TV and a  Moku Leaf on another facing north and I get about 50 channels on each. THIS antenna I put on a window facing south for a little TV in my kitchen. Nothing has been able to bring in many signals (even the Moku Leaf and it is one of the best I've tried). I get over 50 with this antenna.,5,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0
"Wow!  54 + channels.  Extremely easy to install.  Very impressed with number of channels, installation, picture / sound quality.  All for free.  Purchased in case Roku / Hulu isn’t available.  Getting 3 more and Cutting the cable next week.Update:  still working very well.  Bought 3 more and they’re working great.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,1,0
"This antenna can receive about 80% of the broadcast stations in our area, but it took some time to find the right antenna position. It works best near a window up high, so we put it next to a skylight on the ceiling. The cable would be much less obvious if it was white instead of black.Unfortunately our LED track lights interfere with almost all the channels We can't watch them when the lights are on, but that is more of an issue with the lights than with the antenna. Fortunately we have other lights and don't have to watch TV in the dark.",4,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"I had the 'Free TV Key' antenna before finding this gem. With the old antenna, the picture was constantly cutting out, and I got very few channels. I was a little hesitant to buy this one, but after reading all of the reviews, I went for it. And I am SO glad I did! Not only do I receive several more channels, but my shows NEVER cut out like they did before! This is a great antenna, and well worth the money!",5,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0
"I purchased and installed this HDTV antenna for a television located in the lower level of my house, and was amazed as to how easy and fast it was to install, and how many channels I can receive.  Many more than I expected to get.  Installation instructions were clear, and it only took me about ten minutes to set everything up.  I placed the actual antenna on the top sill of the lower window of a double hung window.  Reception is outstanding.  I would recommend this antenna to anyone who wants reception to local broadcast stations without having to install an outside antenna, or having to subscribe to cable for television reception.  This antenna is a winner!",5,1,2020-3-28,1,1,0
"I once purchased an (overpriced) HD antenna thinking I would get the best reception (because I paid more).  I was wrong, the overpriced antenna did not work well at all.  Because of this experience, I was reluctant to purchase another one.  I saw the GESOBYTE antenna online and it had great reviews.  I ordered it and connected it within 5 minutes!  Ran my channel scan and I had channels over-the-air that I didn't even know existed.  Quality is great and I like the short/long range switch.  This was super easy to connect and I was watching HD over-the-air in minutes.  Thank you Gesobyte!!",5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
"I've proudly cut the cable cord for over 10 years now but getting local channels clearly via antenna has not always been the most even exchange. This week I tried a different product than I normally do and am so pleased. First, the cord is actually long enough that I can move it around the room as needed. Second, I get more channels now that my previous antenna and the interference I used to have to tolerate during my local news hour is no longer an issue. Finally, because the antenna is flexible I can mount it anywhere.Thanks! Very happy with this product and I will recommend.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,1,0
"First off I'm about 25 miles from the nearest broadcast tower and I was only able to pick up 30 channels, and not all of them were watchable. It took me about 30 minutes to find a ""sweet spot"" where the antenna picked up good reception and was able to view a few tv shows the first night with little freezing or loss of reception. 24 hours later I couldn't watch any channels without the picture and sound going in and out, on any channel. I scanned for channels again and it didn't fix the issue. How is it that it works fine one day, and then all of a sudden the next day it doesn't? I don't have the patience to move the antenna again and find another good spot so I'm just returning it.",2,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"We were excited to get our HDTV antenna today.  We have tried to do digital antenna’s probably 6 years ago and were not able to get any service.  We thought we would give it a shot again so we could see local news.  We felt it was very necessary with everything going on with the Corona Virus.  It was very easy to install, we put the antenna in the window.  we were able to get 8 channels.  3 of which we will watch - NBC, CBS and CW.  Since those are the networks we watch the most, were were very happy with it.  We live on the edge of the Adirondack mountains in a wooded area so we are just happy we can get service without cable tv.",5,1,2020-3-25,1,1,0
"I just received and set up my Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna.  I bought it to replace an older antenna that I broke off the pull up antenna part.  First off, it took me less than 10 minutes to set up and I love the added Amplifier Signal Booster. I also like the extra long 18 foot cable that reaches a window. That is one of the main reasons I purchased this antenna, besides the streamline look of it.  I now get 179 Digital Channels, more channels than I got with my previous antenna.  I am just amazed at this product, and I am so very happy with my purchase.",5,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0
"I love this antenna!  I just moved into a new place in Wilmington NC and had no cable service.  Thought I would give this a try before looking at cable options.

Very easy to install- just plug it in.I am never going back to paying for cable.",5,1,2020-3-12,1,1,0
"Plugging the antenna into a bus port or placing into electric outlet makes no difference on quality of image.  One does not make it more clearer than the other, the clarity is already very good.  The best feature of this antenna is there has been no picture static on any tv program, no gap between switching channels, cords are long to allow for flexible placement, stickers for mounting, clear readable instructions.  The documentation makes it appear as though the company has taken considerable effort to ensure quality and user satisfaction. The tv picture  responds to tv picture adjustments.  It's a keeper.",4,1,2020-9-13,1,1,0
"This was a great product.  55 channels from an inner room on the 8th floor in a pre-war building in Midtown NYC (i.e. I wasn't even trying to maximize the antenna location--good enough for me).  Quite impressive!!!  Super fast delivery.  Simple installation-10 minutes max, including channel scan.  ""Magic sticker"" allow me to attach to the backside of the TV.

"Read multiple reviews of highly satisfied customers. I ran a couple scans basically on the same wall just 7 feet apart. I prefer to have it in a window but for me and the location of the TV it seems to work better hanging over a chair in the living room. Could be its getting its signal from the opposite direction but I live 30 minutes west of Wash DC so I was aiming it that way. I will say I did pick up some additional channels but not several extras and I'd say the 200 mile radius thing is not even possible. Could be because of clear view or not. I am using it on the 2nd floor. I took my old antenna up to the 3rd floor and it picks up the same channels that the new one picks up that I could not pick up before on the 2nd level. Overall its worth it to me. Whatever channels you do pick up have wonder clarity and definition. Beats the prices of cable, etc.",3,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"I ordered one of these to try on a new 32"" Led TV that I bought to use as a PC monitor, thinking that if it doesn't work I wasn't really planning to use it for watching TV anyway.This is far enough away in the house that I had to add a 20' coax extension to the provided coax cable.  It works perfectly! I was getting more channels on it than we do on the two sets we actually use for watching TV.",5,1,2020-1-18,1,0,0
"I have been using cable for the past 3-4 years and the price only increases for the same services.  It's like doing an annual dance with my ISP/Cable provider that adds services I don't want or need for a (temporarily) lower price... at least until ""the deal"" expires.  No more.  Recently, I have used more streaming services and less TV, but would miss the local channels if I canceled my cable TV altogether.  After some experimenting with location and settling on an outside facing window, the amplified HD antenna allows me to get 30 channels over the air, with very few reception issues.  I am very happy with my purchase, as it will allow me to save over $40 a month.  Well worth the purchase price!",5,1,2020-2-23,1,1,0
"Yea, this thing is weak. Maybe if I covered my house with tinfoil I might get a better signal. I tried all of the methods and nothing seemed to work.

"This was all new to me. I just wanted to put an old TV in the garage without running cable wire from the basement or getting another cable box.  I am more than pleased to have around 50+ channels, including local stations from Detroit and Toledo, the latter being 35 miles away. Who knew??  I am going to try it in the house and maybe cut cable completely and just get internet service.",5,1,2020-5-17,1,2,0
"This maybe the best antenna of this type, but this review is just a caution. The coverage maps do not consider interference from local geography. I should get lots of channels in the Washington DC area, BUT I am located in a river valley with a steep cliff between my house and the TV signals. So my coverage is spotty at best. It was a small investment to find out, so don't be disappointed. Many of the channels I do get are shopping channels or foreign language.",3,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
Great product.  I have recently cut the cable bill and went to a streaming only.  For awhile I tried live TV streaming services but none of them seamed to be worth the money.  Especially since I only really watched local channels. Finally I cut the cable with them and mounted this antenna.  Extremely easy set up and has the few channels I ever watched and paid for... and now it's free!  I wish I realized antenna TV was still a thing a long time ago.  I honestly had no idea that broadcast TV was still around.,5,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0
"I purchased this antenna from Amazon.com and I must say I am very impressed.  The installation and set-up were very easy and the product worked exactly as described.  Including the four sticky tabs for mounting the antenna to the window was an excellent idea and made the installation clean and simple.  From my media room I am able to receive forty-five channels free of charge over the air and with great reception.  I will definitely be recommending this antenna to my friends and family.  My only comment would be that I wish the coaxial cable that connects the HDTV antenna to the television was one meter longer than it is.Great product, thank you!!!",5,1,2020-6-7,1,1,0

When football season came around I searched for streaming of NFL games and discovered that I needed two streaming services that were almost as much as the cable bill. I researched the other options and found that since the games we watch are just for the local team we could just use an antenna. this one had good reviews and was available immediately so I ordered it and got it the next day. Had it installed and operating in less than 10 minutes. Great picture too!",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0

The instructions say that you may need to put the antenna on a window... that wouldn't work where my tv was located so I put it on the wall of my tv console.  It still works perfectly!  It is out of sight and not taking up space on the table top.  Now I have beautiful HD quality TV local channels (plus more) that I can watch for free!  This is great!,5,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0
"We just finished the process of “cutting the cord” with our satellite company. I ended up buying the “U MUST HAVE” Ultra-thin HDTV Antenna from Amazon. I’ll tell you that it lived up to its name because this antenna is a “Must have”. Install in less than five minutes and the antenna pulled in over forty channels. I do not like cables showing so I positioned the antenna behind our living room tv. I plugged the usb into the USB port on the back of my tv to power the antenna (it also comes with a power plug). Very, very easy to install.  Great picture for not only my local channels but many more as well. Highly recommend this product.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,1,0
I recently purchased your Ultra-Thin HDTV antenna from amazon and I could not be more pleased with my decision.  I can see why it was labeled Amazon Bestseller!In my bedroom i had an antenna --did not want more cable cost--and it worked so-so at best.  While it did pick up channels they were always going in and out and not clear by any stretch.,5,1,2020-2-28,1,1,0
Have been dealing with a 2 year old HD ran a channel scan indoor antenna that was causing complaints from my family. We were missing 3 HD TV Broadcast channels that we had been able to get. Received the new HDTV indoor antenna and had it installed in minutes. Very happy family!,5,1,2020-4-29,1,1,0
"I have never owned an HD antenna and recently cut the cord on my cable service. I wanted to have the ability to watch sports broadcast on local channels so I turned to your product. When the box arrived I was surprised at the small size and relatively simple design. I must say I had my doubts on how well this thing would work to give me clear HD channels. I must say I was blown away at the picture quality and I can’t imagine how much easier setup could have been. Thank you so much for an affordable, simple product that makes my decision to cancel cable even more solidified!!!!",5,1,2020-9-24,1,1,0
"I have tried a couple of other antennas in the past but this one is a keeper for me.  ""It works"" for me and fulfills my expectations.  And I'd like to mention I am a long way from any major city and I am happy with the reception I am getting.  This is the best one yet and I do recommend it.  John Martin in North Carolina",5,1,2019-12-30,1,1,0
"We have been held prisoner by Xfinity for years and are finally free.  Every time we would call Comcast to cancel cable and make it internet only (with the idea of buying a digital antenna instead), they would tell us our monthly bill would go UP if we did this-- which makes absolutely no sense... except to their stockholders.  This last time I really let the supervisor have it, because the customer service person had just told me the what ""internet only"" monthly bill would be for a new customer-- without realizing I was an existing customer.  Anyway, we are finally free and super-happy with the new antenna!  The picture is superior to the cable picture and we get almost every channel we watched anyway.",4,1,2020-1-3,1,1,0
"We cut the cable in January 2020 to save money and ordered the HDTV Antenna from Amazon.We should have done this sooner! Picture quality is just as good as cable, friends over for a football game didn't believe it was antenna. We get all the local live channels for free, with cable some networks are ""working out"" their agreement so we lose the channel while they are in negotiations. This won't happen with the antenna!",5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
"I have owned a few of the hd antennas, Iw will say that this one with the 4k option really does offer the advantaged picture.  The extended cable was a nice fit for how I installed my antenna.  The hdmi use is a great feature also! I would highly recommend  this version to anyone doubting the quality of others!",5,1,2020-1-24,1,1,0
"My experience with the HDTV Antenna has been better than any indoor antenna I have ever tried. There is only one channel I am not receiving. Otherwise, it is the clearest picture and most consistent, without interruptions, I have ever had. The value is definitely there and now my friend wants the free one for himself to get rid of his current antenna. He had been thinking about an outdoor antenna but they are expensive. This is a great alternative and with hurricane season coming up a safer investment. who wants to put a new antenna on there roof just to have it torn down in a storm. The other thing is if you move, it moves with you easily.",4,1,2020-6-4,1,1,0
"We’ve been fortunate to stay home and together when the COVID19 pandemic started effecting our lives. We wanted to watch a little TV & keep up with local & national news but didn’t have cable or WiFi. A neighbor suggested an antenna might be the solution to our problem. I ordered your Ultra-thin HDTV Antenna from Amazon. It arrived in great condition & on time. The instructions are easy to follow and setup was easier than expected too. It only took about 30 minutes. Our home is on one level, so high on the wall above a window turned out to be the best placement for our area.Now our non-smart tv w/built-in dvd, gets 25 channels without the amplifier. We’re set!",5,1,2020-4-24,1,1,0
I have tried many different antennae’s but I found this one to be the best. It came as promised and was very easy to hook up and set. The pictures are very clear and it gets all of my channels without having to move the antennae. I have this one on my lanai so I can watch tv and exercise. I intend to get a second one.,5,1,2020-7-25,1,1,0
"I ordered the antennae for our travel trailer when we are camping. However, we are also setting up our camper as an emergency COVID-19 quarantine location for family members (just in case). Upon setting up the antenna, we received double the channels as using the internal TV antenna. It seems the reception is much clearer as well. We hung the antenna from the window so it can be removed easily during travel. See image attached. Very pleased so far.",4,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0
"Update: After completing a review for my still very honest opinion below, I was sent a free antenna that was much different than the one I purchased. This one has a red ""U Must Have"" printed on it and it surprisingly brings in more channels.  Also unlike the one that I purchased, this free antenna is black on both sides making in more sightly in the window rather than a big white back (the side with the adhesives are on the white side)! I am returning this one that I purchased  below but has already purchased another antenna from Amazon that is listed as #1 in Antennas and it has the ""U Must Have"" on it.Hello,",3,1,2020-4-24,1,0,0
"I received my antenna and it works great! I have bought 2 other brands that would pick up channels, but would break up when trying to watch a show. This works just like watching cable, except the picture is even better. I live in the country and can get 25 channels clearly. The installation is very easy and took under a minute.",5,1,2020-2-9,1,1,0
"We purchased our HDTV Antenna after cutting our cable and it works really well.  Installation is quick and painless.  The antenna cord is quite long and looks like it can be extended by adding more coaxial cable.  Hiding it was tricky against white walls and baseboards.  We tried a few positions for the flat antenna, but given our TV's location in the house, ended up leaving it flat on the media center.  It takes some trial an error to find a good window or wall to mount the antenna to get the most amount of stations.  The HD picture and sound is great, definitely recommended for getting national and local news and network TV programming.",5,1,2020-6-4,1,1,0
I am happy to share my experience with your HD TV antenna. We have had it hooked up to our smart TV for over a month and are very happy with our reception.

We feel confident in recommending your product to anyone looking to break away from Cable.,5,1,2020-5-15,1,1,0
"My most recent experience with a TV antenna dated back 10 years ago and it was not pleasant. Recently I'm thinking of switching from cable  tv to Sling, which doesn't have local tv. so I decided to try this hdtv antenna. Ordered it two days ago. Received it today. It was really easy to install and the channel searching was quickly completed. To my surprise, I got 22 local channels, most of them I never knew existed. I tried couple spots for the antenna. Ended with a place near a window. Image quality is very good. I'm glad that I bought this.",5,1,2020-2-11,1,1,0
"This is the second antenna I purchased, the first one worked perfectly on my Samsung,  not a smart TV. The most recent purchase was for a Samsung smart TV but the HDMI cable was different on the TV and the connection from the antenna did not fit. I had to return it. I wish the manufacturer would let the consumer know that it is not a universal hook up.",1,1,2020-1-22,1,1,0
"I was skeptical of this new style antenna.  Have always used rabbit ears but they keep getting broken.  I live on a ridge at a higher elevation with no obstructions.  Pulls in Baltimore stations 38 miles away and Washington 43 miles away.  Doesn't look like much when you open the box, but I'm happy.  It was easy to connect.  Just hung it on the curtain rod.  Then used my TV remote to scan for channels.  I am picking up about 60 channels.  Many are duplicates though between the two markets.  And shopping channels....who watches those?",4,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0
I paid too much for the model not as described on the amazon description. it says 18 ft of coax cable on the description  but it is only actually 13 ft. Wont reach my window. bad advertisement. see pictures. i could have paid a lower price if i ordered coax cable at a shorter length.  This product is misleading customers of actual description of item when you receive it.  Waste of my time and effort.,1,1,2020-2-2,1,2,1
"From Sarasota, FloridaI was very excited to receive a gift of this product from my sister. She did a lot of research on this and your product stood out!  Tips from reviewers were most helpful. This was very easy to install. I used packing tape to apply the unit to my clean window! I also tried moving unit as per instructions and also checked short vs long range capacity. Reception was excellent for channels received.",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
"I received my HDTV antenna on 2/4/20, it was very easy to set up with my Sony TV. I had cancelled my regular cable TV subscription service and was looking for a way to get free local TV channels without paying for cable subscription. This works perfectly out of the Box and i just placed it hidden behind my TV but has windows nearby. The quality of the video is really good and see HD quality, was able to receive all the local channels and a bit more. I am glad that I made one time purchase on this and works flawlessly without any reception issues.",5,1,2020-2-9,1,1,0
"I just installed my new HDTV antenna which took all of about five minutes. Immediately I went from having next to no channels at all to having nearly 50 channels many of which were digital. The quality and the reception is excellent and looks just like it would if it were satellite or cable. I did need to use my own heavy duty double-sided tape to keep it on the drywall, but that's not worth any deduction. I’m very pleased with the quality of this product and how easily it was to install.",5,1,2020-1-10,1,0,1
I went to streaming services some tim ago as cable prices are ridiculous.With the new pandemic I could only get national news.  A friend recommended your antenna and I couldn’t be happier.  I’m reconnected to my community during these difficult times.,5,1,2020-3-18,1,1,0
"My Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna Long 120 Miles Range was easy to install.  I had it connected and working within 20 minutes.  I was able to receive two local channels immediately, regardless of antenna position.  The third one, a CBS broadcaster 60 miles away, I can get by placing the antenna in front of a window and tilting it toward the sky. Internet service is generally poor in my neighborhood.  I use the local cable provider for internet access, and the image I get through my ROKU is not as crisp as the image I get through the antenna.  I can get 20 or 30 channels through the antenna, depending on position.",5,1,2020-3-19,1,1,0
A little note pricy than similar products but works better .  Bought some similar cheaper products but didn’t work as well as this one.  Need to install 6 inches at least away from tv and walls and about 4 ft high .,5,1,2019-11-9,1,2,0
"I had ordered 3 other antennas from a different company that were strongly recommended. They wouldn't pick up the 3 main stations no matter where I put them. Unfortunately it was after my return window so I'm stuck with them. I'm trying not to go back to cable because it's so expensive. So I looked for a different one and chose this one! It's easy to hook up, came with instructions, push pins to attach it to the wall to figure out the best location! I now receive the 3 main stations plus several more that I didn't know existed! I'm so excited! The price was affordable even on a fixed income. I don't ever see myself going back to cable!",5,1,2019-11-21,1,1,0
I am sharing my wonderful experience with your antennae.  I purchased your product on amazon due to the high number of positive reviews and desperate need to replace a previous product Granny’s Home Digital HDTV smart indoor antennae which only got one channel and then developed water inside of it due to a design flaw that allowed condensation to build inside of it.  Once your product was easily mounted and hooked up I scanned for channels and received all of the main basic channels and then some without any static or further problems.,5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0
"We recently purchased your HDTV Antenna after our satellite carrier lost its contract to transmit a local television channel.  We purchased your antenna so we could watch the Superbowl and  local programming.The instruction were good and I had no trouble hooking up the antenna to my television, actually it was quite easy.  Since then we were able to watch the football game and subsequent shows.",5,1,2020-2-4,1,2,0
Antenna was very easy to install and program. I was able to receive 4 HD channels. I live in a very rural area and was pleasantly surprised to receive any channels at all on an indoor antenna.

"Setup was incredibly easy. I paired my antenna with a Tablo DVR and initially ran into an issue picking up channels during the Tablo scan, however this ended up being a Tablo related issue and not an antenna issue. I'm very pleased with the number of channels the antenna was able to pick up, as well as the quality of the video/audio. The antenna does need to be very close to a window -- I was hoping I could keep it hidden, but the video gets too choppy.Wish I knew about these HDTV antennas and made the switch from cable years ago.",5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
"We just ""cut the cord"" on our cable, but still wanted access to view network television and purchased your product.  I can't get over how easy the set up was to get up and running.  I own a smart tv with a built-in receiver, so I needed nothing but the antenna and the tv to get 48 more channels!  Majority of the reception is crystal clear and many are in HD.  The signal amplifier is incredible at boosting the reception to full signal strength in most of the channels.  Last time I used an antenna on a tv (many moons ago), I remember turning the rabbit ears around and around to try to get something other than a fuzzy signal.  This is a tremendous upgrade and it makes my decision to cut the cord an excellent one.  Thanks for this great product and I will be recommending it to friends",5,1,2020-1-28,1,0,0
"I was fearful about cutting the cable because you can get a lot of shows streaming, but I like live TV.  This antenna was super easy to install.  Great reception.  If the weather is really poor, the connection can come and go.  But nothing is perfect.  90% of the time I have no complaint.",5,1,2020-3-11,1,1,0
Test product absolutely does not work. I left 20 miles from broadcast station and cannot receive any stations with this antenna. I contacted the company and they said I needed a hundred and fifty mile unit I did not realize the unit is supposed to be good for 120 miles.

"Hi, I received my HDTV antenna this week. I moved a LED TV to a location without cable TV and wanted to see the quality of the picture using this HDTV antenna. WOW, the picture is perfect and I picked up about 40 free HDTV channels in Chicago suburb area.Thanks for a great product that saves money!",5,1,2020-4-25,1,1,0
This product works better than I had expected it to work. The picture quality is just as good as cable. We are glad we cut our cable and bought this digital antenna. We will no longer have to wait in order to watch local channels if we ever move!! This is one of the best investments we have made.,5,1,2020-9-4,1,1,0
This was easy to put up straight out of the box. The long cord made it easy to stick it to my window and hide the cord on the way to the TV. The stickies in the kit are large and effective; another antenna I purchased a few years ago had tiny stickies that didn't work very well and I had to supply my own double sided tape. I did not have that problem here. I live in a major city so I have a lot of clear channels available and they come through clear and without interruption.,5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
Our tape measure must be broken... The 18' cable included only measures 10'.We've been putzing with this for at least 1/2 hour and do have some channels with nice clear pictures - IF - one of us holds the black pad close to the outer wall near a window. Obviously that is not a permanent option.,3,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
Ordered my antenna through Amazon.  The description seemed accurate.  Very easy to install. One step I missed initially was turning the switch ‘on’.  Could ship the unit with the switch in the on position.  I got zero channels to come up first time.  Unit really does make pictures appear sharper and sound seems better.  Happy with the product.E.

"This was a great addition after eliminating cable. We get 25 channels all local and it’s just what we wanted with most the price tag. We live in a mountainous region so I’m not surprised we didn’t get a TON of channels but I’m happy with what we got, install was very easy.",5,1,2020-6-13,1,1,0

I would highly recommend these to others.",5,1,2020-2-21,1,1,0
"When I first purchased this, I was a little worried about missing out on a lot of TV.  Since installing it, I realized that I don't watch regular TV that much anyways.  The nice this about this antenna is that I found that I have a lot of digital channels that are already on my TV.  The amount and quality of channels are all dependent on your local area and signal, so be sure to check before purchasing.",4,1,2020-4-22,1,1,0
This antenna is great!  Reception is great and I love that it is so light that we can move it around as needed.  We often watch a smart tv outside and this antenna enables us to get local channels without having to deal with moving a cable box.  Love free free free channels.,5,1,2020-7-21,1,1,0
"I probably have one of the most complex home systems in the US. I have 10 TV's (one outside). I use  a COAX-Mixer (input/output on all ports).  I also use the VeCOAX HDMI to Coax prior to the distribution of the Dish stuff. I feed the ten TV's and have three inputs on the mixer. One input is a Dish Hopper, one input is a Dish Joey, the third is the antenna input. This antenna has provided the best reception (yes is is on the second level with metal exterior siding). I have both strong and week signals in my area. The booster doesn't reduce the strong too much but assists the weaker signals. I would recommend this product.Mark",5,1,2020-2-23,1,1,0
"This antenna is great. It was very easy to set up and install. I had tried a couple of other antennas but would only get a couple of my local stations. The first time after installing this antenna and scanned my stations it brought up a whole lot more than the other antennas did. Now i get all my local stations and everyone is crystal clear. And so many other stations also. I just wish i had purchased this one to start with. I love the longer cord to place it where you need to have it get the best reception. And i only had to move it once. I love mine. So if you are thinking about cutting the cord, this is the antenna for you for your local stations and so much more.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,1,0

I live 12 miles from Pittsburgh up on a hill so you would think this product would have done a better job than the homemade antenna I was using.  Prior to this purchase I was using a two foot coax cable stripped down to just the center copper cable except for a couple inches at the coax nut.

I have tried 4 different kinds of antennas and amplifiers. The last one I had was bringing in 15 channels (and i had it connected to an amplifier) and when I put this one in the same location it brings in 49 channels. I am really pleased. I was amazed. It must have some good amplifier circuit or something. My other antenna and amplifier would get blips of other channels but nothing enough to keep the channel. This antenna gave 2 bars of signal on the same channels.,5,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0

I tried scanning and scanning and was only able to pick up 34 channels so I decided to look for a new antenna. Upon stumbling onto your product on amazon and looking through the review, I decided to try your product. Once I got your product and did the scan, I was able to get over 100 channel (132 channels).

I purchased an HDTV antenna from Target for almost double the price of this one and returned it to days later. I was only able to get 1 full channel with it. I found THIS HDTV Antenna on amazon and figured I would give it a shot. I am pleased so far with the performance. Like I said, I live in a pretty rural area so I haven't had as much luck as everyone else receiving 50+ channels but I was able to get a few with it's signal!

Our most popular channels here are ABC, Fox, NBC and CBS.  Neither of these could receive all 4 of there.  The exterior antenna brought in all 4, but is kinda hideous looking on the house and requires the bulky co-ax cable.Now this HDTV Antenna loses the enormous amount of bulky co-ax cable and requires no drilling in the exterior wall.

Those things you'd wake up to as a child and didn't care at all to actually pay attention to, but the background noise was comfort. Mostly I wanted to just see if it worked and guess what? It does! Plugged that baby in and instant channels. I can now watch Jerry Springer while working from home. Definitely worth the few dollars it costs.",5,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0

"I recently bought this antenna for my mother. She doesn’t like the bells and whistles of cable but she does enjoy watching the local news at 5 and 10. She had a different antenna and it was always causing her problems. Half the time she couldn’t get the picture to come in or it would pause and jump forward, cutting out parts of the show. NOT ANYMORE! This antenna has been smooth sailing for the past few weeks and I stopped getting phone calls from my mother that included a ten-minute rant about her news programs. It has been very helpful. I would recommend this to anyone. Thank you!",5,1,2020-5-19,1,1,0
This product works great for me! I had been using another indoor antenna that was working great for a short period and then started losing reception while watching tv. It was getting really annoying and decided to try another indoor antenna just to see if it was maybe because I live near mountains. When this one came in I plugged it right in and it gets every channel and has not lost reception for 1 second! I was getting ready to reconnect cable service or get an outdoor antenna. Glad I didn’t lose hope!,5,1,2020-9-26,1,1,0
I am extremely pleased with this product. I was hesitant about purchasing this as I really did not have a window that was assessable to mount it on. I placed it as high as the cord would allow and the reception is incredible! It was a little trial and error but after finding the correct television input slot everything went smoothly.The only downfall is if the weather is quite cloudy the picture breaks up on some of the channels where the towers are furthest away.,5,1,2020-5-26,1,1,1
We have had the old style rabbit ear antenna for years in our guest room. Due to both of us working in the medical field we are having to self quarantine at home. Meaning one of us was getting the basic 5 channels with the old antenna. Decided to purchase the extra.hdtv antenna and upgrade our selection. It was so worth the purchase. Getting extra channels is such a nice perk. Thank you!,5,1,2020-5-13,1,1,0
"5 stars all around. Incredibly easy setup. Excellent reception,  I'm pulling in around 60 channels OTA in the Orlando area. Excellent picture and audio quality from said channels. This is the only indoor antenna I've tried that actually gave me usable results.  This thing is excellent and I would highly recommend it for anyone looking to cut the cord.",5,1,2019-12-9,1,1,0
"We cut the cord on cable, and moved to your antenna. We live in Iowa, and while we do not have many channels, the closest towers were quite a distance from us. I love how lightweight this antenna is, and how well it works. We had purchased one at our local store that was heavy and inefficient.",5,1,2020-4-24,1,1,0
"Omg! My big antenna in the attic couldn't pull in channels.  But this little thing placed in my window pulls in stations from about 40 miles away! Looks like the picture is about 720, but I don't care.  I'm saving $15 per month over my cable provider.",5,1,2020-6-25,1,1,0
"This has a long range short range switch on it. I thought it was a joke but it really makes a difference. Picture quality is better than two other antennas I have. Compared to the one I am replacing, there’s no comparison. Price is great too.",5,1,2020-7-24,1,1,0
The ease of set up is about two minutes then its plug and play.  I went from 6 channels to about 38.  If some channels don't come in adjust your antenna and rescan your tv for channels and grab the popcorn......just wanted to update their stock picture is not what I received but the picture I attached and it work great.,5,1,2019-12-12,1,1,1
"We recently cut the cord for cable, but with the NFL season upon us I had no way to watch my Dallas Cowboys in action.  After researching options I decided to try a HD antenna for the first time.  I looked at several different brands on Amazon before settling with the Gesobyte HD antenna due to price and reviews. Once received, it was easy to install.  It took some adjusting to find the right spot for the antenna but I must say that I am extremely happy with the purchase.  The NFL games come in crystal clear with no signs of screen tearing.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
"I would absolutely recommend this antenna. It took me less than 10 minutes to set up and scan channels. In my area, I have about 20 channels and the picture quality is excellent. I will be purchasing another for a tv in my spare room. It's also saving me $100/month to not have cable anymore!",5,1,2020-5-24,1,1,0
We love this Gesobyte digital antenna. I recently purchased it through Amazon and I’m very happy with it. I am able to get over 40 digital channels. All my local channels that I really wanted and many others that I didn’t expect . Superb quality and high definition. I have recommended it to all of my friends who are looking to cut the cable and stop paying these outrageous prices.This is all you need and it’s so much less expensive than subscriptions..,5,1,2020-9-13,1,1,0
"I bought three different indoor antennas trying to find which one would work best. One was the same price as this one and the other was $70 more expensive. This one definitely gave me the best reception and the most channels, so I sent the other two back!  It is super easy to install and it is giving me excellent reception. I am very pleased with the quality of the picture; so much better than cable. Excellent in all ways.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"Over the years I have bought several digital antennas and this is the best for several reasons.  Size, amplifier that actually works and two sided color on antenna “pad” to allow it to better blend in surrounding.I am probably going to buy a second one for another room that I don’t have cable/satellite currently.",5,1,2019-12-15,1,1,0
"I lost so many channels, thought it was the weather or something - then I thought heck, maybe it's this old TV antenna that I got a few years back - figured I""d try this one and I'm amazed - ALL those channels I couldn't get - I GOT EM BACK!  It's awesome!",5,1,2020-9-25,1,1,0
"After dwindling down to mostly just watching local network. stations, we decided to discontinue our cable service for now until we decide on a permanent configuration for watching all content.  In the meantime, this antenna is the PERFECT solution to pull in the networks and many other fun channels to watch---for FREE!!!Set-up only took about 10 minutes and we were amazed that we had TV again!!!",5,1,2020-2-6,1,1,0
"Good evening, on receiving our antenna we hooked it up immediately to our TV. We got excellent reception. We are not able to get all our locan channels which is interesting but has been an issue no matter what type of antenna we have used. We love it because it is so clear, much better than any other we have used. We love the 18 foot cord. We do wish there were a better way to attach it to the wall. Small hooks or something like that would be better. The sticky tabs don't last very long at all. Overall it is a great product and we are very satisfied. Thank you",4,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"This is a pretty good antenna. It has a long range due to the length of the cable attached to the antenna. Many have short cables or attach directly to the back of the tv which limits your ability to place the antenna. The long cord on this one allows you to move the antenna around to find the best location for you. And for the price, you’re not going to do much better than this one.",5,1,2020-3-18,1,1,0
I first tried the antenna on a television I had on the first floor and then on the second floor.  I live between 35 and 45 miles away from the transmitters in my area.  On the first floor I was able to receive 12 channels pretty regularly and occasionally 16.  On the second floor I was able to receive over 30.  It does a nice job and was easy to install.,5,1,2020-2-19,1,1,0
"I am very pleased with the reception, no freezing or loss of signal with this antenna.The only improvement I would suggest are the adhesive squares that come with the antenna. They could be a better quality. The antenna kept falling of the wall. I had to use small thumbtacks to keep my antenna on the wall.",5,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0
"Let's start off by saying for $30, this is worth it.Pros: For the price, the quality of picture is about what you would expect. Definitely not 4K as advertised but still very clear 720p and most 1080p. I actually received more channels than I initially thought I would, so thats definitely a bonus. Once placed in the correct location, the connection seems to be steady.",4,1,2020-9-12,1,0,1
Installed in less than 5 minutes. Picture quality is really sharp. I was able to scan and double the number of available channels I was getting with ears (26 vs 54). I highly recommend for those looking to cut the cord.,5,1,2020-9-13,1,1,0
"I just finished setting up my Gesobyte amplified HD antenna and was very please with how easy it was to set up and the minimal amount of time it took to auto program the TV stations in my area. I now have access to a mix of SD and HD channels, of which all come in very clear.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
We thoroughly enjoy the quality reception our Gesobyte gives us.  We get great reception with over 59+ channels in our area.  Additionally we take it with us when we go camping as it gives us better reception than the antenna that our 2019 camper came with.  We often camp off the grid and the channels the GB HDTV antenna is just amazing.Thanks for a Great Product..,5,1,2020-9-11,1,1,1
"Wow, I was really impressed with your antenna.  I am way down South Texas and was expecting to get 8 maybe 10 channels, to my surprise I got 22.  No they are not repeated.  Thank you sooo much.  I will definitely recommend this product to my friends.  I will  kick my Cable bill goodbye forever.",5,1,2020-5-1,1,1,0
"I bought one of your antennas from Amazon.com.  I have gone through 3 antennas, and yours was reasonably priced, simple to install, and BY FAR the best results of any of my previous purchases.  We added around 25 channels and all but a few are crystal clear.  I live 20 miles or so west of downtown Chicago.  Thanks for the great product!  I was skeptical when I bought it but it’s a winner period.  We use it everyday--on our first floor.  Going to get another for my upstairs TV for sure.",5,1,2020-4-30,1,1,0
"The reviews don’t lie. This works. Internet is a bit too crappy for our Firesticks where I live, so I ordered 2 of these for the bedrooms. Installation was EASY. My daughter actually picks up 14 crystal clear channels in her room and I get 12 in my room.",5,1,2020-5-19,1,1,0
Just received my hdtv antenna. Super easy to set up and use. My channels are so clear and bright. Definitely a wonderful purchase for my new smart TV!I loooove that I'm getting twice as many channels as I was getting with my old bunny ears.,5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0

"It took an extra day to receive my product but that's not the products fault. I got it and was able to hook it up, scan for channels and start watching TV within 15 minutes.

"Hey All,We purchased a Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna last week.",5,1,2020-2-4,1,1,0
I have a 75-mile radius antenna like this but I have trouble picking up some channels.  Figured this 120-mile antenna might fix that issue.  Nope.  I am actually getting 4 channels LESS than with my other antenna.  Waste of money if you already have an antenna this one won't give you any better reception or channels.  Misleading.,1,1,2020-1-12,1,2,0
I am 77.  I purchased your antenna from Amazon because it had been highly recommended to us.  I activated your antenna today. It works beautifully and reception was great. I have another antenna that I had purchased and it was unusable and cost more that yours.  We are very happy to be able to get the local channels we need so we can now “cut the cord”.  Thanks for making this exceptional product. It is attractive in regard to not having rabbit ears and can be positioned in many places and not be intrusive.,5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"Got 5 channels, my old one I got 35. I have no idea why it’s rated so high. Is this another amazon seller who buys their way to the top.Total junk",1,1,2020-2-6,1,2,0
Ordered this HDTV antenna hoping that it would work in my area.  It exceeded my expectations and I now can watch all the channels that I normally watched on cable tv.The instructions on set up were very good and set up is very easy. I am extremely happy with this product and the prompt service and delivery.,5,1,2020-6-15,1,1,0
"We are having a great experience! Hooking up the antenna was easy and after ‘repositioning’ it a couple of times, we picked up 25 channels! Most of these channels have crystal clear reception, while a few have weaker signals. For us, our TV 'needs' are met. We use the HDTV antenna to pick up 'broadcast TV' and Hulu to pickup the 'already aired shows'. Hulu's 'already aired' plan is about $6/mo whereas their Live TV subscription is about $60/mo. Using a combination of the HDTV antenna and Hulu's 'already aired' subscription saves us about $54/mo! That's about $650 per year that can go to other uses.",5,1,2020-5-20,1,1,0
"We recently decided to get rid of our cable and use online services like Netflix and Hulu.  When Football season was approaching we knew that we would want access to local channels so decided to try this HDTV Antenna.  At first we struggled to find more than a few channels but after moving the antenna to a new location by a window we found a spot that would give us all the channels we are looking for and more.  We are very happy with the reception and have no issues watching our football games, local news and more.  We are very happy we went with the HDTV Antenna!",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
"Think twice. Am returning this. It started, worked well.That said, my other channels, firestick, wifi, etc were GONE. would NOT turn off my tv. I have vid of the pics. Had to unplug tv. Unplug wifi.",1,1,2020-5-22,1,0,0
"Finding a signal is a pain but that's easily solved by using any available signal detector apps on your phone to help you point your antenna in the right direction. The included power supply may not push enough juice to the unit so you can use any other USB power supply that can supply 5VDC and more than just the 500mA than the included one (or your TV USB port.) I think it might actually help. Once I got this baby pointed in the sweet spot, I was able to pick up over ten channels from over 50 miles away. More than sufficient for my needs! Would recommend to anyone who needs a cheap quick and functional antenna for HDTV OTA channels!",5,1,2019-11-12,1,1,0
"This worked perfect for my outdoor she shed tv. I easily installed it myself. It picked up loads of channels and has an awesome picture. It makes my outdoor tv work as well, if not better, than my in house TVs connected to cable. Definitely recommend it.",5,1,2020-6-10,1,1,0
"This antenna is great.  We live in a rural area where the signal is weak.  We tried several different antennas and some worked better than others but none worked nearly as well as the HDTV antenna.  I had doubts because it is so inexpensive, but what a great surprise.  Before the HDTV antenna there were some channels that we just could not get at all.  We lost signals during shows, sometimes the picture was scrambled or frozen and we could get some channels on one TV and other channels on another TV.  With the HDTV we get more channels and a much clearer picture as a bonus.",5,1,2020-5-15,1,1,0
"We bought 3 antennas for our 2 TVs, this will be one of the two we are keeping. We live 35 miles from the nearest station and we were able to get 23 channels with this antenna. The picture quality is excellent. We had to move the antennas to find the best spot a couple of times and rescan, but we are happy with the picture quality now.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,1,1
I liked that it was very easy to setup and could choose to use the attachable amplifier in order to find more channels. I had difficulty with my new TV in finding the setup screen and the search for channel page but I finally got it to work. I only had to move the antenna 1 time to get better reception. The stickers were easy to work with as well. Easy instructions to follow so anyone can put it together and make it work. Appreciate the quality of the antenna as the channels are crystal clear.  I only did 3 because I was told I would get 2 free antennas for 2 reviews but I never got any extra.,3,1,2020-4-17,1,1,0
"Had hoped this would provide several channels but unfortunately we were only able to get a total of 5 which was only two more than we had without an antenna of any kind.  Tried moving it to as many locations as we could hoping for better reception, but that didn't work either.  Had to give up and order a cable service.  It was easy to install and the picture quality was good, but I couldn't rate it very high because of the small number of channels it brought in.",3,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"I bought this antenna because it advertises a 120 mile range. We ""cut the cable"" recently and I needed it for local stations. So far, the reception is 70% max and I am receiving about 60 channels. I would love it if the reception was 100%, but I am rural and it's probably just the area.",4,1,2020-2-27,1,1,0

This antenna is great! We have purchased other antennas to use in our bedroom upstairs and the signal is never strong enough to receive local channels. Someone recommended this one so we tried it out and its amazing! Super easy to install and we instantly received local channels that came in clear with no fuzzy picture.,5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
"I can't get but one local channel! I live in Dallas, Texas.  The other channels are Vietnamese, Spanish, Indian, Chinese. I don't speak any of these languages, and a shopping channel.  None of the networks advertised. Disappointing! No news channels! Wondering if leaving AT@T was a wise decision! We've tried every angle above the window, in the window, above the TV, but reception comes in and out with some programming.  I can't get channels 4,5,8 LOCAL Channels!N",2,1,2019-12-27,1,2,0
I made the mistake of buying several cheaper antennas that did not have such a great range as the GESOBYTE Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna Long 200+ Miles Range. Now I can get all the channels I was hoping to receive. Everything was easy about this antennas. Highly recommended.,5,1,2020-9-1,1,1,0
"I went in on this purchase thinking it would be similar to the other antenna purchases I've made, but I'm happy to say I was wrong. The quality on this antenna is much better than I was expecting.

I would highly recommend this one!",5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0

I just purchased the HD digital TV antenna from your company via Amazon. This product works great and was much cheaper than many of the same kinds of devices sold at big chain stores.

"Really like the durability and thin material of this antenna. Picture quality is excellent. Unfortunately we live in a rural area and reception isn’t great, but that’s not the fault of the antenna. We need a booster or rooftop antenna. The channels we do receive are of excellent quality. I do wish it came with extra stickers to attach to the wall. I kept moving the antenna to check for best reception and when I was done the stickiness had worn off.",4,1,2020-2-18,1,0,0
I liked the clear directions with the enlarged pictures.  It was very easy to install. Hint: you can check online where the best signal direction should be as I live in a high density city (New Orleans).  I found also to use a suction cup hook on the window was helpful.  The length of stretch was great as I have very high ceilings. The picture quality is excellent. I would buy again.,5,1,2020-6-22,1,2,0
"I’m so happy with this antenna!! I’m able to get about 7 channels for FREE, including local news! This is saving me about $120 per month. Picture quality is great!  I was super apprehensive to get this, but I’m so glad I did! It works wonderfully!!",5,1,2020-7-16,1,1,0

I'm just shocked at how paper thin this antenna is. When I seen it I'm thinking there is no way ever this is going to work. Man was I ever wrong. It pulled in 17 channels. Also the picture quality is amazing. They all come in crystal clear and I'd say the picture quality is better than cable or satellite picture quality. I've tried other antennas in the past only to get about 6 or 7 channrels. This is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to cut the cable cord.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,1,0

Connected antenna without an amplifier to my kitchen TV. I placed the antenna on the wall behind TV. Initially was skeptical but after a scan it found 73 channels! Many of them are in HD quality.

"Love this I had an old non-powered antenna and I would have to move it around to get whichever channel the game was on. I only need the antenna for 4 channels.

My picture is crisp and clean. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this antenna",5,1,2020-9-24,1,1,0
"Worked better than I anticipated. Installed in my attic, to a splitter, to work in 4 bedrooms, and the living room. Pick up 47 channels, from about 30 miles outside of New Orleans.

I love this antenna.  Bought a new TV and did not want to pay for another cable box.  This was easy to set up and I get a very clear picture with over 100 channels.  I also like the long cord so I can move it by my window.  Highly recommend.,5,1,2020-9-6,1,1,0

The Digital HDTV Antenna is the best antenna we have had. Our previous antennas were tall and bulky and kept falling over.

We opted to purchase the antenna and to our surprise, we are now receiving 25 full-HD channels in our home.

I was able to get pretty much most of the channels available for my area and the picture where as expected. I have no complains.

I have ALL the channels I PAY for with cable - FREE! AND, I get more channel options in the airwaves without having to pay for them.",5,1,2020-9-5,1,1,1
We have decided to cut the cord. There are plenty of things to watch for free if you have internet access. One thing there is precious little of is local content.

In my opinion you can't beat this for the price.,5,1,2020-8-1,1,0,0
"The installation was easy. Good picture quality. I was expecting the cable to be longer. I have the white side facing out, as it matches my trim, but it has red where the antenna connects to the cable, that should be white also in my opinion.

It took a while to find a good spot, but at the best points we got over 40 channels, which included a nice variety. We must not be near enough the towers because sometimes the picture goes in and out. But for the price, it was a really great buy!",5,1,2020-4-11,1,1,0
"I have to admit, I was totally surprised when I hooked up the antenna and saw all of the channels I could get with the antenna.  I have a smart tv, and several free channels were there without the antenna, however, after installing it, I am now receiving 77 channels.  I was also amazed at the clarity of the picture.  You would never know by watching the tv if you were using a cable hook-up or an indoor antenna.  I purchased another type of antenna for my Granddaughter a couple of years ago.  She is only able to receive 15 channels with that antenna, and the reception on some channels is not great, so I was not hopeful when purchasing this antenna.  I was pleasantly surprised!",5,1,2019-12-18,1,1,0
WOW! SO easy to install and I received around 88 live channels. I had no TV in our Exercise room and so I purchased a 24 inch TV and installed this Antenna and the picture is gorgeous and there is so much to watch! It a great value and works like a charm. Now I understand why people stop paying for cable!!! You will be pleased. It also has very long cords if you need to move it somewhere to get the best reception. I HIGHLY recommend this product.,5,1,2019-11-26,1,1,0
I'm very pleased at how easy it was for me to install this HD Digital TV Antenna.  It took less than 5 minutes. Part of that time was  me trying to decide where I want to put it.  I ended up sticking it on the wall beside my TV.  I was glad that I didn't need to put it on my window since my TV is not that close to the window.  The price is very reasonable.I live in a rural area.  I am able to get 24 clear channels with this antenna.  I could only get 16 channels with a  different brand antenna I purchased previously.,5,1,2020-9-9,1,1,0
I decided for the 1st time to try a more high tech antenna. I was used to old school a tennis that sit on top of TVs. I was extremely hesitant in getting one because I live in a very country county surrounded by trees and back roads. All I have to say I am glad I purchased and set this antenna up on one of my TVs. I was able to get 38 channels and 30 of them I actually watch. It even pulled specific cartoon channels which made grandson a very happy mom because my little guy was jumping for joy. I am very impressed with your product.,5,1,2020-1-16,1,1,0
I liked it because it's light enough for me to move it around & get a better tv picture. Because it looks like a product that I thought was not going to work effectively due to its light weight...I was really surprised that this antenna did its job,5,1,2020-6-22,1,1,0
Only needed one local station for local news and got several. I gave up on all the big cost of cable and sat. So glad. I'm saving a ton of money by just going with this and Amazon Prime. Hardest part was figuring out the SAMSUNG auto tuning portions. lol,5,1,2020-5-6,1,1,0

I recently purchased one of these antennas for my mother to replace one I got for her a few years back from a big box store.  I had done a little research online and read some reviews about this product and hopped it would be an upgrade over the couple of poor quality channels she got with her old antenna and wow!

The solar panels I have on the roof do not seem to interfere with the signal reception.",5,1,2020-2-17,1,1,1

I received my HDTV antenna few days ago and I am quite happy with it.I have increased my channel reception to 50% and on top the quality of the picture.,5,1,2020-3-18,1,1,0
"Mounting the antenna on the wall was easy and not an eye sore, after running the channel search I was very happy with the number of channels, the option to add the power amplifier or not is a good feature, I'm really happy with this antenna!",5,1,2020-5-14,1,1,0
"This was the superior model of two different ones I purchased at the same time.  It allowed my HDTV to pick up 38 stations in Bellevue, WA (in the signal shadow of Clyde Hill).  Previous intermittent signals are now clearly picked up, and new stations were discovered.  Installation was simple.  I taped the antenna to a basement window only one foot above ground level.  After a few false starts with other products, it was nice to find a keeper.",5,1,2020-3-23,1,1,1
Super happy with our new indoor antenna! Can pick up quite a few channels (I bought it primarily to watch PBS CreateTV) and a nice surprise was also catching the Super Bowl with crystal clear reception the day we set it up.Recommending this antenna to friends and family!,5,1,2020-3-15,1,1,0
"130 mi Range?. This thing works exactly as would expect an antenna of this price costs. I live less than 35 miles from every over the air television station in m area and this thing picks up one of them and that is with insane positioning. Antenna is crazy flimsy, once you pick it up you will totally understand the poor quality. Do not buy this unless you live in a small apartment right on top of a tv station.",1,1,2020-1-6,1,2,0
Really easy to hook up within minutes. Scanned my TV and now get 18 channels where before I only got 6.,5,1,2020-5-5,1,2,0
Experience so far has been great. We set up the antenna with our TV in our media room in a walkout basement and were able to get the full suite of digital broadcast channels very quickly. Signal is strong and doesn’t seem to be interfered with by being in our basement. Haven't needed the extra range as we're within 30mi of downtown Denver.,5,1,2020-6-27,1,1,0
Have tried several indoor antennas on our bedroom TV. It was a simple hook up one screw did not even use the amplifier and are receiving 18 channels most of which in HD. I would recommend this antenna to anyone that has had trouble with other ones we're very happy with this unit. Thank you,5,1,2020-3-29,1,1,0
"We had purchased an antenna that wasn't picking up our channels and a family member recommended this product. It arrived quickly, was easy to install, and works beautifully. They use stick-on backing to hang on the wall, not push pins, so you should take your time in considering where you will place it if you need to put it on the wall. We are getting channels that we have never received before and the picture is perfect. I would buy this again.",5,1,2020-5-12,1,1,0
"Well it was very easy to setup and while I didn't expect much of a result I was pleasantly surprised that I pulled in 41 channels with good signals. While I don't know about the 200mile range part I was able to pull in all known local channels with ease and I didn't mount it near a window, only aimed at one.",5,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0

"The HDTV  Antenna is a great product. It is an indoor and directional antenna. I live in the San Fransisco Bay Area about 60 miles south of San Fransisco. Installed it with ease and positioned the antenna towards San Fransisco in one of my upstairs bedroom wall, closer to the ceiling. Picked up about 45 San Fransisco TV channels. 20 of them were in English and the remaining were in Vietnamese, Chinese, Spanish and other languages. Picture quality of the ones that I am interested in is very good.Great product, elegant design and I highly recommend it.",5,1,2020-6-7,1,1,0
"This was very simple to hook up and find channels. I installed it behind the tv in the living room (exterior wall) using Command velcro strips, and only one local channel had weak reception. I also tested this recently during a storm, and that station had too weak of a signal to show at all, while other stations were somewhat choppy, if anything. I wish I had a better place to install it to improve reception, but I definitely would buy again.",4,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"Although dtv.gov showed I could get a weak signal where I live, I get no stations. One station is around 36 miles away straightline distance. I live in a hilly area, but my home is fairly high in the hills with the closest hill about 1000 feet higher than the house. I was just hoping this would work.",1,1,2020-2-27,1,1,0
This was the second HDTV Antenna I purchased due to the original getting the cord ripped off do to a window being opened to fast.  I live way out in the country surrounded by a lot of trees and this antenna does great.  I do get more channels on it during the winter months due to the lack of leaves on the trees but even during the summer I get a good amount.  The picture quality is awesome and set up is a breeze.,5,1,2020-9-9,1,1,0
"I wasn't sure if this would work but my son installed it in two minutes and after the 10 minutes for set up - we received over 40 free channels with excellent picture quality. We are 25 miles from the closest large city but that wasn't an issue. If you can switch between your streaming channels and your cable provider, you can switch just as easily to the hd antenna for viewing. Just need to buy a standalone DVR and then we'll be cancelling our Dish contract. Looking forward to it!",5,1,2020-3-29,1,1,0
"I'm not quite getting 120 mile range, but I live in a Row Home, and I'm in a valley. I was surprised by the quality of the HD picture and I get 29 channels. My only regret is that I should have done it sooner. We had to try about 10 different locations, within a few feet of each other the number of channels ranged from 9 to 29.Very happy with this Antenna.",5,1,2020-2-15,1,1,0
"Easy to setup. I get channels for free now, I was able to get rid of cable. I was paying over $100 a month to watch my local channels which is broadcasted free, does that make sense? Lol...no it dont. This will allow you to cut your cable for watching local channels.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,1,0
"I can’t even begin to tell you how satisfied I am with the purchase of this HDTV antenna. I set up the antenna on my new 75 inch TV and I started flipping through channels and I was so amazed on the quality of all the channels and the amount of channels that I’m able to see with this HDTV antenna. There are so many choices out there but I am so happy and glad that I bought this particular one because of all the channels I get. I would highly highly highly recommend purchasing this product/HDTV antenna to anyone, I would actually buy this product again.",5,1,2020-2-14,1,1,0
I wish I had used this antenna to cut my cable TV costs by $100 per month. I am so Busy nowdays. This free TV antenna lets me watch local and US news for free. I added a little HULU and I am set.I will likely buy a second TV antenna for my second bedroom.,5,1,2020-2-24,1,1,0
"I installed the U Must Have HDTV antenna this morning and receive 22 channels.  It was so easy to set up, plug in the coaxial cable, plug in the USB cable. Stick the antenna and search for channels.  That's it, and I'm watching air broadcast television for free!  The picture quality is good, better than I expected.  I stuck the antenna to the back of my television even, so not to notice it in the room.  I am very satisfied with the purchase.",5,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0

"I recently disconnected cable because we weren't watching it enough to be paying so much for it. But Football season is here!!! I bought this antenna hoping it will give me my local channels to be able to catch some of the games. I was so excited that it did. It was ever easy to set up,  either power it thru your tv usb or an outlet and plug in the cable. Find a good place to stick the antenna and you are good to go.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
"I was skeptical; living in rural NC near the VA border in a valley at the foot of a mountain where two rivers come together, reception has always been a challenge.  THIS antenna rocks.  25 stations loud and clear and the nearest broadcast transmitter is 50+ miles.  Took about 45 minutes to find the right spot and received ABC, CBS, NBC, ION,CW, Fox andf a slew of substations.  Best 30 bucks I ever spent",5,1,2020-2-18,1,1,1
"I just installed my HDTV antenna and I am so impressed. I had an older hd antenna that I had purchased a few years ago and my reception had become increasingly poor. This one was easy to set up and right away I got all of the local stations back, plus about 10 more!",5,1,2020-3-17,1,1,0
"Cannot speak for other reviewers or read other reviews. For my experience, it is great! Easy setup, great picture, cable is long enough that an extension wasn’t necessary. Power plug supplied to plug the usb amplification into an outlet instead of the back of the TV. Got 56 digital OTA channels from within  my local area. Cannot give it enough thumbs up! Would highly recommend to those seeking to cut ties with cable!",5,1,2020-6-14,1,1,0
"I recently bought one of these HD TV Antennas and installed it in my attic, as I was ditching the high-dollar EXPEN$IVE Cable TV subscription that I have had for over 20 years. Got tired of them CONSTANTLY RAISING PRICES, and not getting very much in return, as I didn’t watch that many channels. So, I hooked up this antenna, and I’m VERY PLEASED with the results! I’m about 25 miles from all the local stations here in Oklahoma City, and they ALL come through very clearly! And, your antenna was very reasonably priced. Just as advertised! D.",5,1,2020-9-4,1,1,0

I bought this antenna for my husband's birthday in July. The hope was just to use this antenna and Amazon Prime and get rid of cable.Our son- in- law just hooked it up two weeks ago.To my surprise it worked great! Really great.

"First antenna since the switch to digital several years back.  I'm pretty impressed.  All of the major stations in LA have sister stations and many of them air vintage TV shows. But the cable provider doesn't offer one of my favorites.  So this is a great alternative.  I was still not getting clear reception of some channels. I found that if i flipped it around, some would come thru.  It works best on my balcony so i wish the cable was slimmer to fit thru the door.  But that's pretty much my only complaint.  I have a huge sliding glass door in the living room, no windows. And it's currently working best on the floor next to the door.",4,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
After cutting the cord I was wondering what to do to at least watch all the local channels so I research and came across this one. After taking it out of the package reading the easy instructions this 67-year-old woman had installed the antenna that brought in picture quality you would have thought I had cable again. I receive over 50 free channels!,5,1,2020-2-27,1,1,0
"This is the HDTV antenna I was looking for to provide local channels including news, entertainment, and even some radio stations. I am amazed at the picture clarity with a 77” television.

Very great! Works exactly as described! I live in Jacksonville FL and get 30-40 channels. Comcast wanted an extra $50 a month for just 10 channels.This streams perfect with no glitches or anything. I have a Samsung 4K and I’m the picture quality is great. 100% worth the price!,5,1,2020-4-23,1,1,0
I've been having problems getting certain local channels in my hometown so I went onto Amazon and purchased your amplified HD digital TV antenna. I no longer have any problems getting channels and don't have to move this antenna around the room to the perfect location to get channels. I'm very impressed with this antenna!

"This antenna was supposed to enable us to ""cut the cord"" from cable TV.  However, after carefully following instructions for installation, and then for different placements for best reception, I never could receive local stations.  Many of the stations I was able to receive had poor reception, with a lot of pixilization.  I finally gave up, and went back to cable.",2,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0

This antenna is amazing. So very easy to set up and picture quality is excellent. The antenna worked virtually anywhere in my bedroom. Channel selection was just what I wanted. Great value.,5,1,2020-5-17,1,2,0
The antenna is pretty good. I am able to get channels that I normally wouldn't get without paying. I can watch football for free instead of going to an app and pay for it or keep watching the news to see updates of the score. My only complaint is when I scan my channels with the antenna and come back another day it would have bad signal. Other than that the antenna is great.,5,1,2020-3-14,1,1,0
"They offer you a free 2nd antenna for a good review, which I declined. The main stations I want are about 40 miles west of town, but this antenna only gets them once in a while. All the other stations are about 55 miles northeast, and this antenna almost never gets those. Pretty much a waste of money for me. Might work for you if you're closer to the broadcasting towers.",2,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"We live about 35 miles east of Columbus,  Ga in a small heavily wooded valley. We had a cheaper version previously and received about 6 channels.

Installation was easy, took more time getting ladder in position and climbing it.",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"My experience has been one of great relief to be able to drop my cable tv subscription and use this antenna instead. It was easy to install and is nicely picking up some local stations that allow us to watch the news.. We were most hoping to pick up our local PBS station, which we have not been able to do with any consistency. However, I just ordered an extension coaxial cable and will put the antenna in a window that faces the recommended direction for my geographic area. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. It was affordable and helps us save lots of money each month that we were wasting on Cable TV.",5,1,2020-4-25,1,1,0
"Perfect! I ordered this because I wanted to watch football this season and the old antenna I had bought was only picking up about 5 channels. I got the package, opened it up and in about 5 minutes I had over 50 channels! Couldn’t be happier with the immediate results. The picture quality is great and clear and everything I would want out of my tv watching experience. Totally ready for football now!",5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
I read reviews and really based my decision on selecting this antenna on trust.  It was rather easy to attach to antenna port just need to remember to switch tv to antenna mode.  I live close to a foreign country border so I picked up a few of their channels too.  My suggestion is once you find a spot for the antenna leave it alone.  Im very happy to have my locals back and recommend this product to others.,5,1,2020-3-21,1,1,0
"I live 61 miles from the furthest local channels, therefor I purchased the amplified version with a range of 120 miles in hopes to pull in the 4 local network channels. I have moved this antenna all over the room, in windows, outside of windows on the bed etc. It will only find the local CBS channel 5 when the antenna is laying flat on the bed. Very disappointed with this antenna's range as it obviously is nowhere near capable of receiving signal from just 60 miles away. I'm  still trying to find a solution or deciding if I want to keep this at all. The good is that the when it does get signal the picture is very good.",2,1,2020-2-17,1,0,0
I ordered this one on Amazon based on the reviews and it certainly has lived up to expectations. It replaced a similar one I bought several years ago on Amazon and the results are amazing. I had to drape the wire for the old antenna across the room and mount it on a window far away to get mediocre reception. My new one is mounted just above the TV and pulls in more stations with no fuzzy picture at all. Thanks.,5,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0
"Hi,Bought your antenna and it works great. Before when anyone would get up or walk in front of the TV we would lose the pic and or sound.  It is nice to finally be able to watch CBS and/or NBC stations without interruption.

Nice slim design.",5,1,2020-7-4,1,1,0

"We ordered this product for our Guest Room as we do not have DirecTV there.  We have been using rabbit ear type digital antenna, but it is so bulky and has to be moved to pick up different local channels.

I occasionally missed watching local news or sports, but never found a streaming service that had what I wanted AND didn't cost nearly as much as cable. I don't know why I never thought about an antenna, but I did some research and ended up buying this one. I tried it in a few places, and it gave a different number of channels each location I tried. The best spot ended up being on the wall behind the TV so it isn't even visible. I live right between 2 large cities, so now I have 55 channels to watch! Very happy with the product.",5,1,2020-2-4,1,1,0

It is a place for me to hang out and do all my craft things with my grandchildren, as well as hang out with family and friends in a relaxed environment.

I thought this was a good purchase made because I was getting rid of the costly cable service in the home.  It was a snap to install and gives a clear picture.  Due to our location the TV scanned and located 30+ channels which is good for local stations and some others.  In the future we will be adding perhaps a firestick or roku to have a bit more variety for entertainment.  This is a nice antenna and was a great purchase.,5,1,2020-1-31,1,1,0
"This has to be the best OTA antenna I have ever had. Very discreet yet powerful. It is hidden behind my wall mounted television. Can’t even tell it is there.

Fantastic antenna for a great price.",5,1,2020-4-17,1,1,0

"Our family cut our Directv Service from 3 different homes and I bought this Antenna hoping to get all the channels I usually watch. So far, it works perfectly. Comes in clear just like with cable and/or satellite.  Also the long cord was great as I had to put it closer to a window. Couldn't be happier.

I picked up all 23 channels that were in my area- and 3 that were not mentioned. It took some to figure out the best spot...I just taped it to a spot and then ran the auto channel scan and moved it around a couple times too I got it what I picked up the most channels.,5,1,2020-2-14,1,1,0
"Thanks you for this great product.  Most antennas similar to this have a 60 mile range.  We live out in the country right in between the two major broadcast areas and the signals we receive using other antennas were very poor or not at all.

The antenna was a quarter of the size I thought it would be and is easy to mount in an inconspicuous place.  Overall, 5 out of 5 stars",5,1,2020-2-25,1,1,0

I was able to get a couple of local channels since we’re I live is hard to get all of them. My only problem was that the antenna fell of the wall all the time. So therefore I use some Velcro that was magic. It hasn’t move since then. Overall I am satisfied. I would recommended.,5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,1

I didn't find any.  I set my receiver up on a closet shelf.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,1,0
This antenna works perfectly. Easy to install and the picture quality is sharp hd. It also has a feature to rewind and pause live TV with you antenna and a memory stick. Great product I recommend you buy and try.,5,1,2020-8-23,1,1,1
Tuner cane well packed with fast delivery. I plugged it in and got a fair amount of channels with great video quality. Recently moved to suburbs away from the city and still get a decent amount of channels. I’ve used plenty of antennas in the past like Terk and Mohu but this one has been my favorite since it’s sleek and also amplified through a USB connection. Definitely recommend since it’s also the cheapest.,5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
For the past year I have only been getting about 15 channels. The channels have been skipping and you could barely watch TV. After buying this antenna I now get 38 channels that are crisp and clear. The only time it will skip is during a really bad storm. Best antenna I have used. Super easy to set up. I live in a rural area with lots of trees but it doesn't interfere with the reception. Amazing antenna for the price.,5,1,2020-5-26,1,1,0
"I have been through Many HDTV antenna this one works well, as living in an area where it is difficult to receive signals specially from an indoor antenna, this one did the job, I have had exterior antennas that didn't work as well, worth every penny",5,1,2020-3-16,1,1,0
"I installed he hdtv antenna after cutting my cable subscription. It does exactly what I wanted, it pulls in some local channels for me to watch some local news and entertainment channels.Setup was easy and documentation was clear, I was done after 10 minutes. I wish the antenna cable was a bit longer so I could have placed it in a better position to receive a better signal and to ensure even better picture quality.  But overall for the price I paid I am very happy, it does what it promised and it met my expectations.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0

"I was impressed by the ease of installation and the picture quality. Due to limitations to get a drop to another TV, based on the signal and picture quality we decided to purchase another one for that location rather than attempting to run a hard wire to connect to the original one. We were able to conceal the antennae out of sight without sacrificing picture quality.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,1,0
"This is an AMAZING product! It took less than 10 minutes to set up and provides a perfect picture. It has replaced traditional cable for me and gives me 58 channels. You will need to figure out where your closest broadcast tower is located in your town, but I am 19 miles from mine and I get a perfect signal. I am definitely going to be buying a couple more of these.",5,1,2020-3-16,1,1,0
"We live on the distant fringe area for coverage for our local television stations and I was honestly skeptical that this would work.  IT DOES!  AND IT WORKS EXTREMELY WELL.

Followed the easy to follow instructions for hook up, scanned the TV for available channels took about 5 minutes and once the scan was done we were in business with 30 something channels. All came in clear and in some cases better then cable… Not just saying this because you are offering a free second antenna, which I’ll be hooking up to the other TV and saying good-bye the cable all together.

"I would like to share my experience with my HDTV antenna. I have been wanting to get away from the ever rising cost of cable tv ,but I was really unsure how the l quality of the channels would be on the HDTV antenna. After looking at the reviews online for this one, I decided to try it out. We hooked it up and did the channel scan. I can honestly say it was a very good purchase. The channels come in great! More channels than I thought we would get!  On occasion we have to move the antenna up a little because of some kind of interference . Great purchase! Great price!  I am saving at least 135.00 monthly.",5,1,2020-4-2,1,1,0
"I had an antenna that looked just like this with a 75 mile range. When I saw that this had a 200 mile range, I bought it. I thought I would get more channels but I actually got less.

"I saved more than $150 per month when I dropped by Cable TV provider and switched to Roku to stream TV & movies. And I purchased the Digital HDTV Antenna so I could get local TV.

So I turned the antenna 90 degrees and put it on another wall, and scanned again.  This time I got all the channels I wanted.  So easy!!  I’m using my HD antenna with a Tablo DVR for recording over the air signals.  The recordings are crisp and bright, in some cases as good as our wireless internet pictures.

"This antenna has to be flat mounted and if your wall/window/door  is not perpendicular to your target area you could have a problem.  It is also designed to hang from the top, no bottom support at all.  I am a woodworker and I solved this problem by using my table saw to make a shallow saw kerf in a piece of scrap pine.  The bottom edge of the antenna sits in this groove and the unit stands upright and of course can be turned 360 degrees.  With this done the unit gets a near perfect picture on our 10yr old tv and it pick up 25 channels, we love it !!",4,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0

I live in a semi rural and very hilly  area about 35 miles north of Boston and would have been thrilled if it received a half dozen network stations. I put it up on a wall facing Boston and scanned for channels. This antenna now is pulling in over 40 stations and will save me lots of money on my cable bill. It's not often today that you buy something that far, far exceeds expectations. Your product did that and was super easy to install. Thanks for making a great product.",5,1,2019-11-28,1,1,0

I thought, from looking at fooltv I would only get around 8 channels, I ended up getting 20. I was really surprised to get fox, that channel is 60 miles away. I did move the antenna around to find the best possible signal, for me it was above the window. I seriously couldn't be more happy with my purchase.

This is much better than a GE antenna I tried before, which allowed reception of only 2 channels.Although the 18-foot cable is among the longest I saw among such antennas on Amazon, I did have to use an extension coaxial cable and a cable connector in order to reach the nearest window for mounting the antenna. I don't know if there is a better solution or a recommended cable and connector I should be looking for. I'm also wondering if it's possible to mount two such antennas side by side on the same window or wall, or if they would interfere with each other.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"Great Antenna, very low profile. Take your time and find the sweet spot to get the most channels and smoothest picture. You can put the antenna behind your TV or on your wall.

"I live within 20 miles of several towers and in an extremely strong signal area. I also have a background in computer science and engineering. After the antenna only picked up a few distant channels and several hours of troubleshooting, it didn’t work. It for two channels that had video and 8 that didn’t come in, all foreign and non local. After testing the range of the receiver with external tools, it does not have 120 mile range. Bring your business elsewhere. It is possible my models is defective, however, the lack of care and packaging suggested it was reused sold as new in the first place. I am skeptical and just requested my money back. I am going to take my money elsewhere.",1,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0

Product did what they said it would . Brought in 23 plus channels in a heavily foliaged area of my yard for my camper. I was reluctant to buy not knowing about them but it was worth every penny. I would recommend them to any one. Cant wait to get it to campsite where it's more open.,5,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0

"This antenna is really versatile in that it can be placed in so many different locations/positions. It is attached to back of a tv in order to be more discrete (north jersey) and the reception is still excellent. The great thing is that depending on the smart tv platform you are using, you'll get live channel guides and the ability to pause live tv (roku). It is such a small investment, but really long term value. Great companion to streaming apps. Note that depending on where you live, it may not work at all, so please do some research online.",5,1,2020-2-22,1,1,1
When I got the first one after hooking it up it work for about five minutes and then could no longer receive a signal. I tried re-hooking it back up changing the frequency settings and waving it around the windows of the house for about an hour before I gave up. I believe I got a defective one because it worked great in the never worked again. So I sent it back and got the new one. This one worked pretty well except for every time a car passed outside the signal would get lost or if somebody walked by it. After about two weeks this one started acting funny. This just seems like a crappy antenna.,2,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
Great picture and found more channels than any of my other antennas I’ve used before.  The cord connected to the antenna is not a coaxial cable and is permanently fixed. The coaxial connection comes out of the amplifier so I would make sure the cord length is appropriate as you cannot choose a shorter/longer cord without maybe using a splitter. Cord length is plenty for my needs.,5,1,2020-9-13,1,1,0

"This is a fantastic product. It was very easy to assemble and hook up to the tv. I immediately got many, crystal clear local channels that I wasn't getting through my streaming set up.

Horrible reception.  Do not buy this antenna. I can't even pick up local networks within 50 miles of my house.  It is very cheaply made with cheap thin coax cable and fitting.I tried the antenna in different locations including a window on an outside wall and still very poor reception. I will be returning this product today. Don't waste your time or money.,1,1,2020-4-1,1,1,0

I wish this product had been better advertised as I would have purchased an antenna much earlier! I highly recommend this product.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,1

This Ultra-Thin HDTV antenna is the best that I have tried.  I also have a traditional HDTV Rabbitt Ears that doesn't work very well and another brand of thin HDTV antenna that works a little better.  The Ultra-thin HDTV works the best by far.

So glad that I purchased it thru Amazon.,5,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0

I get about 200 more channels than cable and for a mere $10 a month, I get The Disney/ESPN package - all I need in life.

"This antenna is the best alternative I could find now that I got rid of cable. I think that I have about 60 channels right now which is great, and now they come in clear. I get pretty much every channel there is that’s not on cable. Sometimes I have to rescan for a few missed channels. Thanks so much!Sarah",5,1,2020-7-20,1,2,0
"We recently cut the""cable"" and went to streaming and Digital HAD Broadcast TV.  In order to facilitate this we purchased the Gesobyte Amplified HD Digital Antenna. Installation took less then 5 minutes and the picture quality is on par with anything cable can offer. We are quite pleased with our purchase .  Why only 4 out of 5 stars ?  There was oneo downside we found , we are unable to pick up the local PBS station due to weak signal strength.  But outdside of that we are completely satisfied with the product.",4,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
I purchased a HDTV antenna with amplifier and it works great. The hook up/installation was very easy. The picture is clear. I am receiving  a lot more channels for viewing than with my former cable service and cost much less. The price of the antenna is very economical. I  will definitely purchase another antenna and tell family and friends that they should consider making a purchase as well.I am completely satisfied with your product.,5,1,2020-2-14,1,1,0
We just purchased and received our new antenna.  We live at the lake and our acreage has lots of tall trees.  It's hard for us to get good reception here and after doing away with Dish we were only getting 22 channels and on several the reception was iffy.We plugged the antenna in and we got over 40+ channels and no in and out reception.  We are happy with the antenna so far.,5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
I received my HDTV Antenna today; I am very impressed with the quality and the ease that it installed. I had to do a little adjusting for the location to receive the best signal. Once I got it adjusted and searched for local channels it works great.,5,1,2020-8-1,1,1,0
"The antenna worked great for what I needed.  I am in the Kansas City downtown area, so most of the broadcast stations are reasonably close.  The antenna picked up all the local broadcast stations with clarity from inside our office building.  I was not able to pick up Topeka stations, so the antenna does not reach 120 miles from my non-ideal mounting location.  However, it does what I need, so I am keeping it relatively hidden rather than putting it at a more visible location which might pick up more distant channels..",5,1,2020-2-6,1,1,0
"I was watching tv the other night and right at the crucial part of my show's ending the picture and sound went out again 😡because the antenna I had wasn't working. My tv is down stairs and gets poor service. I was so frustrated I got my phone, read some reviews on amplified HD TV antennas. I found the GB, ordered it, overnight delivery from Amazon. It was very easy to install, and I am ecstatic!!!😀 All my channels are coming in clear, no static, no glitches!!! Thank you!!! Thank you!! 😀😘 Kim Frazier",5,1,2020-9-7,1,1,0
We have installed the antenna on a TV located in our lower level.  Even with three walls being concrete we are still able to receive 8 stations which is surprising.  That was unexpected since we also live in the country quite far from any transmitters.  We cannot even receive cell phone service.,5,1,2020-4-30,1,1,0
"I installed this in the living room of my house. I was some what hesitant about using an antenna, thinking of the picture quality from the old rabbit ear ones. Ordered the product and received within just a few days. Install was a breeze, took maybe 5 min. I scan for the channels and surprisingly I have over 50 channels. The picture quality of great, my wife and kiddos can’t tell the difference from a dvd to the antenna. I must say I am pleasantly pleased, I’ve already recommended this to several people.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,1,0
"Depending on where I hang the antenna, I can get up to 35 stations with excellent reception quality.  My only complaint is that although I get CBS, NBC, and Fox, among others,so far I have been unable to get ABC in my location (25 mile north of Philly).",4,1,2020-1-6,1,1,0
"I recently purchased two hdtv Antennas because we were sick and tired of these overpriced cable bills every month. I searched through amazon and came across this hdtv antenna for a very affordable price, shipping was very fast and efficient.The setup was very simple it took me less than 10 minutes to set up both antennas. Instructions were easy to understand. The picture quality is beyond amazing! Super clear and no interference.  We are very pleased with this purchase",5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
I recently purchased this antenna for a secondary TV in my home.  Upon installation I found that I now have at least 37 channels as opposed to 19 with the Clear Channel  antenna.  I am very pleased with the quality of the channels that come in as they are much clearer and do not go in and out.  The wiring to this antenna is much less conspicuous that the Clear Channel antenna.  I would highly recommend this antenna if you are cutting the cord to cable as it picks up local broadcast stations and more very well.,5,1,2020-6-21,1,1,0
"I got this to put in my guest bedroom, which sees visitors once or twice a year. I wanted my guests to have access to tv without paying for more cable. This was a great answer for about $30. It was simple to set up and I was able to move it a few times to see where I got the best reception. I get most of the major channels very clearly - NBC, CBS, FOX, ION and about 25 others that offer some variety. I will probably try some other placements to see if I can get ABC and PBS.",4,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0
This is a great antenna for the price. It has a really good range of over 100 miles so that I can get all of the local channels that I need. I would recommend this product to anyone needing an antenna for any room in their home.,5,1,2020-3-26,1,1,0
"This antenna was quick and easy to install, and it is working great. We did not even need the optional amplifier; our television broadcast towers are 15-20 miles away. The reception is very clear, and we are able to receive all available free channels. We are very pleased.",5,1,2019-11-13,1,1,1
"This antenna was as advertised and more. I opened it (minimal packaging which I appreciate) and had it hooked up to my 12 year old tv with in 3-4 minutes. I wasn’t sure about air scan or digital scan so I did both. After I figured out that I needed air scan the channels were loaded with in 2-3 minutes. I had an antenna of a different brand on another tv and it does not get near as many channels is this one does.  Clearly the range is much better on this new antenna and I didn’t have to put it in a window. Last, but not least, this antenna was $8.00 less than my original antenna!",5,1,2020-2-17,1,1,0
This antenna has a great picture and was very easy to install.  I like how it can be powered through the TV via USB port eliminating extra dangling cords.  I now can receive 54 channels.  Highly recommend.,5,1,2020-5-15,1,1,0
We are cutting the cord in both homes.  We got one of these free with a subscription to one of the services we use now s and bought this one  and 3 more of the more expensive ones.  These work MUCH better than the ones we spent almost twice as much on.,5,1,2019-12-29,1,1,0
"Love this antenna.  It is so easy to set up, and I played with it a little in different positions to get the most channels.  Why didn't I do this years ago instead of getting taken to the cleaners by Spectrum!!  Worth every penny!",5,1,2020-4-1,1,1,0
I received the antenna today. I attached it to the roof on the second floor of my house and I was able to get 52 channels!!! My old antenna only picked up 5 or 6 channels. The picture is amazing!!! 10 out of 10 would recommend to a friend!!!,5,1,2020-9-13,1,1,0

"We had an older TV antenna and were not able to get most local channels and some were not very clear. When I installed the new antenna in the attic, plugged it into the TV we got all but the PBS station which is running on low power and our location quite difficult to receive their signal. All the other stations come in strong and clear. I watched football this weekend and was amazed of the clarity and picture quality. I love this new antenna and recommend anyone looking for an antenna to this great antenna.",5,1,2019-11-25,1,1,0
"I purchased the GESOBYTE Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna Long 200+, Miles Range, from Amazon, and of course, it was here in 1 day! The setup of my digital antenna was super easy and I was able to watch HD TV in a matter of minutes. I moved the antenna a couple of places to get the best signal and was able to get a lot of channels quickly. Thank you for such a great product and I am so glad I do not have to rely on satellite or Netflix.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
"After thorough research, the antenna was chosen for its description and I was not disappointed.  It was delivered with excellent instructions on how to install and set up to the TV.  It was very easy to understand and was installed within a very short time and the picture quality is excellent.  It is installed on our window for the bedroom TV.  I would highly recommend this item to my friends.",5,1,2020-4-10,1,0,0
"We recently bought a fixer upper and we are currently renting until our house is ready.  Because of this, we decided not to purchase cable for just a temporary situation.  We purchased this antenna because it was reasonably priced and had really good reviews.  I can honestly say, that after using this, we love it!  No need for cable in the future.  We get most Atlanta stations and even some Chattanooga station.  We receive a very clear pictures.  It’s a great product at a great price.",5,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"We just installed our new HDTV Antenna and absolutely love it. First we try it right next to TV in our downstairs home and got good amount of channels including FOX, CBS, NBC but ABC was missing. Then we we followed the manufacturers recommendation: higher the better, so we installed it in our attic and boy we almost doubled our channels. We got ABC !. The picture is so clear, do I dare to say even better than our cable. We look forward to canceling our TV provider and watching more local channels.Thanks for a great product!",5,1,2020-6-20,1,1,0
"I installed this antenna at an apartment complex that does not have cable TV any longer and residents had to find an alternative. From a standard antenna, we only received 6 channels and they were not that great. After installing this antenna, we now get 22+ channels and they are crystal clear!",5,1,2020-6-3,1,1,0
"This thing sucks. It’s inexpensive so I’m not really upset but my $5 antenna gets better reception than this. This thing struggles to get local channels. As of right now I can only pick up 2 local channels and to top it off, it constantly drops signal.",1,1,2020-4-22,1,1,0
"This antenna was very easy to put together and install, even if you’re not tech savvy. I am a senior citizen and a female, but did it all by myself. It has a great picture and allows me to get my local channels without being a cable subscriber. I love it!",5,1,2020-2-15,1,1,0
"Great antenna. I unboxed the antenna, connected the cable to my TV, connected the power cord, and put the antenna in the window. Then I switched my TV to ‘antenna’ mode, went to ‘Setup’ on my TV and scanned for stations. I got perfect reception on over 40 channels.That is all there is to it.",5,1,2020-8-15,1,1,0
"Hooked it up today.  It was very easy. To be honest,  I wasn't expecting much.  I scanned the channel's and it picked up 44 channels. When i went through the channel's only about 30 channels were watchable. I am happy with this product.",5,1,2020-2-23,1,1,0
"It took a little fiddling with the TV to get it figured out, but once I got it all right, I ended up with at least 40 channels!  All I really wanted was the news, but I got quite a bit more!",5,1,2020-6-18,1,1,0
"Just got my HDTV antenna and I am thrilled with it! I have to admit, my expectations were very low when I purchased it since I've tried a few other brands of which I ended up returning. But the quality is excellent, far better than what I expected!After cutting the cable years ago, I haven't watched much TV since. Now I'm so happy that I can get dozens of channels - FOR FREE! News, sports, tv series etc. It almost seems too good to be true, especially for the price and ease of setup.",5,1,2020-2-18,1,1,0
"I like everything about it. Fast delivery, very easy to set up and works PERFECT.  Out of the box  it only took 5 minutes to set up. Then set the TV to auto select channels and within minutes BOOM!!  Perfect, crystal clear, over 50 HD channels. I was AMAZED!.  The best thing about it....Now I can ""Cut The Cord"" and stop paying my cable bill. True Free TV!!!",5,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0
"After having the antenna for a while now I can truly say that I am very pleased with the purchase. Had I known over a year ago how convenient and reliable digital antenna's are, I would have purchased one months ago. I recently cancelled my cable services and can still receive over 50 channels using the U Must Have digital antenna. The setup was very fast and for me the best signal is having it mounted on the window. All air and cable channels come in pretty clear and I am not seeing any issues so far.",5,1,2020-1-17,1,1,0
My new Amplified HR Digital TV Antenna works as advertised and more. I am able to receive over eighty (80) DTV channels. I was able to cut the cable cord and save over $100 dollars a month. I highly suggest placing the antenna on a window for best results.,5,1,2020-8-25,1,1,1
"Unfortunately, I bought two of these receivers, thinking that their ""150-mile"" reception would outperform the the 50-mile receivers that I purchased from K-Mart three years ago. Big mistake. After having used them for several weeks I can unqualifiedly say that both manage to pick up fewer channels than either of my old receivers......as in 1/3 as many channels, including the local NBC, FOX and PBS stations [which are pumping out more watts than most others.]",1,1,2019-12-21,1,1,0
Couldn;t believe that there was over 57 over the air stations available in my area.  i narrowed it down to about 37 channels that I would like to watch.  Works as good as cable.,5,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0

"I live in a valley right in the lowest part. I’ve tired every antenna that said the y would work. Oh they worked alright with me being the antenna adjuster all over. We recently decided to drop cable and switch to other means on my fire stick. But no local channels. I read about this antenna and thought I’d give it a try. To my amazement I have 30 channels!!!! ABC, NBC, and CBS, and many other channels! I’m extremely happy and highly recommend this to anyone!",5,1,2019-11-10,1,1,0
"I am very happy with this antenna, it works great, super clear HD picture. It took about five minutes to set up,just follow the directions. For the first time in 30 years I have finally gotten rid of cable. I do stream some but with all the channels I’m getting with this antenna I watch shows with it about 90% of the time. The price was very good too",5,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0
Going from cable to Antenna wasn’t an easy choice and I was hesitant thinking that the channels and picture quality wouldn’t be the same. To my surprise this Antenna has exceeded my expectations. Many channels available and extremely clear.  It’s an extremely cloudy day today and the picture quality is still very nice.,5,1,2020-3-25,1,1,0
First time buying a tv antenna. Bought it for my 76 year old mom to give her basic channels. It was super easy to install and surprisingly we were able to get over 30 channels! Highly recommend this product if looking for free tv.,5,1,2020-3-25,1,1,0
I’m very pleased with the antenna. I can now get all local channels without having to readjust each time or worry about bumping it and having to relocate the channel. It is only occasionally affected by strong winds. It was very easy to connect and put up.,5,1,2020-1-2,1,1,0
"I should have done this a couple of years ago!  The quality is super sharp--it really does look HD.  Easy to hook up (especially because I was already using a lower-grade digital antenna).  Nice, long cord.  I highly recommend this product!",5,1,2020-2-21,1,1,0
Overall i get great quality pictures and about 30 channels or so. The only thing i would like is to have a bigger sticker to stick the antenna easier on the wall so it stays up without falling.Update: after awhile we started losing fox 8. But channel 5 (abc) was pretty clear. Now we cannot get a signal on either channel. Seems like the antenna quality is not good and it phases out overtime.,1,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0
"I have installed three antennas around the house and we are receiving upwards of 36 channels including all major networks, local channels and PBS. Overall a very good product save a couple of issues with the RF connector to the antenna and amplifiers. The solder joint came free on the ground plane for one antenna and two amplifiers. Tried to reflow the solder for the antenna and it didn't work. It did work for the two amplifiers. May need to re-engineer your soldering method. Thanks so much.",4,1,2020-5-18,1,1,0
"We purchased this antenna when we decided to cancel our DISH subscription. To be completely transparent, we purchased through Amazon so that when it didn't work, we could return it. Our home is in the country and we haven't had great luck with over the air channels.  An outdoor antenna was recommended, but we're trying to avoid it if possible. We were shockingly surprised with how well this antenna worked. We probably should still get an outdoor antenna for better reception, but this little unit gets us plenty of channels unless there's a storm in the area.",4,1,2020-4-8,1,1,0
"Pretty easy setup!  When channel comes in the picture is perfect.  (Signal strength better at night, but that’s what my neighbors say is normal, so it’s not the ‘U Must Have Antenna’).  Would recommend.",5,1,2020-6-4,1,1,0
I received my antenna early December and am not disappointed.   I really like the long cable.  I live in a small rural town and it can be difficult at times to get certain channels.   Being able to move the antenna to different areas makes it easier to get the channels.,5,1,2020-2-2,1,1,0
"I received my antenna as a gift from my daughter on Tuesday, 5/12/20. I have tried the antenna on both of my sets and the reception is excellent. In addition, I am receiving more channels than I ever expected considering that there is a tree line on the side and a field with a treeline behind my home. The best part is the cost of the antenna is a real bargain.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,1,0
"My experience to date with this brand of Ultra-Thin 2020 HDTV Antenna.  As this is the third one I have purchased 2 for the house and one for the office tv.  Haven't been able to pull in any ESPN channels yet, but each antenna has over 20+ total channels on each tv.They seem pretty solid and good so far, once two I purchased just before Christmas, and just got this third one, second one fro home.  Great powered Antenna for the cost!",5,1,2020-3-26,1,1,0

"I just bought your antenna I am very impressed by the receptivity that it has. I tried it first in the room close to the window and of course it worked perfectly but then I tried it in the kitchen with no windows (and I was very hesitant!) but I can watch all the channels very clearly and with no problem.Easy to install, no hassle.",5,1,2020-5-14,1,1,0
Best purchase made for this item.  Didn't realize so many free channels readily available.  Picture is perfect.Finally breaking that cable dependency where local channels is concerned and beyond,5,1,2020-7-30,1,1,0
"I've tried a couple different, pricier antennas with ""special functions"" and they were all very sensitive to location and surrounding objects.  This antenna had no trouble getting reception and the extra long power and antenna cables made mounting in a optimum location quick and easy.",5,1,2019-12-17,1,1,0

"I've been a slave to cable/satellite for years but recently took the plunge and bought one of these Gesobite amplified HDTV antennas to see what it could do.  It arrived quickly, was super easy to set up and the picture is awesome...tons of channels too.  I liked it so much I bought two more for my mother.  Her Dish recently stopped airing ABC so she was elated to be able to watch it for free in high def.  Definitely recommend the Gesobite products!",5,1,2020-9-17,1,1,0
"I used to only get 24 channels with my old antenna and a lot of the time I never got a clear picture or the sound was never right. With my new HDTV antenna I get 67 channels and they are all perfectly clear! I can't believe it! I would recommend this antenna to anyone, it is by far the best. I'm so excited that I can actually flip through the channels now and know that anything I want to watch will be perfectly clear! Thank you!",5,1,2020-4-19,1,1,0
It works as advertised.  I normally get 35-40 channels with other antennas. I ran channel scan and I got a whopping 52. The picture quality is great.  I couldn't be happier.,5,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0

"Purchased two of these to be installed on secondary TVs to receive the major network channels (e.g. NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX) and it accomplished exactly what was needed!  The big plus is the ease of setup (in minutes) and HD quality with the local area channels is very good.  It was especially helpful that these antennas can be placed on the interior wall of house and they pickup channels just fine.",5,1,2020-8-26,1,1,0

"I just received my new Gesobyte HDTV from Amazon. This antenna is outstanding and definitely an upgrade over all of the previous HDTV antennas I have purchased in the past. With this product, I was able to pick up at over 60 channels in the Dallas Fort Worth area. In fact, I had never been able to pick the ABC affiliate (WFAA) before in my downstairs den and now that channel and several others that had poor reception before are coming in clearly. Great job on this product!",5,1,2020-8-1,1,1,0
"So far the HD antenna has been great. I previously had a different brand and it could not get some local channels that I normally have. Even when I move the antenna into a different location and rescan, several channels could not be found. Static and screen tearing happened a lot too. As soon as I scanned with the Gesobyte HD antenna, it found all my local channels and it looked nice and crisp. There were no static or tearing. Its been a great upgrade from my previous antenna.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0

Plus was same price as the junk I got from Walmart!!!!,5,1,2020-2-23,1,1,0

This antenna beats our old digital antenna with rabbit ears by a mile. Picture quality is excellent and the flat panel design allows it to be placed almost anywhere in the room courtesy of the extra long connecting wire. Plus there’s no unsightly rabbit ears. It could not be easier to install.,5,1,2020-5-21,1,1,0

I have been using an old Leaf Antenna from Mohu which is a good product but the Gesobyte enable me to get more channels 44 compared to 30 .

First to start off by saying this is super easy to install and the picture quality and range are great..my only dificulty was because my television did not have an accessible usb port and i was not using a digital reciever i had to improvise to make the cord long enough to plug in...this is only because of the model  of my TV and the location. the product is great...though slightly over priced hence 4 stars.,5,1,2020-5-3,1,1,0
We installed this and had 50 new channels in under 5 minutes. I was really amazed at the picture quality and ease of use. I highly recommend this over the old school rabbit ears. Plus it works much better.,5,1,2020-5-24,1,1,0

"I had researched best TV antennas for the money and was happy to find that Amazon sold the one that seemed to be best for my needs.  It was very easy to install - I hung my antenna high on an outside wall and so far have 32 channels and all of the network channels.  After leaving cable a few months ago, I found that I missed network stations.  I now have them and a lot more!  I highly recommend this antenna.",5,1,2020-5-2,1,1,0
"I have moved the antenna 3-4 times for better results but wherever I move it to I keep losing channels off and on. I bought it because I stopped my cable service, but can't seem to count on even local channels coming in. One day I have a clear channel the next it doesn't even come in. My son has a cheaper antenna from a well known store and he has no problem, maybe will get the same, tired of running a channel scan.",2,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"Very easy to install, just stick it on and you're done, using it with HDHomeRun Quatro Scribe DVR, works fantastic. One lesson learned, even though it recommends to mount on a window - if you have Pella windows or similar with built-in metal blinds, these blinds kill the signal, rather mount it next to it on the wall.",5,1,2020-1-22,1,1,0
"What delightfully surprised at the volume of content that is available over the air for FREE.  Reminds me of living in the 80s where having an antenna was a very common household thing.  However, there is no bulky antenna to install on your roof and wires to drop to each room.  Bought the Digital HDTV Antenna and installed it in 20-mins or less.  The antenna is flat like a sheet of paper and is white or black to best match your preferred location.  Mine is on the side of my bookcase nearest a window where it is out of sight.  Hope you enjoy your HDTV antenna as much as I do!",5,1,2020-3-11,1,1,1

I tried other antennas that cost more than the GB antenna. The GB antenna worked twice as good as the more expensive ones. It provides double the number of clear HD channels. Buy it you will be satisfied with it..  5 🌟,5,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0
I just purchased this HDTV antenna and it has been the best choice. The installation was super easy. You don't need any tools to set it up on your wall.

I would definitely purchase again.,5,1,2020-3-25,1,1,0

Thank you for producing an HD TV antenna that works and pulls in most of my local channels in beautiful HD crisp and clear colors.  This is exactly what I need to get rid of COMCAST and save a lot of money each year.,5,1,2020-3-19,1,1,0
"My experience with the antenna has been excellent. I installed a new TV the same day I installed the antenna and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was! I discovered that having it by the window is definitely better than having it away from one and was able to find about 50 channels.The cord was more than long enough to reach from the tv to the window and even line along the edges, so the cord isn’t in the way.",5,1,2020-3-15,1,1,0

"Easy to install. Surprised at the thinness of the product; you use sticky pads to attach to wall, which has made me reluctant to move it. We came up short a couple major channels after rescanning with this. Though it has 18’ of wire, we need to extend even further to get to a window. So, we will continue to work with it. 4 stars ‘cuz it hasn’t done all we need. To be continued...",4,1,2020-9-6,1,0,0

I am pleasantly surprised with the new antenna, the channels that I had problems with before and now with very clear pictures.I am very pleased with the quality of the product and its performance.  Five stars.  I would recommend this to a friend.",5,1,2020-3-22,1,1,0
"It was my first experience in using an hdtvantenna, and let me tell you, after adjusting just a couple of times it is now situated near a ceiling, not even a window (across from my sliding door, and all of the stations it picks up are either crystal clear or near it--HD quality. The instructions are literally only 3 steps, and then it is just finding the right place to put it where all of your main channels (fox, abc, nbc, cbs) come in clear with a few others like ion and bounce that were nice additions, among others. I did see a kids/cartoon channel as well, among others.  Now I have the chance to cancel my subscription for my cable--so purchasing this will not let you down--I would check the signal strength from the towers--perhaps if you were out too far--but I saw that this particular model's range was top of the line when it comes to these things. I am very happy with this product and would recommend to others.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
"I choose this antenna because of the top rating on amazon and I'm glad I did. My last antenna was only able to pick up one channel and that was on a sunny clear day. The day I received the antenna it was stormy but I still choose to try it out and I was able to pick up 16 channels after my initial placement and one channel scan. I live in a log cabin that doesn't have great reception and 30+ miles from all the receivers, so glad I choose this antenna!",5,1,2020-2-17,1,1,0

Very easy setup.  Screw into coaxial cable and then another piece into a USB port which powers the antenna.  Did not have to put by window to get channels.  Kept it right near the TV which worked fine.  Tried it on 2 different tvs in different sides of the house and antenna picked up channels in both locations without issue.

setup???. The design is quite nice.  The claim that this HDTV antenna has a 130 miles reception is false advertisement.  I live about 60 miles away from the nearest broadcasting tv station.  There are 7 broadcasting stations in total in my area.  No matter how I placed the antenna trying to pickup a good signal source. Whether turning the amplifier on short or long range.  It makes no difference.  This HDTV 130 miles antenna only managed to pickup no more then 12 channels with weak signal coming in with scrambling pictures.  Even my old rabbit ear antenna could do about 10 channels without any special claims on it.If this HDTV 130 miles antenna is truly 130 miles as it claimed.  It should not have any probably picking up the signal from 60 miles away from where I live.  This is more like 50 miles HDTV antenna instead of 130 miles.  I wasted 30 dollars on this one.,3,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0

I was a bit skeptical of how this antenna would perform but I thought I'd give it a try and I was pleasantly surprised by the number of channels I am now able to receive and the clarity of the picture on my TV!  I don't know how well it will work in all geographical locations but it works fine here in southern Indiana.,5,1,2020-1-13,1,1,0
I was able to get one more network and several UHF channels with the Umusthave antenna. Total of 52 channels vs 40 with a former name brand amplified antenna. I would pay the price just to get the network I could not receive before. I am in the mountains about 50 miles from the city partially blocked by a mountain. Network speed is very slow so this is fantastic.,5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
Very good quality antenna. Had a different brand one before this one and that one cut out all the time. This one keeps a strong signal. Would recommend to anyone in a big city or miles out of town.,5,1,2020-4-23,1,1,0
I live in a suburb of a major city and am cutting down on cable costs.  This antenna works great for getting the local channels which is all I needed.,5,1,2020-9-10,1,1,0
I'm in San Antonio TX area. It's a good backup for when cable or satellite goes out. I use it in a spare bedroom.  It's does a very good job with local major broadcast channels. However I was somewhat disappointed in the number of channels it picked up. The scan showed 34 channels with 13 of them displaying no signal msg when selected. It did pick up several Spanish language channels if that appeals to you,4,1,2020-3-31,1,1,0
"Few days ago we got an antenna from Walmart and it was probably the worst, barely got any signal, the picture wasnt really clear and there was a lot of wiring included so we decided to get this Antenna as we saw it was cheaper too. Let me tell you this picture has such a clear picture, has no problem with signal, don't have to constantly be moving it around to get signal and doesn't come with all this crazy wiring, all you gotta do is connect it and done, probably the best antenna we have had.",5,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
"I purchased 2020 TV Antenna, Indoor Amplified HD Digital HDTV Antenna 200 Miles Range - Support 4K 1080p All Television with Indoor Powerful Amplifier Signal Booster for 4K Free Local Channels -17ft Coax Cable for my Mom. She was only getting 2 TV channels. The installation was so simple and right away we were able to get 60 channels. She is a sports fan and loves it she can now see all the basketball and football games. On Sunday she geared up for football snacks and TV NFL style. She was so happy and thankful she even was able to see Catholic Mass on Sunday!!! This actually works and I be getting one for my house.",5,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
"I can't believe that the TV can consistently be this clear from an antenna. Even though it said HD I didn't really believe it. It stormed for 4 hours here today which certain neighborhoods lost power and I experienced very little static/freezing. All in all, I'm really impressed with this antenna. I had the Comcast Double Play package. Once my contract ended, they tried to increase the price. Instead, I canceled my basic cable and went with solely internet. With this antenna, the cheap price will pay for itself and one month. After that, it's saving me $20/month for at least the next two years. Can't recommend enough",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
"This Amplified Antenna  is so easy to install and the picture is amazing .... so much clearer than the cable companies picture and you can't beat the price ... I am now cable free and so excited!  I get approximately 34 very clear, very crisp channels ... that is amazing considering I live in the mountainous region of Tennessee.  I sure picked a great product the first time purchasing an indoor antenna.",5,1,2019-11-15,1,1,0
"In the age of $250 cable tv bills or subscriptions to a growing list of content hoarding on-demand content providers (Netflix, Disney, AppleTV, Amazon, Hulu, etc)...there is still free local television. It's now broadcast in HD and all you need is a proper antenna.This model is replacing an older model that I've been using for a few years. The installation was easy and the quality of the picture immediately improved vs my older model.",5,1,2020-1-15,1,1,0
"It is very easy to set up. The range is super powerful. I had an old one which I had to move it to next to the windows every time I used it, as I didn't want to stick it to the wall.For this one, I just left it on the stand next to the TV. Signal is so good that no moving is necessary. I just turn on the TV, and it is good to go!",5,1,2020-9-9,1,1,0
I purchased this antenna due the dispute between Dish Network and a local NBC affiliate owned by Scripts. I did a little research and was looking for a reasonably priced digital antenna. Upon receipt of the antenna I immediately installed the antenna. Installation was trouble free and once the channel search was complete we have several channels that are not available on Dish including the local NBC station. We are well pleased!,5,1,2020-8-23,1,1,0
"I had an extra small flatscreen TV that was once in an RV. I didn’t want to pay monthly to connect it to cable, so I thought I would try this antenna. I am amazed that it picks up so many channels. The picture is just fine. I did not realize I could receive reception this good for free.",5,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0
We just purchased our HDTV Antenna on Amazon.  I wasn't looking forward to setting it up because I know these things can be a pain!  However I was pleasantly surprised when it came and I discovered how easy it was to set up.  We got an antenna in the hopes of getting rid of Hulu live.  We got an extra 29 channels!!!  Who knew we would get that many?!,5,1,2020-4-19,1,1,0

I loved this antenna.  The cord was thick and showed better quality over other antennas I have purchased i from other manufacturers.  I pick up channels that I have never received before.  I recommend going with this antenna.  Now I can cancel cable TV.  This antenna is going to save me a lot of money in the future.,5,1,2020-6-17,1,0,0
"First off let me say that I am not a technical person.  With that being said, let me thank you for making this antenna so easy for me to install and get working.  I am amazed that I was able to it my self and not have to call my son for help! Step by step instructions and easy to put together.Thank you so much - it works like a dream - crisp and clear with lots of channels coming thru!  I used this with a Samsung 55” UDTV.",5,1,2020-4-1,1,1,0
I set up the Antenna and had it running within a few minutes of connecting to TV and searching for channel. Set the antenna on my window and the quality was crystal clear and HD! I can finally watch sports real time without the hassle of streaming and buffering! Really recommend for everyone who doesn’t want to pay for cable while getting HD quality channels! Probably one of my best investments till date.,5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
"Clarity of stations sometimes would vary, the antenna cable needs to be set in location where it will not be disturbed otherwise with any antenna, clarity is an issue. Most local stations were no problem to get, beats paying additional $70. month for cable TV!!",4,1,2020-2-19,1,1,0
"A lifesaver to those who wants to cut the cable. If you're like me who watches the least amount of cable TV because you're either not interested or have no time, this thing is the answer. So easy to install and the reception is like you're still wired. The channels although limited has a true HD clarity. Save money from cable if you're only after the HD connection for regular channels. I highly recommend this indoor antenna.",5,1,2019-12-13,1,0,0

"AM VERY HAPPY WITH RECEPTION FROM THE Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna WE PURCHASED.  WE LIVE ABOUT 30 MILES SOUTH OF DALLAS AND APPROXIMATELY 25 -45 MILES FROM TV TOWERS AND WITH OLD ANTENNA ONLY GOT 29 CHANNELS AND DID NOT INCLUDE FOX, PBS OR NBC CHANNELS.

We live about 40 minutes from a couple of bigger cities.We cut the cable bill out of our lives so we’re looking to get a good quality antenna to help us get some options. Thank you!",4,1,2020-2-24,1,1,0
This antenna was super easy to install. I initially set it up in an upstairs room and had it by a window. It received 43 channels and based on charts I thought I would only get 39. I then moved it to the basement as I have a TV there where I work out. I was worried I wouldn't get any channels as my basement only has one tiny rectangular window which is no where close to the TV. I put the antenna above the TV and was able to get 33 channels and picture quality is great. This was much better then I expected!,5,1,2020-2-2,1,1,0
I ordered this antennae for an extra tv in my home. It picks up more channels than I thought it would. I would definitely order from this company again. I’m overall satisfied at the ease of setting it up. Thanks 😊,5,1,2020-5-2,1,1,0
"I have been pleasantly surprised on how well this product performs compared to another similar digital antenna I have.  My first digital antenna was purchased at a big box store, and I spent well over $50.  I was a little disappointed with the overall quality of the reception, which often presented with loss of signal and pixalated channel viewing.  This antenna has yet to give me any issue of losing the reception, and the picture is definitely HD quality.  For the value, I would recommend this product to any of my friends and family.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,1,0
It was an easy breezy installation. We got most of the local channels we want. Now we want to get another one for our bedroom TV. Highly recommended!,5,1,2020-8-16,1,1,0
"This HD Antenna is amazing!  I have held off on the purchase of an HD Antenna for many years as I was unsure what channels I would actually have access to and what the picture quality would be.  I should have made this purchase a long time ago, as this product provides me with crystal clear picture for all of the local channels (and more) that I was hoping for.  Great product, extremely easy set-up, great price and it even has a lifetime warranty!",5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0

I recently bought the HDTV antenna from Amazon and installed it.  I previously had an old over the air tv antenna that was 10 years old and worked fine in the city.  However we just moved 20 miles into the suburbs and the old antenna couldn't cut it!  I installed the new antenna and instantly got all the channels I used to have and some more.  Pictures comes in great clear and great quality.  I definitely recommend this antenna!,5,1,2020-9-10,1,1,0
"We were a little skeptical when we ordered, but thought that we would give it a try.  We live in a rural area with sketchy satellite coverage.  When we received our antenna, we were amazed at how easy it was to install.  We literally took it out of the box and plugged it into the tv without any special instructions.  Steps to do a channel search quickly popped up and took only a couple of minutes to download our channels.  We were able to get about 30 extra channels and the picture clarity seems clearer than our roku channels!  We are putting this antenna on other tv's in our home and dropping our satellite service.",5,1,2019-11-22,1,1,0
I immediately doubled my channels by hooking up the amplified antenna.  I'm getting some channels that the cable company doesn't offer in my area.  I hooked it up in the RV and it does better than the roof antenna.  It works as advertised!,5,1,2020-4-29,1,1,0

Took around 10 minutes counting the time it takes to find and scan for the channels. Crystal clear and a crap load of channels including CBS FOX NBC and ABC. Great small antenna that you don’t notice mounted on the wall. I will be getting a few more of them for a few different locations,5,1,2020-2-16,1,1,0
Just set up U Must Have digital HDTV antenna. I just switched toA streaming service and we could not get local PBS channels.,5,1,2020-2-20,1,1,0
I was initially disappointed that I only got a dozen or so channels.  I have a 40 year old antenna in my attic and get 25 channels on a tv in another room.  I played around with the placement of the antenna as well as using vs not using the amplifier.  I thought higher would be better but even at 12 feet it didn't help.  I was about to give up and send it back but I did one last scan -- the antenna happened to be propped against the wall below a window and I got 29 channels.  It's been sitting in the same spot for about a week and same sharp picture even with poor weather.Look up what channels you should expect in your area and then play around with placement you might be pleasantly surprised.,5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
Honestly this has been the best HD antenna I have ever bought. Not only is the picture super crisp but it also picked up more channels than any other.,5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
I have a cheaper TV antenna and I got the Basic channels!  I was hoping that this would be able to get more channels to choose from...NOT!!!  I’m hoping that I’m not going to get any Grief trying to return it and get my money back!!! I’m going to put the old one up again and enjoy the channels that I use to get!!!  I have to say that I did get more Channels but they were not in AMERICAN!!!,1,1,2020-2-15,1,1,0

"We ordered our Digital HDTV Antenna via Amazon and when it arrived we were able to set it up in a matter of minutes.  After connecting the amplifier and antenna to our HDTV we cycled through the channel selections within minutes and were watching clear and free TV!  We bought this antenna because with its amplifier we would be able to get not only the channels close to our home, but also one channel whose broadcast tower is about 40 miles away.  Our old system only went out to 25 miles.  We couldn't be happier!",5,1,2020-4-9,1,1,0

"I received an HDTV antenna as a gift. I have grown increasingly frustrated with my cable provider, a company I have used for 30 years. I was impressed with the range of programming available via the HDTV antenna. From my location, I receive over 30 channels. I appreciate being able to access local channels and also appreciate the clarity of both the picture and sound. This is an economical alternate to the rising cost of satellite and cable television offerings.",5,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0
"The antenna installation was a breeze. Had everything setup and running in 5 mins or so. We are getting about 50 channels now, when we were only getting 5 before.

This new GB HDTV Antenna gets full bar for 23 of the the 30 channels it's pulling in from my area. I was super easy to set up. Just needed to screw on rye coaxial cable and plug into one of the TV's USB post. Go to settings and scan for channels. Easy as that. I got 30 over the air channels. About 10 more than my old antenna. Money well spent.",5,1,2020-7-27,1,1,0

Plus, paying for channels that are repeated and are just junk isn’t worth it to me. The instructions and pics to install could not have been  easier. I spent 5 minutes installing and finding the best place to hang antenna. That’s it! I am very happy with this product : )",5,1,2020-8-26,1,1,0

"Did not work AT ALL. Pretty sure it was used, broken, or both. Tried every possible way to get it to pick up even one channel. Put it in window as a last resort in case it was the room blocking the signal strength. The plastic curled up and separated after a week.  This is a great scam for someone.  I see some reviewers got real ones: ours was clearly a fake.  Buyer beware.",1,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0

This is a great antenna.  I would recommend the product to others....",5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
Product was very easy to install it took about 5 minutes. Only reason it didn’t get 5 stars was due to the sticky pads that it came with to stick to the wall didn’t stick well to the wall. However some double sided duct tape should fix that easily. Picture and audio worked excellent unfortunately I don’t get very many channels where I’m at but the channels that I was able to obtain ran smoothly. Would recommend to buyers as the best bang for your buck.,4,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0

Honestly I was pretty skeptical, having had cable for so long, my vision of an antenna was big, bulky, and bad service but the installation and set up was so easy and the picture was perfectly clear!

I was shocked to see that not only does the antenna pull in the Connecticut stations, but also a couple from Rhode Island (not a strong as the other) and several from Massachusetts.  We are just south of Springfield MA.  It took a few minutes to find the right placement of the antenna.  Moving it just a foot or two can make a big difference.  For anyone looking for a good HDTV antenna they should consider this one.",5,1,2019-12-1,1,1,0

I will add this though - I was born in the age when tv was totally free. it went off a certain time every night. you got that snow on your tv or the national anthem playing. you used a wire clothes hanger to help you get a clear picture. you also bought a UHF antenna(as it was called when I was growing) to get those other stations. Which was only 4-5 more channels. Bottom line is that your antenna helps us to be able to afford to watch tv. Thank you",5,1,2020-5-11,1,1,0
"I recieved this antenna today. For an indoor antenna, I was very surprised at the amount of channels that I am receiving (11) so far, and i haven't yet tried all available areas to place it in order to receive even more channels.

I have tried several antennas in this price point (and even more expensive ones than this) and I have been disappointed with the signal so I kept trying different antennas until I found this one. I have been very impressed. It is simple to hookup and works great right out of the box. Simply do a channel search and you will be amazed at how many channels you can get. The extended range of the antenna helps get all the channels in your area. Most antennas have a 50-60 miles range. This one has 120 mile range . It makes a difference. Why pay more? Get this one.,5,1,2019-12-12,1,1,0

"I went with three stars because it's ok but seems to struggle with VHF.  I'm ~20 miles from Denver and it will not pick up ABC and only picks up NBC well if I put it outside( but still no ABC).  Inside NBC is sketchy at best in one location with ~ 1/2"" tolerance.  And then I lose PBS and couple other channels.  With a ""200 mile range"" I would expect better as ABC and NBC should be strong signals.  I have tried both with and with out the amplifier, several locations, and clipping copper cables and aluminum foil to it.  Still have some more playing to do but it really shouldn't be that sensitive and tricky.  Might be better to try a different one for a little more money.",3,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0

The only negative is that when it is very windy outside the picture comes and goes.,5,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
"I upgraded my old wire antenna with this one because of the signal booster. My local channels would always freeze and cut out no matter where i put it.

"Love it!  Took less then 5 minutes to install. What took the longest was unwrapping the wire ties that kept the cable/wires organized. We later used those same ties to tie up the extra length of wires. We tried two windows. One was definitely better but be careful with bundling the wires to tightly  It messed up the picture. Also an added note, after moving the antenna to another location, make sure you run the channel scan. That helps.  We are very happy. We can get local channels and FOX for the Super Bowl  Thank you",5,1,2020-1-26,1,0,0

I have been watching Spanish movies, English movies and even news! My kids have even had days that want to watch cartoons and I’ve found it within seconds with the antenna. I was paying way too much for cable and I’m glad I found this antenna online to help me budget!",5,1,2020-7-29,1,1,1
This antenna has been a life changer since I purchased the antenna. All those years I was wasting money on cable TV and paying monthly for rental equipments and tied into 2 year subscriptions. I regret wasting such money.I wish I had known about this Antenna all along. I would have saved money for about 10yrs + now. I watch 33 local channels provided in my area and they are crisp and clear.,5,1,2020-3-24,1,1,1

It is unbelievable.  Great value!,5,1,2020-4-28,1,1,0

I have had an excellent experience with the latest HDTV antenna that i had purchased.  I've been using these for a number of years now and the latest one I just purchased off of Amazon works even better than the rest.  I get all of the local channels clean and clear with no issues.  Previous antennas often get distortion when there is bad weather or someone walks in the path of the antenna but not the new one.  I have it on the second of three floors in our building and we still manage to get excellent signal.  Keep up the great work!,5,1,2020-2-6,1,1,0

The digital antenna was plug & play ... screw the coax cable in and plug the USB into an available slot in the TV (for power), mount the antenna on the wall with the 3 adhesive pads provided and then scan for channels.

I replaced my RCA HDTV antenna for this slim and light Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna and I love it.  The reason why I replaced my other antenna is that this new antenna can pick up signals at 200 miles. My other antenna can only pick up signals to about 75 miles and now my TV can pick up stations very easily without losing a signal. Thank you very much for this wonderful product and I will recommend this antenna to my friends and family.,5,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0

"I was skeptical at first. I bought 3 indoor antennas before. The products advertised better reception for HGTV, however, they never performed well. I was getting 18 channels with an extra amplifier and thought I could not get better than that. Boy I was wrong. I installed the antenna and run the channel search. I got 70 channels (Rockville, MD), 69 working without disruptions. The product exceeded expectations!Happy camper so far.",5,1,2020-2-2,1,1,0

I have a tv that is not located near windows and have plaster walls and brick house that make reception more difficult.  Wasn't sure what to expect from this one but it had a lot of great reviews, so i gave it a shot.  Glad I did, it is definitely worth it.  I get every local channel and all i did was stick it up on the wall behind the tv.  So it's still receiving all broadcasts on an interior wall.  It's great, i love it!",5,1,2020-1-30,1,0,0

"This antenna is my third trial to enhance reception quality by replacing antenna. After 2 previous antenna gave poor reception, I gave up the idea of getting a good signal for my TV. But, this antenna is at completely different level, it enabled me to watch whole major channels (Fox, CBS, ABC, NBC). Previous I could watch only a couple of them. I think that the reason is that this antenna comes with its own amplifier.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0
"Easy to install, but only  got 8 channels, 2 of which were Spanish.  The box did not indicate that the scan range for the antennae is 150 miles.  Did not get  CBS, ABC, or NBC, PBS..

We are receiving the local news stations plus some other channels that we never had before. We will definitely get one for out bedroom!",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
I was so excited to try your Amplified Digital Indoor HDTV Antenna. I live in an apartment and was a little skeptical about the results. To my surprise the Antenna worked perfect. Nice crystal clear local channels plus more extra. I very pleased with this product. It’s a must buy and the price couldn’t be better...definitely worth it.,5,1,2019-11-22,1,2,1
"This is the second one I bought from the same seller....and didn't work...a lot of scramble on the picture, the strength of de picture is very weak.  I finally made my own antenna,  and this time, I got nice and clear picture.",1,1,2020-4-19,1,1,0
This is the best indoor antenna I have ever bought. I have had many and most are not very good. I took the old one off and installed a new one in a matter of minutes. Anyone that needs an indoor antenna I suggest on this one.,5,1,2020-5-1,1,1,0
"Arrived in great condition, easy to install and program. I now get 20 local channels with zero monthly fees. Some of the channels air older programs and movies which are fun to watch plus Cozy TV, FBI channel, Court TV etc. We also get 4 , yes 4 of the PBS channels.",4,1,2020-3-25,1,1,0
"The installation of the antenna was extremely easy.  The instructions were easy to follow and the setup was very, very simple.  Once everything was connected and powered on, a quick channel search found more channels than I expected, about 50, which was a pleasant surprise.  I knew it would find the local broadcast stations, and was very pleased at the multiple other specialty channels, including a few broadcast movie channels.",5,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0
"Got this for a man cave in my garage. I cut cable and sat going on 10 years ago and have never looked back. I live in a dead zone, so for my house I had to put together a pretty heavy duty system to get the channels I wanted. But my garage is right next door and with this antenna I was able to get nearly all of the same channels as my external antenna with pre-amp and inline amp. I don't even have this antenna near a window, I stuck it up on a wall. Very happy with it.",5,1,2019-11-27,1,0,0
This thing was simplicity itself for me to install. Picked up an additional 42 channels right away. Love it. Great product.,5,1,2020-9-9,1,1,0
So much smarter than the monthly rent on one of the little digital boxes through cable.  Wanted for the news in the kitchen.  Lots of choices of channels and very clear picture.  Set up a breeze!,5,1,2020-7-9,1,1,0
"Product does everything that is expected from an antenna.  We set it up in the bedroom to be able to see our local news channel.  We received many more channels than we expected.  I love the flat design, and long thin cable.  The quality of the picture is excellent.  It was easy to setup, and worked immediately.I look forward to using another one in our family living space.",5,1,2019-12-2,1,1,0
I recently purchased the Amplified HD Digital TV Antenna on Amazon and installed it in my living room. I really liked how quickly and easily I was able to set it up. I was happy to see that I got several channels for free in my home. I was also impressed with the picture quality.,5,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0
"We were pleasantly surprised that when we tried this antenna on our TV that is normally hooked up to a pretty expensive big HD antenna in our attic, that it cleared up our reception. We are about 40 to 50 miles from the nearest TV stations and we tend to not get great reception for certain channels. This antenna works great!",5,1,2020-6-6,1,1,0
"Received my Amplified HD digital TV antenna last week and have been using it on my UHD Samsung TV. I previously had an old RCA antenna so the comparison is a little skewed. Overall, I do like my new antenna much better because the picture quality is much more bright, clear and detailed. I also appreciate that the order includes stickies to pin up my flat antenna. The antenna is also sturdy and well made. I thought it would be more paper like. I wish the antenna comes in different color options so I didn’t have to paint it to blend in with my white wall- or at least black and white options.",5,1,2019-12-19,1,0,0
"When opening the box, at first I thought cheap.  I was surprisingly  mistaken. Small and thin, does not mean cheap. This antenna blew away the quality of the one I replaced it with and it worked exceptional. I cannot believe the difference in reception signal quality and receiving channels that I did not expect in the Minneapolis Area.  Long cord is great for positioning and hiding. No more broken channels for me. I received 57 total channels in the south metro.",5,1,2020-4-24,1,1,0
"I just received this antenna today and when I opened it, it had hair stuck to the back of it where the self adhesive tape was located. It looked very used! It did not get very good reception for a 200 mile range as it claimed to have in the description. Also, it did not come with an 18 ft. coax cable as it claimed to have with it. I am sending this back!",1,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"I just received this antenna in the mail today from Amazon, hooked it up to my Sony HDTV, scanned for channels, found 35 channels. The channels came in very clean and clear and audio was incredible. Depending on what channel I switch to, it's either in the station or the antenna, but I sometimes get that weird multi-square distortion, like the content is being streamed online and it stops for a second. Other than that, I highly recommend this product!",5,1,2020-2-18,1,1,0
"I ordered the Gesobyte antenna through Amazon on 7/14/20. I was getting several channels with my old antenna, but knew there were more I could be receiving. I am receiving an additional 12 channels, and the channels I was already getting are coming in clearer. I am so glad for this purchase and would suggest for everyone that is cutting the cord. Or even as a backup if your cable or satellite goes down.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,1,0
"The flat panel HDTV Antenna your company has created and offered has been used in our home for the past 6 months plus and has been Outstanding! Before I offered my input I wanted to complete a fair amount of time use, and my family and I are amazed how convenient to use, how it picks up So many channels I did not expect to receive, and with such Clarity! This is truly a great value at such an extraordinary small price, Thanks!",5,1,2020-5-26,1,1,0
"I purchased two antennas.  My wife and I have an apartment in DC and a house out in northern MD.  I use an antenna in both locations and they work great.  I haven’t set them up in any permanent fashion, as I just put them high up on an exterior wall, however in both locations we are able to locate many channels (45+).  Works great!",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"It was simple to understand & the installation instructions were easy to understand. The parts were easy to hook up & to place. My pkg arrived just when they said it would. I had 43 extra viewing channels within just seconds. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for speedy service, simple instructions & a great product. ""The Free HDTV Antenna Card"" I found in my shipment was unexpected but the surprise was great. I redeemed the one per customer lifetime coupon for the antenna via email. So Super Easy!",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0
"I was doubtful when I purchased the antenna. However, after only ten minutes of installation time, to my surprise, the picture quality is excellent and I receive 56 channels. The antenna itself is small, flat and easily placed.  Now I can happily say goodbye to expensive cable. The HDTV Antenna is a worthwhile purchase.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0
"I bought this to get local the channels since I cancelled my cable, and it works as advertised. One tip when installing, try scanning for local channels with and without the booster. In my experience, I was not able to get all the channels I supposed to get when using the booster, without the booster I was able to all the local channels.",5,1,2020-3-23,1,1,0
"Very easy to install, 2 min later had few dozen channels available which is more than my previous hdtv antenna I used.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
I ordered the HDTV antenna off of amazon and it came two days later. This is the second antenna I purchased and far superior than the first model I tried. I get 12 more channels and a much stronger signal with the new antenna. The adhesive it comes with for the wall is very strong and the chord to run to the tv is quite long. Price point was quite reasonable and instillation was very intuitive. Overall I am very happy with the product.,5,1,2020-5-4,1,1,0
Wow!  It was connected quickly - it actually took me longer to clear everything away so I could get to the cable connection in back of the tv than it did to connect it!  Clearly receive 19 stations. I was wondering how it would be in a storm and about an hour later we got hit with high wind and torrential rain - it was fine.,5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
This was easy to install & immediately gave us a lot of local channels. We are on our way to getting rid of our high cable bill. Very pleased & recommend it to anyone interested in lowering your bills.,5,1,2019-12-17,1,1,0
I just bought LG 4k TV. I was looking for an antena.  I found this and ordered this TV antena. I got it  in one day.Set up is very easy. Just plug in cable and USB. Automatically TV found tons of program to watch free.,5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
I was very skeptical when I bought this! I'm trying to just stream and not use cable. However I do want to watch football games and local news coverage. This is perfect! Hooked it up to my smart TV and it immediately scanned 25 channels that I have for free and the picture quality is excellent! The antenna itself is tiny and very white so you can attach it to a window with no problem whatsoever,5,1,2020-4-1,1,1,0
"Flimsy, not easy to position for adequate signal reception. If you can get a signal, the picture quality is good. But the question is can you mount in order to position it for best signal reception. Limited to hanging on a wall which may not be best angle for reception.",2,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
I have this as a gift to a friend that couldn't afford cable service. She is thrilled to have the local stations for free now. We live in a rural area and it still picked up several stations.,5,1,2020-1-10,1,1,0
"We love this antenna.  It was easy to set up, and gets all of the major channels.  We will never go back to cable.May 15, 2020, update - I was promised a free antenna after emailing them and sharing my experience and rating on Amazon.  I have never received it.  Very disappointed.  Still love the antenna.",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0

"This product does NOT work, I was only able to see channels if I held the antenna up to the window! Even then it was spotty, cut out, and was grainy.",1,1,2020-5-26,1,1,0
I replaced my Cable TV with this.  Now I have no cable bill for my TV; the picture is perfect and also the sound.It was simple to install.  I like it and I'm saving a lot of money on monthly bills!,5,1,2020-6-11,1,1,0
"I am using the antenna because I recently found out that I could still access channels via antenna after I disconnected my cable services. I received the antenna and connected it. I was surprised to see that I could get channels clearly. I am enjoying the antenna and would recommend it to others, Thank you.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
"I bought this model because it claimed ""200+ miles range"". i thought that was likely overselling its capabilities, but would have settled for half of that. We are 35 miles from DC transmitters, and those come in well. We are 50-55 miles from Baltimore transmitters. and we get some of those - Fox and ABC - but not several others, and certainly nothing further than that. So, 3* for doing a good job for the very local, and nothing more, as the actual effective range is about 25% of what they claim.",3,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
"The antenna was easy to install. I used the double-sided pads included in the box to adhere the antenna to my window. I was super pleased that the cable is long enough to stretch to the window and still be easily tucked behind furniture and kept out of sight. I received even more channels than I expected, and I love that the antenna itself is not that conspicuous. I definitely recommend!",5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
I was kind of apprehensive at 1st in purchasing but I am glad I finally did because it was very easy to install and I was able to get 61 channels so tv watching will be pleasant again without the high cost of cable.,5,1,2020-2-9,1,1,1
"I was very impressed with the antenna I received, it is so light weight, and very sleek (I can barely notice it on my tv stand). It comes with adhesive if you want to mount it to a window but it worked fine for me without it. Honestly the whole setup took me less than 3 minutes. I wish I had known about this product sooner and now have a bunch of local channels from the air which are free I can enjoy - like the NBA playoffs!",5,1,2020-9-8,1,1,0
"I purchased this antenna in my look into ""cutting the cable""  I purchased this one based on the price point and the ratings which made it the clear choice.  The installation process was quite simple.  My older TV's usb couldn't power the antenna, but the included plug adapter activated the device.  Going into the TV's settings, and setting it to TV\Antenna then doing a channel scan provided very high quality pictures on all the major channels, which is what I was looking for, and this was without fiddling with the placement of the antenna.  I live in a suburban area, and that wasn't an issue either.  The pictures are every bit as good as what cable provides on these major stations.  I'm very pleased with this antenna.",5,1,2019-11-12,1,0,0
I'm emailing to share my experience with  you regarding my new HDTV Antenna. Prior to purchasing it I was using another antenna and I was not able to get channels to come in clear. I scanned it several times with no luck. But after installing my new HDTV antenna my channels work wonderfully. Your antenna is great and I will definitely recommend it to others. I look forward to hearing from you soon and receiving my free antenna to put on my other TV'S in my home.Thank you!,5,1,2020-3-17,1,1,0
"I  bought this to replace another antenna that we mostly use during and after a hurricane, but also to catch some old shows that they don't show on cable TV anymore! The antenna it replaced would constantly break up on certain channels. It just wasn't strong enough. When I found this antenna and saw all of the great reviews and affordable price, I decided to give it a try. I love the switch from long range to short range, it does make a difference. I was able to pick up the channels that my old antenna just couldn't do smoothly! Definitely recommend!",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0

I installed this new flat antenna in minutes . I now have more channels than I have ever had!! I have a metal roof on my home so I set the antenna in my window and that was it.

The purchase of a HDTV antenna has completed the utility of a recently purchased HD TV. Getting our local channels as well as the PBS stations is more than worth the purchase price many times over.

"I think I hit the jack pot with this one it’s true to its description the picture quality is is perfect,it’s  super easy to install , the sheerness will have you thinking you’re at a movie theater lol but overall this is was a great investment for me I would definitely order again I get most of all my local channels crystal clear",5,1,2020-9-4,1,1,0
"I was very skeptical about this product but was blown out of the water. I was expecting 5-10 channels but was able to get 62!! The antenna itself is lightweight and easy to place.

"Do not waste your time. This is no better than a cheap set of rabbit ears. We were using an antenna we paid a dollar for at the Dollar Store.  Getting this we were hoping for something a lot better with 150 Miles Range.  No, this works the same and no better. Then the cheep one we have. Back it goes.",1,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
Great product.  Installed it in a bedroom that only had a fire stick.  Gets all local channels as well as dozens of others.  Very easy instructions to follow.  Will most likely get another for a family member.,5,1,2019-11-28,1,1,0
This is a very directional antenna.  You have to have it facing the direction of the towers for it to work.  Unfortunately the closest window I can put it in faces east and I only get a few stations at 50-60% signal at best.  A south window is not an option and it does not work well indoors.,1,1,2020-1-17,1,1,0
"I’ve had HDTV antennas before and was skeptical about this one but I took a chance and it was definitely worth it! Not only is their product is as described but where it helped me big time was their tips on placement. After making one change according to their tips, I had all my channels working perfectly. Much appreciated guys.",5,1,2020-7-30,1,1,0

I said the one I bought years ago was thin.  It is.  However, this one makes that first one look quite thick and seem a bit thick..  This antenna from Abash Tech is ultra thin and ultra lightweight, so much so I doubted it would work.  It works so well I ordered another one for a friend.",5,1,2020-5-4,1,1,0

"What a great bargain. Less than $30 and so easy to setup. I started with a beer and the instructions. The instructions were well written, easy to understand and had several useful tips. When I hooked the antenna up, it went very smooth. I ended up with 12 channels; pretty good for my area. Only one of the channels stuttered. If I ever decide to cut the cord, this antenna will make it easier. PS: A day without laughter is a wasted day.",5,1,2020-4-18,1,1,0

We live in the Metro-Detroit area and get at least 50 channels (including sub-channels from each network) and with great quality. What's strange is that channel 2 will work some days and not others, but I doubt that is an issue with the antenna because on the days it works, it really works. We recommended this antenna to a friend who also bought one recently and is also having a great experience. Definitely worth the low one-time price!",5,1,2019-12-4,1,1,0

I purchased this after one of my neighbors recommended getting a simple antenna. This came in today and took about 45 seconds to install. The picture quality is much better than I ever thought it would be. The clarity is fanatic.

All that  needed ,was to stick the antenna to the wall behind the tv, which was 10-12 ft away from the nearest window and the let the tv scan for the channels . It took approximately 2 minutes . Highly recommend this antenna.",5,1,2020-2-20,1,1,1

"We received your HDTV Antenna yesterday, February 19, 2020.  We set it up to work on our TV.  WOW!  Great reception.  We didn't think we would get anything as we live 80 miles from the closest station.  Now we can watch the boys state hockey championship and high school state basketball tournaments.Thanks!!

I’ve bought many antennas over the years and some very expensive. I can honestly say this is the best one I’ve owned so far! I highly recommend it! We got twice as many channels and better reception compared to the others we have gotten.,5,1,2020-2-12,1,1,0
Took a few minutes to set which most of that time was unpacking the box. Excellent quality that provides more channels than I though I had. Thank you,5,1,2020-5-28,1,1,0
"We did away with cable after we purchased roku. We didn't get our local stations and purchased this antenna. Very easy to hook up, great picture with no problems, at such a great price. I highly recommend it. We get all our local stations, plus so much more",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
"This is an amazing product. It literally took me less than 2 mins to hook up with my TV and within the first scan of fewer than 6 mins, it captured 25 Channels just like a piece of cake. True HDTV quality saving me a good amount of money from the Cable bill. I am going to recommend this to my friends.Also, I am going to move this around different locations in my house as it has an 18ft cable to get more channels.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
Live in Yuma AZ.  Parents came to visit during the winter with their RV.  We were only able to find four spanish-language channels using the antenna on the roof of their RV.  Ordered this antenna because it was inexpensive and figured worth a shot.  Just plugged it in and was immediately able to locate 27 primarily English-language channels.Very satisfied with the antenna.,5,1,2020-2-2,1,1,0
I had the antenna setup easily in no time.  It is worth trying to position your antenna in a few different spots / directions and rescan.  I was able to get more stations when pointed in one direction than another.The antenna has great range.  Probably 60-65 miles.,5,1,2020-9-14,1,0,0
I'm extremely satisfied with the HD Digital TV Antenna! Shipping was lightning fast and the packaging was top notch. It was very easy to install and setup. The included instructions were excellent. In just a few minutes I was watching crystal clear (and free) local broadcast TV.,5,1,2020-2-4,1,2,0
"Took only about 10 minutes to set up to get crystal clear over the air stations.  You may need to move antenna around to various spots to see where you get the most channels. Once you have found the best spot in your room, you’ll love this product!!",5,1,2020-5-16,1,2,0
"This is my first time ever using an antenna and I am absolutely thrilled. I recently ""cut the cord"" and with digital streaming and the addition of my new HDTV antenna I have everything I need WITHOUT the expensive monthly fees!I was very surprised at the amount of channels I receive and the quality of the reception. I am now a big fan and intend to spread the word to families members and friends that we no longer have to be captive to cable or satellite companies.",5,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0
"I got my HDTV antenna last week.  Connecting it was a snap!  I appreciate the suggestions to try it with and without the amplifier.  I tried it both ways and got great connections using it.  I am not a cord cutter yet, but I got the antenna so I could watch two games at one time on a single big screen TV.  Now when the NFL comes back, I can watch one game while having Red Zone going on the other screen.  Thanks for the great product!",5,1,2020-5-4,1,1,0
"I love these antennas I bought from Amazon! It works wonderfully! I love all the channels I can see. I needed to hear the news to stay updated because I can't afford cable so this antenna was such a blessing to find. I especially love that now my grand children can watch tv in their spare room. Pretty efficient, I recommend.",5,1,2020-9-9,1,1,0
"We are so happy to be able to cut the cord and get Free TV channels with our new Antenna! The picture quality really is great with this one! Our scan showed 13 channels, but when we started scrolling through the channels and our TVs guide, we really have over 100 channels with this Antenna! We highly recommend it!",5,1,2020-2-9,1,1,0
"After having purchased several antennas, I was hoping this would be the best and last. Sadly, I actually lost some channels. I've scanned and rescanned several times, tried moving it to different areas hoping it would catch a signal to find those missing channels, but nothing. This is worse than the cheap antenna I got at Walmart. It loses signal on the channels it did manage to find. Worst purchase.",1,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0
Just got in my antenna and I must say I am very pleased. As soon as I plug it in and set it up the channels just started coming right end. Clear as day. No adjusting the antenna like I’ve had to in the past. No channels going in and out or freezing. I have already sent the link to family members. Best antenna EVER!,5,1,2020-4-26,1,1,0
Works as advertised! Great price! I now have 3x as many channels!,5,1,2020-1-2,1,2,0
"Unlike the last amplified flat antennae I had, I don't have to move the cable around to bring in all all the stations clearly. This one pulls in all of the stations no matter the positioning of the cable which allows keeping all the cabling neat. The whole package is very professional and having two different strength settings is a plus although I can receive all of my stations on one setting",5,1,2020-7-16,1,1,0

I am very happy to discover another option for my senior father to watch TV.  We have been paying DirectTV for the past 5 years and wasted hard earned money just to watch the same channels that are free with this antenna.The quality of the channels are amazing.  And installing and setting up the anntenna was super easy.  I was able to get 51 HD quality channel.  My family is more than happy with this product.,5,1,2020-2-28,1,1,0
"I ordered my antenna after cancelling Xfinity due to their HORRIBLE SERVICE AND PRICES...I was unsure of how much good an antenna would do, but I ordered this anyway. To my delight, it arrived in one day. The set-up was quick, easy and it found 63 channels within 10 minutes. In addition, this antenna allows me to rewind up to 90 minutes, simply by using a USB drive. Excellent product and service! I'll definitely order one for the other rooms in my home! Thank you!",5,1,2020-2-2,1,1,0
"This will not work if mounted on an inside wall. I get zero channels. In order for me to put it on a window, the cord must go across my living room! And then I’m only getting about 40 channels, sometimes as few as 20. When the picture comes in, it’s a good quality. Most of the time it is very choppy. I can’t watch NBC without losing signal. I live 55 miles from Chicago! Will be returning",2,1,2020-6-14,1,1,0
"This is the second UMustHave antenna that we purchased. We have found it gets the most channels and doesn’t have to be moved around a lot. We have trouble getting ABC with other antennas, but not with this one. We even get 6 channels from a neighboring state that is about 35 miles away.",4,1,2020-2-4,1,1,0
This antenna is easy to install.  The smart TV we have is the challenge.  It took some time to figure out how to get the TV to scan for the channels the second time.  We finally did get them.,5,1,2019-12-11,1,1,0
Great Antenna! I set it up in about 2 minutes and had great quality tv once I programmed the channels shortly after! It got more channels than I thought I was going to get and the picture quality is perfect HD. Definitely recommend to save on a cable bill!,5,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
"I just purchased your antenna to use on my TV when I lose my satellite signal (I live in FL and the storms will interfere with getting a signal).  My current antenna only received 13 channels,  and for the price wanted to try this one.  I now get 37 channels and the picture quality is great.  My only negative is not being able to get a channel I wanted,  but for the money,  this antenna is a good value.",4,1,2020-8-2,1,1,0
We've had our hdtv antenna for about a month & we are so happy - we're able to pick up one of the network stations (abc) while our other antennas haven't been able to get the signal. Definitely recommend!,5,1,2020-8-24,1,1,0
"I wasn't sure what to expect, but we're very happy with this purchase.  We cut cable and were considering different online streaming services that included local channels.  Since we live in a metro area with towers relatively close, we decided to try an antenna first.  Everything I needed was included in the box.  I ran an auto scan in my TV settings and I was amazed to see one of our local channels pop up with a crystal clear picture.",5,1,2020-7-3,1,1,0
Set up 10 mins and it pulled few good amount of channels. For my mom's room.  Might buy again for my son's room later.,5,1,2020-7-22,1,1,0
"This antenna was incredibly easy to set-up. It already proven its worth in the short time I’ve had it; keeping signal throughout variable weather. A few channels did not come through well at first, however, a quick re-scanning of channels via my TV helped resolve the issue. Great product for the price. 4 Stars on Picture Quality, but I attribute this to having an older television and not the abilities of the antenna.",5,1,2020-4-2,1,1,0

"We just ordered the antenna from your company and set it up. We were pleased to see we had immediate and clear access to SO many channels. The antenna is working very well so far and we are happy to know all of the major networks we watch like NBC, CBS and Fox are still readily available to us without cable. We’ve been cable customers for so many years, but they kept raising their prices so we decided to piece meal together a package that would work best for us with the antenna, Netflix, Disney+ and Hulu. We’ve now cut our home entertainment bill by more than 50%!!!!Thanks for making it easy to transition out!",5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"I was initially skeptical at how many channels this antenna would give me and what the picture quality would be like, but this is far and above a better antenna than I could have imagined.

I would recommend this to anyone",5,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0
"The amplified hdtv antenna with up to 120 mi range worked as stated. We hooked it up to our flatscreen, plugged in amplifier and scanned the stations and we picked up 20 stations with clear picture. Now we are returning the cable company's box and canceling our $50 month cable. The amplified antenna worked better than expected and our family couldn't be happier and no longer need our local Spectrum cable provider. Thanks again. Great product.",5,1,2020-1-29,1,1,0
"This antenna is excellent and I highly recommend it. I am more than satisfied with this antenna- this is the best antenna I have ever had. Previous antennas I have owned in the past have only given me at the most 20-something channels.. this antenna has given me 44! I am so very happy to have this antenna and the quality is so good, it is perfect, there are no signal issues- I cannot wait to watch the New Year's Eve special this year, which was the intended reason for my purchase. It even comes with a deal for a second one for free! I had no idea I could get a second one for free by leaving feedback- my parents visited and saw the antenna, they wanted to buy one for themselves and I told them I would get one for them.. so thank you for this opportunity and a great product!",5,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
We just hooked this antenna up to a Samsung 32 inch TV and turned it on. Then we did a channel search and was shocked at how many channels we got. We got 12 good quality clear picture channels. For free. !!!,5,1,2020-6-24,1,1,0

"Easy set up! Good quality. It was worth the price I paid for my amplified HD digital TV antenna.The picture quality is great! Better than I anticipated. I will buy extensions for the cables because my tv hangs on a wall that is in the center of the house and not next to a window. If I stand and hold it near the window, it works great!  So I hung it on a wall closer to a window for now. Works great!",5,1,2020-7-17,1,1,0
"Ok so, this antenna works great and its easy to set up. HOWEVER, when you email them about the warranty they will then ask you to write a review to receive another free antenna. The problem with this is, its a way to sway your review, and its NOT even the same antenna. The free antenna is a different brand, very cheaply made and does NOT get the same channels. 1 star for the dishonesty.",1,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
"Due to my mother living in a small town that did away with all of their cable service, she was stuck with no TV at all.

I then ordered your U Must Have digital HDTV Antenna from Amazon and she now gets 18 channels and  all of her favorite ones also.

One of the few things that many streaming services haven't been able to provide over the years is live national/local news and sports broadcasted on the major news networks. Our new antenna was able to provide these and much more! We picked up over 40 channels in our area, which include much more than the news! I would highly recommend picking one of these up for anyone that doesn't have one.",5,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
Recently tried out a few well reviewed name brands of antennas. Sadly left very disappointed in not getting but 1-3 just ok channels. I moved the antenna location to several places in the house using the recommendations with no luck. I saw your antenna and said this was the last chance or id give up on antennas. To my surprise your antenna is great.  Fantastic range and quality and stability in channels.  Main reason I'm so happy is I purchased this for my dad and won't feel like I let him down.

I bought this product in hopes of having better reception in a hilly area.  The antenna I bought from a big box store did not pick up all the channels.  This one didnt either although it advertised a much longer range.  I even mounted on an outside wall in my enclosed porch in attempt to improve picture quality to no avail.  I would return but damaged the cable when I mounted above the rafter in the porch.  Lesson learned.  I will have to install an outdoor antenna.,1,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0

"I purchased this model because of the large amount of good reviews.  I live 45 miles (in a straight line) from NY City and about 60 miles (in a straight line) from Philadelphia, so I would think that I would have been able to receive a lot of channels.  The antenna was purchased for a TV on a screened in porch so I couldn't get any closer to a window.  After placing, scanning, replacing and rescanning about 30 times, both with the power adaptor and without, the most channels I got was 11...and all of them would play with a lot of pixelations.

I bought this antenna for my 55 inch Panasonic Viera TV. I had to replace a 8 year old HD TV that wasn't really HD and kept getting signal interruptions -- plus the design was quite ugly and visible due to it being white. This TV easily plugs into the USB slot so its easy to install; very quick setup. No signal interruptions and no need to set up it near the window for best signal. Since it's USB powered you no longer need to constantly worry about signal interruptions. Absolutely the best. Since the color is black it easily blends in with your TV and background.,5,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0

Thanks to you and your product I am able to bring that money back into my pocket and pay California state taxes. 🙂The reason I didn't vote a full 5 star overall is because I didn't get the little stickies in my package as promised.

They were responsive and I look forward to receiving these stickies so I can place my antenna exactly where I want it.",4,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0

Great product.  I finally cut cable tv and purchased an antenna that only accessed 9 channels with poor reception.  I purchased this one and fell in love.  It receives over 30 channels and the reception is crystal clear.  I highly recommend this antenna.,5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
"The antenna arrived very quickly, only one day. The installation was so easy that just took me 10 minutes to do it. I used to have another cheaper antenna that I got to avoid paying cable, but it was difficult to get some local channels like CBS and NBC. This new antenna has better signal and I can see more channels including the locals. It has been more than a week and the image is still strong and clear. I can watch more channels than I could before. I am really satisfied with this antenna, it is a good deal.",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
"Installed in my living room which is in the center of my house, so was installed on an interior wall.  Was able to get all my local channels and they were all crystal clear.

I got rid of my expensive cable and bought this antenna instead.  It was very affordable. I was worried about installation because I really don't know about electronics. But I was so excited to find it was very easy to install. It took me about 30 seconds to plug in and I was ready to go!  I get great reception and a lot of extra channels.  I love it - and I'm saving $250 every month!  Thank you for making such a great product!  I would definitely recommend this antenna!,5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0

"The Amplified HD Digital Antenna allowed me to cut the cable and reduce my monthly cable bill in half.  I no longer subscribe to cable services, rather I watch HD over-the-air broadcast and on-demand videos from Amazon prime.  The new antenna took a few small minutes to install.  The profile of the antenna is easy to hide and sits behind my TV out of sight.  The TV reception is as clear as my cable services.  Super happy with the results and the quality of the product.",4,1,2020-2-25,1,1,0

This is honestly an antenna deserving of 5 stars it’s amazing picture quality it’s really easy to install and it has tons of channels.... I decided to switch from cable a few months ago and got an antenna that was not up to the standards of this one and since it got this and installed it has been amazing I have all the channels I need and then some.. “most importantly my mom gets to watch jeopardy and wheel of fortune.,5,1,2020-5-21,1,1,0

"Didnt work as advertised. An old metal antenna picked up 10 more channels than this with both in same location. Tried turning, relocating, with amplifying and without; same poor results. Decided to return as it was a ""fulfilled by Amazon"" purchase.",1,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
"Thanks so much for speedy delivery, and for a product that works as advertised! I installed this antenna in my kitchen for the small TV we have there, nowhere near a window, and We are able to get 8 channels quite clearly. Sadly, the only channel that I haven't had luck with yet is PBS, but I think if I move the antenna and re-scan I might be able to receive it as well. I really only care about the Big 3 networks and PBS because I will be getting the rest of what we like through our apple TV and Sling subscription. It's great to still be able to get local news!  Thanks again!",5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
"I recently purchased the HDTV antenna, and love it!! We got rid of cable tv Over a year ago and just stream Netflix and Hulu for our tv shows. The one thing I missed was being able to watch the local news, so I purchased this antenna as a way to get the news stations. I couldn’t believe how lightweight the antenna was and how easy it was to setup! We were done and scanning for our channels within 5 minutes. I am so pleased and will be telling my friends without cable they should invest in one as well!",5,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0
My antenna arrived this morning. Hooked it up just laying behind the tv and was immediately able to get 4 more channels than I had with my previous antenna. Would highly recommend,5,1,2020-1-24,1,1,0
We bought the antenna so my husband could watch the super bowl.  We were so amazed at the reception and the picture quality.  Our tv provider had taken down some of the channels we subscribed.  We ended up with about 30 or more channels.  We will use this antenna on our tv so we can watch the channels we lost.,5,1,2020-2-3,1,1,0
"From the moment I plugged in it which was super easy, I was amazed at the quality and performance.  It has been nothing short of amazing to locate so many channels and have such an amazing reception.  I would love another to brag to all of my friends and share the amazing impact watching these channels including the daily news have helped us.  Great job on bringing a quality product to the market.",5,1,2020-8-4,1,1,1
Picture quality is the best ever.  I never thought it would be this good.  Took me longer to get it out of the box and packaging than it did to install.  I have not just the major network channels but a total of 41+.  Highly recommend.,5,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0

"EDIT... I changed this from 4 stars to 5 because I rescanned it and now I’m getting all the channels it shows I should be getting. I recently cut the cord with cable and looked at all the reviews for antennas. This one had the longest range and the most channels available. I was extremely satisfied with how easy it was to set up and the clarity of the channels. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there are a few channels that show I have but it’s a black screen. I think that may be me needing to try my channel search again. I just haven’t gotten the tv back from my husband to do that. All in all, it’s a great product.",5,1,2020-5-19,1,0,0
"Once I found the right spot to park this antenna, it worked quite well; the picture is high-quality and the signal consistent. My location, by the way, is about 25 miles from the originating broadcast.",5,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
I have  ”cut the cord” so to speak and this antennae allowed me to access so many more channels......finally a local channel!  . ...so many more channels than what my  smart Samsung  TV provided.

Might buy another soon.",5,1,2020-6-27,1,1,0

The picture of the device in the instructions was a little different than the actual device but it was not a problem. I liked the tips that were included on how to get the best reception.

I am very satisfied with the performance of this antenna! Especially after trying the old fashion “rabbit ear” type which was very discouraging.

If I lived on higher ground I bet they would come in perfect but I'm pleased with how clear the channels I already got come in.",5,1,2020-3-30,1,1,0
I recently purchased this antenna in hopes of getting away from the only cable option I have!  I had their service for 6. Months and have spent countless hours on the phone complaining of poor service and multiple trips to their store for replacement parts!  NO MORE!  I’m free........This antenna was so easy to plug in and GO!  Over 50 channels popped up in a matter of minutes.  I definitely recommend this option and its very affordable!,5,1,2020-4-9,1,1,0
"I was skeptical when I purchased this HDTV antenna thinking that the picture quality would be poor and the variety of available programming would be limited to two or three local channels. Upon connecting the antenna I was pleasantly surprised to find that I received a total of 36 channels including all of the local network channels in my area. In addition, I have found the picture quality to be excellent - comparable to, or better than, that provided by our Comcast cable service. Based on my experience with this antenna, I am now seriously considering cutting the cable.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,0,0

We live in Florida many, many miles away from a tv tower or a large city and this antenna pulled in 22 channels for us even though we are in a bad reception area.  We put the antenna  in a window on an outside wall facing north and was thrilled with how many channels we got, when we had very limited success with previous outdoor antennas we had tried. Installation took just a few minutes and instructions were very clear. I am not always happy with everything I buy but this product exceeded my expectations.

Actually a very solid antenna! Easy install and good picture for a great price. The only possible thing I could say that might be a negative is that the power cord and the antenna cord are at the end of the longer length of cord.

I used this for my bedroom tv. I get 195 channels which includes local and others. To my pleasant surprise I get cable channels I watch all the time. I am 80 years old and was able to easily install it. A great product that saves money as I don’t need a cable box anymore.,5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
I am impressed with the HDTV antenna I recently purchased. It was simple to set up and install.  Not only do I pick up a lot of channels over the air but many of them are high quality pictures. I also enjoy a lot of the old classics I pick up that where not available on cable TV. I highly recommend this great product!Don S.,5,1,2020-3-19,1,1,0

"Very easy to set up - just placed the antenna and fed the coax cable over to the tv. I live close enough to the towers to not need the amplifier, and I get over 40 digital channels that look great for the most part (channels that broadcast reruns of old shows and movies don't have as good of picture quality, but that's expected). Definitely worth the money!",5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0

Just received and hooked it up today.  It took about two minutes.  I hooked it up with the amplifier they supplied and only received 14 channels.  I then read the directions and hooked it up without the amplifier and I now have 42 channels.  Picture quality is outstanding.  I am recommending to friends and family.,5,1,2020-2-9,1,1,0

Very simple to install. I programmed my channels using the short and long range options. Long range gave me the most channels but you can’t beat the service for the price. Good-bye expensive Att-Uverse with limited channels. I’m definitely going to recommend this antenna to friends and co-workers.,5,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0
"The antenna works great. I live in the country, over 30 miles from the nearest tv station tower but I still pulled 18 channels with this antenna. I am amazed at how ultra thin the antenna is, its hard to believe it's an antenna at all compared to the bulky things I have used in the past. It comes with adhesive pads to stick to the wall and the cable is plenty long. I am very pleased with the purchase.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
"I received my digital HD TV antenna, unboxed it, and installed it in less than three minutes. I’m in a rural area,  and I am able to receive all my local channels. It works very well! I’ve tried other antennas and they do not receive all the local channels and the reception seems to frequently interact. With this unit it seems to have a strong enough receiver.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,1,0
"This didn't give me any more channels or better reception than my first generation Leaf tv antenna. In fact, it gave me less. Tried it in every conceivable spot I could reach. Nothing. Not worth the price for me, I never used it, and it's sitting in it's box until I get tired of looking at it and eventually throw it out. Don't waste your money.",1,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
Loved the ease of “cutting the cable cord”!  This product was quickly shipped and had it installed and working within 5 minutes of unboxing!The picture quality is incredible and we actually picked up a few more channels than we bargained for!,5,1,2020-5-3,1,1,0

"Just bought and set up my first one a few days ago. It definitely helps. I used to get 0 channels, now I get 7. Only about 4 of them come in clearly, but luckily the ones I need (Fox and ABC) come in great. So overall, I am happy with this antenna. Glad I bought it. Thanks",5,1,2020-2-11,1,1,0
I had to buy a new antenna after my cat chewed the cord on my old one. She did me a favor because now I can receive channels that I couldn’t get before. The antenna arrived when promised and was easy to install. The picture is clear and I’m very pleased. Highly recommended.,5,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0

"I was very concerned that the product would not work. So I hooked up the easy instructions and hit scan for the channels. This was placed on a T.V in the basement, so while it was scanning I went back upstairs. A little while later I heard noises from the basement and lo behold I had channels on a T,V with no cable. I was amazed. I will not be skeptical again.",5,1,2020-9-15,1,1,0
"This is seriously such a game changer for those who refuse to pay  monthly for cable packages! One purchase of this antenna and I can watch a ton of channels without any monthly cost. I get ABC, Laff, FOX, NBC, PBS and all the major news networks! Since I live near a big city, I probably get about 100 channels with this.

"Our family watches very little live television and decided to cut the cable. We mostly stream from Prime and Netflix, as well as a couple of news analysts.  We only wanted the local channels for local news and sports so we opted to try a couple different antennas.  After trying another smaller antenna that did not work well (only 6 channels came through), I placed this antenna on my living room wall.  After the first tuning session, I received over 20 channels clearly from one direction.  When I relocated it to the adjacent wall for the second session, I was able to receive over 40 channels including some from the Dallas area!  This antenna works really well and is easy to install.  It's a steal!",5,1,2019-11-18,1,0,0

I was very pleased with the easy of set up and picture. I have tried other antennas but had to return them. This one was easy to connect and on my first try was able to get 26 channels!  I was even more excited once I viewed them all and they came in better than my streaming channels. Thanks for a great product.,5,1,2020-8-17,1,1,0
Received my antenna via Amazon very quickly. The setup instructions are simple and thorough. I'm in a fairly large city and receive about 45 channels. Very happy with that!

We eliminated almost $200 a month from our bills eliminating cable.We are really happy with this product.",5,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0

Near major cities, I don't use the booster and still pick up more channels that the previous antenna I owned. I'm glad I bought the antenna. I will recommend the antenna to my coworkers.",5,1,2020-4-7,1,1,0
"I am extremely happy with my TV antenna purchase. Being a long-time subscriber to expensive cable services, I wanted to give this a try. I couldn’t be happier since I received it and now am considering cancelling my cable subscription. The channel selection is plentiful for my area, making it hard to justify the increasing costs of paying for cable.",5,1,2020-4-29,1,1,0

"This antenna is great! I have a condo in the Mobile, AL area, that I bought this for. It picks up at least 15 stations as clear as a bell, including the NBC and CBS stations. It also picks up the ABC station in Pensacola, FL, although not quite a clearly. The two Mobile stations, though, come in so well, one would would think they were on cable.",5,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
If I could give less than one star I would. Antenna has constant buffering. During a 30min show it will buffer and lose signal at least every 90-120 seconds. I have moved it all over as far as the coax cable will allow. NOTHING works. Just a piece of JUNK!!! Will throw it away and replace with good old fashion rabbit ears. Reception would have to be better!UPDATE--I needed to up date the review to say that although the antenna did not work for me the company made it RIGHT! They were very FAIR in settling the matter. If you contact the company with any problems they are helpful in answering any questions and offering solutions,2,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
I am old enough to remember over-the-air TV and I re-lived the thrill of finding new stations with your product.

"Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I had no idea that i would be able to discontinue my cable and be able to get all of my local channels + some for free.  I can't wait to discontinue my cable service on April 1 and install your antenna in each of our rooms with a TV.  The picture is clear, and is as good if not better, than cable.",5,1,2020-3-23,1,1,0
"Thank you for producing such an amazing product!  The change it has made in our family is fantastic.  We live 35 miles, as the crow flies, from the nearest TV transmitting tower.

Now back to our favorite TV program.",5,1,2020-4-22,1,1,0
I was replacing a cheap antenna from Walmart. After installation and scanning for channels I had fewer channels and lost NBC altogether. After spending 45 min moving the antenna around the room and rescanning with no improvements I had to dig the old one out of the trash and use it. Save your money. Don’t buy this one.,1,1,2020-4-23,1,1,0

Wrong amp. Mine was sent with a generic amplifier that had NO high/low amp. setting. Works well but I paid more than many others because of the high/low switch feature which (in the end) is NOT what I received. 😕,3,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0

I have bought four other antennas in the past and this one is by far the best. 19 channels found all in high definition. The picture is solid does not go in and out.

"After only about 5 minutes of installation on two television sets and a channel search on each set, I now have 50 channels or more on each set!  Goodbye expensive Cable TV!  There are HD channels as well as other Digital channels.  Also there are channels not available on cable TV.  Before I only watched the major networks on Cable anyway so I no longer see the reason to have it anymore.  I estimate saving about $150 monthly.  Thanks for such a great product and fast shipment!",5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
We got this antenna thinking we'd get 5-7 local channels. With the antenna connected in the house and on the wall (not the ideal location) the TV found 74 channels and almost all of them have very good reception and picture quality. Really surprised.,5,1,2020-6-30,1,1,0

It seems better during the day, when it's a clear and nice day.But partilularly on the 1st floor, all channels tend to have issues. Sometimes channel 7 and 4 have better quality. But the reception should be improved on these antenna.",3,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0

I was getting about 15 channels. It took a couple of minutes to set the new HDTV Antenna. After I auto programmed, I was amazed to see that I had over 100 channels. The picture quality is also better. My only regret is that I did not upgrade sooner.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,1,0

"I received my new GB antenna two days after ordering. I didn't expect much since I was already using a similar but older antenna in the south Charlotte area and only could pick up one of the major networks, so I had to subscribe to a streaming live TV service. After simply propping up my new antenna, I was amazed to find 56 channels discovered, including all the major networks! Now I can watch NFL and college football without having to pay the recently jacked-up prices of streaming TV services and save over $700 a year! What a deal!",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0
What an amazing antenna! Recently my community had a rescan on the tv stations and I was receiving about 20 channels with basic bunny ears and then after the rescan my channels were about 5 downstairs and 7 upstairs. This simple tool that actually looks nice too and fits securely behind the TV ( without the ungly antenna ears) has our home receiving about 25 channels on a good day!,5,1,2019-11-11,1,1,0
Shipping was fast and my antenna arrived in a nice box carefully wrapped in a zip lock bag.  The instructions were easy to follow and set up a breeze. I now am able to watch at least 20 channels. Depends on where I have the antenna set up as we live pretty far out. Internet isn't even an option here. I'm happy with my purchase and would definitely buy again if needed.,5,1,2020-6-8,1,1,0
I have to admit that I was skeptical that this antenna would pick up any channels at all given where I live. I am a considerable distance away from the closest television station plus there are many trees around my home. But after installing the antenna and running a couple of scans I found that I received several channels. I only had to do more than one scan because I had to reposition it due to the distance from the station as I mentioned and the trees around my home. I would highly recommend this antenna.,4,1,2020-1-22,1,0,1

This antenna works well and is very easy to setup. I ordered two. One had mounting holes for pins in it and the other did not. The way to mount the latter is to put a light on the antenna and push a pin through an area without the internal antenna components in the way.

I have been trying to find an antenna that will pick up broadcasts in VHF High frequencies, and this one won't do it.  Picks up signals from other towers in the same area, but not the two on these frequencies.",3,1,2020-5-11,1,0,0

More like 50 or 60.,4,1,2020-1-28,1,1,0

Okay so I “cut the cord” but wanted to watch local football. Went to best buy and bought a 75 mile antenna. When I got home my wife made fun of me because of all the $50 ones with 200 mile range. So I bought this one planning to return the one from Best Buy. . The 75 mile range got me 17 channels. This 200 mile one got me 3 and 2 didn’t work well.,2,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0

Unfortunately this antenna did not pull in all of the major networks as I had hoped.  I'm 70 miles away from a major metropolitan area with no mountains (not even hills) in the way so not sure what the problem is.

So I bought this antennae to receive Providence and Boston channels from my house and then loaded Netflix on my Smart TV and everything works great.

I’m spoiled getting hd quality thru Netflix and prime but with the super bowl coming soon I need FOX which is not free and I refuse to pay for a normal channel.

Definitely worth the buy.  I still don't get how cable companies can get away with charging for free over the air channels...,5,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0

I picked up an impressive 142 channels!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the cable from the antenna to the connector is kind of flimsy and the connection broke at the coax connector (that happened while I was testing to determine whether it worked better with or without the amplifier).  I did splice another male coax jack onto it but ultimately that's why I need to purchase a replacement.,4,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0

"I upgraded(???) from the 2019 model because the amplifier just randomly died the other day.  This ""new"" model looks exactly like the old one and doesn't seem to pull in the channels as well as the 2019 model.

It's no longer a slight turn, but a complete repositioning at a different level of height and several feet away from where I get all other channels.",3,1,2020-3-18,1,0,0

I installed this product in my basement where I've had trouble with TV reception with other antennas.  This one provided crystal clear reception for all of the channels I needed and expected in my region.  With my old antenna I could only get and 75% of the major network stations.

There are instructions on how to have an idea if this antenna will give you what channels or if any, do so and check before purchasing the product.  The instructions are straightforward.

I got over 50 channels on the first scan and the antenna wasn’t even mounted to the wall yet. I will say I live in a high floor that has a lot of air traffic and it still works amazingly.

I live in Northern Arizona where stations are a distance away. I will not need cable or satellite anymore. Thank you,5,1,2020-8-1,1,1,0

I live in the country where you cannot get cable TV and satellite  is very expensive these days.  So I bought this antenna hoping to get at least the local channels for news and something to watch while cooking dinner in the kitchen.  It works great and the picture is great.  Will probably get another one for our houseboat too !,5,1,2020-5-18,1,1,0
Works great I only get 20 channels tho,5,1,2020-6-4,1,1,0
My basement TV has never been able to receive any HDTV stations.  I tried other antennas including the traditional rabbit ears.  None worked.  I plugged this HDTV antenna in and then scanned for HDTV channels.  It found over 40 HDTV channels on my basement TV.  Works great.,5,1,2020-2-5,1,1,0

Antenna was reasonably priced and works well in a rural setting 35+ miles away from Station towers. Amazing how many channels we get besides all of the locals. Helped us to get away from Directv. Great value and saving $100 a monthwithout Directv.,5,1,2020-5-23,1,1,0
"The instructions to set-up the HD antenna were very clear and took only a few minutes to install.

You won't be disappointed!",5,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0
Range isn't great. 15 miles from all access towers and had issues until I installed an additional amplifier. If you use an indoor antenna expect to use more than the provided amplfier included. After that works great.,3,1,2019-12-21,1,0,0

I recently moved to New York City. I am on a budget and was not willing to pay 80 to 100 $ for cable. I enjoy watching the news as well as shows like the Bachelor live. I received my antenna and immediately installed it. The installation as so simple! When I first placed it on the wall I was missing a few channels. I emailed the support contact provided and was contacted immediately! Once I adjusted the antenna I received all channels I needed. IDK why people pay for cable!,5,1,2020-9-15,1,0,0

"Great product! Had my doubts because I’ve never used an antenna before and figured it wouldn’t work, I was wrong! Installed in an RV parked in a metal building and worked great! 26 channels that came in perfectly clear! Canceling cable and installing on house tvs!! Highly recommend and great price!",5,1,2020-3-29,1,1,0
I didn't expect this to work very well but wow I was wrong! Ordered so that I could watch the Superbowl and didn't expect that I'd get many channels if any at all. I get over 30 channels in HD and I live 15 miles away from a smallish city. Awesome!,5,1,2020-2-21,1,1,0

Very easy to install!  I also live in a very remote area and used the long range button.  We brought in 16 digital Chanels.  Previous antennas would only bring in about half.  We installed in an AirBnB after the existing antenna gave out.  I needed a solution that was quick and easy.  Very nice product!,5,1,2020-7-10,1,1,0

"I put this antenna on three different TVs, in 3 different locations in the house, and in 2 different houses 30 miles apart.  The second house I used it at, a friend's, was because it was 20 miles from several television stations and their broadcast towers.In all scenarios, after the full scan, this antenna did not pick up a single TV station.  NONE!  Really.  Not a single station including 4 stations 20 miles away.",1,1,2020-6-13,1,0,0
"I live within two miles of several broadcast towers, so I figured a digital antenna would work.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I wanted to be able to watch the news live. This was such a cost effective way to meet that need. Thank you!",5,1,2020-4-8,1,1,0
Does its job. Picture. Better than cable on channels you find in your range.  Good price too- Update I went ahead and tested and found my old RCA ANTENNA WAS trying 5 more stations.  I returned this one.,3,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
Love this antenna.  Had one that was twice as expensive but would get bad reception whenever anyone walked arpund the house.  This antenna gives us 70 channels whereas the last one gave us only 10.  The picture quality is also way better.  No interference when we walk around either.  I also love that the cord is long and black so it blends nicely.,5,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
"I have a Sony 4k TV. I had to watch a youtube video to provide me some guidance on properly setting it up. (I'm not that much a tech-wiz). Once I was able to set it up, it was a breeze.

I recently purchased a digital tv antenna from Amazon. I purchased theU MUST HAVE digital antenna with amplifier. Initial set was very simple and upon scanning channels came up with 22 channels available in my area in NY. The picture quality via the signal for my local channels was extremely good.

Wish I’d gotten this sooner.",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
This HD antenna wass our ticket to cutting cable. It was a very easy installation and setup. We get all our local channels plus a whole lot more channels. It's fun to see all the old shows that we grew up on. We're very Happ with our purchase. A big savings on our budget with free TV!,5,1,2020-4-30,1,1,0
It’s not bulky. Used the sticky tabs that came with it & needed to move it in a different place on the window. The sticky tabs were extremely hard to remove that I had to roll it off with my nails so tabs are unusable again. We’re always adjusting the antenna. When you use the guide feature on you remote & it’s always stating no information available. I’m going back to my old antenna.,3,1,2020-4-20,1,0,0
Easy installation and great reception once I made the correct adjustments where to hang it on the wall. Receive way more channels than I expected. Just needs a little longer cord when you need to hang it from a ceiling location that is not close to the tv.,5,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0
I purchased the antenna because I didn’t want a cable bill. I’ve had the HDTV antenna for about a week and I like everything about it.

The setup took about five minutes and the channels are crystal clear.,5,1,2020-4-19,1,1,0

Seeing is believing! I followed the instructions step by step. And then Tah Dah!!!  Better then I anticipated!!  More channels then I had expected.

I purchased the antenna to serve as a backup when my direct tv goes out.  It seems that almost every time there is moderate rain or hefty wind the cable goes out.  This antenna works even in harsh weather and has a very crisp picture.  Because it gets channels that are not on direct tv I watch it much more often than I thought I would.

I have found that some of the over the air channels look better than my directv. I would definitely recommend this product.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
"I just purchased this amplified Digital Indoor HDTV Antenna.  My old antenna is similar to this one except that it is not amplified.

We installed this new antenna, and our tv is interior so the antenna is on a wall in the middle of the house, at least 15 feet away from the nearest window, but we get nbc and abc no problem.  Plus our search feature picked up 56 other channels.  We might just cancel sling and go internet only, why use a streaming service with 56 channels!?!",5,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0

"I love the image quality. The antenna gets several channels, but in my case at least, one location does not get all channels at the same time. What I mean by that is that if I want to change channels I have to re-locate the antenna. One location gets me a some channels, and another location some different ones. The coverage is not uniform. This makes the viewing experience a little less effective. However, once I lock in to a channel, the picture is perfect.",3,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0

We live in the country so I was hesitant to try this antenna as our service isnt the best but with this we were able to get many channels and I am very satisfied with this product.

"This antenna is awesome! I haven't had cable in a few years now,  and missed it, but didn't want to pay for overpriced cable. I'm in Houston, and I get 168 channels with it sitting behind my TV. I could probably get more if I put it to the window, but I'm good with the channels I get.",5,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0
I have the antenna as high as possible in a window and yet Fox rarely comes in.  NBC is 50/50.  ABC and CBS are the best of the four locals but even those glitch from time to time.  The advertising says 180 miles range yet I'm not picking up signals for stations/towers that are less than 20 miles away.  Fairly disappointed.,2,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0

I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an antenna for their home!  Great value!",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
I purchased your antenna last week in hopes to cut away from cable tv. I had hoped for 10-12 channels but I’m getting more then 30 and my local channels are as clear as when I had cable. Love your product and I’m recommending them to all of my real estate clients.,5,1,2020-8-4,1,1,0

"This is a great antenna!  Picks up 17 channels for us and we live out in the country.  Installation is super easy.  The only thing we have had a problem with is the stickiness wearing out.  It falls off of our wall, but we have paneling, so that might be one reason.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,1,0

"This is the second one we purchased. This one was in our great room downstairs, on a big screen that we really watch.  It worked for a little while then it just stopped receiving channels.  We moved it upstairs 3 week ago and it worked for one day.  We would do a search two or more times in one setting.  It would show 15 - 25 channels as being found but when we turn to a channel a message ""NO SIGNAL FOUND"" is all we saw. we did purchase the warranty.",2,1,2020-4-22,1,0,0
We really like the HDTV Antenna.  Very easy to  install.  Most local channels come great.  Sometimes you have to move antenna around to get a few other channels to some in.  It's great to have free local channels.,5,1,2020-4-11,1,1,0

It’s saving money on cable and we get the local news station that we wanted. Would recommend to anyone!",5,1,2020-3-25,1,1,0
"VERY easy to install and a great way for us to watch the Sunday football games without paying $30+ per month. Everything you need comes with it, including the power adapter if your TV doesn’t have a USB port (and assuming you have an auto converter in your TV, which most do). Easy to set up. Just don’t forget to go into the ant/cable settings of your TV to scan for channels once it’s placed.",5,1,2020-9-20,1,0,0

After hooking up my new antenna I thought I made a mistake when the channels began to scan. I tried other antennas in the past and they did not scan so when the scanning took place I thought something was going wrong. I wound up picking up 74 channels!
