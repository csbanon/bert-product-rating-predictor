UPDATE: 2/28/2019 - This is now a FIVE star review. Please read the initial review and the update below.Initial review:,1,1,2019-2-18,1,2,0
"First off, to all the intel fanboys, yes we know the 8700k is the world grand champion for ultra high fps 1080p gaming when paired with an overpowered gpu.... but... this is by no means a slouch!  It's cheaper to build an awesome gaming/streaming rig with this and in the end your streaming results will be better.  I have been using this cpu now for a few weeks and frankly I can't see why anyone would go with intel right now... 8700k costs more and doesn't come with a cooler...this costs less and comes with a good cooler...  sure you can have 10 - 20 more fps when paired with a 1080ti but whats 120 vs 140 fps?  In some games this cpu even will beat out the 8700k btw so it's not really that far behind in gaming, but holy crap is this a multitasking beast... I can be rendering a video, playing games and streaming all at once with virtually no performance hit to the game...  and interestingly enough newer games seem to be using the 16 threads this offers... universe sandbox 2 will use all 16 threads and in intense simulation will nearly max it out... I asked myself then, what if I only had 6 cores like the 8700k?  ... I can tell you what, the game would have suffered.Cinebench scores reflect the true  power this cpu offers... this one out of the box hit 1809cb points... a click or two in the bios and managed 1851 while still using stock clocks.... just enabling precision boost overdrive.",5,1,2018-5-21,1,4,0
"General:I just upgraded from my old AMD FX 6300 build and the difference truly is night and day! Aesthetically, the prism cooler that came included is really gorgeous, though figuring out how to control the colors may prove to be somewhat difficult (I'm still reading up on it, and trying to snyc the colors with my ASUS motherboard).",5,1,2018-5-13,1,1,0
"This is a Beast!This processor is very good! I do Image Editing and mainly use Capture One and Photoshop. Previously I used i7 5th Gen CPU and with this upgrade, I can see a huge performance boost! Paired with X470Motherboard and GTX 1080, this beast is unstoppable. I quickly Exported ""25"" 46Mp RAW files to JPG in Capture One and this guy took only 40 Seconds!!! Whereas the same thing would take 3-4 minutes in my old setup. What more can I ask for? Here is my system details (Happy, happy)",5,1,2018-6-19,1,1,1
"This is a post will discredit Amazon a bit. I bought this CPU and it worked great for almost a month until it shorted itself out. I have had many issues buying PC parts from Amazon and I don't understand why. GPUs shipped broken, monitors busted... Anyway, this is supposed to be a review about the CPU itself.I actually got my currently-working 2700X from eBay on a sale. It's fantastic! 8 cores, 16 threads of 4.4GHz without even manually overclocking; the CPU overclocks itself better than I could!",5,1,2018-10-21,1,1,0
"**To control the RGB lighting on the cooler you only need to connect the USB connection to a motherboard USB Header and download the Wraith Prism Software from their site.. You DO NOT need to use the RGB cable. I know, sounds silly but this took me many face palms to figure out**I just recently built a system. 2700X paired with a MSi X570-A Pro motherboard, 16GB of Patriot Viper Steel RAM and a EVGA GTX 1080 SC2. I am amazed at the ""Out of the box"" performance of all these parts. No overclocking and I'm getting over 100fps @ 1080p on a 144Hz monitor in Borderlands 3 with all settings maxed out except volumetric lightning which i set to medium. The CPU idles around 37c-41c using the stock Wraith Prism cooler. I can not recommend this CPU enough. Ryzen is the definitely leading the way for gamers. A+",5,1,2019-11-15,1,7,1
"Coming from a Haswell-E 5820K, there is a significant boost in performance with the 2700X. This is my first AMD chip since the Athlon XP series. AMD has made a comeback in a big way and I'm happy to say they are finally able to seriously compete with Intel.I highly underestimated just how much the 5820K was bottlenecking my SLI GTX 970's. My average frame rate, depending on the game, has jumped 10 - 30fps. A good example would be Deus Ex Mankind Divided. A horribly optimized game that ran sub 40fps on the same SLI setup with the 5820K. That same game now never dips below 50fps, with an average of 65 - 70fps. Impressive.",5,1,2018-10-7,1,1,0
"This CPU is an amazing chip. I've worked with a lot of cpus and this one destroys absolutely everything. It has great ram support and it legitimately destroys the i7 6700k out of the box. If you are looking for a good motherboard, I really liked the ASRock X470 Master SLI/AC. I've built a lot of systems and I loved this motherboard. Unfortunately, this motherboard is a newegg exclusive but its really a good board. I used my old 3200 mhz g G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 16GB memory. It runs at 3200 mhz by changing a single bios setting. This system is very stable and runs great. At first, I was sceptical about leaving Intel CPUs but I'm glad I did now. If your on the fence about this purchase, you should just go ahead and buy it. It's really the best value and performance in it's class. Plus it has an AWESOME stock cooler.",5,1,2018-6-20,1,1,0
This was my first time building a PC. I always heard that putting in the processor would be the most terrifying part.It really wasn't bad at all. LOL. The little needles lined up nicely and it was super easy to get them in thanks to very clear guides on the processor.,5,1,2019-11-15,1,6,1
"This is just frustrating. Have only been using this processor for 7 MONTHS and it suddenly shuts down! Before purchasing this processor I read so many reviews and watch so many videos just to make sure I was purchasing the best for what I was going to use it. I built in my desktop on February 2019 , so excited to be using it for work ( Graphic Designer and Video Editing production) everything was going good until last week when the PC suddenly shuts down... Sent it for an evaluation and the test showed that the AMD Processor was DEAD...Contacted Amazon Support and the only response I had was to email a department that would send me a response ( still waiting after 3 days ). SO are we paying all this money for something that is supposed to last only half a year? THIS IS CRAZY.  Was having high hopes here AMD.",1,1,2019-8-30,1,7,0
"I paired this Processor with an MSI X470 Gaming Plus MB, 16GB of DDR4 3000 Team Force Memory, a Nemix 512MB SSD & a Sapphire RX580 8GB Video Card. Power is supplied by a ThermalTake 750 Watt Power Supply. This was an upgrade from my 10 year old Intel Core 2 Duo 3.0ghz processor & 8GB of DDR2 Memory. The system is running Windows 10 Pro. The installation & instructions were straight forward. On the initial setup, I briefly had the the CPU running at 4.4Ghz. The system was stable, with no problems. The only concern I had was running at this speed (using the Stock Ryzen 2700X CPU Cooler set to High) the CPU temps were too high for my liking. So I reset my CPU speed back to stock (3.7Ghz) & the CPU temps are back where they should be. Take Note: If your going to Overclock this CPU, I recommend using a better quality cooler or you would risk damage to your CPU. As far as speed/quickness compared to my old system, hands down this new build is lighting fast. I hope I have many years of good service with the CPU/Motherboard Combo. Take Note: My 1st attempt using the same components (CPU & Motherboard), I had to RMA back to Amazon. Symptoms: Failed POST. No power - Nothing. Contacted Amazon & they made the RMA Process very smooth. They replaced both the CPU & the MSI Motherboard with no questions asked & no cost to me. Once I had the new components in hand, I proceeded a 2nd time. As previously mentioned, I encountered no issues. I was able to pick up the AMD 2700X at $265 & the MSI Gaming Plus MB at $90. Quite a bargain compared to Intel's Offerings. Bottom Line: Equal/Superior Overall Performance without spending twice the cost. Watch Out Intel, AMD will be eating your lunch. Anyone considering this processor should give this processor a Serious Consideration before spending more money on Intel's Offerings.",5,1,2019-1-5,1,1,0
"My son was excited about getting this processor. The shipping and receiving process was quick. Needles to say as soon as it arrived he got right to work on installing it. We both struggled like all hell to get the damn clips to latch on and push down on the lever. After several times of taking turns getting it on and thinking this feels to tight to fit on. But I got it on and we both thought finally, it's smooth sailing from here. Or so we thought. My son and I are standing on the side of the case watching the pretty rgb lights of the CPU fan. When all of a sudden we hear the retention clip snap back and see the piece of the bracket that holds the CPU fan in place flying across the side of the computer case. The look of disappointment on my son's face instantly puts me  on high level THIS IS BS mode. I mean I was pissed. Now he can't game on his computer because theirs no way to keep the cooler on the processor. AMD needs to make this right by sending us replacement brackets for making the retention clips unnecessarily tight.",3,1,2019-12-11,1,3,0
I love it I switch from an Intel 6700k I didn’t wipe my os  however but it seemed to work fine after a few updates the hiccups are mostly gone. Luckily I turned my license digital so I reactivated windows. I purchased this with the asus strix 470 f mobo. Seems to be a power house. Whatever I may have lost in gaming compared to intel I’ve gained plenty on multitasking. It’s like nothing phases this cpu.,5,1,2018-5-17,1,1,0
"I don't know what's more appalling, my socks and sandals or the poor packaging for my processor. I normally don't complain about this sort of thing so long as nothing is broken, but look at that sad piece of paper doing it's damndest to keep my merchandise safe. This lonely little guy must have fought the whole way from Somewheresville California just to keep my expensive crap safe from the shipping monsters kicking and smashing the box. Good job buddy! I just wish you had some bubble wrap friends for support. I did get a great prime day deal on this but at what cost? :,( Let us have a moment of silence for the Fs not given by this disgruntled amazon employee ...................Thank you.",4,1,2019-7-26,1,2,1
"while trying to decide on what all I was going to use in my first build. I settled on a complete AMD system and as of today, I haven't been/couldn't be any happier with my decisions. AMD give so much more for your dollar compared to Intel and comparing their performance and stats side by side you get so much for so much less. I'm fairly computer literate but i have a guy for things i can't do and even HE was amazed at the performance and capabilities of this system having the Ryzen 7 2700X processor at its heart!",5,1,2019-12-15,1,2,0
"As I purchase this  on sale, it is an incredible value in computer technology. For my new build, I decided to give AMD the nod, and went with this processor. (I have not built with AMD since the Athlon X2 6000 Windsor core.). This CPU handily outperforms my OCd i7-5930K on the X99 platform, and that is no slouch, for a lot less money. I am running this on an ASUS Crosshair VI Extreme X370 Motherboard, and I am not noticing any thing missing from X470. My overclock and RAM compatibility are fine.While this is truly a great CPU, (and I look forward to Matisse), this is not a great overclocker CPU. You can get some extra frequency out of it with superior water cooling and some luck with the silicon lottery, but do not expect much over 4.3 Ghz. Of course, I did not buy this  CPU for the overclocking potential. I am running 4.1 Ghz on all cores with air cooling, and am quite satisfied. Your own results may vary. This CPU will be used for both Content creation and for gaming. Very glad I went with this CPU.",5,1,2019-4-10,1,1,0
"I managed to snag this bad boy up on Black Friday, and got it for around $100 less than the normal price. Even at its standard price, this is still an excellent CPU for gaming, media creation, and workstations. Even with the stock cooler, there is a little bit of room for overclocking, though the performance is more than adequate at stock clock speeds. The fact that the included cooler is RGB is awesome. The fan looks amazing in the case.About the ONLY negative I can think of is that the cooler is a bit loud at idle. That said, when the fan speed ramps up, it doesn't get much louder. It's not annoyingly loud or anything... but, in a quiet room, you'll notice it.",5,1,2019-1-14,1,1,0
"Needed to upgrade,  gave my i7 4770k pc to my kids and used this for a living room htpc. Great for games movies and basic computing's. At 150 dollars I am very very happy. AMD is about to release 3rd gen so prices might drop slightly in 5 months but at thos price why wait.Updated 2 months later, great with games however trash with video converting,  PC crashes everytime, just a blank screen while pc runs. I turned the power Management fir the cpu to 60% instead of 100 and no more crashes. This is with an upgraded fan with a corsair case so the air flow is on point and after market fan but this will not work at full strength. I am very disappointed there and now should've bout the 3rd gen ryzen. Everything else is flawless running 100% power but if you video convert stay away. The i7 4770k which is 5 years old does video converting so not sure what the deal here is.",3,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0
"So I bought this processor purely because Ryzen has a pattern of much better multi-core performance over Intel (even though per-core strength is typically weaker than the Intel equivalent from this generation), and if you're the type that will be doing any kind of creative work with Adobe, you want a processor like this.At over $100 cheaper than the i7-8700K, it is about 10% less powerful in gaming and simple desktop performance, but you can actually get 5% or better workstation performance than an Intel CPU. Not much of a gain, but price-to-performance in that category is really hard to pass up when you're talking about saving $100 and getting a CPU cooler included with the processor.",5,1,2019-9-6,1,3,0
"This processor is a beast, but had trouble overcooking past 4.2 GHz on OC.  Other then this it is a great processor and handled everything without any trouble.",5,1,2018-5-6,1,1,0
"I have been an Intel fan for over 20 years and never considered anything else until it was time for a new build. I was shocked to see the increase prices for Intel CPUs with no real increase in performance. I read the reviews for AMD and was convinced to give this CPU a try.When the CPU arrived I was very pleased to see it already had its own COU fan included, win AMD!  Standard CPU install. I paired this with a crosshair Hero VII Mobo so I can fiddle around with overclocking and I installed 6 SDDs",5,1,2019-3-15,1,2,0
"Up and running a few weeks now, boot is near instantaneous once BIOS posts (note, using ADATA SX8200 M.2 NVM SSD).  Paired with an ASUS ROG Crosshair Hero VII w/WiFi, and 16GB (2x8GB) Corsair Vengeance 3GHz DDR4.The good:",5,1,2018-11-7,1,4,0
"AMD score BIG with this processor! GREAT price for this kind of performance and It comes with a GREAT air cooler, I came from an intel 4790k + R290x + 32gb of DDR3 1600mhz, and the 2700x is 2 to 3 times faster (cinebench on 4790k is 866 poins and on 2700x it's near 1700 with stock settings). I had it for less than a month, i'm still configuring the new machine (x470 Asus Strix ITX + EVGA 1080ti SC2 + 32Gb Corsair 3333mhs - maximum RAM speed i can run stable right now is 3000mhz - this combination is more than 3x faster than the old one). This processor is the new performance/price king of this generation! Really recommend it!Edit on 07/16/2018",5,1,2018-6-24,1,6,0
I've spent a lot of money in the past for performance versus price. Until this CPU came along I was always on the other side of the fence. My first AMD was a Sempron and wasn't that impressive until I upgraded it to the Athlon 64X2-4600. It was the fastest thing I'd ever bought until I purchased this Ryzen 7 2700X. Turned out to be the best number crunching CPU I owned for the money. I was very impressed by it's performance and truly didn't expect any big change. The promises posted by AMD were spot on considering typical sales pitches by other prominent companies. For the first time I actually noticed a significant performance increase instead of the ones that make you have buyers remorse afterwards. Ryzen will be my Go To chip from now on.,5,1,2020-1-7,1,3,0
"Doing multi threaded tasks like rendering it is almost 4 times faster than my i5 6500. It is faster with gaming, and the games run very smooth without any hiccups. I am using a Mugen 5 for the cooler on a msi b450 tomahawk max MB and 16 gigs of Corsair Vengence 3200 ram. Everything worked right out of the box with little tinkering.I did some overclocking bringing it up to 4.1+ on all cores and it ran fine. The Tomahawk has a single click Game Boost function which works very well.  At stock speed it runs everything fast and cool.",5,1,2020-1-18,1,3,0
"I'm going on my fourth AMD Ryzen build with three of them using the Ryzen 7 2700X.  All of the 2700Xs are overclocked at 4.3GHZ with liquid cooling.  Extremely pleased with performance, stability, price, availability and support.  I know AMD plans to support AM4 platform until at least 2020.  I look forward to upgrading with lastest Ryzen at 7nm or smaller maybe in 2020.  So these builds are good at least to 2022 or later I would guess without having to upgrade motherboards.  If you account for all the parameters for choosing a CPU platform, AMD Ryzen totally blows away Intel platforms which are stuck at 14nm.The only downside is I wish the CPU didn't include the Wraith Prism LED Cooler as it is such a waste since I'm always building these as liquid cooled.  I got all these air coolers with no use for them.  No one to give them to as not many Alaskans build their own computers.",5,1,2019-1-7,1,4,0
"My i7 4790k board died and I really wanted to support AMD in their return to the competition!  I'm very happy with this cpu.  I'm running this on the Asus Crosshair 7 Hero with 32gigs of G-Skill Trident Z F4-3200C16D-32GTZRX.There was a small learning curve to overclock it but I got it running at 4.25ghz on all cores at 1.3875v and running 32gb RAM at 3400mhz.  Cooling is a Corsair H150i RGB.  I am 100% stable with Aida64, Prime95 with small FFT's on, Cinabench and 3dMark.  Temps barely touch 80c in Prime95 small FFT's.  I used the OC preset number 3 (forgot the name of the setting but there are many guides online",5,1,2019-1-3,1,1,0
I've enjoyed this CPU for about half a year.It's been a great value and has done fantastic for both games and content creation.,5,1,2019-9-28,1,0,0
"I do a lot on my computer. I game (Destiny at max res 144fps), digital graphics, stream, download, upload, and play movies. I do many of these at the same time pretty often. I have never had an issue with this processor. It takes everything I can throw at it and never shows signs of a problem. Tech geeks will stress test this thing, and feed you a bunch of tech information that will only matter to other tech geeks. As a regular joe who uses his PC for everything, and has had this processor for year now, I can say its worth every cent.",5,1,2019-6-29,1,2,0
"This is an amazing chip for what it does at this price-point. I'm not talking budget-level performance either. This is enthusiast-grade performance without the nasty Intel price-points. And the chip is designed to provide almost all of the performance it's capable of out of the box, without having to do anything with it (great for basic consumers who don't want to fuss with settings and whatnot).Overclocker enthusiasts beware though; this chip is designed to run itself to the limits. So on the one hand, it's awesome that you're basically getting almost all the performance it's capable of out of the box (CPU/case cooling being the limiting factor; your mileage may vary). But for those of you who love to tinker with your components to try to get the most performance out of them; overclocking Ryzen 2000 and 3000 series is basically pointless. There's very minuscule performance to be gained, and in quite a few cases you actually lose performance even with higher clocks. You're better off overclocking your RAM as that is more effective at boosting the compute performance... for this I highly recommend you check out your motherboard vendor's Quality Verification Listing for compatible RAM. Go check out Gamers Nexus' Youtube channel for more on this.",5,1,2019-8-3,1,3,0
"Using this with Asus ROG 470 mobo, and all works fine with Wiin7.  Excellent value for desktop or decent gaming rig.In order to install Win7 you will have to locate some of the drivers yourself, but they are available.  Microsoft will try to make you believe Win7 won't work on these newer Ryzens, but absolutely not true - I'm writing this on the Win7 Ryzen machine.  In fact a lot of benchmarks come in better running Win7 rather than Win10.",5,1,2018-9-28,1,5,0
"Well I got this for myself along with a Crosshair VII Hero Wifi board but I made the mistake of buying the board and CPU when I was working 60 hour weeks. Right after the return window expired I was able to properly test the board, which was defective. It took Asus 2 months and 2 RMA trips to get the board straightened out. Shame on you Asus. The only lesson I learned is I won't buy a motherboard unless I have enough time to test it.My brother upgraded to a huge 32"" 4k display but he was still rocking a Core i7-2600k and a GTX 970. For Christmas I gave him the working Ryzen setup along with 16gb of G.Skill Flare X 3200mhz cl 14 memory, and a GTX 1080 handmedown because I found a 1080ti before the stock dried up. I had never seen him so happy, which made the upgrade worth for him worth it. It makes sense since the 2700x performs the same as the i9-9900k and i7-8700k at 4k when gaming, mainly because the GPU is the bottleneck.",5,1,2018-12-28,1,3,0
"Hello, I bought this Processor, with it I bought mother board, Power Supply, Memory, M.2 SSD, deepcool fans, please check the links:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CF31C1Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",1,1,2019-8-11,1,3,0
"I chose this card because I wanted a powerful workstation that could handle a lot of multitasking. This has good speeds, but more appealing to me was the fact that it has 8 cores. So while I think this is a fine CPU for gaming, it should also be able to handle a lot of different tasks that require a powerful CPU.It seems fast and my benchmark tests are good. But I would just note two things for everyone:",4,1,2020-1-12,1,1,0
I had this processor for 5 days.  I put in a NVME ssd and the processor failed.  I installed a new motherboard and still failed.  Changed power supplies 3 time and failed.  Changed GPU 2 times and still showing bad processor.  Amazon customer service would not replace processor and turned it over to AMD.  Talked to an AMD service representative and got a service request number from AMD and have not heard back.  I have been using AMD processors for over 10 years and this is my first failure.  Customer service is slow if non-existent. It seems the tech I talked to could have resolved the issue but he kicked the issue down the road.  I'm really disappointed in Amazon and AMD.,1,1,2019-10-8,1,3,0
"Well, coming from a PC with an old quad core duo that was a frankenstein of a PC running ubuntu that TBH i never used as it was a P.O.S., ""anything"" made in the past couple years would've made me say wow, but ... holy crap WOW. Not like I needed this high end of a CPU, and to say it handles anything I've thrown at it isn't much to say either, but I ""can"" say it is nice to have something this nice for a change. I truely feel this thing will last me quite a while. So far I run e z games on it. Set it in BIOS to run at 1.3V @ 4100Mhz and have no issues on stock cooler so far with what I've run... again, not pressing. Studio One artist with current updates, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, and Tomb Raider Anniversary. NO issues at all. Running with Asrock Master SLI/ac MB, EVGA GTX 1080 card, 16 GB GSkill, stock cooler, 750W PS. LOVE IT!",5,1,2018-5-30,1,5,0
"I was an AMD fan for years but jumped off the train a few years ago in favor of  Intel.  The first gen of the Zen architecture, had some issues, particularly with ram so I held off.  This 2nd gen is fantastic.  I also made the decision to give the included cooler a try after water-cooling my builds for years.  Again, I wasn't disappointed.  The CPU stays in the 30's (C) and it looks cool!  Make sure your motherboard supports 2nd gen Ryzen.  I bought an x470 board so no issues but an older x370 will likely need a bios update.I have played around with overclocking this chip and haven't nearly experimented enough to render a verdict but my quick assessment is there isn't much overhead to do so, certainly not without a superior cooler.  With that said, it performs like a champ right out of the box!  If you don't plan to overclock, maybe look at the 2600 series.",5,1,2018-7-21,1,4,0
"I only have one con, and it's not really much of a con, but installation of the cooler could have been a bit easier.  I don't love the bracket design they've got going on, the lever to tighten it feels a bit flimsy even if it isn't really.  I wish they had stuck to the simple four screws method around the CPU.Other than that, this processor is absolutely wonderful, and the stock cooler is very powerful and absolutely silent.",5,1,2018-12-21,1,4,0
I did take off one star for ease of use - as the cooler clamp is a bear and a half to install.  I bought an aftermarket cooler to avoid this (I literally thought I would break my last motherboard while installing the cooler clamp bracket).AMD has heard complaints about this for years - but has not changed this very hard to install cooler clamp bracket and the fan is too noisy - compared to aftermarket.  That is a shame.  the cooler is great and in my case a waste.  Plan on getting an aftermarket one for ease of use.,4,1,2019-1-17,1,3,0
"I bought this as part of some component upgrades, thinking it would help turn my PC into a space heater for my dorm (just in time for winter). Unfortunately, the stock cooler that came with it works so well that I can now chill beers on top my case. 0/10 would never buy again.",5,1,2018-10-24,1,5,0
"The first PC I ever built I used an AMD Athlon processor in, and I loved it. When I found out about the Ryzen processors I was excited to see what they could do, and I was not disapointed. This chip feels very compitent. I put it into a gaming system, and I have had no issues with it. I also like the cooler. It looks good, and seems to function well. My only complaint about this setup is the factory applied thermal compound. I know, wipe it off and apply third party, but Im not over clocking, so I figured it would work for my purposes, and I was not disapointed, that is untill I had to swap a faulty motherboard. When I removed my cooler, it pulled the whole chip out of the socket. I was terified thinking it had dammaged something. Thankfully all pins were in place. Then came the hard part. It turns out that the factory thermal paste had spread all across the chip, and melted down the sides. I have never seen factory paste do that. The real problem though was that it somehow formed a sort of glue that had now bonded the CPU and cooler togather. They were not coming appart for anything (at least anything I was willing to try on my $300+ chip). Eventually I was able to disolve the thermal paste and save my chip using some very light heat and a little alcohol and a piece of dental floss. Aparently this happens more often then I had realized because there was a whole subredit about how to fix it (Thank you Redit ;-) . In the end it all worked out well and I have everything back up and running in my new MoBo. It was just an experience I will not forget.",4,1,2019-3-11,1,6,0
"Got this during Black Friday 2019 for $160. It was an unbeatable deal. I just looked at the R5 3600 like ""sorry buddy, I want you but lol...they're making it difficult."" I know they usually say the extra 2 cores work well for streaming so I did some twitch streaming @60fps 720p high video bitrate over wifi just to see how it handled it. Had several of my friends tune in including myself from another device. Stream was flawless. Meanwhile the game I was running was Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown. 1440p, completely maxed out graphics locked at 60fps. Didn't check the results without a cap while streaming but I know that when I was playing off stream and removed the cap I was getting like 170fps. I paired it up with a Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT.  It's a match made in heaven and the RGB of both the CPU and GPU are glorious.I've yet to find any reason to overlcock this CPU. It destroys everything I throw at it. Afterburner shows that the CPU handles itself nicely, boosting up to 4.2Ghz when it needs to, and coming back down to 3.7Ghz. I've never seen it hit 4.3Ghz on its own but like I said, when all your games get FPS like that at stock with those resolutions & graphics settings, what's the point? Emulators get devoured too. Wii U, PS3, Wii/GameCube, PS2 etc, just straight devoured. Breath of the Wild running at 4K@60 like.....""WASSUP?"" Not to mention CEMU 1.17.1 is dropping very soon and we're gonna see an even bigger boost in performance for AMD users. I always see the argument about ""get the R7 2700X over the R5 3600 only if you stream"". No bro, just get it cuz it's cheaper, has more cores, and has a monster heatsink. The gaming performance you're gonna lose is extremely negligent. Check out the testers on youtube.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,1,0
"I just upgraded from a 1700X to a 2700X. With stock clocks, under a full load, the 2700X clock speeds (4Ghz) are 500Mhz faster than with my 1700X (3.5Ghz). And DDR4 memory speed was able to be increased from 2933 to 3200Mhz using 4 x 8GB DDR4 modules. Both of these improvements made the upgrade worth it to me. Turn on Gaming Mode through the use of AMD Ryzen Master Utility and CPU clock speeds increase dynamically up to 4.3Ghz! Needless to say, AMD has outdone themselves this time. I'm very happy with my decision to upgrade :DPROs",5,1,2018-4-24,1,4,1
"Upgraded to the AMD Ryzen 7 2700x from my old Intel i7 3770k. My old system could still handle gaming and proccessing ok, But i always notices my CPU at Idle would be utilizing 20-30% of its resources. This chip completely destroys anything I throw at it with ease and it does not even break a sweat. Not only is this chip great for gaming but other multitasking.

"First AMD processor I have put in my system in a very long time, have been using Intel exclusively for the last several system upgrades. I am glad I made the switch. The first thing that I noticed was that multi-tasking is noticeably faster. I don't detect any noticeable difference in games as far as fps goes.I put this proc in a MSI x470 Carbon Pro motherboard. Put a Corsair H75 water cooler on it. Installed some ripjaws 3200 ram and this system runs perfectly. Using HWiNFO64 to log my temps, I have never seen the CPU hit the 70 C mark, even after several multi hour long gaming sessions. This was not the case for my intel system with the same cooler. It would often get close to 80 C and cause hiccups when I was playing a game and trying to stream at the same time.",5,1,2018-6-16,1,6,0

"Bought this as an upgrade from a Core i5 4690K. The difference is night and day. I can't speak for overclocking as I'm waiting for the AM4 bracket for my AIO cooler to come in. The included cooler feels like it's got a nice build quality. I don't care for RGB lighting everywhere but, if you are a fan of it, then this is a nice looking cooler to go in your case.I'm getting consistently smoother frames in Overwatch and FFXV. In Overwatch I would dip from 144Hz to 60-70 in the intense fights. I haven't seen my frames drop at all since getting this new CPU. FFXV is seeing a higher framerate overall, also with no dips from what I can see. With my old 4690K my CPU was at 90-100% usage just from running OW, FFXV, and PUBG (haven't tested PUBG yet). If Avira or MBAM decided it wanted to scan in the middle of a game.....consoles would get better frame rates. There's no doubt anymore with this processor. I setup Plex Media Server and was streaming two videos from it and didn't notice any degradation on my games. The headroom on this is amazing.",5,1,2018-5-14,1,4,0
"This is one more victory for team red. I never thought that I would live to see the day where I could purchase an eight core, 16 thread processor that can comfortably sustain a 3.9ghz o.c. on an air cooler for under $200. There was once a time where the perception was that AMD was for the budget pc user/gamer that couldn't necessarily afford an Intel cpu. Well, those days are officially behind us because the Ryzen series is leaving intel in the dust. On Cinebench, running at 3.9ghz, this processor scored a 3961, and in doing so, outperforms several i7 processors. Although, for single core applications, intel chips tend to have a narrow lead, in multithreading, Ryzen blows comparable intel chips away.

"I am fortunate to live near a MC so I have been rocking a Ryzen 5 1600 that I picked up for $70. It was a great upgrade from my old i5 2500K and I have had no issues with it at all. This 2700x went on sale at MC for $129 but Amazon is only $135 after 15% back on my Prime CC. Saves me time, gas, and toll. Plus I sold the Xbox Game Pass and free game already, as well as my Ryzen 5 1600, making my out of pocket cost on this 2700x upgrade only $50. Amazing deal.Processor is blazing fast. I gained two more cores and 4 more threads, as well as a PBO capable processor. Make sure to upgrade your motherboard bios to the latest possible prior to upgrading if you are coming from a 1st gen Ryzen setup. Dropped the new processor in and booted with no issues. I was stuck at 3.4 GHz on the old Ryzen 5 1600, topping out at 3.8 GHz on a manual overclock. I'm getting 4.25 GHz on all cores now with PBO.

"7/15/2020 UPDATE: So regarding the whole offset voltage thing. It seems you may find mixed results. Yes the decreased voltage reduces heat. Reduce heat means higher potential clock right? Wrong.In situations where the CPU was already more than capabable of handling itself to where it will not harm itself even running full speed(stock) under heavy load. It changes freq. But the problem comes with the voltage requests of the motherboard. The CPU will also downclock if it does not get the voltage it needs. ""But you just enable PBO!"" Yes that loosens the power caps but remember, volts = watts x amps and amps = watts/volts. So heres how it can possiBly screw you if you don't balance the reduced voltage with the increased amperage.  Your MOBO is still requesting the same stock voltage of say 1.58v(my highest hwinfo64 reading) at 138w(PBOenabled. highest hwinfo64 reading) @ at full load causing almost 95amps draw. And thats a problem vs stock where the lack of voltage isnt causing power demands that just cant be met. Causing downclocking. And also reducing  XFR to almost zero Benifet since the CPU will refuse to clock any higher if it feels any of its parameters that would allow it to aren't Being met. One of which is caused By the reported SV12 Voltage bing lower than the VID. Making the CPU think its reached max power already since hardware limitations didnt allow for an increasing in amps to compensate for the reduced voltage. Which I admit, a good power supply will help reduce the issue.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,3,0

I normally hear headphones during gaming so I can barely hear it, if at all.

Going from """"""eight cores""""""*** To actual eight cores with SMT is night and day.In addition, the included Wraith Prism cooler is a great inclusion. It has ARGB, and will keep your CPU reasonably cool. I ended up replacing mine with a be quiet! Dark Rock Slim, but you really don't need to upgrade if you don't want to.

I mostly use Photoshop, Lightroom CC classic and some other photo editing software suites and while they are not yet fully optimized for multi core operation, I’m better prepared for the future with the 2700X. I use this CPU together with the MSI x470 gaming plus motherboard and it runs without any issues. With the fan that comes with this CPU and without any over cloxking, the standby temperature of the CPU is around 31C which steps up to just below 50F under load. Since I’m not using this system for gaming, I do not really need forced water cooling. The system runs quiet and fast.

I honestly cannot understand where all of the complaints are coming from, since I have installed six different Linux distro's and everything from Windows 7 to the current Garbaggio 10 update and have had no issues whatsoever.

Somehow even existing Windows 10 install did not complain, started without any issues, and did not ask for any new drivers. The improvement in speed is obvious even without running any benchmarks -- stuffs just loads faster and everything seems more responsive (even, again, without re-installing Windows).The reason for one star -- the CPU was advertised with a game bundle at the time of purchase (seller was Amazon). Amazon CS acknowledged this in multiple chats and emails (2 weeks worth of that). The story seems to be that Amazon ran out of game codes and was waiting for more.

"I recently went team red, and am super happy with the results. I have been using an older Intel chip (4790k) and while it wasn't a slouch by any means, it was still showing its age. I was tied to DDR3 RAM and I do dabble in content creation and gaming/streaming. Trying to run everything all together caused some noticeable slowdowns/stutters. I paired this chip with an Asus ROG STRIX X470 board and 16 GB of DDR4 from Corsair. I do have an AIO cooler that I chose to reuse and as such I left the wraith cooler that was included in the box. It does however appear to be a pretty beefy cooler, and not just a basic fan like you would get with an Intel chip. Pay attention to the orientation of the chip before installation, there should be a gold triangle on the corner that coincides with a mark on the board socket. This seems to be where most new builders accidentally damage a pin and you don't want that. Speed wise I saw an immediate jump in terms of how fast rendering happened, and putting load on the chip was like slicing warm butter. Smooth, easily spreadable and loaded with delicious goodness. Benchmarking showed a definite increase in the multicore score compared to my 4790k which is great. I wish I had saved a screencap of each but that didn't occur to me until after I had done the AMD chip. I haven't dabbled in OC this chip yet, I want to do some research to determine the best route to go but I hear it clocks well and can get some great speeds out of it. Overall I am glad I got this, I could have waited for GEN3 Ryzen but I don't mind. I feel like all the bugs got worked out here.",5,1,2019-4-14,1,1,1

Well done AMD!  However, in the last 2 weeks from writing this, the ""Prism"" cooler sounds really bad - like it's about to die.  The video attached lets you hear it.  Sounds like an old diesel engine winding up.  Does this for 2-3 minutes then quiets down.  Have submitted a warranty request for the cooler, it should be under warranty.",5,1,2019-10-8,1,2,0
I currently have built 23 computers with these processors. The installation is really easy and the cooler provided is good enough for the work we do. When I ran a stress test the highest temp I got was 74C. The CPU handles amazingly in gaming and regular work. The price which keeps going on sale is a steal compared to the i7-8700k. Only downside is you have to be careful removing the CPU cooler off the CPU when installed. The Thermal paste used sticks to it like glue so if you don't wiggle it slowly to make them separate you are going to pull both out at the same time possibly damaging the unit.,5,1,2020-1-29,1,2,0
"As you can see, I eventually got an AIO for my CPU. I used the stock cooler for 2 weeks my idle Temps were 45 C and it got in the upper 70s under a load. I used Asus aura sync with the stock cooler, then I moved the cooler in my old PC, my FX-8320 is much cooler and I'm using cooler master's software, I like it more than Asus aura, it has 3 lighting zones the AMD logo, the rings, and the fan. The Ryzen 7 2700x gets up to 65% usage when playing Anthem (Ray-tracing enabled on GPU). I get amazing performance, watch out for TeamViewer if you have it, it used up 65% of my CPU! I don't know how it did that, but I knew it when I reached 100% CPU usage in Anthem. Overall, there are people who say AMD sucks, I'm an AMD fan and it's a good time to be an AMD fan. Their Ryzen CPUs are amazing and way cheaper than Intel. I hope they come up with Ray-tracing for their GPUs that would be a game changer.

The cooler was a little more difficult to install only because I thought I would break it.  There is a latch on the cooler that attaches to the MOBO and you have to apply quite a bit of force for it to snap down.

Nearly instant boot times when paired with an M.2 NVMe drive, and most processes are a breeze.",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0
"I've been an ""intel"" guy my entire life. So when one of my friends recommended this as a close bang for your buck option for gaming I thought he was nuts at first. But it turns out he's absolutely correct. Before my last pc fried I was used to intel and was running an Intel core i5 4570. I think I paid $189 for this on sale? Anyways this thing over clock's based on tempurature so when you use sufficient cooling it's just nuts. With my new setup it rarely gets anywhere over 45 Celsius (running it with an Asus rog b-450f motherboard and rtx 2070 super) when you compare this to the Intel option which I belive was around $500 AND it does not come with a cooler included (which this does) you can't beat it. Save yourself 400 dollars in the long run and accept the general 4 to 9 percent of performance lost tested on many games. Coming from an Intel fan boy building pcs sense the pentium 4 days you will be highly satisfied.",5,1,2019-10-19,1,1,0
"I was an AMD fan back in the begining of the millenium and then they had poor preformance for a while. I recently built my sone a gaming computer with a Ryzen 5 1500X and it has been great. Its a great chip that has been preforming at a phenominal rate, especially for the price. I needed to build a new PC for video creation/editing and some light gaming. So, I went with the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X because of the great performance of my sons Ryzen 5 and the price point. This chip is a BEAST!!! I have significantly shortened my video rendering times and it doesnt flinch at the task. I havent messed around with overclocking yet and I am not sure I will have to for what I need it for. This chip is significantly up to the tasks I have in store for it. The price is cheaper than the Intel i7 8700K and I believe it benchmarks higher for multi-core processing in comparison. The one thing I will say about the AMD Ryzen CPU's is they are finicky about working with different RAM modules and rely on them heavily for computing. So ensure that you research the MOBO QVL abd CPU QVL to get the correct memory. I am definitely TEAM AMD!!!",5,1,2018-11-15,1,0,0
"This chip successfully blends gaming performance with streaming/multicore workload performance for a lot less than the  competing 9900k. If you are just going to game, I wouldn't recommend it. However, if you are a streamer/content creator who also wants to snag some pretty cool frames in games, this is for you.With many games, the cpu usage rarely goes above 50%, and even while running obs at the same time it keeps on rolling. The only game I have had a problem with is GTA V, of all games. When loading, the game takes all the cores that it can get, despite being over 5 years old. Once loaded in, its better, though  it still takes up a lot more cpu than makes sense. In RS2 Vietnam, for example, the cpu is rarely utilized to more than 30%, even with discord, chrome, and a bunch of other processes going. This makes me think GTA is an anomaly.",5,1,2018-12-9,1,2,0
"When Ryzen first released, I bought the 1600x to replace my Intel, it was much better than my Intel (I had an older i5 that was OC'ed to the max). One of my friends told me about the price drop on the 2700X so I decided to jump on it, I am so glad I did. I can't believe the performance gains over my 1600X. If anyone is looking to build a gaming PC for medium dollars, I would highly recommend this processor and the Gigabyte Aorus X470. My benchmarks with this MB and processor W/O any OC is a lot faster than my 1600X, even in single core benchmarks (which is the only place my 1600X didn't do great). I can't comment on longevity yet, but I am very, very happy with what I have here.",5,1,2018-10-26,1,1,0
"With eight cores and multithreading, you'll have no shortage of CPU for your average productivity and videogame needs. The stock cooler on this thing puts every other stock cooler to shame. The cooler is easily worth 35-50 dollars on it's own, featuring RGB lighting, and cooling that ACTUALLY WORKS. You'll be getting temps of 35 up to 70 celsius. That's amazing for being a stock cooler. I didn't even buy a real cooler for it because of how good the stock is. If you're going to be doing some moderate to high overclocking, you will want a better cooler though. It's unfortunate this cooler uses that *HORRIBLE* latch system. Also a bit unfortunate because of infinity fabric, ram speeds appear halved.",5,1,2018-11-9,1,2,0

"This cpu is great, upgraded from the Ryzen 5 1500x.  Installation was smooth and seamless. Read the description of this product and make sure your bios is flashed unless you know you'll be able to boot straight up. There's software to customize the lights but make sure you only install the usb cable to it and your motherboard. If you install both or the rgb cable you won't be able to customize. The lights are just an added bonus but overall it's great. Also be sure you have your retention hooks that came with your board as this uses retention clips.*UPDATE*",5,1,2019-1-12,1,1,1
"There are a lot of complaints that the Wraith Prism cooler is loud. In my experience it's not so much that it's *loud* as that it's very obvious when it changes speed. And unfortunately, with default BIOS and Windows settings, it's going to change speed a lot--BIOS will generally make your fans react immediately to small temperature changes, and under the Balanced or AMD Balanced Window power plans, the OS will constantly cycle the processor frequency up and down at idle, which leads to regular temperature fluctuations, which leads to regular fan speed fluctuations (about one cycle every 10 seconds).My solution was 1) to set the ""step up time"" and ""step down time"" BIOS fan settings to the maximum values MSI would allow, and 2) to configure my fan curve to maintain a constant 40% until 60C (it only gets that hot under heavyish load), and then ramp steadily toward 100% at 80C. Those two things together keep it unnoticeable most of the time.",5,1,2020-2-28,1,0,1

Can't happier with the value I get out of AMD for my business machine builds. IMPORTANT NOTE: Be aware that this CPU does NOT have an onboard graphics processor. That means that you will have to install a graphics card in order for your computer to work. I recommend a graphics card for any and all users including business software users. Much of software today is actually more graphics intense and a decent graphics card will help you drive multiple monitors for more efficiency and helps ""smooth"" out applications, decrease load times, increase overall productivity and it's plain old better to have dedicated devices.",5,1,2019-2-20,1,0,0

Ok gonna be completely honest with this review. Value per dollar as of the time of I’m writing this it’s been about 3 weeks with the processor. I love it so far for virtual machines I can run 2 virtual machines at once for work. If you actually have a need for the extra cores by all means 10 out of 10 price to performance for things that Need more threads and more cores can take advantage of that shear processing power if you have the extra budget go for the 3600x or better but if your budget is 160 then this is the best bang for your buck,5,1,2019-12-21,1,2,0
I finally got my computer connected up and I booted it. I looked at the monitor and it displayed the message “CPU not installed properly”; then I took proper steps to take out my CPU and install it back in and it does not go in properly. I take a look and check the chip and see it has a few bent pins. I then email AMD support to see if the warranty might cover it and it takes literally 2 weeks before AMD support tells me that the warranty will not cover it and tell me to go to a local hardware store to fix it. 2 WEEKS and I still have not gotten my computer setup. Literally they could’ve told me that on DAY 1. AMD has more stuff that they don’t cover than they do. Shady company with little interest in consumer rights.,1,1,2019-12-10,1,2,0
"Do not purchase this thinking you're going to overclock it. It's honestly pointless for the trouble you will go through for less than 8+ fps at least gaming wise. I could not get anything stable at 4.3ghz under 1.4v, so I was stuck at 4.2, and when it was overclocked my cores we're still fluctuating between 2200 to 4200 on ryzen master, I cannot figure out why that is. I returned everything to stock and now under boost it hit 4.3 GHz but voltage peaked at 1.5v and crashed on division 2. I have owned it for 1 day and have had nothing but a headache so far, kind of regret not going the Intel route, I returned this cpu as well as the x470 rog strix f gaming mobo, not worth the headache and dislike rog bios , instead opting for a 2700 and an msi board and possibly not liking that either and just go for Intel.",3,1,2019-5-31,1,1,0

Also, if you want to control all of the colors on both the fan and the ring, you will need to connect a little cable to it and plug it into a USB slot and not all of the MBs have two free USB plugs inside you may need an internal usb hub.

"What I've always loved about Ryzen CPUs is their value compared to Intel. AMD is comparable to the 8700k (~$360), and some even consider it to be on par with the 9700k (~$420 on Amazon). Upgrading from a 1600 (on one computer) and 2600x (on another) is a breeze. Why? AM4 compatibility, which is something Intel decides not to do. Want to upgrade to Ryzen 2 (TBA at CES)? Just take off your cooler, take your current CPU out, and put this new one in WITHOUT the hassle of dropping another $190-$290 on a new motherboard. The 2700x even comes with a cooler, which the 9700k does not have, and a fine cooler at that. An aesthetically pleasing cooler and fully functional one that keeps one of my 2700x under 73C  with Precision Boost 3 (which goes up to 5Ghz for me). My other 2700x is AIO water cooled, and can push out up to 6.5Ghz (on all cores) with Precision Boost 2 at 70C-80C.This CPU at idle gives out 2% usage, which I took for granted until I looked at an i5 8400(?) which idled at 20%. Also, Ryzen Master, beautiful work of art. Instead of restarting my computer a million times to get a stable clock, I can just go into Ryzen Master, increase core clocks until it crashes, then raise the voltage and find a stable clock speed. Or you can leave it to Precision Boost 2, but I like to run my CPU at 4.2 Base with Precision Boost 2 enabled.",5,1,2019-1-2,1,0,1

I am not a very heavy user but I really prefer the fast multi-tasking speeds that Ryzen offers. Keep note that when you are going to buy this you are giving up some gaming performance compared to Intel's counterpart (In this case i7-8700K) but you are paying $100 less than what that would have cost.

This chip is awesome! 1806 Cinebench score with NO overclock! Rendering photos and videos are a lot quicker than my old outdated x58 i7 920 CPU (still on of my favorite chipsets though). It was worth the upgrade. Gaming isn’t as good as the intel i7 8700K (depending on who you talk to) all the FPS benchmarks I’ve seen are within the margin of error. This is cheaper than the i7 8700K,5,1,2018-9-26,1,2,0

Awesome CPU and an excellent upgrade from my Ryzen 7 1770 CPU. This one has a base frequency of 3.7Ghz but it runs in my ASUS B350M-A motherboard at a constant 4Ghz!

"After trying 3 different coolers on this thing, it seems to run very hot. However after obsessing about my temps for so long, I decided to ignore them. I'm still playing at 1080p and this cpu is more than enough for that. The CPU doers run noticeable hotter than Intel. This doesn't bother me anymore though and for the price, you are getting a really good processor and it allows you to spend more money on a GPU. I gave 4 starts to stability, because this is the x version.  It constantly jumps in temps and usage. I get a sawtooth temperature graph. Even when my PC is idling, the CPU is going nuts sometimes.

I absolutely love my Ryzen 7 2700x. This is the best value for the buck at this price range. It performs well and overclocks well and I seldom get close to the limits of its power. The cooler that comes with the CPU is just another bonus add-in that you won't see Intel throwing in with their CPU's. I will be with AMD and their Ryzen platform for a long time.,5,1,2018-10-14,1,2,0
"This CPU is unarguably great, but the cooler that comes with it is not so good.  As you can see in the picture I am accompanying, the bottom of the cooler which makes contacts with the face of the CPU is not entirely flat.  There are grooves between heat pipes.  If this cooler was to be a decent one, there won't be any such grooves between the heat pipes at the bottom.  The bottom is to be entirely flat.  Thermal compound comes between the cooler and the face of the CPU, but the compound is not designed to fill these giant gaps.  And, also movement of the cooler will also add to the problem.  the latching mechanism of this cooler doesn't securely fix the cooler and allows movements of the cooler in relation to the CPU.  If AMD is willing to send me a decent CPU cooler for free, I will gladly accept it.",4,1,2019-11-21,1,0,1
Haven't had an AMD processor since the Athlon X2 series on the 939 socket.  This was used to replace an Intel i5-4670K system.  As well as consolidate two computers into one.  BIG BIG difference!  The new 2700X system is a dual purpose Python development/gaming system.  The extra cores are a night and day difference for the former.  This thing can run a Linux VM crunching data and storing that within a local database and play a game at the same time while I wait!  If you need the extra threads just grab this CPU and spend the extra money saved on more RAM or a better GPU.,5,1,2019-1-6,1,1,0

I'd recommend the Ryzen 7 2700 over this if it's on sale or the Ryzen 5 2600(x) if you want to spend a $100+ less and don't mind overclocking/having two fewer cores.AMD has made a very strong comeback and they aren't cutting corners like Intel by not including a stock cooler (or including garbage coolers), making the PCB thinner, and using thermal paste instead of solder for the IHS.",5,1,2018-10-1,1,1,0
"With Intel, you'd have to change motherboards every generation. AMD promised to support AM4 till at least 2020. Would highly recommend over Intel, especially if you're gaming at a higher resolution (1440p, 4k) due to being more gpu bound. Plus you won't notice the 35fps difference going over 100+ fps (AMD) and 125-40 fps (Intel). No noticeable difference in frametime either, so save your money and use it where it really counts, your graphics card",5,1,2018-12-30,1,3,0
"Really easy to install. you do not need thermal paste.  Its temperature is normal and very quite cooling fan and RGB is beautiful.

I missed them dearly and was tired of Intel.Little more than a year later (2 weeks ago) my computer started boot looping. I thought for sure, oh this must be my hard drive or RAM. Replaced both, still boot looping. Okayyy let's replace the motherboard. *Still boot looping*. I replaced every part in my PC until I finally replaced this CPU. After doing that my computer is back in order. I'm stunned. No nerd friend of mine has *ever* had a CPU die on them in their life, let alone within the span of 2 years.",1,1,2020-8-17,1,1,0
"This is an awesome chip! It'll run any new games very well with a decent graphics card of course. Everyday tasks will be a snap, and it will chew through some workstation applications effectively, as well! I actually chose to purchase a gen 3 Ryzen 5 3600 over this chip, as they were nearly identical in price. The 3600's more efficient cores, and newer architecture won the day for me, and I lost very little in workstation abilities as a trade-off. The ability to OC the 3600 is also a plus, although it won't tweak too high. Either way, between the 2700, 2700X and the 3600 lies a fairly close window of usability and price.",5,1,2019-11-25,1,0,0

So the wife won out got the new pc and I am riding my pc another year out.If you are going from a 6 or earlier Intel or fx cpu then its a worthy upgrade and affordable vrs Intel, but if you are in the 7gen Intel keep what you got and save your money till either manufacture comes out with something that is a major improvement.

These aren't the absolute fastest parts, but the price came in about $300 less than a build with an Intel chipset for comparable performance. Typical workloads include lots of compilation (gcc), Blender, VirtualBox VMs, docker, Lightworks video editing, and other development tasks. Under moderate load the fans tick up, but it runs cooler than the box it replaces though it's easily twice as fast.I don't play games on this, but it can render a moderately complex Blender 3D scene in about 45 minutes.",5,1,2019-5-15,1,0,0

The A10 APU didn’t turn out to be the best fit for me. The Ryzen 7 2700X is a perfect fit though. It’s fast! It was inexpensive compared to Intel, yet offering great performance.

I was going to get the ryzen 5 since they were cheap but somehow I got this instead. The stock cooler is loads better than the other intel and lesser ryzens but I need to apply some better thermal paste.

It comes with a neat programmable LED fan that requires AMD's software for it. I didn't bother with it, looks fine as it is. Worthy of notice is the fact that the 1600x was bottlenecking the 2070, which is why I bought this.

Recently decided to try AMD for the first time mostly because of my budget and a recommendation from a friend. I use to have an Intel Core i5 4690k @ 3.50GHZ and was looking to upgrade my rig but my budget was roughly $600.. Was going to originally buy an Intel Core i5-9600K 3.7 GHz 6-Core Processor - That was priced at $250 but was told by multiple friends that the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X is equivalent to an Intel Core i7 and some online posts have said that the performance on the Ryzen 7 is actually better - And all for the price of $250 the same price as the Intel i5 I was going to buy..Fast forward a week and I got my Ryzen 7 2700x with my new motherboard! I've been told the con to buying an AMD is that they get really hot - I was idling around 55-65*C  and when I played Rainbow Six Siege or any high demanding game it would jump to 86*C - The Wraith Prism LED Cooler is not ENOUGH for this Ryzen 7.,5,1,2019-8-12,1,0,1

It was easy to install, it seems to do a decent job at keeping the 2700x cool, and it looks cool with the LEDs. Some have complained about the noise, but for me it's not bad at all. The Corsair AIO I had in my previous build was quite a bit louder. I was planning on going with a new AIO for this, but I may have second thoughts after seeing the Prisim Cooler in action. So far I have yet to see the CPU temps go over 55c.",5,1,2019-3-15,1,0,0
I am running this processor in a PC running Zorin Ultimate (Ubuntu 16.04 based) and it is running grate.  I do a lot of video encoding with this PC and use my PC as a media server with Serviio.  I can encode a high def video in little time and standard def video in a few minuets.  I use it with Handbrake and my new PC with this processor has been way out preforming my old one.  I would recommend this processor to Linux builders who are wanting to do video or other types of encoding.,5,1,2018-12-17,1,1,0
"Let me begin by saying that I am a AMD fan, always have been. But that is not relevant here. If the processor was a piece of garbage I would tell you. I changed my setup from a FX-8350 black to this chip mainly because the 8350 was getting its but handed to it by the most recent game titles. It was a very reasonable price so I took the plunge, and I'm glad I did. This chip is FAST. I have had absolutely no problems with it. I play all my titles on ultra now and it doesn't break a sweat. I highly recommend this processor to everyone. Also, as a side note I  have the Wraith Prism RGB cooler that came in the box with it and it is whisper quiet even though I have a moderate overclock on the chip.",5,1,2019-11-21,1,0,0
"I stopped buying amd products long time ago, but I know they have made a huge step forward and I wasn't disappointed, this 2700x is awesome, quite, fast and not that hot, it comes with a cooling fan which is great, 82 degrees on rendering, happy with it",5,1,2018-8-25,1,2,0
"After countless BSODs and multiple trips to local computer repair stores, it was finally determined that my CPU was faulty. Amazon processed the return for me, but I was outside the 30 day window and had to pay a restocking fee.

"AMD has been a standard for me in building PC's for over 20 years.  Some say they are slower than INTEL but I haven't stood by with a stop watch yet to time them.  However, since the AMD Athlon in 1999 I've been sold on the ability to overclock and use to play gaming, or just use as a matter of a regular computer.  I've never had a bad AMD CPU yet.  I've had motherboards go out and other components fail but I have always had good service with AMD CPU's.",5,1,2020-2-27,1,0,0
"I had not owned an AMD CPU in over 10 years. I am pleased with the capabilities and performance of the Ryzen series.  It was a noticeable improvement in the way it handled my video games effortlessly without the usual lag. I am not one to quote specs since I am all about the end result which is ""noticeable improvement!"" This CPU handles multiple threads and background processes compared to my previous multi-core processor. I am pleased!",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0

"I got this CPU for $160 on sale, which too me was a Killer deal. It has twice the cores of any CPU I ever owned before it and it destroys games at 1440p when paired with a good graphics card and fast RAM. Mine has its RAM clocked at 3600MHz and I paired it with an RX 5700. The included cooler is also real good for being stock. Under full load I peak in the mid 70s. Cooling still could be better, I am planning on getting a 240mm AIO, but this one is fine if you aren't Overclocking much.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,1
Never built a desktop before now but I wanted something that could do a ton of things at once and this is what I hoped for and got. Sure the i7-8700K may be better for gaming but sometimes I like editing videos at the same time as playing games and this does it well. The prism cooler is tough to install on a Gigabyte Gaming motherboard but that's the only gripe I have and it's probably not the cooler's fault.Overclocks to 4.0GHz out of the box and plays Ghost Recon Wildlands at 60-80 FPS with a 1070Ti with respectable temps (between 55-65C) so it can handle anything.,5,1,2018-9-23,1,1,0
"This was the first time I've ever installed a processor unit by myself-- installation was a breeze.  It comes with an application of thermal paste directly on the fan unit.  The CPU has been a HUGE improvement over my last build, which was about 7 years old.  It's stable, stays cool under the main CPU fan, as well as my added fans in my tower.  Haven't had any instability issues with it.  If you can afford it, highly recommend it.  With it's 8 cores, it really helps my render times and polycounts for my 3D modeling (Zbrush in particular)",5,1,2019-4-1,1,2,0
I would’ve been thrilled with this purchase with the performance with all of it if I wasn’t sold a returned item you could tell it had been reopened and repackaged that wouldn’t have bothered me if there wasn’t any issues with the item itself but upon opening the box the cpus pins were gunked with cpu cooling compound from a previous owner no clue I thought I was buying a brand new item but I guess I was wrong I finally managed to clean off all the thermal paste and it works great but for the price I paid there’s no excuse for any issues like this.,1,1,2020-4-8,1,1,0
decided to build a mid-range gaming computer as a possible gift for my grandson. ZERO issues during the build or since. I'm not a hardcore gamer so I'm not stressing it at all.Just have a low-end video card in it right now. Will be interesting to see how it does when pushed. The .m2 SSD is fast but could be bumped up if I wanted to spend a lot more money. Am very happy with current configuration. Not overclocked so it's very stable.,5,1,2019-4-21,1,0,0
"When I was doing research on this processor, a lot of resources told me it would cut the performance of my 1080 Ti in half. What I found is that when I overclocked the Ryzen 7 2700x to 4.1 ghz, that it was almost the exact same as a an Intel CPU, just with more cores and better for multi-threaded applications. However, the reason I give it 4 stars or gaming and not 5 is because although it performs well in gaming, Intel still beats it. These Ryzen chips are great for people who want to game and work on their systems. If your a person who ONLY plays games, then get an Intel. But if you game AND do other things this CPU is 100% for you!",5,1,2019-1-3,1,1,0
"I'm a hobbyist. I hated my AMD FX in 2012 and I've been running Intel systems ever since but this time around I decided to break the mold. Couldn't be happier with my choice. AMD is clearly dominating the consumer-facing game right now and the quality-to-price ratio of their products is absolutely unbeatable. I bought this CPU for $200 on sale and I am confident it will last me 5 years if I want it to. Automatic overclocking, four times the thread count of my Intel i5 4750, a great stock cooler...impossible to regret this purchase.",5,1,2019-9-11,1,1,0

"Consistently and reliably boosts to or a little beyond advertised turbo speed of 4.3 GHz. Staying cool for me so far with included stock cooler, which cooler is beautiful and was easy to install on my B450 motherboard. This 2700x would be perfect for anyone considering anything from a mid-tier to enthusiast build. I spent more than the $300 I spent on this CPU to get a 1070ti, and even with GPU overclocking my 1070ti will bottleneck in intensive games long before this CPU on stock settings. I've had some reservations about all the various components of my current build... except for my choice in CPU. Gaming, desktop, and workstation use, I fully recommended this. Especially for the price which includes the cooler. You'll have to spend ~$100 more with Intel to match the performance, and then $30-50 more on a cooler.",5,1,2019-1-30,1,0,1
"Used to be an Intel guy, but AMD has won me over. Fantastic CPU, despite running quite hot under load. Stock cooler is sufficient, but your temps will still be rather high, especially in smaller cases. There's a 'high' setting switch on the cooler that significantly improves cooling ability, but then it gets a bit too loud. Nice that they included that though still.",4,1,2019-6-8,1,0,0
"I bought this for a build I was putting together for my fiance. She doesn't need something this strong, but there was a special at the time that allowed me to get a copy of Borderlands 3 for free with this model. I decided to spend the extra $40 to upgrade to this processor - since my original choice didn't include the game, and I was going to get the game anyway, this made more sense.However, when I tried to redeem the game, their rewards system would not give me the game.

"My first build in over 30 years.  My msi board had a slot for video.  My video card was coming in a day after I had most of my parts. So I put everything in to give it a test drive.  No video.  I scratched my head for a while, and googled it a lot.  Finally figured out the CPU doesn't have on board graphics.  When the video card came, problem solved.  Not to mention, it clearly states in the CPU box, no video graphics on CPU.  Hopes this helps someone else a little.  Otherwise, awesome CPU!",5,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
Used this in my first pc build. It is an amazingly powerful CPU with 8 cores and 16 threads. I have done some gaming and general multitasking and it has muscled through everything without breaking a sweat. Especially for the price I will likely use it for my next build as well. If you need a good CPU for gaming or office work this is the one for you.,5,1,2020-1-13,1,0,0
"Super value for nice speed with good core and thread count.Only reason I dropped a star is the retaining lever to tighten the retaining clip on the Wraith cooler was a bit .. cheap on the plastic.

"This thing is an amazing deal for $200. I know the price goes up and down, but I scored one with the RGB cooler for $200 and haven't looked back. It's half the price of most i7 chips and does more work in multi-threaded (6+ core) applications. It's also fast enough for gaming that you're not going to notice a difference between this chip and an Intel. Buy it already.",5,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0
The value for this processor is great. I have been an Intel guy for a decade or so but when building a computer for my kid I really wanted to give him something great but didn't have enough money to go with the Intel.  The processor was worth it and it works great.  I don't ever overclock and the fan that came with the processor is awesome. This is by far the best stock fan I have ever seen. My kid loves it too because it has the RGB lights on it.  I am considering building a new computer for myself with this processor.,5,1,2019-10-6,1,0,0
"This is an awesome CPU. I haven't over clocked it yet, still working on my cooling system, might go to a kit water cooler for over clocking. Not sure yet. Runs great so far though. Even without water cooling the fans are keeping it where it needs to be with only a bit of noise when I really push it.UPDATE: Almost 2 years now and still going strong. I am really stuck since I just don't see the point to moving past this setup since I don't game. It is just that good. Asus x470-F MB, 2700x CPU, 32GB RAM, 2TB 970 Plus M.2 and XFX 580.

"Upgraded from a 4.7 GHz FX8350, my GPU is no longer bottle-necked by my CPU. This upgrade alone boosted my FPS 30 or more. Even though this is not a gaming CPU, I picked it up for gaming.

Wraith cooler reaches uncomfortable temps with this CPU, I wouldn't recommend using it for long.I mean, it can be used for gaming, I just did not want to get a 3rd gen so soon.

"The CPU arrived dead (with sketchy packaging and not looking brand new!) and the stock cooler was physically damaged under the fan upon opening the box.

If you're doing any serious work with this CPU I reccomend getting a water cooler.

"Bought as I was beginning a new build moving away from my previous FX8350 build completed in 2016. Waited for these 2nd gen Ryzen's to come out and have not regretted it. At the time when I purchased was about $200 cheaper than a 8700k Intel and as I originally wanted to do a entirely AMD/ATI build went with the AM4 platform. Haven't really got into overclocking it yet, mainly left it at the stock settings; however plan on tinkering a bit with that as I have upgrade the PSU as well. Only con I could think of is that Wraith cooler. On the cooler it has a JRGB & a internal USB connection. After connecting everything as instructed I couldn't get the MSI mystic light app to change the color of the fan. After multiple updates it now works; however randomly throughout using the pc during the day I'll hear a USB/disconnects which is a bit wierd.",4,1,2018-12-3,1,0,0

Way faster then my ryzen 3 first generation! Love this thing! Although the temps on this thing are way hotter in idle and in general then last generation.

I got this beast for $200 and i was like wow this perfomance for just this i was so impressed that i use to have an intel i5 9400f and it was for the same price and i can see the difference from a intel to amd. I have GTX 1660TI (GPU). 16gb ram 2400hz. RM 750x (PS) and a gigabite b450 dsh3 (motherboard). If you are planning to build a gamig pc i really recommend this CPU.,5,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
AMD hasn't seen a good oveecllocking chip since the Duron 600. I've been using them since the super 486  chips were around. I did managed a 4.2Ghz @ 1.4v OC but that isn't even turbo speed. Ryzen has given team red the chip we have been waiting for but as usual falls just short of truely competing with team blue. AMD for life.,5,1,2019-4-5,1,0,0

Good,5,1,2019-12-13,1,1,0
"Even with this generation of Ryzen, buying intel instead of buying a 2700x is just financially irresponsible. This processor is amazing and even with my Radeon VII it never gets pushed past 25-30% cpu usage when gaming, meaning it will be a long time before this beast needs to be upgraded.",5,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0

"Amazing CPU. Does productivity tasks very well and is good in gaming performance.An added bonus is a very good included stock cooler that has RGB lighting, which is more than adequate for stock cooling. Highly recommend if you mix productivity tasks and gaming.",4,1,2018-12-10,1,0,0
"So far so good. I wasn’t aware that the Heat sink was LED but then again I wasn’t even concerned or looking at the Box and more of what it was capable of and specs all around. It run quiet and sometimes it does get noisy in terms of the fan speeding up due to some high end games and well, running everything on high with Ray tracing on. Overall I am happy with the processor.",5,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"This is bar none, the best CPU out there.  You get essentially identical gaming performance and better performance in every other category than anything Intel has out.  Intel charges twice as much for their new chipset and its the same level of performance.",5,1,2019-2-17,1,0,0

"I use my computer for video editing, I cant rate this for gaming as I dont use it for that. Perfect for editing 4k footage in Premiere. I don't have to use proxy files anymore.

"At this point it may be the top AMD processor that isn't thread-ripper.  If you need value look to a lower model, but its good and its ready made for over-clocking.  It comes with the Wraith Prism cooler which is the best performing of the Wraith series so far.  Good overall value.",5,1,2019-1-6,1,0,0

"I didn't need it, I already had 2 desktops, one with Ryzen 5 1600 and the other with Ryzen 5 2600, both are amazing in performance so to justify buying the R7 2700X but it was on sale for $170... AYFKM?",4,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0

"Everything runs great, easy to install for the most part and the stock cooler handles itself pretty dang well. Although if you switch the cooler from quiet to performance mode it gets about 5 times louder without much of a performance boost that I can see yet so i just keep mine on quiet mode and everything seems to runs smooth and decently cool.",5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"I've gotten 2 of these processors so far and have found them to be powerhouses when it comes to production workloads. In gaming they are on par with some less expensive, fewer core packed packages. As a general purpose processor they may be a bit overkill and they do run a little hot. The included cooler isn't as terrible as most would say but you will also not squeeze the most power out of the cores with it either.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
"Gets a bit hot in my cheap case with the stock cooler and Autooverclocking on with my X470 board. Runs great in PUBG and R6. Great for multi-tasking, but be sure to have a good case/cooler if you want to really run it hard.",5,1,2018-7-24,1,0,0

It runs a little warm so if you have your own cooler it better be good. At the same time it comes with an amazing wraith prism cooler that is solid alone.,5,1,2019-7-30,1,0,0
"Easily assembled, comes with its own cooling fan.  Very quiet.  Had considered purchasing a bigger aftermarket cooler to allow more aggressive  overclocking, but this wasn’t needed.",5,1,2019-8-5,1,0,0

"Worked well for a year and a half, died randomly, went to restart the computer and cpu died, mobo had a cpu failure code. Put another cpu in there and it started up so I know it’s not a mobo issue. I’m going to try to warranty it but I don’t know how well that’s going to go. Kinda disappointed for less than 2years of use on a decently high end cpu....",3,1,2020-4-5,1,0,0
"It’s Ryzen. It’s perfect. Sure it’s single core isn’t on Par with intel, but it’s not that far off. And it’s multi threaded performance is off the charts and wipes the floor with intel. All for a MUCH cheaper package, cooling solutions, mother boards, etc. 10/10 one of the best purchases I made last year.",5,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
For the price this is 8 core 16 thread. Fast beats the i5 9400f 9th gen. Kills it. This is a great cpu for the price.,5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0
"As it stands, for this price range, AMD Ryzen is the only choice to consider. Comparably performing processors will ccost at least $80 more (from my research at least). It takes a lot of power and runs a little hot, but a decent PSU and fan (which it comes with)should take care of that.",5,1,2019-7-11,1,0,0
"Extremely powerful cpu, used in my second build. To put it short amd sweet, buy it ASAP! This cpu has it all. Not only did I get my Division 2 code but, it can crush whatever you throw at it gamewise. Also, it was very easy to install the fan. My MSI x470 Gaming Plus along with a plethora of AM4 motherboards come with an AM4 bracket pre installed, this bracket is for the stock cooler of the 2700X, the Wraith Prism. Overall, just a really great cpu and I'll reccomend.",5,1,2019-3-26,1,0,0

"Even if you like Intel's processors, nothing beats this ryzen 7 2700x. No i7 processor has a better value than this $150 beast. I upgraded from an i5 6500 and this immediately showed much better performance on some of my previous games that I ran. It also was able to render 4k footage more efficiently than I was able to before. I'm very satisfied with the money spent on this amazing processor.",5,1,2019-12-25,1,0,0

I combined it qith the asus crossfire hero vii mb. Runs great easy setup.",5,1,2018-6-26,1,0,0
I have yet to see this thing hit 100% and I’ve run it as hard as I can. I see no reason to overclock this cpu because it runs so fast and smooth on the stock settings. Using the stock cooler at this point and have no issues getting too hot.,5,1,2019-8-20,1,0,1

"I replaced the 1700 I had in my Asus X370-Pro motherboard with the 2700X and it's been flawless.  Be sure to upgrade your BIOS before replacing the cpu as you might be running a BIOS that can't handle the 2700[X].I did mess around with overclocking but honestly there's no point overclocking the CPU if you have an air-cooled system.  The air cooling that comes with the 2700X is very good and there's no reason to replace it.  If you got the 2700 (non-X) and want to overclock that, you probably want to upgrade from the box cooler.  The 2xxx series CPUS are most sensitive to memory speed, so you will get most of the potential performance boost by buying high speed memory and enabling the profile in the BIOS (be sure to do that as stock settings will run the memory at 2133 otherwise).  The XMP2 auto core boosting profile gets you just about all the overclocking that the CPU can do in an air-cooled system without actually overclocking it.  (The 2700 non-X will be different... there O.C. CPU profiles are more useful).",5,1,2018-4-24,1,7,0

Tops the 1700x at its max oc without overclocking. Disappointing OC on X370 Krait board. If you are stepping up with old board you'll likely have to wait for for future bios updates to see its true potential.

XFR2 is amazing, and makes intel's Turbo scheme look amateur by comparison. Though it's most direct competitor, the 8700K is on average 20% faster (Particularly in gaming, so if you just care about Max FPS, probably look into that CPU instead) to get that kind of performance, you have to get really lucky (silicon lottery) or Delid the 8700K to get into 5GHZ territory, or 4.5GHZ All core overclocks.",5,0,2018-4-27,1,1,0
"Best AMD build ever! MB is ASUS Crosshair VII HERO wifi (with latest BIOS). Memory is G.Skill FlareX 3200 CL14.

Memory running at 3200 CL13, which is significantly better than the default XMP settings of the ram. CPU and memory at recommended voltages. Passmark rates CPU performance of this build in the top 1% of the world. Included cooler works good, but is not suitable for serious overclocking like I have described above in gaming or other CPU intensive applications. I don't recommend 3466 DDR4. Buy ASUS QVL 3200 parts only, then tighten the timings for best performance. I also recommend an M2 drive as your boot drive.

I had a b350 and ran into very frustrating problems before a BIOS update (released literally days ago) fixed the issues.

Running at 4.0 base 4.3 boost on my 370 Crosshair 6 Hero. It also idles at 25 degrees and hasn't seen it go much over 50 in limited testing. So far Ryzen 2 looks legit.

"It's a pretty solid CPU with 16 threads on 8 cores which is great if you do any data crunching. Based on cpubenchmarks.net, it's one of the best in terms of bang for your back, and it's pretty close to the market leader in absolute power as well. Unfortunately, both major companies' newer processor are suspect from a privacy/security standpoint, but intel has a much worse reputation in that regard - as far as I know Ryzen doesn't have a remote shutdown feature or a radio in the CPU (intel does, look it up).The biggest negative of this CPU is that it requires an AM4 socket. Which means you also must upgrade your motherboard, which means you have to get new RAM (your old RAMs won't be compatible). This needlessly balloons the cost of upgrading by a few hundred. On its own, that wouldn't so bad - the new architecture is part of how the CPU gets its performance after all. But many AM4 motherboards on the market are trash, even more expensive ones. I had particularly bad experience with ASRock x470 (poor quality, crap drivers, atrocious tech support), often recommended for this CPU, definitely avoid that one and ASRock in general - I suggest getting Gigabyte or ASUS at least.",4,0,2018-12-10,1,2,0

I now have a second machine same build but with 32GB DDR4-3600 both are watercooler with the Cosair H150i my main machine runs Dual 1060 Windforce video cards in SLI, as for my second machine, i've now installed linux, and have over 12 VM (Virtual Machines) running which allowed me to power down my 8350 as the TDP is high on it, I'm also in the processor of moving over all my VM's to this machine which will let me power down my old xeon 2670 (dual) as I run 3 4U Racks at home, they are my developmental servers, and when I'm finished with a project I move it to my dedicated server.My girlfriend said if these go on sale to get 3 more same board 32gb of ram for each.",5,0,2018-11-18,1,2,0
"I love this CPU. I was debating between this CPU and a 8700k and the 2700x was a clear winner after calculating all the part costs needed. First, Intel cpu itself is $30 more than AMD. An Aorus motherboard with 2 x m.2 ssd slots that i need for Raid0 was $23 cheaper for AMD than it was for  Intel. Unlike Intel, AMD comes with a free RGB cooler that looks awesome! A decent cooler for Intel, Hyper 212 evo is another $30. I saved $73 just for going with AMD. Very important is also that Intel runs hotter than AMD by roughly 10 degrees if you compare stock AMD and Hyper 212 evo coolers. Because of the higher running temperature of Intel, the cooler fan on Intel will run faster and be noisier than the AMD on moderate and heavy workloads, Of course i could have water cooled Intel and made it cooler and quieter than the stock AMD cooler but that would be another $70 on top of Hyper 212 evo cooler cost. (+$140 total vs AMD)Another great advantage of AMD is that i can upgrade to the upcoming CPUs with ease until 2020.

I've done a lot of studying on this processer and the 2600X compared them too intel's i7 and i9S while only the 7820X 8 core beats this 1 on a 299x MB total cost about 300 dollars more apples too apples yes there are better AND and Intel processors but then you start too get into Thousands of dollars for things that overkill everything while 90% gamming still using derectX 9 or 11 I get a good laugh at people this is a great buy and when gamming catches up with hardware used in comps you will respect this processer even more unforntualy programming and delevopment isnt up too par with new compouter hardware yet and will always be 4-5 years behind current technology.Amazon has get price on 2700X and 470X gigabyte MB highly recommended too upgrade now.,5,0,2018-5-5,1,2,0
"After finally getting my computer to post after 5 hours of scratching my head, I finally got a chance to see what Ryzen was all about. Maybe the x470 Asus board was defective. Maybe the processor came from a bad batch. Maybe my memory isn't as good as I thought it was. All I know is that I've never had this kind of issue with stability as I did with AMD.I purchased a 2700x along with the Asus x470 Crossfire Hero mobo to replace my i7-6700k and z170 board. I was looking to upgrade my core/thread count without breaking the bank. I already had 32GB of Trident Z 3000mhz that conveniently had Samsung B-die on them.

"I'm impressed with my Ryzen7 2700X.  It definitely makes a difference.  From my i5 system I've had over 4 years I started with a Crucial SSD upgrade, and that made a huge speed difference, and it replicated my hard drive perfectly.  After that I then wanted to upgrade the CPU and graphics.  Got some better deals locally from a large computer chain store.  But the problem with upgrading the CPU here is I needed new motherboard and also new RAM, which makes the whole process more expensive.  Thats really the only downside.  I also added a MSI AMD580X graphics card which was a good deal and is plenty fast for me.  Now some other issues -After the MB and CPU swapout - Microsoft WIndows 10 lost its activation and gives me the message to Activate WIndows, and it won't accept the old key.  My PC has been up for about 9 years now and this is the 2nd motherboard upgrade I've done so my Win 10 was the MS upgrade.  So that is an annoyance but I can still do everything, including updates.  But overall the system is running great and I'm doing games as well as running some VM as well and everything is very quick.",5,0,2018-8-17,1,4,0
Its a great cpu vs the 1800x.  My 1800x was broken and it wouldn't turbo boost at all. so rather than get a 1800x  again i got the 2700x since it was the same price... i see a difference in temps and speeds. way better all around. its a lil harder to cool but mostly i keep it  about 119 f on a 100i v2 coolermaster while i game. i use a 1070ti. i havent tried the cooler the 2700x comes with and i probably wont bother trying.  so if you have a chgoice of a 2700x or 1800x since they are pretty much the same price. get the 2700x. boost speeds are way faster  and overall faster cpu,5,0,2018-5-23,1,2,0
"Decided to go with the 2700x after slot of careful thinking. I think it's the best value for your money when it comes to it's 8 cores and 16 threads. Easy install into a MSI x470 Gaming Plus motherboard and booted up first time no issue. I was also trying to future proof my build and right now for the money Ryzen is the way to go and the extra cores will help with my furure streaming plans and multitasking for years to come. The included Wraith cooler is very nice as well allowing for easy overclocking and great cooling. The fan is very quiet and the rbg is fully addressable in three different zones, the ring, the logo and the fan blade. You can manage your rgb light on the Wraith cooler with a Coolmaster Wraith Prism software that works great",5,0,2019-2-13,1,2,0

"I decided to go with this Processor over an intel 8700k due to price and you know what, I have no regrets. The 2700X comes with its own cooler which helps bring down the cost of my build and couple with a MSI Tomahawk MOBO its been great.A word of advice, the cooler has 2 settings a low and high rpm which is next to the RGB and USB pins. If you decide to run it at high RPM i would recommend removing the AMD sticker especially if yours isn't well centered. On low, the sticker doesn't seem to cause any issues but on high you may develop a rattle when the fan slows down and removing the sticker seemed to help remove the noise. If you hear a rattle from the fan it might be worth a try.",5,0,2019-4-20,1,0,0
"I installed this CPU on an MSI Performance Gaming AMD X470 Ryzen 2 AM4 DDR4 Onboard Graphics CFX ATX Motherboard (X470 Gaming Plus) as a new build.  It was easy to install with a Samsung SSD NVME PCIe 500GB.  Coupled with 64 GB Ram, the PC is lightning fast at first start-up and gaming is at maximum resolution without a problem.The CPU came with a large native fan, easily saving me $50 or more had I bought an Intel chip alone.  The price of this CPU compared to the closest Intel chip is enough to make an AMD buy a no-brainer.  The MB looks great the supportive MSI software is easy to use, OC is stupid easy.  Very happy.  If you install this CPU, go for broke and max out on ram on your MB of choice.  You won't be disappointed.",5,0,2019-1-29,1,0,0
It's fast. Very fast. Way better value than 9900K or anything intel has to offer. Handles everything you throw at it and shines even brighter at multi-threaded apps and multi tasking. Does not throttle. I also like that there's a feasible upgrade path for 2020.,5,0,2018-9-8,1,1,0

Great performance but burned out after only 3 weeks of encoding at stock settings. I constantly monitored temps and at load was only 65-70C so that's wasn't a problem.  Amazon is replacing it but this chip completely burned out on me;  I was running it on an AsRock AB350M.  It is possible the board is to blame as it is one of the crappiest boards I have ever owned. In 20 years of building PCs I have never seen this before.  The chip had a brown burn spot on the pins and smelled like fire as did my entire room.  I ordered an MSI B350 Tomahawk to put the replacement chip into which should be better.  Hopefully this never happens again because the performance was very good.  Should get the replacement in a couple of days.UPDATE:  Changing to 1 star,1,1,2018-6-10,1,2,0

I just put together a 2700x build and I couldn't be happier. My intention was to get the best bang for buck processor that could handle any games I throw at it and also handle some heavy use in music production.For gaming so far it has not even come close to struggling. Paired with a RX580 and 32GB of ram it seems like it will handle anything. Granted I don't game extreme like some people. I have only tested it with Madden19 and CSGO so far but both are maxed out and running flawlessly. I would imagine some of the most intense games will force me to tweak the settings a bit to keep it running smooth but I also only have a mid range GPU in comparison to whats out there.,5,0,2019-3-11,1,0,0

The stock fan is actually quite good for what it is. Although it really isn't capable of over clocking, it definitely preforms well at stock speeds and is very quiet. The dual channel RGB lights are also a nice addition for computer cases with transparent panels, and accepts most RGB adjusting programs, like AURA Sync from ASUS.

Alright so the people saying the 2700x beats the I7 8700k in gaming are wrong. Everything else though it rocks. The single core performance won’t beat a 5hz overclock on the 8700k so for gaming that’s the only reason is beats the Ryzen cpus. But if you are buying a 8 Core 16 Thread CPU. Losing 20 or so FPS at 1080P isn’t the reason you are buying a high core count CPU in the first place.,5,0,2018-4-19,1,3,0

Played with fan curves a bit, which fixed the fan noise, but not the temperature spikes. After some digging in the AMD reddit and forums, the temperature spikes are normal behavior. Just so you're aware if you're coming from Intel. As long as your thermal paste decorating is good, it's seated good, it's normal.

I thought the CPU was dead, but I cleaned off the CPU in alcohol and straightened the pins using a razor blade.

"I could write about how great this cpu is all night but I'll try and keep it short.I upgraded from an 1800x a few months back and i was a bit sceptical at first until i saw the numbers, my cpu will run at 4ghz all day long at extremely low voltage compared to my 1800x, for example i easily sit over 4ghz with my voltage below 1.275v, unthinkable on the 1800x. I decide to stick a h100i corsair cooler on it which almost destroyed my idea of airflow through the case (See pic 2) as i had to put the intake fans at the top because the 240mm radiator was too big to fit in the top of the case, only because the ram slots are quite high on the Asrock x470 Gaming K4. The trouble i have is my 1080ti also has its own radiator so my cases airflow really isn't optimal at all, but it still stays cool at all times. Even with this heatwave through europe the cpu never exceeded 70 °c at any time even without amazing airlow and ambient temps well above 40°c, this thing is a beast! If you want to run anything over 3200mhz ram then please take my advice and make sure the ram is samsung B-die. Im not sure why but ryzen really loves samsung B-die, I had corsair 3200mhz hynix ram that would run on my other b350 board with my 1800x or 2700x but not with the new x470 board, the timings are not right, ended up purchasing G-skill Flare X 3200mhz 16gb instead for ultimate capability. In short, dont believe the doubters, this is insane performance out the box with most ryzen 2700x hitting 4ghz straight out the box with under 1.3v, I mean would you really expect 8 cores to go under 30°c even with power saving off, amd cool and quiet and c6 state off? Im more than happy, I havent even activated precision boost 2 yet and look at those specs, i dont need to! I just let it thrive under 1.3v, its glorious!",5,1,2018-8-23,0,8,1

"This is a great CPU. It offers excellent performance in gaming, productivity, multitasking, and anything else you would like to accomplish. Regarding gaming, this CPU will offer a bit less framerates than the i7 8700K and i9 9900K from Intel, but only when gaming at 1080P. Once you step up to 1440P, 1440P ultra wide, or 4K, these three CPUs will offer the same performance. Some people will say or do whatever possible to discredit AMD, and attempt to dissuade potential buyers from recognizing the value and performance that the Ryzen 2 CPUs offer. There is a deliberate agenda happening to try and stop people from buying any of the Ryzen 2 CPUs. The reality here is, people have now clued in to what AMD has done. These shills can't stop the momentum, and the continuing increase of market share that AMD is gaining. This constant claim that Intel is the ""only real option if you want to game"" is a complete lie. If you game at 1080P, the R7 2700X will be maybe 10 percent slower. If you could get 100 frames at 1080P with your current video card paired with the i7 8700K, this means you will achieve about 90 frames with the R7 2700X with the same video card at the same 1080P resolution. If you game at 1440P and beyond, the R7 2700X will give the same performance as Intel. The lies need to stop.AMD is a great option now in 2018, and people should be thanking them. If it was not for AMD, all PC gamers would still be getting a yearly 4 core, 4 thread i5 CPU and a 4 core, 8 thread i7 CPU from Intel. It was AMD that forced Intel to finally stop their nonsense and offer more cores and threads. The problem now is that Intel feels they can charge almost double the money for the i9 9900K when compared to the R7 2700X, yet while providing only a small performance increase.

"Excellent processor, I decided to take the leap and upgrade from my old faithful, but ageing FX-8350 and i'm glad I did, the difference in performance is pretty great.Just a heads up, use the Ryzen website & motherboard website to check compatibility with your board and RAM as there's a chance your AM4 board may need a bios update for this to work. It can also be fussy with ram compatibility, a website like ukpartspicker can be helpful to help you find a list of compatible components.

"Non c’è tanto da dire.. è un bel procio. Anzi, ha il miglior rapporto prezzo/qualità rispetto ad Intel, che ti farebbe spendere molto di più (anche con scheda madre). Dopo tanti anni AMD si è data da fare con i Ryzen, finalmente torna la vera concorrenza di tempo fa. Diciamo subito come stanno le cose: in gaming è favorita Intel per pochi fps, ma in produzione/rendering e streaming decisamente Ryzen. Ho streammato vari giochi a 1080p@60fps e va liscio come l’olio. Quindi ho preferito fregarmene per quei pochi fps che non mi fanno la differenza, ma ho preferito avere tanta potenza sotto tutti gli aspetti. Riguardo il dissipatore, confermo che stavolta non è il solito di stock che è come se non ci fosse, si comporta molto meglio, ovviamente evitate di overclockare se tenete quello stock; tra l’altro a lato c’è una levettina per settarlo su low o high (la differenza in termini di rumorosità e raffreddamento è lieve), vi consiglio di tenerlo su high. Ricordatevi che Ryzen va benone con RAM ad alta frequenza, se potete prendetene ALMENO da 3000/3200MHz e con poca latenza. Che dire.. se AMD continuerà ad offrire processori di questo livello creando una vera concorrenza con Intel, rimarrò con AMD.",5,1,2018-10-27,0,4,1

In the end i think people are more conscious of how much they are willing to spend on PC parts that have a short life before something newer and faster comes out. I feel that the ryzen 7 2700x is at the correct price point for a top of the range cpu that everyone can get behind on. Not only is it value for money you also get a good cpu fan included.  Not many things will even require 8 cores at the consumer level but this in a way future proofs it.  For me it idles around 30 degrees and when gaming will hit towards 50 degrees.  It doesn't even chug when playing the latest games and can multitask like a octopus monstrosity.  Adding a decent GPU with this makes it in my opinion the best Combo for value at the top range,5,1,2018-12-17,0,1,0
"I got this cpu once the 3000 series came out and got it at the cheaper price.So far I had no problems .

Very affordable with 8 cores running at 3.7 Ghz (can go up to 4.3Ghz I believe but I do not have an AIO to keep the CPU cool). It is of older architecture but the price to performance cannot be beat.

Arrived a day early from the seller. Easy install and the Default fan is more than capable of cooling for games like warzone.

8 cores 16 threads at a great price.

"Provengo da un Intel i5-6600K e da quando uso computer, ovvero da quasi 20 anni, sono sempre rimasto fedele ad Intel, in quanto garanzia di maggior qualità e consideravo le CPU AMD, anche se buone in termini di prestazioni e prezzo, non all'altezza della concorrenza soprattutto per problemi incompatibilità software (dovuto spesso ai famigerati chipset VIA, spesso utlizzati nelle schede madri per CPU AMD). Però negli ultimi mesi vedendo l'esagerato rincaro dei prezzi delle CPU Intel, leggendo le buone recensioni e opinioni da parte di moltissimi utenti, nonché consultando diversi test prestazionali, ho avuto tutti gli elementi necessari per rivalutare questo produttore. Quindi ho deciso di acquistare un Ryzen 2700x. Non sono un videogiocatore e quindi il cosiddetto vantaggio che Intel ha sul singolo core rispetto AMD (soprattutto utile in ambito videogames, poiché raramente si vanno da usare oltre 4 cores) non m'interessa. I principali utilizzi che ne faccio computer sono la grafica 3D e la virtualizzazione: due ambiti dove meglio si sfruttano le CPUs con tanti cores.Quindi trovo questa CPU molto valida, un abbisso in confronto all'i5 che avevo poc'anzi (solo 4 cores e per giunta senza HT).",5,1,2018-12-31,0,1,0

We used this as part of a build to make a separate streaming Pc. We were streaming using a 6700k with a small overclock. We were generally streaming on faster or faster presets. With this CPU we were able to move down to slow preset in games and we intend to test even lower for creative/IRL streams. The quality difference is huge. Stream looks better at 720p than it used to at 1080p. We had the headroom to go back to 1080p but not get to a higher quality preset for gaming so we went with a resolution bump to use up CPU headspace.The cooler is perfectly adaquete for long streams and quiet enough to not show up on our audio. Only downside is amazon no longer price matches themselves. We bought an open box and a few days later it was on sale brand new for a significant amount less. We returned it by had to pay return shipping.,5,1,2018-12-6,0,9,0

AMD unlike Intel has provided an amazing and super easy upgrade path to AM4 platform users. I had bought Ryzen 3 1200 in Dec 2017 and used it until May 2020. Now my workloads (not only gaming) have surpassed what 4 core/4 thread CPU can handle and I was heavily bottlenecked by my CPU. I know that Zen2 CPUs are out already but the prices of 3700X and above are just not worth it. The temptation of 8 cores/16 threads is irresistible so I went with R7-2700X instead of the cheaper R5-3600. I have a MSI A320M Pro-VH Plus motherboard and I've checked my VRM components are same as that of a few B350/B450 by MSI like tomahawk and bazooka etc. I won't be OC'ing this CPU so here I am in 2020 buying this and keeping this VFM CPU until AM5 is out maybe even longer (preferred until at least 4 years).,4,1,2020-5-24,0,7,1

Der Kühlerkern besteht aus Kupfer und der Lüfter hat eine RGB-LED verbaut, die man über das Mainboard ansteuern kann, siehe Bilder. Ist eine nette Spielerei.

"What a processor !!! Just loved it. It's been 6 months, I made my home PC with AMD Ryzen 7 2700X purchased through Amazon. I feel like I am using a server, not a home PC. I LOVE it's Power. I run 3 - 4 VM windows machine on top of it, do lots of R&D, make flowless graphics editing. Loved it's overclocking. But ofcourse not only the processor, I am using all other great components like M.2 NVRAM SSD, C15 memory etc... I am not a gamer, so can't talk about that segment, but ofcourse CPU fan light is very attractive though it does not make any difference to me but my family and kids loved that.  Initially I was worried about its power consumptuon, but I found it does not take much power with low processing load, once we increase the load, it takes more wattage. CPU fan is very quite during low processing, as I increase the processing load, Fan moves faster hence create some noice, but thats accaptable, atleast much lower noice than a server. Base Win10 takes around 60 watt, as I power on each VM, 10 - 12 watt increases. Base Win 10 with some graphics processing takes around 75 to 80 watt. During Extreme processing, it takes 100 watt or more",5,1,2020-7-18,0,3,0

"This ryzen 2700x processor works very well for heavy multi-threading (compiling code, loading levels in RCPS3 emu).  I have thorough experience with overclocking CPUs & memory on AM4 platform using an x370 taichi from AsRock.  The compatibility with ALL CURRENT AM4 motherboards, low power requirement, and EASY AUTO OVERCLOCKING means that AMD has truly brought to the enthusiast a CPU you can drop in, and start gaming and compiling with!  After toying with manual overclocking, I honestly felt too annoyed with trying to eek out the best clocks with the lowest voltage...  DRAM overclocking, however, is much more finicky and time-intensive on AMD than Intel's offerings at this time.  Did I mention the much better pricing than Intel's?  Upon release of the 2700x, 8700k processors ran over $550 CDN!  Despite the closer cost differences, the 2700x provides amazing value, only to be topped by AMD's ryzen 5 2600/x.

"I upgraded from a 8350 fx which i used for years. Previously i was running  a phenom II black edition 3.2mhz. Honestly, between those two the fx did not feel like much of an upgrade, other than the increased core count which wasn't really that real it served it's purpose for the time i used it. However, the performance in gaming was god awful.  I paired up the 2700x with a taichi ASrock x470 board and wonders were happening. Just changing the cpu and ram/mobo keeping my old 390x i gained over 150fps in bf1 with the same settings. I paired it with my noctua cooler from my old am3 socket (with the upgrade bracket that comes for free). The cpu under load hovers between 60-70 degrees clocked up to 4.3ghz, it's amazing and i do have overclock headroom which is not bad.Overall, i highly suggest this cpu, the 8700k is an amazing cpu too but the increased core count on this one blows it away at nearly the same price.",5,1,2018-10-11,0,2,0

Sistema operativo che si carica praticamente all'istante dell'accensione (merito anche dell'ssd nvme), svariate operazioni in multitasking che non si rallentano fra di loro, archivi che si comprimono e decomprimono in tempo reale come una normale operazione di copia/incolla, 16 thread disponibili che vedo molto difficile riuscire a saturare con un singolo software anche molto complesso. Che dire ... un mostro di potenza ora a un prezzo abbordabilissimo. Ok, ha frequenze più basse, processo produttivo più vecchio, pci express 3.0 e non 4.0 e Ipc leggermente inferiore del 3700X, ma alla fine chi se ne frega, è costato persino meno del mio vecchio 2500K al momento dell'acquisto (2012). Vale in pieno tutti i soldi che lo pagate.

Nicht umsonst hat AMD nachgearbeietet und die 3000er Reihe sehr schnell nach der 2000er released.Dennoch für meinen Zweck echt super, wenn man überlegt, was ein gleichwertiger Intel kostet.

I tried many things to fix this such as updating the bios on his motherboard (shouldn’t have had to, brand new mother board that was Ryzen compatible). A temporary fix I tried was underclocking the CPU ( it fixed most of the issues but I wanted a better solution). So the fix (at least so far) was to increase the voltage to the CPU. But other than the extra hassle of the stutters this is a great CPU for the price. And after the fix it made my friends system run really really well.

Il Wraith Prism è efficace e non troppo rumoroso, la cpu non supera i 75°C durante le operazioni più pesanti. L'aspetto che NON MI E' PIACIUTO riguarda il sistema di montaggio del dissipatore tramite linguette, secondo me è di una scomodità assurda. Prezzo medio del periodo circa 190 euro, niente male. Nella mia configurazione utilizzo una B450 Fatal1ty Gaming K4, sicuramente per sfruttarlo a fondo sarebbe meglio utilizzare una mobo X470 ed un sistema di raffreddamento più performante: visto che per il momento le frequenze stock mi vanno più che bene, acquisterò solo un nuovo dissipatore per ottenere una maggiore silenziosità.",5,1,2020-5-21,0,0,0

"Por el precio y el rendimiento lo recomiendo. Este procesador de 8 núcleos es más que suficiente para los juegos actuales y su potencia lo hace compatible con la mayoría de las tarjetas de video ya que no causa el cuello de botella. El disipador que incluye (wraith prism) es más que suficiente para correrlo a stock o con un overclock ligero, pero si piensan hacerle a este procesador un overclock mayor es recomendable comprar un enfriador mas potente. Volviendo al enfriador como dije es suficiente para correrlo a stock y la inclusión de luces rgb y la forma son estéticamente agradables, las luces del enfriador pueden ser controladas mediante la tarjeta madre (si esta tiene pines dedicados a controlar luces rgb) o mediante una aplicación que se puede bajar (si se conecta a un panel usb de la tarjeta madre), tanto el logo como el aro y las aspas prenden y pueden ser configuradas de manera independiente (por lo menos desde la aplicación). Algo a tomar en cuenta es que el voltaje de este procesador viene configurado a 1.4, algo alto, lo que hace que las temperaturas sean más altas y el ruido del enfriador sea igual  incluso cuando no hay tareas realizándose, pero reduciendo el voltaje soluciona estos ""problemas"".

Wie kann es sein, das ein paar Sekunden nach dem Systemstart ohne auch nur 1 Mausklick zu machen es ganz schnell zwischen 37 und 43 °C trotz eingestelltem ""Eco Modus"" pendelt. Für eine CPU Temperatur ist das nicht viel, zeigt aber, wenn hohe Rechenleistung gefordert ist, das der Kühler absolut unzureichend ist. Ist schade, das er ausgetauscht werden muss, weil die Optik wirklich gut gelungen ist. AMD hätte die Fläche der Kühlbleche ca. 10 % größer machen müssen (nicht der Kupferplatte).

"The product is powered by 8 actual physical cores with SMT(simultaneous multi-threading) and 16 threads. Now compare that to the only 8 core 16 thread Intel processsor and you'll start seeing the value proposition here. Though single threaded applications take little bit of a hit, Intel doesn't win by much in that department. Multithreaded applications breeze through with this processor. You can see all the existing reviews about both these processors of different channels on youtube like Linus' or Hardware Canucks, among many others. The only reason I would give this product an overall 4 stars is because it fails to overclock beyond 4.0 GHz with the stock cooler. In a 15 mins Aida64 stress test my unit maintained a constant speed of 3.66 GHz after getting thermal throttled. Now since I dont do much of hardcore professional content creating, it doesn't really matter to me.

AMD will play any game you throw at it as will Intel but, it just smashes Intel in hyper threading. Now I know people are going to say hyper threading doesn't matter as much, but it sure doesn't hurt to have it if you need it.

En rendimiento habitual, mi computadora se mantiente siempre entre 58 a los 63 grados y solo cuando hago render llega a subir hasta los 85.

I've barely seen this run more than 18% usage. If you're looking to game AAA games in 2020, honestly I'd still recommend this. Now if you have a little more money to spend I'd definitely still go for Ryzen 3rd gen CPU's. But this puppy will still conquer and shread through CPU based apps.

The cooler is subpar because the horizontal sheets of copper the heat sink is made of are uneven?? leaving a black mark where there is an obvious hot spot on the cooler. Now, my point is when you can nowadays buy a cooler with a perfectly flush and polished copper base plate I ask WHY WHY WHY!!! I purchased an aftermarket cooler out of pocket bad deal. This is my second cooler from AMD the first had a flush surface and thermal paste pre-applied covering what I found out later was a copper burr obviously causing a gap between the CPU and the cooler.

Grabbed for 200 cad. Similar performance in single core performance to my previous 6700k i run a lot of vms so doubling the threads is very useful. I was easily able to get 4.3ghz at 1.35v on stock fan weirdly enough. That is way too loud the cpu fan is reporting 3000rpm. Suggest getting a 240-360mm AIO. Even without a overclock you aren't losing gaming performance as the inbuilt turbo boost is fantastic. Quick clarification pair with a b450 board x570 and x470 also work but are more expensive. A 320 board might work check with the manufacturer power draw might be a problem will definitely need a bios update do research some boards require you to have another first gen ryzen processor.

Ryzenの流れがきてんなーっと思っていたら私のパソコンのオワコン化が深刻化していたため、せっかくならRyzenパソコン組むかーということで購入。私の使用用途の大半がゲームなのですが、どのゲームで稼働させてもCPU使用率はせいぜい30%くらい。ベンチマーク以外で50%以上働いているところをまだ見たことがありません。こりゃocいらねえや！！！っということで同梱品のクーラーを使っているけど、アイドリングで40度くらい、ベンチマークの時に70〜75度、普通にゲームしているくらいなら60度くらいで安定しているので、定格ならクーラー買い替える必要ないかな！何よりかっこいい。性能の細かいところに関しては自分より詳しい人がいっぱい書いてくれてるので割愛。,5,1,2019-1-10,0,1,1

"Oh my dear, from where can I start? I really can't finish speaking of how much I like the piece of good. For me, this was the most £250+ worth spending that I've ever spend and I would do it again if it's necessary. I'd give this processor the best processor that ever created award and let me tell you why. First of all, you'll get an ""ACTUAL"" 8-cores CPU 16 threads and high-end features within in it. The processor will finish anything no matter what you're working on or on which program you're using. Moreover, the processor is on different level when comparing to other processor as you're getting actual high-end CPU in reasonable price. Never to mention that there is a stock cooler that came along, which is actually very very good that I never thought of getting after-market CPU cooler. Me as an architect, I did get the full potential performance of it from rendering architectural designs in programs, such as 3ds Max, Revit, Corona renderer. By getting it you won't think about upgrading your rig in at least the next 5 years. The one thing that I didn't like though, the quality of the pre-applied thermal paste that came with the stock cooler, this is where 1 star has taken away. The reason is that when you mount the cooler and try to remove it again the paste will stick on the CPU and will require actual effort to pull it off, the problem is by doing this the cooler will pull the CPU from the motherboard socket in unsafe way that might cause damage for your CPU. Also, the thermal paste that's been left on your processor after removing the cooler is hard to remove and it might end in leaking on the CPU socket in somehow while cleaning the paste, just exactly what happened with me. In a nutshell, I'm totally satisfied with it and never never regretting while waiting for AMD to completely crush Intel, because AMD seems to be promising.",4,1,2018-6-3,0,4,0

シングルでは同等、コア数の差で圧勝です。主にPUBGなどのゲームをしていますが、カクツキやひっかかりが少なくなりました。8700Kも使っていますが、比較するとクロック差でFPSは負けていますが、ながら作業をしながらのゲームも快適にこなせます。,5,1,2018-7-27,0,1,0

2019.12.14日に到着しました。箱を見たところ、正規代理店のシールがありませんでした。この商品は、正規輸入品ではなく、非正規ルートの輸入品と思います。同日、パソコンの自作に使いました。BIOSではRYZEN 7 2700Xと認識し、Windows10上でもRYZEN 7 2700Xと表示されました。速度も正規品と同じ程度出ますので、製品自体は「RYZEN 7 2700X」であり、偽物ではないようです。,3,1,2019-12-14,0,3,0

"I used the AMD 2700x for a Mini ITX build on in and Thermaltake Core V1 ITX Chasis.

I use this machine for my YouTube production. For my needs I find it’s a powerful little machine. For a 14 minute 30 FPS 1080p video with simple edits, transitions, sound processing, the delivery in Davinci Resolve 15 is done in around 4 minutes, or about 3x faster than my MX150 laptop with i7-8550u processor. Temperatures are well under control with the MoBo temp around 40°C, max CPU temp at 75°C, and max GPU temp at 72°C during the transcoding. The noise levels are a bit on the higher side due to the size of the Chasis, but subjectively lower than my laptop.

"Il Ryzen 7 2700X è un processore mostruoso. Il nuovo sistema di boost dinamico (Precision Boost 2) gli dà un notevole vantaggio rispetto alla prima serie, visto che ora può agire su tutti i core in maniera indipendente e più graduale a seconda delle necessità (e della capacità del dissipatore di mantenere basse le temperature).Il dissipatore incluso, poi, è davvero notevole! E' enorme ma bellissimo esteticamente. Ha già dei giochi di colore molto belli di default, ma si può connettere a una scheda madre compatibile con Aura Sync per sincronizzare i colori con quelli dello schema che scegliamo. Ma la cosa più importante è che fa un lavoro davvero egregio nel tenere il processore al fresco, cosa importantissima per il precision boost di cui parlavo prima. Nel mio case, che è piuttosto fresco e ha un buon ricambio d'aria, è riuscito anche a raggiungere i 4,1 GHz mantenendo 51° C quasi costanti.

"Resulta que en vez de el Ryzen 7 que pedí, en la caja venía un Athlon 64 X2. Además, en lugar del disipador había dos más pequeños y antiguos, llenos de suciedad. Me ha dado por mirar los comentarios del producto y resulta que a otras dos personas les ha sucedido lo mismo. Es vergonzoso que esto pase con una empresa como Amazon, que vende productos como si fueran nuevos, y ya no solo eso, sino que encima no controla las devoluciones. Estoy seguro de que otra persona ha sido la culpable, pero por la falta de seriedad de Amazon, nosotros, el usuario final, salimos perjudicados.

"Mega! Der Prozessor ist meiner Meinung nach der beste Prozessor im Endergebnis welchen man haben kann. Mit 8x4,3 GHz ein mega Gaming Erlebnis. Bis auf diese eine Sache... KAUFT EUCH EINEN ANDREN KÜHLER. Durch den Box Kühler von AMD ist der Prozessor durch das übertakten immer zu heiß geworden. Hier besteht die Gefahr des Hitzetodes. Wer ihn nicht übertakten will kann den Box Kühler nutzen, wer auf Nummer sicher gehen will zahlt 50€ extra.AMD ist zurück! Mit einem Überflieger!",5,1,2018-6-13,0,2,0
"La primera ves que lo pedi llego mal, pero amazon me lo cambio y hasta me salio mas barato que como lo habia pedido inicialmente, me dio gusto que no pusiseran peros y me lo cambiaran, ahora confio mas en Amazon, respecto al procesador tenia un fx 8320 asi que es muy notable la diferencia. Me enanta este procesador no solo por el discipador rgb sino por su desempeño puedo jugar juegos demandantes y ni se despeina",5,1,2018-6-29,0,0,0
機械学習の並列処理をCPUのみの処理で2時間ほどさせましたが、78°Cが最高温度のままでした。通常時でも40°Cにいかない程度の温度です。ネットサーフィンなど普通の作業では4コア程度しか使用されないため、CPUパワーには余力が残り安心ができます。,5,1,2018-9-18,0,1,0
"Prima dell'acquisto di questo processore, avevo sentito ottime recensioni riguardo a questo Ryzen. Volendo puntare su potenza di calcolo in gaming, ma soprattutto in rendering, ho optato per questo processore. Se devo essere sincero non mi aspettavo prestazioni così alte. Premetto che utilizzo il processore con la sua ventora stock, il Wraith Prism. Con un programma di ritocco aperto, una chiamata su Discord, dove condividevo il mio schermo con un amico, dove stavo giocando ad un gioco pesante, il processore non ha avuto nessun affatticamento, tanto da rimanere tra i 70 e 75 gradi. Forse mi sembrerà strano un risultato così, perchè prima avevo un i7 3770, però a pensarci il salto prestazionale è giustificabile.Lo consiglio a chi vuole un processore per rendering e gaming, dove non ha molte pretese in fps e risoluzione. (ho uno schermo in hd e tengo i 60 fps fissi ad alto/ultra, nonostante abbia una gtx 960 2GB)",5,1,2018-5-25,0,7,1

"El procesador lo he instaldo en una placa X370 pro carbon con la ultima bios compatible para que funcione, en los test que he realizado por el momento obtengo los siguientes datos y conclusiones:Hay que actualizar los programas para recoger datos los mas exactos posibles y aun asi varian bastante, algunos ofrecen datos erroneos. El administrador de tareas de windows muestra una velocidad base de 3.7ghz y actual entre (3.4 y 3.7) estresandolo en plena carga aun habiendo configurado el multiplicador fijo a (4.2ghz) sigue mostranndo datos erroneos, el boost lo he deshabilitado.",4,1,2018-4-25,0,3,0
"Cambie mi ryzen 7 1700 stok enfriado por agua por este 2700x.. cual fue mi impresion ... en render de video solo fue 3 min mas rapido...  se nota un poco mas fluido a la hora de reprocucir el video desde premiere.. en todo lo demas navegador etc siento lo mismo que con el anterior.. en juegos la verdad tampoco note diferencia aun que seguro si la hay .. lo que si note al instante fue la temperatura .. ryzen 7 1700 reposo en 25c vs 2700x 35 a 45c ""casi todo el tiempo esta a 3.95ghz"" en renders la temperatura del 1700 era maximo 44c.. con el 2700x llega a 65c.. el enfriamiento es un h115i con un gabinete con muy buena entrada de aire... conclusion ! si tienes como yo un ryzen 1700 no vale tanto la pena lo que ganas de rendimiento lo pagas en temperatura... solo hazle oc al 1700 a 3.7ghz y tendrias el mismo rendimiento ... yo no lo hice porque prefiero un equipo super estable y frio... el  2700x me salio en 3400 pesos por eso me anime al cambio",5,1,2020-2-7,0,0,0

Ryzen2700Xに換装して正解でした。主に動画編集をメインにパソコンをしているので必要十分です、マルチスレッド性能では、i７ 6900Kを上回ります。シングル性能ではi7にまだまだ劣りますがAMD側の対抗意識十分です。,5,1,2018-6-17,0,2,0

Posso dire che esiste anche AMD lo sfruttamento di Intel e già finito! L'agente può scegliere tra uno e l'altro.Dunque arriviamo al nostro processore AMD Ryzen 7 2700x molto contento. Fa bene il suo dovere si comporta bene anche nei giochi che a pieno carico. Le temperature sono contenute accoppiato con un Noctua NH-U12A e una scheda madre Asus Crosshair vii Hero x470. Bel lavoro AMD un piccolo aggiornamento devo dire chi non ha la possibilità di cambiare il suo dissipatore stock farà molta fatica ad avere il processore fresco e temperature ragionevole perché questo processore scalda abbastanza. E se non fosse la Noctua NH-U12A era un bel problema. Preso con 171€,5,1,2020-1-26,0,6,0
