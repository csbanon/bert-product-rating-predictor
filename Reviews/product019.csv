"Sound quality is so subjective I want to review other aspects of the speaker and in comparison with comparably priced Anker Sound Boost. The reason is I was leaning toward the JBL Flip 4 but was researching Amazon to see if there were better options.  There were a number of reviews for Anker that rated it superior to Flip 4, some from people professing to be experts or audiophiles. I took a chance and originally purchased the Anker, returned the next day and bought the Flip 4.  I don;t profess to be either an expert or audiophile but I've bought many Wireless Speakers ranging from cheap to Beats and Bose.  When I opened the Anker I was disappointed. The USB charging cable was obviously flimsy and cheap and the documentation even cheaper appearing. I had charge issues right off the bat and tried to contact support. In the interim I learned from web research that charging issues are not uncommon and that the manufacturer recommends using a different (higher quality) charging cable as the first remedy. I also learned that the instruction manual is incorrect and that the manufacturer is familiar with both problems yet continue to ship the speakers with these two inadequate components!  I did connect the Anker to a couple of my devices and the Bluetooth connection was quick and easy. Both the range and sound quality were less than I expected. And, when I connected to my High Resolution Sony Digital player the volume control of the player was disabled.  I researched that problem and found that it is a known issue when the Sony is connected to some lower quality Bluetooth devices.The JBL Flip 4 arrived professionally packaged (as expected) with a robust USB charging cable and separately packaged, professionally printed and ACCURATE instructions.  Initial charge was quick and as documented. Bluetooth connection is also quick and easy.  Range is probably at least as good as advertised and way better than the Anker. All controls of my connected devices (i.e. Sony player volume, etc.) work perfectly. Sound quality is subjective but that along with volume, bass, etc. it certainly meets my expectations and certainly is superior to Anker Sound Boost.  JBL and Harman Kardon are brands that music lovers know they can trust and they continue to deliver.  This is probably the best Bluetooth Speaker you can buy for under $100.  I only share this in case someone else is considering the Flip 4 and checking out the options.  Please don't get fooled by reviews of some competitors, especially those who use JBL Flip 4 in unfavorable comparison. Of course we all buy speakers for the sound not for the packaging or accessories or printed material but if those things are inferior it's pretty indicative of what to expect with the main product.",5,1,2018-5-7,1,3,0
"I bought this speaker August 4th of 2017. It sounded great when working, but a week ago it stopped taking a charge. I have tried all kinds of things, and tested all the possible USB chargers to make sure that it was not the chargers. The unit just does not charge at all, I have tried overnight charging, and 2 days worth or USB, and a different cable,  but no go. My next step is to see if JBL will honor some kind of warranty. Booo!",1,1,2017-10-19,1,6,0
"This is a bittersweet review: I purchased this speaker in June of 2017, and for 14 months, this has been an outstanding little speaker. Sound is crisp, rich and bold. It is indeed water resistant and has held up under many different conditions, including the Florida heat and inclement weather. I don't know if I used it a bit more than the average consumer (20 to 30 hours a week), but in the past 30 days, I've noticed the battery life diminishing exponentially. Today (after a full charge last night), the battery was completely drained after 2 hours of use. The only other complaint I had prior to this, is that the charging cable broke at about the 9 month mark. So in summation, it may be that I just used it to ""death"", however for the $90+ paid for the device, I am very disappointed to not experience much greater longevity.",3,1,2018-9-4,1,3,0
"I will be writing this view with a total and complete comparison to a $25 Anker speaker I previously purchased.  The JBL beats the Anker in the most important category.  It does sound better.  However, with a much steeper price tag, it better.The Anker is far superior in the other two categories.  I beat the hell out of my Anker and even got it soaked in water only for it to keep on ticking.  Supremely impressed.  The JBL already has a tear in the mesh speaker portion.  It has not been quite as road tested but I'm not very optimistic.",1,1,2018-10-20,1,3,0
I am so fascinated how extremely great this speaker is for only a whopping 100$ dollars. I would buy this speaker for 300$. An absolute steal!Pros:,5,1,2017-4-16,1,2,1
"It is very sad, my JBL Flip 4 just stopped working, it doesn't charge anymore. It has been less then a year since i used it. It has been handled with care. I'm not sure what to do now. The JBL it self worked really good, I really liked the sound. I really don't recommend it to anyone. My JBL Flip 4 is still under warranty but I can't get hold of anyone to see what action i need to take next. I googled it and apparently it is know problem by JBL at some point they just stop working....... Very sad for the price that it is. ....... Many people have similar issues with it. They say that to fix it you need to take it apart and reconnect or do something of that sorts. If you want to go through that go ahead a buy it!!! I regret spending so much money and not get use of it.",1,1,2018-8-4,1,2,0
"This speaker is absolutely amazing, and definitely worth the price! I have been using this speaker ever since I received it in the mail. I was so impressed with the quality, the sound, and the bass. I bought the white speaker, and the only thing I have to say about it is that the color looks like more of a pure white when it is in the light and might look like more of an off-white/grey in regular light. The speaker came with a wrist strap which is really awesome, and also a charger. The packaging is very nice, and I am going to use that as a place to put my JBL when I finish using it. It is very easy to pair with a device, and if you choose to download the JBL Connect+ app it is also easy to pair with as well. The battery life is spectacular, so you don't really have to worry about charging it often. Overall, great speaker! I would recommend this to anyone!",5,1,2018-8-8,1,2,1
"Ok, if you are reading the reviews, you know by now that the battery life is horrible. And here is another review about it.The sound is amazing. When you first start using it, you are really impressed by everything about the Flip 4. After 1 year using it, battery won't charge at all. I started using it connected to the power. And now, not even that will work. For a brand like JBL, it seems to me that they don't care about it. So many people with the same problem, and I couldn't find any answer from JBL.",1,1,2018-11-25,1,2,0
"This speaker died six months after purchase.  It was used a limited amount of time and was never exposed to water.  It just stopped working. The enclosed documentation is printed in hundreds of languages, but no where can I locate warranty information. A most unsatisfactory buying experience.",1,1,2018-6-23,1,2,0
"The only reason I am giving this product two stars instead of one star is because when it worked, it had excellent sound.  HOWEVER, after a year of minimal use, it will not accept a charge anymore.  It has not been dropped or abused in any way.  I would expect a speaker that cost $100 or so to last MUCH longer.  Very disappointed.  Will not be buying a JBL product again.",2,1,2018-6-2,1,2,0
"Nice, crisp, clean sound. I do not agree with some reviewers who complain that there's not enough bass. My complaint is that most headphones and speakers these days have too much. I listen mostly to jazz and classical, and I want a balanced sound with good mid-range and highs. I am frequently finding too much bass even with 'bass reducer' on.  Custom equalization in the speakers and headphones themselves are probably the only way to satisfy everyone.  I like the sound of this however.I dropped a star for this reason: there is no way to skip back a song and that is really annoying. Every other speaker/headphone/earbud I own has a way to skip backwards -- this is the first device without that ability and they need to fix that. I'm also not wild about all the loud, weird noises it makes going on and off -- like a spaceship taking off and landing. They should offer a way to disable that.",4,1,2018-5-31,1,6,0
"Great little speaker but unfortunately JBL is switching away from connect+ (which this and most others have from JBL) to ""Party boost"" for connecting more than one speaker around the house or yard at the same time. JBL is making ALL their speakers obsolete with pairing to newer speakers. The flip 5 is only the current model that has jumped to part boost so far. The software is not fwd or backwards compatible so either stick with the older models or buy the newest ones..which haven't all come out yet. Really a let down. Terrible decision to not make them all talk together.",4,1,2019-12-11,1,4,0
"Has GREAT sound production. And range is decent at about 100 feet. The issue with this unit is its performance. It doesn't have an adequate play time from a full charge. If you're looking for a quiet relaxing experience listening to your favorite classical music, at low tone, then it may impress you with stamina. But, for the rest of us who are looking to jam the set with some deep beat grooves of R & B, some ambient progressive House/Trance music, then 3/3.5 hours @ 0.75 volumes is the maximum time for snapping your fingers, nodding your head and swaying your hips.I have purchased other units in the past that have an even greater dynamic sound and performed for longer at higher levels of sound then this unit, go figure 🤔.",2,1,2018-8-19,1,6,1
"Battery: The battery life seems good. It lasts long enough to not pay attention to how long it lasts honestly.Sound: It is very good, very clear until 80% volume, then it gets a bit distorted. However, I never use it more than 60% volume anyways since it gets really loud. I think, if you need a product to play music in a very large and crowded party, just get a bigger speaker. For all the other use cases, this is just good enough. Another thing to mention is the bass is boosted, sometimes it fells like too much to me. But, I know some will love it this way.",5,1,2018-6-10,1,4,0
"I purchased two of these speakers in November 2017. It seemed a very promising product. It provides relatively decent sound, and can be connected to a number of devices. However, after just a little over a year of having purchased two of these and making moderate to light use of them, BOTH have stopped working: There seems to be some kind of battery flaw--the speakers will work for a few minutes, and then a crackling noise will begin, after which the speakers simply turn themselves off. I had extensive correspondence with customer service, and they are not only unable and/or unwilling to help, but seem unable and/or unwilling to even understand what the problem is. Most of the time, it feels like I am corresponding with a computer rather than a human being.I will have to purchase new speakers. They will most definitely NOT be JBL at this point, and I would caution anybody from buying these--certainly if you are interested in a speaker that will last for more than one year.",1,1,2019-8-7,1,5,0
I've had these for about 2 1/2 months....and all I can say is....Wow!! These are so much better than I expected!I bought 2 for stereo sound and they are astounding! I love them!!,5,1,2020-2-5,1,1,0
I purchased this speaker in April of 2019.  I upgraded from a 30 dollar blue tooth speaker my doss sound box which was 3 years old at the time wasn't holding a charge so i figured well maybe if i spend another 50 dollars i will get quality.  JBL.  Good name.  I've seen and heard their speakers before.  It is July of 2020 and the speaker is isn't holding a charge and dying often.  I am very vexed as I feel like i have not received my money's worth because I have a 30 dollar speaker which STILL WORKS 4 years later.  4 years later that one works that i paid 30 for. this one that i paid 80?  nope.  No dice.I used to be able to run it for 3-4 hours at a clip on full charge.  Now i don't even get that out of it i get maybe an hour if i am lucky and that isn't at full blast volume.,1,1,2020-7-1,1,1,0
"I've experienced the sound of a flip 3 and for the life of me, I can't figure out why the 4 would lack so much bass.  Not my biggest gripe. Bluetooth was terrible. I had to re-pair it with every device I used it on, every. single.time..  Bluetooth is awesome when it works but it is one of the most finicky wireless standards out there.  Sadly my experience sucked. Probably a bad chip.  Crappy bluetooth sealed the deal, though as I was already unhappy with the bass response.  I feel they may have cut some corners in the design.  Had to return, not interested in another.  I appreciate the other reviews offering some competing products.",1,1,2019-10-8,1,3,0
"I have owned this speaker, purchased on Amazon, for 2 years now, and as of last month, it will no longer hold a charge.  The battery life used to be excellent, I would rarely have to charge it with moderate use.  Now the speaker will only work if I keep it plugged in, very inconvenient, and even then, sometimes the speaker will start crackling and then randomly shut off.  If I turn it back on, it will work again.  I purchased this speaker over other brands as I have always had great luck with JBL and was a believer in their products so I paid the price premium for it.  Reading some other reviews, this seems to be a relatively common problem, which is completely unacceptable for something as simple as this.  I have other battery operated electronics that I have owned for 5, 10 years, etc that still work perfect.  NO EXCUSE FOR THIS JBL!!!  Others indicate they have called customer service to be told they are out of warranty and they won't help.  That is BS, especially given JBL should be aware that this speaker as a defect causing reduced life of the battery.  Let me also say this speaker has been babied by me.  It has never been in water, never even rained on.  It has ALWAYS been kept indoors in a climate controlled environment when not in use.  Very upset about this.  I will try contacting customer service and if they are willing to do anything, I will update my review.  As of now though, I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND this product.",1,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0
"I bought a flip4 in May 18, I bought another in Jun 18.  They have decent sound.  The first unit bought in May died in Jun 19, now the second new unit I purchased in Jun 18 is doing the same thing a month later.  It won't hold a charge sometimes and it when it does it takes about 5 hrs to recharge this is exactly like the first one did before it totally failed.Both flip4's have never been abused or even wet. I believe it is the circuit board that is cheap and defective but the battery is marginal in these things too.",1,1,2019-7-12,1,6,0
"I've got three of these. They can all be connected together to give a surround sound experience and they work best indoors, but actually carry well outdoors as well. A drawback to connecting the devices is range. Unfortunately, the range on these isn't really that great. So, for outdoor uses, it can be annoying when one speaker moves too far away and you have to reconnect manually if it's separated for too long. Indoors, you have to worry about walls and things that mess with signal strength. Even a single, hollow, basic door can interrupt the signal if you move more than 10 feet away from the signal transmitter.I particularly love the water resistance on these bad boys because I take mine kayaking all the time. I have, in fact, tested the submersibility of these and, although not recommended, they will not be harmed if only underwater for a few seconds. So, definitely don't worry if it starts raining, but it's still best to give them a little refuge from the constant barrage of water. Spalshing is fine, even mud is OK (again, not recommended...but it won;t break the thing) and you can wash it off if it gets dirty...Just don't go overboard- it's still a speaker.",4,1,2020-5-9,1,1,0
"I had a JBL Flip 2 and loved it, so I bought a JBL Flip 3 and also loved it! I also have friends who own the JBL Charge and the JBL Pulse, and I've always been impressed by those models as well. So, when the JBL Flip 4 came out, and I saw its price is so affordable, I went ahead and bought it because it never hurts to have a few (one in my office, one in the RV, one in the living room, etc).I bought the Ocean Blue color, which I was impressed with as soon as I opened it. The color is beautiful; dark, deep, and unassuming, but also different and unique. I really love the color. My first impression was that the Flip 4 felt heavier than my Flip 3, and I was excited to hear the quality of the sound, because I was sure JBL was continuing to innovate and improve their flagship bluetooth speaker...",3,1,2019-6-6,1,5,0
"I loved the sound on this speaker. Around 1 year, 3 months, it stopped charging. Bummer.Update 10/1/2019: I contacted JBL customer service and as this failure occurred at 1.25 years, I have exceeded the 1 year warranty and they will not do anything about it. They suggested I could take it to a repair shop and pay for those expenses, if I can find a shop that is qualified. I'm not sure the battery can actually be replaced. I effectively purchased an $86, disposable speaker. The speaker won't work if it is plugged in and the battery won't work. I purchased this because of the reputation JBL has for quality, but I am disappointed with the disposable nature of this product. It looks like there are other reviewers with the same issue.",1,1,2019-9-29,1,6,0
"I purchased mine Saturday night and had it in hand Monday morning, (I kind of cheated. I work for the USPS, so I was able to intercept mine before it went out for delivery) so huge props for rapid shipping. As I mentioned, I work for the USPS as a mail carrier, and I wanted a decent speaker to listen to music and audiobooks while delivering my route. Mail trucks are not at all quiet inside. Road noise is horrible and the bumps and bangs of the suspension are quite loud. The engines engines typically sound like someone dumped a box of ball bearings into an old blender. All in all, not a very listener-friendly environment. Regardless, this relatively small speaker (roughly the size of a 16-18 ounce soda can) powers through the ambient noise and is clear and loud. Very solid bass for such a small platform. I started my route of about 5.75 hours of road time, fully charged, and at the end of the day, it was at about 80% charge.I love this thing. It even fits in my drink holder in the truck.",5,1,2018-8-7,1,7,0
"I bought this speaker about a year and nine months ago after returning one of the same model because I thought it was defective. It had terrible Bluetooth connectivity; it was unable to keep a solid connection more than about 20 feet from the source.This one--the replacement--was a little better but still not impressive in that regard. Still, satisfied that it wasn't so much a defective product as a design issue, I decided to live with it. The sound was good, and the battery life seemed pretty good too. I was happy enough with this for a few months. Then the battery life started plummeting.",2,1,2019-5-25,1,5,0
"It doesn't charge anymore, it was good for a couple months after I bought it. I used to play music in my room when I was on my a cruise.  Then didn't use it again for a while till today (july 1st). It died and now it's not chargin at all, I know the charger and cord work because I charge my headphones from it. It's even the cord that came with the speaker. NOT happy with it",1,1,2018-6-30,1,1,0
"So when i first bought this speaker just over a year ago I was stoked about it! It was loud, had great battery life, and decent sound quality for the price. Now just over a year later, I cannot get the speaker to stay on for 5 mins playing music no matter how full the battery is. It plays for a few mins then starts crackling the bass/speakers really bad and then shuts off. Even if it when i leave it plugged in it only plays for 30mins or so before doing the same weird speaker crackling and shut off. I get that this wasn't super top of the line but i most deff thought I'd get more than a year out of the speaker! I'll be shopping elsewhere for my Bluetooth speaker needs....",1,1,2020-8-3,1,4,0
"These are great. I was using the JBL for quite some time and I never complained from them, until the unfortunate event where my nephew dropped them on the floor and the bass was busted. I went on to buy the FLIP 4  and the sound is noticeably better along with the quality and the great waterproof features ( which i don't really intend to risk using in the water, but it's good to know it's there)the only thing that bugged me is that the FLIP had a cover along with a charger, which was a cool feature. the FLIP 4 on the other hand, come with a charging cable only.",5,1,2017-8-21,1,7,0
"I bought this Flip 4 to replace an aging Aomais Sport II that was now giving me 2 hours of playtime and the last hour was fuzzy noise.The size of the JBL Flip 4 threw me it’s tiny fits in my hand. The sound threw me next. It’s a very nice sounding product for what you get. My yard is pretty big, with a running waterfall at the poolside. I wanted a device that could fill pool area with music. The JBL Flip 4 handles that. Better than my last two devices.",4,1,2018-9-26,1,5,1
"Let me first say, this is my second JBL flip 4, the one I had prior to this was an absolute BRUTE. I’m talking tough! It had been submerged under water, dropped countless times, taken to the beach, withstanded super hot summer days for hours, getting caked with mud but alas, it got ran over by a car while off-roading one day... but guess what? It STILL WORKS. Even in its smashed up state nothing broke but the speaker cover protector. So bravo JBL, this is a great product. However I bought this one for my father for his birthday, he only used it a few times in his bedroom and now it won’t turn on at all, so I tinkered with it come to find out it was a remanufactured speaker put back together incorrect without water proof rubber gaskets for the speakers, keep in mind I payed full price for a NEW speaker! Now the return windows are closed and I’m unsure who to contact to hopefully make this right...",1,1,2018-8-27,1,1,0
"Update: I can now say without a doubt that the sound quality on the flip4 is superior to the UE Boom speakers. I was at my sisters house and she had the UE Boom going and all I could think is 'Where is the base?' On the flip 4 the base is rich and strong. I am so glad I have the flip 4 now. I almost bought the other.This is the second JBL flip 4 I have owned. The first one was great but the battery would no longer hold a charge after only 1.5 years of what I thought was mild usage. I broke it because I tried to replace the battery. These speakers are not built to have a battery replacement. ANYWAY , I bought it again because after suffering over the last 2 months with an Anker bt speaker that cost about 30 bucks I wanted my flip 4 back. I missed the beautiful base and over all sound quality. The speaker arrived in the mail today and I'm in heaven. All my favourite songs on pandora have come back to life because of it! The short overall battery life sucks but the sound on this speaker is what makes this second purchase the right choice. My sister has these huge UE bt speakers and I swear i like the flip 4 more than i like them. I think the base is more impressive but then, that's me.  By the way these are made  by Harmon Kardon.

Really good sound - surprising bass coming from this little speaker.Edit:,1,1,2017-7-15,1,4,0
"Bought 2 of these, one white and one red so that we could take advantage of stereo and party modes.  In party mode they both play the same exact audio and in stereo one is left and one right ( obviously )  I do recommend getting 2 different colors, when you open the app it actually identifies the speaker and its color so setting left or right for stereo is super simple since you can see each speaker pictured with its color.  Reason I chose these JBLs is based on some reviews I have read and watched on youtube.  They are not the loudest out there but plenty loud and for me the selling point was that even at max volume the sound was crisp and didn't distort.  They are water and dust proof, I have dropped one under water already and it still works great.  We take these along when we go paddle boarding and clip them to our boards without any worries of them getting wet.  While paddling I operate my phone all via voice which works really well with this speaker.  So as far as sound goes they are great, range is great, really are waterproof and plenty loud for a party.  Reason I took away 1 star is that there is no way to go to previous track, not that I have discovered anyway, please msg me if I am wrong and I'll up the rating. The play button acts as play/pause/and with double tap next track..  Why not add a triple tap for previous? Or maybe use the Bluetooth connect button double tap for previous?  Since the speakers get software updates maybe this is something that will get implemented.  If you are wondering if the stereo and party modes and if its worth getting these for that alone I would say yes.  We used them on a houseboat in both party and stereo mode and the sound filled the entire upper deck of the 80 ft boat with no problem.",4,1,2017-10-28,1,3,0
"I am not rich and $80 is a pretty big investment for me to make in a speaker. I reviewed, reviewed and reviewed all these speakers for two weeks before being convinced this was ""the best.""

It just turns itself off.Do you know how annoying it is to be listening to music and have to go up to the speaker every 10 or so minutes and turn it back on? I mean, come on, that's ridiculous, no?

"Although I'm not doing speaker reviews anymore I was so impressed by the JBL Flip 4 that I had to write a little something. The Xiaomi Mi has been my go-to BT speaker. It has really great sound; especially for the size. Sadly I accidentally played some frequency test tones at high volume and my Xiaomi Mi was blown. After 3 days of only having laptop speakers I was fed up. I needed something better. Good things have been written about the JBL Flip 3, and I always wanted to give it a try. Now the 4 is out and I hear it's even better! Being desperate for quality sound I bought one.I really wasn't planning on buying any speakers and really couldn't afford it. I'm experienced and very picky about audio. From all I've read my expectations were very high. Given all of this the odds were stacked high against the Flip 4.",5,1,2017-4-11,1,7,0
I actually have an oontz speaker which I liked but they are all defective after a few months where the charging ports stop working. I got a replacement which also broke so I tried this speaker. First I really don’t like that you can’t see the battery percent on this JBL speaker. There’s a area that has 4 lights that lights up when you turn the speaker on. This shows you the battery percent but only when you turn the speaker on. So if you’re playing the speaker for hours you won’t know the battery percent unless you turn speaker off then on. On the oontz you can look on your iPhone and see battery percentage and it also has the little earphone on the top of phone showing that it’s connected to your speaker. On the jbl nothing will show on your phone that you’re connected to the speaker. Also I like use the Bluetooth to listen to a audio book as I go to sleep. I like the volume low on my speaker while having the volume for iPhone alarm loud so I can wake up on time. With the jbl speaker the volume for everything on your phone is connected to the speaker. So if you have the speaker volume low that means your phone alarm and ringer is the same volume. I’ve gone into my iPhone to see if there was something that could be done but my settings on sound: change volume with buttons was off. Meaning that anything connected should not affect my phone volume settings. So this speaker is really not user friendly. I’m returning this and trying a more expensive oontz with a 2 year protection plan. Fingers crossed.,1,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
"I decided to order the Certified Refurbished for 69.00 from RARTV.  I've always ordered refurbished electronics and had good luck.  This item is absolutely perfect.  Don't let the ""plain box"" thing stray you.  It's still very clearly custom made to fit the speaker perfectly,  it has cardboard holders on each end keeping the speaker suspended in the middle.  And a JBL sticker that fit's over the top of the box, not just a sticker pasted on, it's tailored to the box.  So you if don't care about the blah blah on-boxing and packaging, you get what you need.  The speaker doesn't have a mark on it and I wouldn't believe that it's not new, just repackaged due to a return our something.  That being said, I'm a child of the 80's where we had 5' tall speakers and massive amps.  I'm constantly amazed at how far things have come.  For it's size I'm astonished how well it sounds.  If you stick it in the corner of you counter top while cooking you'll get much more bass giving it corners to bounce off.  In a complete open area, the bass is surprisingly strong, but I would say it's highlights would be vocals, and clarity of all the stuff above the deep bass.  I can say this is for, the money, this is the most satisfying electronic's purchase I've made for a long time.  As soon as I heard it I immediately started thinking of more and more places I could bring good sounding music with me.  A definite thumbs up to JBL and RARTV for giving this quality for the money.",5,1,2019-1-11,1,1,0
"Used this speaker for about 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. Bought it for use at work. After first use (a little over 3 hrs) I saw that the red LED was blinking. Low battery. I thought it was odd since they advertise a 12 hour battery life. But figured, maybe I didn't charge it all the way. Decided to do some tests.Recharged it (5 steady white LEDs that then turn off when complete). Tests were using Bluetooth connection within 10 feet.",2,1,2019-12-15,1,1,0

"Great sound.  Great appearance. Great packaging.  HOWEVER, the battery couldn't be any worse.  Co-workers own the Flip2 and Flip3, and all of is have experienced the same. After only a few uses the battery no longer holds a charge and ois nearly impossible to get a full charge.  If JBL can't get this issue fixed and stand behind their product,  I think you should look elsewhere for a speaker.",1,1,2017-8-31,1,1,0

"This is slightly bigger than the Flip 3 (which I just returned due to a loose screw or something inside). I decided to upgrade for about $7 to the Flip 4. Love the sound of the Flip 4 (and Flip 3), the battery is a bit better than the Flip 3 and I am glad it is fully waterproof where the Flip 3 was splash proof.Solved Added a Star - Latest Firmware Update resolved the noisy on and off sounds that we have been complaining about for more than a few years. Worth mentioning is that if you play this bad boy at a high vol. level the battery power does drop accordingly. As much as 60% (to ~4 hrs) at Hi Vol. You can play it plugged in tho so a portable bat. or outlet helps.",5,1,2019-2-5,1,1,0
"I've been wanting a portable speaker for a while now and finally broke down to get one before our vacation this year. After a decent amount of research, this one kept coming up in the top 3 or top 5 portable speakers on the market. And I liked it best because of it's price point.I tried it out while watching movies and listening to music, and it does a great job at both. I have not yet tried out the speakerphone or the JBL Connect app, but I didn't get it for a speakerphone and I'm not planning on getting another one so no need for the app to link others for ""party mode"".",5,1,2017-9-11,1,2,0
"I initially tried to save some money and bought an Oontz (forget which model, it was about half the price, though, so this might not be comparing apples to apples) triangle-shaped speaker. It arrived, and honestly it sounded so horrible I assumed it must be defective and returned it.  I'm not really a sound snob, but that speaker sounded awful. Everything was distorted and mushy, even at medium volumes.So, after reading that basically everybody thought the JBL speakers sounded better, I decided to order this one. So far, I'm super happy.  What sounded distorted and mushy on the Oontz sounds clear and warm on the JBL, even at louder volumes. The JBL does sound the tiniest bit tinny or hollow, but that is just me being critical, it doesn't bother me at all.  Honestly I was surprised at how good the speaker sounded.",5,1,2019-4-30,1,0,0
"Great speaker for both indoor and outdoor use. I use it as a speaker for my projector, for music streaming in the apartment, for beach entertainment, and backyard bbqs.I would give it 5 stars, but Ive had some issues with the usb charging port on the speaker. The last speaker I had, the charging port malfunctioned. No bends, not breaks, just stopped charging. Apparently other people had some issues with this as well. Ive learned to be much more careful when plugging in, but is still something I worry about.",4,1,2018-2-8,1,3,0
"PROSBIG SOUND: This little gizmo gives clean, clear sound across the entire frequency range, including plenty of bass. If you need volume, it will give you quite a bit, and if you run several together (see the JBL web site for specs and capabilities), you could greatly increase the coverage area. Several of these might make an excellent compact wireless speaker system, as long as you start with fully charged batteries and remember the power limitations of each unit - 16 watts (8 X 2) maximum.",5,1,2019-10-23,1,0,0
"My Flip 3's battery decided to visit Valhalla recently, and after a botched attempt at repairing that old workhorse failed (I accidentally sliced through the ribbon cable, oopsie!) I had to look for a replacement unit.  After a lot of searching, reading both professional and amateur reviews of the seemingly hundreds of Bluetooth speakers out there, I decided it'd be best to just get the Flip 4.  So far, I have not been disappointed with my purchase.Compared to the previous model, it seems the sound quality has been slightly improved on this version.  It's notably brighter than before, and the bass is ever so slightly less lumpy sounding.  It still won't fill a room up with thunderous boomy bass, but none of the speakers in this size category will.  Like the previous version, this thing feels like it's built like a tank, and may survive a drop or five on a hard surface without totally breaking.  All the buttons have a nice, tactile feel to them so you can easily adjust the volume or hit the play-pause-skip button without looking.  The buttons for power and linking two devices together are more recessed now, and a bit harder to hit, but this makes it easier to carry around without accidentally turning it off mid-song.",4,1,2018-12-7,1,1,0
It feels like it's built well and it looks great...and then I turned it on and heard the God-awful hissing. Even with no sound playing and no devices connected the hissing echo'd through my office.  Got a replacement and this one hisses when any sound is playing. Tested via AUX cable and bluetooth. Even the power up and power off sounds produce the hissing noise with no devices or charging cable connected. Sending the replacement back for a refund and moving on.,1,1,2019-10-10,1,3,0
"I work in a factory... It is noisy... I have tried many different music making time killer solutions over the years (yes years)... My music requirements have changed because I no longer want to share my music with my surrounding coworkers... Now a lot of them use earbud headphones and don't enjoy my old time rock and roll... My last successful attempt was the JBL Xtream speakers, very nice a bit too loud and a bit too heavy to carry in my work backpack... I tried to use my old Jawbone original and it was no way cutting it, but the size was perfect... So I thought maybe somebody has made something similar size and more powerful... I already liked JBL, so the JBL Flip 4 was something that may work... After all these years I think maybe I have found the perfect speaker... It really is very loud for its size...",5,1,2018-8-18,1,2,0
I already owned one for the last year - and I love it. I wanted to put one in the larger rooms to create a fuller sound throughout the house- so I bought during cyber Monday.  Battery life isn't and issue but keeping an eye out for it is my problem.  I usually go to use and THEN discover the lack of charge.I lowered the rating of bluetooth connect as I have had difficulty that still may be operator error.  The website claims that you can connect these an unlimited amount of times - and tech sites say it's very plausible up to 7.  I now have 3 and have issues.  Inconsistent connection and clarity in certain rooms and I have questioned the battery life and considered the connection struggle the cause.,4,1,2020-1-3,1,1,0
"This is the 7th one of this type of speakers our family has owned...yeah don't ask. Its the second JBL, the original model very similar to this cylinder I bought at Verizon on a whim 4 years ago for about $200. This was a fantastic speaker that my son snuck off to college with him...leaving me the cheaper  Costco and box versions.Its no surprise these little speakers have put the big ole speakers on the back shelf. This JBL Flip 4 is crystal clear. I can imagine some of the gut busting bass crowd complaining it doesn't stir your meal from lunch...the kind of bass that drowns out the music. To my ear, It has plenty of bass for 70s,80s, 90s rock and classical music....and more importantly....a good clear sound.",5,1,2018-7-23,1,2,0
"I am a married, mother of three, who likes to “unwind” with a few neighbors and friends occasionally. Tonight, amid the Covid-19 outbreak, The hubby and I were cooking hot wings and  feeding a few people, when we had a noise compliant. The JBL speaker that we’ve owned for a few weeks has gained us a “NOISE” complaint. And for the record, my husband and I are the supervisors of the deputies who had to answer the callFor that noise complaint. So, with that said, I highly recommend this speaker because the last time We had a noise complaint  was when we had a live band!",5,1,2020-3-29,1,1,0
"What a piece of junk... it worked GREAT when it actually worked. Then 3 months into very light use, and one day it just wouldn’t charge, turn on, or respond to any button combination. It’s turned into an expensive anchor.",1,1,2018-8-7,1,7,0
"Love this compact little speaker. I took it with me on a 10 day trip through Columbia - through the beach, city, and forest - and it worked perfectly. I've not submerged it in water but occasionally splashing it to keep it clean hasn't impacted its quality at all. As for the Bluetooth, the range seems to hold up; I've left my connected phone upstairs and it still plays well, so that does it for me.The only thing I have no positive comments on is the speakers' long-term durability. Up until today (about a month since delivery) it worked perfectly. But now, no matter how close my computer/phone is, the Flip 4 cannot play anything without skipping the audio semi-frequently. I'm hoping the issue will simply resolve itself, but this issue leaves me skeptical about the speaker durability and forces me to leave a 3-star review instead of the 5 I want to give it.",2,1,2019-1-27,1,3,0
"This is a great speaker.  Sounds bigger than it is. Charges fast and lasts a long time.  Pairs easily and sounds fantastic playing everything from Classical to Country, Rock to Reggae, and Progressive to Pop.  Although it says it is waterproof, I haven't tried to test that yet!  I'm sure it would survive a light splash or maybe a sprinkle of rain, but I'm not gonna throw it in a pool anytime soon.  I love its sound and I have dog ears.  I can hear the highs balanced with the lows.  Typically a speaker this small won't have any bass, but this speaker does fine.  Can use it as a speakerphone, there's an app where you could link dozens of them to listen to a single source, which would be great in a party environment.  Overall, this was a great product and I have yet to keep it a full volume for long since it gets louder than I need. When outdoors it is easily heard within 20 feet and not overbearing or sounding overblown.  Bass doesn't tend to fuzz out on this even with battery usage towards the end of charge.  I really like this little speaker for the cost and for the performance.  I'm very satisfied with this purchase and use it several times a week.",5,1,2017-10-25,1,3,0
"What a great speaker!!  I've been a DJ for over 20 years and I know good sound.  Now keep in mind, Bluetooth can’t hack higher quality audio as well as wired.  So if you are listening to this speaker via Bluetooth it's going to be a lower quality sound (not the fault of the speaker).  That being said, this speaker can push the base and hit the highs better than any other speaker at this compact size.  I originally bought this for my office, but the volume is just not low enough for that environment.  I had to get a cheaper speaker.  Now I carry this one around with me on the disc golf course, garage or just working around the house.  The battery life is excellent as long as you're not playing it a peak volume.  But I can say I don't always listen to Meatloaf when I'm in the garage, but when I do so do my neighbors.",5,1,2018-6-8,1,4,0
"I like JBL stuff. Really. But I gave this four out of five stars for a few reasons. First of all, I'm fully aware that this is a small speaker. Most of the reviews say that this flip4 is super. I think its merely good for what it is. Overall sound quality is good, but due to the small size, there's not alot of bass. Nice weight and feel to the speaker and the materials are top notch.  The sound doesnt really distort at full volume, but theres not much difference between about 70% to 100%. A little bonus is the lanyard attached to it. I added a carabiner clip so I can carry it anywhere. The waterproof design is great and the speaker feels very durable. However, when laid flat it tends to roll. JBL should have made the ends hexagonal so that it's immobile on flat surfaces. Nice to be able to listen to other media and take calls if needed on the phone. Also, the battery life sucks. I dont get more than 4 hours of playback before having to recharge. I've never tried to connect multiple speakers using the JBL connect feature, but maybe that's what makes these popular. I bought this during black Friday, so I got a decent deal, but I would not pay full price.Update 2/14/19",4,1,2019-1-25,1,2,1
Update July 11 2020I haven't even used this speaker up until recently. The battery is only lasting about 4 hrs. I bought my son one before I bought mine and his last about 12 hrs. He uses his a lot. I'm really bummed out and I paid more for mine than I did his. Bought from this same place.,5,1,2018-11-29,1,2,0
"I’ve had my JBL speaker for about eight months now. I’m still blown away by this speaker’s ability. It sounds incredible. I’ve tried many speakers in the past but none have come close to this. Before buying the JBL I had actually purchased a Beats speaker. I wasn’t sure which to go with at first and wanted to compare the Beats speakers with JBL. When I put them side by side, I could not tell any difference at first in the sound. I probably am a bit of an audiophile so I’m always looking for that clear, crisp sound. After spending some time with the speakers, I came to the conclusion that JBL sounded crisper or more pleasant to my ears. Not to confusion its loudness with its clarity I do think there is without a doubt a noticeable difference between the two. To get another opinion on the matter I asked a relative to do a blind sound test. I placed the two speakers in front of her and asked her to keep her eyes closed. She was to pick out the one that sounded more pleasant to her ears. Between each song I flipped the speakers around. I shuffled through different music genres. 3 times out of 5 she kept picking the JBL. Needless to say, the Beats speaker was quickly sent back. I’m happy with my decision. I will probably purchase more JBL speakers in the future.",5,1,2019-5-7,1,2,1

"The concept of bluetooth speaker is usually small cheap with low quality sound.  As technologies advances premium speakers now comes with solid construction, large drivers and high power amplifiers.  For those who is in the market for a cheap speaker will find hundreds to choose from.  No matter how good the reviews are for the Tribet, Oontz and UE Booms they are all run of the mill speakers that only satisfies the masses.  For high quality sound buyers usually have to step up to a higher price point.  While higher end Bose, Sony and Harmon costs over $200, half of that will get you pretty decent sounding speakers.  The Flip 4 looks great and its easy to carry, rugged and waterproof.  With 10 hours of battery life this little speaker can pump out clear highs and satisfying lows.  Voice sound natural and bass drum comes with a kick.  There are numerous placement options for the speaker and all controls are intuitive and easy to reach.  The clean upper range produced is a good sign that the component speakers are of good quality.  Driving 8 watts X 2 along with 2 side firing bass radiators the speaker has enough power to fill a medium sized room.  Like most I have been in the market for a good sounding speaker and have been disappointed time after time.  Realizing that a cheaper speaker will simply not satisfy my needs, going up in pricing to get the Flip 4 was the best decision I made.  If sound quality, portability and all-weather construction is important to you then you should spend to get this.  At $90, this little gem is better than the Bose, Harmon and Sony counterparts.",5,1,2019-9-26,1,1,0
"I have always been a JBL fan. I love the brand. So it's no surprise that I decided to upgrade to the Flip 4. Where to begin?First. The sound is great, for a portable speaker it really fills a room! My partner loves having it in the kitchen when he is washing the dishes, and I can hear the music through the house at a quality level (whether I want to or not ha!) I use it when I am in my studio painting, and can place it anywhere and still get great sound!",5,1,2020-3-3,1,0,0
Well before I begin I will say that I had already done my research and I already knew that the quality of sound was awesome what I did not expect was that when they claim it has 12 hours battery life at moderate volume levels they were not kidding I have run this thing up to 14 hours not had a single bit of problems its Bluetooth connectivity is great depending on the phone to you might have to look for it once in awhile but it always gets connected and stays connected to my phone when you're running multiple speakers for some reason on YouTube it seems to have some issue switching from one song to the next I discovered later on that this is a range between speaker 1 and speaker 2 if you have it too far away it will try to break up so I recommend keeping them within six feet of each other however the seeming connection issues always resolves itself within a few seconds of the next song beginning audio quality is awesome you really don't need the JBL app with them but if you want it feel free to use it I run mine without and I get perfect left and right stereo I was using a Samsung Galaxy phone I'm now using a moto Z3 and having no issues at all,5,1,2019-7-17,1,1,0
"Its really loud and gets the job done. Claims to have a 12 hour battery life, but unfortunately I cant get it to last for more than 4. Whether it is turned up all the way or not.Update: 3 months later it can barely even hold a 3 hour charge. :/",3,1,2018-2-19,1,2,0
"I do love this little speaker for its color, sound quality, durability, and portability, but the battery life sucks.  It was great for maybe the first year or so, but after a while I had to begin charging it after only using it for about an hour.  I only keep the volume about halfway up, only use it 1-2 times a week, and I don't have heavy bass on.  The battery life is longer with an aux cable instead of bluetooth (naturally), but I find the aux cables don't work really well with this - they get staticky and don't get full volume.  I've gotten used to keeping it plugged in to charge while I use it (though it never shows that it's ever fully charged anymore, even when charging while powered off), but for camping and hanging out by thr pool, I'd certainly prefer the battery life to be much longer.",3,1,2020-6-10,1,1,0
"I could not be more impressed with this product. The sound quality is excellent and the sound levels are impressive. Its so easy to pair with your phone and best part is, IT CAME CHARGED. JBL is doing it right!UPDATE: Still so so happy with this speaker and the battery lasts a very long time, I have listened for 12+ hours at times and the battery still has a fourth charge. And the LED battery life indicators are a big help for when you need to see how much power it has left. The amazing sound of these is impressive. And I have since bought another for a friend because I was so impressed with it. I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a good reliable Bluetooth Speaker.

"it get can get loud, not distorted, but maybe muddy? My iPhone 8 speaker sounds better truer quality, even with a lifeproof case on it, the sound quality is night and day. Due to the cylinder shape the sound projection depends a lot on which way you face it and what it's surroundings are. It seems like the bass comes from one side and the higher ranges come from the other. So they do not always blend clearly. Despite other reviews the battery life is my favorite part of this device. I would recommend not over charging. They say you can leave these things plugged in beyond the full charge but we all know that's bs. It severely impairs your devices ability to hold its charge long term. I came across a deal on Amazon and I jumped on it because I always wanted one. It was $60 I think. Normally these are up over $100. I would not be pleased if I bought this for $100-150. Even $60 seems a little high to be honest. Not enough to regret it, but the bass is not as loud as advertised, and overall sound quality is lacking. The material quality on the other hand is what makes it a bargain. I have no doubt it could take a splash of water poolside. But when it comes to sound it basically sounds like a tiny portable radio.",4,1,2020-3-17,1,1,0
"The most annoying thing about this speaker is the lack of track advance (at least) and fast forward/rewind buttons. The much cheaper Oontz speaker that this replaced had that functionality and sounded nearly as good.The JBL speaker wins in that it looks good, is very water resistant so we can use it near/in water without worry, and it really does sound great.",3,1,2018-12-26,1,2,0

So I bought this speaker a couple months ago but waited to write my review to REALLY see the quality of this product. I’m rating the 2 star simply for the quality of sound....it’s GOOD for in the House or office. Not so good outdoors if u want volume.The reason for my bad rating is the battery life. I’ve charged this product for plenty of time and yet it’ll still die out w/in an hour or LESS!! There r even times I have it on the charger charging while in use and it’ll STILL DIE🤦🏻‍♀️ Very disappointed because I had the older version of this product b4 upgrading to this one and it Performed much better.,2,1,2018-6-11,1,1,0

"I listen to Jazz that has deep base and high horns. I find that when I turned the volume up loud enough to hear the bass, the horns sound harsh. When I turn the volume down to make the horns listenable, the bass goes away. There is a sweet spot in which the bass and treble sound ok, but too quiet to be enjoyable to me. Plus, the speaker is designed not to roll backward, but there is nothing preventing the speaker from rolling forward. Ergo, when I put the Flip 4 on the dashboard of my car, the Flip 4 rolls off the dash when I accelerate. Had to send it back..",3,1,2018-1-31,1,1,0

"This summer I needed a new BT speaker and I tried a bunch of them in this size range and this one is by far my favorite.  It's about 95% perfect, which is about 50% better than all the others I tried.  It sounds AMAZING - it's among the loudest of the bunch, and it definitely has some of the best bass of them all thanks to the TWO side-mounted bass radiators.  It sounds better than all of the cheaper models, as well as better than most of the more expensive models.  Probably the SONOS and Bose Soundlink Mini sound better, but they are considerably more expensive and are not waterproof.  That's the thing - the FLIP 4 checks pretty much every box except two, which are relatively minor flaws.  I wanted something rugged, with a decent battery, good controls, great sound, and that was not too bulky.  Probably what we are all looking for.PROS:",5,1,2017-8-31,1,2,0

I want something that I can hear above road noise and wind.  This might do the trick but I don't want to get on the the road and find it gets drowned out by road noise, especially when I know that there is another product that delivers more volume.  It is also not drop resistant, a definite plus for bike riding.If I were purchasing for sound quality, it would be the JBL Flip4 hands down, as I am very very picky about sound quality.

"Lasted less than 5 months. Was a four-star speaker when it worked. Decent sound, good battery life, looks funky (in a good way), could use it in the shower.

The fastest I've ever seen a bluetooth speaker fail, and I've owned a bunch of them, from Oontz to Bose.Adding more to my review now that I've gone through the warranty process. I bought the red specifically to go with my decor. Harman Customer Service told me they couldn't repair or replace the JBL Flip 4 in red because they were out of stock. I pointed out that they listed it in stock on their web site. They replied that the web site is incorrect. So...either Customer Service is lying or their web site is lying. It's now been a few weeks and they did send me a different version in black, which I'm selling on eBay. Meanwhile, the version I bought is still listed as in stock on their web site.

I've had this a little over a year. The battery on it is garbage. Lasts maybe 3-4 hours on Bluetooth then completely dies. You know the battery is getting low because the speaker sound starts to scratch out. Trying to charge it is no good either. More often than not it randomly forgets what it's doing. Can be plugged in all night and I've got a quarter charge. Until I un plug it and plug it back in. Then it might finish..maybe. More hassle than it's worth at this point. Contacted the company and was told since I'm a month past the 1 year that I need to go spend more money with the geek squad to fix it. Very disappointed in this $100 speaker. Not a very good experience with the company either.,1,1,2019-10-11,1,6,0

"Let me be clear from the beginning that this is not a long-term review. I bought this product yesterday. That being said, I have just ordered another one to connect with it. That's how impressed with it I am.I had been using a big Geneva tabletop unit with wonderful sound for years, but it had an unfortunate accident. I bought an Oontz angle 3 to fill in while I made up my mind about what to do next. (It quickly became clear that the Oontz angle 3 is not something I'm going to use for music, though it's's fine for use with my tablet for streaming television. It is very reliable, its bluetooth connectivity is great, but the sound is flat and thin. The Flip 4, on the other hand, has a much richer and fuller sound.  Does it have the sound of my old Geneva unit? Probably not, but I can connect two of these! I can hang it out on the front porch or from a light fixture in the hall by its handy strap. It has connected easily to both devices that I have tried it with so far. I play a wide range of music, from metal to solo vocal, from Indian classical to ambient electronic.

If there are any cons, I have yet to notice it.the bass is superb as well. That's a big talking point for this speaker and it does not disappoint.

She’ll go days without charging it, even though she uses it almost every day. Quite frankly, I don’t think that I will ever buy another portable, Bluetooth speaker, unless it’s a JBL speaker. I have two now and both are great. Don’t look at other brands, just get a JBL.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,1,0
"First of all this speaker could be a defective one. Charging was bad, it was disconnecting frequently and turning off as if it was not charged which sometimes I had to used it while it was plugged, but minutes after I unplugged it turned off as if it was dead. Although it was connected to my phone, my daughter’s phone interrupted my music, sometimes she was watching stuff on her phone and I couldn’t listen to my music nor she was able to listen to her videos because the sound was stopped for both of us. When she put play my music stopped and when I put play her video stopped. It was just weird! I requested a replacement and I was ready to  The BIG ISSUE is UPS, my daughter told me that my speaker was gonna arrived yesterday, which I was expecting it 5/27/20 and I checked on Amazon and it said that it was delivered at 4:01 pm when I checked it was 4:08 pm, so it was nothing in front of my house (I live in the back on an alley and my address instructions is not to give my stuff to the neighbors because they steal them) so obviously I thought they delivered it to the neighbors.... awkward moment the following day (today) my brother checked the mailbox and it was in it?! So first they lied it was delivered yesterday and I had already started my refund and my comment about how mad I was that most likely my neighbors will be enjoying my speaker and now I had to return the defective speaker and in the end I will have no speaker.. seriously I was already looking to buy the same speaker somewhere else, because I thought UPS gave my stuff to my neighbors. Well, good thing I got the replacement before I bought a new one!",4,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
I got the product strictly for in-car use. Fits in the cup holder no problem and has excellent sound quality when in use. I only use the speaker for 20-25 minute drives twice a day. The speaker always comes home or is out of direct sunlight to avoid weather and temperature issues.Battery life based on my usage lasts for about 2-3 weeks when I first got it on a full charge. It eventually stabilized at 2 weeks. I listen to music at half volume.,2,1,2020-1-12,1,0,0
"I wanted to use this speaker so bad. When you feel the weight of the box, open it up and pull out this JBL Speaker, you know you are handling some high quality workman ship. The buttons give immediate feedback. You can just feel this baby in your hands, and you just want to turn it up and start beating to your tunes.......and that is where it kinda starts to make ya turn your head.I actually was able to give it a side by side sound test. The other Bluetooth speaker was of a lesser quality, a cheaper built. It's speaker where a bit larger. Not huge, but larger. It sounded way way better. I will be listening to that instead of this unbelievably build JBL 4 Flip.",2,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"Great sound, great durability, and I would definitely purchase one as a gift. I've had friends remark about the sound quality, being surprised it was coming from such a little thing.I've not tested the waterproofness, nor do I care to. It's fine right where it is on the dry countertop away from water sources.",3,1,2018-7-20,1,3,0
"First of all, I have to admit that the audio of the speaker is fantastic. I love it. I took this speaker all over the world with me.After having this speaker for less than two years, I started seeing three major issues:",3,1,2020-6-26,1,1,0
"I got this JBL Flip 4 open box, and if I paid full price, I wouldn't have rated it so highly. However, with the discount, this is one of the best options available right now.Battery life is very good. I don't find myself charging this often, but on the occasion I have to, it's back to full capacity quickly.",5,1,2019-11-4,1,1,0
"I weighed the options of purchasing the JBL Flip 4 vs. one of the similarly positioned Bose Bluetooth speakers, and ultimately went with the JBL because the sound quality was good and, at a sub $100 speaker, if it got lost or broken on the go, it wouldn't hurt as much as the Bose. I was super happy with it until, after only about a year and a half of light-to-moderate use, the battery started to falter. I'm aware of how to maintain lithium ion batteries and was careful not to use it in a way that would reduce the life of said battery. I also know that batteries don't last forever, but in less than two years, the speaker only works if it's plugged into an outlet. Since the warranty only covers 1 year, I guess I'm stuck. After doing some research, I've learned that this is a known issue with with speaker.In hindsight, I should have spent the extra money on a Bose.",1,1,2020-4-6,1,1,0
"I love it!  I paired it to my Android pad before I knew what was going on.  Easy!It has rich full sound.. I was playing music from YouTube on it and it was great.  I also played talk shows from iHeart Radio and SiriusXM.  My pad isn't always loud enough to hear over background noise.  With the Flip 4, I can turn it up and hear everything.  Also, with Sirius and iHeart, I can pause it if I need to interrupt my listening pleasure.  Can't do that with YouTube though.",5,1,2018-5-7,1,1,0
"After a full overnight charge, it played less than 4 hours at half volume before it died. ON THE FIRST DAY?! Says it plays 12 hours. Definitely not worth the price. I have a 25$ speaker that plays seven hours on one charge. Much less running time than I expected. If it needs to be recharged after just a few hours ,it’s Not enough value for my hard earned money. Its getting returned straight away. Yes, it sounds pretty good, and has decent volume, but if it only lasts a few hours on a charge it isn’t worth 80$, not to me. Maybe I got a “Bad” one? But then... if you do t have quality control, that’s on you, not me. Wasted time,and effort....",2,1,2020-8-5,1,1,0
"Recommend new purchasers dunk these in water and test the IP7X rating so you are covered under the warranty.  The IP7X rating says it should be able to be in 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes without a problem.  However, 2 years after purchasing, it fell in some shallow water off a canoe for just a few seconds and stopped working.  The interior was soaked and had a lot of water came pouring out when I disassembled it to hopefully dry it out.  Sadly it was out of warranty, but nothing was ever done to it that would have broken any seals that it should have taken on so much water in under a minute of being in less than a foot of water.",1,1,2020-6-30,1,1,0
"Put simply, this thing rocks! I have purchased multiple portable bluetooth speakers over the last few years and none compare in sound quality to this little gem. I initially purchased it to use outside when working on the lawn, sitting in the hot tub (since it’s waterproof) and taking up camping for some quiet background music while observing  the night sky. This speaker provides amazingly clear, beautiful sound that you can take anywhere. A buddy of mine recently purchased this same speaker after borrowing mine for a yard party and being overtly impressed with it’s ability to cover his large back yard and patio with background music.I listen to a wide variety of music and am generally pleased with the sound quality that this speaker provides. It is not the bass-booming speaker that you might get from a Bose unit but it holds its own with base tones and gives crisp, clear sound ... a quality I’ve found lacking in most of my previous bluetooth units. With it’s excellent portability, fantastic sound and reasonable price tag I can’t imagine why you wouldn’t own one of these.",5,1,2019-3-19,1,0,0
"After exactly 2 years, this speaker has failed. It served me well for awhile - I bought it for a trip to Europe when I wanted music on-the-go. Since then it has mostly lived on a kitchen shelf. It's portable, had nice sound and battery life. The white color was a mistake, I'll admit. It's now the color of a grungy bath towel that's been washed in hard water too many times. Whatever.But about 22 months after I bought it, it started to lose battery life. Now it'll barely last an hour before having to charge again.",3,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"Great sound!  I'm thrilled with the quality of the speakers and sound for the price.  I'm not an audiophile, just wanting some decent sound, and it certainly delivers that for me. I like the fact that I can take it around water and not worry so much.  Pros:  Looks and sounds great. Weight is heavy enough to make me think that it's well-made, and light enough to feel comfortably portable.  Cons:  I don't like it's complete cylindrical design because it rolls in such a way as to cause the power, volume, and connection ports to end up on the bottom (backside) out of easy reach.  But, it's not a deal breaker for me because I'm pleasantly satisfied with the other features.  It's just a small inconvenient annoyance. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.",4,1,2018-1-15,1,2,0
"I have preciously purchased the JBL Clips for listing to music in the shower and they work great. I guess others think they are pretty great too as I have had 2 of them stolen.  So I thought I would try something different this time around and I was pleasantly surprised.  The Bluetooth connectivity is way better with this model.  I used to have to wait a bit or manually connect when someone else had previously been connected.  With this its instantaneously and you can connect multiple devices at once.Example: It's Sunday morning, my brother was taking a shower listening very to music and you could hear it through the door. My mom was in the kitchen cleaning or something when she decided to listen to Sunday Mass on her phone.  And because both of their devices where connected mass started playing over my brothers music.  He was confused and angry because he couldn't get it to stop and my mom was confused because she couldn't hear anything and I just watched from the living room with glee.",5,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0
"I have had one of these for a few months and absolutely love it! So why two stars? Because I decided to get a second and do the stereo thing. The app is effectively useless and confusing. I can not get both speakers to show up in the app. It sees on or the other but not both. Five calls to support resulted in a lot of wasted time and no solution. The first call had me listening to some bonehead telling me I had to have three speakers in order to do stereo! Finally, on the fifth call, I managed to get the problem escalated. No solution yet.Update: I called the company a few times and, on the last call, I finally figured how to do the stereo thing.",4,1,2018-6-20,1,1,0
"This is a great speaker and I ordered 4 because of the ability to link up with each other with out wires (up to 4 speakers).My only ""knock"" would be that when they are paired up to each of the others, the battery power is used quite a bit. The bluetooth alone is an energy vacuum as it is.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"My Flip 3 died a slow and painful death, so I had to buy a new one. Deciding between the flip 4 and 5 wasn't too difficult. I'm a musician, so when I found out the Flip 5 played only in mono it was an instant deal-breaker.The Flip 4 is durable, waterproof, and very loud. I need to turn the volume down to just 3 clicks at work to keep it low enough so my boss can't hear it from his office. However, I blast it literally everywhere else I go. My car stereo is broken so I just set this thing on my dash and it powers through the noise of my open window going 80 up and down the HWY 101. I sing in the shower and it does a great job of overpowering my terrible voice, even when drenched in water, so that's a plus (I'm a drummer, not a singer). I also set it on my hood while washing my carblast week and the whole neighborhood could hear me blasting everything from metal to deep blues to K-pop. I'm just kidding, I don't listen to K-pop.",5,1,2020-6-30,1,0,0
"This thing was horrible.  I cant believe how many positive reviews there are.  I bought it to play my portable synthesizers through while kicking back on the couch or possibly busking.  It couldn't handle any bass.  I wasn't overloading it, I was playing at a comfortable level for watching TV while fiddling around on my synths.  The bass was basically an annoying 'doink'.  I bought a Mackie Home for $15 more and it sounds great.  Yeah, this weighs about the same as a Big Mac, but at the cost of fidelity.... I'd go for the the Prime Rib.",1,1,2020-7-11,1,1,0
"MY SON PURCHASED THIS AS GIFT TO ME FOR MOTHER'S DAY BECAUSE I KEPT USING HIS SPEAKER.  AT FIRST I LOVED IT, THAT WAS UNTIL I WENT TO LOWER THE VOLUME.  INSTEAD OF THE VOLUME GOING DOWN, IT ONLY GOES UP!  THE FIRST MONTH I HAD THE SPEAKER, THE BATTERY LASTED ABOUT 3 HOURS. NOW, THE BATTERY LASTS MAYBE 1 -2 HOURS.  MY SON'S SPEAKER BATTERY LASTS ABOUT 6 HOURS AND HE'S HAD IT FOR A FEW YEARS NOW.  STILL WORKS GREAT.  IT IS BEYOND EVIDENT THIS SPEAKER IS A PIECE OF CRAP.  MAYBE I PAID FOR A BRAND NEW SPEAKER AND INSTEAD RECEIVED A REFURBISHED PIECE OF CRAP?!?!?!  I HAD INITIALLY WRITTEN A REVIEW GIVING THE SPEAKER 2 STARS.  IT IS OBVIOUS THIS COMPANY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ITS CUSTOMERS OR ITS PRODUCTS BECAUSE OTHERS ARE HAVING THE SAME NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES AND NONE ARE REACHING TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  I ADVISE STAYING AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.  COMPELTE DISAPPOINTMENT",1,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"I purchased both the JBL Flip 4 and the Trelab HD77.  Both are good speakers for their size. I was impressed with the volume output from relatively small speakers, but found the bass disappointing in both.  Lack of bass is to be expected for the small size.  I did find that placing the speakers in a corner or under kitchen cabinets made a material improvement to the lows for each. I think you can get the same effect by placing them in a medium size open cardboard box as the bass reflects off the walls of the box.  I would be relatively happy with both, but ultimately I'm keeping the Trelab as it was 14 dollars less at 66 bucks compared to 80 bucks for the JBL Flip 4.  In addition, the trelab is slightly larger weighing in at 11 ounces compared to 9.2 ounces for the JBL Flip 4.",3,1,2020-9-8,1,0,1
"This beats the Douni A5.  It's smaller, compact but throws big sound.  Not obnoxiously too loud, but loud enough.  I put it on full blast, playing some heavy bass music and it stood the test.  The speakers did not blow out, which I had a problem with my Douni A5.Bluetooth pairs so easy with my iphone.  No stubborn connection at all.  I like the hidden buttons on my camo colored JBL speaker.  The control buttons are in black, but they are embossed, so you can feel them and not have to look where you are pressing.",5,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"Bought a 2nd flip 4 because I liked the 1st one so much.  I assumed that - since it's 2018 - the flip 4s would sync and sound great together.  Perhaps I'm missing something but the only way that I can get them to sound good is to link them through the JBL connect app and set them to party mode.  They stay in party mode for just a few minutes and then switch to stereo mode? or something besides party mode and the sound delay is not enjoyable.  The app fails to discover both speakers on a regular basis; even though they are inches from the phone.  I've tried restarting my phone, shutting off blue tooth etc etc.  Googling this issue shows that it's a consistent problem.  JBL should not be touting this product as ""pairable"".  Alone, the speaker is good.  When trying to play more than one at one time, I'm beyond frustrated.",4,1,2018-7-20,1,1,0
"I'm not a sound buff who sits in a chair savoring the true reproduction of a musical sound track, I just want something to push out a decent sound without distortion while I'm working in my workshop. This does a great job. The sound is full and satisfying. It's easily portable with several hours' battery life. I usually run it from my mobile phone, and the bluetooth connection is dead easy. You can control the volume on either the speaker or the phone.  I like that when a phone call comes in the music is muted, but I don't love that the phone call sound comes through the JBL device. I hope there's a simple way to prevent this, I just haven't bothered to look. All round, it's a great product.",5,1,2018-11-30,1,1,0
"I’m very glad I purchased speaker. I recieved this speaker as described. You can read the specs, and see that it’s waterproof and all that good stuff, (although I don’t plan on bringing it anywhere near the water). The Flip4 has amazing sound quality and great bass. You certainly get your money’s worth with this speaker. Normally worth around $110, I was lucky enough to get it for $79.95. It’s extremely easy to pair with your device, right out of the box. From opening the box to playing music from YouTube and pandora took only seconds. And the battery life lives up to its reputation. To put it in perspective, back in the 80’s and 90’s, you’d have to buy a huge, bulky stereo system to get a great sound like this. We’re living in a time where we get can get something this small and portable that delivers huge sound, so take advantage of it. Great for parties, or if you just use it for relaxation or working out. You’d obviously get an even bigger sound if you pair it with one or more other Flip4’s, (which I have not done yet, but plan on it).",5,1,2018-7-25,1,1,0
"After testing some lower quality Bluetooth speakers, I decided to try this one. A coworker has one, one day she was using it and I was amazed at the sound quality, bass, compactness.The speaker is waterproof too, a great feature. The buttons are low profile and work well. It has 2 speakers with bass radiator on both ends.",5,1,2018-8-28,1,0,0
"Considering the price, this is an awesome speaker! Of course, you can find some with better sound quality, greater volume, etc. but those speakers will easily cost you over $100. The sound quality and volume out of this speaker is great; comparable to a Bose Mini Soundlink (a speaker that is almost twice the price, and is not waterproof), and you really can't beat that.The waterproof functionality has worked well for me, although there was a brief period where I probably soaked it one too many times in the shower; the speaker would sporadically turn on and off back and forth multiple times throughout the day (very annoying). However, a day or two of leaving it alone and plugged in solved that issue (no issues since).",5,1,2019-11-13,1,1,0
"This speaker is awesome! The battery charge lasts hours!  The sound quality is amazing, hooks up easily to any phone with Bluetooth capability.  I have used it by my pool, at the beach in a hotel room, driveway party, tailgate and just about anywhere you need to listen to music.  The strap is sturdy enough to hang from a tent or chair. It stands up, it lays down. It’s even waterproof. It fell in the sand at the beach and I washed it off, shook it out and it was good to go.  Everyone needs one of these speakers!! I always travel with it.  The charger cord can hook up to any USB port. So convenient.  You don’t even need a wall plug.  This would make a great college dorm gift or gift the person “who has everything”.  I don’t leave home without it!",5,1,2020-8-14,1,0,1
"The look and feel of this speaker is amazing, so is the weight of carrying it around. Being waterproof truly helps as well, as I can use it while taking showers.The sound quality compares to Bose SoundLink (which my roommate has) except for may be for the bass, but nothing too. However, where is lags is the Bluetooth connectivity. It works most of the time perfectly with my phone, but goes haywire when I connect with my windows laptop.",4,1,2019-6-22,1,3,0
"I have, over the last year or more, purchased five (5) JBL Flip 4's.  Two reds, one blue, one triangle-pattern (forget the name), and one ""ocean blue"" (but promptly returned it when they shipped a standard blue).  I use these at work (production / factory floor) and it is impressive.  I love the water-proofing (mostly for the dust-proof aspect of it) as well as the durability and feel.  Connecting multiple Flip 4's to one another using the link button (near the power button) really opens up the audio experience!  They charge fast, have a good battery life (I work 12-hours+, typically and it holds up the entire day).  Even my oldest, first-ordered unit (red one), still keeps a great charge!  Impressive.I've had a couple of co-workers order some, as they always want to borrow mine (I only have 1 or 2 at work) and they were quite happy with theirs, too.  Overall, the JBL Flip 4 is a solid bluetooth speaker that performs as advertised.",4,1,2019-1-25,1,0,0
"I haven't had the Flip 4 for long, so I can't comment on reliability and durability, but as far as sound quality in a small speaker, I'm very happy with it.  Yeah, it's still has a ""small speaker"" sound, but it's the best small speaker that I've owned so far.  You just aren't going to get big speaker lows in a speaker this size.  Those tiny drivers just can't push that much air.  Still it does a respectable job.  It's seems very well constructed and if it is water resistant as advertised, it's a great value.  I am using it mostly with my Echo Dot's so far and i like it's portability.  I just tell Alexa what music I want to hear and if I move to another room, I take the speaker with me...within range of course...and the range hasn't disappointed so far. I would definitely recommend.  The only problem is that now,  I want to try all the JBL bluetooth speakers.",4,1,2018-1-6,1,1,0
"I bought this wonderful speaker thanks to hearing the sound from an older model my son bought for himself.  I absolutely love it!!I live in a townhouse with high ceilings.  This one little speaker sends my music throughout the house.  I am listening to it right now.  It is at the top of the stairs in our loft area, receiving music from my iPod which is about 20 feet away in my bedroom.  I hear the music throughout the house loud and clear and so wonderful!  I can do my chores and rock out with my 80s tunes!!",5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
This little speaker packs a real punch for its size. The sound quality on this speaker is very crisp and clear and the base is quite deep. I've owned and tested many other speakers in its class and they can't compare. The durability on this thing is insane! I've thrown it town a 50ft staircase onto asphalt and no problem occurred. I've dunked it in water in multiple occasions and nothing happened. The battery life of this thing is also kind of amazing! But I've got to tell you that this speaker has its limits due to its size. It get the best quality use it in small/medium sized rooms or a small outdoor living spaces. Something this size has its limits. Besides that I highly recommend this speaker if your trying you make your final decision.,5,1,2019-7-18,1,1,1
"You get a whole lotta sound from a small package with the Flip 4. Paired instantly and easily with iPhone and iPad. I experimented with different EQ settings on iPhone and found “small speakers” gave the best overall sound for the variety of music I generally play. Flip 4 handles bass, treble, and voice very well. The Flip 4 has volume and other controls that are easy to use but I tend to make those adjustments on the phone. It also can link multiple Flip 4 speakers to really fill the area with sound and now that I see and hear the quality I may get a second one to do just that. It seems very well made and durable but I haven’t tested the waterproofing and don’t really want to! Handles phone calls wit clarity. Battery life is supposed to be up to 12 hours, I haven’t pushed that but it has done 8-10 hr at medium volume without blinking. Like the easy to find bright orange charge cable. I read a number of independent reviews of portable Bluetooth speakers and the Flip 4 was always at the top of the rankings even though the price was middle of the pack. I am happy with This purchase.",5,1,2018-10-14,1,0,0
I'd give this JBL speaker 5 stars if the was a way to out it down on a surface.  But there is not. Theres a photo or 2 of it sitting on a surface but it is not clear that there is no part of the product meant to lay on a surface. so its meant to hang or be held on your wrist I suppose. I was bummed I had to send it back  it wasn't affordable way to have z fantastic quality portable compact speaker for under 100.

"I like the quality sound.  What I don't like is that turning it on and off, it makes a loud sound.  You cannot pair two bluetooth device to this when each of them within range of the speaker.  I did (my computer and my phone), and it shuts off my itself every 10 minutes or so.  Once I unpaired  from my computer, it works fine.

"This little speaker has outstanding sound quality.  And battery life too.  Love that I can pair it with my daughters and get even more powerful sound.  I bought a very similar 'Monster' speaker from Sam's and tested it out....and there was no comparison with the JBL.  The quality of the JBL allows you to hear dynamic layers of the music.  Other speakers sound ""flat"" in contrast.  The JBL also sounds loud outside....which is difficult for these little speakers with no walls to reverberate soundwaves off of.  The JBL handles it like a champ!  If you are on the fence about this....just get it.  You won't find a better one.",5,1,2017-12-5,1,2,0
"For it's price, 5 stars. It does what it's meant to do: play sound at a relatively loud volume (or quiet) and not rattle or static the sound. It's been outside, been in the rain, dirt, and been dropped many times and still looks brand new. I havent even needed to wipe it off. Everything just bounces off it. It does fine crammed in a full backpack and is fun to carry around on its strap tied to it that comes with the speaker. Its shape is attractive and smart looking. Just all around really amazing and includes the necessary buttons and plug in ports on places that make sense on the speaker.My only complaint is on full blast with the car windows down on the freeway, it's audible, but not quite loud enough. So its loud enough everywhere but a car freeway, airport runway, and freight train horn.",5,1,2019-6-15,1,1,0
"This is generally a great speaker for the price. There are a few confusing aspects though. For example, there is mention of stereo mode. And there appears to be two speakers, one on each end. But that is not what they are referring to. You can set two of these up in stereo mode with one for the left and the other for the right -- pretty expensive just to get stereo sound. You can also add several more speakers to increase room coverage for events.The smartphone app is not useful, at least in my case. For one thing it cannot find my speaker at all. I have seen suggestions that a firmware update is necessary. That is a terrible design. JBL advertises the app for that speaker and I downloaded the app the same day I bought the speaker. It should just work. PERIOD. But even if it did work, it has very little functionality. It can (theoretically) discover and connect for playing music. But your Bluetooth connection will do that just as easily. You can control the addition of other speakers to create a group of speakers all connected to the same source. That may be its main purpose.",4,1,2018-3-27,1,1,0
"I got this unit in the army green as an upgrade to a failed JBL flip 3 and I couldn’t have been more excited about it’s upgraded features,  huge and easy to access buttons, sexy look, and vibrant sound. Sadly, the enthusiasm lasted but a short four months. After said four months, the speaker started exhibiting a strange behavior. First when I would power I noticed that one of the four LED power level lights was out.  Shortly after that, a second LED failed and the next day all of them went the way of the do-do bird.No biggy. I can live without LEDs.  But, a few days after that, I noticed it would not except a charge unless I shook it. Within a week, even the shaking no longer worked and the unit is now a dang paperweight.",1,1,2019-6-1,1,1,0
Sounds better and is louder than the 3. Looks clean and well made. The sound is far improved to the last gen and other similar speakers. It’s one of the more expensive for a reason. The distance is great too. I have this strapped to my electric scooter and it’s able to overcome the wind noise. I take it to the beach throw it in the sand no worries. Did it mention it sounds amazing for a small speaker. Comparing it to others the treble and mids are so much more crisp then others. The vocals come thru clear and don’t hiss or sting or rattle. The bass is great for speaker of this size but to be honest my ear likes a rounded clear speaker more then a boomy low end heavy speaker most other millennials prefer. So if your a true audiophile then you will appreciate the rich and true highs and mids with a balanced low end. One of the better investments I have made.,5,1,2019-6-13,1,0,0

There is a major engineering fault with this product.I contacted JBL warranty via a web form a few days ago and have not heard back.

"I have one Flip 4 and am very satisfied with the sound quality so I purchased a 2nd one to link them together for stereo sound and increase the listening area around the house but the JBL Connect feature did not work well (when it worked at all).  Tried pairing the speakers using JBL Connect on two iPhones, they connected but the sound was distorted and often cut out.  Using it on my laptop did not work at all.  Streaming to the first speaker works well as designed but when I pushed the buttons to connect them, it simply disconnected the first speaker from the laptop.  Instructions are nothing more than a few graphics with no troubleshooting guide.  Rather than calling a support number and spending more time listening to recordings, UPS has it now and I'll just be content with the single speaker.",3,1,2019-5-25,1,1,0
"I am a restaurant manager with stagehand and sound engineering experience. This speaker is a good speaker if you play music at 75% volume your less. When working in a loud restaurant sometimes it needs to be turned up louder and this speaker doesn’t get as loins as some of the others I’ve had so at times, depending on the kitchen, it was too faint to really enjoy.BATTERY LIFE: is a huge issue. Incase you don’t know, the higher the volume the more power the speaker consumes. I had about 30% battery, I plugged it in to the wall and after about 30 min to an hour it was dead even though it was plugged in.",3,1,2020-4-17,1,0,0
"I really like the range of sound this JBL portable, water-resistant speaker offers.  Super easy to use, and pretty weatherproof as far as I can tell (haven't used it in massive rain).  My one complaint is that you can't rewind 15-30 seconds with the push of a button, you can only skip forward.  So great at an outdoor party when someone doesn't like the song playing, not so great when you're listening to podcasts and the speaker's intonation drops and you miss the last line of the point someone's making.  The point of the durability and limited controls on the speaker itself is so the device with the data on it can be tucked away in a safe place.  That means I need to pull that out from wherever it is safely stored to hit rewind on the streaming device instead of just hitting a button on the speaker.  Wish I had recognized this before I bought several to ""hook"" together around a large area.  So good sound, nice to look at, does what they say it will do.  Just no rewind.",4,1,2019-3-16,1,0,0
"These things have a pretty good kick to them, especially when paired together. Battery life is a bit low, so if you’re playing at the max volume, they’ll last around 3 hours or maybe a little longer... the waterproof nature of them is amazing and super convenient for bringing by water without worries. The pairing feature is a little buggy at times but still a very cool feature. When you pair them, one dies significantly faster than the other will so be prepared to have a charger ready for it.If you purchase this, it will only connect with other Connect+ enabled JBL devices. It will NOT connect with regular Connect devices. So some of the Connect+ devices include the Charge 4, Boombox, and Xtreme 2. The Charge 3, Xtreme original will not pair with this.",5,1,2018-12-6,1,0,0
I love the form factor and sound in most situations.  Some places it sounds great others it sounds marginal.  Placement is important for good sound.  I bring this to hotel rooms when I travel and it works great in that situation.  In a very open outdoor space it is a little less full sounding.  The battery lasts for several hours when it is working properly.  I purchased one a few months before this one and wanted another because I like it so much.  Now just after one year (the warranty period) it shuts down at random and has static sounds when playing.  JBL offered to send a replacement if this one is really defective!  Let's see how this works out.,3,1,2019-7-19,1,0,0
"Been looking for a relatively cheap option for a quality bt speaker to use while golfing and lounging outside, and I think the flip4 is the sweet spot.  20 and 30 dollar products just dont have the same functionality and rich sound you get with this speaker.It's extremely easy to use; I was listening to music within a couple minutes of opening the box. Came with 3/5 bars of battery power.",5,1,2019-6-22,1,2,1
"Out of the box, this speaker has decent sound: good bass for its size (not super powerful, but at you can tell what the bass line's doing). However, it sounds muffled, and of course the fact that its twin speakers are right next to each other doesn't do much for stereo separation or imaging. Comes with the territory of speakers this small, obviously. Fortunately, there's Viper4Windows or Viper4Android, free sound enhancers for PCs and Android phones. Viper's clarity effect deals nicely with the muffliness, and the 3D surround function (field surround on Android) adds some much-needed air. It's still not really compelling stereo, but it makes the listening more enjoyable, at least at close range (like at a desk).Speaker badly needs option to disable powerup/powerdown/bluetooth connect sound effects, and an option to stay powered on when plugged into USB power.",4,1,2018-9-20,1,0,0
I wanted to try something a little different in a bluetooth speaker. I'm a big Bose fan but my Bose color is a few years old and pretty banged up. The battery isn't holding a charge very long anymore so I decided a new speaker was in my future. I chose the JBL Flip 4 and I'm very pleased with my purchase. It pairs easily to my phone ( iPhone 8 ) and the battery life is fantastic. The sound is just as good if not a touch better than the Color. It is not meant to fill the room but it is very enjoyable to listen to. I'm very pleased with my choice.,5,1,2019-12-7,1,1,0
"I bought this in august of 2018... I still use this, and it’s May of 2020. That’s called craftsmen-ship. I haven’t ever seen any other Bluetooth speaker for less than a hundred dollars last over a couple months. I first actually bought this because I saw how long it’s been lasting my uncle. When I bought mine(almost 2 years ago) my uncles JBL flip 3 was I believe either 2 or 3 years old then!!! He still uses it and it’s treated him well. I’ve done my own little forms of(not quite stress-tests) but more towards feature checks. I tested if it’s waterproof and indeed I have brought it in my neighbors pool for a pool party’s last July(a year after I initially bought it) and it still was waterproof(and it says something when I dropped my Iphone X in there and it stopped working immediately and it’s rated for 3m). Everything it says it can do, it’s done so far. Definitely would recommend.",5,1,2020-5-26,1,1,0
"This speaker is not the smallest but the sound is good. The sound is not as clear as in a good stereo system but I did not expect it from a small single speaker. Nevertheless, the sound is good. It is warm and soft. I preferred it over UE that sounded more spacial and background. The base is not as low as I would like.It is easy to join 2 speakers into a stereo.",5,1,2020-5-23,1,1,0
"The bass output is fantastic, for its small size. The JBL Flip 4 is hooked up to my Samsung Note 9+, and I use it for hands free calls via its Bluetooth. No issues with that. The Bluetooth pairing process is simple, and rapid. Its my understanding you can connect these with another JBL Flip 4, to increase the sound volume, or simulate stereo. I haven't had the chance to try that, though. It is a quality built item, if a bit pricey. Nit-picking; it came with an outrageously ugly orange USB cord. It would be a bit more classier if they mated the cord color to the color of the JBL Flip 4; mine is Black, and the code simply clashes with it.  It fits in my briefcase, unlike the much larger JBL Charge I once had.  Also it would be nice if JBL made a stand or cradle for it. It is the perfect compliment to any cell, or laptop. I would highly recommend it to any potential buyer. Its said to be water resistant; but like any electronics, I wouldn't want to test out that capability!",5,1,2019-3-26,1,1,0
"I bought four of these for a party I was hosting where we didn't have access to the built in speakers. I had a couple options, I have other bluetooth speakers, but I would only be able to connect one to my phone and play from one end of the room. The other option was bringing my bookshelf stereo system from 2004 to the party and spread the speakers out as far as the wires would allow but again it would only be on one side of the room so I would have had to blast both options in order for the other side of the room to hear it, thus making the people closer to the speakers hate me. SOO I found these and ordered four to try out in my situation. I connected one to my phone then the other three to the source speaker. I was able to put one speaker in each corner of the room and flawlessly stream spotify from my phone and have a nice volume level throughout the hall. I had numerous people ask me how I was playing music all over and I introduced them to the speakers. In fact my step father liked them so much he bought two of them from me (I had no need for four after that day anyway so it worked out for me) I have used the remaining two speakers numerous times since I bought them, most recently at the beach on my family vacation. I was able to leave my phone in the truck, stream music to both speakers and provide music amongst 5 pop up tents, the only struggle was finding the kind of music everyone enjoyed! :P",5,1,2019-9-4,1,0,0

"I bought the teal one because I didn't want to have another black speaker in my house, and it's much easier to find! The sound quality is BONKERS! It's so clean and clear (my test song is ""Hey Mami"" by Sylvan Esso because it's got great bass and fun highs). The battery life is really crazy. I took it on a 1 week road trip, and used it for about 10 - 12 total hours. Never recharged it. But the cool thing is it shows you the battery life (in white circles) when you turn it on. Speaking of turning it on, I love the sound it makes turning on and off, like a fun guitar noise. It's DEFINITELY water-proof. I took it in a pool, and used it in the shower (hung it from the shower head). It's fantastic. I LOVE IT. The fact that you can daisy chain a bunch, and that you can connect multiple devices at once makes it the best. Seriously one of my best purchases of 2018!",5,1,2018-11-1,1,0,0
"Bought this for the shower to listen to music while getting ready for work. Pairing the speaker to my phone was extremely easy. Previous speakers I had lacked range.

"I will leave the technical stuff and basics to others because as Dozer said to Neo, “It’s major boring sh*t.”  What you really want to know is how it sounds. This little speaker produces the best midrange you will ever hear from a speaker anywhere near its size.  The highs are also very transparent but perhaps just a tad bit soft. Most folks would probably never notice the roll-off.  There is no deep bass here although mid bass is what I would describe as moderately well presented.  Let’s be honest. Do you really expect this little enclosure to produce earth shattering bass?  If you do, I have some prime real estate located in the Florida swamps I will sell you at a discount.  However, I promise you will be blown away by the midrange where much if not most commercially recorded music resides.  Clean, accurate and palpable.  Worth every penny.",4,1,2019-1-31,1,0,0

"I ordered the teal version for my wife as a mother's day gift because it's her favorite color and this speaker had generally favorable reviews.  A lot of other portable speakers have unattractive designs or color options, but this hits the mark.  Pairing via bluetooth was easy on an iPhone XR and Android phone.  I have not tested the app, but it's not needed unless you want more advanced options or pairing multiple speakers.  Speaking of, this speaker has the ability to connect to other JBL speakers to create a sort of surround sound environment.I'd highly recommend this speaker to anyone looking for one.

I couldn't figure out how to turn this unit On at first.  Lousey instructions!  I went on line and watched a Video and realized I just wasn't pushing down hard enough on the On button.  At first the Unit seemed to have too much Base and I was able to adjust the sound quality via my LG phone using the Equalizer graph and was amazed to see how well the speakers preformed over the entire range of music and different types of songs.

"Amazing sound quality, it gets surprisingly loud for its size, & the sound still sounds BEAUTIFUL even turned all the way up.. the battery life is incredible.. it can almost last through an entire bartending shift when I’m working in the service bar & DJing all night.. I LOVE the color 💘💘 the sea foam green is bright & so pretty. Even comes with a great quality, JBL micro usb charger cord. Very sturdy speaker too. This thing is sturdy AF. It’s also small enough to easily fit in a purse, drawstring backpack, or even in a sweatshirt pocket.  If you’re looking for an amazing, high quality speaker to carry with you & use everywhere... camping, boating, work/work sites, beach, parties, hiking, THIS IS YOUR SPEAKER.

I wound up opening it up to see if there was something obviously wrong and didn't see anything. I disconnected and connected some of the wires inside and that didn't do anything either.This is the first time I've dropped it, and it only fell a foot or two. I've taken very good care of it and never really did anything crazy with it. Turns out it's not very rugged at all.",1,1,2019-9-4,1,1,0
"Never got it to play.  The printed instructions are a joke, leaving out many crucial steps.  Their phone tech support was somewhere far, far away with terrible audio connection and someone with little English language ability.  Also sounded like she knew absolutely nothing about the device.

No idea of the sound quality or battery life.",1,1,2019-4-29,1,1,0
"The sound quality was very good, in the limited testing I did.  My goal was to use these (I bought two) as additional speakers for my TV, or to use them instead of the TV's built-in speakers.  The TV is not natively Bluetooth-capable, so I bought a third-party Bluetooth transmitter (1Mii B03Lite), connected to my TV via optical (TOSLink) cable. I also wanted one speaker to provide LEFT channel only and the other speaker RIGHT channel only, for true stereo, rather than having each speaker provide both left AND right channels.  These speakers ARE able to do this, but only through use of the JBL Connect app on your phone or tablet.  I was concerned that the left/right separation would work ONLY while the phone was connected, which it normally wouldn't be in my scenario.  However, once turned on in the app, the left/right separation continued to work, even when the phone was off and the sound source was the Bluetooth transmitter connected to the TV.  The big problem -- and this might very well have been the fault of the transmitter, not the speakers -- was that there was a 1-2 second delay in the sound coming from the TV, so that the sound did not match up with lip movement.  That made the TV essentially unwatchable.  Because of this problem, I will need to return the speakers and the Bluetooth transmitter.  I will cross-post this review to the BT transmitter, as well, so that people know that it's the COMBINATION of the two that doesn't work as hoped.  The speakers themselves seem to work well, albeit in limited testing.",4,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"I purchased 2 of these with the intentions to run them is stereo.  Well I was very disappointed that the default mode to connect 2 or more is mono!  In order to get them to connect in stereo you nave to use the Connect app which is not available for Windows.  Besides the inconvenience with have to use the app, the application only works 50% of the time. and will intermittently switch back to mono when a video is changed in YouTube.  If JBL would release a firmware update to change the default connect mode to be stereo! I will change my rating to 5 stars!  Build, sound and battery life are all excellent!",3,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"This speaker is pretty good. Looks good, it can be loud, and its easy to use. There are a few problems though that are significant.1. The bass is hard to hear unless you're playing bass heavy songs. It needs to be like 50% louder.",3,1,2018-10-10,1,1,0
"First things first this is a pretty great speaker, well built and loud rich sound. I use this mainly at work and I have no choice but to max out the volume and throttle the volume with my phone anywhere from 80% to max. This speaker can handle it with no problems. The downside to that is the battery life is about 1.5-2 hours tops in perfect working order. You could maybe get another 30 minutes with a charging cord but it can keep up with the draw. In a home setting or even outdoors you would probably never have to raise past half volume and the battery lasts hours upon hours. My problem currently is the battery and charging system. I may get 45 minutes tops plugged in before it cuts out to continue charging. Turn it back on it shows I have about half charge but cuts back off in minutes. I'm sure I killed the battery after a good year of cranking it to 11. Would still recommend this speaker to anyone looking for big sound in a small package for normal settings around the house and yard or on the move at a lake or park.",4,1,2018-11-25,1,1,0
"The speaker sounds great and has fantastic battery life. However, I bought this to pair it with my JBL charge and the results are just okay. When they are paired and it's working smoothly, the sound between the two is AWESOME! I was a little disappointed at the connectivity though. The speakers must be in close proximity to each other and close proximity to the phone or device playing the music. I would say they can be about 25-30 ft from each other and the device you're playing music from has to be dead center. This is my only complaint, if you move the speakers any further, or walk off with your phone even a little, you'll notice clipping and unpairing. It's a little annoying because when you walk back into range, the speakers dont automatically reconnect, you have to manually go back into the app and re-pair. Battery life is incredible, this weekend I had just this one speaker going at about 100% for an easy 4-5 hours and still had plenty of battery life left.",4,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0
"I bought my first Flip4 from Walmart. It has good sound for a small speaker. I bought my second one off Amazon. It sounds as good as the first. The problem (and reason why I'm returning this one) is that there really is no real stereo when you use two, so having two is pointless. It says it's in stereo mode but there is no difference from one speaker to the other. And when in ""stereo more"" the two speakers play out of sync. Very disappointing for an $80 speaker.",1,1,2019-6-30,1,1,0
"Please keep in mind my main issue with this is with the app, not so much the speaker.I bought a projector recently and was looking for a good speaker to kinda use as a soundbar, this one popped up and I decided to try it. Overall the speaker itself I love, I’ve never tried JBL before this, instead I’ve always been a fan of Ultimate Ears. My main two complaints over the speaker are I wish it had flotation like the UE products do, and when using the aux plug-in if the audio you’re playing has a “quiet” moment, the speaker will stop playing, and once it “detects” sound again it’ll have a 0.5 second delay, which for some people that can turn you away, especially since I use it while playing movies/video games and a lot of those have quiet moments and in the process of coming back it’ll miss a character’s short line of dialogue or an important audio bit. This isn’t a problem I’ve had while using Bluetooth though.",4,1,2020-6-18,1,0,0
"UPDATE: it’s now August 2019, and after a year of normal use, it now only holds a charge for 20 minutes and refuses to charge fully.I bought this having been impressed with the JBL flip 3 that a friend brought along on vacation. After years and years of just sticking my phone in a bowl (which never really gets *that* loud, let’s be honest), I decided to invest in this, and figured the newer version would work just as well (only major difference between the flip 3&4 seems to be the waterproofery, I think?). Can’t beat it for price/quality/portability combo. Color is super cute too! I was/am very impressed with the packaging and the fact that it was mostly charged out of the box. It gets VERY loud (can hear from every room in my house) and has great bass. I love that it fits in a cup holder too. Would definitely recommend!

Extremely solid construction, and water proof as well!

These speakers have not been working right since I purchased them a year ago. After playing for about ten minutes the Bluetooth connection becomes unbearable and skips and has fuzz. I thought it was my phone’s fault this whole time but after using my brand new phone with these speakers they had the same problem :( I am ready to throw them in the garbage it’s so frustrating having skipping music I turn it off after ten minutes every time. I cannot listen to music like this!!!!!,1,1,2019-11-15,1,1,0
"So it sounded great. Much better than my first BT speaker, Anker's Soundcore. Of course, this one is more than double the price and it did sound about twice as good. Unfortunately, it has a bit of a hiss when plugged into power and idle. I have the speaker on a little shelf at the head of my bed and listen at night if I wake up and can't go back to sleep so it is always plugged into power and always connected to Echo Spot. I really liked it and wanted perfection but if I didn't have something playing it would hiss and after a few days of being connected it would have a little click or actually more of a micropause very regularly every 3 or 4 seconds. It resolved with restarting the speaker, and honestly, I'm not 100% sure this part was the speaker's problem or Alexa's problem but since it also had the hiss, I had to return it. I know most people don't keep it connected and plugged in all the time so it may not be a problem if you regularly cycle the power and turn it off when not using it.",3,1,2018-9-8,1,0,0
"Let’s start off with the things I don’t like. First to support the cons, you need to know that this speaker is quite compact and isn’t this huge speaker to be able to create a large bass sound. This leads me to my one con. I’m not one to listen to a lot of bass heavy music but this speaker doesn’t have the most bass. In it’s class, I do believe that this speaker takes the win for bass. It does have bass though for listening to just about anything.Now to talk about the pros, on the exterior appearance and ruggedness of the speaker, this thing is great. I have the ocean blue and it is quite a sexy color. I bought the gray one before and gave it to my brother and his is still kickin’. The Bluetooth connectivity is flawless without a doubt. The battery life stands tall and it doesn’t take forever to charge. I can even use a portable battery pack to charge it and it charges even faster. If you keep the volume at about half it lasts quite long.",5,1,2019-8-14,1,0,0

Now with connect plus, you can connect numerous speakers together. I comnected mine and my Dads and sounds amazing. Need a liitle more bass? Use connect plus and an extreme and the neighbors will love you. These things are well worth the price, and live the JBL sound. Move over Bose, you have competition.",5,1,2018-3-2,1,1,0
"Where's the option for 10 stars? This has jaw-droppingly rich sound. I couldn't believe my ears as I stood in awe listening to this play 2Cellos' ""With or Without You."" The acoustics are absolute perfection; crystal-clear, with base notes having real depth and vibrato to them as if I were listening live. Simply amazing. I bought this because my friend had a waterproof speaker from another brand that we took kayaking with us - hers cost twice as much as this one but this one is smaller and sounds incredibly better. I am in auditory heaven!UPDATE: 7/23/2017",5,1,2017-7-21,1,1,0
"Great speaker. Excellent frequency range and clarity. I work in a diesel shop and I can hear it really good and for me with the speaker at 60%ish volume on a full charge it lasted 7.5 hours which I'm fine with. Really impressed with the battery life to sound quality ratio. Down side is that I never heard a low battery warning. But then again, I work in a noisy shop. I've had it for a week and am very happy with the purchase. It's also cool to watch the subwoofers on the side.",5,1,2018-11-21,1,2,1
"Bought this for my backyard to link up with my JBL charge 3. Took forever to link up, had to link it by the app but once it finally got done I was able to link them together.The flip isn't as good as the charge 3, I should of just bought another charge 3.",3,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"I ordered this waterproof Bluetooth speaker to take with me while kayaking and it does not disappoint! It fits perfectly in the bottle holder forward of the seat. During the latest kayak trip a small storm rolled in causing choppy waters. As the waves buffeted my small craft the speaker was drenched in water. It even sat in standing water as the bottle holder filled up. Nonetheless it continued playing the entire time without any problem. It has great sound for being about the size of a pint beer can. It won't fill up a room, but it isn't meant to. For the beach, water sports, biking, hiking, and all kinds of outdoor and indoor activities where you want portable sound, this is great! Also, you can apparently connect up to 100 of these together and have them all play from the same source. I might get another...Update: got another speaker and have been unable to pair them together in stereo mode! The app that you need to get them to work together is terrible! Reduced my rating from 5 stars down to 3 because of the abysmal app.",5,1,2018-7-4,1,0,1
"Quality little bluetooth speaker.  Sounds good, especially when i'm watching movies on my ipad or laptop when I'm on the road.  I don't know if the sound is any better than other similar speakers, but the selling point for me was the integrated speakerphone/microphone for the speaker.  It really improves the sound on conference calls using my cell phone.  There have been times multiple people were gathered around my iphone, but this works great and sounds way better.  I originally purchased the flip5, but exchanged it for this one because of the speaker phone option.",5,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0
"The sound quality on this product is amazing no matter what the Volume is, I'm writing this review on March 2020, have had the speaker since November 2018, it was all great until a few days ago when the speaker will not last half an hour at a medium-high volume, it will start making weird sounds and turns off. Seems to be the battery is dead, I gave it an average use over the months, it used to last a week and a half or 2 weeks on a charge based on the use I had with it. Don't really know if this time frame is fair for the battery to die, or if something went wrong with it and it's an early death. I would definitely buy one again, however, I do think it went bad earlier than expected.",3,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
"I'd like to start this off by saying this, the speaker was great while it worked. I am a college student, and I bought this speaker thinking it would be great to play some music while hanging out with friends in the dorm, maybe while I'm taking a shower, etc. It was a bit pricey, but the reviews were good and I had a few friends that said nothing but good things about it. Now, I have had it for a few months and I can't use it any more. One day the power and linking button's stopped working, the LEDs and everything. So while the speaker still worked, I couldn't turn it on or off. Eventually it died and now I can't use it.I am very disappointed in this product as it was marketed as being durable, however, didn't last more than 4 months of mild use. I would not recommend you buy this product if you are looking for a product that would last.",2,1,2018-1-14,1,4,0
"ok I have 2 boys and a husband who loves music. We have been through our fair share of portable speakers. I even just in the last year purchased a small portable Bose (the small squarish one) and this speaker completely blows it away.This is actually our 2nd time to buy this one. The first one was for my son, and this one was for me. You can pair the 2 together and get great surround sound, they are handy by the pool, or water and seriously, they sound AMAZING!",5,1,2018-9-16,1,0,0
"The JBL Flip 4 has amazing bass and it is the best portable speaker that I have ever had! The sound quality when turned up high, is amazing as well! The only thing I dislike is the battery life. I definitely have not gotten 12 hrs battery life out of this in one charge like it says you will get. But it charges fast and I hope that it stays that way. I also was able to listen to music while it charged. I read a review where someone said you cannot listen to music while it charged, but I did! Also, I work in a huge kitchen that serves 750-800 people each meal, and this speaker can be heard above all of the choas of everyone in the kitchen and it isnt even turned up all the way, the sound stays crisp and clear, good job JBL, Thank you!",5,1,2019-3-2,1,0,0
"Love this speaker. My favorite wireless speaker I've ever purchased. Crisp uppers, clear mids, and booming bass. Not to mention when paired with a travel case it is an amazing travel speaker. I always have the travel case latched to my travel backpack so its a zip up away for a trip or going out. Its a very sturdy speaker in regards to water and dropping. I haven't tested this but it is evidently water proof. It has a long battery life too. I can listen for a few hours and see now drop in its 4 or 5 battery level indicators. From what Ive read, the only speaker I would look at instead of this is its practically identical Charge 3 or 4? I guess its an even more powerful version of this speaker. Which is surprising because this thing is amazing.",5,1,2018-5-15,1,0,0
"When I received my Flip 4, I was impressed with the sound and ease of use.  However, almost immediately, it started to skip in a random pattern.  Sometimes it played for a a few minutes before skipping.  Boy, was that annoying.Instead of using my computer and Bluetooth transmitter, I switched to my phone's Bluetooth and the pattern continued.  Thinking the Bluetooth range was limited, I tried using the Flip 4 right next to my phone, and right next to my computer.  No luck.",2,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
I chose this speaker because I've had excellent experiences with JBL and wanted  high quality.  After receiving I had trouble getting my iPhone and laptop to recognize it.  I contacted this seller thru Amazon to explain my problem and ask for help.  The owner of the store contacted me immediately and patiently walked me thru the process.  Later his technician called to follow up.  Customer Service is what it's all about.  They went above and beyond what I normally expect from a seller.  The speaker is exactly what I expected and this seller was amazing.,5,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0

"This is hands down, the best purchase I made last year! I have decent audio systems in the house, but find myself using this more often when I'm just in the kitchen, or when I'm in the shower, or when I'm outside. It works well outside when we have BBQs, and is loud enough for our backyard. It's definitely loud enough in the house and can easily fill a large room. I often use it as a car speaker when I'm driving my vintage car that doesn't have speakers. It's good even with windows down. The sound quality is excellent with good balance and mids, and the waterproofing is a nice feature since I use it when camping too. It's super rugged and durable... used it a ton and have taken it many places this last year. It charges fast, and the battery life is great! It'll last a decent chunk of the day on higher volumes.",5,1,2018-5-31,1,0,0
"Bought this due to the connect+ feature to connect with my teammates on bike rides - and because it was a great deal on Black Friday. I haven't used that feature yet as winter has stopped all of our team rides, but I've taken it out on my own several times and it is GREAT. The sound quality and volume have topped any of the several other speakers I've tried and it's gone through mud and slush with no difficulties. On top of that, the battery life is great - I use an old iPod Touch for music when I ride to avoid killing my phone battery and the speaker outlasts the iPod's battery life. Very excited to get lots of use on the trails without having to charge it every single time!",5,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0

"Sounds ok, but my Boss SoundLink Mini II sounds much better. I do like that the Flip 4 is weather resistant, and it's more mobile-friendly than the Bose. It's great for taking to the pool.

"Been listening to it a bit here and there since it arrived a couple of days ago. My Avantree Cyclone was stolen so I found myself in the market for another small portable Bluetooth speaker. I liked the (decent enough) sound from the Cyclone and the basic cylindrical shape, and I kept these factors in mind whilst searching for a replacement. After reading through many lists and reviews I settled on the Flip 4. Although I haven’t much previous experience with JBL products, this speaker seems to be good value for the money. Nice features, quality of sound and handy size. Everything arrived as advertised, super easy to set up and start using right away. For people bagging on this small speaker not having enough bass, I don’t know what their experiences or expectations are, but I think it has a good, balanced sound between bass, mids and highs. Perhaps those complaining need to make appropriate adjustments to their EQ’s for the music they’re listening to? This speaker cost over twice as much as my Cyclone, and I’m hoping it serves me as well in the foreseeable future. I can't speak to battery life just yet, haven't had a chance to give it a workout yet. Thanks for reading.",5,1,2019-2-2,1,0,0
"Great little speaker until it wasn't. Worked great for almost two years. Then one day it wouldn't turn off. Just would not turn off when pressing the power button. Googled and found a factory reset trick. Didn't work. Had to disconnect from Bluetooth on my phone. Battery eventually died. Plugged it in to recharge and it lit up like it was recharging, but now will not turn on. Very disappointed. Called JBL and they said it's out of warranty and can't do anything. No suggestions. So frustrating that everything is ""disposable"" now.",1,1,2019-7-29,1,2,0
"I replaced my iphone to the 11. I had to reset the device because it would not brodcast the bluetooth signal. While doing this the Flip powered down. It looked like it reset. However, Now it will only light up when I plug it in. The battery is new and the device is not that old. When researching the issue it is a known issue. The board that controls the buttons has gone bad. Now it is a just a paper weight. I will never buy JBL again. This is a known issue that they have not fixed.Update... contacted JBL and they replaced the item without any issue. I have changed the rating to 5 star.",5,1,2020-4-6,1,0,0
"I've been using it almost daily for 20 minutes to 2 hours for almost 1 1/2 years now.SOUND: It sounds almost as good as a full blown stereo system, if not better depending on the stereo. The only thing that makes an actual stereo a little better is the fact the speakers aren't combined into one unit and the sound comes from multiple directions (but I'm tempted to get a 2nd one to fix that).",5,1,2020-2-22,1,0,1
"This is an amazing speaker.  I've used it multiple times on our back patio, around bonfires, working around the house and more.  As long as you have a good wireless network, this connects flawlessly and sounds great!  For the price, I highly recommend it.  If your expectations are higher, then spend more money on something else.  For me, this is perfect for the price.",5,1,2019-8-12,1,1,0
"I must say that sound is rather disappointing. This speaker is way overpriced for the sound quality it delivers. If you’re looking for a small, portable speaker to take for a trip, or to the beach, it’s okay, though even than it could be smaller. If you not that concerned with portability and looking for a great sound for a deck or backyard or even inside, this is NOT the speaker to buy. Try Harman Kardon Onyx Studio instead that you can get for about $100.",3,1,2019-9-5,1,1,0
"First of all the JBL Flip 4 sounds great, no doubts. Unfortunately the unit has a bad battery that dies shortly after a couple of months. First you will start noticing the battery last less than usual, then it takes longer to 'fully charge'. Mine started this way, now it's useless, it can take several hours to supposedly show fully charged and it may work for 15min before dying.Warranty? I've never heard anybody was granted a replacement.",3,1,2019-8-6,1,0,0
Just took this to Mexico so I could play my music. Quality of sound is very good. It is light enough to easily pack and it made my cocktail parties a big success.

For the cost of this speaker I expect FAR better.",1,1,2019-6-14,1,2,0
One of the best speakers you can buy. FW update gives you a little more bass. The size the sound the speakerphone everything is great on this speaker. This is my 5th Flip 4.

"We love our JBL!  We purchased as it interfaces with our Peloton bike.  I really wanted the in studio feeling - (I like loud music when I work out) so it works perfectly for this!  It's also great as we can grab and go with it if we are taking a trip or out where we would like some music going.  My only feedback would be - it would be great for this model to also come with some sort of base or feet that can help it sit up nicely.  The ends are the bass so I hang it from the cord (not the charging cord) it came attached with from a hook near the bike!  But, I would prefer it to be sitting near us without having to stand it on end or it roll away.",5,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0
"I use it by the shower since it is waterproof.  It works very nicely and sounds pretty good for such a small speaker.  I feel like the battery life isn’t as long as it’s supposed to be, but that’s not such a big deal to me.  I do wish it had buttons on it that would allow skipping to the next song, so that I don’t have to touch my phone when wet (although it’s waterproof too, I try not to).  It only has volume buttons, play/stop, and a Bluetooth button.",4,1,2018-8-25,1,1,0
"If you are looking for great sound quality, long battery life and the ability to connect two speakers for great sound in a large area (or just use one), without spending $100's of dollars- your search is over.

"Let me start by explaining I used this sparingly over the 8 months. Mostly to trips overseas, poolside. At first, it was a really cool joke to pull on people.....(Sir/Maam, can you hold this for me, then drop it ""accidentally"" into the pool and watching people's faces during and after I pull it out of the water. Absolutely hilarious.)However, on my last trip I packed it in my carry on, and never used it. Took it out and tried to use it over labor day weekend.....to find it completely dead. I mean, I literally could not have used it more than 30 times. I think it maybe the battery may have been faulty. I am in the process of RMA'ing this but I am completely annoyed that I have to go through the hassle.",2,1,2018-9-7,1,0,0
"It might be a little pricey but I think it's worth it. I really love this speaker. it came really professionally packaged, with foam and a magnetic box. was super easy to connect to my phone. The speaker feels really solid in your hand, and doesn't feel cheaply made. I have been using it for the past week and I only have charged it once. The battery life lasts very long if you remember to turn it off when not using it. The sound quality is really nice and loud, and fills out a room well. the bass is actually really good, and you can actually feel the bass at the top and bottoms of the speaker. shipping was easy and came quickly with no hassle. one thing is when it is standing upright since the bottoms aren't perfectly flat it tilts a little bit, but that just annoys me and doesn't detract from the product. I love the fact that it's waterproof so I can use it in the shower. Overall I am super satisfied and would recommend this to anyone who wants to invest in a good quality durable speaker.",5,1,2019-1-6,1,0,0
"For this price range I find the sound of this speaker to be excellent. It has an excellent range of sound concerning treble and base. I personally prefer this over the beats pill plus and I like the sort of fabric mesh that lays over the drivers. At the end it's like a hard rubber or tpu in case you drop it it'll take the shock of the drop. Over all, I am thoroughly impressed. If your wondering why I gave it only 4 stars it's because it's no sennheiser. The most bang for your buck and you can't tell it's cheap say like a soundbot model.In the photos the blue USB is a separate cord, but still USB, and the Orange one is the one that is provided with the speaker. I found that to be unique and useful that the pin portion was flat versus the standard USB.",4,1,2018-2-26,1,1,1
"I love this speaker to take to the beach, pool, or anywhere outdoors. The sound quality is great and the volume gets pretty loud, but the battery life is horrible. It takes maybe 2-3 hours to fully charge and will be completely dead after about 4 hours. I have to charge this hours before I plan to use it and sometimes it dies within the first two hours. I really wish the battery lasted more than one use, it's super annoying trying to entertain with this speaker because it will likely die in the middle of it. Luckily I have a larger speaker that plugs into the wall, but I still use this for shorter duration outside.",4,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"For those considering this over hyped product; this particular example is adequate to listen to low levels (easy to talk over in a medium quiet voice) background music, at distances of arm length or more from the speaker; AFTER the painfully bright high frequencies (above 1K Hz) have been equalized own from 1 to 3 on a Samsung phone equalizer display.The Samsung phone volume is at 9-10.",3,1,2018-11-12,1,1,0
"I love the sound of this speaker, I often have to listen to music at about half volume because the sound is that loud. The only thing I can say that I don't like about this speaker is that it likes to have pairing games with a device that gets paired to another device besides itself. It will stop playing sound about a minute into playing. Then I will have to take it off and reset the device and repair it as a new device. So most of the time I keep it paired to only one device .. so it don't get jealous so to speak. Other times I will simply use the headphone jack, so that it won't shut itself off if idle. The sound quality is awesome though, so for that factor I can work with her a bit when she has her days. LOL",5,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
I was very happy with the sound of the Flip 4 however after a few months I noticed the battery life started to diminish considerably. The battery life would last approximately 30 to 45 minutes going from a full charge indictor light to a blinking red light and then shortly after shutting off. I had to resort to keeping the Flip 4 plugged in order to work. Two weeks ago while listening to music high frequency sounds would start to distort and after a 10 to 20 second period the speaker would automatically shut off. After turning the speaker on the same high frequency sound distortion would return shutting my Flip 4 off rendering it basically useless. It works on most occasions if I am listening to vocal commentary but if I am listening to music the same high distortion problem occurs. My Flip 4 warranty has expired and I attempted to have it fixed but the two repair centers JBL recommended told me they don't fix Flip 4s because its economically unfeasible to do so (e.g. $50 just to diagnose the problem on a unit I spent $80 new for).In spite of this mishap I have been a fan of JBL Speakers. I really enjoy the sound. Years ago I had a JBL Flip 2 that stopped working after a year. I believe I was to blame for that speaker since I unfortunately exposed it to moisture. I have a Charge 2 that stopped charging and would no longer work even when plugged into the wall. The Charge 2 was out of warranty so I couldn’t get it replaced. So having my third JBL speaker not work for me has proven to be a huge disappointment.,2,1,2019-5-2,1,0,0
"My mother has the JBL Xtreme 2 so I already knew and loved the brand. However, that one is way too big for me to have in a college dorm.

The music sounds so complete with this speaker and it’s the perfect portable size. 10/10!",5,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0
The speaker came quickly and I have been more amazed everytime I use it at the quality of the sound given the size and price.  It is by far my favorite portable now.  The battery life is excellent. A side plus is the all the extra stuff that you can buy ie. cases and carrying straps and other stuff.  I am tempted to buy another one given the current prices and color selection. Can't say enough good about JBL Flip 4.,5,1,2018-11-24,1,1,0
"Hands down one of my favorite purchases. $80 can be a loud number, but so is the speaker. It handles any bass boost flawlessly, and the sound carries a very good distance. The JBL link feature works wonderful when friends bring their speakers too, becauze the link system lets us have surround sound with no delay between speakers. Charge lasts a long, long time, even on full blast.I've taken this speaker across the country and on all kinds of excursions and it has performed without fault. I use it on runs, hikes, showers, snowboarding, parasailing, or even just to drown out someone else's music. I would recommend not letting it play music underwater (if you drop it in a pool or such) for very long as the water will leak into the power button. (Doesn't affect performance or get into the actual speaker, but takes a while for the water to evaporate out.)",5,1,2018-11-28,1,1,0
"I purchased the same product about 1.5 years ago but made the mistake of buying it refurbished to save a few bucks. The battery eventually wore down to holding less than an hour charge and before the first year was up I couldn't recharge it anymore so had to dump it. But, this same model is at such a great price I'm buying it new and love it! the sound is huge from this small speaker, it fits in a golf cart perfectly, holds a charge for about 7 hours so far at 100% use, and the price is great! I did my research and this is the best model unit for the sound and price. You won't be disappointed. And buy new, refurbs are a waste of money.",5,1,2018-8-22,1,1,0
A speaker is only as good as its battery life. This one is pathetically short especially when playing at loud volume (using it outdoor it HAS to be loud).

I bought another for my house.  I just hang it out on the patio when we're by the pool and you have no problem hearing them.  If you need more sound, you can link another to it.  When I know I'm going to have more people over, I just take the one from my office home and link it and set it on the other side of the patio.  This way everyone has music.  They're not as light as my other speaker, but I'm assuming it's due to the quality.  These sound 100 times better and fill the room.",5,1,2019-8-9,1,0,0
"This is the 4th small blutooth speaker I've owned and by far the best.  It blows the Oontz angle out of the water in terms of volume and bass.  This speaker works best in a smaller space without too much distance between it and the listener.  For it's size the bass is really great.  That said if you take it outside or into a large room it tends to feel a little tinny at high volumes, but for it's size I think it's the best in this category aside from maybe a bose.  Very happy. Definitely above average blutetooth speaker. Fine for bedroom listening. Bass is good. Terrible a tad tinny.",5,1,2019-4-23,1,0,0
"This JBL bluetooth speaker has really great sound for it's size.  I tried lying it down and standing it up and think the bass is a bit better standing up.  Also, the bluetooth connection range seems to be pretty good as I can move with my phone into another room in my house away from the speaker without any disruption to the sound.  And I would add that for the price it was a pretty good value.",5,1,2019-4-6,1,1,0
"The sound is really good. But the sound doesn't match up with the lips when you're using bluetooth... which is more of a bluetooth problem overall. If I had known I would've tried to get an RF wireless speaker.Also, the bass is so loud you have to turn it off to listen to movies. But it won't turn the bass off from the PC it has to be turned off from the speaker which requires you to hold the bluetooth and lower volume button at the same time for like 15-20 seconds. Which is a pain in the ass and something the instruction booklet didn't tell you about.",4,1,2018-9-27,1,0,0
"This isn't a bad speaker... While it looks nice and is water proof/resistant... It's a bit overpriced for what you get. You pay for that JBL name brand, really.  There are better, slightly larger speakers on the market with far more bass, that are also waterproof... for a lot less money.Because they're small, they fit well inside of a small camper or tent situation. They do get loud, as well. Battery life is nothing to be amazed by, it's average.",3,1,2018-8-2,1,1,0
"I got this after having a isound glow tower. The isound was very good for the $50 price, I wanted something louder and with longer battery life.

I love that it will pair with another flip4, saving up for another one! Great speaker for just under $100.",5,1,2018-10-18,1,1,0
"Freaking love this thing and take it everywhere. I'm a musician, so I really appreciate the well balanced and detailed sound for what this is. Portability is great, calls actually work well on it, battery lasts an entire day by the pool (can confirm waterproof status as far as it won't kill it, but don't expect it to sound good in water). It also feels really, really solid. Like you could definitely knock someone out with it.It's bassy enough for me, I've got a JL ported 8"" box in my truck if that tells you anything... I like balanced sound, not overpowering bass. I read entirely too many reviews of Bluetooth speakers in the range, and compared it to the UE Boom in best buy. Sound is somewhat subjective, but I found the UE sound to be a little thin in the midrange but had slightly more dynamic imaging in a room, but if you're using it outside I'm not sure that will show. The Flip 4 sounds fuller, warmer, while a bit more direct.",5,1,2017-6-19,1,1,0
Only had this product two days but it’s quite powerful.  It’s a great product BUTTTTT it came without a charging cord. Odd to receive a costly speaker without a charger cord.  Not sure of battery longevity.UPDATE:  have product now for a good week.  Again... no charger card came with product.  Thought I could get over that BUT the dern thing will not stay on.  Keeps shutting off.  Returning this 💩 Monday morning!,1,1,2019-6-19,1,1,0
"I just got it, and I already hooked it up to the Bluetooth and wow, it sounds great! It’s little smaller then I expected, but like the fact that it’s a little more compact. So far it’s only been a few minutes, and I love it!  Has some good weight to it, great sound, cool looking, and it’s waterproof, which is very cool. I bought the camouflage one. I can hide it in the bushes. Lol.I was just excited over my new Bluetooth speaker, I had to write home about it",5,1,2019-2-19,1,0,1
"Sounds fantastic!  An unexpected sound out of a small, little speaker.  It's also splash proof!  I could not ask for a better portable speaker.  Easily syncs to your devices Bluetooth and holds charge for several sittings of listening to music.  The volume is also controlled from your phone or device which is great because you do not have two different items you must control the volume on.  If your phone or device is on max volume, so is the speaker and vice versa.  Amazon also beat the price of other retailers.  I was going to buy the item at Wal-Mart.  Taxes and all was approximately $108.00.  Amazon beat the price significantly.  I am very impressed with this portable Bluetooth speaker.  Worth the investment if you like listening to music while sitting on the porch, backpacking, camping, working in the shop, and etc.",5,1,2018-3-13,1,0,0

Luckily we read our Amazon page and discovered that we had a 2 year warranty through our Amazon purchase.

I have had this product since January.  This is the 2nd speaker that has been sent.  I struggle bad with it just cutting off.  Unless completely connected to the charger as well as cutting off on the charger.  I am a yoga teacher and have been weary of using it in class.  But now starting to travel and teach more I would like to be able to take it with me wherever I go.  I do not trust the speaker at all.  People keep telling me that all Bluetooth speakers do that.  Tho Iv come across many teachers who are satisfied with the speaker they use.  This speaker has been unpredictable since day one.  Even after receiving the second one.  It really bums me out and I do not trust this to take with me and teach.  I would hate to dive people into a deep yoga/ music journey and the it just cuts off on me.,2,1,2019-10-7,1,0,0
"It's a JBL speaker - it's freaken good! What more can I say.Update: so I put it in my oven so that it maximizes the bass, kinda like the same thing as when you put your smartphone in a cup or bowl to increase the bass and loudness... Well anyway I forgot it in the oven and turned my oven to 400... 10 minutes later I go back to open my oven cuz I wanted to leave it open at 400 for the heat .. and there was my JBL baking.. poor thing. But the magic is that it STILL WORKS PERFECTLY :) It didn't even melt at all!! It was hot af but it's just fine!!",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
Had this for over a year and the battery life is just as great as the first day I got it. So worth the money. I take this everywhere with me. Haven’t tested out the waterproof-ness of it because I’m just not brave enough. I’ve been through so many speakers and they all lose battery life so quickly no matter the price. Gets pretty loud I’ve used this by the pool and the beach on vacations and it’s been loud enough. If youre outside and have a lot of people around you might need to snag another one and link it though,5,1,2019-10-26,1,0,0
"This product is superiority in itself!!!😎 If I could afford to buy three more I would as it has the ability to connect to multiple JBL Flip 4 Bluetooth speakers...

I use one in front of my TV as a sound bar... I do not have to have an actual soundbar to have surround sound quality with the JBL Flip 4...

"I have been happy with my gen 1 clip JBL speaker for about the last 7 years. I thought it was time to upgrade and I was looking around and saw the flip4. I pulled it out the box and instantly connected it to my iphone. The audio quality blew me away. With the 1 sub on each end and the units internal speakers, it really produced some great sounds from a unit that is not much bigger then your hand. I have to say I am excited to buy another one to create the surround sound feature. For under 100$ you really are paying for the best speaker technology has to offer. GReat buy!",5,1,2020-6-5,1,1,0
"Exceptional quality in design, build, and sound. This speaker feels like my Mercedes Benz.  I was shocked to find this level of quality in a sub-hundred dollar bluetooth speaker.

Nice touch.I’ve been using the box it came in to transport it inside my backpack until my daily use nylon case arrives.",5,1,2018-3-17,1,0,1
"I was debating buying a Bose Bluetooth speaker so I did a little research and found a review from someone who had a Bose Bluetooth as well as this JBL Flip 4. He actually rated this one higher, so I decided to give it a try. For almost half the cost, this little JBL bluetooth speaker kicks out some serious sound and some serious bass!! I live in an apartment complex and so I don't need a huge system and this little speaker is perfect! Not only is the sound amazing, the battery lasts for days and you can use it to make phone calls and it also links together with other flip 4s so you can have a true surround sound experience if you have more than one of these speakers. I would definitely recommend the speaker to anyone looking for an affordable yet high quality device",5,1,2018-9-10,1,0,0
"This is my second JBL flip 4.  They may have a battery life expectancy of 2-3 years.  I am a mobile fitness trainer and use mine like crazy.  After 2-3 years, I was only getting through 1-2 workouts before I needed to recharge the battery.  Whereas I can usually go several days on one charge.  This puts out great sound for an outdoor workout without being offensive to others at an area park not involved with the workout.  And waterproof is a great added bonus for trips to the beach or if the rain sets in",5,1,2020-5-28,1,1,0
"Never had any issues with any JBL product. This speaker has great sound quality for its size especially.  Very portable, easy to use. Battery life is fantastic!

Love it!!! I was looking for a good speaker this summer and especially for the pool. Came across the JBL flip 4 and made the right choice to buy it. Not only is it water proof but it has a great sound quality and battery life. I tested it on the pool submerging it and work perfectly fine after. I usually go a week without charging it and just charge on weekends when i need for the pool.

"This little speaker is a powerhouse. My neighbor was the one who'd mentioned it to me back in early summer of 2019. So, I bought it and am I ever thrilled. It sits in my bike basket or fits nicely in my water bottle holder frame when I am out on the trails. And trust me, people hear me coming long before they even see me at times. And what smiles it brings. I have brought it into the shower or bath. So soothing. Hang it from a cabinet knob in my kitchen for some cooking or cleaning music. Sits out on the deck while I groom my pooch to sounds from my Amazon music app. Goes out to the garden with me, too.  Give it a try. Guaranteed you will love having it around.",5,1,2020-1-3,1,0,0

It's especially frustrating because probably the most important part of the product -- how good it sounds -- is not something you can really evaluate until after you physically have it. So far so good, the packaging from JBL is impressive its self, great design. l havent tried to see how water proof lt is and probably want, but great to know lt is",5,1,2017-7-15,1,1,0
"At this time in my life I do not have internet in my house, I know what do I live in a cave? So I wanted to get a speaker that I can connect my phone too and play music since it is so quiet in my house.  The battery does last a while. I believe I had it playing for about 6 hours and had enough battery to continue to play. I think my phone died before the speaker did.One thing I did notice was when I had music on and then I would receive a phone call the speaker would make this weird noise. I would have to take my phone call off of Bluetooth mode.",4,1,2019-5-13,1,0,0
"I was looking for an outdoor waterproof speaker and had narrowed my choices down to this JBL, the UE Boom 2, or the UE Wonderboom. Based on online reviews, I thought I would likely get one of the UEs, but I went to a local electronics store where all three were on display to listen to them in person. I highly recommend doing that. I watched a bunch of review and comparison videos, but hearing the speakers through a video was nothing alike to hearing them in person. When I listened to both UE products, the audio sounded like it was coming from underwater. It was muffled and lacked clarity on the mids and high tones, but both UE speakers did have good bass. The JBL was incredibly clear and had a great range. In terms of audio quality, it's hard to compare the three speakers - the JBL was that much better. I haven't had the chance to run it from full charge until it dies to test the battery, but I've used it for several hours at a time over the past two weeks and have been happy with its performance. Bluetooth connection was easy and I like having the buttons on the speaker more than I thought I would. Overall, a fantastic speaker. Highly recommended.",5,1,2018-4-27,1,0,0

Also the plug has to be in the exact right spot for it to charge, if you bump it or jostle it in anyway, it stops charging. VERY frustrating.The Good:",3,1,2019-1-12,1,0,0
"The sound of this little speaker is amazing! I listen to Spotify all day connecting my phone with this speaker via Bluetooth (which was as easy as turning on the speaker and selecting the speaker on my Bluetooth devices in my phone) It fills my studio with music without trouble. It has enough power to raise the volume to unnecessary loud levels. I also tested it as a speakerphone and calls were very clear and people listened to me clearly as well. On the down side, the cable it comes with is short (mostly for recharging the speaker than keeping it plugged). It doesn't come with a carrying case although the box is pretty fancy and could be kept as a case. The user manual comes in so many languages that it's hard to figure out but since I had other Bluetooth speakers before I knew what to do.",5,1,2017-9-22,1,2,0
"I have an audio/video rental company and rent out a lot of JBL PRX and QSC equipment. Those are great for filling large venues. This little Flip 4 is great for personal use. This is perfect to bring along to the bedroom, kitchen, and hotel room. It gets plenty loud. It surprising has some deep end to it, but doesn't compare to something like a QSC K8 when it comes to lows. But that is OK because this wasn't meant to be used as a PA. Think of this as a premium personal speaker that you can throw in a bag. Bluetooth has been rock solid on my iPhone 8. The sound so far is warm compared to some cheaper smaller bluetooth speakers I've used. I really like the rubber push button to turn it on and off much better than the plastic toggle buttons used on other speakers. It feels more premium.",5,1,2018-2-8,1,0,0
"The best speaker I have ever purchased. It is so expensive and I am not the kind of person to spend $80 on a speaker, but this is definitely worth your money. The bass is powerful. It’s great for listening to music but no so much for, for example, watching movies. It is somewhat difficult to understand what people are saying through this speaker, but that’s not a big deal to me. I have dropped it a few times, taken it to the beach, held it with wet hands, and it is in great condition. After almost a year of having it, it is a definite upgrade from the JBL 3. After almost a year of use with the JBL 3, it crackled and made a rhythmic thumping sound after I raised the volume past a certain point. Would recommend this investment!",4,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0

Mine won’t even get 5hrs continuous play. So far it hasn’t been a problem bc I’m @ home enjoying it but if I ever take it somewhere not even getting half what’s promised might suck. Better take a battery pk with you or charging cable. Not going to last 12hrs. Still a good speaker but if it dying after less than half that times a problem you might look elsewhere.",3,1,2018-4-24,1,1,0
"I have no idea what happened but I bought these last May and they're about to completely stop working. The sound is not coming out clearly anymore; everytime there's even a small base in the song, the speakers sound like it's banging against a wall. Everytime I skip a song or even choose a song, it skips/scratches part of the song. I can't even remember the last time I've dropped it or the last time it's been around water; and even so they said it was waterproof. Only positive thing about this is that the battery life they advertise is pretty accurate.",3,1,2019-3-30,1,3,0

I'm interested in seeing what the larger model sounds like.  I still can't decide if I like the sea-foam green color.  One thing I wasn't expecting was that it doesn't put out sound in 360 degrees.

I recommend you get it. Now, the only things is, sometimes it can lack the depth of sound quality, specifically when I hear what I believe to be a trumpet 🎺 playing on a jazz song, it doesn't sit well with me coming from this type of speaker.

The pictures are from about a year of this use and abuse and there are barely any marks or dents.The volume carries so it’s great for parties and the work environment. It’s the perfect size, It fits just in my hand. I even strap it to my backpack when I run or hike and I only  the strap it comes with. This thing is built to last.",5,1,2020-8-2,1,0,1
"Purchased this speaker to play music when we’re entertaining guests on our deck or in the pool. Took it out of the box, tuned it on, connected it to my iPad, and played the first song I had on my playlist. Sound quality is AMAZING!! It’s not fully charged when it arrives so I can’t comment on the battery life. It’s sturdy, easy to figure out even without reading the instructions, and comes neatly packaged in a reusable magnetic box. I can’t wait to use it more!!",5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
This product is amazing. I wanted to upgrade from my last speaker the oontz angle 3 and I'm really happy with my decision! Immediately after trying it I could tell the difference in sound quality. There's way more bass and the sound is just better overall. I chose the red because I'm in the Christmas spirit and the vibrant color matches my decor perfectly. Can't wait to show off this speaker to people who visit for the holidays 🤩,5,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
"Either I got a defective product or they are lieing about the battery, even on full charge this product will last only a few hours ( not even close to 12 hours, is what is advertised on product description) I was going to buy two of them but what's the pointUPDATE: the speaker won't even charge while playing,when I connect the speaker on the charger when I see a single red blinking light ( meaning the speaker is critically low on battery) it will only chrage up to only one solid white battery indicator.",3,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"I have been wanting a JBL Flip speaker since June of last year, but couldn't bring myself to spend $120 on something for just me. But once i saw that the price lowered to $80, i couldn't pass it up!! And i'm so glad i chose this over the new BOSE speaker. I have an older BOSE speaker that was purchased in 2013, and this is just as good if not better. Especially considering it's water proof, and smaller in size than my BOSE. I've already recommended this to my friends as well as family members! Can't wait to purchase a second one.",5,1,2018-3-7,1,1,0
"(tldr at the bottom)Before I purchased this speaker I was using a UE Boom, most likely a first generation model. It was nice, and did what I needed it to. But it was getting old and the battery life was non-existent. So! I hopped on Amazon and found this speaker on sale, and I thought why not. When it came in I was very surprised at the overall quality. I've also had a Nose Mini SoundLink Gen 1, and I compare almost all portable speakers to that. This doesn't quite come close to the Bose, but that's okay! This isn't in the same category. For the price, you get an awesome, little speaker that kicks some nice bass (the sides move like a subwoofer!), it has a solid weight to it for a small speaker so it feels premium (which is important for some people), and the connection to your phone along with controlling the speaker is seamless. It has a little rope for attaching it to something, and a rubber cover for the charging port. I haven't tested the water resistance/proofness of the speaker, but it's fine so far after being in the bathroom when I shower!",5,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
"Don't order this product from any other seller or website. I made that mistake the first time and spent too much on a shoddy knockoff. This one is the real deal and the difference in audio quality and build is obvious. I bring this to work with me on delivery days and my coworkers adore having this speaker around. I like my music loud and it's the perfect combination of volume and portability. The battery tends to run down quickly, like in a couple hours when it's on full volume, but turning it down a bit can conserve the battery life, or I just bring a charger with me. Worth every penny for the joy of music.",5,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0
"Like others, mine has had battery issues and now does not hold a charge at all. I’ve had it about 14 months and use it almost every day so maybe it isn’t made to last with this amount of use. Something to keep in mind. For $80.00 I think it should have lasted much longer. I wouldn’t buy it again.",2,1,2020-7-30,1,1,0
"The speaker sounds great, has solid lows mids and highs for a speaker of it's size. Two complaints:1. The ""bass radiator"" things on the ends are mostly a gimmick but are a huge trap for sand and dirt. Would have been better with a speaker cap over the ends to keep debris out.",4,1,2018-8-24,1,1,0

"The sound is great!  The two-device system is flawed however.  If my wife is using the speaker, and I am in the house and get a text message, then my phone overrides hers on the speaker.  So one of the phones has to be totally disconnected from the speaker or you end up with a battle of phones.And it doesn't have to be that way.  I have a set of inexpensive bluetooth headphones that handles two devices flawlessly - on those headphones 2 devices can be paired to it at once, and the 2nd NEVER overrides the first.  If I stop the music on the first device, then sound from second can come through.",4,1,2018-4-14,1,0,0

"Bought for my daughter. She dropped it in the tub when taking a bath one day. Still works. Has pretty good sound with good bass. Daughter loves the mint color of this one. Plan on getting her the carry case for it soon. Only one thing I can say is iffy. My daughter knocked it off her table (yes she's a bit clumsy) while it was plugged in and the charge cable broke. These use pretty standard cables so we were able to find another one that charges. Overall though, pleased with the quality of this speaker. Trusted brand. Would buy another one.",5,1,2017-12-29,1,1,0
Nice little speaker when it would stay connected.. bought it for a party and it continuously dropped the Bluetooth connection... down loaded the app for it and that was just a waste of time... tried resetting using the + & > buttons ... tried and he power button reset trick too.... nothing worked... it's a real disappointment... going back,1,1,2017-7-23,1,2,0
"It’s a very easy to use Bluetooth speaker and I’ve been using it for a week now almost everyday. It’s high quality and loud one (not super loud but good enough), connects quickly to my phone. Updating its firmware took 30mins but I don’t mind cause you don’t need to update it regularly. Enables you to talk through it and you can also connect it to another JBL speaker and sync them to play at the same time. Overall 5/5",5,1,2020-8-7,1,1,0
We've had this speaker for about a year and a half. Recently the speaker would shut off randomly and make a terrible scratchy noise without warning until it ultimately again shut off.  I contacted jbl about the 1 year warranty and they provided us a few steps that we already tried to remedy this. It's frustrating they wouldn't replace this(I know it's out of the warranty)  because it was never abused or used to its extent and was exclusively used inside in our kitchen. Disappointing and we wont purchase another jbl product. Should have just went with a bose.,2,1,2020-4-14,1,1,0
"I was using this for watching movies in my RV. Sounds great, however lower levels of the movie the audio would cut out. Then when dialog came back the first couple words the audio would be off.There are some ""fixes"" but they didn't work for me. So if you are planning on watching movies/tv audio I'd say pass. You'll be disappointed.  If listening to music like most, then it's great for the price!",4,1,2020-8-12,1,0,0
Sooo this thing is pretty much still brand new but I figured I would drop a quick review.  Over all it seems like it will serve its purpose.  Sound quality is ok as long as you don't turn it all the way up.  Bass is ehhh ok.  I have had several better quality speakers for the same price.  Overall not bad but I would not get another one.  As for battery life or how long this thing is going to last I can't say yet.  The blue tooth connectivity is good.,3,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0
"Admittedly, it has been several years since I’ve purchased a Bluetooth speaker so I’m not up to date with the product space.  I currently have several rooms in our house and garage connected to apple air ports with amplified speakers.  However, I needed something that I could use by our kiddy pool in the back yard so I purchased this speaker.  I am so completely impressed with the quality, sound resolution and portability of this speaker that I’m rethinking my entire house setup.  I almost can’t believe the amount of fidelity and bass response of this tiny speaker.  I typically don’t write product reviews but felt compelled to give credit to JBL for this product.",5,1,2018-7-21,1,1,0
These Flip 4 speakers are hard to beat for the price. I have bought one for just about every family member. When we get together it is nice to be able to link all the speakers together. Sound it good. Battery life is outstanding. Had two computers setup with one having a 5 speaker setup and I didn't want to disconnect that and put in on the other computer. I had a bluetooth dongle and used that to connect this speaker to the computer. Problem solved.,5,1,2019-6-26,1,0,0
"First I want to say, this speaker WAS phenomenal to me. It sounds great and is practically indestructible.After a couple months in started to not charge as well. It'd take a fairly long time to charge something that only lasted 6 hours. Then it started to only charge when the wire was in a certain way. I think the rubber lid that covers the USB port applies too much pressure to the USB wire while plugged in that it damaged the port on the device after a little while.",2,1,2019-8-10,1,0,0
"Awesome speaker!! Has awesome sound quality, as well as is pretty loud too, and i love that its waterproof! I got this for my rooftop patio bc my previous jawbone speaker was finally crapping out on me and didnt have good sound quality any longer or held a charge... but this new one is awesome I accidentally forgot to grab it the other night when it suddenly started down pouring and for sitting in the rain for 20-30 mins still works awesome and sound quality still awesome!!!!",5,1,2020-6-28,1,0,1
"I waited a month to write this review due to all the negative reviews about it working for a little while then dying, or breaking. Iv used JBL products for a long time and they NEVER let me down!

"I utilize this speaker in my studio suite that is 135 Square Feet - It gives beautiful sound that isn't weak/echoey as some Bluetooth speakers can be.  The sound is rich and full, it also connects quickly and stays connected all throughout the day with ease.  I love that it can be portable, or stay connected to its power source for use!  I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a great bluetooth speaker with beautiful sound power!",5,1,2020-2-13,1,0,0
"Paired up with a Charge 3 is the ticket, this little speaker cleans it right up for an unreal sound with the deeper base of the Charge 3. Stand alone this little speaker can handle its own nicely and actually a little cleaner than the Charge 3 at lower volumes with plenty of base, paired up you get an unreal experience. I actually like this little speaker on its own better than the Charge 3 in smaller rooms, but the three stands out in larger rooms at medium volume😊",5,1,2019-6-18,1,0,0

Can't speak to long use on battery power as use it mostly plugged in when home. Connects easily to Bluetooth and can plug in a device to play without Bluetooth if you like. All-in-all a great speaker and not too expensive for the great sound!",5,1,2019-7-14,1,0,0
"This SHOULD be 5 stars across the board considering it's the size of a pop can and sounds pretty darn good. Not just for the size but good......period. I have one hell of a home theater and while this is nothing compared to that, it sounds as good as a nice 2.1 computer speaker set up BUT not near field. You have to be about 10 ft away from this baby to appreciate it and believe me you WILL. For 75 bucks I can't believe it.",4,1,2019-8-7,1,0,0
"This is the best blue tooth speaker I’ve had. It’s my forth try. What I love is that it connects every time, I never have to fight with it like I did with the bose.  I was a little tossed up about the sound quality, this has more percussion than the bose but the bose has a fuller mid-range. I decided to go for the percussion because it works & for exercise percussion may be more important anyway. I sure wish I could marry the 2 for sound purposes.",4,1,2020-1-29,1,0,0
Battery Life sucks. This speaker doesn’t last 6 hours without being totally dead. This is the second one I’ve purchased and both are the same. If I want to have it running all day I need to have it plugged it... so it kind of defeats the purpose of it being portable.I have 3 cheapo $29.99 Bluetooth portable speakers and they can last 5-7 days even running them 6-8 hours per day.,1,1,2018-6-18,1,3,0
"The JBL Flip 4 is a GREAT speaker!  The sound quality is awesome.  My kids love to take it in the shower so they can switch songs (still scares me a bit, but they do it and it keeps working).  The speaker is sturdy and tough.  It has a nice strap to carry it.  The range is great!  My son listens to stories from my phone.  I can keep my phone with me downstairs while he goes upstairs to listen and play legos.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0
"Honestly I bought this as a Christmas gift for my partner and I was so jealous 😂 The sound on this speaker is so powerful! I love the vibrant red although I wanted the black one.. it’s portable, charges quickly and connects with all tablets computer and phones easily. This was one of the best speakers I’ve ever purchased.. it’s definitely worth every penny! I would advise getting a case for it especially if you work in a hands on field. It can get dirty, and it’s not a good look on the bright red. Otherwise it’s amazing! JBL is the best!",5,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0
"This is our third flip we have purchased (one 3 and two 4's). The sound on these are incredible. I wish the 3's and 4's were compatible, but I knew that when I bought them. The stereo sound on two 4's together is fantastic. Better than a older Bose speaker we have. I hope all my neighbors buy these so we can amp-up any party with connecting sound.",4,1,2018-1-4,1,2,0
Sound is great up until the top 10% of the volume which then gets a tad bit distorted. I do not hate on it for this though seeing as it is relatively small and still manages to sound really good even at 100%. At ~50% volume the battery lasts for 8+ hours in my experience. I have tested the waterproofing out by bringing it into the shower with me for some shower sing alongs and so far no issues. My favorite thing about it though is the Bluetooth range. It is so much better than some of the other speakers I have owned in the past. I can set it down and go anywhere in the house without any issues.,5,1,2018-8-3,1,0,0
"Great sound and size for the Flip 4.  I just bought it and have been using it at the beach all week.  I love that you can hang it, under the beach umbrella for instance.  Just need to pick up a caribiner to clip to stuff.  I was impressed with the sound from the time I turned it on.  Easy to pair with my iPhone and stream any music service I have.  I was debating between the Charge 3 and Flip 4.  I'm glad I picked the Flip because of the more compact size.  I'm sure the Charge is great and likely improved sound due to larger size, but I like this one being a little smaller.",5,1,2017-7-18,1,1,0
"The connectivity of these speakers is awesome. The range is much farther than my JBL3. However, The JBL 3 sounds MUCH better than the JBL 4. The sound is crackly and definitely not as crisp and clear as my JBL 3. Very disappointed. I'm using them for surround sound for a house party, and was really hoping that the sound quality would be as good as the JBL 3. Also, the JBL 4 will not allow my JBL 3 to connect to it for ""party mode"". Boooooooooo......",3,1,2019-8-14,1,0,0
The sound quality of this speaker is comparable to my home wired surround sound. Talk about clarity and high bass. I have this speaker in my office and have received compliments on both its looks and the sound. There is no distortion whether it is turned down low or turned up high and blasting. Bluetooth speakers have came a long way in the way they sound. You cannot go wrong with these speakers at all.**UPDATE**. My iPhone 6+ does not automatically pickup this speaker. I am hoping that Apple and JBL soon has a fix as this gets pretty annoying that whenever you get out of range of the speaker you have to go back and re select it.,5,1,2017-6-24,1,1,0
This is a nice blutooth speaker don't really see a difference from JBL flip 3. Only thing which is different is it has JBL connect plus instead of JBL connect. Which makes this device the odd one out. I don't understand why JBL has done this. Now that all of my friends having a JBL connect I am unable to join in. I think JBL should give an update for all the newly launched products otherwise JBL flip 4 will just be stand alone device.,4,1,2019-11-28,1,1,0

"I purchased the Flip 4 in January of 2018.  I have been very happy with it until recently when the battery life decreased dramatically.  I will not hold a charge for even 2 hours now which makes it pretty useless.  I have seen numerous other complaints about this same issue in various places online.  Since there does not appear to be an easy way to replace the battery this speaker is, like most electronic devices now, essentially made to be disposable.  I would not recommend this speaker for this reason.",2,1,2019-11-13,1,1,0
I bought the flip 4 because i was impressed with my brothers flip 3 . It connected with my phone easily has great sound . i am an audiophile and i still can not figure out how JBL gets such great sound out of a cylinder. I believe it has a class D amplifier in it.  I had it setting on a ledge in my bath tub and it rolled and fell in the water . I pulled it out dried it off and it works perfectly . the cylindrical shape makes it prone to rolling. Standing it up straight improves the bass but limits sound stage. plan on buying another one and connecting them .,5,1,2018-10-26,1,0,0
"This is great speaker. Perfect size, not too big not to small - just accurate in my opinion. It is waterproof what is big upgrade versus JBL Flip 3 which was just splash proof. Sound is clear with just right amount of bass. It also have voice assistant integration feature. Very easy to pair with your phone and if you have more then one (or some of your friends brought another one) you can connect them together for even better music experience. It comes in 9 different colors you can chose from. I highly recommend it, not only to take your music with you wherever you go but also for listing at home. Total worth money I have spend on it.",5,1,2018-12-29,1,0,0
"Very impressed with the sound.  I was on the fence about whether to get this or the Charge 3.  Video reviews of the sound seemed accurate in that the Charge 3 delivers better bass but is otherwise murky.  And even though I like full sound with bass, I think the Flip 4 is the better option for music lovers who value tones.  I'd say the bass out of this is ""enough"" to satisfy.  It's also smaller and more portable, which I like.  If I travel, it won't take up much room in a suitcase.The BT range is very good, as expected. It pairs easily.  I like that the sound is very good no matter how you place or stand it. Battery life seems excellent though I haven't run it for more than a couple of hours at a time. I haven't tested its water handling abilities (and probably won't, it wasn't a factor in my decision)",4,1,2018-3-8,1,1,0
"I really like the look of the speaker and the sound is really good! It connects to the bluetooth, in my laptop, every single time. I bought a few of them.

Occasionally, they will stay connected for a little while but most of the time they don't. But as I said, the sound is really good.",5,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
Excellent sound for a small lightweight speaker.

Otherwise, I am happy with this brand and this item.",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"I really love this speaker. It is relativly light and has an easy transportable size. There is a handy string connected to the back which can be used to hang up the speaker. Charges quickly (about an hour for fully charged) and lasts for a while depending on what volume you keep it set at. The sound quality is really really great and its actually kind of fun to watch the bass vibrating on either side of the speaker which does not distort the sound at all. The packaging was simple and easy to open. I have not tested if it is waterproof yet. One small point is that the speaker and inner packaging was sort of warm upon arrival, almost like the battery had heated it up. This may have been related to the delivery but worth mentioning. I 100% would recommend this speaker to anybody who needs a light durable bluetooth great quality sound system. Love this speaker.",5,1,2018-8-28,1,1,0

Like stated in the product description the battery life is phenomenal. I generally don't listen on more than half volume and I'll go weeks without charging. The design is sleek and functional, and its small size means you can bring it everywhere and put it anywhere. The sound is very good in all varieties of of music, I listen to rap, country, rock, jazz, big band, choir, really anything sounds great.

It blows my mind how the engineers at JBL achieved this. The bass hits hard and deep and mids are clean and crisp. The gigantic cherry on top is how small and portable it is.

Well she listens to Motown when she does her daily workouts and she decided to crane up the sound. This little speaker even sounds good when the volume is all the way up. Another plus is the ability to hold a charge and it's waterproof. We took this out on our canoe and it was playing for over 4 hours, that evening I listen to it for another 5 hours and it was still going strong.",5,1,2018-11-27,1,0,0
"I have a JBL charge 2 that i got 4 years ago, and its battery isn't lasting like it used to, so my husband surprised me with this speaker for Christmas and i was apprehensive at first. I am really blown away by my how great this speaker was compared to my charge 2. The only thing i would change is didnt include a wall adapter to the charging cord. So its stuck with USB only.  The sound quality is amazing and i didnt have to blast it (i like loud music) and my beloved charge 2 now sits in retirement on the shelf",5,1,2019-1-4,1,0,0
"I ordered 2, but one is malfunctioning - less than a week after the return window.  I have only used them a handful of times, and as I used them, one started to make crackling noises.  At first, it was just after it connected to my phone and the other speaker.  Just a slight crackling for a second or two.  My last use, it crackled more than it didn’t, even drowning out the other speaker.  Very disappointed.",2,1,2019-7-1,1,0,0
It never fails... This was my best new little friend.  It packed amazing sound and it was so small until on day the stupid thing decided never to turn on again.  hate wasting money and I knew I should have just gone to best buy but I took a chance.  I was reluctant to trash it but after 5 days I couldn't get it to come back on.  That's the only problem with buying electronics on Amazon...They can stop working after your 30 days return window is over.,1,1,2019-2-8,1,1,0
"The Flip 4s are great for using them in multiple rooms or outside. I was contemplating the purchase of a flip 5 but the flip 5 is not compatible with the flip 4 in a multi-speaker environment. Sorry JBL, you messed up  here.",5,1,2020-1-15,1,1,0
Pretty decent speaker except...  something may be wrong with the speaker's battery and charge that it can hold.I was really enjoying the bluetooth feature until the speaker cannot hold the charge for more than 10-15 minutes.,2,1,2018-5-30,1,0,0
"Bought this speaker about a month ago, been using it daily since then.. After walking into multiple stores I concluded that this was the best BT speaker for the price and I've been really happy with my decision!I take this bad boy everywhere, in the shower, kitchen while I'm cooking.. I love how small and light it is, bought a case for 10$ and it's perfect. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a portable speaker in the 80-90$ price range as this speaker is easily better quality than most of the 130$+ portables out there. 10/10 no complaints yet!",5,1,2018-9-18,1,0,0
"I bought this speaker February 8, 2018. It sounded great, but a week ago it stopped taking a charge. I have tried all kinds of things, and tested all the possible USB chargers to make sure that it was not the chargers. The unit just does not charge at all. Very dissappointed and surprised for this product to have failed because it is made by JBL, but apparently several other reviewers have exprerienced the same problem. I would not recommend buying this until jBL resolves the problem.",1,1,2019-6-21,1,1,0
"Very upsetting that this speaker purchased for a Christmas gift 7 months ago is now non functional.  All of a sudden the volume buttons don't work on the speaker, and have a mind of their own, changing volume on their whim.  Son is extremely upset.",1,1,2020-7-16,1,1,0
"This speaker is awesome. It's my first JBL and I've had it for over a month now. Battery life is great, the sound is great even with heavy base. Music has a nice full sound and it can get very loud. I also  listen to a lot of audio books and this speaker makes it much easier to hear while moving from room to room and voices are not distorted. I love that there is the potential to sync with other JBL speakers.My one con isn't even a serious one. I don't think it has the connection range that I heard claimed on some YouTube reviews. I took my phone across the house (I live in small home so it wasn't that far) and the speaker cut out a bit.",5,1,2018-9-8,1,0,0
"Nice contact portable Bluetooth speaker. Apparently, you can pair it with other compatible jbl speaker to extend the range.I was disappointed that it doesn't have a good way to stand it. It doesn't really game a base. It's completely round. I've been standing on its end which is cantilevered and doesn't stand perpendicular. The bass drivers are out the ends of the tube so standing it this way drives the bass into the shelf and the other end into open air.",4,1,2020-1-10,1,0,0
"This is my second one of these devices, and they both perform exceptionally well. I have one for my office and one for travel purposes. The sound is rich and clear, and the Bluetooth connectivity is perfect. You’ll be amazed at the quality of sound one can get from these small speakers. They are amazing. Plus, the charge lasts a long time, and charging is easy with the USB plug in.",5,1,2020-1-6,1,0,0
"Should have written a review of this months ago. I bought this because it was water proof and I like to have it with me on the golf course. It is well made and tough and the sound quality and amplification is great. Fits in the cup holder of a golf cart. Battery lasts at least 5 hours with conituing play. I liked the one I bought for my golf bag so much I bought another one for my office. My friends like it so much 5 of them have bought one for themselves. JBL has always been recognized as a quality speaker manufacture, this lives up to the legend. As good as a Bose mini ant less than half the price. You will not be disappointed.",5,1,2018-11-18,1,0,0
"If I can give this piece of garbage zero stars I absolutely would! I came back home today to my package, I had ordered a JBL flip 4 color teal and received a black jbl which was fine, I actually didn’t mind the color after wards. However, the more and more I messed with it the speaker looked USED! It had stains and did not look brand new!!! Not only was the speaker horrible but it did not even come with the right charger! Looks like someone just replaced it with the original speaker and just threw it in the box along with a dirty charger. I will definitely be requesting for a refund. This is just freaking ridiculous.",1,1,2019-3-14,1,2,1
Tried 2 other speakers and found them wanting especially as regards sound quality.  Bought this 6 months ago and am still surprised at the sound quality and long battery life.  It's not going to handle the needs of a wedding reception but it's plenty powerful enough for a porch full of people.  Remarkable and clear bass even at low levels.  It's just a really good wireless speaker and well worth the money.,5,1,2019-6-28,1,0,0
"During a Kayaking trip with some friends i tied this off to the bow lashings so i could paddle and listen to music. until i flipped the kayak and all my gear was submerged for at least 10 minutes. and when i finally righted the boat, the speaker was STILL PLAYING. I'm blown away at how wel the design prevents water damage, the sound quality is just what you'd expect if not more. just use the charger it comes with, or the microUSB's from Amazon Basics, and you'll enjoy this product for years.",5,1,2018-7-10,1,0,0
"I wanted a Bose speaker, but the waterproof version did not stand up to the Bose sound standard in my opinion. This JBL Flip 4 isn't up to the Bose sound standard either, but is not only adequate for the intended use, but better sounding than the waterproof Bose speaker. Easy to use and carry. Quick to connect to bluetooth. I really like how well it works with my phone. Long battery life.",5,1,2019-4-12,1,0,0
"I love it!  I used to have a portable Bluetooth speaker and it died.  I saw a close friend had this.. and it got really loud, really quickly..and still had a pristine sound.  I didn't think about it at the time, but when mine died, I asked him about it.. and he suggested I get it.  I absolutely love mine.  Easily transportable, waterproof - which is great because I'm constantly near the water, and the sound is unbeatable.  Great purchase!",5,1,2017-11-6,1,1,0
"I always wanted speakers for better sound and volume for parties. I went for this one because it is louder and wireless as compared to Google Home mini. Also a much better base as compared to google home mini. I was for some reason experiencing audio delay in google home mini and i don't in these speakers maybe because of bluetooth versions. Honestly I love the product, giving it 4 because I wish these were little bit cheaper.",4,1,2018-11-30,1,1,0
"Wonderful little speaker. I wasn’t intending on buying but when cyber Monday came around the price was so good for this little speaker, I had to go for it. It came as promised, I had heard the sound of this speaker before and was very pleased. It fills a room very nicely, I had also bought a bike mount and will use it come spring time. Of the price comes backs down again I’ll pick up a second cause the speaker has a party mode to link many of them together.",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,0
"Excellent! So far so good. Deeper bass notes a low to 80% volume. But, unfortunately like the original Flip 3. It decreases bass response as volume is turned up to maximum...But, overall very good. Will update regarding longevity as time goes on...As for the seller. Item was delivered in a timely manner, and in good order...",5,1,2017-5-10,1,3,0
"Was hesitant to purchase this speaker as I appreciate sound quality over loudness and tend to not be a bandwagon fan. I own several speakers from budget friendly to high end (audiophile). I can say that this little speaker impressed me with it's portability and decent audio. (Not the best, and above average in the mids and highs, Bass was good.) Overall satisfied and do recommend. I am a fan of Sony and chose this one over the SRS-XB20.",4,1,2018-1-11,1,2,1
These speakers are awesome. I usually listen to them for 10-20 mi utes in the morning and while i shower at night. I can get at least 8-10 days out of them on a charge with that routine.  Purchased two and setting them up for the right and left speaker stereo use is a breeze with the JBL app. The JBL app does take up quite a bit of space....but that's my only complaint with that side of things. These speakers look and feel of great quality and the sound itself is exceptional. Definitely better than I expected in all aspects.,5,1,2018-4-10,1,0,0
"I bought this speaker twice now. One for myself, and most recently as a gift. it is well loved!Primarily use it on our kayaks or by the pool. the splashproof feature is what sold me on it.",5,1,2020-9-16,1,1,0
"I’m very happy with this little speaker. If money was no object then I probably would have gotten a Bose, which would have been a mistake. Bose is great, but for a fraction of the price this JBL has great sound with surprisingly good bass. And the fact that it costs a lot less makes me less afraid to take it to the beach or park or camping; I don’t think I’d do that with a $300+ Bose speaker.",5,1,2018-5-20,1,1,0
"It worked for about 5 minutes then turn off. So I charged it. Now it won’t turn on at all. I looked on the internet and found that if you plug it in and immediately unplug it the power will come back on, however now it won’t connect, and the only way to turn off the power is to plug it in and unplug it right away. There were several complaints of the same thing when I looked it up.",1,1,2019-1-2,1,1,0
"This speaker is amazing!!! When I first saw the Flip 4, I never thought that it would deliver such a powerful, rich sound. I knew that it would be pretty good when I ordered it, but I never thought that it would be as good as it actually is. This speaker is most powerful with midrange and lower sounds. It delivers smooth, deep bass. The higher sounds can be a little tinny when at full volume, but normally having it at half or even 1/4 volume is plenty enough to be heard across multiple rooms. The waterproof aspect is a nice touch too, I haven't submerged it yet, but it has been through some steam, and can be used as a shower stereo. The charging port and auxiliary connection jack are sealed away nicely with a seemingly water-tight rubber flap (again, I have not yet submerged it, so I am not 100% sure on any of the water proofing features).  The Bluetooth is fairly average, but it connects quickly with my outdated android. Overall, this is a great speaker for an even better price.",5,1,2018-8-25,1,0,0
"First of all the sounds great but all that is pointless when you have instructions that are about 15% in English . No lie i thought it was a different book for Spanish & Japanese customers. Theres no way of finding hes dead. No way of starting up, troubleshooting & general descriptions . I was in awe. But my question is why do i hear loud thumps from inside speaker when its turned up real loud & you lower or increase volume !",4,1,2019-12-26,1,0,1
"I love the JBL Flip 4 because it provides incredible sound quality in a small, compact package at a far lower price than competing models from companies like Bose. I have one Flip 4 in the corner of my kitchen, and it puts out great, powerful sound. I also love the JBL Connect + feature because it just works and it works well to link multiple speakers together with no issues. Finally, the Flip 4 looks and feels like a far more expensive product compared to the terrific prices it sells for here on Amazon.",5,1,2018-9-3,1,0,0
"Got this speaker less than a year ago. I work in a truck 10 hours a day 5 days a week, there’s no radio so I bring this to use daily. Initially I was very pleased, great sound quality. The first thing I didn’t like very much was the battery life. They exaggerate heavily on what your actually going to get out of it when your listening to it at a decent volume. I was able to overlook this due to the great sound. Ok so nine months later this thing does not hold a charge at all, I can charge it fully and it will be dead in a matter of 30 mins. Just horrendous battery life not even usable less than a year after the purchase. If you want a speaker that’s actually going to last you look elsewhere",2,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0
I spent quite a bit of time researching different Bluetooth speakers before settling on the the one I wanted. The best & most thorough reviews I've seen are by JimsReviewRoom on YouTube. The guy knows his stuff and it's apparent that he spends countless hours going over each and every detail of the products he reviews and what they're best suited for. I watched every Bluetooth speaker review he has so I was in doubt when I chose the Flip4 and I love it!,5,1,2019-5-22,1,0,0
"I LOVE this little guy. My cousins have the black one and we're always borrowing it but I needed one of my own for beach/fishing trip days... Naturally, I googled what the best bluetooth speakers were out right now and the JBL Flip 4 was listed. I was thrilled when I came across a camo version!! I haven't fully submerged it into water, and I don't suggest anyone does that lol, but it held up just fine through rain on the boat for several hours. Can't say much about the battery life yet, no issues so far.",5,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0
"I convinced myself to buy a cheaper bluetooth speaker but decided to splurge on the flip 4 and I'm very happy I did.  I know cheap speakers have come a long ways, but this guy sounds excellent for its size, is water resistant and tough.  I've dropped it a bunch, its gotten rained on and it keeps on going.  Good battery life overall and the bass response is surprising for its size.  Overall I think its a great speaker and I'm super happy I invested a little more than I was planning in it.",5,1,2017-7-20,1,1,0
"This speaker is the best! It links to the Bluetooth device super quick and easy, waterproof, really durable and very high quality sound. The sound is by far the best quality I've seen from any portable speaker, another cool feature is they will link to other Flips so if you have a friend with one or you buy another one it will all link together and play! It's a no brainer if you're on the fence, I spent weeks researching and I'm glad i decided on this speaker. Hope this helps, Cheers",5,1,2018-9-18,1,0,0
this is by far one of the most flawless pieces of technology i’ve ever bought. i love this thing. i’m coming back to this page a year after i bought it to remark on how good of a product it is. just a delight to use. bravo to the people who built it. sounds incredible. the side woofers are amazing. so portable. the industrial design is slick. every part of it feels like quality. they really nailed it. the only regret with this thing is when i don’t have it with me,5,1,2020-7-24,1,1,0
"Ordered this and arrived on time.  Battery would not hold charge.  Called Amazon and they connected me with the company and sent it in for replacement.  Replacement was defective too, as the 5 light indicators for charge would not all light-up.  Only 4 lights would be on.  I think the problem was the defective light.  Everything else worked fine though.  Sent that in and waiting for another to be sent, hopefully this one is not defective.  I moved away from Bose as more and more of their products failed me and they were incredibly stingy with replacement and so far quality is failing me with JBL.",2,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0
"I bought this speaker through the seller REFERENCE HK LIMITED - It was close to a year ago now and I don't have any of the original packaging, but thinking of it I'm not sure that it was shipped in manufacturer packaging. I bought it as a replacement for another JBL speaker (the clip 2) and was surprised that it seemed to me that it had slightly lower quality, but i wasnt feeling picky. Just now, I was having connectivity issues with the micro usb charging port, and decided to open it up to see if i could throw in a replacement. I peeled back the grille and first of all, this is clearly not a waterproof speaker. Second, After doing some research, I cannot find any other jbl speakers that have similar structure to this one. I know that slightly different products are shipped to different countries sometimes, but this looks completely different than anything that I can find online",1,1,2019-12-2,1,0,0
"Love this speaker. I’m not a speaker enthusiast. If you want something that is clear and has good volume output, get this. I use it for when I’m cleaning around the house, cooking, or working outside in the yard or on my vehicle. Holds a charge well and lasts decently long depending on how loud you play music. I have not tested out the waterproof feature other than it was outside during a light rain. Do not get white unless you feel like you can keep it clean and grease free. That was my only mistake.",5,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
"Love this speaker, the sound is crisp and loud! I purchased the white one (Bad idea, as it gets dirty easily) but regardless of that, the sound is great, battery life is surprisingly long! I bought to use it later this year while I am on my honeymoon, so, I have no yet tested its resistance with water, even though I will be kept at a chair while at the beach. So far, I enjoy this product, i definitely recommend it.",5,1,2018-6-2,1,1,0
"For a device about the size of a 16 oz beer can, this has very good sound.  Is it a replacement for high quality speakers as some have said? Not even close!  But I don't think it is reasonable to expect that from a device of this size.  Part of my reason for selecting this particular model was for use as a hand free speaker when I work in remote, mobile offices.  This thing excels in that role.  With a group of people in the room, 8-10' away, they can speak in a normal voice and is very clear to the person on the other end.  It also does a good job of canceling back ground noise.",4,1,2019-1-20,1,0,0

"I love the JBL Flip. This is my second Flip 4, the first one rattled after a hard fall, so I decided to get this to replace it. The speaker sounds great, and when they are new the battery life is good; however, this speaker was barely over a year old when the battery started to not hold a charge any longer. It would show that it was fully charged, but after about an hour of use it would die. It’s obviously an issue with the battery. I went ahead and just bought another one, but I feel like they should last longer.",4,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0

"I bought a Flip 4 speaker about a year ago, and was delighted with the sound quality.  So a couple of months ago I bought another Flip 4 speaker so that I could listen via stereo.  The JBL literature advertised that you could connect up to 100 speakers from the same source or use 2 speakers in stereo mode.  After spending a few hours experimenting and talking to customer service, I was finally told that stereo mode ONLY works via the mobile app.  Stereo mode does NOT work via a MacBook Pro.  If you are only interested in using one speaker in mono mode, this is a good product.  However, if you want to use this product in stereo via your computer--it will NOT work.  JBL's reputation just took a huge drop in my eyes.",2,1,2019-4-26,1,0,0
"The speaker is excellent. I used two, paired in stereo, with a Fire tv. First I tried connecting one speaker to the tv by Bluetooth and then linked the two speakers using JBL Connect app. This resulted in intermittent static which went away when I connected the first Flip to the tv with a cable. I then connected the 2nd Flip to the 1st with JBL Connect app. This cleared the static but the app isn’t reliable. It switches off stereo sound without warning. If you are buying one it’s a good product. If you are hoping for reliable stereo (which is excellent when functioning) there must be a better product. I returned mine. Great hardware is undermined by JBL’s unreliable  software.",5,1,2019-2-19,1,0,0

It is definitely waterproof 😊 🤪 lol the only reason I took a star off is because I thought it would be louder...it is decent I just excepted a little bit more from JBL on this one...still great buy though. The battery lasted me all day playing tunes...at least 4-5 hours straight. When water gets in it, you go need to shake out the droplets because it causes the volume to be even lower...pairs easily with my iPhone (haven’t tried any other device pairings) All the functions are simple to use.

Unfortunately, the controls on the box are so well blended into the camouflage background, that you can't see them, so it's difficult to adjust unless you really know the instrument.

Incredibly disappointed with this purchase. We bought this speaker to use at the lake this summer so even though it was bought in February we didn’t actually go to use until this weekend (Memorial Day weekend). The blue tooth wouldn’t connect to some of our devices so I followed instructions to do a hard reset. Unfortunately the system wouldn’t turn on at all after that. It will charge just fine and lights up when on the charger. As soon as you take it off the charger it won’t power on.I watched a YouTube video on what might be the problem. As I got inside the speaker it was obvious this had been previously tampered with. Parts were duct taped together and there was a small piece of paper  floating around within the guts of the system. At this point I can only assume this is a refurbished model so likely the battery or mother board is fried.,1,1,2020-5-24,1,0,0
"Had the flip 3 before this, and the flip 4 is slightly larger but also puts down slightly more power as well. Use this thing every day at work and battery lasts multiple days in a row before charging. I prefer quality over loudness/outright bass and this definitely has good clarity and punch. Gets a bit dry and crunchy sounding as the volume goes up past a certain point. Am a huge fan of JBL speakers.",5,1,2019-11-5,1,0,0
"The only reason I’m giving this four stars is the sound and connectivity is really good,  the only issue is the whole “ water proof” part of it?? What does this mean exactly? Yes it did take a drink in a river and now it won’t power up, yes it was submerged in water few a minute maybe. Be very careful that yours doesn’t take a dunk into the toilet or any water. Other than that it’s a great speaker!",4,1,2020-6-29,1,1,0
"This is the one you want. The speaker is powerful enough to make conversation difficult in my kitchen, and it's indispensable camping gear. Surprisingly good bass response for such a small speaker.

Spring for the carrying case; you'll be glad you did.",5,1,2019-3-28,1,0,0
Really impressive. I was going to buy my husband a more expensive Bose speaker but the reviews on this made me change my mind. The reviews were right! It’s really great sound quality.

"This speaker worked amazing in the beginning. It was used for my classroom. It was loud, connected to my Bluetooth instantly. There were absolutely no complaints from me at all. Until 3 months later, it stopped working randomly. I mean literally, one day it was doing its thang and the next day when I went to go use it, it didn’t work. I immediately came to the review section of the speaker to see if I’m just going crazy. And apparently this happened to so many people where it just stopped working with no apparent reason. So 5/5 for the first couple months. Definitely a 0/5 because it won’t last long",3,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
"I have always liked JBL.  Great bluetooth  connectivity I was able to walk away from the speaker with my phone probably a good 75-80 feet and still didn't lose signal.

I got about 6 to 7 hours out of this speaker with the volume just over half way on my phone.  The speaker is loud..  Just wish the battery lasted longer.",4,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"This thing is great!  I am picky about sound quality but also spend a lot of time outdoors at our house on the water. This is a very good solution to get very decent sound in a small device with weather resistance. Easy to pair with blue tooth. Several members of the family have paired it and it sticks, although they may have to reconnect, but it shows up on their iPhone for example.  Well made, good sounding easy to use.",5,1,2017-8-25,1,1,0
"This isn't a computer generated or paid review. Searched for a week for a bluetooth speaker that could go outdoors, was at least splash resistant (This one claims to be waterproof, I don't wanna test that out lol) and had decent db/watts. Read many reviews and decided on JBL. So far, this speaker has it all. Just got it today and tested it out. Sounds great, the high end sounds wonderful and the low end is fantastic. Seems pretty rugged and durable. Not sure how well the battery life is yet, but I should be able to get a few hours out of it at full volume. I would recommend if you this is in your price range.

I've been a JBL fan for years, but this speaker sounds mushy. No distinct highs and lows. Maybe it's the type of music I play on it(mostly rock), I don't know. It is definitely better than my phone speaker, but still far below even basic bookshelf speakers. On sound alone I'd give it a 3.",4,1,2020-4-28,1,0,0

Charged it again for one of her practices died within thirty minutes as well I don't know if this is common or if it's my outlet but I won't ever buy from JBL ever again this was a waste of my money.

"I bought this speaker just over 3 months ago.  I used it every day for the first 3 weeks or so then not at all until the last couple days.  When I was first using it the battery would last at least 12 hours if not more.  After its last use I fully charged it, unplugged it, and set the speaker aside.  After a month and a half or so I picked it up and turned it on.  After 3 1/2 hours it was dead, i figured it lost some of its charge because it had been sitting unused for a while.  I let it charge over night and the next day same thing, 3 1/2 hours and the battery is dead. I like the speaker, it sounds great, but I'm disappointed with the battery life.EDIT: I found an article explaining the battery life issue.  The speaker was tested at MAX volume and lasted 4 hours but when tested between 50% - 75% it hit the 12 hour mark.  I personally think that if you advertise a 12 hour battery life it better be 12 hours at max performance!",2,1,2018-8-3,1,0,0

It is very annoying for your “Bluetooth” speaker to always need a charge while you are playing it. It also does NOT charge while you are listening to music.

I use this speaker for basically sitting outside with music on low while enjoying the yard. The sound is really good. Its crisp and clear with good base.  Now the battery lasts maybe 15 minutes.  It has all kind of Bluetooth connection issues with Siri and my Iphone. It drops and cuts out.  It has always had a problem connecting.  Its a shame cause JBL used to be a good name.

Loved the 1st JBL 4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker we purchased 2 years ago that I had to buy another when it was on sale.

only had this a few months but so far it works great.  I use it outside on patio. It has a pretty good range. I connect it to my cell phone with Pandora and leave the phone inside the house and close the door and it works fine.,5,1,2020-8-19,1,1,0
This is perfect for the home or by the pool... Even a barbecue. Sound is good and the battery lasts pretty long. My only gripe is that it turns off pretty fast after you disconnect and you have to power it on manually in order to reconnect.

I wasn’t expecting to be blown away by the deep rich tones or crisp highs. Frankly it doesn’t have much range but for the price and it’s purpose it’s one of the better sounding portable speakers. I like that with the app you can setup multiple flip 4’s. Battery gets a solid 8-10 hours at mid to low volume. I haven’t had the chance to crank it for extended periods of time but it’s teally not that kind of speaker anyway. Overall it’s a great speaker and I will use it often especially while traveling.,5,1,2018-1-23,1,0,0

"I like the camouflage design, like the volume, dislike the battery life. My workplace is a warehouse where I load delivery trucks (funny, right?). When the belt is on, my work environment is VERY loud and I needed a speaker that could drown out THAT noise with my own music. I've used it twice at work so far and with the volume all the way up the battery life lasts 3.5 hours. I need the speaker to work twice as long. If the product states on the box that it's going to last 12 hours, then it should last 12 hours even when the volume is up all the way. Still a good speaker but the battery life is a deal breaker for me. I'll give it try again with the volume not all the way up and then update if needed.**Update. Used it today at work with the volume not all the way up and it lasted the same. The box says it is supposed to last 12 hours yet it didn't even do half of that. I am returning.",2,1,2018-12-5,1,0,0

"I enjoyed using this speaker for about the first 12 months. I've used it for listening to conference calls, attached to my PC for audio (music and movies), connected to my devices via Bluetooth and streaming music. After about a year of use though, the device has started acting up. The issue appears to be battery related. I can no longer use it at higher volumes. When I do, it will work for about 15-45 seconds before it starts making a crackling sound and then shut off. I can prevent it from happening by lowering the volume. The only way to use it is to run it a lower volumes which is not ideal for outdoor use, my main reason for purchasing it. I might buy a replacement battery for it in hopes to restore its usability, but I'm looking at other Bluetooth speakers.",3,1,2019-7-22,1,0,0

JBL has an amazing sound quality.  We have several of these.  We take two to the beach and pair them for surround sound.  Waterproof and long playing on a single charge.  This is the smaller one but still has big sound.  Not exactly as crisp as our Bose but in a blind sound test it would be hard to tell which was which and for the value JBL wins hands down!,5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"Honestly a very good speaker.  However you can't use it with an aux cable.  When it's plugged in, the sound cuts out whenever what you're listening to gets too quiet.  I constantly miss lines in movies when using this.  Apparently this is a feature in which the speaker enters ""sleep mode"" to save power whenever it thinks there's just silenece, and then takes a few seconds to reengage.  The problem is that it will enter sleep mode almost immediately, constantly cutting out sections of what you're listening to.  If ""sleep mode"" kicked in after a minute it might be a good feature, but right now it's a very limiting bug.  I won't buy anything from JBL again so long as this continues.",2,1,2019-1-12,1,1,0
"This Bluetooth speaker works great! We spend lots of time out on the back deck and the iPad's built-in speakers are not loud enough even on a quiet day in the neighborhood.

Its to bad but I wouldn't recommend these cheap little speakers to anyone. When the speakers are not giving the feed back noise they are great and i especially liked the JBL Connect concept, that's why I bought 2. Boy was I swindled!",2,1,2018-12-16,1,0,0
Give it 3 stars overall because it doesn't charge while turned on.I've been struggling with this when battery dies and wanted to keep using the speaker so I connect it to the charger but the speaker will only charge when turned off.,3,1,2019-3-24,1,0,0
"For what it is worth, I bought this in 2017 and it is now mar 2019 and the device has failed. It worked well at first but it seems the batter will no longer hold a charge. I mostly used it While it was plugged in. Also the bass notes, prior to total failure would have a horrible bottoming out rattle as the battery charge got low. Good little speaker but do yourself a favor and just buy a different brand speaker. For the 100$ this thing is now garbage. Never once was it dropped or got wet. It sat on the shelf in my kitchen.",1,1,2019-3-10,1,1,0

"Welp, had it just over a year and the subwoofer just went out. Only used it about 3-4 hours a day Monday - Friday (typically) and never more that just above half volume.

"Got this speaker for my mom as a Christmas gift. She loved it!!!. This small speaker puts an incredible amount of sound and clarity. For the price you cant go wrong. Its a well know brand, and it looks sleek with any home/office decor.  The quality is as expected, per JBL standards. It feels nice and solid , good enough for the outdoors.  This speaker would make a great add on for a garage especially when you're working on a project.A+++",5,1,2017-12-25,1,1,0

I had the Oontz Angle Plus which I thought were excellent. I gave the Oontz to my relatives when I visited the Philippines because they loved them so much. I bought these as a replacement and there is no comparison. They sound much better and roughly the same size.,5,1,2018-8-19,1,1,0
So far so good. The only thing is that when using both there is a ton of static and they cut in and out while playing music and they are not even turned up loud. Separately they work fine but when syncing them together it’s terrible I might be sending them both back and getting something else.2/27/18 Update: I've had the speakers ( I am only using one at the moment) for maybe two weeks now. The battery life on this is not great at all. I charged it for a full day and used the very next day on a low volume and the battery was at half percent the next morning. It's a good speaker; loud and the bass is great but overall the battery life sucks.,3,1,2018-2-16,1,0,1
"Nice speaker. Mids and highs are nice and clear even at max volume. As with all speakers this small, there is no real bass to speak. For battery life reference, I have a JBL Flip 3 that I play at work at low volumes (Five “+” volume clicks up from 0). I get about 10 hours of playtime. Outside at 100% volume with the Flip 4, I get about 2 hours. The Flip 3 and 4 both have a 3000mAh battery so they should be pretty similar. I bring the Flip 4 kayaking and have even spent time with it in the hot tub. The IPX7 rating really holds up. Just make sure the cover for the Aux /USB port is closed.",5,1,2018-4-10,1,0,0
"I bought this solely for work, I work in a 150,000 sq foot warehouse and my area consists of about 1/4th of that. I have it on full blast and the quality is great..I wish it was a little louder due to forklifts always around my desk & the battery last longer but it does its job.",3,1,2018-12-24,1,0,0
I had an older model JBL for years (at least 5 years) and loved it. The charger input stopped working and I would need to wiggle it to get it to pick up the charger. Eventually that stopped working too and I had to retire it. I wanted another JBL but worried nothing would compare to my old one. This one is excellent! Better than my old one. It is waterproof which my last one wasn’t and the sound quality is superior. It gets very loud and the battery lasts for a very long time. I have no complaints about this speaker whatsoever!,5,1,2019-8-27,1,0,0
"Actually worked FINE for a month, then wouldn't pair with anything.  I tried everything.  Called customer support, tried different sources, talked to tech people, had a tech person come by......NOTHING.  JUST past the 2 month window from Amazon.  I have to throw it in the trash.  Too bad, I liked the sound.",1,1,2020-9-9,1,0,0
"When it first arrived the Flip 4 worked beautifully.  I use it almost exclusively indoors, for showers and living room ambiance. Recently the quality of the sound began degrading drastically. The lows are now basically inaudible. The sound as a whole is muffled and weak. I would not recommend this product if you're looking for something that lasts.",2,1,2019-11-4,1,1,0
"For what it's worth, I'm a musician and lover of quality audio. But I might be really bad at both, so take this with a grain of salt.I need tunes everywhere I go. In the garage, bathroom, funerals, etc. Some friends have JBL bluetooth speakers, and the sound really impressed me. So I bought the Flip 4 and I couldn't be happier! The sound is clear, big, and full. I have a macbook pro, and when I pair the two (with a quality chardonnay) it makes watching videos/movies a giggling joy!",5,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"Incredible sound quality from just one — but pair it with a second one and be prepared to be blown away!!!  Sounds like a system costing thousands. Almost like being at a rock concert!

Stunningly brilliant!!",5,1,2017-12-7,1,1,0
"Some toys you purchase in life turn out to be your favorites.  This little speaker has turned out to be one of those great toys.  So handy, portable and the sound quality from the little size is excellent meeting all of my needs.  Portability, small size, battery life and sound quality; I’m very impressed with my JBL Flip 4.  Would definitely purchase again should something happen to it.  Would also consider buying a larger one for all of the above reasons should the need for more sound arise.",5,1,2019-10-22,1,0,0
Awesome sound! Great price!JBL makes a good product for a reasonable price. I had a really great speaker made by HK. It was about $300 and I had it for about 6 years. I was heartbroken when it died.,5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0
"Great product, sounds amazing, and is definitely waterproof!  I take it out on my boat and have never been happier with the sound quality and peace of mind I get from knowing water won’t hurt it!  As long as you attach it to the boat or something that floats you have zero to worry about!Can use this version as a speaker phone as well. It’s not crystal clear, but it’s better than having to pick up your phone while driving a boat!",5,1,2020-7-7,1,1,0
"Great sound for the price. I take it everywhere and get many inquires. Most say they ""settled"" on a cheaper, small hockey puck sized thingy, and wish they had known.Great battery life, and quick blue-tooth reception, the best of all of my BT devices. A bargain!",5,1,2017-7-3,1,2,0
"Sound quality is perhaps not the best I've heard but if I consider its formfactor, it produces a good quality sound.  Small enough to fit in your hand (holding).  Less buttons but does all needed such as skipping pausing etc.  Use it a lot in my showers and vocal sound is pretty clear listening to audiobooks/podcasts.  Design is also beautiful.  I find it masculine.  Nice it has a holding string/hook.",5,1,2019-3-10,1,0,0
"Impressed with quality. Really great sound, especially for the size. I dont need to max out the volume.

My last outdoor Bluetooth speaker bit the dust. My search for an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker that was conducive for outdoor use began. I read the reviews of many speakers including Bose. Decided on the JBL Flip 4. Fast shipment and it was packaged well. Easy to pair with my IPhone. But the best part was the quality of sound. This little speaker packs a punch. I'm so very pleased with my decision to purchase the Flip 4. Highly recommend!,5,1,2018-2-26,1,0,0

"I bought this speaker about a year ago, its a great little soeaker with good sound quality/volume. I have used it quite a few times around the water and it has not had an issuue. It quickly became my go to Bluetooth speaker, with a good size for just stuffing into a backpack to bring along. Unfortunately recently it took a bit of a fall from the perch I had it set on out in the campsite, from that moment on it hasn’t worked the same and the volume/quality was ruined. It fell about 2’ but its built well so I fogured it would be fine, unfortunately that wasn’t the case. Speaker would be 5/5 if this hadn’t happened, since then I havee brought speaker to be recycled since it no longer works to the level it had in the past, back to my old bose Bluetooth speaker :( :(",3,1,2018-12-12,1,0,0

The sound quality is not bad just don’t listen with volume turned all the up. Loud enough for most uses. Sound quality is pretty good. I use mine in garage during exercise. Only thing the charging cable is defective. The plastic in USB PLUG is centered it should be off set. Plug does not fit. Not a deal breaker though. I have other plugs that fit. Other wise I would give 5 stars,4,1,2020-5-8,1,0,1

"Unfortunately the speaker I ordered 6 months ago is not authentic, coming from Abe’s Electronic Center. I was very skeptical at the beginning and I wanted to hold up the warranty that was expected from this company, though trying to contact them multiple occasions was useless as I was sent to contact JBL for warranty, so neither of them would guarantee a warranty as expected. JBL speakers ARE AMAZING, unless they’re fraudulent. Abe’s Electronic center I just contacted a few minutes ago was a representative who was extremely rude and kept on reading amazons customer service number and calling me wrong. Beforehand, I contacted amazon before that and they instructed me to call Abe’s Electronic Center. Overall the speaker I purchased was fake and I’m extremely disappointed I lost my money when i made this purchase. The speaker I have does not retain the same bass quality, the durability isn’t real as the RUBBER edges are now peeling off which can be seen on the front and at the bottom of the left speaker. The stitching between the fake (left) and real (right) JBL speakers are also different where in person I can see through the stitching for the fraudulent speaker. The fake one is smaller and the quality is noticeably lacking. No longer can I trust online purchases from Amazon for simple speaker brands as the authenticity is questionable, ultimately I am NOT satisfied.",1,1,2018-11-7,1,0,1

We played the speaker for about 10 hours one day and then used it just about every day for about an hour a day and the battery lasted 8 days before completely dying.  Highly recommend and would definitely buy from this brand.",5,1,2018-7-18,1,0,0
"Bought this as a house-warming gift for my friend who just moved into a new apt on his own. We opened it & tried it out as soon as we got to his place. To be fair I thought it would be bigger than it was but honestly the sound is amazing, lows & highs so we can't complain. Giving it 5 stars because it exceeded my expectations",5,1,2018-12-6,1,1,0
"The sound on this was great and I enjoyed it's connectivity and features. I bought it in April of 2018 and it would hold a charge for 6-8 hours. Now it's October 2019 and I can barely get an hour of music on a full charge. I've then tried to recharge it with a USB charger battery, and that doesn't seem to work very well. I know I am past any warranty or return time limit, unfortunately. If there was a way to change out the battery that might be a useful upgrade for this unit.",2,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"When this speaker worked, I liked it quite well.  I bought this in 2017 and it worked perfectly for about 18 months.  Then I noticed that the battery life was slowly decreasing.  Eventually it would only run for about 5 minutes after being fully charged.  I contacted JBL customer service and they sent over some trouble-shooting tips, but none of them worked.  Since it was out of the warranty period they offered me a 20% off code for their website to buy a replacement.  However, I am contemplating if I want to buy another JBL and have the battery die in another 18 months again.",3,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0
"This speaker has great sound, but the battery life isn’t the greatest. Not 12 hours.  The only thing I don’t like about this speaker is the annoying loud sound that plays when you turn it on/off. Especially when all you’re doing is listening to calming music, when you shut it off there’s a loud sound that plays to let you know it’s shutting off. Really? Is that necessary? It’s always the same volume too, regardless of how low you’re listening to music. Other than that, good quality product.",4,1,2018-12-26,1,1,0
"This is the best thing I have ever bought for myself! Now I can listen to music in the bathroom when I shave my legs. Fantastic sound quality! Great Bluetooth range (I can keep my non water resistant phone out of the are fore mentioned bath area). Worth every cent! I’m a musician and I trust JBL for my big sound system, I’m so happy to find the brand’s smaller components are just as lovely. Highly recommend!",5,1,2019-1-15,1,0,0
"UPDATE: Does last 12 hours if not all the way up 100% volume on a bicycle out on trail. It works 12 hours inside. It works 3 hours full blast on a bike. Got caught in major downpour, left in my water bottle cage. No problems just cleaned the dust from another ride. I would like 12 hours on full blast. Can’t complain though.Original: Just a little over 3 hours of battery life on a FULL charge. How is this close to 12 hours?",5,1,2020-5-7,1,0,0
Great quality and for playing music on the field during soccer practice. It could be heard to an extent from the entire field if volume is turnt all the way up. I’ve dropped it and kept in inside a bag many times and it’s very durable. Perfect if you want to jam out in the shower without worrying about water damage to the speaker.,5,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0
Amazing. It's way better than my old Sony Bass Boosted bluetooth speaker. It was an XB20. COMPARING THE XB20 TO THIS FLIP 4 Pshhhhhhh..... Way better. Sure the sony BB has strobe lights but it doesn't have speakers that surround most of the speaker limiting the volume output. I saw this specific speaker on youtube top 5 in budget. I highly recommend if you don't wanna spend $250 for the Bose bad boy speaker (not actual name)Anyways to summarize!,5,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0
"I absolutely LOVE this little speaker! I now have 3 of them!! They have fantastic sound, are small & portable (I took mine to Hawaii), great charging life, and are very durable. There's a toddler in the house that loves to carry them around (and drop them 🤦).  I can easily connect all three of mine to play the same thing throughout the house!HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5,1,2019-1-3,1,0,0
"This is a great speaker. The Bluetooth connection is strong, I haven't lost it yet! It is compact and powerful. I returned the sony one because it was just too muffled. This on is crystal clear! The bass is good enough for me and rather impressive for a speaker this size. The highs and midrange are clear as glass! The battery lasts a long time and it charges quickly. I recommend this speaker! I would buy another!",5,1,2018-7-19,1,0,0

Excellent speaker. Impressive sound and very compact. So good I purchased a second one. Easy stereo link up. Placement greatly enhances the sound. The mids are more outstanding than I anticipated. Battery life is very good. The dual bass radiators pack enough punch. Very clear at max volume. Impressed. Good price and very compact. No complaints.,5,1,2019-3-25,1,0,0
2 years and it won't stay on after 5 minutes. Speaker indicates that it is fully charged and yet battery is dead. Contacted Harmon group and because it is out of warranty they gave me a 20% off coupon for the purchase of a new one. Replacing the battery Is the correct answer instead of just tossing it away.,1,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
"I don't normally take the time to review the products I buy on amazon, but this little speaker delivered a lot more than I could ever have expected. I bought this speaker to use at work and home (I work in a shop that is very loud with pneumatic tools constantly being used). Sounds great, has great battery life, and is also waterproof on top of everything else and just seals the deal. I would like to see the battery life increased with the upcoming models but I really can't complain when it sounds as great as it does. I wouldn't even look at another bluetooth speaker and would recommend this to anyone that was quality sound and some durability along with it.",5,1,2017-10-8,1,1,0
"Awesome sound! takes the place of the old Boom Box only with much better sound, when a bunch of us are hanging out. IMO opinion, it has plenty of bass, clarity and volume. I'm not an expert but I do look for a great sound to satisfy myself and others around the group, the Flip4 has it.Battery life is about 4 hours, I guess, it hasn't run out on us yet.",5,1,2017-7-28,1,1,0
"I've only briefly tested the speaker inside my home at the moment, but I was surprised by how loud this little guy can get.  I'm sure it will be more than capable and sufficient when outdoors as well. Being a JBL product, which I feel is well regarded brand,  it lives up to its reputation. I can't wait to take it out on the water and have no fear doing so.",5,1,2017-8-17,1,1,0
"Great speaker, especially for the price. Easy to setup and charge. For the size speaker the sound is great. I like the size too. Not too small, not to large. Compared to our sound bar speaker (which is much larger and has a subwoofer) the sound is a bit lacking but that’s to be expected.",5,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"The sound is what you'd expect from JBL, solid and full. Battery could be better, but it does allow you to charge while playing. What I personally don't really like is that it doesn't really stand well, it keeps rolling and if you place it on one of the sides, it affects the sound quality.",4,1,2019-8-6,1,0,0
"Wow. Bought this for a float trip last weekend (26JUL19-28JUL19) sound quality is wonderful. Had the speaker in the bottom of the canoe, no worries with water. Speaker lasted over 12 hours at volumes between 60-100% probably 70% on average. The speaker actually didn’t die, we just went to bed, so it could’ve had another couple of hours. Very very happy with this purchase!",5,1,2019-7-29,1,0,0
"This speaker is really amazing ! Considering it's size it sure can light up a room ! It sounds much better indoors that  outside, but even outside it still manages to sound amazing. The bass on the speaker is so great, and it is to leveled out and clean, nothing sounds overpowered, its all perfectly even from the hi's to the low's. If you buy this speaker you definitely won't regret it. I've dropped this speaker so many times it's been wet and tossed around but it still is amazing quality. The only problem is that, I've dropped it over 30 times and one time I dropped it from at least 10 feet and the battery life while paired with JBL connect+ drains really fast, and whenever I play it full volume the battery dies fast, but when I first bought it , it lasted at least 5 hours full volume and like 12hours on halfish volume. I don't regret buying this product and I look forward to seeing a JBL FLiP 5!!",5,1,2018-10-10,1,0,0
"I would love to give this product a five star review but unfortunately my JBL charging port is broken and I can’t fully charge it. I’ve tried other chargers but alas I can’t full insert them fully leaving my speaker on low battery.But this little speaker is amazing, if you’re looking for a small speaker with a big punch without that Bose Priceline than this is your pick. I take it camping, hikes, beach days, and music festivals.",3,1,2019-3-24,1,0,0
This little JBL has the best sound of any bluetooth speaker I've purchased to date. Use it while camping a was surprised at how good it sounded. Love that it is waterproof since I live (and camp) in the rainy PNW.I would definitely recommend this speaker to anyone who likes a nice balanced sound.,5,1,2018-9-7,1,1,0
"I tested 3 other waterproof speakers, and this one was the smallest of the 3 and it outperformed all of them by leaps and bounds. The distance the bluetooth picks up is as advertised, and the sound quality is superb at it's highest level. Additionally the base is unreal for such a small speaker. Overall couldn't be more impressed. I use to have a bose mini, and it's better than that one and the bose isn't water proof!",5,1,2017-9-25,1,1,0
"I bought this because I work from home and I like playing my music while I work, it doesn’t last 12hours which makes me sad and I can’t play music while it’s charge. The volume is  pretty good and it’s a nice size but I will be looking for another one with more battery life.",3,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"Speaker works great. Took it to the beach , sat on the beach , sat the speaker on top of the yeti and it blares country music so loud. I ended up growing a mullet sitting there in the sand. 2 bald eagles flew over, screeching, and dropped a woman right in front of me. It took 2 eagles because ya know , if she ain’t 380 she ain’t a lady. She landed right on my speaker but this thing holds up. She muffled the sound a little bit but as soon as 6 of us picked her up it sounded brand new. Also waterproof , I took it out in the ocean with me and a shark grabbed me from behind. I fought him off , speaker in hand about 3 meters deep and she still works like a charm. Highly recommend",5,1,2019-10-10,1,0,0
"I really love the speaker, my complaint is the battery life! It only lasts about 3 hours on a full charge, listening to it with the volume all the way up. That’s very disappointing. I really want to give it 5 stars but based on that, I can’t. Other reviews and even the specs say it should last much longer but I’ve tried it on 3 different occasions, each time it died.. pretty disappointing since the main reason I bought it was to take to the beach and river for the day. Maybe I got a defective one?? Idk..",3,1,2018-7-30,1,1,0
"This speaker sounds awesome for its size... actually sounds great for a speaker much larger. Great for travel, I carry it a lot in my saddlebags on my motorcycle.

"I got this at Christmas time for a good price. I think engineers who fit such good sound into such a small package are genius. The sound quality is at least as good as the Wonderboom I use at work. I am not sure how durable it is since it sits on a desk and I haven’t had occasion to test it in water. Overall, I highly recommend this. It just works as promised.",5,1,2019-2-7,1,0,0
This speaker is amazing! The sound quality is so good and it never loses my Bluetooth connection (within my apartment).

"Sound quality is very good considering the size of this speaker. The amount time between recharge is extremely good. I seldom  have the volume turned up to maximum and it easily plays sixteen hours. It also recharges very quickly.  Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase. The only thing I didn't like is the ends don't have much protection, in fact the instructions tell you not to touch or push on the ends. That's a small trade off for the sound quality and not a deal breaker.",5,1,2017-7-3,1,0,0
I have owned portable speakers for years now - we love to go to the pool and to the beach with them. Many have claimed to be waterproof and all have claimed to have great sound. Most fail on one or both of those claims. I did my research and purchased this bad boy. This thing not only sounds fantastic for its purposes but is truly waterproof and incredibly easy to control. I place it by the pool and control my music with my Apple Watch. It is loud and perfect for crowded outdoor uses. It also isn’t bad to look at.,5,1,2018-4-13,1,0,0

"This is the best speaker I've tried so far, the price also is pretty great. I ordered (and paid more for it) in red, it came white which i HATE (and was less expensive than red), i'm disappointed with the seller for this and the shipping time; it took one month to arrive, which was not estimated at the beginning. The speaker sounds amazing, loud and clear, the battery life is also great, i charge it once or two times in a month and lasts days and days playing all types of music medium to high volume. I would definitely recommend and buy this speaker again.",5,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0
"Just received this little beauty a week before scheduled delivery date (gotta love Amazon)!  This little guy is a great speaker...I listen to a lot of bass heavy music (dance, edm, rap) and I'm pleasantly surprised at how it handles at the uppermost volume levels. Can't expect much bass outta such a small speaker, but it does have the radiators on either end that definitely push a little bit of air and achieve a good overall sound.  The clarity of this thing is very nice and unlike some other speakers I've heard, when the bass hits, the clarity does not suffer....gotta love that, shows great quality and that's how I measure how good a speaker is.  A sure recommend and the small size makes portability very accommodating....good job JBL!!!",5,1,2017-7-20,1,1,0
I had this bad boy fully charged before I went on a roadtrip. It was put off to the side and nearly forgotten about. When I pulled it out to use weeks later it still had battery life. I was amazed.

Really well constructed speaker. The Bluetooth is very stable and connects so quickly without any issues or interference. Has great sound quality and the bass is prominent compared to other Bluetooth speakers I've used which just seem to only have treble while still being loud which hurts the ears. Super loud for the size and absolutely water proof. This speaker makes me trust JBL and Harman Kardon products. This is more than what I expected from this product and I am very pleased with it. I'm considering getting a second one just because of how well it functions,5,1,2017-6-12,1,2,0
I use it for work with the volume all the way up i get less than 4hrs. Thats the only reason im giving it 3 stars wish the battery life was a little better.Sound: I work in a loud environment so its more of a personal speaker for a small area that im working at the moment other wise its not the loudest speaker because it has more bass than Wounder boom speaker,4,1,2019-3-10,1,0,0
"This is my second JBL. The first failed after being left outside over night in the early fall (no rain, no snow, not too cold). I figured it was our fault so I bought the 4.

Bass is good at low volumes, could definitely use more bass at high volumes, but that’s the limit of a tiny speaker. Totally worth the purchase",5,1,2019-7-28,1,0,0
"So far so good! Mids & highs are pretty comparable to the Flip 3 I have but the bass hits harder making a better complete listening experience in my opinion. The battery life seems to be drastically improved from the Flip 3 as well so as long as it holds up, I won't need to hunt for a new speaker ANYTIME SOON",5,1,2019-7-31,1,0,0
"Great sound!  It was very easy to set up the Bluetooth connection.  I am able to hang this from the shower head and listen to music or audio books and there has not been a single issue.  Best of all - the range is fantastic.  From one end of my house to the other without any break up.  There is signal loss with distance + no line of sight, but I take it to different rooms with-in 30 feet without any problems.",5,1,2018-9-4,1,0,0
"This speaker was working great until about only 3 WEEKS of using it! Started to hear crackles when I was playing music, I originally thought it was my phone. But I realized that when I put on headphones to listen to my music on my phone the sound was fine it was only after putting on the bluetooth feature to connect to the wireless JBL speaker that the sound would produce crackles...so its the speaker. I want my money back.",1,1,2018-9-7,1,1,0
"I really love this speaker, the bass is great. If you like to hear the bass in your music then I recommend getting this. It's really durable. I dropped it by accident and everything was fine.

This little thing delivers clear, crisp high quality sound that does not seem to come from its tiny body! Plenty of base pours out of the innovative little ""woofers"" at each end.

Well I received a dud. It won't start or power on straight out of the box. I've started a return immediately and Amazon is typically great about defective returns. But this was disappointing as I wanted to use it this holiday weekend. So in the spirit of transparency- I've ordered another one to arrive in two days. Will do another review when I receive the new one. Charging this one and there's no lights or power. Used a different cord from one included in case it was the power cord and no dice. So it's definitely the unit. I bought the black one as the blue one was backordered.UPDATE: Amazon sent me another JBL right out in the mail. Got it for the weekend and I LOVE this JBL. Sound is amazing. Waterproof is awesome. The only feature it's missing - is the ability to float. I've since bought 3 more of these.,5,1,2017-6-28,1,6,0

They are shocked when they see my little speaker in the corner.  😁",5,1,2020-3-29,1,0,0

"I like the Bluetooth range on this thing. The sound is loud, a little muddy on the bass,  but not majorly. You can adjust that on your device. I also like the fact that I can take it in the shower.

"LOVE THIS SPEAKER!!! This speaker sounds amazing and can be used anywhere. It says it is waterproof but I rather not submerge it purposely to find out. Bluetooth is fast and it’s so easy to use. The family has requested this speaker for the last 2 years for the beach. We link up 3 of them and our group of 11 has music all day. The sun, heat and humidity hasn’t affected it. Good volume range too. Can’t say anything negative about this bad boy.",5,1,2019-7-21,1,0,0
"It was a lot smaller than I thought, but that made it all the better! Such a powerful sound from such a small device, so I was thoroughly impressed. Wonderful packaging, and instructions are fairly simple. I tried it out in my living room and the sound resonated through the entire house. Definitely will be using it for background music for dinner parties, and can be used for outdoor parties as well, since it is waterproof. It has a little strap that you could put around your wrist so you don't have to worry about accidentally dropping it. I wish they had a pink color, but the gray is super chic and matches any aesthetic. My sister wanted to buy her own after seeing mine. Definitely would recommend to a friend.",5,1,2017-8-17,1,1,0
It’s a great little speaker with a powerful sound for how big it is. My biggest issue is that the battery will completely die on you after about 6 months of use. It will require the speaker to be completely plugged in or it won’t stay on. Very disappointed about that,2,1,2019-9-6,1,0,0
"I work in a manufacturing plant which is pretty loud. Its not loud enough to hear over all the power tools going at once, but is pretty loud and has great sound quality.  Im pleased.

Got this for my wife since she was running off with the Bluetooth conference call speaker I use in my office. This speaker really puts out the decibels and has excellent sound quality.

This speaker cranks out the jams.  Great sound and volume for something so small and I'm always surprised by how long the battery lasts.  This is my second one of these--I keep them at different ends of the house.  My first one has lasted 3+ years and show no signs of age.My friend has a similar size Bose speaker.  It sounds a bit better but costs far more.  The JBL is a great purchase.  Don't hesitate.,5,1,2019-9-5,1,0,0
The JBL Flip 4 is a very nice bluetooth speaker. I use it almost every day while working and the battery lasts more than 10 hours. Though the louder the volume the shorter the charge. It fits nicely on the dash of my truck and the sound quality is great.,5,1,2019-9-15,1,0,0

"I bought this speaker because I was looking to replace a low-end, four-year old Bluetooth speaker that I barely used anymore because it was starting to buzz. This time around I wanted something nicer, but I really was not into spending more than $100. I think this is probably the best quality speaker for your money available. This thing sounds simply fantastic and there's quite a bit of rumble to it for being about the size of a water bottle. I haven't submerged it in water (and probably I won't on purpose) but it definitely doesn't mind stray drops from inside the shower. I haven't had any issues with the Bluetooth connection, and after a few days of (casual) use, I haven't had to charge it yet. If you're like me and you need something quality so you don't have to be tied-in to your phone or computer (or god-forbid listen to music through your laptop speakers) this is a product a highly recommend.",5,1,2018-5-27,1,0,0
"This is one of the best bluetooth speakers anyone can get right now for the price. The built quality, overall sound, bass and bluetooth connectivity is top notch. The only issue I had was the battery life. I've been using this speaker for almost a year now and when I'm listening to music at full blast, it only lasts me about two hours. It was very easy to notice the difference from the first time I bought it vs now. If JBL works to master the battery life usage, I believe they could create the ultimate bluetooth speaker (s), if they already haven't yet.",4,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0

Great product from JBLBought this speaker for its small size to take on our trip to Cancun. It sounds so amazing that I now take it to work to listen to it  One of my coworkers loved it so much he bought one as well! We link them together which works really well by the way and listen to them while we work. The battery life isn't great but lasts probably 5-6 hours with both bluetooth and linked together... We just keep them plugged up and they last all our 12+ hour shift!,5,1,2017-9-27,1,1,0

After about 2-11months of use it goes to shit! Now the one I brought lasted me for about a yr before the battery wouldn’t last for shit it wouldn't keep a charge. And the sound became distorted highly disappointed. My mother brought the same one before these problems came into play with me. And hers started the same thing in about 2 months never dropped 30% of the time outside and the rest in the house.,1,1,2019-5-4,1,1,0
"This is a great speaker. It sounds great, and it looks pretty sleek. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it is quite expensive, and I had one break on me after just a few months of light use.

"We have a Sonos system throughout our home, but don’t have speakers outside on our deck, so we purchased this to use. The speaker itself is solid, durable and compact.

LOVE THIS SPEAKER!! I have a Bose Soundlink that just wasn't cutting it and bought the JBL Flip 4 as a replacement. The Bose battery was already failing and just simply wasn't loud enough.

It's compact enough to fit into a suitcase or backpack. Perfect for long weekend road trips. A winner.",5,1,2017-9-24,1,1,0
"I bought this speaker as a replacement for a speaker included in a video package.  The video package is for projecting images from inside a window for holiday displays.  The included speaker had a short battery life with little volume.  The JBL Flip 4 proved to be just the ticket.  Its battery life was great, lasted the entire evening with plenty left.  The volume was more than enough for people walking by to hear it plainly even though plenty of trick or treaters were yelling as they walked by.  And I didn't have the volume up to its maximum.  With its small size, I was able to hide it in a bush outside the window without being seen.  I look forward to finding more applications to use the JBL Flip 4.  A great value.",5,1,2018-11-13,1,0,0

For years, we have been using our laptop outside for music and I decided enough was enough.  For three straight days we played this in rather hot weather in the beating sun and each day it lasted around 9 hours.  The quality of sound was great and we had no issues at all with any skipping.  I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra money but I'm very pleased and would definitely recommend.",5,1,2019-5-29,1,0,0

"While I am happy with my purchase, I am a disappointed and confused about the sound quality. Reviews I read all mentioned a lack of bass. I found this speaker very bass heavy and the mids very muddy and weak sounding. Not real sure why this is the best, when you can buy small computer speakers for this price and size that are much more accurate. Sure would be nice if they would put a simple EQ circuit in these things. Cost would be a couple of dollars or just get rid of the speaker phone/computer interface stuff.The build quality seems to be solid.Just wish it sounded better.",4,1,2019-3-14,1,0,0

"Not to sound like an old man, but the sound is excellent for the size of this fella. Picked up the Camo version and it looks great, fits perfectly in my bicycle water bottle cage and puts out some amazing sound.

Best water bottle cage speaker for the price IMHO.",5,1,2018-12-7,1,0,0
"The battery runs out a little fast; maybe I'm expecting too much especially because I play it for hours at a time. Either way, it's a good purchase.

From my experience, it seems to live up to that.",5,1,2019-10-9,1,0,0
"Liked least. Price is not 74.00 for 2 speakers it’s 2 speakers nicely boxed in one box.

"It looks great and it sounds very good for the size of the speaker. The reason I give it 3 *s is because of the recharge options.  It only comes with a USB charger for your computer. So besides the almost $100 you spend on the speaker, you have to spend extra money if you want to charge it up through an outlet. To me, it seems like that kind of thing should be included. To me, it makes me feel taken advantage of and nickel and dimed for extra money.",3,1,2019-7-3,1,0,0

The best product out there for the money. You wont be disappointed. I wanted something to use for my podcasts and music while I'm in my pool and this is perfect. Took it on the boat and had sound for 6+ hrs. I haven't tested the battery limits yet but it seems like it lasts for days on high volume. Its durable and the handle it comes with makes it easy to carry around. Teal color is really nice. I was going to get the Flip3 but for a few more dollars you get the ability to submerse it under water (just an insurance for me) and if you want to get another one you will be able to connect  them to amplify the sound. (Which I assume is especially helpful for siblings or best friends. I will eventually have a few around the house for when I'm deep cleaning different parts of the house and want seamless sound.) Note: this has the Connect + Plus feature and not the Connect feature as their earlier and other models. As of this time it can only connect to other Flip4s.  10/10 would recommend.,5,1,2017-7-11,1,5,0

I love that it is waterproof and durable because it gives peace of mind during our outdoor activities. It arrived just in time for our camping trip, everyone raved about the speaker and asked what kind it was/where to buy one. The only reason I gave it 4 stores is because I wish there was a button to skip a song on the actual speaker. It's not a huge deal or a deal breaker though. I can skip songs and change volume from my Fitbit or phone so it is still manageable but I would love to have that feature in a future model.",4,1,2018-9-3,1,0,0

I'm an audiophile myself where quality matters and I was a bit impressed by the size of the speaker and the quality it had.

The louder you play the music, the better it sounds with no distortion ever. I bring this thing everywhere with me and people love it. Even at the beach, with wide open space and ambient noise around, it explodes with sound and you can clearly hear and ""feel"" the bass. Way cool. Thanks Jbl!",5,1,2017-6-29,1,1,0
This was my first JBL Portable Speaker. I really like it and have been enjoying it very much. The sound is great for where I work...Airplane Maintenance Facility. So it is loud enough to hear above all the other noise going on. Battery is really good I charge it over night and last for my 8 to 10 hour shift. Great product highly recommend.,5,1,2017-12-11,1,1,0
Great speaker. I had been wanting it for a long time and didn’t want to spend that much. Prime day came around and I couldn’t pass it up. I’m very happy with the sound quality and by the volume. We use it outside around our pool and we can hear it crisp and clear.,5,1,2019-8-21,1,0,0
"This is a nice little speaker for the most part - decent battery, sound quality, etc.However, it's not even 2 years old and it just constantly turns off. Battery is charged, bluetooth connection is fine, but it'll shut off randomly during a song. It's incredibly annoying.",2,1,2020-3-31,1,0,0
This is perfect for my room in my shared apartment. I can use it in my room while I do work or I can move it into the living room when we have friends over- the sound quality is just as good at high or low volume. One of my roommates liked it so much that he got the same one in blue. A high quality speaker for an awesome price.,5,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"I Love the sound quality, i wish it went up higher actually, but I'm nuts so. It's a bit annoying connecting the bluetooth, switching between 3 devices but it connects quickly. The battery life is insanely great, I wonder how long that will last.... It's dope, I like it, I want to see how it does in a steamy bathroom and what not and really test it out but so far so good.",5,1,2019-11-17,1,0,0
"after watching many YouTube videos I decided to go ahead and purchase this little speaker and I’m really happy I did, the sound quality is incredible the battery life is good for what I use it for which is mainly for workouts and I only workout for about an hour so it’s not problem for me I also use it while playing video games to listen to music or YouTube videos but I can easily charge it from my pa4 in case the battery is low in conclusion I’m happy with my purchase and I think this is a great product.",5,1,2019-6-21,1,0,0
"I've had this for a year now. It stands up to a lot of tests. It's loud, durable, weatherproof, but most importantly, the sound quality hasn't degraded over time from frequent loud usage. I know many people who have this, as well. Great speaker! Long battery, too.",5,1,2019-4-5,1,1,0
"Sounds great for small speaker. Cool feature allows to ""link"" to other units for broadcast of music. Charged up fast. Great buy. Easy to use. Bluetoothed with my phone no problem. Pause/play on device. Bought waterproof case for it.",5,1,2020-3-13,1,0,0
"Bought this last July. It's decent, but not actually that loud. Main issue is the fact that, after semi-infrequent use over the last 10-ish months, it simply stopped working. I had it in a backpack, and had been using it roughly every day for about 4 days, and, after pulling it out to charge that weekend, it would not do so, nor would it turn on. It's never been dropped significantly, to my knowledge. It hasn't had contact with water in weeks. As I said, it's only 10 months old and was not used heavily. It worked just fine up until it didn’t at all. Buy if you plan to have a nice soundin, sleek, waterproof speaker for under a year, andrun useless piece of rubber afterwards.",2,1,2018-4-22,1,0,0
Absolutely love my JBL speaker! The sound is so clear! And there so much power behind this little speaker LOL I would highly recommend anybody purchase a JBL! Perfect Bass! Long lasting battery! And my favorite color is turquoise so I absolutely love coloring LOL are you clumbsy like me? If you drop it? It definitely has protection so it doesn't shatter LOL it can definitely take some wear and tear!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND,5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0
"What can I say, you get what you pay for . The quality and sounds from this speaker is second to none . I have a Bose portable speaker which is great but the battery life sucks .

I've used this speaker multiple times and haven't needed to charge it. Sound is great.  We used it for my daughter's softball team warmups and everyone could hear clearly.  I love the size fits into any bag I need.  Would recommend for sure,5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"The speakers only worked for about 6 months and it just stopped! it stopped connecting, no sound, no charge, NOTHING!  A few months before it stopped , Bluetooth connection would just randomly disconnect while being used and id have to shut it off to restart the device. Even when plugged to a charging source! I loved the color of the speaker ( teal), the sound was very average ( lots of noise). It had such great reviews, but my experience was very disappointing. Definitely didn't get my moneys worth! :(",2,1,2019-5-22,1,0,0
I would not recommend this product to anyone!! I bought this product for a gift  Once the gift was received 2 months later  it would not hold a charge and I am unable to return the product due to the time limit. Very disappointed.,1,1,2020-8-6,1,2,0

"Worked great for the first few months, then it wasn't able to play for more than 10 minutes without needing to be plugged in. It takes ages to reach full charge and dies within minutes. Now, it can't play at all without being permanently plugged in. So much for being a portable speaker. Naturally I can't take this anywhere now, really let me down here.",1,1,2019-3-27,1,1,0
"Ordered by my husband. We take this speaker almost everywhere when traveling. Puts out great sound, I typically have to tel him to turn it down.

"The sound quality is good, and I have had no problems with the mic cutting out on Zoom calls. HOWEVER, the entire thing will shut itself off. No warning, just disconnects. This is not useful in the middle of a webinar or longer call! While it helps to keep the unit plugged in (I can get 45 to an hour), it does not totally solve the problem. The result is that I must stop the webinar I am leading and reconnect which makes me look rather incompetent.",3,1,2020-8-10,1,0,0
"Love this speaker so far.  Great sound, and a perfect balance between volume and size.  Good battery life.  Don't have to worry about covering it quick if it starts raining.  I need to find a better way to stick it in a bottle holder on my bike.  Zip tied to the frame at the moment, which works great, but a little bit of a hassle to remove to recharge or to use it elsewhere.",5,1,2017-7-12,1,1,0
"Having owned the Flip 3 and praised both its sound and value.  I have the same praise for the Flip 4 except even more so.  The sound feels more controlled and clear than its predecessor, the battery life increased, and there have been numerous small but thoughtful improvements to the design.  Highly recommended.",5,1,2017-4-23,1,2,0
"this speaker is very well made and connects quickly to your device via bluetooth. I mean instantly....it has plenty of volume for use in rooms, like a bedroom or bathroom. I have not taken it outside yet to try it. The sound quality is great for a subwoofer but there's no pitch... no highs in the sound... it almost sounds a little drowned out.. not sure.... anyway.... I enjoy the speaker and would recommend it....",3,1,2019-3-4,1,0,0
"I was on my brother in laws boat and he was playing music from this JBL Flip 4 and I thought this had the best sound I've heard in such a small unit.

I love it, and it's waterproof....",5,1,2017-8-24,1,1,0
"Una vez mas, JBL me queda mal con la batería y cargador de esta flip 4,,,  compré la flip 4 porque me dió ese mismo problema la flip 2 que tenía.... a los 2 años ya no cargan, se agota la batería, se arruina el conector y ya no te cubre la garantía... tendré que comprar Bose ahora en adelante, lástima porque sí tienen buen sonido",3,1,2019-4-15,1,1,0
"i like this product i have been using it for over 6 months, the white one kinda gets a little bit dirty otherwise this is a product for one room use.

This speaker provides excellent sound for its size and I would give it 5 stars but for the really irritating sounds it makes when turned on or off and activating Bluetooth pairing. They are quite loud and obnoxious and can't be muted or even quieted; I can't imagine what their development team was thinking (there are numerous complaints on JBL's own support site about it).,4,1,2018-4-29,1,0,0
The speakers are great in.a small space ... but go outside and they can't compete with the collection of outside noises. You open your eyes and realize how weak the speaker is amazing sound indoors a quiet house and one of my two speakers will not charge and Amazon requires I speak with JBL rather than process of product exchange after all JBL has a lifetime warranty and replacement of 1 to 3yrs these days. It is in the connection from the charging cord to the device.,4,1,2020-2-2,1,0,0

"Although material quality is great, and the sound is ok, it has a ""feature"": if your music has low intensity sections or silence, the speaker will cut out the sound completely, making you miss some sections of the music. And then, when the sound increase the loudness, the speaker will cut about 1 second of your music, missing some parts. I was very angry when I discovered that, and it will happen both via bluetooth or AUX. Just don't buy it, find a not stupid speaker. Search for ""Problem with JBL Flip 4 cutting off audio after a few seconds of silence"" on Youtube for a example. It is a ""feature"", and if its a hardware design, no firmware update will correct that.",2,1,2019-1-6,1,1,0

I have used it twice now for beach days. It lasts hours on full blast and is loud. Only thing is after a while it starts to disconnect its self from bluetooth. Not sure if that's from being in the sun. But it's totally worth the buy.,5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"I've had this well over a year, still works the same, very nice speaker, has a nice sound and weight to it. The bass is lacking a little bit, but I definitely recommend this, it's the best portable speaker I've purchased. The battery life is pretty bad though, it won't last you more than an hour or two on full volume. The sound fills up a car perfectly, and if outside, the sound carries quite nicely.

PAY THE LITTLE BIT EXTRA FOR THE PROTECTION PLAN. I don't usually do reviews but the reviews helped me purchase this item. I would have given a 5 start if mine stayed working. It worked fine when I got it and I loved it!. It sat unused for the winter. the other day turned it on. It came on but the Bluetooth would not connect. I gooled it and it seems that happens a lot with these. But what they said to do didn't work. Then It would not come on unless I had it connected to power. Very frustrating!!!! Well I had purchased the 4 year Asurion Protection plan for around 11.00 and It was one of the easiest things I had ever done.

Perfect speaker. Every other speaker claims crystal clear sound or good base is nothing like this one.

The only thing I don't like is that it comes with a USB cable only - not a wall charger.",5,1,2018-4-21,1,0,0
Gave it as a gift to my Bf and he loves it. He works outside and when it started raining the speaker was fine and still played well.

I bought 2 these a little over a year ago and one of the speakers is starting to fail. It plays for a few minutes and then begins to crackle and then goes dead. I’m guessing it had a 1 year warranty. For a hundred bucks it should have lasted longer.,3,1,2019-12-15,1,0,0
"It's a good size to carry around and the sound is rich and just enough bass. Not sure that I need waterproof, but it's nice to know that it is. My son has the charge 3 but I wanted something a bit smaller. This has less bass than the charge 3 but still a nice balanced sound. I wish I could turn off the startup and shutdown sounds, but that's a minor nitpick. Comes with a cord so you can hang it, or it can be placed horizontal or on it's end but I think it sounds best horizontally. I compared with UE, Sony, etc. but I'm happy with this choice.",5,1,2018-8-17,1,0,0
I got tired of buying those cheap speakers that would go dead every hour. I really like this speaker. It has great sound quality and the speaker itself is very durable and it connects to my IPhone XS Max very fast.,5,1,2019-12-5,1,0,0
"I bought it 2 months ago and I use it almost everyday. It's totally loud enough for parties but quiet enough for when you want to sleep with music playing. Also useful for showers because it's waterproof. Its bass is amazing, as well as sound quality. The size is perfect to fit in any bag and even to carry it in your hand (because it has a tiny strap connected to it).",5,1,2019-2-25,1,0,0
Sounds great. Full range of sound. Can easily up the bass depending on what you place next to it. Super fun for shower. Love that the volume control buttons are so easy to find and feel.  Husband got it for me for Christmas but it would make a great gift for a Teen.,5,1,2019-1-6,1,0,0

"NEVER give 5 star reviews. I had to for this new speaker from JBL. Amazing battery life at 12 hours. Sleek design almost mimicking the Beats Pill, but in my opinion way better looking.

"super nice speaker actually really like it.  The only thing i wish is that i did my research and bought one with 360 sound.  That's not the speakers fault though.

"Love these speakers. I got two and will someday add more. They link together and can make for a very inexpensive whole house sound system. Want more volume? Add more devices.

"The perfect portable speaker! I use this to teach an outdoor workout class and it projects really well. I do wish the battery life was just a bit better, but I can usually get away with using it a few days before having to charge it.

"Love it! At some Wal-Mart stores they have these set up to try out... This Flip 4 is just as loud as the Charge 3 it seems, I mean, almost exactly the same loudness!  Regarding sound quality, it sounds absolutley fantastic and way better than the JBL CHarge 3. The CHarge 3 is muffled compared to this. Anyway, if you like LOUD, this thing gets pretty dang loud for a small room. Blah blah blah, buy it",5,1,2017-10-5,1,1,0

"I got this to pair with my blue flip 4 and black charge 3. I absolutely enjoy this speaker. It goes everywhere with me, bike rides, work, gardening. You dont need to blast it cause theyre pretty strong. I just got a seat post rack on my beach cruiser for the charge 3, but may bump it off for the xtreme 2. 20000 mah power bank, and you got music for hrs and hrs.Pro tip, charge your speakers at half battery or sooner just to extend the battery life.",5,1,2018-3-1,1,0,1
The title says it all.. It has a pretty good sound but it’s not like loud!! I mean I use it throughout the house but I know it wouldn’t be loud enough of the beach or a kickback.. and I literally have to charge it everyday. The battery life last maybe 3 hours tops for me. I might have a defective one idk...,4,1,2020-8-10,1,1,1
So glad I bought this !! I was still using the old cassette adapter connected to my phone in my work machine. I got tired of it jamming up or just crappy audio so I found this thing.

"The sound quality is really great, but if listening at high volume the battery doesn't last anywhere close to 12hrs. Kinda disappointed with how quickly the battery runs down. 2 maybe 3 hrs of run time is all than can be expected from my jbl flip 4 speaker.  Personally from experiencing both products if was shopping for another speaker, id definitely reccomend the ultimate ears boom line of speakers over jbl.",3,1,2018-7-4,1,0,0

This came very fast two days stoked about that thank you! It came fully charged so I was able to blast my music while I worked today. This speaker is smaller but just as loud if not louder than the JBL3 older model. The volume of sound doesn't distort the music like most other small speakers do.

"This product is out of Warranty  and I have reached out to the JBL customer service and they are unwilling toreplace it. I would not recommend buying this speaker. We didn't take it out of the house and used it very little before it stopped working. This speaker is waterproof and leads you to believe it is made to withstand the elements.

Love the speaker. Used to have the older version until it fell off a shelf and broke. The update is great. Sound is good and the bass quality is good for a compact speaker.

I've been using this speaker for three months now and I gotta say this is the best possible speaker money can get you at this price range.  Whenever I'm out and I wanna play my music I can tell you for sure you will get annoyed looks towards your way.For a decent sized room it's rather loud in public for example let's say you're walking you can hear the music at full volume (I can't guarantee this due to the fact that I haven't tried that yet also how loud the music or whatever you're playing from the speaker depends on how loud the device that's connected to the speaker is.),5,1,2017-7-5,1,0,0
This has some great sound. The bass drops off at about 50hz but that’s great for this size. The passive radiators allow great sound but they are a week point so if you plan to be rough then go with something totally enclosed.,5,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0

The JBL Flip is a powerful little speaker that's great for toting around the house or outside or wherever you're listening to things. I has the sound output of a bigger speaker with convenience and portability. I can hear it playing from the other end of the house, and it seems to have decent range when connected to the phone. I can pretty much go anywhere in my house without it dropping or stuttering. It's easy to use and sync with devices, too, which can be a weak point with bluetooth-connected devices. I haven't paid enough attention to the battery life, but so far it seems pretty reasonable compared to my dearly-departed speaker.",5,1,2018-10-24,1,0,0

This was a surprise Christmas gift from my husband who knows how much I love audiobooks. I listen to them while I’m cleaning and was pleasantly surprised to learn that phone calls also come through clearly. It is easy to set up and use and the battery has a good lifespan.,5,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0
"Great little device, packs nice sound. Only issue I have with it is the battery life. Gets me through my work day for about 5 hrs of an 8 or more hour day. I dont plan to test the waterproof part of it not that I dont trust it I just dont work around water. I do however work in a body shop and it keeps us working with good vibes through the jb flip 4.",4,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0

Last JBL product I will buy.  Won’t hold charge and sound is horrible.  Also bought earbuds and they stopped working within 6 months.  COWIN sells a much better product at a much better price.,1,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
Right out of the box it worked well. Sound is good and clear. Don’t know about battery longevity bc I just opened it. Thought it would be larger but sound is what I’m looking for. Sounds better than Sony s version.,5,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"I've only had 1 other cheap Bluetooth speaker, that i then attached to a Google Chromecast Audio  dongle, in the hopes that i could then purchase ANOTHER cheapy bluetooth speaker and ANOTHER Chromecast audio dongle in order to get crappy stereo sound.In the case with this JBL we cut out all the extra wires and setup for a very sleek , very small, yet very nice sounding speaker, that can eventually be linked with 100 other ""connect+"" devices",5,1,2017-7-17,1,6,0

"I will charge it for 3-4 hours or until all lights are solid. It will die or shut off 2-3 hours.  Sometimes  it will just shut off after a few songs. It has good volume and is light and compact but damn turning off all the time, i barely even use it because I'm sick it. Sometimes I'll have it on outside the bathroom during showers and it won't make it through a whole 15 minute shower even if I just take it off the charger or its showing a full charge. What a waste of money.",2,1,2018-2-11,1,0,0

"The JBL FLIP 4 is an amazing speaker. Is it better than other speakers at half the price? Maybe not. Are you paying for a better warranty, product support, or user manual. My experience with these things would suggest not.",3,1,2020-6-14,1,0,0
Fully charged night before. Awesome sound for two days till battery ran out. Would not recharge after the first charging. Wouldn't connect to Blue tooth. Tried different charging cables and adapters.  No luck,1,1,2020-4-14,1,1,0
"I love this speaker, I bought my wife a Bose revolve which was the best sounding speaker I had heard till I got this. The Bose is very nice, but the Flip 4 offers better mid range, and a voice forward sound to me. The fact that it's water proof is amazing, and the battery last forever at 50% or so. Great buy for this price range!",5,1,2019-3-23,1,0,0
"I purchase  2 for my house party but if I get more than 4 ft away from the speaker with my phone it loses signal and it doesn't pay.

The speaker is great! It produces an amazing quality of sound for the size. Not to mention it is very durable! I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking into a portable speaker.,5,1,2019-11-1,1,0,0
"That a lot of sound comes out of a speaker this size isn't that big a deal - lots of small speakers are loud now. But the quality of that sound is second to none - that's a rarity. It has a fullness that you wouldn't expect from something this small. While certainly not the cheapest, you'll absolutely get a first rate product. Battery life is great too - especially if you listen at normal volumes. You won't regret getting this one !",5,1,2018-4-4,1,0,0
I bought this as an early Christmas gift for my husband. He's a truck driver and he always complains that he can't listen to the music on his phone because his work truck doesn't have an aux port and his cigarette lighter is broken. So I purchased this for him. It has great sound quality and he can hear it clearly over the sound of his engine. It's an all around great product!!,5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0

"This speaker sounds great, and is way louder than most of us need for daily use. It connects to my iPhone easily and is compatible.

Excellent value.",5,1,2019-1-12,1,0,0
"While it does connect to a device quickly I didn’t like the fact that the battery doesn’t actually last 12 hours, it doesn’t even last 8hrs. I bought this to take with me to work, but I’m disappointed that it doesn’t last my whole shift even if I charge it till it’s full capacity. The sound is good for its size, you can hear the music clearly and the bass goes well with the speaker. Good enough, but I’ll repeat again (as it was what made me buy this speaker in first place) it doesn’t last even 8hrs before the battery dies.",3,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
I'm a P.O. letter carrier and this is the perfect solution for listening to music in my truck or walking a route.  It's rugged and waterproof.  The sound is good and I usually only need half volume outside and a bit more inside the noisy truck.  The battery lasts me two full work days before I need to charge it.,5,1,2019-3-24,1,0,0
"Speaker is well built. Although it is decently loud, I expected a tad bit of more Bass for a JBL. Says 12 hours of play, but highly doub it, I fully charged it and played it for about 4 hours before it was less than half way. Overall I am happy with it and will be keeping it.",4,1,2019-3-30,1,1,0
About 5 months of use my Flip 4 wouldn’t connect to the charging cable. The charging port had become loose. I called JBL and e-mailed them a screenshot of my Amazon order and they emailed me back a UPS label for return. I got a new Flip 4 about 10 days later. I’m very pleased with the speaker and especially the customer service.,5,1,2019-2-18,1,0,0

"I expected more from this speaker. It has great sound as it is a step up from the JBL Flip 3. I had originally purchased the flip 3 and fell in love with it as soon as I began using it. The sound was a bit distorted when listening to certain songs on maximum volume. But after using it for only two days the distortion got worse with one song being particularly choppy and extremely distorted almost as if the sound was coming from a radio dispatch or a walkie talkie. I ended up returning it and upgrading to the Flip 4, which did live up to its expectations of having better sound. I haven't fully had the chance to test that out the battery life yet but I will give an update once that has happened. But one thing I am frustrated with is that I have only had the Flip 4 for about a week now and I just charged it once and the charger came apart! One use! For something so expensive I would have expected Better quality in the charger. The only reason I am not too upset is because I already have an extra android charger. That is out of luck. This should be fixed.",4,1,2017-5-25,1,2,1

"This is probobly the best mid range speaker of 2017, I love the sound quality, and the designs. The only bad thing is when unboxing it if you don't know what to expect the charger and manual may be thrown out, because they are kind of hidden in two smaller matte and glossy black boxes at the top and front of the inside of the box, but. Any thing aside from that is a 11 out of 10, the ipx7 waterproofing is amazing, it has a nice easy grip to it and a flawless design. I hoped this helped, and I say you should DEFINITELY buy this speaker",5,1,2018-1-12,1,1,0
The speaker itself is awesome but stopped working after being exposed to a small amount of water at the beach. We attempted to charge it a few days later and it’s still not working. Definitely would not recommend the speaker especially when they advertise it as being water proof.,2,1,2018-7-6,1,0,0

"Oh my goodness. Everyone needs one of these now. The battery life is amazing and the speaker quality is out of this world. We spend a lot of time outdoors, and the sound is still perfect.

"This product is amazingly waterproof. We went on a kayaking trip and tied the speaker off to the kayak. When I got out of the kayak I had no idea but the speaker went underwater, the music was stopped before the speaker went under so I really had no clue.

I don't know if I received a defective one (happened to me before) but the battery on this thing doesn't last 2 hours on low. this is my 3rd week with this speaker and I haven't even used it that frequently. I'm really disappointed with the battery life. I honestly believe this one is a defect because I've only charged it about 4 times since I received it... back to square one I guess. I hope the good people at JBL fix this issue if not for me at least for next buyer.",2,1,2017-8-2,1,1,0

"Coming from the flip 3 Iwasnt expecting anything to be crazy new. There is a complete difference in the build quality and battery life between the two. Flip 4 has great water resistance which is very convenient when at the pool playing some jams. Any music type sounds great and the mini ""sub woofers"" make for great bass.

Worked right out of the box - no problems connecting with my laptop at all.  The sound is good - not high quality like my Bose I have for personal use, but good.  Not quite the range of highs and lows as my Bose.  Powerful enough to be heard in any size classroom.

Speaking of volume, this thing gets LOUD without compromising quality.  You really get what you pay for here.

Excellent sounds quality for such a small unit. This thing gets hours and hours of play time and just keeps rocking. Built in base takes it over and above every other portable speaker out there. Jbl quality is top notch!,5,1,2019-4-22,1,0,0
"Speaker Lasted 18 months, despite buying a 4 year warranty Asurion is refusing to honor the same..wouldn’t recommend these products.. My speaker seems new, never exposed to water despite claiming to be water proof. Amazon should stand behind warranties bought through their web site, what’s the use of recommending warranty if the company doesn’t honor the same..I’m 67 and wouldn’t try to rip anyone off. If I but a warranty is to have peace of mind and be sure that the product last in good shape. Be careful about these products",1,1,2020-1-25,1,0,1
Loved this speaker good quality. I don’t use it everyday......sadly I didn’t realize the battery had a shelf life. I have a Sound Core that I alternate between.....had it longer and still works like it was new. Guess I will buy another SoundCore.,1,1,2020-4-15,1,1,0
Bought it to use while biking since it said its water proof and all. So far I like it nice and loud while riding and stayed firmly in my water bottle holder.,5,1,2017-12-13,1,3,1
So I read all the reviews about the people who have trouble being able to charge their Bluetooth speaker after a few charges. It's probably because they're stupid enough to keep the USB cord charging in the speaker while playing at the same time. Don't do that you idiots! I don't have a problem with charging my speakers because I don't do that. I love these speakers I'm glad I bought them and it's a great investment.,5,1,2018-12-5,1,0,0
"this speaker is awesome and loud! I got this for a few reasons, i drive locally in some older tractor trailers and there isnt any radios in most of our trucks so this is handy playing music from my phone also gonna zip tie it to the front of my can-am and jam while ill ride. i got the camo and the pattern is amazing. it also will connect to other speakers. i would recommend and would purchase again.",5,1,2018-5-19,1,0,1

I used this July 4th at a community fireworks party. This fireworks display in the past was set to music through large  stadium speakers. Last year that stopped.  I brought the JBL 4 speaker today programmed through my phone.  The whole street thought the music was from the stadium speakers but it was my JBL.  Great sound with perfect balance of highs and lows. This made experience with the fireworks that much more enjoyable. I highly recommend this speaker.,5,1,2019-7-5,1,0,0
"The JBL Flip 4 has great sound and works extremely well for the price. I like the ability to link several of them together. The JBL app for Android is pretty clunky, but not the worst I've seen.

"I bought this speaker shortly after my Dad had bought one and I found I was using it more than him because it was so fantastic! The two bass speakers on the side are pretty booming for its small, compact size. The quality of sound is more than a bang for your buck. The nice thing about this speaker is that it's water resistant, and can be charged and played at the same time (which wasn't possible with my old Sony speaker). Definitely an essential if you're a student who loves their music.",5,1,2017-8-31,1,1,0
The speaker works as described but there are some room for improvements. Battery life doesn’t last as long as stated when used at 80% volume it only last half.

This speaker is small but incredibly mighty. It is waterproof (i spilled something on it) and durable so far!The sound is high quality and at roughly 50% can be heard in my whole apartment.

I purchased the white jbl flip 4 as an upgrade to my old bicycle speaker. It has superior depth and bass compared to my old generic bike speaker.

Great speaker. Best in class as far as price amd size. It holds a charge for hours and fills a large indoor area really good.

The Bluetooth stays connected at a greater distance than my Bose Soundlink mini 2 did. The sound quality is good but does not have quite the bass as the Bose had but that can be a good thing because the Bose had far too much bass at times.

So just recently reserved the speaker and the first thing I could tell was how good the build quality was. Now going back to write this reword 2 days later after making the purchase I saw it was in sale and was almost $30 cheaper than when I bought it. So a little disappointed that I missed these. But over all a great speaker with wonderful highs and lows and a great bass,4,1,2017-7-26,1,2,0

"If you're buying a single one of these, then it's a great product, but if you're buying 2 in order to use them in stereo, they are pretty bad.

"I love JBL, I have their Xtreme speaker for when I'm working.  I needed a speaker for going to the beach and other occasions, when I don't need the ear shattering sound of the Xtreme, and boy did the flip deliver.

Awful broke within a week. The rubber ripped and now sound is crackled. Feel bad for my daughter that she said to buy and now can't use. Went to return but forgot about it and now past return window.

I believe it’s only a Built-in 3,000mAh rechargeable lithium ion battery supports up to 12 hours of playtime at moderate volume levels but they need like a 5200 mAh to get like 7/8 hours if your out with out a charger, say like camping.",3,1,2018-3-12,1,3,0

"This speaker is great. I needed a 2 speaker setup for work and home use, where one would sit on my toolbox while a second would travel around in a service cart with me. I had considered MiniRig due to hifi sound quality, size, unlimited daisy chaining, great app options and dedicated subwoofer but ultimately the lack of play/pause/volume buttons on the speakers as well as price drove me away. I decided to try one of these, and just ordered a second now that I have checked sound quality. JBL told me if the speakers time out when connected (if you have media not playing for example), they will lose their link and you will have to reconnect them. I had trouble finding that information and had to call, so hopefully it helps someone else. JBL said they would implement this feature in the future where they would relink on power up, this would open up options of having full room wireless setups semi-permanently arranged, would not have to pick them all up and connect every time. I will chime back in here with comments once I've thoroughly tested using 2 of them at once, in and outside of work.Pros:",5,1,2018-5-27,1,1,0

works perfectly. What I want from a speaker is the sound clarity. The sound is definitely clearer than 20-50$ options if that's what you're looking for but I don't know if you'd be happier with other options or not because this is my first purchase of a bluetooth speaker.

"I needed a small, bluetooth enabled speaker with good range that is well priced, sounds good and has decent battery life. This did the trick. Ive had it a couple of months with no complaints. Since I do not use it outside I cannot speak to its water resistant capabilities however it is doubtful I would take it with me on a shark diving tour or to a tropical beach excursion during monsoon season. On the other hand; if you do choose to take it with you on what is billed as a three hour tour and become lost at sea then I suppose the red Flip could be used a signal buoy. I am fairly certain that is why jbl offers one in that color. The lanyard is a nice touch, makes transportation from here to there more convenient if you have tiny hands and cannot grasp the speaker itself. I did not try the jbl connect app. Stopped dead in my tracks upon reading the eula where it says google analytics will manage data collected by the app, plus you have to allow the app to know your location. Why does anyone need to know my location as a condition for modifying settings on the Flip and what ""analytics"" are collected by goozle? If you're looking for comments regarding sound quality or comparisons then you will find several good amazon reviews that cover those points.",4,1,2018-3-3,1,1,0

I will never buy a brand new JBL speaker from a store again after this purchase. This is the same as brand new for half the money. I have two other JBL speakers and I assure you all the packaging was factory and looked just the same as the ones I opened brand new.

Mind you, I bought this brand new. It connects and, I kid you not, the connection was so horrible I could not walk two feet without the music cutting in and out. I put my phone right next to the speaker and IT STILL CUT OFF. It was the most annoying thing ever. Regardless if this one speaker was defective or if the entire JBL Flip 4 models are defective, this is unacceptable. JBL has enough money to make quality speakers. Definitely disappointed, but the good news is I will pay a little more and take my business to Bose.",1,1,2018-7-27,1,3,0
The sound quality is second to none! It is amazing the quality of sound this little speaker put out. We turned it on in our backyard and you could hear it perfectly in our front yard. I highly recommend this speaker!!,5,1,2018-4-10,1,0,0
I don’t know what happened but it’s less than 3 months and now my JBL Flip 4 no longer works. Suddenly after turning it off yesterday it no longer works. I’m sad because I was so happy with it’s performance. Please replace it.,1,1,2017-12-5,1,1,0
I’m so upset! This was a big purchase for me and I can only use it when it’s plugged in. It will not charge completely but will okay when it is plugged in. This is NOT what I expected when I spent close to $80 on a blue tooth speaker.,1,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0

"The device, as far as sound quality and construction goes, is flawless. Sounds a lot better than I have imagined, loud, crisp and with enough bass without being way too much (some other speakers I found them poorly balanced, with too much bass).This being said, there is one thing that managed to really really bothered me, after owning this speaker for several months, and even makes me want to sell it sometimes: Each time the speaker turns on, turns off, or connects to a device, it plays REALLY loud sounds. Really loud sounds you cannot change nor disable. A really poor design decision that makes me think twice before considering buying another JBL speaker. I would recommend you to watch video reviews to listen to the sound and evaluate yourself if you want to wake up your family or neighbors every time you turn on your speaker at 2AM.",3,1,2017-10-14,1,3,0

It worked right out of the box and second time using it it wouldn’t power. Lights come on when plugged in but that is all. Sounds like a normal problem with these. Won’t be buying another one. Sound was good when it worked.,1,1,2018-6-24,1,0,0
