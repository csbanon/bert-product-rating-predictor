"Received my AirPods Pro a couple of days ago and have been using them day and night since. I also have the new Bose 700's, which I've been using daily for a couple of months so I'll compare to them.I commute each day on a noisy city bus. Sometimes there are people talking and sometimes there's nothing but the loud noises of the bus. The Bose headphones are not sweat or weatherproof, and so are not useful outside unless the skies are clear. With winter coming, the Bose also prevent wearing a winter hat, so I decided to buy the Air Pods for use in commuting and then use the Bose once I get to my desk at work.",5,1,2019-11-6,1,1,1
"So, they don‚Äôt come with a charging cable that can actually be used‚Äîso don‚Äôt forget to buy one. That kind of sucks. Since I can‚Äôt use them, overall review... yeah... 1 star. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1,1,2019-11-12,1,1,0

"I thought they were pretty nice at first. Sound quality is good. They charged quick in the case. But transparency mode amplified sounds like crazy. At the gym someone was moving weights, the cling of them hitting was so loud it hurt my ears. When I took the airpods out it was much quieter in real life. Even in noise cancelling mode they pick up voices and then they end up sounding robotic. There's a white noise in the background too. It's like a little static, annoying as hell.Just now I started hearing a popping noise in the right bud. It kept happening even when the music was off. When I turned to transparency mode that popping became a buzz.",1,1,2019-11-18,1,1,0
"Apple AirPods Pro is one of the best noice cancelling in-ear headphones available in market. Price is on the upper end but the quality is also on the upper side compared to other models.I have QC35 and the noise canceling is comparatively good but being in-ear, the listening experience is much better.",5,1,2019-11-10,1,1,1

"If you‚Äôre thinking about these and currently own the original style of AirPods, please check out my review below!Are these a replacement to the original AirPods? Not necessarily. I own these and two original style AirPods. I am an Apple fan girl and own one of everything they‚Äôve got. But even then, I‚Äôm on the fence about the Pro‚Äôs. First off...",4,1,2019-11-26,1,8,0
So uncomfortable to wear... to make the noise canceling effective I have to shove the rubber tip into my ear which starts to hurt my hear. I have to sit absolutely still otherwise they begin to lose the seal required to get ANC. I have tried all 3 sizes too. They fall out of my ear in the gym. People are just high on apple.Sound quality is laughable. The most over hyped piece of garbage.,1,1,2019-11-21,1,8,0

"As someone who can‚Äôt use standard AirPods because they hurt my ears, I‚Äôve been thrilled so far with the AirPods Pro. The adjustable fit is great and they are very comfortable. Sound is incredible considering their small size (even smaller than the standard AirPods!). I‚Äôve tried lots of competitors such as the Jabra Elite 65‚Äôs but these are smaller, better, and more seamless than anything I‚Äôve tried. Very happy so far",5,1,2019-11-3,1,1,0
Bought these for a Christmas present for my wife.  Could not believe it does not come with  a wall plug to fit the other end of the lighting plug.  The end that plugs into the AirPods is a standard lightning plug.  The wall end IS NOT a standard USB plug..  it is a USB C plug???? This apple product does not include the wall plug for this to work.  So we are charging our $299 air pods with our IPhone charger.An Apple gimmick to sell something else that should be included in the initial purchase.  What do people do that do not have another Apple produce to do double duty as a charger.,1,1,2019-12-28,1,1,0

"I wish I could give more than five stars. I‚Äôm a very picky person when it comes to what sounds are flooding my ears and I tell you, I‚Äôve owned Bose and thought those were the game changers. I was more than pleasantly surprised at how these sound and fit. I‚Äôve never used any Apple products in my ears, especially with the price of Apple nowadays. These are hands down the best ear buds I‚Äôve ever owned! They stay perfectly in place through some rigorous working out as well!",5,1,2019-11-4,1,1,0
"UPDATE: These are literally designed to have a short lifespan. There is no way to fully discharge the batteries from both the case and the pods as the pods do not work if the case is dead, although they work without the case if you had already started using them. This is to depreciate the lifespan on the product itself. With lithium ion batteries you need to fully discharge between charges for the best battery life. Seems like Apple has designed these in a manner where you actually can‚Äôt do so. Pathetic.I really didn‚Äôt have crazy expectations for these but they‚Äôve let me down in every way.",1,1,2020-1-9,1,1,0
"I know this will probably sound unbelievable but the box came without the actual airpods inside.

"Noise cancelling means tight fit - that achieved with soft silicon tips. Even with pressure regulators for equalizing internal and external pressure  the tight fit is uncomfortable, sounds travel through you body and you hear low frequency impact every time you make a step.

"Wow! I never liked the original air pods. They always fell off. I‚Äôm so glad Apple came out with these and that I waited to splurge on headphones. The sound is beautiful, the fit is perfect.

"So I will say I'm never wearing my bose 700's out in public (other than planes and other modes of transport that are too loud for the small in ear noise cancelation the Airpods pro have) there just too bulky and, but these new airpods are just so sleek and convenient, I'm an audio nerd if you want convenience these are probably the best buds to buy right now. Obviously sound could be better but for what you get I'd say it's worth every penny.Seif Afyouni.",5,1,2019-11-2,1,3,0
I‚Äôm gonna start off saying that the noise canceling is amazing ide rate 10/10. Where the problem is is after wear for 3 minutes it begins to hurt my ears dramatically. I tried every tip and none of them work. It seems to be the design of the earbud itself. I‚Äôve personally loved all of apples products but I think they should have worked a little harder on this one. I‚Äôve done research and I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing pain. There is thousands who say the same thing. The original AirPods are great and feel amazing in my ears where sometimes I forget I‚Äôm wearing them. If you have normal AirPods I would say your better off just using them.,1,1,2019-11-13,1,2,0
"I got these as a pre-order on amazon, and when they arrived I instantly began to love them. Now you may think im weird for using these with my google pixel 3, but I have tried samsung gear iconx and jaybirds x3 in the past, and neither were a suitable option for me, despite their good passive noise cancellation. I love the active noise cancellation on these airpods, and it makes tasks such as leave blowing and other loud low tone things much more tolerable.!!!!!ANDROID COMPATABILITY!!!!!!",5,1,2019-11-12,1,1,0
"Should have listen to the other reviews, I'm beyond embarrassed. I bought these as a gift for my brother in law and these turned out to be FAKE.

Double check your airpods. Mine did not come with the Apple plastic wrapping and came with scotch tape and the case and airpods themselves had clearly been used. Had to return them and now I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll get new ones.,1,1,2020-1-2,1,1,0

"Whatever my studio speakers and pro headphones sound, they sound. I have no problems at all so far. They stay in my ears without problem.These sound really good. The highs, mids, and bass are all really defined and don‚Äôt blend like on other pricey earbuds/phones. The sound cuts and every instrument can be heard at all times. can‚Äôt hear anything at the gym. I enjoyed the music very much!",5,1,2019-12-17,1,1,1

The Pros are so much better than previous Airpods:-  Fit:  The small pads that come with the Pro fit perfectly and don't budge even when running. The default size of the old Airpods were too big for my ears and they were always falling out.,5,1,2019-11-12,1,8,0
Hello so I‚Äôm coming from air pods 2. I guess sweat got into it or light rain got into but I had to sell those because they started to mess up on me..Apple doesn‚Äôt say they are sweat proof or any IP rating so I guess that‚Äôs my fault. The fit was perfect they never feel off and I loved them.Now I‚Äôve tried a lot of different types but they would all fall off true wireless ones. I said the hell wit them and I went for air pods pro because of familiarity and IP rating.,4,1,2020-1-13,1,8,0
"I've been searching for the right earbuds/headphones for the last 5 months, running the gamut from cheap to expensive.  Some of the cheaper buds sounded good, but in order to get good sound, you had to have the perfect seal.  In my case, the seal would be fine until I moved around, then the buds would work their way out of my ears just enough to render the bass response useless. One the ear headphones like the Bose and Sonys sound terrific with good NC, but my ears would get warm.  Cheaper headphones didn't have solid NC and most times felt like my head was in a vice after 30 minutes.Apple has created the perfect listening device.  NC is phenomenal and the sound, while not comparable to big cans is remarkable with solid bass.  The ear fit test is brilliant and works perfectly.  It determined I needed a different tip for my right ear.  And to top it off, these buds are so comfortable (like the regular AirPods), you don't even notice they're in your ears.",5,1,2019-11-14,1,5,0
"I watched all YouTube videos, reviews, unboxing, and find this perfect price on Amazon, but after using 1-2 hours i keep moving the AirPods because it Really hurts my ear canal and inside of the ear, pain feels even after i took them off. I own the Airpods 1, which i sometimes  forget that I‚Äôm wearing  on. Long story short - I end up returning. I don‚Äôt want talk about sound quality, noise cancellation and another features, because you are going to get ear fatigue after hours",1,1,2019-11-25,1,6,0
Looks like a knock-off. The touch functionality doesn't work at all and the box didn't even come with a wall adapter and I paid almost $300 for this?UPDATE - right airpod stopped working. 100% a knock-off. DO NOT BUY.,1,1,2019-11-14,1,1,0

"$250!? More like $300+ since you have to provide your own charging brick, they only include a USB-C to Lightning cable and all the other accessories you have to buy to get them to stay put. - Read on for more.The AirPod Pro true failure is their inability to stay in my ears! I have had multiple earphones before with no issues. They  start out okay, do the fit test and get the green check mark but literally a second later I turn my head and out they pop. The Beats X fit perfectly and have many interchangeable sizes that actually stay put. The Bose SoundSport Free has amazing staying power. Why Apple didn't use the tips of the Beats or even some memory foam ones baffles me. As a work around I found these anti-slip silicone covers and they help but not enough and for $250 I shouldn't have to spend another $15 to help them stay in my ear somewhat better.",3,1,2020-5-19,1,4,0

"I really want to love these, but I always go back to using my regular Airpods or Bose QuietComfort.  The primary issue for me is that they do not stay in my ears and I am constantly having to push them back in, which is extremely annoying.  I have tried all the different bud versions, but none of them work for me.I hate having to carry two different differents, but I found the following combination to work the best for me.",3,1,2020-4-5,1,5,0
"Used for about a week and then found the left bud battery drained overnight. Sent for replacement for about two weeks. Right now I still did not get it back. Do me a favor stay away from this product, the quality is sooooooo bad!",1,1,2019-12-2,1,9,0
"I've ben using these AirPods pro earbuds for 2 weeks now. These are the best of the 5 different pairs of high-end earbuds I own. However, to make them  work for my ears, I upgraded the ear tips to foam.  The included silicone tips kept falling our of my ears, and I tried all 3 sizes.  On Saturday the left ear fell out 3x on my 2 mile walk. So - I found an upgrade offered by an eBay seller that includes foam tips with a clip that replaces the apple silicone tips.The foam works like a charm. Not only do they fit great in my ears, they don't fall out , and fit easily in the original charging case.  The bass and highs are now both cleaner and crisper..  Apple should revisit using foam similar to the comply tips.",5,1,2020-1-13,1,4,0
"I bought these to help block out distracting office noise.  Unfortunately (and ironically), the noise cancelling algorithm on these actually make the distractions worse.  The AirPods Pro removes the white noise that had been masking conversations and abrupt sounds.  With them in, it's actually harder to concentrate.  I truly hope the magicians at Apple can improve the noise cancellation program via firmware update.  It is not in the same league as Bose and Sony at this point.  It is also not as customizable.As far as sound quality goes, I had been scared by other reviewers into thinking these were absolute garbage.  I'm happy to say that's not the case.  They are generally balanced and pleasant to listen to.  The bass is present but not over-accentuated.  The mids and highs are also present but not irritating.  It's close to being good.  There are better options out there, obviously.  My favorite pair of wireless ears is the Bose SoundSport Wireless, which is, by the way, cheaper and more appropriate for working out.  Apple's sound should have a bit more low frequency extension and more customizability.  By the way, having a good tight fit in crucial to achieving proper low-end response on any in-ear headphone.  So if the bass sounds weak to you, try a bigger tip and make sure to push it in snugly!",4,1,2019-11-14,1,3,0
"So, I got a pair the day after they were released for the first time. When I put them on the noise cancelation felt magical. Unfortunately my dog chewed them up two weeks later. Fast forward to last week, when I finally bit the bullet and spent the crazy amount of money on a new pair. For some reason they just didn‚Äôt sound the same. A few days ago, I finally came across an article talking about the firmware updates. Apparently, This is something that happens automatically and Apple really botched it. It‚Äôs completely destroyed the noice cancelling capabilities and once it is updated it can‚Äôt go back. I‚Äôve lost all trust in Apple for keeping this quiet and refusing to rectify the situation or address it in any way.",2,1,2020-4-17,1,6,0
"Sound quality and the noise cancelation feature are decent, nothing like Bose though. My main issue is the fit. They just fling out randomly while you are on the go or working out. I have tried all of the different ear buds provided by Apple but in vain. The price is very high compared to what you get. There are better options in the market for this price.",1,1,2019-11-18,1,6,0
"Charging box came broken, visible dent and damaged hinge...quality control questionable.Actual working life on one charge not impressive, not practical to carry charging box around....if You need to use them, product has quality sound and very good noise cancellation with pretty short life - 4 hrs new.",1,1,2019-11-11,1,6,0
"I really like the old air pods and have bought a few for my family, also used them everyday for 8+ hours straight  without any problem. Although the new air pods pro cost more and sounds great with some extra features, I don't think it's for me. If I use it for less than two hours or so there won't be any problems as it preforms very well. The main problem is that if I wear them for over 2+ hours they start to hurt both my ear which is weird because the older models ""wired/wireless"" I have no problem with while they are in my ear all day long. ""I have tried changing the rubber from large to small still doesn't help."" It seems like the new design are a little thicker than the older generations. Also a minor problem I have is taking them out which doesn't bother that much. So I would advise testing them out at least 2-4 hours to see if they are for you before keeping it. Overall they look and sounds great.",3,1,2019-11-10,1,5,0

"Apple hit a home run with these... I wanted the original AirPods but couldn't get them to fit in my ear. I have tried other true wireless earbuds and never liked the look or fit of them. With the AirPods Pro, Apple has answered my prayers, and they're even better than I could have imagined. The sound cancellation is LEGIT. I own the Bose 700 noise canceling headphones and while they're not as good at noise cancellation as those, I'm blown away by how close it is.The sound quality as well sounds very good to me. I'm by no means an audiophile but I'm a little picky as far as this goes and I'm more than pleased.",5,1,2019-11-2,1,4,0
"Sound isolation and water resistance are my favorite features! Was super blown away by how it silences a lot of the noise around me until transparency mode is active!If you want louder headphones than the previous, these are definitely NOT it.",5,1,2019-11-2,1,4,0
I really wanted to love these but they simply do not stay in the ear. Tried all three tip sizes and no luck. The sound and noise cancelation is good but so far this is useless to me.,1,1,2019-11-21,1,4,0
"I bought a pair of these after Xmas. It took over a week to get here but I thought ok they are from Warehouse and its worth it. Maybe someone got them as a gift and returned them new.

It was defective.This is the 2nd time I have bought Apple products from amazon that were problematic. That were ""inspected"". Just buy from Apple. They have a great return policy and if they are ""refurbished"" from Apple- the quality is the same as a new product. Whereas here if you buy from the Amazon Warehouse- most likely they have an issue.",1,1,2020-1-4,1,2,0
Pre-ordered from Costco day they were available to. Was very excited until I actually received them. Sound quality is average at best and battery life leaves A LOT to be desired. As with most apple products they appear to be designed by a child but was willing to overlook that if functionality was on par with the price. It wasn't so returned 2 days later and bought the top of the line Sony version for about the same price and couldn't be happier! No more apple products for me and will be buying elsewhere from now on...,2,0,2019-11-2,1,3,0
They work great for about two weeks. Then the left one just went completely unresponsive even though my phone still shows that it‚Äôs on and charged. Even with buying Applecare Apple refuses to send me out a whole new set and will only send me the left replacement airpod after I spend half a day driving an hour away from my house to the only Apple store around here.

"Pairs immediately with nice controls. Did not keep long enough to evaluate battery life. Problem is the sound quality is OK, but not what you'd expect for $250. The first generation airpod sound quality is EXCELLENT. The second generation was terrible. Now this third generation is better then the second generation, but nowhere near as good as the first generation. I returned this third generation and went back and bought two used first generation airpods while they are still available. I figure there might never be another airpod that matches it.Also, the noise cancellation is worthless. This is not too surprising. It's really hard to do any serious noise cancellation without over-the-ear coverage.",2,1,2019-11-8,1,3,0

"I'm sorry I bought the new AirPods Pro.  I have owned the original AirPods for years.  I wore the originals almost constantly and honestly can only remember once that they came out of my ear.  I just never worried about them.  This is NOT the case with the new Pro.  They fall out of my ear everyday and many time more than once a day.  I mean you bend over to pick something up and they are likely to fall out.  I have tried all three ear bud sizes that come with the Pro, and while the new design looks like it would be better beware, they fall out!  Sick with the original AirPods!The sound of the Pro is great!  The new noise cancelation is excellent.  The battery life seems to be a bit better than the original and I really like the ability to pause the playback by touching the Pro.  (If only they stayed in my ear! )",2,1,2019-11-15,1,2,0

Best earbuds I‚Äôve ever purchased. For years I wanted wireless noice canceling earbuds after using the beats studios and Bose qc lines. Being an iPhone user I always saw the appeal of AirPods but never could use them due to them not fitting my ear correctly and always falling out. As soon as I saw the design of the AirPods pro I instantly came to amazon and ordered them. If you‚Äôre at all contemplating on ordering these I 100% recommend. The noice cancelling is slightly above average and the transparency mode is extremely useful on the go or whenever you need to hear your surroundings with your music. Amazing product definitely worth the steep 250 dollars,5,1,2019-11-3,1,2,0
"I was very excited to try the new Airpods Pro, but unfortunately they are not for me. The main issue was the active noise cancellation (ANC). These were the first pair of ANC headphones I've owned, and it seems that I am in the minority of people who experience a strong negative reaction to ANC. Within moments of turning it on, I experienced head pressure, mild headache, and mild nausea. If you have never used ANC headphones before, be aware that the experience may not be as comfortable or magical as other say. Here is a breakdown of my thoughts on these Airpods:The Good:",2,1,2019-11-14,1,2,0
"FAKESSSS!!!! I bought mine a couple of months back and upon opening, they looked a bit used (there was black stuff in the crevices of the button on the case and on the airpods themselves) but I decided to give Amazon the benefit of the doubt...WRONG MOVE!!!! I have not given them significant use (I preferred using my regular earbuds because it became more convenient in EVERY sense) but they have been cutting off and now its gotten to the point where the left one completely stopped working. Nothing plays on it. The other one (the right one) sounds subpar. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY GO TO APPLE DIRECTLY!!! I am EXTREMELY disappointed in amazon. I should've listened to the previous reviews saying they weren‚Äôt authentic and they arrived used. DO. NOT. BUY!!",1,1,2020-4-1,1,2,0
"I really wanted to like these. I thought the audio quality of the original AirPods was great, especially if you held them snug in your ear. With the new design, I was hoping the seal would produce the same effect, ensuring high quality sound under all conditions. While they are comfortable and have excellent noise cancellation, I would almost go as far to say the sound quality is the same or worse than the original model. Maybe mine were defective; but, all of my music sounded crisp on the high end and peripherals, while feeling completely empty in the center. It is almost like Apple included an artificial surround enhancer or DSP, by default. Regardless, with the $250 price tag, I was told to expect better. Yes, there are new features and a new design; they are pretty and interface seamlessly with your iPhone. However, if sound quality is your primary concern, I would look elsewhere, or stick with what you have.",3,1,2019-11-14,1,1,0
Sound quality is amazing. However the battery life could be better. AirPods last about 3 hours with noise canceling. The dock hold a great charge and easily recharge the AirPods more then 5 times. Just a little inconvenient if you use them constantly.,5,1,2020-5-31,1,1,0
"As an owner of the 1st gen and 2nd gen AirPods I can honestly say these are worthy of the upgrade.  The ear tips are much more comfortable than I imagined they would be for extended wearing and also hold them in place.  With older AirPods design they would fit but when moving around and even just talking (moving your jaw) they would wriggle from their set position.  Also, I didn't care for the loud sound pressure transferred to your eardrum when tapping to issue commands either of the older generation units.  These new Pro model buds have a pressure sensor on each bud stem you press/pinch to activate features.  They make little single click/tick sound when pressed. One press for Play/Pause/Answer/Hangup, Two-presses for next track, Three-presses for previous track. So far the best feature is noise cancellation which is fantastic.  Calgon, take me a away. The peacefulness is bliss.  The only nag I have so far is with the shorter stem they can be a little fumbly putting them into and getting them out of the charging case.  I haven't had them long enough to test call-quality (both audio and microphone quality) but will update if anything comes up.  I did make sure the firmware updated to latest version as I've heard others speak of microphone call quality with original/shipping firmware version, so I am interested to see if this new version resolves it.  All in all I can highly recommend them and will come back and either bump rating to 5 stars or keep it at 4Update ~6 month (04/17/2020). Still at 4-stars. All in all a decent upgrade over Gen 2 AirPods and best wireless buds out there I think. Still some software/firmware bugs requiring to put back in case or reset and repairing them to get them working again. Also, microphone voice quality is horrible. On par with gen1 and gen2 AirPods and this is one of the major items I hope Apple targets for the next model(s). Mic noise cancellation is pretty good but voice quality is just lacking. Some would call fidelity of the microphones very compressed and tinny. If you can pick these up for 235+tax they are a decent deal. If they‚Äôd get to 199+tax it would be much better.  I still highly recommend them.",4,1,2019-11-25,1,6,0
"Received fake AirPods without the charging cable or any accessories. How do I know they we‚Äôre fake?

"These worked fine for a month or two, but then a crackling noise began in the left airpod. Everytime I move and occasionally even when staying completely still distracting noise will begin. For a top-of-the-line pair of earbuds these are surprisingly flimsy. They were serving their purpose but two months of regular use before breaking is unacceptable.As a side note, don't expect these to cancel out sound. They'll dull the ambient noise; if a TV is on in the background you'll hear it clearly.",1,1,2020-1-10,1,7,0
"I have only had these for 1 day and I am debating whether or not to return them. I have had every generation of the airpods (e.g. Airpods 1 and Airpods 2). Why did I get these? Well, because I lost my previous Airpods and I was intrigued by the anti-sweat claims of this product. However, I am on the fence as to whether to return them because after about 30 minutes of a hard run, the silicon tips kept coming out. Every time I would try to push them back in it was awkward because I was running fast. What's more, each time I tried to readjust the tips and jam them into my canal (imagine me doing this running a 6:30 mile), I kept hitting the button on the stem and stopping/the music. For the last 10 minutes of my run I just threw the airpods into the treadmill cup. I am now trying smaller buds in hopes that they will work. I will say that the noise cancellation and the transparency mode is amazing. The speaker and sound is superb. But that won't mean much if my main use case (running with these on at high speeds and with lots of sweat) doesn't work. I will update this review in a week or so.UPDATE: I am definitely returning these. The first Apple product that I am extremely disappointed in. The left Airpod fell out multiple times during my run yesterday at high intensity. What is more, the Airpod has started emitting a high-pitched squeak/squeal sound. You can do a Google search on this and many users have complained of this. It appears to be related to the noise cancelling feature and there is definitely a design flaw. I'm disappointed and will be going back to the Airpods 2. I really wanted to these to work, but for serious runners, I would look elsewhere.",1,1,2020-4-26,1,4,0

Unfortunately, she has smaller ears, so the largeness of the white plastic piece, not the interchangeable silicone pieces, feels uncomfortable after short term usage. Even for me, the largeness of the ear bud starts to feel uncomfortable after an hour or so. They at least stay in when exercising.The noise canceling helps but doesn‚Äôt completely block out external noise.

One forum said it‚Äôs likely mic feedback from the noise canceling.",3,1,2019-12-4,1,5,1
"I was hesitant to purchase these, becasue there wasn't data to support how many decibels the noise cancellation actually cancels. I still don't know how much it cancels out, but I love them! I wear them when driving a no cab JD 4010 tractor wide open. It blocks most of the tractor noise out, and I don't even have to have the volume turned up high. I also wear them while driving the skid steer. It does a great job of blocking out the back ground noise. If someone calls me while on a very loud tractor, I can hear them great, but they have trouble hearing me, which is totally understandable. I can have conversations with people while in the skid steer. The skid steer doesn't run too loud that people can't hear me during conversation.These airpods are very handy. I work in construction, and it is very convenient to be able to walk around the job site and talk on the phone without having to have my phone in my hand. Another great benefit is that I can leave my phone on the charger and walk around my house talking to someone on the phone. I also wear them while walking or jogging. I live in the country and don't have side walks to walk on. I walk/jog down the road. Even with the noise cancellation I can still hear most all vehicles when they are coming from behind. I've only been startled a few times.",5,1,2020-7-5,1,3,0
"This product is not really an apple product and if you purchased apple care with it, you won't be able to use it.I thought I got a great deal on these earpods because they were $20 cheaper than the apple store. Less than a week after purchasing them, the noise cancellation feature stopped working and I kept hearing a wooshing sound and I can tell the equilibrium was not working properly in both earpods. Additionally, the noise cancellation feature would randomly stop working. I took them to the apple store to fix them and they told me that these are actually fake and showed me how the apple database does not recognize them. I asked how I was able to purchase apple care on a fake product and they informed me that the apple care was purchased for a single set of airpods and the serial number was printed on all of the airpods being sold. This is infuriating but I have learned my lesson to only purchase Apple products from the Apple store.",1,1,2020-7-28,1,5,0
I am very happily pleased with this purchase. I bought these to replace my Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless headphones. The noise cancellation is amazing. It works so well. The supplied ear tips make sure that these stay in my ears and don‚Äôt move around. The sound is less bass heavy than the Sennheiser but in a good way. It seamlessly transitions between my Apple devices. Highly recommended.,5,1,2019-11-6,1,6,0
"Sounds quality is maybe on par with the regular AirPods. The sub-bass is non-existent and the low-end in general is absolutely anemic.The Noise Cancellation was pretty good until they updated it and made it almost useless. You can still hear almost everything when ANC is activated now, it had no problem drowning out car noises on the first firmware. Why Apple would willingly choose to nerf their product and not release an update to fix it almost a month later shows that these are absolutely not ready for market. If you want to waste $250 to be a market tester for some not-so-great sounding headphones, this is for you. Everyone else just avoid them and stick to the standards or another brand altogether like the Sony WF-1000XM3's for better sound and Noise Cancellation",1,1,2020-1-22,1,4,0

"I have experienced and still own quite a few over the ear, in ear and true wireless headphones and buds. UE Custom, Jabra 75t and a few others are still in use. I owned the original Air Pods and ended up giving those to my wife as I found useless for a number of reasons. I picked up the Air Pod Pro's and I am absolutely impressed. I have a lot of adjustable light switches around my house and the H1 chip keeps the connection without a blimp. When my wife is home, I use earbuds (sometimes Plantronics that a waterproof that go's around my neck and sometimes the Jabra Sport 65t), I have even used the Jabra 75t and Air Pod Pro's while taking a shower. With every truly wireless earbud the connection breaks up due to the adjustable light switches in my bathroom. If I use the Air Pod Pro's the connection is as solid as using earbuds that fit around the neck.Now as far as sound. As I mentioned I have too many listening devices to list. But all of my over ear are fabulous sounding and most to my ears add little coloration or take away from the music. Even my entry level UE when I connect them directly to my iPhone or use bluetooth are really pleasing to me. Since purchasing the Air Pod Pro's I've had to purchase another set for backup. The functionality of the Air Pod Pro's with my iPhone are second to none. I've listened in every mode, noise cancelling, transparency and neither and these things just sound good to me. They let the music come through for me. I've read reviews by professional reviewers and they almost always say that when it comes to the music they're just mediocre, well to my ears, that's not true. I own some of the devices they claim sound much better. I don't own several like Sony earbuds the 1000 series, and Bose I sent back. To me the Bose are over rated. Sennheiser I wouldn't purchase another pair because of poor service, no, no service with a high end pair of connected over the ear set.",5,1,2020-6-2,1,2,0
"Previously, I owned the first generation of the airpods and was very happy with them. I was forced to buy this pair because my dog chewed up the left earphone of my first pair. In the new pair, the battery life is excellent and the sound quality is as good as any in ear headphone I have tried. I also really like the method for playing and pausing audio which is just squeezing the bottom of the headphone.The new noise cancellation feature is my biggest grievance. After 3 months of use, the headphones now crackle when I'm using either transparency or noise cancellation mode. The crackling increases dramatically whenever I talk. If I turn off noise cancellation and transparency, then the headphones stop crackling. Pretty disappointing for such expensive headphones.",3,1,2020-6-9,1,3,0

"I'm sitting here kind of chuckling to myself. I went from being AMAZED at the Pro's (although if they slightly slip out of your ear, ANC goes to crap), and loving every second of using them, to feeling like they're a burden and not worth putting in.Long story short, after ~4 months of bliss, the right Airpod has been malfunctioning. It sounds like the microphones that are used for ANC (or one of the other mics) is actually picking up reverberations from inside the earpiece, and causing massive amounts of feedback. Apple should be covering it by warranty, so I'm hesitant to leave such a bad review, but it feels like such a silly design flaw.",2,1,2020-6-5,1,2,0

"I really wanted to like these noise-canceling earbuds. I am completely in the Apple universe, and these seemed like the perfect way to upgrade my headphone experience. The connectivity was wonderful, with the AirPods automatically connecting to the last Apple device you were connected to immediately after taking them out of the charging case. Sound quality was great for music, podcasts, and calls, and the microphone was wonderful for calls too. Noise cancellation was really good for these (obviously) not being over-ear headphones. The battery life was somewhat disappointing, although not worse that what was spec‚Äôd. Sure, you get plenty of hours with the charging case, but the AirPods themselves only last 4-5 hours.All that said, I had to return my AirPods after just one week. I have never had any issues with any earbuds fitting my ear, but these would literally cause pain after just 15-20 minutes. I was really hoping that I would get used to them after a week, but the pain only got worse. My ears would feel really sore after a day of using these.",3,1,2020-4-22,1,3,0
"Where else would they squeeze their margins- they are at the point of cutting quality control which they sorely need. I‚Äôm disappointed to open a sealed box from Apple, a luxury brand, to find that the case is wobbling and the earbuds are misaligned where it was glued/bonded with dirt already trapped inside. The sound is improved due to insulation and the noise cancellation is impressive for what they are- small earbuds. However, I expect more for this price point from from an ‚Äúelite‚Äù brand. Apple was once my favorite brand for all things they produce, and now all things have been gradually going down hill. These hit a breaking point where I will be returning them.",2,1,2019-12-3,1,4,0

Bummer, but as a paralegal I had those things in ALL day, every day, and I‚Äôd never had a pair of headphones last me that long before.Naturally I was VERY excited to get these, knew they‚Äôd be worth the money, and was excited for all the new features.",1,1,2020-8-11,1,3,0
"The noise cancellation isn't the greatest. Of course, our expectations for the noise cancellation won't be similar to Sony's  wh-1000xm3 be we should expect it to be pretty decent right? It's not. People have had concerns about the if listeners would hear a car or train coming up behind them but listeners have nothing to fear. In a relatively quiet room, the noise cancellation sounds great. Any fans, AC noise, etc is canceled out. However, once you start going about your day, outside noises can still be heard while having the volume 2/3 of the way up.Now that is assuming that the pros are able to stay in your ear.

I was ""okay"" with the Airpods 2 but the fit left much to be desired (my ears hurt after listening for any length of time and they had a tendency to fall out). The fit on the Pros are EXCELLENT (I use the Medium tips). The sound quality is light years better (due, no doubt, to the better ""sealed fit"" and to the two new Modes).

"Not worth the money.  Very disappointed in the noise cancellation.  I‚Äôve worn these on a plane and they only cancel out about 60% of the engine noise.  I occasionally work in a large data center where there‚Äôs a consistent equipment hum of about 84 decibels, and I estimate that these are only blocking out about 75% of the noise.  The noise cancellation software needs some serious updating.  The sound transparency mode is pretty good so that you can hear people talking and sounds around you.  There‚Äôs just a slight filtering of the sound, so it‚Äôs not completely transparent.  Good enough to leave the EarPods in and still hear what‚Äôs going on around you.The BIG downside to these are that the EASILY fall out!!  I‚Äôve tried the different sized ear tips, and ran the Air Pods Pro sound/noise cancellation tests and I‚Äôm using the correct size tips.  On a plane, I nodded off for a bit and woke up to a missing AirPod.  I had to wait until the plane landed and everyone got off to search for the AirPod.  It rolled a few rows back winding up under a seat with a bunch of garbage and dirt.  On a return trip, I put them in, and within 5 minutes, one fell out again.  Forget about moving around with them in, as they will definitely fall out.  If you bend over, they fall out.  You will find yourself constantly pushing them in to avoid losing them.  I had to buy a silicone strap to keep the two attached to each other so the don‚Äôt venture off.  The use of the strap is ridiculous, and shouldn‚Äôt be necessary, but I don‚Äôt feel like buying a replacement AirPod and wasting more money.",2,1,2019-12-14,1,2,0
"I have been an Apple geek since 2004. Since Jobs' demise, quality control has declined precipitously as evidenced by increased numbers of defective units making it onto sales floors (& Apple refusing to stand behind them, from numerous expensive experiences). This is yet one more example of a unit that should not have reached the sales floor (defective).Had this unit since end of April. In 4 mos. I went from zero knowledge to expert at troubleshooting: syncing problems, charging problems, cleaning, unpairing/pairing, syncing/resyncing all for the Left ear bud. Mine is constantly (several times a week) not working. At all. My phone (XR, updated) cannot recognize it.",2,1,2020-9-3,1,1,0
"Update from last review: I tried again and bought another pair. Still could not pass ear test. Found a test online where it was suggested that someone who can't pass the ear fit test buy a foam ear tip, stipe off the plastic liner and then fit it behind the Apple supplied tips. It took some doing but it did result in 50% of the time I can now pass the ear fit test. Plus because the seal is so much better the noise cancellation works better. I've raised my rating to 4 stars because when properly fitted the sound quality is much better than the AirPods 1st generation but you do have to work on it. I won't return them now.While $260 is a lot for a pair of earbuds I thought having wireless AirPods  with noise cancellation, different size ear tips and better acoustics was worth the money. But alas, even with trying different ear tips I couldn't get the ear fit test to come back positive. I chatted with Apple Support and they told me to ignore the warning that the fit wasn't right because that only is important for noise cancellation or better sound. Hello? Why did I buy them. I know why I returned them a few hours later.",4,1,2020-4-23,1,1,0
"These are awesome!  I do a tremendous amount of research before I purchase items like this, frequently buying and returning items if they aren't exactly what I was looking for.  These Bluetooth ear pods are clearly the top of the heap at this time.  I love that I can use either of them alone, (or together), and they each have full controls.  (Most of the good ear pods can't do that). I can access Siri anytime by just saying ""hey siri"".  They have great noise cancellation that I can turn on and off with a push on either of the pods.  I can skip forward or back a song, pause, play etc. - and again those controls are on both pods.  And the biggest surprise was something even Apple support incorrectly told me they can't do - I listen to a lot of audio books, and by clicking either pod 3 times, it will jump back 30 seconds in the book, or jump forward 30 seconds with 2 clicks.  Anyone who listens to audio books will love this function.  The only drawback is a battery life of only 4.5-5 hours.  However, since I can use each pod separately that doubles the time.  Plus the case is the smallest I've seen, easily fitting in a pocket, and that charges the pod(s) very quickly.",5,1,2019-11-15,1,2,0

There is no bass, or any sparkle to the sound. It's just not lively. I can't understand why other reviews don't speak to this issue. Perhaps since they are so easy to use, the sound quality and music quality just don't matter. Perhaps it's just because it's Apple. I know that there is an equalizer on the iPhone but that seems to work only with Apple Music. I compared the Pros with the Sony XM3s and there is no comparison in the sound quality. The Sonys win by many miles. I use Spinfit 360 tips and have no problems with them staying in my ears, and they are comfortable. They also have an app that allows for wonderful EQ adjustments. The Sony call quality is fine. Calls are clear on both ends with a new firmware update. All in all, the sound quality of the Pros is seriously lacking.

This is the headphones I have been waiting for. When the original AirPods were released I wasn‚Äôt impressed- the open nature and absence of noise canceling didn‚Äôt appeal to me. I remained a loyal Plantronics user with their mono noise canceling sets. When this arrived I had to check it out. The smaller form factor and amazing noise canceling keeps this well and above the original AirPods. The transparency mode keeps the commuters and family conversations going. Only ask is for a longer battery life. I am sure Apple will figure that out with future upgrades.

These I can wear and have worn for three hours with no need to remove them.Sound wise they aren‚Äôt going to make me throw away my Bose Quiet Comfort headphones or even my pair of ten year old Sony Open Ear headphones. But the sound is perfect for background listening of classical orchestra and piano. I love them in the background while reading, doing desk work and even taking my daily hour long outdoor walk.

When there is a loud sound (like when i clear my throat), and noise cancellation (or transparency) is on, there is a loud crackling/buzzing sound.

The shape of the headphones are very odd & bulky! I have daith rings in my ears & I have to completely remove them in order for these to fit. Once I got them in, they make my ears VERY sore after wearing them a little while. I have a job that allows me to wear my headphones & listen to music for the majority of my day, anywhere from 4-8hrs a day & these are super uncomfortable even with the smallest rubber fitting. The rubber fitting also wouldn‚Äôt stay on one of the headphones so the stupid thing kept getting lodged in my ear & I‚Äôd have to pull it out with tweezers üò≥. Transparency is unnecessary to me. When I used them to workout they kept starting to fall out, especially once I started sweating. I don‚Äôt like Siri so I hate that you have to ask her to turn the volume up & down!

Talking on the phone seems to be ok, I haven't heard any complaints from people on the other end. With the echo buds, people said I sounded muffled.",2,1,2020-8-14,1,1,0
"I ordered these for my child who deals with Misophonia and needs noise cancelling devices to sleep. While they are very good at doing what they say, I feel it is VERY misleading that description states ""The Wireless Charging Case delivers more than 24 hours of battery life."" What that actually means is that the CASE stays charged for 24 hours - the AirPods only last for 4 HOURS. How is that at all useful? For $235.00 that is a ridiculously short amount of time that they are actually functional and we are very disappointed.I am currently looking for another option and will be returning them.",2,1,2019-11-28,1,5,0
"This review is especially for people who are deaf in one ear (SSD), Single-sided deafnessAfter a hesitation for about a month, I decided to buy Apple AirPods Pro. I couldn‚Äôt find any information on whether it would help my SSD. But I decided to go ahead and buy a pair anyway.",5,1,2020-8-7,1,1,1
"Ambos lados puedes usarlos diferentes opciones, por ejemplo: el auricular derecho puedes hacer para llamar a SIRI, y en el auricular izquierdo puedes activar la cancelacion de ruido. O viceversa.. lo unico que le falto fue un control de volumen.. infelizmente solo puedes subir y bajar el volumen desde tu celular.. resto esta muy bueno..",5,1,2019-11-30,1,6,1
"I was impressed by the sound quality.  They were much better than the Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 2 which people rave about.  They integrate seamlessly into the Apple eco system, which is great for iPhone users.  Unfortunately, they would either slip out of my ear (almost lost one on a walk), or they would feel like they were slipping out of my ear, despite trying the various size earbud adapters.  I especially like how you can share your audio, as my fianc√©e and I did on a walk.  I tried some 3rd party earbud adapters, which fit better, but weren‚Äôt as comfortable.  Apple - why just put a soft loop around the ear like Bose and Beats and be done with it?  At the end of the day, it was too unnerving walking around with expensive electronics in my ear never knowing when I might lose them.  I returned them.  I hope they‚Äôll have a more secure design with the AirPods Pro 2.  Of you cruise the internet, you‚Äôll see a number of people experience the same problem.  Also, the noise cancellation didn‚Äôt knock my socks off.  However, transparency mode was really nice.  I hated to admit it, but with transparency mode and audio sharing, you almost don‚Äôt need a home sound system, as good as these sound.  I just wish they‚Äôd stay in my damn ear.",3,1,2020-8-9,1,1,0
"I bought the pro version three months ago and accidentally tossed them into the trash (I was drying them with tissues) so I went for the cheapest replacement (Airpods 2). Here are my thoughts as to which one to choose.If this is the only listening device you have and you care about music quality, then buy Airpods Pro (noticeably superior music quality that falls far below earphones such as Sennheiser HD599; the quality is also below that of Boss QC35II). (If I were you, I would buy the cheaper airpods 2 AND an HD599.)",4,1,2020-6-6,1,1,0
"Having just upgraded from the AirPods 1, I‚Äôm blown away. The noise cancellation and transparency mode options are the biggest deal. I put these on just as my professor ended class and everyone started getting up and making a giant ruckus. It was like the room went nearly silent. They‚Äôre also significantly more comfortable than the AirPods. I can wear these for hours and not feel any discomfort. I could be wrong but they seem like they take a little longer than the originals to charge, but it‚Äôs not bad at all. I was worried about the size of the case but the increase in size isn‚Äôt noticeable in my pocket. Highly recommend these.",5,1,2019-11-15,1,2,0
"Honestly, I was a little bit spectacle about purchasing this AirPods, because I know the original ones are just like the wired Apple earphones, where you can hear the sounds from outside and I did not want to spend 100$+ for earphones that can hear outside! Smh So I did my research diligently (for weeks). Finally decided to purchase the AirPods pros for my birthday especially because I love Apple and after my LG TONE Pro HBS-770 broke down within 10 months smh, never buying again.I am a huge audiophile and especially when it comes to picture and sound; I look for the best. I tested both LG and AirPod Pro and the Pros comes in first because it does block out any noise from the outside - I would say mostly 80%. I also hear that it adapts to the sound to actively block out any noise outside especially when I shop: I can‚Äôt hear my footsteps, the people around, the car on the streets. It‚Äôs amazing! Plus I can leave them in my ear and they are so comfortable, especially when I‚Äôm on the treadmill they stick like glue! Plus it helps with the sweat resistant feature the AirPods provide! Sometimes I forget they are in my ear lol also the transparency mode works well so I don‚Äôt have to remove my earphones (but seriously I‚Äôm listening to music why are you talking to me) lol",5,1,2019-12-24,1,2,1
"I have had/owned and still own many wireless headsets/earbuds.If you're an apple/iOS user, Airpods are a no-brainer.  I didn't love the originals, the battery life wasn't great.  They'd be cooked on a 2 hour conference call before the call was over.  90 mins in you have to pull one pre-emptively and place it in the case to catch a charge then swap.  I figured these would be the same, but they are considerably better.",5,1,2019-12-5,1,2,0
"I have been avoiding the Apple AirPods since when I tried them I couldn't keep them in my ear and they constantly fall out.  The original AirPods did not have the ear piece that the Pro comes with.  The original was annoying with meh sound quality and no noise cancellation feature.The AirPods Pro are definitely different.  I don't have any problem keeping them in my ear as I walk and the sounds quality is so crisp on both sides I have not had any bluetooth device work so well like these.  However, they do get a bit of getting used to since there's no actual buttons or anything to push on the AirPods.  But get used to the following is not that hard: Using two fingers, squeeze the flat side on each AirPod. You'll hear a click in your ear with each press.",5,1,2019-11-30,1,2,0
"These AirPods are amazing.  The noise cancellation and its inverse ambient noise allowance are incredible.  I use them riding my bike to be able to still hear movement around me, and I use them in my shop to drown out loud noises.  Both functions work extremely well.But.. 2 weeks in and now my left AirPod no longer holds charge.  I can put it in the case and see it get up to about 35%, but as soon as it comes out it drops to 7% and then dies.  The AirPods haven't been dropped or put through the washer or anything: it just appears that one has gone defective.  That being said, it is also very hard to monitor battery life on them.  You have to have the case with you, and even then it doesn't always show you battery status.  You may have to enable it as an extra screen on your iPhone, and then sometimes it won't tell you the charge of each individual AirPod.  I found this frustrating for the few days I was trying to diagnose what was failing before retuning. them.  Hopefully I'll be sent me a new pair and they can hold charge.",1,1,2020-7-30,1,2,0
"I would absolutely give these Airpod Pros 5 stars if they included the USB C charging block with them,  the noise cancellation feature actually cancelled out low frequency sound waves and they included a volume control ON the actual earbuds.  I'm kind of annoyed that I had to go and purchase a seperate $20 USB C charging block to plug the charging cable into.  These airpods do charge wirelessly in the case but you will eventually need to recharge the case up which is why they include a chaging cord but it is USB C to take note of that.  There is also no volume control on the earbuds. You need to go to your phone which can be inconvenient if jogging or working out with them. They also do not cancel low frequency sound from neighbor's audio equipment but then nothing so far has.  Overall the sound quality is amazing and I love the noise cancellation feature while listening to music at the gym.  It totally turns off all surrounding noise for machines, weights being dropped, etc... I do love them but they could be improved.",4,1,2019-12-7,1,2,0
"I can‚Äôt express how much I love these. I did loads of research looking for a cheaper alternative and a better value. I arrived back at the AirPods pro and they have not disappointed!I just recently took a 4 hr flight from Dallas to Seattle with kids crying and annoying people playing music out of their phones. The ANC was a game changer! It made a normally frustrating flight, enjoyable. I was able to relax and listen to music the whole time. This feature alone makes them worth their weight in gold in my opinion!",5,1,2020-1-26,1,3,0
I had the 2019 air pods and some Bose noise cancelling headphones.  These air pod pros fit in my ear canal well. They don't hurt my ear after a while. The noise cancelling is excellent. I turn them off when somebody needs to talk to me in a loud environment (e.g. Starbucks) by just short holding one of the tips. The difference is noticeable. I like how you can pause and unpause.  The sound quality is really good but not as good as over the ear noise cancelling headphones which I expected. I do wish there was more functionality for phone calls such as mute/unmute and hangup.,4,1,2019-12-21,1,3,0
"When they were first introduced I wasn't a big fan of the sound quality or the way they looked. Personally I was never a big fan of the bigger stem that the previous airpods had. Now with the Pros I really like the more premium/slim look they have going for them.When it comes to sound these won't blow you away, but once you turn on ANC they're a different headphone. It feels like the bass is more punchy and overall everything sounds cleaner. A much bigger improvement over the previous generations. There's also a transparency mode. I love it. I can have these on at work and still hear the work phone/ coworkers if need be. The battery life in general for most buds still needs work, but the charging case does wonders. I'll typically get about 4ish hours of sound and then put them in the charging case. I leave work at 4:30 and decided to put them in to charge at 4:13. When I left they went from 0-73% so I was really impressed by the fast charging.",4,1,2019-11-12,1,1,0
"I bought these for one reason and one reason only - the noise cancellation feature.  There are certainly less expensive units on the market that sound better.  Having said that, I had no issue with the sound - I found it to be pleasing.  I immediately noticed on pairing the AirPods that when switching between the Noise Cancellation and Transparency modes there is absolutely zero difference in the sound.  In the so-called noise cancellation mode, I could clearly hear the rain outside, people speaking and the TV audio.  I tried different tips with the same result.  I called Apple support and after about a half hour of trying various things, we were unable to get the noise cancellation mode to work.  Now I have to go through the hassle of paying a $198 deposit to Apple to assure that I will send the unit back upon receiving the replacement unit and of course there is no guarantee that it will work.  If I was really smart, I would send it back to Amazon in that if the next one doesn't work, I probably won't be able to do so.  Major disappointment after paying for an alleged high-end product!Oh and yes, no matter what combination of tips I use and no matter how much I adjust the AirPods, I cannot pass the ear till fit test.  One would think that a company like Apple would have better quality control - mine was defective out of the box.",1,1,2020-9-10,1,1,0
"Bought this for my dad. Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt come with a USB C charging brick and his iPhone charging brick has a USB A (the regular, well adopted USB type) port.

"I got these for my wife so she wouldn't keep asking for my noise cancelling headphones when we travel and they are great! I know this is going to read like a fake review, because we all know what those read like, but these things are truly great! The sound quality is great, the noise cancelling is good as well. I'm sure you could get better NC with a different product, but these were great for general use. They also pair and turn on automatically when you open to case, which is great. The only thing I hate about them is the battery life and lack of volume control. They can last for a whole day on standby/light listening, but if you use them for calls, they'll die inside of an hour before needing more juice from the case. The stems also have controls for skip, back, play/pause, siri, but no option for volume. That's crazy to me! I hope apple adds this as an option in a future update, but for now, volume has to be changed on the phone (or a paired apple watch if you have one).Great product!",5,1,2020-1-27,1,1,0
"I didn‚Äôt like the fact that these AirPods Pros didn‚Äôt come with the plug adapter for the USB-C cord...! If you‚Äôre gonna put the lightening charger & a new charging plug system(USB-C), then why wouldn‚Äôt you include the plug adapter so that anyone who purchased one of these things could charge it. Apple history shows us, without saying or speaking the obvious, that every time anyone purchases an Apple product, there was no need to even think about wether or not that this new device needed a plug for charging because we already new that it came with it...! So now Apple comes up with these new top of the line AirPods Pro, which aren‚Äôt cheap, without including a plug charger, what gives...!?!? One would think that it should be included for as much as they‚Äôre charging for them & why not, Apple includes them with everything else...that‚Äôs just poor planning & marketing when it comes to customer service...!!!",1,1,2020-9-10,1,2,0
"These have saved my life at work. Working in an office with some pretty loud people was my life, but when these came out that all changed. Obviously they‚Äôre not perfect. I can still hear noise around me when NC is on but with NC on and music playing at a decent volume, these things can really help you focus so much better. I‚Äôve never owned a pair of noise cancelling earbuds but I can‚Äôt imagine another pair being THAT much greater than what these are. If you own an iPhone and enjoy listening to music, then these are a no brainer.",5,1,2019-11-25,1,2,0
"Honest review. When they work, I truly enjoyed the sound quality and noise cancellation feature of these AirPods. But literally within the first day of using my AirPod Pros I started experiencing Bluetooth connectivity issues. The AirPods would randomly start getting static every so often when I would start walking and then go back to normal. I thought this was a fluke so I let it go and didn‚Äôt think much of it. About a week later and I‚Äôm using them today and the same thing keeps happening, but worse. They would get so much static but this time it wouldn‚Äôt go away, so I would have to stop my song and try and reset them. Eventually the right bud just went out and wouldn‚Äôt come back on while the left remained in/out of static periodically. Needless to say I‚Äôm sending them back tomorrow for a replacement pair, I liked them that much when working. I could have just got a bad, faulty pair? Who knows. But it‚Äôs disappointing to spend $250 on a item and it not work properly. I would say this fault is most definitely on Apple and not Amazon however. Amazon provided me with the return label no questions asked and are sending me a new replacement pair in due time. Hopefully Apple will get a little better at thoroughly testing products before sending them out to sale.",1,1,2020-4-21,1,2,0
"It's very hard to impress me when it comes to switching from headphones to earphones. That being said, the reason I wanted the Airpod Pros was because Airpods/Pros are discreet looking (not disappointed at all in that factor by the way.) I am and still am in love with my Beats Studio 2.0s. Before you roll your eyes and read the next review, I've found a way to improve sound quality in them, by upping the dB rating on iTunes for my music. My point is: my Beats Studio 2.0s are SUPER loud and the bass is smooth and rocky at the same time. But, for working, working out, etc., I have a hard time keeping them on. I did NOT want to pay $250 for ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ earphones! Anyways, I finally had them delivered, ready to be disappointed, and I was ‚Ä¶ for about an hour. Once I got used to the sound, it started sounding more and more like my Beats Studios. Keep in mind that even if you hate Beats products, headphones are still always going to beat earphones when it comes to sound. But wow, these are so close to my Beats, and I am still shocked. Connecting them to your phone is easy, the bass is the best it gets with earphones (and I mean this in a good way, because the bass really does sound good if they're pushed all the way in your ear) and they're so discreet and nice looking! I know the design received lots of hate, and that's understandable. They look like mini hair dryers, or the water nozzle gun from Mario Sunshine lmao, but in reality, when they're in your ears, they look and feel amazing. They stay in so well, it's shocking. Seriously, if you take anything from this, know that I am a diehard and very picky headphone user, and listen to music constantly, and yet I'm still shocked. The only negative thing is Apple's greed which can get the best of people based on brand names. I can't justify the price range, so I would suggest waiting until they're around $150-200 (even though that'll never happen, so maybe you should bite the bullet and go for it!)",5,1,2020-3-16,1,0,0

"For the past 3 years, I used Beats solos while I got through my Masters and Doctorates. 1/2 way to the finish line my Beats gave out, plus the fabric was finally ripping of the ears. I did a lot of research before getting these and I was very hesitant about getting cordless ear buds.  These are BEYOND my expectations! The sound is a bit bassy, but clear, I listen to a lot loci, you can hear every crack and pop, I love it.  Buds usually don't stay in my ears,  they are quite comfortable,  I hardly know I am wearing them and the noise cancelling is amazing. My spouse can play video games on surround sound and I can't even hear it. They are simple to use and I so nice to have!  Any one on the fence about these, I would say that this is one of the best purchases I have made in a very long time.",5,1,2020-7-15,1,1,0
"After 2-3 weeks of usage there is a slight crackling sound the accompanies bass. Once you notice it , you hear it all the time.

I bought 3 pairs, in 3 separate orders, and all have same sound and serial number issues.",1,1,2020-5-17,1,3,0
"I can personally attest to the noise cancellation in these being insane. My wife purchased them about a month ago, and since then we fight multiple times a day. It goes like this: I say something to her in the other room, nothing, I yell to the other room, nothing, I scream to her in the other room, nothing. At this point concerned I go into the room, only to see her, with these in her ears, blissfully unaware of my attempts to converse. Upset I wave my hands and already being at a 10/10, begin yelling at her as soon as the head phones are out. If this goes on I am going to start cheating on her in the other room, feeling confident that thanks to apples patented noise cancellation technology I could have over multiple suitors, and have them talk dirty to me through a megaphone without ever disturbing the love of my life in the least. Thanks Apple!",5,1,2020-6-17,1,3,0
"Fortunately I managed to lose my first generation airpods, case and all, so decided to upgrade to these. They are a quantum leap forward. Not only do they fit better in my ears due to the custom sizes, but even without noise cancelation turned on, they do a great job of eliminating outside sound. The transparency mode works great- sound quality is the same, but you can listen out for important things/people. I am a classical musician, and this music has a lot of pauses and soft passages, which the noise cancelation shows off very well. Also, the sound changes very very little with it on compared to off, which sounds the absolute best IMHO. I miss the total comfort of the originals as well as the ease of tapping vs. squeezing; but the differences are worth it and I understand why Apple made these changes. The sound is very flat and natural, not overly bassy. If you want to change the EQ, that can be done within settings.  And, I just took a shower with them in.  Could also work in a bathtub I presume. Nice to have Siri and all controls available even in the shower! Bathroom speakers work, but not with this great sound, and noise reduction! I own some excellent and more expensive full sized headphones that are great for listening critically, but these certainly hold their own.  I like them more than the wired Bose earbuds I used for long time until the wires frayed. Finally, I have a full beard and even though these new Airpods are shorter than the original and the ends are within my beard, people tell me my sound on the phone is perfect.  So, I would recommend these to any iPerson who can afford them.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0

"I needed to replace my much abused Bose SoundSport wireless headphones, and the new version without the connecting cord did not have solid reviews.  While I have not has much luck with the cheaper corded headphones that come with your iPhone (they fall out, and fit weird), given the rave expert reviews of these and Amazon's generous return policies I decided to take a chance.The fit, function and clever design won me over the first day.  Running inside on treadmill or outside on the road- no slips, perfect retention.  And while they cannot rival over the ear headphones for sound cancellation, they do a pretty good job.  And the functionality with the iPhone 11 Pro is top notch.  Qi charging was easy too.  The reviews are correct, these are the new king of wireless ear buds.",5,1,2020-2-27,1,1,0
"I am a person who bought the original AirPods even though I knew they would not fit and the sound quality was average at best. You may ask yourself ‚Äúwhy would he make these crazy sacrifices‚Äù? That is because I hate in ear headphones and everything I hated about them Apple fixed. As I stated previously I can not fit AirPods unless I mimic a corpse and sit perfect still but the AirPods Pro fit me PERFECTLY. I absolutely HATE the feeling of something being deep in my ear canal and poking against my eardrums and this is a feeling that most if not every in ear headphone offers. They all offer this EXCEPT the AirPods Pro, somehow and someway Apple made in ear headphones that don‚Äôt go in your ear, well at least they don‚Äôt feel as if they do because they are super comfortable and don‚Äôt offer that ridiculously uncomfortable feeling of something being deep in your ear and knocking on the door of your eardrum. Don‚Äôt ask me how they did, but they did it.The next reason why I despise in ear headphones and refused to wear them is because when you put them in and created that seal it‚Äôs almost like you can hear your brain working, it creates an almost underwater like feeling, but again somehow, Apple was able to mitigate if not completely eliminate that feeling. The 2 main reasons I can not wear in ear headphones are gone, but that‚Äôs not it, there‚Äôs more. The sound quality and profile is incredible, these sound WAY better than the OG AirPods and the noise cancellation which I could personally care less about, makes the world disappear right before my ears.

"So far I have not found any cons but I have only had them for 2 days. They have, however, been in my ears since then and I did find that they were so comfortable I forgot they were in my ears save for the fact that that sweet sounds were filling my head. In regards to the sounds provided by the earbuds, I found the music extremely clear and the rendering of the different instruments precisely distinct. The first night I fell sleep listening to music and when I awoke in the AM they were still in my ears while they were saying that they needed to be recharged. But they were still in my ears.  All other ear buds I have tested fell from my ears resulting in my having to search the bedding in the morning.I highly recommend the Apple earbuds pro to anyone interested in earbuds.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,1,0
"The short review:  Although these earbuds sounded good to me and the noise cancellation was good, I'm still returning them.  They don't seem to fit properly with either the small or medium ear pieces and they are a bit large in the ear for sleeping, which is one of the main things I wanted them for.  I think they'd be great for the vast majority of people, they just didn't suit me.The longer review:  I am not an audiophile but I do appreciate music that sounds good.  I enjoy using headphones and hearing nuances in the music that I miss when listening on speakers.  However, the only time I use headphones are when walking, the occasional airplane trip, and for sleeping.  Yes, I'm one of those people who need sounds to sleep.

"Apple's wired earbuds have always hurt my ears and I found them very uncomfortable. When AirPods first came out I was disappointed they used the same design. Finally the AirPod Pros came out and I saw a better design and a lot of great features! So I ordered them.Once i got them I tested out all the features on various kinds of music and podcasts. I was happily surprised by how easy it was to use, the sound quality, and the features. The active noise canceling is legit. Transparency Mode is great for walks/runs outside. The waterproof makes them great for workouts. They stay in my ears better than any other in-ears I've worn. Battery life is passable. The case is stylish. They are stupid easy to set up.",5,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"First of all, yes these are expensive but I really think they're worth it if they're going to be your every day drivers. Here's why:They sound great, definitely above average. The sound is not the best out there (I think Liberty 2 pros are better in terms of sound quality) BUT the sound is still pretty great on the airpods pro. You can definitely enjoy listening to music on these and they're great for watching videos, listening to podcasts and audiobooks.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,1,0
"It's amazing technology. I love the sound quality, noise cancellation, transparency, and almost everything about it except for the fact that it keeps falling out. I have tried all the sizes. I am trying my best to keep them in but it just won't stay in for more than 30 minutes. Don't even think of wearing them while eating. There is a high chance that they will fall into your food within 10 minutes. I was very close to losing them to food. Now all this makes me skeptical about wearing them outside. It's too expensive to find them in a drain on the road somewhere. They are definitely not for working out. PS: I have been using other in-ear ones for a very long time so my ear size is okay for in-ear earbuds. Apple messed up the design this time.Update: it's not taking my Qi certified wireless charger everytime. It won't charge everytime. Also when I plug it into the wired charger, the battery doesn't charge sometimes (even when I plug it in for hours) I see that a lot of people are complaining about these being knockoffs and I have started having my doubts.",3,1,2020-5-21,1,1,0
"I have small ears which has proved to be problematic in the past with ear buds. Then add into the mix 3 inner ear piercings (daith in each ear, and one tragus) which means there was potential that they buds wouldn't stay in my ears at all. But, I have been doing a lot more out door walking and wanted to try the air pods pro any way since they were different from the traditional air pods that mimicked their ear buds. Let me tell you, I was expecting to try them and then return them within a few days, but that was not the case at all. I ended up loving them. They have managed to stay in place despite the earrings and the size of my ear and the small ear tips were just what my ears required for such a device. It's amazing how having that smaller option aside from medium and large makes such a BIG difference.The only thing is, if I am not playing my music loud, I can hear the outside world with the noice cancelling option on, but in reality it's still better than I expected and it doesn't impact my ability to hear the music or phone call at all. The transparency mode is amazing, if you compare it between the noice cancellation and off options, you hear everything as you should without the pods in your ears at all. That being said, if you compare the noice cancellation to the transparency mode, you can hear the difference. If I could give a 4.5 star, I'd give it that because the difference is so noticeable.",5,1,2020-5-21,1,1,1
"I love my AirPod pros. The sound quality is better than any headphones I‚Äôve ever. The ease of use is so nice as well because all I have to do is take them out of the case and put them in my ears and play my music. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something with the technology but my ears don‚Äôt get nearly as tired listening to music through the AirPods than usual. I can go hours with no strain on my ears. The noise cancellation is amazing. I use them for WFH and my neighbors are pretty loud mowing their lawns and kids screaming but all I have to do is put in my AirPods and turn on the active noise cancellation. When the noise cancellation is off I can hear my surroundings way better than regular headphones. I am able to hold a conversation while softly listening to music with my AirPods in. I‚Äôve never had an issue with the battery. Finally, they‚Äôre great for running. I never have adjust them while I run and the sound quality remains spectacular",5,1,2020-5-3,1,1,0
"I like the fact that the pods are so small, but why make them so slippery.  I‚Äôve already accidentally dropped them twice, and the plastic does not take falls well.  They are all scratched and nicked up.  The buds for some reason doesn‚Äôt provide a good seal in my ears, the medium  and large seems to slip out and the small doesn‚Äôt provide a god seal according to the test on the iPhone.  Not worth the MSRP in my opinion",3,1,2019-11-27,1,3,0
"It seems like the plebs don't understand active noise cancelation.  For some reason, the average, work-a-day, degenerate, trough-eating, deplorable, resistance/trump-voting norms don't seem to get that it isn't a magic potion that eliminates all the sound that you don't like at the moment.  Teasing aside, all noise cancelation works by detecting sound with a normal, repetitive aural pattern, like an airplane engine or an air conditioner, a lawn mower, etc.  It doesn't cancel all outside sound, like voices or other intermittent sound that doesn't conform to a regular, predictable pattern.  Given that knowledge, I think these headphones do the best that is physically possible from an IEM headphone.  Of course, over-the-ear headphones will insulate more outside sound, but for portable headphones these work in a close to optimal manner.  If you are use them right and fit them correctly (some ear types may just not conform, but for most they seem to work well) they have good isolation, noise cancelation, excellent sound, good fit, and the functionality is industry leading, especially when when used with apple devices.",5,1,2020-1-4,1,1,0
"These earbuds are an ENORMOUS ripoff. More often than not, at least one of them doesn't charge while in the case, even if I clean it out with a cotton swab first. Rarely do both connect to my phone/watch/Peloton at once - most of the time I only have sound out of one ear. If you sweat, they slip and fall right out with the slightest movement (end yes, they are snug in my ear when dry). Forget about using them with a Peloton or other piece of equipment unless you force your iPhone to ""Forget"" them first; the Apple connection overrides all else and won't let you switch to a different device. Then when you go to pair them to your phone again, have fun with that. It typically takes me at least 4 or 5 tries before my iPhone will acknowledge their existence in order to pair up. Earlier this week I had to try TWELVE times, and finally rebooted my phone and did a hard reset on the earbuds to get them connected again. Alas, the left earbud, though showing 100% charge, is now completely dead - no sound out of it for the past 10 days.. These pieces of crap lasted less than a year. I'm off to buy some Powerbeats Pros instead and hope they fare better.",1,1,2020-9-12,1,1,0
"These Airpod Pros are nearly perfect in design and implementation.  They give you several different size choices, which was critical for me because the original Airpod flat-out did not fit my ears at all well.  These do, and not only that they feature a built-in test to tell you if the fit is good.  Like the old Airpod, these immediately pair to your iPhone quickly and automatically.  I got a phone call in a noisy Peet's Coffee house today and was able to quickly put these on to take the call.  And the noise cancelling is really good.  It really helped me on the call.  You can go into the iPhone Setting's menu (Bluetooth) and hit the (i)nformation button, and adjust the Airpod Pro, i.e. turn noise cancelling off, switch to ""transparent"" mode, etc.  These devices are really well thought-out.  RJB.The music fidelity with this device is superb.",5,1,2020-1-26,1,1,0
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, these are excellent overall... however, the biggest thing I cannot get over is the battery life. It is terrible. Call me spoiled, but having the Galaxy Buds+ with 11hrs of playtime meant I could wear them all day at work, and at home doing chores with minimal charging of the buds. Even using the Jabra Elite 75T with 8hrs battery life was still enough to not have me worry (I couldn‚Äôt get used to the master Right bud connection)Airpods pro, on the other hand, deliver 5 hrs if your lucky. Use ANC or transparency its north of 4 hrs! 4 hrs means I‚Äôm constantly worrying about battery life.

"I got these after accidentally running my 1.0s through the wash. I have to say I'm really impressed with the fit of them, I actually always preferred the style of the earpods over regular silicone earbuds when apple first released them as they fit my ear really well and likewise the first airpods. But the pro s do fir really well and you need the plug style for noise cancellation; so not really a complaint, just something I took note of. I do miss the tapping of the original airpods to pause/play and what-have-you as opposed to the pressing input of the pros as it makes it a little easier to drag out of your ear especially if you're using them while you exercise which I do a lot, on the flip side though its harder to accidentally press them than it was on the originals. The noise cancellation is great, obviously not as good as on high end headphones and such but really great for being wireless earbuds. So overall I really like them but there are a few complaints. For one the battery life really isn't too good, its better using them in regular mode without transparency or noise cancellation as with either of those modes you will have about half of your maximum battery life it seems. And second the PRICE holy smokes I don't really know how I convinced myself to spend $240 on wireless earbuds, I heard those Raycon ones that every youtuber advertises aren't really that bad. Anyways I just gotta say it: these things are overpriced as hell, I'm not even an apple snob, so who knows why I bought it, $140 for the 1s is already pretty steep but whatever that's apple I guess. That being said if you're just a huge fan of apple products or just really want the brand names, or just have extra money to blow then yeah they're great but if you're not seriously just skip these they are way too expensive.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"They malfunctioned after two days. ANC flipped on and off randomly very quickly, right transport controls were gone after one day. Could only control from left. I returned them.

"Quick Summary - The microphones are great on these for calls in noisy environments. The sound quality is good and they get plenty loud. Overall I'm impressed. Seems like Apple got all the basics covered very well. These are 90% at everything, and 100% at microphone. There's room for other headphones to do better on sound quality, battery life, etc. but Apple made a great set of headphones that puts everything together very well.More details...",5,1,2020-9-3,1,0,0
"After trying several other, cheaper options for true wireless headphones, someone let me try their Airpods Pro. Immediately it was clear that they were far more comfortable than anything else I'd tried, and after a little research I found its the way they opted to design the rubber tips without the plastic, or sometimes when metal tube going through the center of the tips.The sound quality was pretty good. They weren't as good as my Sennheiser HD600s, but neither are any earbuds that I know of... true wireless or not. So it's more than acceptable, and thankfully they aren't following the trend of masking quality with excessive bass either. It's a pretty well balanced sound that is clear and crisp enough to not be distracting you with poor playback performance.",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0

The newest Sony cans have fabulous sound and noise cancellation, but their onboard controls frustrated me too much to want to keep them. The best Bose cans sound great too, but BT connectivity is sometimes a hassle, and the cord is a nuisance.",5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0
"love the noise canceling. These don't stay in my ear. My husband has a set of regular air pods and i can run with them with no fear of them falling out. These are different and I don't love the fit compared to the regular AirPods. I also can NOT control the volume on my Garmin music 254 that i just purchased. The AirPods are perfect, but the AirPods Pro volume is SO loud and can't run with them. sad because i don't run with my phone and just use my watch. The noise canceling is awesome. I sew with them and use my very loud serger as well. So mixed feelings. I feel like i need a pair of both. regular for fit in ears, and volume when running (non apple watch device), and the noise canceling when sewing and using toy phone for pods or music. :(",4,1,2020-5-30,1,1,0
"First off I wanted to say I am a brand kind of guy and Apple is the brand of choice, not only for myself but my ENTIRE family is Apple. We have several iPads, a Mac Book. All 6 phones on my contract are the latest of iPhone models  and we also have 2 pair of AirPod Pros.  I bought my wife the first set and she just absolutely raved about them.  The sound quality.  Battery life and all that is Apple.  So I ordered me a set and before I go off on this little tear, I just want to reiterate that my family is Apple through and through.  I am a truck driver and the only headset I ever sported is a Blue Parrot B450-XT. The headset is bulky, heavy on one side , the range is t that great and if you wear it long enough you‚Äôre ear will start to feel like someone hit you upside the head with a 2x12.  That being said..,the ABSOLUTE BEST THING about this headset is the noise canceling ability.  I could stand out by my truck getting fuel at a truck stop with not only my hood up and engine running but multiple other trucks at the fuel stop fueling their trucks with the engines running and some with their hoods up.  My point is...the people that I were in the phone with had ABSOLUTELY no idea what I was in the middle of a slew of running trucks fueling as I was because the noise cancellation is SO GOOD on this unit.  However, as I said before, this unit is bulky, heavy and puts quite a bit of pressure on your ear the longer you wear it.I have 7‚Äù straight stacks and they are loud and the one on the driver side of my truck is no more than 14‚Äù away from my head so my ears get a workout and one last time...the B450-XT‚Äôs noise canceling ability is second to none!",5,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0
"It would be a 1 if it didn't come packed with so many fun features and functions. There was an awesome deal on Amazon for these where they were $50 off. I've been using an older pair of Beats headphones that I won at a VMworld conference years ago. They work great, but are definitely bulky.When I finally convinced myself to get these AirPod Pros, I was super excited to try them out for my workouts. And you know what? They were garbage. I don't usually throw that word around. But they quickly failed an easy 1 mile ""stay in my ear"" jog test. And continued to fail brilliantly during my strength workout. When I say fail, I mean they would pop out, dislodge, or just come lose out of my ear every 10-20 seconds. Or, they would just pop out entirely if I did a bent-over stretch. So, ALL of those amazing noise cancellation, mic transparency functions, and super cool features were completley useless... because these things wouldn't stay in my ear. In fact, to get the benefits of all of those features, these AirPods not only need to be in your ear, they need to be 'firmly' in there and shouldn't come lose. I tried the medium AirPod Pro tips, as well as the large ones; no difference. For $200 (discounted from $250), these AirPods should not only stay in my year, but they also need to be whispering sweet nothings to me while I workout. This was the fastest I've ever returned an Apple product.",2,1,2020-9-23,1,0,0
"Seriously, these are amazing. Full disclosure: I'm an Apple fan-boy most days. There are a few things they make that I'm not, but for the most part I totally geek out on them. But these are fantastic. I told myself they were too expensive, and that my 1st gen AirPods were still going strong. I had those for almost 3 years and the batteries finally started to give up the ghost from almost daily use. I got some other headphones and while they were great (and way less expensive) it just wasn't the same. Then I went on a trip to Rome. I had no noise canceling headphones of any kind, and regretted that decision the entire time there and back. I ordered these on my return trip so that I would be prepared for any upcoming trips and they have quickly become my favorite headphones to date.",5,1,2020-3-5,1,1,0
Bluetooth noise cancellation earbuds provides convenience at the cost of audio quality. There is simply no way there are going to beat a good pair of wired headphones. But even I was surprised by just had bad these were. IF you turn off noise cancellation you could get about 85% of the sound quality of my cheap $9 Hypergear earbuds and 70% of my Bowers & Wilkins C5 Series 2.  The active noise cancellation will literally destroy your high end and while EQ could help somewhat it simply can't bring back what is not there. If you are looking for social status or just like helping Apple makes a few more billion then by all means get these. The fit and comfort is outstanding. If you are looking to listen to some good music get a decent pair of wired headphones.,3,1,2020-7-1,1,1,0
"My left airpod died after 5 weeks of light use - no sound was coming out of it whatsoever. These never left my desk - a hardware failure after such light usage is not great. Unfortunately I was two weeks out of the return window, and I had to deal with Apple's notoriously bad online customer service because of COVID. Even if this issue is resolved I'm going to give these away to a family member and get a cheaper pair of buds with better build quality.The noise cancelling itself isn't great, it couldn't filter out some sounds that noise cancelling headphones are supposed to excel at, like air conditioners or airplane noise.",1,1,2020-7-29,1,2,0
"Love, Love, Love these.  We have tried so many headphones and buds, etc and nothing comes close to what these AirPods do. First, the noise canceling is so strong it blew away other bulky earphones we bought for airplane travel.  As for comfort - you'll forget they're even in your ear.  I have Wireless Jaybirds, the 2'nd gen Apple EarPods, and Bose wireless ear buds and these surpass them.  They arrived less than 24 hours after ordering for Father's Day gift but after sampling there they became a Mother's  Day Gift and the hubby ended up with the older model.  In addition - if you order on the apple site they charge extra if you want a wireless case to charge.  On Amazon they automatically come with that upgrade at a price  that's below Apples regular price.",5,1,2020-7-9,1,1,0
"I lost my 2nd gen AirPods. I had resisted buy the AirPods Pro, because my AirPods were working fine for the most part. Yes, I sometimes had feed back and a weird sound going from one ear to the next, but I listen to news and books, not music, so it was fine. But, like I said, I lost them. The 'Find My' app said they were in my apartment complex, but I figured they had dropped out of my pocket on my way to my car and someone had picked them up and were enjoying them. After a month of not finding them and looking everywhere I finally accepted they were gone forever and bought the AirPods Pro.Honestly, at first, I wasn't impressed. I really didn't see much difference in the first few hours. I tried the transparency mode and noise canceling mode and it seemed like there was virtually no difference. Oh, well, I thought, I'll keep them a few days and see if they grow on me and if they don't I'll send them back and buy the cheaper 2nd gen again. Then later that day I was listening to them and was going to blow-dry my hair and was about to take them out, because I can never hear a thing when blowing my hair dry with my 2nd get AirPods, but decided to leave them in. I was amazed that I was able to hear clearly! I went back and forth between transparency and noise cancelation and the difference was amazing! It was the same when vacuuming. My car has a fabulous, high end Harman Kardon stereo system, but I actually prefer to keep my AirPods Pro in my ears while driving instead, now.",5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"Don't waste your money on any other Bluetooth headphone. This one is almost perfect. For Apple users the functionality and connectivity is 1000% superior to all of the Bluetooth headphones. The only negative that I can say about this device is after three months the rubber in-ear portion, Loses its grip and it's ability to cohesively attached to your skin, causing the airport to drop out. You can simply purchase a new one from the Apple store directly for four dollars. In my opinion this is a manufacturing oversight and you should not have to spend a penny.Nonetheless I would recommend this to anyone that uses an Apple product. The wireless charging is phenomenal the battery lasts an extremely long time. I seem to change it once a week and I usually listen for a maximum of four hours a day.

They actually asked me if I had the right pods in the right ears. Yes, I tried all three tips. Yes, I see that there are aftermarket tips that I could buy. I don't like the fact that the case won't close with these 3rd party tips. Besides, at the price Apple is charging for these, they ought to fit.

These won't filter out all background noise, but it's the difference that I was looking for.Apple has made an impressive set of AirPods here, and the quality and design are what I've come to expect from the company. I also love that this comes with three pair of soft rubber ear cushions to accommodate different sized ear canals. Daily use for these have proven good, and I'm amazed that these don't fall out of my ear. The way Apple design the AirPods is great, and these have very rarely fallen out of my ears at all.

Second, for noise cancellation during flights.Until now, I've been using the Bose QC20 for both, so I can compare them. When riding, I listen sometimes listen to music, but not always. One of the major drawbacks of the Bose are the wires. They tend to pull the earbuds out of my ear when looking left or right for traffic, and they move around. The Airpods Pro obviously have no wires, so they don't move around or pull. My concern was that they might fall out, but they fit snug in my ears underneath my helmet.

"Look, I'm not an Apple fanboy by any stretch of the imagination, as a matter of fact I tried to leave the Applesphere by buying a Pixel 4 and a set of Galaxy Buds+. But I'll tell you what, Apple just does it better ( I found that out when I got tired of the Google Assistant and bought an iPhone 11). The Galaxy Buds+ didn't fit very well, the Air Pods do. The Galaxy Buds+ touch controls led to a lot of accidental pauses and skips, the Air Pods don't. The Galaxy Buds+ sound quality wasn't that great for the price, the Air Pods quality is really good for the price. When it comes down to it I was worried about the fit the most, and Im pleased to report the fit is really comfortable and secure. I did a few plyometric workouts (a lot of jumping around) and the Air Pods didn't even come loose much less fall out. The active noise cancellation is super nice, I can sit next to a noisy fan in my hot office and not even hear the fan. The battery life leaves a bit to be desired, only 4.5 hours on continuous play with active noise cancellation on, but that just means I have to charge the Air Pods over lunch, no big deal.These true wireless ear buds are just a better product for iPhone users, I' glad I waited for the Pro version, but I wish I had bought them sooner.",5,1,2020-7-15,1,0,0

Wearing these at the gym last night almost drowned our everything, making for a somewhat silent workout.  It's a far different experience from the normal air pods and really the main reason I bought these over something like the beats version.  I also had some problems with fit, as they would start to slip out a few times during a 30 min run.

Today one of them fell out of my ear right into a pale of water. It now suffers from water damage. Very disappointing!",3,1,2020-8-16,1,2,0
"I had the first generation AirPods that came out and it has been a couple of years and they finally gave up, so I upgraded to the AirPods pro and my God what an upgrade, the sound, and noise cancelation are insane. Only one drawback and I'm going to need time to get used to is the touch button, no more tapping to skip songs or answering calls but you have to actually click on the button on either side, not really a big deal but kind of annoying when you are jogging and wanted to skip tracks or pick up calls. Overall great purchase and please enjoy the satisfying video I uploaded of removing the plastic.",5,1,2020-5-30,1,1,0

"I love the Apple products that I have since they are very well integrated and are usually high quality.  You do pay a premium for that though.  The air pod pros sound great and the noise cancelling is really good.  My issues are that they have quirks and some quality issues.  I think they tried to put too much in such a tiny package and the software is still a little buggy.  I had to get a replacement pair after about 2 months because the left air pod stopped working.  Also, the integration with the Apple watch has some issues.  Using the timer when trying to workout will stop any musing you have playing if your air pods are connected to your phone.  If you connect to the watch, then the music will keep playing once you stop the timer alarm.  That's just weird.  Sometimes when a call comes in and I'm connected to my watch listening to music, only the left air pod will function when I restart playing my music.  I have to disconnect and reconnect to the watch to get both to work again.Overall I still like them, but they certainly are not without certain really annoying behavior.  Far from a seamless experience.",4,1,2020-5-23,1,0,0
"This is much lighter than Sony wh-1000xm3 although it does not have as good noise cancellation and sound quality. This is easier and more comfortable to wear than Bose Sportsound, my previous workout headphones.I haven't used airpods before so I can't compare in that regard. I'll definitely notice that my ears are blocked so I don't want to wear them for extended hours. They have officially 4-hour-ish listening time.

"The overall sound quality, noise cancellation, battery life, construction, and functionality of the Apple AirPods Pro was exceptional . . . truly excellent.  However, unfortunately, I was forced to return the AirPods Pro for one simple reason . . . . they would not stay in my ears.  They came with three different size ear pieces and I tried them all but none would keep the airpods from falling out eventually.  I never left the house with them because I was afraid I might lose one.  Once I stretched across the empty bath tub to hang a towel and one fell out into the tub.  After bouncing around like a dice, I put it back in and it worked just fine so I believe the airpods are constructed quite well.  I  don't believe it would be right for me to subtract stars because of a personal physiological issue . . . . that is not the fault of the Apple AirPods Pro.  I did not want to try any of the suggested fixes such as memory foam ear piece replacements.  I simply wanted them to work as is.  However, what I chose as a replacement was the Bose QuietComfort 35 II and I haven't looked back.  I believe the ""over-the-ear"" NOT ""on-the-ear"" ear cups are truly the best way to go . . . . at least for me.",5,1,2020-9-11,1,1,0
"The Airpods Pro are IMO definitely worth upgrading to from the original airpods. Using a seal the pro is able to produce much better lower frequencies. You also don't really feel the soreness or pressure some earbuds can cause. ANC and transparency mode really make them feel like they're in a completely different class. I'm not a fan of the lightning charging port, but they at least include a lightning to usb cable (not cheap) and wireless charging.My main concern is with the battery. 4.5 hours is more than enough for continuous play, and the fast charging is pretty incredible (3 hour recharge in 15 minutes). However 4.5 hours is one of the worst in its class, and doesn't leave much room for battery degredation. Relying on aggressive fast charging gives me serious concerns over the product's longevity. I wouldn't be surprised if these need replacing in 2-3 years. This is really the only reason I can't give them a 5",4,1,2020-4-13,1,1,0
"These are so worth the price.  The quality is amazing, the sound and noise cancellation is the best, the battery life is impressive.  The 4 star rating instead of 5 star is due to greedy Apple not including the 18watt USB-C square plug with these.  You get the USB-C cord but no square plug in for these high priced Air Pods (and a USB-C square plug from a MACbook is too high wattage/not recommended).",4,1,2020-6-30,1,2,0
I am connecting these to an iPhone 7. Not sure if these work better with later models.These earphones are super buggy - often people can't hear me when I answer calls - however when I pull them off my ear to answer calls - the calls still keep switching between them and the iphone which is super annoying. The older model just worked - this one I am only keeping because the noise cancellation is good and I travel by bus for my commute. I hate everything else about them including the staying inside the ear - they fall off every few minutes so I have to keep adjusting them,2,1,2019-12-25,1,1,0

AirPods Pro reviewThere are two types of noise-canceling I am talking about here. One type is canceling the noise so that my students cannot hear the background noise. This is the type of noise-canceling that I am interested in. Another type is canceling the noise so that I cannot hear the background noise. This is the type of noise-canceling that is good for listening to music.,5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"I'm pretty much invested in Apple ecosystem -- Apple TV, Macs, iPhones, etc and trust me when I say this is the best Apple product ever released. While everyone else probably uses and talks about the  Noise Cancelling feature, I'm going to talk about how AWESOME it's Transparency mode it. It's basically the opposite of noise canceling, where you'll hear the ambient noise along with whatever's playing. For someone who loves to go on long bike rides, this has been great. I can play music, podcast, or whatever to keep me occupied while also being 100% aware of the environment around me as I can hear people running past me, cars passing by, etc more clear than when I would have nothing on my ears. This is the best thing ever happened to the world of headphones.",5,1,2020-7-20,1,1,0
I like the original but was curious to try these. I don‚Äôt really need the cancellatinuch but the transparent mode is what I wanted.I often use just one so I can hear other things with the original pods. Here you could use two and still hear your surroundings.,4,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0

"Not impressed. Have been using ‚Äòclassic‚Äô Airpods till now and anticipated a decent uplift in audio quality based on the reviews of the ‚ÄòPros‚Äô. Not so much - it is a little better, but not worth the jump. Noise cancelling is so-so. If you are used to either Bose or Sony cans which cancel 80% of the droning noise in an airplane, these get to 30% at best. It is even hard to tell the difference between it being turned on and off. Besides that, they are not as easy to handle and plug in your ears as the 1st and 2nd generation. Not recommended. Hopefully the next generation will be better.Update: 4 months in now, opinion mostly unchanged - the first generation was genius, the second generation a slight improvement. The Pros just don't have that same level of polish. I am still confused every time which ""beep"" indicates whether you are in transparancy mode, normal or noise cancelling. The squeeze technique remains kind of weird. A touch / slide option to adjust the volume would have been the most useful thing they could have added, but didn't.  Getting them out of the case remains a bit of a trick (rotate them slightly). If you drop the case, the pods fall out (unlike the original one).  It just all feels a little un-Apple and a bit of a rushed product.  When switching to the normal ones (when the battery of these things is empty again), I am always amazed how ""airy"" they feel in your ears, compared to the Pros that plug in your ear canal.",2,1,2020-1-31,1,0,0
"I like the great fit, great noise cancelling, and great controls, there's no pressure while using noise cancelling like other earbuds, minus 1 star is because sometimes it takes too long for the earbuds to detect its in my ear causing incoming calls to be too late to pickup and also for the phone voice quality that I wished to be a bit better. (the switching between modes can stop working although very rarely)",4,1,2019-11-9,1,2,0
"The Airpods Pro sound quality is as good as my Bose QC35 for me.  Granted, I do have some hearing loss so perhaps I'm missing out on some of the subtle sound differences.  Although the left ear showed a good fit immediately, I had some problems fitting my right ear according to Apple's fit check.  Eventually got it.  Overall, very comfortable.  Love the addition of the ANR as it makes sound pop and is great in an office environment to tone down background noise even if I'm not listening to music. Outgoing voice quality is very good over the phone based on feedback from others as well as listening to my voice recording.However, I find that the ear adapters seem to push the Airpods Pro out of the ear after 15 minutes or so (old Airpods didn't do this).  This not only allows more outside noise in, but also sets them up to fall out during workouts or heavy head movement. Left ear fell out right at the end of a spinning class today as I got off the bike for example.",4,1,2019-11-19,1,0,0
"I'm a specs guys. Found it really difficult to spend any money on something like this but the sound upgrade in quality is worth it. While the battery life is not as long as the previous versions, I never found myself out of battery from listening to headphones 24/7 except when in the office. In that case I had only had them in for noise cancelling. Funny story a sales manager told me to turn them down once so she could continue ranting and raving while talking over everyone around her. Now that I have these noise cancelling head phones and get to work from home everyday until at least 2022 (fingers crossed) this won't ever be a problem anymore. They are great for blocking out sound from bathroom toilets flushing when hard at work tho in an office setting I don't feel I should be subjected to sitting directly near the toilets anyway. What can I say, whether blocking out rude sales managers or toilet flushing these are the best. Great for gaming too, I find myself x10 better when focused and not even noticing loud stomping, yelling, or other peoples phone conversations when I have these in.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"I got these for my wife as a graduation gift because she was all over them when they got announced but ended up returning them after we both used them for a few weeks. As a lover of other apple products, I can‚Äôt get along with these either. Regular airpods fall out of my ears, these are so big they irritate them no matter how I twist them, and her complaint was the same, after an hour they hurt. Sound quality is good, but my $30 buds sound damn close and these certainly aren‚Äôt 8x better. Noise cancelling is legit, definitely a win with these and probably the only feature I thought was good. I also had problems pairing to my iPhone, but they work fine with my wife‚Äôs iPhone and MacBook, we both run the same software too. If I open the case next to my phone it would not recognize them unless I manually went into Bluetooth settings and paired them like my cheap earbuds. Also the lack of volume control on the buds is a huge fail on Apple‚Äôs part. Overall just not impressed, especially for the price, I know the overall package is nice and so is noise cancelling, but I can‚Äôt forgive that these cost $250 and sound only marginally better than my 2 year old off-brand $30 buds. One final issue is that their case is poorly designed. The lid doesn‚Äôt click into place firmly when open so the smallest handling error and the lid wants to shut. This happens more than you‚Äôd think considering how far the buds sit inside the case and how hard they are to pull out, often falling out as they slip from your fingers. When the lid is closed it rattles and twists back and forth like some cheap dinky piece of plastic.",3,1,2019-12-14,1,0,0
"When everyone else did not have these in stock, Amazon came through with them and I had them to put under my Christmas tree. I bought several sets for all of my sons.

"I ordered the AirPods Pro in mid March.  For the first ten weeks or so of use, I was very pleased with the quality of sound, the noise cancellation and the other features.  Then the left ear bud started dropping the Bluetooth connection or losing charge, sometimes with the charge disappearing while the bud was in the charging case.  I tried the various Apple and YouTube suggestions re cleaning the contact points on the bud and inside the case.  I tried disconnecting the AirPods Pro from my iPhone and reconnecting.  These measures all worked, but the effect was short lived.  I was hassling with the device on a daily basis.  A few days ago after much annoyance and waiting on-hold, I was able to speak to an Apple rep.  A new left earbud is on its way.  However, given the lack of success others have reported after replacing one earbud, I am not feeling optimistic.  I‚Äôm sorry I bought the AirPods Pro.  I‚Äôd much rather get my money back.  For the price, these wireless earbuds should be far more reliable.  Too late to return them to Amazon now, of course.  Save yourself a lot of grief and explore alternative wireless listening options.",2,1,2020-7-6,1,0,0

The AirPods are so close (within 5-10% as good) but they are small (pocketable), rechargeable, and cost 1/4th as much.  We have at our house some Beats Studio (noise canceling) and Bose QC (noise canceling) which are both 'slightly' better, but so much larger.",5,1,2020-1-11,1,0,0
I was skeptical on these since they came out but I love them now and don‚Äôt regret them. They went on sale for $200 so I decided to try and if not I would‚Äôve returned them. After using them and the features I absolutely love the noise canceling. Even without music playing it still muffles surrounding noise. I didn‚Äôt even notice someone talking to me a few feet away at first with noise cancellation on. The transparency feature is great as well if you do want to hear background noise. I like the smaller size compared to the regular airpods. Only issue is that i can‚Äôt use them to change the volume but it‚Äôs not that big of a deal personally as I was already accustomed to it with the regular airpods. They are probably the best all around Bluetooth airpods out.  Sound quality even sounds better in my opinion. Charging case is also automatically wireless without having to pay extra like the regular airpods. A big issue I had with the regular airpods was comfortability and how well they stayed in my ear. But not with these. They‚Äôre MUCH more comfortable and really stay in your ear. The battery life could be better but they still last long and charge FAST. I can honestly say they are worth it if you are looking to upgrade.,5,1,2020-9-18,1,0,0
Bought these AirPod Pros for my sons birthday and within a week he went back to his old AirPods with the stalks saying the new AirPods Pros didn‚Äôt fit no matter which tips he used. UGG!! $250 down the drain. He said and I agree they really don‚Äôt sound any better than the old AirPods. The noise cancellation is noticeable BUT no where near as effective as noise cancellation on his over the ear Sony 1000XM2. Even with the AirPod Pro noise cancellation on you can still hear surrounding voices but they are muffled. Having both the old AirPods and the AirPod Pros I can tell you the Pros are not worth upgrading to.  I would also try a pair before I bought them because the fit is hit or miss.,3,1,2019-12-28,1,1,0
"These headphones are absolutely awesome. The noise cancellation is amazing and the sound quality is very good. The battery life of the earbuds themselves could be better however the speed that they recharge in the charging case makes up for it. Being able to easily switch between devices with these headsets (when you have all Apple devices) is incredibly fast and it makes using regular bluetooth pairing extremely painful. I was also amazed with how well other people could hear me with almost no wind noise being picked up by the microphone even while biking at around 20 MPH.With all of this said, I ended up having to return these. Why? Because they were excruciatingly painful to wear in my left ear. I tried every size tip, I tried buying (overpriced) foam tips, and no matter what I did my left ear would hurt quite badly at the end of the day after wearing these headphones. If you can wear these headphones all day without pain then these are the best headphones you can get, unfortunately I can't so these aren't for me.",3,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0
"...you get what you pay for.  I'm not an audiophile or anything like that but I was surprised at how good these sounded when I first sampled some music.  Especially the base reproduction.  But maybe most buds that fit in this way are similar.  So, for the price, I feel a little less pain now.I was worried about having a defective pair since the buds themselves were only at 50% out of the box.  But after thinking about how the charging probably works I think I figured it out.  Sitting on the shelf, the buds will loose charge normally.  The case will not use all of its charge to KEEP them at 100%.  It probably shuts off after they first reach 100% and does not re-engage until the lid is opened/closed - which is what I did after opening the package.  Not long after that I pulled them out of the case and they were at 100% and the case had dropped a small percentage.",4,1,2020-8-30,1,0,0

"The active noise cancellation is good enough to let me listen to podcasts or music while I mow the lawn.  They fit inside my earmuff style hearing protection, which was still not sufficient to hear much of anything with my old wired earbuds.  Not anymore, with these.  In less noisy situations, it pretty much silences everything except whatever audio I'm playing.  Kind of eerie, but also very calming.  I don't think I'm ready to use the noise cancellation while walking down the street, as I can't hear the cars until they are right behind me.  Luckily it's super easy to toggle the noise cancellation.  These are my first wireless headphones, which is making me realize just how often the cable used to get in the way, or get yanked out of my ears.  I haven't tried the new positional audio thing yet.  I don't think it matters to me, but if you watch tv or movies on your phone it is probably really cool.  If I didn't care about the noise cancellation, I would have gotten the cheaper non-pro aidpods, but I really do like that feature.  I know a lot of people were mad at Apple for ditching the headphone jack a few years ago, but I honestly can't see myself using wired headphones with my phone ever again.

It seems the mic and speakers are trying to compensate for noise, but it is doing too much and creating a popping sound and white noise. The popping sound is enough to create a slight disturbance, it similar to when you may yawn and hear popping in your ear. However, this one does not feel so good as your ears are not relieving pressure.

The noise cancelling could be a little better but pretty good for ear buds. All in all, I‚Äôm kicking myself for not buying these sooner.",5,1,2020-8-5,1,1,0
"I was always on the fence about buying these because ear buds like these always tend to fall out of my ears after a short time. So far the only time these have falling out are when I hit my ear from the back or I forget they are in and take my shirt off. The noise cancellation option does work great. It doesn't block everything, but it does bring all the noise down to a very low rumble allowing you to concentrate more on what you need to do. I also tried the option where you can use them as hearing aids. When I say they work great at that is an understatement. I had someone stand about 150 feet away from me and talk in a normal to low voice and heard every word they said. However, when using them as a hearing aid. There is so much constant background noise coming through the air pods that you could only leave them on for a short time while trying to use them as a hearing aid. So you would have to turn this option on every time you needed to use it and off as soon as you are done with it. Otherwise the constant background noise will become very distracting. Also don't try to talk while having them on as a hearing aid. Your own voice gets amplified tremendously. I had to lower the volume before speaking and then turn them back up when trying to listen to the person talking. So I wouldn't really recommend using them for hearing aids unless it was a last resort. The only other problem I don't like about them is the connection via blue tooth between devices. When I want to use them for my laptop. I had to disconnect them from my phone and connect them to my laptop and visa versa when going back to my phone. If there is a way for them automatically switch between devices I haven't learned how to use them like that yet. But if they don't, that is something Apple may want to look into doing. I figure if my $60 plantronics headphones can do it a pair of $220 airpods should be able to do it as well. Other than that I really like these.",5,1,2020-9-2,1,0,0
"But I'm actually really impressed. I had an old pair of bluetooth noise cancelling I got for free at an event that were worn down. I was nervous about these because they're so expensive. They're definitely worth it. The noise cancelling is great, especially because I have multiple air conditioning window units that are a lot of background noise. I've had some issues with my ears getting used to them and being irritated but over time that's gone away. Sometimes I feel like the seal isn't great in my right ear but it's nothing awful. I definitely think there's needs to be a smaller size than the small silicone cover. One thing that drives me nuts is when I answer phone calls, it never goes straight to my airpods, even when I had something playing with them when the call came in. It's always a few second delay of me trying to switch the sound back to airpods.",5,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"I thought these would be an occasional use item. After having them for a month, I have used them every single day. They make great phone calls, the noise cancelling blocks 75-80% of the noise, but the game changer for me was the previously unknown to me ‚Äútransparency mode‚Äù. I can listen to my music and still be fully in tune to my surroundings. They even talk back to the Health app. Stove to iPhones and let me know my volume level is in a safe place. $250 is a premium price, but I have found them to be worth it.",5,1,2020-2-10,1,1,0
"I am enjoying using this product. The sound quality is good enough.  I listen to music and Podcasts and don't notice any difference between it and the old Apple headphones I had.I really like the hands free aspect. The battery life seems to be pretty long the charging packages good. It was a little tricky  To pair the ear phones to my smartphone but it did work eventually and hasn't had any problems with That since then.  Don't get frustrated keep trying.  The 1st set of headphones  had a problem, one of the headphones would overheat and feel hot on my ear.  I returned them to the vendor and they promptly replaced them with a good pair. Since the  Product is somewhat new I would excuse that but definitely send them back in if you have this problem it's worth it to get a new pair that works. It's nice to know that they stand behind their product. Really the cost Is worth it.",5,1,2020-6-9,1,0,0
"Let me start off by saying these are a solid pair of wireless earbuds. The sound quality is the best I‚Äôve heard from earbud style headphones and the battery life is as advertised (~5 hours depending on volume and ANC). These things also hold very well in my ears and I don‚Äôt have an issue with them falling out. My biggest complaint comes from the active noise cancellation feature. I live in a rural area where essentially all the noise in my bedroom comes from an air purifier. The ANC feature significantly reduces the noise of the air purifier compared to passive mode, but it doesn‚Äôt reduce it to the point where I‚Äôm impressed for the price. I‚Äôve seen complaints about the current firmware reducing the effectiveness of ANC (these ones shipped with the most recent firmware installed and there‚Äôs no way to revert to the old firmware apparently). If that‚Äôs the case, then I hope Apple will crank the ANC capabilities back up in a future firmware update because these would then be an unbeatable pair of wireless earbuds. All in all,  I like these things, but unless the ANC issue gets worked out I‚Äôm thinking I would have been better off getting 2nd gen AirPods over the Pros. That being said, I will hold onto them in hopes Apple will improve ANC in a future update.",4,1,2020-2-21,1,1,0
"The noise cancelling is awesome, and don't believe you'll find better in a ear bud.  The fit is much more secure and stable as they sit inside your ear rather than kind of balancing/hanging on the outside. They are noticeably more comfortable in the ear - and the 3 sizes of tips allow for a more individual fit.  The big test will be exercising, but even just wearing them around and trying to shake my head from side to side they seem to stay in well.  I've also ordered ""memory foam"" tips, which will hopefully help the stability and sound even more.I like the ""transparency mode"" for normal activity, so you don't get hit by a bus and/or you can hear people.  The noise cancelling is that good - it is immediately noticeable when changing over and blocks out the majority of noise, especially if music is playing at a medium or high level.  I suspect these would be great on a plane!",5,1,2020-5-6,1,0,0

"Edited: replacements work great.Got mine in yesterday and was so excited. The AirPods came charged so I used them right away. When I was done for the night, I put them on the charger in their case. It said AirPods-50% and Case-100%. This morning, I‚Äôve tried multiple cables and the light doesn‚Äôt come on at all. Won‚Äôt pair. Won‚Äôt work. Reset does nothing. Super disappointed and I will update when my replacement comes in. Says it will be a WEEK üò© Nothing positive to say right now besides I enjoyed the sound the couple hours they worked.

"Regular Apple AirPods or EarPods do not stay in my ears for a second. They just fall out. My ears don‚Äôt have a little ‚Äúpocket‚Äù at the bottom, like a lot of people. I was hoping the new AirPods Pro would fit better. I found the sound quality and noise cancellation features to be fantastic, but I had difficulty with them ‚Äúfalling out‚Äù of my ears for no real reason. For a male, who spends time ‚Äústanding over water‚Äù, this was a scary proposition. Bottom line: I had to return them. Previously, I had a pair of Jabra 65t earbuds, which are very good, but not as good as the new AirPods Pro. So, now that I can‚Äôt wear the AirPods Pro, I‚Äôm going to try the new Jabra Elite Active 75t earbuds. Features similar to the AirPods Pro.

"Short and sweet review here. Sound quality is very nice. Not the best I've ever heard, but solid none the less. The buds themselves are very comfortable and don't fall out. Noise cancellation is surprisingly very good for earbuds. The touch controls so far are a bit wonky, but I'll probably just control everything from my phone anyway. My only gripe thus far is the case. It's nice and the magnetic closure and magnets that hold the buds are great. However the lid moves ever so slightly back and forth when closed and makes this little clicking noise. Seems like a design flaw that makes it feel a bit cheap. Not the end of the world or a deal breaker though. I've seen other reviews that mention it too. Are these worth the price tag? Not so sure just yet as I've only had them for a day. But with the convenience of Amazon's return process, it's worth a shot if your on the fence. I had some gift cards to blow so I said screw it and bought them. No buyers remorse though, I'm happy with them.",5,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
"So if you are like me and music, crisp, sounding music is important and you have been kicking the idea of Apple Airpod Pros, go for it. I never bought the true wireless AirPods because the ones that came with the phones were so uncomfortable. Last year I bought the Bose wireless. They had good bass but the left earbud would cut out and no noise cancellation. I‚Äôve learned not to buy the first model of a product because the better version will be out later. So with the Apple Pros. Yes I used part of my stimulus check to buy headphones but I use them all the time.  Ut to the chase. Fit is great with option of ear tips. Noise cancellation is great, and all highs, mids, and low are awesome. Definitely recommend.Ps. The noise cancellation is so good, that I had to ask the wife, what(?) cause I couldn‚Äôt hear her like she has learned to tone me out. Lol. Gt",5,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0

Well for the price point. I was expecting a whole lot more. To me $250 is not a lot for a great pair of headphones. However I lost my $40 pair that I absolutely loved from a brand I can‚Äôt remember that I got on here. I got these hoping that I‚Äôll be blown away and not want anything else. I simply did not happen. The sound quality is that of any other headphone I‚Äôve ever had. So why pay so much more. All the features this does is absolutely amazing. Paired easily there was no White noise entering. However my $30 ones did the exact same thing. The only thing I did not do of course with all the Apple functions. I didn‚Äôt mind losing my $40 pair I think I would mind a lot if I lost these knowing that they were so expensive and they didn‚Äôt even sound better than my $40 pair. I understand why a lot of people will want these it‚Äôs simply not me. Really think about it. You can get just as good sounding earbuds from a lot of other companies. I sent these back. And don‚Äôt regret it at this point.I just picked up a $30 pair which I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll love.,3,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
"It‚Äôs about time Apple made headphones for the rest of us, normal Apple EarPods and headphones have never fit well in my ears.Overall these work pretty well.  The sound is good, not super amazing.  The ANC is good overall, it works best on droning hum type of sounds, and not very well on sudden sounds like clapping or a door shutting.  When I wear them next to my furnace it entirely cuts out the furnace, but if the microwave were to beep I would hear it.  So it‚Äôs a mixed bag, but for airplanes or loud fans or sitting next to a server room, these work great.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"These headphones are a game changer for working from home during COVID-19! I bought them because I have three shared, thin walls in my apartment that result in significant background noise from neighbors (i.e. stomping, thuds, talking, cabinets/doors slamming, kitchen sounds, etc.). The regular AirPods and my Taotronics over-the-ear active noise cancelling headphones I have didn‚Äôt make a significant difference in reducing sound. However, the noise cancelling feature in the AirPods Pro drowns out neighborly noise to allow me to focus during the work day. These headphones are especially useful for tuning in to video conferences and phone calls without disruptive background noise. I also love the AirPods Pro for listening to podcasts, music, and guided meditations to unwind. On Fourth of July, I was impressed that these headphones cancelled out most of the loud noise from fireworks throughout the neighborhood.Note that the AirPods Pro don‚Äôt cancel all noise, but about 70% of it. I can still hear high-pitched sounds (birds chirping, a neighbor turning on a squeaky faucet, etc) ‚Äî albeit at a lesser volume ‚Äî when using the noise cancelling feature without listening to music. Utilizing noise cancelling with music playing tends to block the most sounds.",4,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"For this review I am not going to compare these to any other type of headphones only earbuds. Yes there are a few products out there that have slightly better sound performance however those are big bulky and ugly. Also they do not work cross platform or as amazingly with Apple products. Fit, comfort, sound, performance, and style. These have them all. Can‚Äôt wait to see what miracles Apple comes up with in future updates. Sky is the limit with these earphones. They seem to know what I‚Äôm doing and what I need. I‚Äôve actually had them automatically pause once I‚Äôve started a conversation. They are your assistant and your entertainer all in one. I got some memory foam tips and they just become a part of me. To date I don‚Äôt believe there are any other earbuds that integrate so well with Apple‚Äôs products as AirPods Pro.",5,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"The new Apple AirPods Pro are a nice addition to the Apple line up. The previous version is still a good product, but the addition of the noise cancellation feature is a nice addition. It takes a little getting used to, if you do not have a current pair of noise cancelling headphones.The new design is a nice feature as well. They are smaller in feature, and I find them to fit better in my ears then the previous versions due in large part to the soft, replaceable ear tips.",5,1,2020-3-28,1,0,0
"When I started looking for some bluetooth IEMs, I actually tried a couple other pairs before I went with these. I tried a smaller company that was known for their audio quality the first time around, with roughly the same type of tap buttons on the ears as the airpods. The bluetooth however was absolutely terrible. I ended up returning them and getting a pair of the powerbeats3's for the w1 chip. The bluetooth now was perfect, however the sound quality was absolute garbage and they still had the wire between the ears, which caught on my neck like it was covered in glue. I kept them for the gym, but they still couldn't replace my old wired set I was using to commute and at work.The airpods on paper looked like they could be the ones and I got a pair at the beginning of November. Given what I had dealt with from the prior pairs, they were exactly what I expected when they arrived. The sound quality is fairly average, but given the rest of the features and the solid connectivity of the w1, I could live with it. However, it's been 3 months now and I am starting to see build quality issues. The left one started rattling a couple weeks ago like something was loose. I googled it and it looks like this issue wasn't just me in isolation. Apple was easy to work with. They switched out the left earpod only though, and shortly after the right ear also started to rattle. I would expect better quality. The problem may only hit 1/10 or 1/20 pairs, but given the price point of these I would expect better. I'll update in another 3 or 4 months with the new pair and see if maybe the ones I had were part of a bad batch.",2,1,2020-1-14,1,1,0
"My new go-to headphones. I‚Äôve owned the original AirPods and countless other wired, Bluetooth, and true wireless headphones. First, these are way more comfortable in my ears and I can wear them without (much) fatigue. Second, while these don‚Äôt sound the ‚Äúbest‚Äù...they‚Äôre only second to my custom in-ears (quads and dual drivers) and new Sony WH-1000XM3s. Third, I could definitely wear these for working out/jogging, though I probably won‚Äôt‚Äîtoo afraid of one falling out and stepping on it‚Äîeven though they‚Äôre pretty secure. Finally, the noise-cancelling is awesome and I love how easy it is to enable transparency.

Amazon shipped these to me & first set was stolen out of the box.  The Amazon box it came in was sealed so someone took them at Amazon.  Got a credit & bought them $10 cheaper at wallmart.  Not sure I like them in my ear as much.  They are smaller so hard for large hands to hang on to.  I wear gloves all day outside & I can‚Äôt tap these new ones.

"Long story, short...I wasn't that excited to get these. It just wasn't at the top of the list of things I wanted to buy. I saw that everyone had them and assumed it was just a trend because it's an Apple product. I bought them because one night I was running and my head phones with the cord kept tangling and falling out. I had enough. So, I bought them. I absolutely don't regret it. I personally believe the hype is worth it.",5,1,2020-5-18,1,1,1
"Debated on spending the money for these.  My brother told me about a cheaper brand he'd bought, they were great, way less money, blah blah blah.  But I had already tried a cheaper version and they cut out and I had to return them.  Finally just buckled down and got these and LOVE THEM.  I love how I can open the case next to my iphone and a picture pops up telling me about battery life.  They were already hooked up to my phone - I didn't have to do anything (major plus for a non-techie like me).  I've had zero issues with them cutting out.  I typically use them when I'm mowing the lawn and listen to podcasts.  When I have the noise cancellation on, I CAN'T HEAR THE MOWER.  They're comfy, easy to put in, and I loooooooove not having the wire tethering me to the phone in my pocket when I'm  trying to mow.  No more getting tangled up when I grab the handle.

"It‚Äôs a good pair of earbuds but that‚Äôs about it. Mediocre in every aspect really. It gets the job done. I bought it because the microphone performance is better than competitors. However, I expect this to work better with apple products, being an apple product itself: it does not connect to two devices(ie. iPhone and iPad) at the same time. It‚Äôs so frustrating. It can pair multiple devices, but you can‚Äôt hit play on another device and AirPod switch to that device automatically, Bose can do it.If microphones is not your priority and you have this amount of money, buy the Sony 1000xm3",3,1,2019-12-18,1,2,0

Yes you can find earbuds that have better sound quality and noise cancelling, yes you can find earbuds that have a longer battery, yes you can find earbuds that are cheaper, but you will not find earbuds as complete as these are. These have the best combination of all of the above.Also, if you're like me and are concerned about not being able to hear yourself/sound like you're yelling when talking on the phone due to the noise cancelling feature and sealed off earbuds, don't worry because that is not an issue!! Transparency mode is incredible, I can hear myself perfectly as if I were using the regular apple headphones!

"I've been the owner of these Airpods Pro for a few months now. When I first bought them, I was wondering (as most people probably are) is it worth the price? The answer is yes and no. They have good sound quality, and the noise cancelling works well. I haven't had any problems with the sound quality so far. As a young teen girl I use the middle-size fitting, and I don't have an issue with them falling out. Some problems I've had with these Airpods  however is that they can disconnect randomly. This never happens when I use my Chromebook, but sometimes if I close an app while on my phone they can disconnect. I have a Motorola 7, which is an android, but I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the issue. Whatever the reason is, it can get frustrating when I have to turn my Bluetooth on and off again to get reconnected. Also, the battery life on the Airpod Pros is not very good. It only lasts a few hours before needing to be charged again. This is frustrating if you're like me and use your Airpods for school. Overall, I think these are handy and easy to use. But the price is a bit extreme. Though I enjoy using them and use them almost everyday, I think a more reasonable price for them is $150. However, I have no regrets buying these and will continue to use them.",4,1,2020-4-16,1,1,0
"These are no-brainers for people who use headphones regularly and are in Apple's walled garden. the H1 chip allows seamless integration, easy usage, and immediate connectivity. Battery life is good, while not all day like the Powerbeats Pro, the quick charge in the case gets the job done soon. The case is a bit larger (compared to the Airpods), but it's still vastly smaller than the Powerbeats Pro and others on the market. The Noise Cancelling is unparalleled to headphones in this size category, but the ""transparency"" mode is very good as well.The sound quality is very mid-range.

"I purchased the Sony WH100xm3 and these AirPods pro and compared them . I kept the AirPods pro. These aipods had a hissing sound when I play them out of the box, this later went away. The noise cancelation is not as great as Sony and Bose the cancelation is different and less powerful. But it is good and will block mist sound , the Sony tare also bulkier and huge on your head and they don‚Äôt fit in your pocket and come with a charging case and Apple ecosystem. The bass is still weak and sound similar close to regular AirPods but you can adjust it but still the s I be is better in the Sony but the portability in that small sound difference is still worth it in my book just look at how small they are. I like the controls in the ear it makes it easier than stopping your music by grabbing your phone or watch, Sony also has this feature but it‚Äôs only in one ear and you have to use your whole hand to change or pause I didn‚Äôt think that was as cool as the AirPods.

"I don't write reviews. Maybe I've written two in my life, and both have been because the product was SO BAD I felt compelled to warn others of my unfortunate experience. If a product works as advertised, I consider it living up to expectations, and not something to rave about. But the Air Pod Pro is different. I can't even describe the mind-blowing experience the first time I put them on. The sound quality is best described as superlative.  The noise cancellation is amazing. The ease of setup was easier than plug-n-play. It's as though they were pre-configured to work with my iphone, and amazingly once I had them set up with one of my Apple devices, it magically worked with all of the others. I could go on, but I think I've made my point. These are my second wireless ear buds. The first time I made the mistake of buying some cheap Chinese crap to save $75, but instead I WASTED $150.

The main reason I love them is their size, they're very portable and I barely even notice them sitting in my pocket when I'm on the go. On top of that their noise cancellation completely blew me away, I was happy to hear (or not hear.. get it? noise canceling?) that they had this feature but didn't expect it to work this well. I work in a loud lab with fans blowing on multiple machines at once and with the noise canceling active I barely hear any of it.Of course I do have some issues that are relatively minor to me. The first is with the 5% of the time I'm not using them with my phone, I use them on my windows PC, and for some reason they sound like I'm listening to them through a face mask, I honestly prefer using my 10$ wired headphones on my computer than my airpods.",4,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0
"These AirPods gave off the most toxic, nauseating fumes out of the box. I googled to see if this was an issue and saw that some people said their AirPods Pro smelled like blueberries. A berry fragrance would have been fine but this was not it. I got a terrible headache from the odor when I tried on the AirPods. I even suspected it might have been counterfeit but I checked, and they appear to be legit. It functioned fine.I would have returned them but my husband was fine with the smell.",3,1,2020-6-29,1,1,0
"Better than average sound quality and great for travel + working out. It stays in ear without causing ""ear fatigue"" - look it up - I didn't realize it was a thing until I tried the airpod pros and now leaving them in ear during flights is a non-issue (it was never a real big issue to begin with, but pretty cool that removing the plastic ear piece dramatically increases comfort).Only thing - I wish I could set custom settings for pressing the L or R ear piece vs them doing the same thing (yes I know you can make 1 transition from sound mode and the other to do siri, but I would like to keep both on sound mode but change which sound modes they default to). Still, overall it's a 5/5",5,1,2020-2-11,1,1,0

"I got them to see if there would be a difference between 1 gen and 2nd gen. Let me tell you that there is a huge difference. 1st the sound is pretty good in comparison. 2nd the noise cancellation is really good, 3rd I like how these stay in my ears compared to the other 2 generations. I am comparing them to the older generation as I have owned both. I head banged to Slayer to test them to see if they would stay in my ear and they did. I have only had them for a few hours and I am pleased with my purchase. I was skeptical in buying them, but I am glad I did. Within the last years I have purchased and returned the Jabra Elite 65t only because I could not get them to stay in my ear even with after market ear attachmeents. I also had and returned the Bose sound sport because of connectivity issues otherwise I would have kept those because the sound was phenomenal. Back to these AirPods Pro, its pretty cool to be able to listen to music and hear your surroundings.  I give this a 4 star rating overall. I hope this helps.",4,1,2019-12-27,1,0,0

"The two things that make these stand out for me are outgoing sound from the mic for phone calls and transparency mode. Both features are exceptional. The biggest drawback for me is tip retention when wearing them. To try to prevent them from falling off I have tried several aftermarket solutions without satisfaction including the $30 memory-foam tips. Based on reviews, however, I would say those of us that have this issue are in the minority so I would not let it discourage you from trying them out. Battery life is short compared to others but adapting to that is painless. When charge gets low I charge them one at a time while wearing the other. Since it only takes 5 minutes of charging for each one to get a decent charge this is not much or a drawback at all.",4,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
"Wow. I had no idea that the canals that go from the outer air to my ear drum were sized differently. But they are and the different sized rubber caps on the air pods made this work for me. Here is what would happen. I would have both AirPods in and only one of them, always the right-ear AirPod, would work its way out and fall out. I changed the rubber cap to a smaller version and the problem went away. The noise cancelling is excellent and the ability to hear and be heard during a phone conversation is excellent. Finally, I live in a condo and work from home, and work on an adjoining condo was  making a lot of noise. I put the AirPods in and turned a play list from my iPhone on, and problem solved.",5,1,2020-1-25,1,0,0

I tried several high-end earbuds that all cost more than $150. They all give me the same problem. They put pressure on parts of my ear that hurt over long periods of time.not with these.

"Great great product. Non biased to being an apple lover. I would say this is an amazing pair of headphones with great sound quality and noise cancellation, only draw back for me, is that having never owned any of the previous airpods I didnt know they dont stay in air during intense workouts or runs. So with this pair I thought ok it should stay and fit great etc, but on my 1st workout it fell out even with a perfect fit test. So I got myself some rubber accessories to wrap around my ear to workout with but with Alot of sweat they to slip off the ear and the airpods will fall. So if you're going to use these to workout, know the limits unless they absolutely dont fall out for you. Everything else though, is excellent",4,1,2020-3-24,1,1,0
"While they are quite expensive headphones, the quality is superb and, of course, it's apple. Much bigger improvement from the AirPods 2. The AirPods Pro have phenomenal noise cancelling ability.If you're shopping around for bluetooth headphones and have money to splurge, the AirPods Pro are a worthy contender. However, if you are more conservative with spending, I would consider maybe an alternative option. While they are great headphones, I don't think they are worth the very expensive price tag.",4,1,2020-1-5,1,1,0
"Perfection. Honestly though these are the best little wireless earphones and a big upgrade from the 1st generation of AirPods. They curve way more, have different earbud sizes to help with comfort and battery life of the case is AMAZING!! Not to mention you can charge it with a charging pad! Literally just place the case on the charging pad and BOOM, charges! But it also does come with a wire to charge. Also did I mention the noise cancellation setting is awesome?? Well it is, and perfect for zoning in work or meditating.

"Though sound stage and sonic performance doesn't come close to my Around Ear Sennheiser PXC-550 (for airline use) & BTNC 4.50 (rougher gym use). The Active Noise Cancellation of the open back Air Pod Pro compares quite well to these two BT Sennheisers' I own.  Granted, I would not use nor recommend this on a flight vs my PXC-550 (as one needs a full-on, Around Ear headphones, with passive noise isolation design of the ear cups and pads, to supplement the electronic ANC). Around Ear Headphones with ANC WINS EVERY TIME for flight use. No contest!)

I was really skeptical about buying these off amazon rather than Walmart or something like that especially because they were a lot cheaper but I just bought them anyway since the price was better here thinking I would jus return them if they were sketchy.

"I'm an Apple fan and have been for a long time. I was very disappointed with these. First, the sound quality isn't very good. There's not a lot of bass on music and music sounds really flat and bland with these. Second, the battery life doesn't seem to be that fantastic. I have a set of earbuds I use for workouts, from a competitor, and the battery life and sound quality are vastly superior. Finally, they seem to connect and disconnect randomly. I've had them not pick up on my phone for a minute or two and then pick up and drop at random. For the money, I expected a lot more and this is a purchase I truly regret.",3,1,2020-9-17,1,1,0
"I had a previous version of airpods and they were lost pretty quickly since they get loose within seconds while you are in a store picking something. Airpods pro will stay within your ear very well, it's expensive and definitely not worth 250 ( apple obviously knows how to price their products : ) but with not many alternatives I prefer them compared to other non-apple named options.

"I travel for work, and I am on conference calls often.  I am very disappointed in the AirPods Pro.  While sound is good, it seems that is only thing Apple focused and tested.  Here's what I've discovered over the past few months of daily use:* The noise cancellation is okay -- it certainly helps.  But it causes ear pain due to a very high pitch when not when there is not audio playing through, and it certainly doesn't silence the outside environment completely.",2,1,2020-1-25,1,1,0

"I want to love these so much. I did love these, actually- for almost a month I‚Äôve been using them daily - they‚Äôre incredible for the gym because I can phase out the sound of everything around me. They rocked, until the other day when I popped them in and one of the airpods was completely dead. I tried to see the battery level on my phone and couldn‚Äôt get my phone to pop the info up- had to add battery life to my widgets just to see that my R bud was 0%, and the case and L bud were 100%. I thought maybe I didn‚Äôt have them in the case correctly so I took them out, put them back in, and a little while later my L bud was now 1% and the R was 100%. It made no sense but it completely ruined my workout. I unpaired and paired, I left case plugged in- I did every trouble shooting method I could think of but nothing‚Äôs working. Returning these for a replacement (which Amazon says will take weeks to come in üò°) and if that doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôm going to buy directly from Apple and see if that makes a difference.

Then one side started moving due to sweat and moved up a size from medium to large earbuds even if I have to give up noise cancelling.

"Wow!  Got these Airpod Pros for my wife for Christmas (bought early in Dec). She had been using the second gen airpods and loved them (never had a problem).  She tried using them a week after Christmas.  Immediately, she started having problems connecting one airpod.  The other side seemed to work ok.  She continued trying to use them, but some days one airpod or the other would be dead (like it wasn't connecting to charge).  By the end of January, she took a trip to Atlanta and they were basically unusable - showed connected, but couldn't hear or be heard.  The other airpod side died after about 9 minutes, so basically L and R airpods were defective.  Would be on the charger all night- one would charge and the other one would not.  Tried to return them to Amazon and they said that the return time had expired even though it was a gift wouldn't return them, even though she had only used them for about 30 days.  Missed the window by two days.  I would be very very very careful ordering any electronic equipment from Amazon and if you have any problems send them back immediately (even if the problem seems very slight- if it gets worse, you won't be able to return).

Extremely comfortable fit over along time and a very detailed pleasing sound, using Spotify for music, that is not fatiguing, with a smooth high end and moderate bass heft‚Ä¶ The best part, compared to my more expensive in-ear units, the mid-range is wonderful and detailed.

"After having owned the original AirPods and absolutely loving them, these were a profound disappointment. I‚Äôll be honest, at first they seemed like a resounding improvement, both with sound quality, and functionality. Needless to say I‚Äôm back to using my old ones which still work great. The first generation was avant guard. I know they didn‚Äôt work properly with everyone‚Äôs ear archetype, but even when they felt they may fall out, they never did. The next generation although ostensibly brandishing new features (noise cancelation), would constantly fall out of my ear. What‚Äôs atrocious is the communication with the iPhone. I found myself constantly pressing ‚Äúforget device‚Äù and paring them back up so when opened, it would display the battery level. Toward the end of their ephemeral life ( yes they just don‚Äôt work anymore after only 8 months) they were wheezing and people could not hear me clearly. The last glitch before they became feckless was their inability to charge in sync. I can‚Äôt share how many times the next day I would plug them in my ear right before a workout and I would hear the deathly twinkle sound that the right ear bud was imminently about to die. My guess is Apple needed something new, threw in some noise cancelation feature, and redesigned them because that‚Äôs how they make money. I have owned apple products since before they were cool, and I always thought they would never sacrifice quality for flash and speed, but these air buds confound that sentiment. No way should close to $200 ear buds be rendered useless in 8 months, that‚Äôs just a swindle.",2,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0

Had Bose Q20 in ear noise cancelling earbuds which I LOVED but my dog chewed them up.  So I figured after 4+ years the wireless tech would have improved.  And is has!

"I ordered these hoping they were better than the first 2 versions of AirPods. They‚Äôre okay. I wish they had more bass. The regular sound is good. I bought the Powerbeats pro to try them out and decide which I like better, the beats had slightly better quality but the bass sounded artificial (I think now because apple owns them) compared to the beats x I had couple years ago. And the power beats pro charging case was just too bulky for me. I don‚Äôt think the AirPods Pro are as cracked up as the apple site and other online reviews makes them to be, I am definitely a bass chaser. I love the ability to go from noise cancellation to transparency. The charging case is the perfect size, I just wish the pods had higher battery capacity and had More bass, and for $250 you‚Äôd think they would. I decided to keep these instead of the Powerbeats pro. It‚Äôs surprising how you can put them in just like the original AirPods or EarPods and it‚Äôs sealed, No having to screw them in your ears like the competitors. And they‚Äôre comfortable.

"I just got my AirPod Pros. My daughter has the regular AirPods, but the earpiece was very uncomfortable for me so I never bought any for myself.  When these came out,  with a different style of earpiece,  I decided to treat myself.I like everything about them except for the fact that they came without a plug.  They can be charged with a wireless charger and they came with a cord, but the cord doesn't fit the standard plug.  I don't have a wireless charger,  and I don't have the special plug that fits the cord, so I've ordered one.  No big deal, it didn't cost a lot,  but I wish I had understood this before I ordered the AirPods so I could have ordered the plug to come with it.  This is a problem because right now, I have AirPods and once the initial charge wears off, they won't be usable until I get the special plug...  We're still on some COVID19 restrictions right now,  so I can't just rush out and buy one.  I have to order it and wait for it to arrive. .  I'm not happy about that but I love AirPods.

"I bought these because of the interconnection features between Apple devices and I love them.  However there are two things I will gig them on.  When I call someone with Noise Cancellation on I can not hear what is around me but the person I called can hear everything around me just fine.  Also they did not stay in my ears well so I bought some foam ear tips and that seem to fix the issue  I love the transparency mode I have had the top end Bragi earbuds and some Bose earbuds and the transparency on these are game changing.  When transparency is on it is just like not having anything in your ear and allows me to keep them in more often.  There are many other features that are awesome as well but that is the highlights (text reading, button programming etc.).  The sound is very good but my Bragi and Bose I would rate slightly higher.  Bragi is out of business now so it might be hard for others to compare.",4,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0
"I am a fan of Apple's products and felt compelled to splurge on the AirPods Pro now that I am working remotely full time. For the past couple of years, I have used Bose SoundSport earbuds for exercising and am used to that fit and sound quality. For work calls, I had typically used the Apple EarPods (wired) out of the iPhone box. These are great for calls because they don't plug up your ears while you talk, whereas the Bose SoundSport earbuds fit to always block outside noise.After a few weeks of using the AirPods Pro, I found myself always having the 'Transparent' setting turned on in order to switch between music and calls. This function drains the battery, but also seems to be a feature that was served without needing a special setting in the earbud for the base level AirPods/EarPods. I guess my point is that the key to AirPods Pro is the noise cancellation for music, while also having the option to hear the outside world. Using the Bose SoundSport as a baseline for sound quality comparison, the AirPods Pro unfortunately finishes multiple rungs below the SoundSport purely for music audio quality. There is relatively little bass and while the noise cancellation feature improves sound slightly for use at home or in public places, it's virtually useless on an airplane in-flight. Lastly, the 'sock' tip for the AirPods Pro does not grip well when sweating during a workout, or even laying out at the pool and getting some sweat in the ear. While not sweating, the 'sock' tips just seem cheap and I often worry about the AirPods Pro falling out of my ears.",4,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0

Over ear does better when the music changes of course but during songs they are the same. Makes sense considering over ear is well, covering the ear. The sound is amazing. The transparency mode worked great in the airport and until liftoff and would be good for walking the dog and staying alert. The large rubber ear pieces fit me great and they didn‚Äôt fall out or get annoyingly loose at the gym. I bought a pair for myself too.",5,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0

I was looking for a ear buds/head set to take calls (working from home) and listen to music. Was about to buy the Air Pods as they fit my requirements but decided to go pro in the last minute. The pro easily met my requirements and the noise calling feature is surprising very good; did not expect this level of noise cancellation from a tiny ear bud. The pro also fits snugly to the ear and have not fallen off during trail walking or regular gym activities. Highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for noise cancellation without the bud and discomfort of a massive headset.,5,1,2020-9-25,1,1,0

Since she has been working exclusively from home since the pandemic, they have been her go to for daily conference calls and listening to music while working. Both her personal and work phones are iPhones, so the interface works perfectly. For comparison, i have a pair of Sony WH-1000X3's. While I love them for the quality, the interface is no where as smooth as the AirPods Pro when it comes to interfacing with both my iPhone and my iMac. Another great features is the multiple sized earpieces. This has allowed her to really customize the fit of them and maximize sound quality and comfort.The only complaint she has had is that she wishes the battery life lasted longer as they cannot make it through multiple daily conference calls. I recommend this product, especially for anyone already using apple products throughout their daily life.",5,1,2020-7-2,1,0,0
I was very skeptical to spend the bread on the AirPod Pros but I am glad I did. They are by far the most comfortable buds I have ever worn. They instantly link up with my Apple products by just opening the case within proximity to the device. Noise cancelation is not perfect but it does rival some over-the-ear style headphones I have used in the past; certainly the best noise canceling ear buds I have ever used! The squeeze function is very satisfying for using the noise cancelation function and skipping songs. Siri is eerily on point with taking commands to control volume and other features included with the pros.....even asking the battery percentage on the fly. I know these AirPods will be my primary listening companion for some time to come. 2nd best accessory next to the Magic Keyboard with track pad.,5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,1

Apart from that preference, the AirPods Pro is my favored all around earbud/headphone.  The noise cancellation you get in such a small package, with the convenience of the charging case for easy carrying, makes it a fantastic overall package.  Very happy with the noise cancellation, but also like the easy toggling of transparency mode by squeezing the stalk which pipes in outside sound from the world around you so that you can have a quick conversation (and then go back to blissfully tuning the noise out!).",5,1,2019-11-30,1,0,0
Excellent - my go to bluetooth buds for everyday listening and convenience. I am a high fi buff and wanted something tgat delivers great music quality. I will review in more detail on that later. Big need for great noise canceling MICROPHONE for conversations. Clarity and noise free conversations for those on other end was very important to me. I found inexpensive buds that were great for music considering price. Unfortunately none really deliver on quality conversations for phone use. This one has and no complaints. The one area that is sorely lacking however for me is my comfort level with silicone tips just don‚Äôt cut it. Painful is right word but thats me to. I have bony inside canals and foam is only thing that works consistently. I found solution and awaiting quality memory foam ear foam tips  and in mail. Will update after received. The silicone tips just didn‚Äôt cut it. In fact busted one trying to remove from buds after attempting to exchange out with other tips. Because of everything else so good i decided to fork out the dough for the memory foam tips based on reviews. Hopefully will come through on expectations. Will update then.UPDATE- pain greatly reduced by changing position in ear. I found a ‚Äòsweet spot ! By changing the post position - about 70 degrees from vertical. I don‚Äôt have much skin in ear - and bones conflict with slight oval seating of tip. I still thing memory foam will be ticket for best fit. But silicone tips can work in a pinch. Gotta play with them. Overall still a nice step up from standard under a hundred buds. Worth the extra price to me.,5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
"LOVE THESE! I upgraded to these after my periods AirPods got broken by my toddler and I am so so happy I decided to make the switch! Not only does the battery last me forever, the noise cancellation is AMAZING! I wear them with noise cancellation on even when I‚Äôm not listening to anything just because it is that good. They are super comfy in my ears as well! Not to mention, they don‚Äôt fall out nearly as easily as the standard AirPods tend to do!",5,1,2020-7-5,1,1,0
"Apple has finally added an addition to the AirPod family and I believe it deserves the ‚Äúpro‚Äù name.It‚Äôs slam-packed with features including noise-canceling, transparency mode, and finally, some touch-sensitive controls on the AirPods. Sit back and enjoy the review.",5,1,2020-1-14,1,2,0
"When I first opened up my package, the AirPods weren‚Äôt even in the box. But I could forgive that.then I saw that there was hair and fuzz all over the ear buds. So I just wiped the buds down and made sure it was clean.",1,1,2020-4-22,1,2,0
"I had high hopes for these, as a potential replacement for my Bose noise cancelling headphones when traveling. VERY disappointed. First, the noise cancellation, when you can get it functioning, is laughable compared to the Bose. I would estimate about ‚Öì the efficiency at cancelling ambient noise on airplanes, nowhere near adequate to promote relaxation in that environment. But most important, these things lose the iPhone audio connection all the time. Often the audio stream just stops, and you have to fiddle around to get it started again.  Or else the Bluetooth connection gets lost, or on the plane, where there are many other people with Bluetooth connected devices, the AirPods ""Pro"" just get confused about what they should connect to. Altogether a completely unusable product. (My wife and) I have tried multiple solutions to the audio disconnect issues as noted on the web, and nothing helps. Hopeless.",1,1,2020-5-8,1,1,0
"Sound is good, and I love all the features, like transparency (lets EXTRA noise in) so you can work with them in if you need to be able to hear people. I work around loud machinery so the fact that I can go from this mode to noise cancellation instantly was the selling point for me. Very Simple to use with iPhone.Bass is unimpressive, even turned all the way up on equalizer, which is disappointing. Sound quality still good overall, just doesn‚Äôt deliver on the bass. I‚Äôve had much cheaper headphones with better bass so I don‚Äôt see why Apple couldn‚Äôt have delivered on this.",4,1,2020-7-2,1,1,0
"Product does not stay in your ears if you‚Äôre talking, eating, or in general. This is because of the silicon in ear ‚Äúgrips‚Äù. There are other type of ear grips sold online from other shops that do a way better job than the default Apple ones. Noise cancellation isn‚Äôt as good as others. The best quality I could say about this product is the batter life and the portability. I prefer the Sony WH-1000XM3 over these for comfort, ease of use and REAL noise cancelling.",1,1,2020-7-22,1,1,0
"I don‚Äôt how Apple does it but they keep producing market leading products like these earphones. These earphones are outstanding. Love the noise cancelling function at the press of a button. Who comes up with this technology?? Amazing. I buy / try a lot of different earphones - Bose, Jabra, Sony. These Apple earphones are, by far, the beet I have i have owned. Not cheap. But you get what you pay for.",5,1,2020-3-12,1,1,0
After about 20 minutes they pop out of my ears. I‚Äôve spent so much time looking for these stupid things. My Airpods never fell out of my ears while walking or sitting. Doesn‚Äôt matter what size of ear tips I use. They sound great but what good are they if they won‚Äôt stay in your ears?Update May 1st 2020 - after a firmware update they disconnect constantly but not both at once.  Usually the right air pod pro disconnects followed by the left about 3-4 minutes later.  I can‚Äôt even use them for conference calls or music because they just cause trouble. My wife‚Äôs do the exact same thing. We both have 2019 iPads and iPhone 11 pro‚Äôs. Very disappointed.,1,1,2020-1-17,1,0,0
I truly ordered these on a whim! I have never owned a pair of AirPods or AirPod Pros and I love them . Before I have own Bose truly wireless an the Skullcandy truly wireless an even though they are both good brands from expensive to cheap but if you want great wireless headphones I‚Äôd definitely buy these again. Supper easy to pair! Took less then 1 min battery life is great each headphone lasted about 31/2hrs straight out the box fully charged 4 hrs an 45min the noise cancellation is one of the best I really impressed lol sound quality is great from the highs to the base just some of the highest quality I have heard in a while! The weight of the headphones in the ears is awesome to I don‚Äôt even realize there in my ear!  So if your not on a budget an have the extra 50 or 60 bucks I‚Äôd choose AirPod pros with out a doubt! I hope this helped !,5,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0

"The AirPods Pro have performed in every regard as both advertised and as expected.  The only issue I had was with the right Pod which after 4 months quit recharging beyond 23% yet did not function either to use up that 23%.  I had to make two calls to Apple to seek help with the problem.  The first lasted over an hour and a half with most of it on hold and the woman who eventually took my call was completely incompetent and had no idea what she was doing.  I got no satisfaction and eventually just hung up in frustration.The next day I placed another call, quickly got a very helpful person who quickly assessed that my product was in fact defective, my 1 year replacement was active and a replacement Pod was appropriate.  She completed the necessary confirmation and set the wheels in motion.  Two days later I received the replacement right Pod and returned the defective one in the provided mailer.  Problem solved and all has worked well since then.",4,1,2020-4-23,1,1,0
"Sound quality and noise cancellation is excellent. However, as noted on many forums, there pop out of the ear repeatedly and fall out. They won‚Äôt stay put, no matter which ear tip you use. Many have no choice but to return them. Incomplete product by Apple.",1,1,2020-2-26,1,2,0
These are a pleasant surprise in that I can wear them for long periods with absolutely no discomfort whatsoever.Sound is good -- not as good as full over-the-ear headphones and noise cancelling the same -- good but not perfect. I like that the pods connect seamlessly with my iPhone.,5,1,2020-2-18,1,1,0
I would have given this product 5 stars overall except for the fact that it includes a ridiculous charging cord.  The pods are expensive enough and if you want to use the included cord you will need to purchase a different power adapter.  Ridiculous!  If Apple is going to change the design of its charging cords at the very least the company can include the appropriate power adapter so you can use the cord.,3,1,2020-7-3,1,1,0
These are the most poorly designed product I have ever used.Pros.,1,1,2020-1-5,1,2,0
"At this price point, these earbuds needed to be perfect in order to get 5 stars from me.  Unfortunately, they were not perfect.  The noise cancellation feature did not meet my expectation.  I've had several Bose noise-canceling products before, so those were the baseline against which I judged these Airpods Pro.  And I can tell you that while the sound quality is actually perfect, these Apple Airpods Pro left quite a bit to be desired when it comes to noise cancellation.  Too much white noise when this feature is turned on.The battery life also needs to be a bit better if you are going to price your product like this.",4,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0

"I had the original Airpods but I couldn't run any outdoor equipment like a mower and still hear them. The active noise cancelling feature is simply outstanding. It eerily silences everything around you. The mower can still be heard but barely. Other reviews say the audio quality isn't the best available but I think it's excellent, although I'm no expert either. One feature I miss is the tap controls of the original pods. It's beyond me why they got rid of it but the squeeze controls are nowhere near as convenient. Overall, I would highly recommend these.",5,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"Good: form factor, instant connect easy to put on. Sounds okay not exceptional pairs well with windows. Noise cancellation is so so. Call clarity from other side is good battery life fine not sure if it is as advertised.Bad: noise cancellation is not the best there are better, sounds not a wow. Slips out of my ear fear of disappearing after the fall, no volume control on ear tips , I do get ear fatigue after long wear",3,1,2019-12-20,1,1,0
"Maybe the problem is with expectations. When you pay a premium price for a product such as Apple the expectation is fairly high. However, the AirPods continually fall out of my ears regardless of adjustments. The battery life is surprisingly short although this again might be more of an issue with expectations than actual battery life. The Bluetooth connectability is very good between apple products. The noise-cancelling is reasonable. All in all the price is high for what the product provides in my opinion",4,1,2020-6-25,1,1,0
"It's good.  Why are you reading another review about this?  You know it's the best, just get them!  I am an audiophile and sound engineer from years back.  I still have hearing acuity in the 20hz to 21khz range and I am kind of 'older'.  I am so picky, you have no idea.  I can easily hear the difference between a standard CD 44khz samples and a 192khz version of the same recording in 16 bit or 24 bit.  And with these, I can hear the difference in my HD content easily.  The airpods did not have this sound when I tried them.  But these airpod pro definitely live up to the hype.  Are they as good as my wired headsets?  No.  But very respectable for in-ear 'cans'.  Also, voice calls and the way it syncs up with my iphone Xs Plus has been flawless.  I tried others and I just have just listened to the hype and saved the money spent on the other, lesser, bluetooth earbuds. (Creative buds sounded pretty good but fell apart and would not always sync!)  I am very happy with these!",5,1,2020-8-7,1,0,0
"I‚Äôm an Apple junkie and have looked forward the Pro headphones. For in-ear headphones, the noise cancellation works well. It‚Äôs actually remarkable given how small the headphones are. They also stay in my ear well while working out. This wasn‚Äôt true with the older AirPods. The only slightly disappointing thing about the headphones is the sound quality. It‚Äôs very good, but not as good as the previous AirPods. Not a huge deal as the sound is still amazing, just slightly disappointed. Overall, a great product.",4,1,2019-11-25,1,2,0
"She loves them.  What can I say, they're Apple so they work as they should. Pairing is super easy. Noise cancellation is a great feature and works well.

"After about four months, they started to make a ""scratching"" sound in the left ear.  Went to Amazon to check out warranty, but since I am four months out they redirect to Apple.  Went to an Apple store, they told me to download app and it would synch the serial number and I could submit a RMA for a replacement, overnight!  Apple App does not pick up the serial number when synched.  So, when purchases made on Amazon do not synch with your Apple account.  Now, made second appointment with Apple store, outsourced to Best Buy because they are overloaded and  website won't schedule appointments further than one week, but due to CV19, no one can get an appointment at an Apple store.Summary:",1,1,2020-7-3,1,0,0

Bought the pros (because my brother did!) and these are perfect.  Fit is right on. I had to change to the larger caps after performing the sound test, and now I never have to touch them.  Plus, the sound canceling is SCARRY!  I turned it on while driving and it felt like I was flying! Remarkable.  Highly recommended.  Worth every penny.  Battery life could be a bit longer but I've yet needed it to be.",5,1,2020-9-4,1,0,0
"After testing several sets of earbuds I decided to give airpods a try. I hate the fit and feel of in-ear canal earbuds, but the airpod pro's don't go inside tha ear canal, instead, they form a seal on the outside. It's like a hybrid of in-ear and semi-in ear. These fit great! I'm an android user and have never owned an apple phone. They connect seamlessly with my Note 10. I also downloaded assistant trigger from the play store and can now take advantage of the same features available with iOS products for the airpods. If you're an android user airpods will work for you.",4,1,2020-4-29,1,1,0
"I decided to make the switch to the AirPod pros after I lost my first-gen AirPods. I was skeptical reading the reviews but went with it anyway. I'm not super tech savvy, but here are a couple of changes I've noticed!Likes:",5,1,2020-7-16,1,0,0
"It's very comfortable first of all, and the sound quality is like 2x better than the AirPods. There is no questioning that. And it's straight for, ward and its already pre set up for you and the connection from the start when you first paid it; it's straightforward it catches on real quick, and you don't need to press down a button like the first and the second generation did. The only bad part about the new airport pro is that since the noise cancelation is already pre set up for you, so there is no way for you to change the set up to something like the next song or pause or skip like the 1st and the 2nd generation had. The only this it has is and already pre set up is that if you press either AirPods, it will pause the song, and if you hold the AirPods, it will turn off/ turn on the noise cancellation. But other than that it's excellent!",5,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
I‚Äôve had two pair of these now. I‚Äôve returned both.The first one had annoying crackling noise. The second one constantly disconnected and reconnected.,3,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0
I've had a hard time finding decent sounding earbuds. Sound quality is important. These are better then the expensive bose I have had for years. The noise cancelling is amazing. Didn't think ear buds could ever compete on that level with  headphones that actually enclose the entire ear. But when these kick in you can't hear any normal noise levels. Great product,5,1,2019-11-21,1,1,0
"I recently bought the Sony WF-1000XM3 noise cancelling earbuds (and then lost them :-( ) and most of the reviews say the Airpod Pros' sound is not as good as the Sonys - from my point of view the Airpod Pros are FAR better!!! In fact the APs are better in every way for me - better sound, better noise cancellation, smaller case, better fit, lighter. The Sonys just DID NOT WORK for phone calls (iPhone) - callers complained about poor audio on every call I made, so I stopped using them entirely for calls. I need to make more calls with the APs, but the integration to the iPhone is very tight, so I'm expecting good things (I have colleagues who live on the phone and say they work well?!). Buy the APs, you won't regret it!",5,1,2019-12-18,1,1,0
"I have both the AirPods Pro and Sony WF-1000XM3 (spoiler alert: they sound the same) and with an iPhone the extra features the AirPods give outweigh the Sony‚Äôs by a mile surprisingly. Both earbuds a sound amazing, although if you use an iPhone you have to use the AirPods Pro since the Sony‚Äôs have connection issues due to the companion app. The AirPods don‚Äôt have this (since the extra features are built into iOS)",5,1,2020-5-18,1,1,1
"After our heavy Sennheiser headset, with full surround, hard bass and crisp trebles, these air Pod Pro buds are brilliant. The headset gave me a neck and head ache.

They are an amazing technology and well crafted.",5,1,2020-9-24,1,1,0
"We all know how seamless Apple is with the software integration of their products. This isn't even worth mentioning. If you want something that ""just works"" and money isn't an issue, get these.However I was unlucky enough to be one of the few whose ears just don't agree with the airpod shape. Which is a shame. They caused my ears quite the amount of pain after only half an hour of listening so I had to return them.",4,1,2020-3-7,1,1,1
I am a big fan of Apple products and have been using iPhones for more than a decade now. I was waiting for the upgraded AirPods to replace my second-generation AirPods.  It is definitely worth the wait. Apple AirPods Pro is amazing and sound quality is outstanding with noise-cancellation. It fits perfectly on my ears. I will listen to music at least 2 to 3 hours a day at work and battery life is really good. I will buy two more AirPods Pro for my spouse and son.,5,1,2019-11-18,1,2,0
"Before these I had the AirPods 1. If you have both at the same time you might be able to tell that the sound quality is better on the Pros. Noice cancellation and transparency mode are nice features but I would recommend buying over the ear headphones if you want to reach a high level of noise canceling. Also, on the second day I got them I was on transparency mode and I noticed that the left AirPod was not on transparency mode and then I tried a few things and it still did not work. I searched this issue on YouTube and Google and it‚Äôs something that happens to many users. The issue resolved it self within a few hours (idk how). One thing I like a ton more about the AirPods 1 is the shape. Sometimes I would forget they were in my ear. With the AirPod Pro my ears would get tired easily (yes I tried all the three sizes). So all in all I‚Äôm actually returning these and getting the AirPods 2 :)",4,1,2020-9-10,1,1,0
So it seems odd to have a charging cable with a type 3 on one side and the Apple connection on the other. Where do I plug it in? I have to buy another charger with the connection to use. I will and talked to an Amazon rep who made it right. But seems easier to just include something useable right out of the box. The headphones are fantastic I was mowing my lawn and turned on for noise cancellation and was able to talk to my friend while mowing the lawn with a gas mower. That part of it is amazing. But I just bought for two 4999 and the price has dropped by 16% it says. Sad for me,4,1,2020-7-8,1,0,0

I work in a lab and find it incredibly convenient to be able to set timers, read my text messages, respond, change what‚Äôs playing etc without having to take off my gloves. To the people who are bothered by not having sound adjustments on the actual ear piece... if you‚Äôre in a situation where you can talk, just tell Siri ‚Äúturn down/up the volume.‚ÄùI‚Äôll also add that I have -never- liked Apple earphones and whenever I got a new phone or iPod I‚Äôd just give them away because even wearing them for a few minutes would make my ears hurt and sore for a day or two.

"(Con)-comes with a usb c to lightning cord, but NO ADAPTER (which costs 30-50$ separately from apple) to plug into the outlet. So can only charge it with my iphone‚Äôs adapter. This cord it came with is useless to me since I have no macbook, but if you have a macbook u will see this cord as a positive+ noise cancelation is pretty good sometimes. Drowned out vending machines, but not the fan-system at my job for some reason. So at least I can use them in the lunchroom, but not where I actually needed noise cancelation.",4,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
"I wanted to get these because of the small sleek design, and wow what an incredible sound quality and noise cancellation .  I also own a pair of beats studio 3 headphones super nice quality headphones as well just not the same in size and although bass tends to sound better with the studio 3 headphones, its almost expected due to the over the ear design and size . Although i haven't wanted to use my beats since ive purchased these Airpod pros they are incredible . The battery life is great wireless charging is nice and the Noise cancellation is so good i cant hear  a thing when its turned on . and easily switched to transparency mode by holding the post. find my airpods feature is great as well .  doesnt come with charging box which seems problematic for some but i own a macbook pro so i just can use that box if needed, although i only charge with wireless charging pad.  I totally recommend this purchase if you have the extra bucks. Apple is of course always spendy, but remember you get what you pay for!  2 months later im still super pleased with my purchase.. only negative i will say is when in noisy locations like public transit phone calls are hard to make with them in because of the background noise is picked up so extremely well . Other than that i have no probs with them ... oh and Amazon wont ship this item to locker for some reason which is inconvenient.",5,1,2020-3-15,1,0,0
"Theres literally only one problem with the ear buds and its compared to the normal apple headphones, the changeable ear buds slide out of your ears. It comes with different sizes so you can play with it a little bit, but they have a tendency to slide out. I was going to give it 4 stars because of it, but to be honest if you can get it in right, it doesnt happen.Other than that, everything else about them is a perfect! hence the five stars I have plenty of noise cancelling headphones, none of them have the technology like this. Its like if you had a TV remote and hit the mute button on the world. Its a DRASTIC difference and the audio is crystal clear.

If I keep them still, i don't notice the pain, but if I am working out and have to push the earbuds back in or readjust them, it hurts. And I also notice scabs on that spot that hurts after overdoing it for a few days.The earbuds functionality is great though. So as long as ear size works, these are excellent.",4,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0

"Let me preface by saying that i've never owned previous Airpods, and my experience has been with Sennheisers, Bose, Sony for noise-cancelling headsets (the large cans).The Airpods Pro don't win any award for sound quality, but they're amazing for the portability and usability factor. In my previous trip to Europe (over 10 hours flight), I took the Airpods Pro and the Sony Xm3 (large cans with amazing sound quality), I found myself using the Airpods A LOT more than I thought I would.",5,1,2020-1-4,1,0,0
"I have sampled a ton of headphones over the years. I am a runner, mountain biker and avid outdoors man. I also do a great deal of outdoor work such as mowing, fertilizing and chainsawing. Not to knock other big name brands, but I have tried most of the ones that are listed as high dollar and supposedly the ""best"". For some, maybe so, but I have an extra issue on fit of the headphone. I was a very active wrestler and coach for many years and have what is called cauliflower ear. It misshapes the outer ear and makes it hard for headphones to stay put.Even with over the ear loops, the phone generally would work its way out and I would be left trying to replace it while running, riding or with dirty hands working. These little boogers just stay put and you don't even feel them in the canal as they are so little and light. The noise cancellation is mind boggling - a full volume lawn mower is essentially muted when switched into the cancellation mode. Going back to transparency mode allows you to carry on as needed with conversation or for things you need to hear.

"I love AirPods. Unfortunately, my last pair did not survive the assault by my washing machine and dryer. So I decided to upgrade and to my dismay, one of the earbuds gave off a horrid static sound. After much Google, I found out they just needed to be updated. Just stick the buds in their case, charge it, make sure they are connected to an iOS device with internet, and be patient-- the update will happen automatically. Now, the sound quality is as amazing as expected and the ANC is working flawlessly as well. A bit pricey, but worth it if you're an iPhone user.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
"I heard and saw lots of comments on how good AirPods Pro is, but from my perspective, it did not reach my expectations. First, I felt like the headphones would drop whenever I wore them. It seemed to me that my ears did not fit them well, so while I was wearing them, I had the feeling that they might just fall down on the ground though they didn't. Second, the noice cancellation that has been over-complimented by many people seemed to work only in spaces that do not contain lots of noice, for instance, your study or the library. Otherwise, you might still hear sounds on the street.However, the transparency mode worked quite well and unique for me though I still can't distinguish what's the difference between turning on the transparency mode and using a bluetooth speaker. This mode allows you to listen both the music and the surrounding voices, so you'll be able to notice what's happening around you while your music is still played.",4,1,2019-12-29,1,1,1
"Sound quality, these headphones are really nice. They are clear and pretty crisp. They are not too bass heavy, which I really don‚Äôt listen to too much bass heavy music anyway. The headphones connect SEAMLESSLY. Charge SEAMLESSLY.  The noise cancellation is honestly not as great as apple tries to portray it to be. Like if you are in a constant sound environment, sure things go silent(mostly ac), but when I‚Äôm at the gym I still hear a bunch of outside noise. (Nothing horrible). Then surprisingly I find my self using the passive hearing quite often.Also when I first got them it felt pretty weird because I was so used to wearing the regular skull candy earbuds with that plastic tip going into my ear with the silicone cover. Then with these it‚Äôs different, it feels weird at first, but you get used to it and not sure if it‚Äôs just habit or what but I want to continuously like push in the the ear bud, but no need they stay in.... I have had only like two times maybe where things disconnected from sound. I just put them in the case and bada bing things were back to normal. Also I sweat a lot at the gym and these are pretty great with it. When I say a lot I mean like I look like I jumped into a pool after the gym, but they don‚Äôt get affected from it. Also I had bought these after buying Powerbeats pro, which sucked so bad, (May have just been my experience) but yeah I returned those for these... also let me add a great charging system stupid fast.

"I love these ear buds. While working from home more often, I found I was using my phone much more and was frustrated by always being tethered to my phone with corded ear buds.

I also didn‚Äôt like Apple‚Äôs corded ear buds, as they were hard and hurt my ears, too. The Apple AirPods Pro solves the ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù problem, because they have soft, pliable covers over the ear bud. The sound quality is also great, and volume is plenty loud‚ÄîI‚Äôm able to wear these while mowing the lawn and can hear just fine, even over the noise of the mower. They‚Äôre expensive, but worth it.",5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"I haven't been able to go to an apple store due to the pandemic, one came fully broken and unlistenable in ANC, and the other mode, it's like I listen to myself. I don't know if it's a factory issue but I can't even go to an apple store to have it checked.",1,1,2020-5-20,1,2,0
"As an early adopter of the original Airpods, I was skeptical whether spending $200 on ANOTHER pair would net me any tangible benefits. I went with it and I do not regret it.These things are magical. They fit, they do not fall out, they cancel noise like magic, you can turn off the cancellation for ""pass through mode"" with a squeeze, and the noise cancellation effect doesn't produce that ""head pressure"" sensation (for me, at least) that other noise cancellation devices produce.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0
"After months of itching, crusting, leaking, a trip to urgent care, an ER visit and ultimately an ENT appointment, I figured out my problem is an allergic reaction to the air pod pros.  I am frustrated because as a long time Apple user I never had any issue so it was well after the ability to return them date that it was figured out.I have been reading others having the same issue... if we can‚Äôt return them, those who have suffered should come together for a class action suit.",1,1,2020-8-18,1,2,0
"I've owned the original AirPods since shortly after their release and was always very pleased by them, battery lasted long, the sound quality was above that of EarPods (but not anything exceptional), and just overall felt revolutionary. Picked up these pros when they were on sale and was sadly not finding them very comfortable. The sound quality was that of a good pair of $100~$200 headphones and the noise cancellation was superb, but they just didn't sit comfortably in my ears. Tried all size tips for a few days and I just couldn't get used to them. Ended up selling to a friend and continue to happily use my original AirPods",4,1,2020-8-19,1,0,0
"I wanted to buy a set of bluetooth headphones that sounded similar to the original wired headphones that came with my IPhone XR.  I started at the >$100 range by reading many reviews, after choosing a well known brand I was very surprised on how horrible the sound quality was, I spent close to $100 and the sound quality was like a wired $4.99 pair of headphones, simply atrocious. I returned them and decided to go up to the $150 range. Once again, the sound quality was nothing like the wired headphones that come with the IPhone, I would say that they barely sounded like a $20 pair of regular wired headphones, if that at all. I then was almost convinced that I would never have the same sound with a pair of bluetooth. Before giving up, I added another $100 bucks and got myself the Airpods Pro. I have to say I was blown away to hear the amazing depth and detail in the sound quality. And on top of that, every other aspect of the headphones is incredible: incredibly comfortable (i.e. you forget you have them on), yet they will never fall out of your ears, amazing battery like and the case charges very fast, they sound great on phone calls (both incoming and outgoing audio quality), fantastic noise cancellation (I can mow the lawn and barely hear the lawn mower) and the transparency mode is great too, I can listen to tunes and also hear my wife blabbing away without annoying her...Sure, these are pretty expensive compared to others, but they are by far the best bang for your buck you will get. Your ears are important, spend a little more now and be extremely happy, you deserve it!",5,1,2020-5-5,1,0,0
"Don't buy, Apple support is stupid! The left earbud doesn't connect after 1 and half month, chatted with Amazon to get a replacement for the left side, they chat with Apple. Charge me $98.97 to get a replacement for the left earbud. Funny that I never received the replacement, when I write this review I have spent another 1 hour with a representative from Amazon who is trying to connect me with Apple. I have wasted 5+ hours to sort this out, it's not worth it, so disappointed.",1,1,2020-7-17,1,2,0
"The price made me hesitant about buying these, but I work in a noisy office and my upstairs neighbors have a two year old. I needed some peace. The sound cancellation isn‚Äôt 100%, but it‚Äôs surprising good at providing relief in both situations. In addition, at home, I can listen to music or watch movies without worrying that I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs disturbing others. They‚Äôre an investment, so I have a rule that they‚Äôre either in my ears or safely stored in the case. They‚Äôre not going to mysteriously disappear at work or be eaten by my dog at home.",5,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"I purchased these for my husband's birthday since he refused to spend that much money on headphones. He absolutely loves them! He said in his war game he can now clearly hear the footsteps of someone sneaking around & that the noise cancellation is definitely worth the extra money. He compared his pros to my daughters regular air pods & is glad I bought him the pros. He wears them while he's on the lawn mower & said he can only feel that the lawn mower is on, but he can't hear it! He's also impressed with how quickly they charge & how long they last. Great gift!",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"I bought these to replace my 3rd pair of BeatsX which had a decent sound. These have an ""mkay"" sound. Almost every reviewer said their sound was fantastic or at least really good. It's really not that great. It lacks mediums and trebles are way too muddy, especially for in ears. Noise cancelling is very average as the sound isolation is not really great with these very short ear plugs.One thing they're good at though is convenience. They are just perfect to have around, just put them in and enjoy a video or music on the go. Plus noice cancelling and sound being what it is, it's still pleasant being able to go out and maybe work with some noise cancelling on and a quite decent sound quality.",3,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0

"Item is legit, came with original package. I was a bit worried since amazon sells it at a discounted price compare to Apples website. But it is the original. No problem so far, love the noise canceling part. Really blocks the low ends noise such as street cars, gardening, TV etc. high pitch sound will be reduced, but still could still hear it slightly. Great for studying or just want to have some quietness.  Definitely worth the price. However, I can  only wear it on my right ear long time, but not the left ear. Both fits well, but just one side can wear longtime. Could be my own reason, and my own ear structure. Don‚Äôt get how some people can wear it for whole days.",5,1,2020-7-21,1,0,0
"These headphones are game changing, they have a few issues that are very minor, so I‚Äôll lead with those. If you go into the detail of this review you‚Äôll see I‚Äôve given this 4 stars on the main categories yet 5 stars overall. The reason for this are because there are products out there with better aspects in all of those, but for the size of these, the convenience of these, I‚Äôm quite surprised how much they were able to fit into these. The headphones can hurt a bit after leaving in for a long time if they are put in a little too much ‚Äúrotated‚Äù, but these can be fixed by buying separate cheap tips from online. The noise cancellation and the ease of doing so just by asking Siri to do it, are absolutely SO nice to have. The quality is what you‚Äôd expect with a premium headphone, it‚Äôs not like a pair of over ear Sennheiser‚Äôs, but that‚Äôs expected, these don‚Äôt have the physical space to do that. These are definitely a purchase that you will be very happy with.",5,1,2020-7-11,1,0,0
"Replaced a pair of first generation AirPods and these worked so well - another pair for my wife.  Fit process is wonderfully simple - you end up with a comfortable and useful earbud in no time.  Pairing is about as simple as you can get.  We normally use Bose over the ear noise canceling headphones when traveling - these do the same job and are obviously easier to pack.  The 5 hour battery life is a concern on a long flight, but the recharge time is quick and the charging case does the job perfectly.  Bose headphones are now on a shelf.",5,1,2019-12-3,1,0,0
"As headphones they work great.  I fly usually 8-10 times a year and the noise cancelling is pretty decent.  Overall sound quality is also excellent.  Haven't had any issues with battery life, if it gets low I just pop them in the case for a few minutes and your good to go.  Only complaint I have is using them for phone calls (as others have said) the sound is slightly muffled and people cannot hear you clearly.  Worth the $235 I paid on amazon though.",5,1,2020-5-13,1,1,0
"I had the AirPods for couple of years, and when the AirPods pro came out there were lots of hype about this new model. I was reluctant to spend another $250 for something I thought will just have the same sound quality and performance as the AirPods. Contrary to my believe, this is the best noise canceling earbuds comparing to all the others I had, such as the Bose on ears and in ears,etc. and the sound quality has improved due to the better noise canceling feature. I‚Äôm sold the minute I put these on. I travel quite frequently and these are very comfortable to wear during the long hours trip. Two thumbs up !",5,1,2020-1-20,1,0,1
"My AirPods don't seem to be water or sweat resistant. Some water got on them and they stopped working for a day. Also, they keep slipping off my ear every now and then, and even though the size is completely perfect for my ears, they still slip after a while. The noise cancellation isn't completely perfect because I still hear everything around me, the difference is that they are a little less noisy. Additionally, they keep disconnecting every 15 minutes. I contacted Apple and they told me to reset them but they still disconnect. I feel like they don't deserve that much money to be spent on them. I'm disappointed.",1,1,2020-3-30,1,1,0
"I truly love my AirPods for many reasons, including the noise cancellation and ease of use. But the body of the AirPod pros is just way too big for my ears. The slip and sit comfortably into my ears but then start feeling painful after a short amount of time...to the point where I have to take breaks in between wearing them. I have tried the different ear piece sizes but those don‚Äôt make a difference as I stated that it‚Äôs the AirPod Body itself that‚Äôs too big. It‚Äôs pushing hard against my ears",4,1,2019-12-10,1,1,0
"I use them for conference calls and listening to music, doing chores, turning down the noise when I'm using the blender or coffee grinder or lawn mower or circular saw or when the kids are on a screaming bent. They're fantastic.Only issue is that the volume is really low when paired with ubuntu bt, and even that doesn't bring this below 5 stars they're so fantastic with iphone and apple laptop and apple tv.

"I am sorry to have to write a bad review on these, but they never worked correctly.  We received them and the left pod charged up, but the right one never charged correctly, only to less than 10% battery life, and was hot as an iron all of the time.  I needed to get a replacement ordered, and unfortunately, Amazon send me the wrong item as the replacement instead of new airpods (multiple items on the order I had placed), so that delayed us getting these even longer.  This was just a bad luck order that is unfortunate.",1,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
The Noise Cancellation feature on these airpods are a big step up but their function still has a long way to fight compared to regular headphones with ANC. I like the look on these plus the comfort it provides during longer hours of usage makes it easier to keep in the ear versus slipping out. The sound quality doesn't seem to have improved from previous models so I can't say it's that great. The sound quality is mostly changed from the addition of Noise Cancellation. I'm curious how battery life will hold up on these with constantly using the ANC though for months later  -- i'm already noticing a weaker charge life.,3,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"AirPod Pros almost always get 5 star ratings.  For the price difference between AirPod generation 2, which I owned, and these, I expected a bigger difference in sound quality.  Further, Apple changed the firmware after I bought them and the noise cancelation got worse.  Perhaps they will fix that.I have wired Bose noise canceling ear bugs.  They are better than the AirPod Pros on an airplane.",3,1,2020-2-20,1,1,0
"Older version AirPods didn‚Äôt stay in my ears. We bought 2 of these (one for me, one for wife) and both fit and stay in place.

I love Apple products but these Airpods are far from Pro. Sound is good but not great and delfinitely not worth the asking  price. If you throw on a set of silicone noise reduction earbud tips on Airpods Gen 1 or 2 they will sound like the Pros. The worst part of the Airpod Pros is the battery life. Don't believe the hype!,2,1,2020-1-12,1,1,0
"I used it for two days since received this. The noise cancellation is great, the transparent mode is extremely useful to help you hear others without stopping the music(yeah I know..

"I've had noise cancelling earphones before and i have airpod 2, didn't like these due to the pressure and that you can hear your own footsteps at low volume.  bought these because everyone gave great reviews online. They work fine when listening to music at high volume, pressure seems to go away and does pretty good job at noise cancelling. But, i do a lot of walking and i like to listen to music at relatively low volume, pressure is way too high for comfort and hate the thumping sound i hear in my ear with every step.  i hate to return stuff so gonna give it couple more tries but so far day 2 not good... (tried different size fit)Update: had them for few weeks now. Getting used to them.  They fit well.  Great on planes, trains, etc.  liking the fit of them, still don‚Äôt like the pressure too much.

"I received the the shipment quickly.  I was excited to try these as I have been struggling with trying to find a good set  of wireless earbuds for working out.  I run so I was concerned that they would not stay in place.  If I wear these out or around the house they are great.  However when I wear them on a run they loosen, which impacts sound quality and I am afraid that I will lose one.  I am continuously pressing them back into place.  I have swapped the tips from the smaller to the medium size to try and get a better fit.  I even used the mobile app tool for ensuring that you are using the right tips.Overall I would recommend these for anyone who just wants wireless earbuds for everything but vigorous workouts.",3,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0

The only way I knew that baby was crying was every time that I‚Äôve got to go to the bathroom and I took my headphones off it was still screaming I was so thankful to have the AirPods with the noise cancellation I didn‚Äôt hear a thing. I also own Bose noise canceling headphones but they‚Äôre big and they‚Äôre bulky, mash your hair down and are not comfortable to wear around your neck.My battery life seems to last for quite a long time.

It's OK to sell used products, just label them as such.Reguarding the Airpod pros, I've compared them with similar products from 1More and Cambridge. Both of those are around $100. In terms of ease of use - connecting, dropped signal, phone calls - the Pro wins. In terms of sound quality, the Airpod pro was a close second to 1More, which felt fuller andre comanding than the AirPod pro.",3,1,2020-7-24,1,0,0

I used to wear $40 wired headphones bought off of Amazon that did better in that category. I still like the comfort and the sound up to 75% max volume but they get tinney after that.

Some of the features offered by these airpods are pretty good but these silicone tips are VERY uncomfortable. I cannot get a good fit. They slide out very easily. I can't even turn my head to hard because they'll slip out of my ear. I had the 2nd Generation Pods for almost 2 years & was hoping to upgrade but these are not it.

The sound quality is better than the 3 pairs of Bose headphones I‚Äôve had over the years. The noise canceling is super high. My only complaint with these is that I don‚Äôt love the way it sounds without the noise cancelling enabled so I use it whenever I am using the headphones. They are much more comfortable than the over ears headphones I was using before and I‚Äôve been wearing them for 9 hours a day.

Be mindful that they are not meant for everyone‚Äôs ears and apparently I‚Äôm not the only one with this issue. It would be better if Apple came out with memory foam tips for them.

"Love everything they bring to the table. If you use the right size ear tips they will fit snug. I run on weekends and they never fall out.The audio quality is crazy good. Not audiophile good, but not too shabby. The bass is deep and present. The dynamic audio between the two buds creates an insane depth of illusion where I sometimes truly cannot tell if the music I‚Äôm listening to is from the AirPod Pros or something around me. They can get quite loud, and if you have noise cancellation on you can get really loud without ever going over half volume (it‚Äôs harder to ‚Äúhear‚Äù the volume when ambient environment noises conflict, thus requiring you to turn your volume up louder without noise cancellation)",5,1,2020-1-27,1,0,0

They are a bit pricey, but worth it at $234. Plus, you can add Apple Care for $29 (for two years of coverage).

"It was a decent product -- great noise cancellation and okay sound quality, until the left pod stopped working completely after I used for two days. I am extremely disappointed and looked up online and found this is a common issue.  I tried to reset it hundred times,  but to no avail. The left pod cannot be connected or charged. I am guessing there was some connection issue between it and the case, such that the case cannot detect the pod. I could have returned it and ask for a new item, but I fear that I will get another defective set and waste even more time. So I will most likely return this for a refund and refrain from this product until it becomes more mature. I do hope that Apple can exercise some quality control on such an expensive gadget.",2,1,2019-11-27,1,1,0
"So I might be jaded, but I was a frustrated with my AirPods (non pro) that I had an impulse moment and bought these. My originals were just crapping out, I like using these for all my work conference calls so they get put through the grind now with remote working keeping me out of the office, they hold up, and I‚Äôm surprised at how effective the noise cancelling is. I have over ear noise cancelling  Bose I rely on for air travel, but would actually consider these for in flight as well if the in ear didn‚Äôt get too uncomfortable.",5,1,2020-9-26,1,0,0
"And it is super hard to get Apple support nowadays. I have tried three sizes of the plastic ring, none of them works.I made a stupid decision to upgrade to the Pro version. My pervious airpods never fall off my ear...",1,1,2020-3-30,1,2,0
"Good sound quality, and useful for many situations: School, car rides, etc. The noise cancelation is best when near a consistent noise (ex  humming of a car engine, nearby dishwasher, washer/dryer, etc.). For being the size that they are, they‚Äôre okay for blocking out voices - wouldn‚Äôt recommend these solely for that purpose.I bought mine used, ‚Äúgood condition‚Äù. Came with EVERYTHING you‚Äôd expect: manuals, cable, ear tips,  user guide, and airpods themselves. The box looked rough when I received the Airpods Pro. But honestly if you‚Äôre worried about a scuffed up / dirty (used) box, get a grip; the box doesn‚Äôt impact user experience whatsoever - I still recommend getting them used. When I got them they were in good condition: minimal scratches, no dents or heavy wear/tear. They‚Äôre still holding up very well! Good price and would  recommend getting a used pair!! The user EXPERIENCE is very good so far!",5,1,2020-2-2,1,1,1
You have to experience this for yourself words cannot explain how awesome this tech is the noise cancellation Yes unbelievable I thought I was going deaf but the noise cancellation cancels out all noise oh the noise if you want a good tech this is the product for you remember you pay for what you get and when you get this text is worth every single penny you spend on it trust me you will not be disappointed.,5,1,2020-5-30,1,1,0
So much better than previous air pods. Noise cancelling makes a huge difference. Also can charge with ear tips on now. No more losing AirPods from a bad fit. I use one large Ear tip and one medium for a custom fit. Much better than my power beats and very comfortableAmazing what can be produced in such a small package,4,1,2019-11-19,1,1,0
"I can‚Äôt believe you pay Over $250 for the ear pods and Apple doesn‚Äôt even send a power adapter to charge them! You receive a charger cord, but not the custom plug that is required. I now have to spend an additional $15 and wait 5 days til I can charge my new ear pods! Come on Apple, this is ridiculous!",1,1,2020-3-29,1,3,0
"Noise cancellation excellent. Sound quality good. Battery life shorter than I expected.Absolute worst aspect--they do not remain in my ears. Walking around my house, worst is if I tilt my head down, as when leaning over out the come. I tried all three ear pieces that come with the Airpods. I need reliable, stay in the ear pods, not just look pretty.",1,1,2020-8-30,1,2,0
"For the airpods pro I do enjoy them. They work well with my iphone xs pairing in about 5 seconds. The sound quality is good as well. In my experience the highs seem a little off in pitch with particular music but other wise everything eles is fine. The base is decent but not to punchy.  As for the noise cancellation it is good but not great. I was under the impression and excitement when i got them they would blow me away from what reviews told me here on Amazon. Though various youtubers were mixed and the audiophiles of course said they work fine for what they are and weren't the best.  They fit fine in my ear with medium tips.  After 1 month of lite use as in just a few hours or more a week on average it does a good job. just don't expect to be blown away and its all subjective. It doesn't tune out cars all the way like some people say you can still here them in the background walking next to them or 100 feet away. If you have your volume at 50 perecent it does feel everything is blocked out for the most part but the music is almost to loud for me but again thats preference.  In conclusion if you don't have a spare 250 lying around from Christmas still or tax returns I would just wait to buy them in the future or perhaps wait till a new model comes out.  They work well but wired ones get the job done and noise cancellation isn't required for a good experience, noise cancellation just helps it out.",4,1,2020-2-15,1,0,0
"It was really excited to have new version of the air pod , but this is so disappointed since this air pods pro ain‚Äôt good compare to the first version ... it always disconnected when I locked my iPhone , and it now my phone needs to be always on , super weird ..but the sound of quality definitely improves, better than the air pod first version ... only thing complain about is the poor connection.",2,1,2020-4-1,1,1,0
"When Apple released the AirPods Pro, the clamor was about Active Noise Cancelling features. Let me tell you, while that mode is great, the transparency mode is the killer feature.  In transparent mode, you can have the AirPods in and hear your music while STILL hearing the surrounding sounds - no its not just muffling through - the technology actually amplifies the outside sounds and blends them perfectly with the music/audio you have playing - think of it as having a radio on in the background while you are listening to a lecture.  Excellent quality - as always for Apple - great battery life and charging case.  Try out the transparency mode - its an amazing feature.",5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"I got the Jabra Elite 75t before thee after some professional reviews. I now think they where paid for their reviews. The apple air pods are far superior in sound quality, call quality, and fit. The transparency mode is almost like not having the earpods in.  Elite 75t sounded like you where listening to amplification through an old radio, and were horrible in the wind. The passive noise reduction is about the same.  And the active noise reduction which Jabra doesn't have is amazing.  Tested it with the microwave vent first. For 3 out of the 4 settings, I could barely tell it was running.  Interestingly eneough it was on setting 3 that I could hear it (must be a frequency thing). Today I tried them on the lawn tractor.  You could definately hear it, but could also hear my podcast at 50% instead of 80-100%. The fit is good and they don't fall out. The only thing that the pro reviewers got right was that the case on the Elite 75t does have a nicer feel/ finish (also like the square bottom). Really the only regret however; is that they only come in white. If you have an Apple phone I would definately reccommend these.",5,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"I was very excited to get these and they worked perfectly for the first few weeks. Then the left one stopped charging all the time. It would say they were both charging when I put them in the case and walked away but in the morning, one is 100% the other is still at 10%. So I have to sit there and manually fiddle with it until I can get it to charge (and yes, I confirmed the case was clean like apple said to). Annoying, but could deal with.The real issue is a few weeks after that, they started having issues connecting to iPhone 11 and MacBook pro on Catalina. Would factory reset: nothing. Reset again: nothing. Often took 3-5 resets to get them to start pairing until they finally worked. Since this multi-reset process would take up to 15 minutes, this made them unusable some of the time.",1,1,2020-6-8,1,0,0
"Pretty convinced that the airpods are used and they sold me as new. Because the device name is ""Chen's airpods pro"", which I haven't figured out how to change it and nobody in my family's name is Chen.

The battery only lasts for a few hours.",1,1,2020-6-9,1,2,0
"Everyone I talk to with these can't tell the difference compared to just my phone, the noise cancelling tec is way better than I expected but with it off I can hear ambient noise at a slightly quieter sound level than what I'm listening to, 5 hours on 1 charge is about right- I only use one ear piece at a time so I don't have to stop listening to music throughout the day, I thought I was gonna rip the rubber part when I changed it but it did pop straight off when I pulled hard, I even got a bluetooth adapter for my pc and I use these for gaming too(had to go with a PCIE card), *note the button on the back of the case for syncing is a actual button, I use these with a galaxy s8 plus - for voice assistant I had to go with google (have not used it enough to say much) and I use assistant trigger to see battery life",5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
These sound great for listening to music and the noise cancellation is pretty good for earbuds. But the main reason I bought these was for making phone calls. For making calls these things are TERRIBLE!When on a call the person on the other end will always complain that they cannot hear you clearly and that you sound distant. This is a common issue and is well documented on the Apple support pages.,2,1,2020-1-22,1,0,0
I use these for running. They are very comfortable and never fall out. So far they have been sweat proof and I sweat a lot in long runs. My friend and I often share music which is a great little feature. I also love the Siri read text feature so I dont have to pull out my phone while I run.The battery is perfect length. Four hours for the buds and I can get two full charges out of the case.,5,1,2020-6-6,1,0,0
"I've been using these for a few months and travel quite a bit.  I love everything about the headphones, except for the slightly loose fit and the sound quality.  They sound pretty good when they're pressed hard and deep into my ear, but inevitably they start falling out and the sound quality goes down and they'll even fall out if I don't keep pressing them in.  I tried two sizes, but can't find a good option.Love the rapid connection, using one headphone for calls, and the noise cancelling.",4,1,2020-2-16,1,0,0

"Works better than expected, but regardless still hard to justify $250. Definitely could get better sound from competitors at even half the price, but having multiple iOS devices makes this item worth seriously considering.

"When Airpods first came out, I had no interest in getting them. It was cool that the gen 1 series was wireless but I was happy enough with my 10 pairs of Apple headphones over the years - they were functional. I got these for my dad for Xmas and he loved them. I tried them out myself and was amazed by the noise cancellation feature that I ended up buying a pair for myself. I really use them for connecting to my laptop for video calls or listening to Spotify at work. My second high use for them is at the gym which has been amazing! Using the noise cancellation feature at the gym, tunes out all of the buzzing noises from the fans, to the weight drops, and to hearing the thuds on the treadmill. I can solely focus in on my jams or whatever show/podcast I might have playing. As far as comfort, I did have to switch to the smaller head pieces so they could fit better. I don't worry about losing them, as long as I always put them back in the case and I'm not sure how great battery life is compared to the non-pro airpods, but I do enjoy these.",4,1,2020-2-26,1,0,0
"I've had this AirPods Pro for a while now. It is a great product. But I will say that because of the recent update apple has RUINED the noise cancellation. It does not block low frequency sound like is used to be since the recent update and apple needs to fix this. The sound quality is acceptable, slightly more bass than the regular AirPods but don't expect audiophile quality. Battery life is as expected, with about 4.5 hours with ANC on. This is a good product, but until apple fixes the ANC I will hold back my recommendation.",3,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0

No matter which size ear piece I tried, even buying highly-rated after market memory foam ear pieces, the things just didn't want to stay in. And when I tried keeping them in with, my ears end up hurting.They wanted to slip out just sitting on the couch, laying down, talking or eating.

"If you plan to use these just for runs, walking, studying, and low impact-- they are perfect! I have no complaints except for the fact that when I did my HIIT (burpees, jump rope) they slipped out of my ear. I would push them into my ear and then my inner ear would start to hurt (NOT good). For my short distance runs they were fine, but if I did longer distance and sweat ALOT, the sweat would impact how they stayed in my ear. I returned them and plan to get the wireless beats.Again, if you do not plan to use them for very high intensity stuff, they are very worth it!

An expensive earbud like this and Apple can not include an adapter to charge the Charger in an ordinary wall outlet?  They could have just increase the cost by $3.00.  Almost all wall outlet with USB have a regular USB connector.  This killed the excitement and we have to scramble to buy an adapter before we can used it.

"Like the simplicity of the AirPods. But I think Apple has either lots it‚Äôs touch on design or became too cocky to recognize that this design takes sometime to get used to. Switching from gen1, miss my tap, and the stems are too short to interact with, and case is too cumbersome to take out of the pods from the case especially, if you have fat fingers.Ear  Fit is mediocre at best and still could not get over with the fear that they might fall out of my ear and I will loose them in the cracks, while on the sidewalks.Now the bad things out of my chest, these are the best functioning airpods with great integration into Apple devices.

"I bought the air pods pro thinking that they would stay in my ears and function properly while I'd go on runs.  This is unfortunately not the case.  Despite experimenting with the different fittings provided, they consistently fall out of my ears during pretty much any type of workout.  Even just doing a set of push ups they'll find a way to pop out.  On top of this, sometimes on ear will fail to connect, or they'll just cut out and send a loud ringing noise that is very unpleasant.  You have to pop them back in the case and try to reconnect to resolve.  Take away:  If your looking for a pair of headphones to workout with, these simply DO NOT get it done, don't let a high price point fool you.",2,1,2020-9-13,1,1,0
These are spectacular and when accompanied with foam earplug replacements fit my ears perfectly. I found the factory rubber earplugs fell out when I worked out. Far superior to the standard apple earbuds but the sound is not superb if you were hoping to use them for watching late night movies and not wake up the family. The sound Imaging feels like it comes from behind your head just above the shoulder line. I have tried quite a few headphones from low end to the high end units and feel like these are in the middle. I‚Äôm a bit of an audiophile and love listening to my Sound system but I was hoping to avoid the inevitable turn that down by using my new headphones. These are not even close to a decent sound system and watching movies on them is just...ok. The convenience factor makes for a great tool for talking on the phone and being mobile which is why I gave it high review stars. Let‚Äôs face it for the price you can hardly get a decent set of  interconnects so I can‚Äôt really complain.

"just get the product straight from apple store that makes any issues with the product resolve faster. Do get apple care too, it's cheaper cost when you get it fixed.

First few months, I had no issue with it but I had some accidental drops or carpets or mattress at the gym (maybe this is why mine is so jacked up and has problem) but with the price this high?! minor damage shouldn't affect the product where I had to reset mine and connect to my devices again holy crap. Still, noise cancelation is great you won't really hear constant noise , but you will hear loud music coming from outside or any inconsistent noise that are really hard to cancel out. sometimes it noise cancel even if Im on the freaking transparency mode this happens a lot when I just have one AirPod in my ear.

"I went from the regular Airpods to the Pros, and overall I really like them. As a student, these come in handy a lot when I'm in a public space and need to focus to study/read as the noise cancelation on these is pretty good to where people talking in the background is muffled enough and is then just white noise, even without any music playing. This was not the case when I had the regular Airpods. I really like the noise cancelation, but must admit it's my first time with this feature in a pair of headphones, as I've only really used Apple headphones for the last 5-8 years at this point. The sound quality is good, better than the regular ones, and overall I like their look and they don't feel uncomfortable in my ears. My biggest thing when comparing them to the regular Airpods however is that I can't talk or eat in them because after a little while the right headphone seems to ever so slowly slide out. This is not really an issue as I can just take out the right headphone while doing these things, but it was never an issue with the regular Airpods, and it is a bit of a ""sacrifice"". It's not a deal breaker and overall I really enjoy the experience of using them, but it's just something to consider (especially for the price tag). If you don't care too much for noise cancellation, and just want easy to use wireless headphones for your iPhone, I think you should save the money and get you some regular Airpods.",4,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0

The original AirPods were always ok to me, but these take it to a whole other level. When putting them in I almost forget that they are in my ear. Very comfortable and will not fall out. Sound quality is way better compared to the originals. Way more base and sound much better. Noise cancelation and transparency mode make such a big difference. Noise cancelation work amazing. Almost as good as the noise cancellation on the beats studio 3‚Äôs. And transparency mode is super convenient. Battery life is amazing. Only been charging them every 2-3 days. And it‚Äôs so nice to just drop them onto a wireless charger. Overall such an amazing upgrade. Highly highly recommend these if you like AirPods or looking into buying some AirPods. AirPods Pro is the way to go.",5,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
"Those are amazing...  noise canceling is the strangest noise and the mode where you can hear everything... thats scary good. Definitely worth it, has wireless and wired charging. My only complaint was using them when changing elevations quickly the pressure doesn‚Äôt feel that good.",5,1,2020-9-14,1,1,0
"If you are a student or person who wants to use the airpods with a Chromebook, DON'T! When I paired them and started to listen to music, the right airpods was delayed by like a half a second. Then the music cuts out then comes back up. They even made popping noises once, to solve the problem put them back in the case for 5 mins. But I pair them with my I phone and I pad and they worked, amazingly! No delay! And no cutting out! SO DON'T LISTEN TO THEM ON THE CHROME BOOK! WORKS WITH APPLE THE BEST! But, if you take them up 10,000 ft in the air if you are traveling in a plane. They make this weird sound if you push hard on them. Other than that they worked!",4,1,2019-11-29,1,1,0
"Bought these for my wife and the experience was so good, heck, she bought me a pair.With noise cancellation on, my lips are moving and she can‚Äôt hear a word with me standing right next to her. Amazing.",5,1,2020-7-4,1,0,0

"I love the first model of AirPods and the pros are definitely a step up. The wireless charging is great for me as I like the flexibility of charging both ways. I think the noise cancelation feature could be bumped up a little more as I can still catch the noise of someone else in the room. I reach for over ear headphones if I'm working and can still hear my partner. My biggest issue is I lost my first pair and only noticed after the battery was dead that they were gone, could no longer track them on find my iphone. I now have a case and clip on this second pair and keep them clipped to my car keys. Fingers crossed I someday find the first pair!",5,1,2020-8-5,1,1,0
These are way overrated. I went back to the 2 generation. The noice cancellation does not work and they offer nothing that the second generation does not offer. At least with the second generation they offer a clean sleek look and feel.,1,1,2020-4-5,1,2,0
I‚Äôm not kidding when I say this. I was walking to my morning class and we have train tracks next too our housing so typical me had my airpods in and walked out to like a normal day. So I was halfway in between the rails when I looked to my right and there was a train less than 10 yards from me going full speed that I had not even heard until it blared its horn AFTER I saw it. I almost shit my pants and pissed myself and I have never backed up out of the way faster in my entire life. To make a long story short the noise cancellation on these headphones is so great I almost got hit by a train. I would highly recommend these headphones unless you work in the railroad industry. 10/10,5,1,2020-3-5,1,1,0
"I tried numerous headsets and keep coming back to these. Plain and simple they are the best headset for you iPhone.So, if you are tired of trying to save money and convincing yourself the cheaper ones will do the same thing and sound just as good",5,1,2020-6-23,1,1,0
I was skeptical to spend the money after I had wasted money on the other style of AirPods. Totally worth the money!!! They are comfortable AND stay in my ears. I used them while mowing the lawn and I couldn‚Äôt believe how much noise cancellation they provided. The previous style hurt my ears so bad and would constantly fall out because the earpiece was too big.,5,1,2020-8-28,1,2,0
I had a set of AirPods and I really liked the sound and the fact that everything is integrated with the apple stuff.  But they had a tendency to hurt my ear after awhile.  I thought I would try the AirPods Pro as I thought the cushions that go into your ear would help and they sure do.  The sound quality is excellent and I love the noice canceling feature.I got a warehouse deal and I've been perfectly happy with them and would definitely recommend them.,5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
"Never had a problem ordering from Amazon like this. Received disgusting, used airpods pro. Still had earwax on them from the last person. What is going on. Serial number on charging case doesn't match the number on the box either.",1,1,2020-4-27,1,2,0
"I first want to say that I love these headphones. For the current price point, I feel that they are a great value. I love the noise-cancelling. It's definitely noticeable. I was amazed at the difference. It literally feels like it silences the world around you.It was so good that I had to turn the noise cancelling off in order to hear my TV in my house.I want to say that the only reason that I didn't give this 5 stars is because I don't like the fact that u cant adjust the volume on the airpods themselves, you have to do it on your phone.",4,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
"My biggest issues...1) Needs more passive noise canceling, another words it needs to go in the ear further. Its hard to get a good fit, and I feel like I constantly have to keep trying to shove it in further.",4,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"I had the Bose Bluetooth ear buds and they were pretty big and bulky. Being so big, they had a tendency to fall out during running on a treadmill. I elected to buy these in hopes that they would stay out during my running on the treadmill. I am a bit of a sweater so ear buds have a tendency to always not want to stay in. These do not sounds quite as good as the Bose did but that was to be expected. The noise cancellation is pretty good. The battery case is way smaller than the Bose and I like that. Back to the fit, one of my Air Pod Pros does not like to stay in. I do have to constantly push it back in and refit it. That is a pain. This is probably just my ear though. Connection to any Apple device is a breeze. Like all Apple products, they just work. Would I recommend them? That is tough. I like them enough that I bought some for my wife for Christmas. I would have to say that I do recommend them and caveat that by saying I am hoping for some sort of ear clip that some aftermarket manufacturer will offer for these to ensure they stay in on my cardio workouts.",4,1,2019-12-12,1,0,0
Everything is very good except the in ear fit which slips out of your ears after about two minutes. The sound quality is also OK with the volume being not as high as you would like and the bass not as present as previous AirPod models.,4,1,2019-11-11,1,3,0
"After my last gen AirPods started to slowly waste away and die I decided on going for these AirPods pros. Love the way they look and the force pinching mechanism was a neat replacement for the touch sensitivity of the last iteration.  However, after having these for a few days I have finally accepted that these are just painful.  After about 30 mins of having these in my ears, they cause discomfort and soreness on the upper portion of my ear canal.  I am going to wait it out and see if my ears will adjust to the discomfort otherwise they will be going back.  Also it seems that only one of the AirPods seems to want to stay in my ear as the left one continually pushes itself out of my ear every 30-60 seconds and results in the noise cancellation to stop working.  As you can imagine this is maddeningly (!) annoying so I have decided to purchase some foam tips to see if they will help alleviate this huge issue. I loved the last generation of AirPods and wore them until the cows came home, these however, I do not know if I can stand them. The noise isolation is great, they sound good, but jeez for $200+ I was expecting a better feeling product.  I wish that I these were like the last generation where I barely noticed they were in my ear, but alas we can dream.",3,1,2020-5-14,1,0,0
"I‚Äôve had to reset these a few times. Sometimes it‚Äôs hissing, sometimes it‚Äôs one side won‚Äôt start playing, sometimes it‚Äôs answering a call and the microphone refuses to start.When I first purchased the, they would pass the ‚ÄúFit Test‚Äù in the settings with both the medium and large silicone ear tips. After two weeks, nothing gets them to pass the test for either size. They still seem to work fine usually, but it‚Äôs a concern.",4,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"I rarely endorse products, but this is virtual perfection. The noise cancellation is so good, I find myself wearing the AirPods without any music playing, just to silence my environment. Also, the charging case is the PERFECT size. Being able to fit in your coin pocket sore shows how well thought out the design is. They only flaw I see is that they don‚Äôt always stay in the ear. They should‚Äôve at a hook or tab built in to keep them from falling out while moving around.",5,1,2020-2-26,1,1,0
Honestly they do a great job for noise cancellation but it‚Äôs ability to produce hard bass is kind of disappointing. The beats X have better bass. And I guess it‚Äôs just me but it‚Äôs really uncomfortable in my ear. The right ear gets so tired that it leaves it numb and hurting for hours before I can use them again. Great sound quality and battery life is really good but it‚Äôs just really uncomfortable around the antibelicista of the ear for me. It hurts after an hour or two is use.,3,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0
"The quality and integration are what you would expect from Apple. However, I was expecting to be blown-away with the sound quality which I wasn't. No doubt it's very good. But I did side-by-side comparisons with my $35 Boltune BLE earbuds that I bought last year, and they sound almost identical.I'm also disappointed that I can't change the volume with the AirPods Pro... Seriously? You have to change the volume on your source or by asking siri to change the volume. All you can do is skip tracks, pause, play, and change between noise cancelation mode and transparency mode by squeezing the stem of the AirPods Pro.  I was also disappointed that they don't respond to taps on the side like the original AirPods. Super cheap bluetooth earbuds can both change volume and respond to taps.",4,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"Was a big fan of the 1st gen airpods..used them everyday. The Pro's are a great addition. Noise cancelling and transparency modes are quite good, they are more comfortable and also looks better in my opinion. Are they the best sounding wireless buds? No, but its practicality its beyond this world. Especially if you surround yourself in the apple ecosystem.  I used the 1st gen airpods everyday for 2 years with no issues and loving every minute, I'm expecting the same and more out of this. Definitely worth a buy, you can take these bad boys literally everywhere.",5,1,2020-9-10,1,0,0
"2 months after I started using them, the right AirPod started making a weird beeping noise whenever the noise cancellation was turned on. the beeping was sensitive to any movement like moving my head a bit or walking.As this is a new feature for airpods, I am not surprised it has some flaws.",3,1,2020-6-12,1,1,0
So disappointed in these new Airpod Pros.  What a waste of money.  I should have just stuck with my old original Airpods.  Noise Cancellation does not work at all.  Can't get any of the ear attachments to fit correctly for my left ear.  I don't notice any improved quality of sound compared to my old Airpods.Totally not work buying the Pros.  Stick with the basic Airpods because the features such as noise cancellation that they tout with the Pros are worthless.,1,1,2020-1-30,1,1,0
"I never thought I would buy into the air pod craze when they originally became popular but after quite a bit of research and a recent change in working remotely from home, I decided on the the air pod pro model. They comfortable once your ears get use to them and the sound quality is unparalleled.I ended up purchasing an additional pair for my Mom for Mother‚Äôs Day.

"so i own the sony wf-1000xm3 and sp800n noise cancellation earphones, and these are in the middle of them. the noise cancellation isnt as good as the mx3s, but better than the sp800. same with sound quality, and these have worse battery life than the others. I use android and these dont have any problem working with it or my windows computer. i just needed to download a battery life indicator app and i didnt need to change what the touch sensors do, so it works out for me. but i still find myself using these more than the others for a few reasons. the comfort is better than the other 2, and they weigh less. i have weird ears, so i still need ear hooks with these which work very well. the sp800 also have ear hooks, but they go in slightly less comfortable. with the price of all 3 being close if not at 200, i would chose these if im just looking for some anc earbuds that anyone would be happy with. the wf-1000mx3 are better, but less comfortable.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
I had been using it AirPod from first generation so when I see that new AirPod relieve I was so excited for it but I have to give comment on it.The sound quality is very good but compare to air pod I will say it is not a huge improvement.,3,1,2020-4-20,1,1,0
"Sound quality is pretty good! Noice cancellation is good, but not amazing. These are definitely better sound quality than the Beats Pro‚Äôs and their connection to the iPhone is much better. I honestly was surprised that they didn‚Äôt stay in my ears as well as I was expecting, especially when I exercise. And sometime, even when I‚Äôm not exercising, they will just fall out of my ears. Nonetheless, I do like these, but I would recommend getting plastic hooks (on Amazon) that can really help them stay on while running/ exercising.",4,1,2020-3-22,1,0,0
"What I love is how easy they are to use, and that  they immediately connect to the phone. I also love the noise cancellation feature!! I  wish there was a way to raise or lower the volume without touching the phone, it‚Äôs not a huge deal as the phone is often nearby but it would be convenient if they had the option. The battery doesn‚Äôt seem to hold all that long but all I do is place them back in the little container and they will recharge rather quickly..I just simply plug the whole thing in at night and the container easily holds the charge the next day. But I‚Äôve been on flights and noticed the buds themselves needed recharging after watching a long movie Or a couple of hours .",4,1,2020-7-9,1,0,0
"the right airpod boasted a clicking, static-noise that sounded like there was constant wind blowing on it. i spent over an hour on the phone with apple as they patiently tried to help me troubleshoot the issue. in the end, nothing could fix it. i ended up returning this pair and ordering directly from apple itself and while it was more expensive and took longer to receive, was way more worth it in the end.i recommend purchasing directly from apple and passing along these.",1,1,2020-5-26,1,0,0
"These earbuds are fantastic. The noise cancelling is top notch, and the sound quality (while noise cancelling is on) is pretty good. However, because the earbuds are only held in by the actual buds themselves with no wing or anything else to support them, they can fall out while running or working out, but that's really the only time that becomes a problem.In terms of comfort, you get to choose between three sets of rubber tips, and if those don't fit you'll probably have to buy aftermarket stuff, but I doubt that would be too common of a problem. They stay in my ears while I'm not doing anything too active, and they only start to be a little uncomfortable after the first few hours wearing them.",4,1,2020-9-16,1,0,0
"Pro: Comfortable, sound quality, noise cancellation is good yet not at the level of an over ear headphone ie BoseCon: I use my Airpods almost all day long.  The previous generation would last me a full day without needing a charge. So far the Pro's on average need to be charged at least twice a day.  By my estimate the battery life is roughly 1/3 of the previous model.",3,1,2020-8-6,1,0,0
"I bought these primarily for working out and they are perfect at cancelling out the noise of the treadmill. They also manage to stay in my ear even when I‚Äôm running. I‚Äôve used them in the car and they also manage to cancel out a surprising amount of the road noise, though I‚Äôm not sure how they would do on an airplane. I was also fairly surprised at the noise quality. IMO, they are a step up from pro beats, but a step down from typical over-the-ear headphones like my Sony‚Äôs that I own (nothing can beat those Sony‚Äôs). But for being a noise cancelling earbud, these do a phenomenal job.",5,1,2020-1-12,1,1,0

"It's a good investment if you're trying to cancel out your surrounding noise while studying. Although it doesn't completely mute the noise around you, it does lower the noise. I have small ears so they are a little uncomfortable to wear for more than 2 hours because the ""wing-like design"" kept on pressing my outer ear. The other thing is, the sound is not smooth. It kept on cutting up. I called Apple and apparently the version I had was not updated so they did update the version over the phone. The sound is still cutting up and doesn't sound smooth, but maybe that's just my Airpod Pros. Overall, it depends on what you need it for. I bought the pros for studying purposes and I think they're worth it, but get APPLE CARE just in case.",4,1,2020-5-21,1,1,0
"I was initially very skeptical about getting Airpod Pros because they're pretty pricey. I didn't even get the previous model either due to the price.

If you have an Amazon card I recommend doing the payment plan because it comes down to something like $40 a month, which is much more doable.

"I really like how these are really simple to use and they sound alright, not very bassy but very clear audio. Reason I put down 4 stars is because the silicone ear tips Personally for me kept falling out ( yes I tried all the sizes ), and also if you have them in your ears for a long period of time the silicone start to hurt pretty bad. But it was a easy fix with the memory foam ear tips but a bit ridiculous that you already spent 250$ and have to spend another 20-30$ depending on the tips you get.",4,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0
"These are nice, at first. They slowly creep out of my ears, and lose ANC once they creep enough. They also don‚Äôt function very well with my work PC. I know, I know, Apple products and PC, I must be nuts. While each bud has a mic, they don‚Äôt do well using the left for a while, then transferring to the right so the left can charge, and swapping back again (on PC).

"I bought these airpods pro as an upgrade to my gen 1 airpods, mainly to take advantage of the noise canceling feature for air travel.  I previously used a Bose QC35 headset but wanted something less bulky and without a headband.  Some things to be aware of: The airpods do not do as good a job of noise canceling the airplane drone vs the Bose, mostly because they don't surround your ear.  The batteries on the airpods will run out before a coast to coast flight completes.  Because they are bluetooth you will need a transmitter to send the signal from the plane's entertainment system.  All of these points can be addressed or expected, but if you are replacing a wired Bose headset they should be anticipated.  I will continue to use them going forward as I like the small carrying size, but now plan to recharge them  in the case whenever I get up to use the facilities on the plane to give the batteries a little bump.",4,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0

Presto, the sound seemed to expand and was competitive with my other ear buds.

The rubber tips make these feel more secure than the original design - and I‚Äôm glad they include multiple sizes of tips to choose from. Good investment in my sanity!",5,1,2020-5-10,1,0,0
"AirPods Pro nail all of the essentials, and the noise cancellation and transparency modes both work really well. Since I‚Äôve been using noise cancelling mainly, I‚Äôve noticed only using these at about 60% volume since you don‚Äôt have to compensate for the outside noise. My hearing will probably thank me for that looking forward. These get plenty loud though if you‚Äôre really looking to blow your drums out. Coming from AirPods 1, they're a huge step up, and anyone considering the AirPods 2 should take a look at these. For not that much more on an already rather expensive piece of tech, these offer far more value.(Side note: learn how to update them if you get them, it‚Äôs very easy. the newest firmware d15 is better than the one that comes with them out of the box)",5,1,2020-6-11,1,0,0
"I have tried all of the sizes of nubbins they send and they will not stay in my ears for more than a few seconds. Not even sitting perfectly still at my desk trying to have a conversation on the phone. When I push them back in they hang up on people. These are trash. Expensive, overrated trash. We miss you Steve Jobs.",1,1,2020-8-24,1,2,0
"They‚Äôre okay for the first week. After that you encounter so many issues, like static noises whenever you try to adjust your airpods in your ears bc the external microphones seem to be really sensitive or something idk, after that either one or both will start making a crackling sound and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it, save yourself, they‚Äôre awful, just because they‚Äôre Apple doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre good. I‚Äôm actually going back to the second generation ones, they were so much better, I would‚Äôve never gotten the pros if dumbxss wouldn‚Äôt dropped my gen 2 in the toilet as it was flushing. Not worth it, buy better headphones",1,1,2020-5-5,1,1,0
"These were terrible and I returned them back to Amazon. Tried every ear piece and none kept them from falling out, even while standing still. Forget about running with these. Always dropping phone calls when I tried to adjust the piece in my ear. Don‚Äôt get these.",1,1,2020-3-30,1,2,0
"I like these because they do not hurt my ear like the other AirPods did. However, these AirPods do not fit as securely as the others. I already lost the right AirPod when I was wearing it and wasn‚Äôt even aware, something that never happened with the old AirPods unless something brushed up against them to dislodge them.I am still playing around with the ear tips to find which one is best and will keep them because they do not irritate my ears.",4,1,2020-1-16,1,1,0
"My original order of AirPods are returned due to some defect as the switching noise cancelling and transparent wasn‚Äôt working. I got my replacement, and it‚Äôs working amazingly. I can‚Äôt express how much that improved my work from home meeting, as well as the music experience. I also jog everyday with it on, the size is perfect fit, no sign of slipping at all. Especially with the spatial audio that just got turned on with IOS14, which brought me to write the review. It worth every penny I spend.",5,1,2020-9-24,1,1,0

"After a couple of months of owning these one of the AirPods started making a weird clicking sound. Apple sent a replacement and the issue was fixed.

If you want to have something that just works perfectly with your Apple ecosystem and don‚Äôt like the constant noise you might hear from your AC or fan in your room them this will alleviate the problem for you. These would be great on a plane but at the time of this review I‚Äôm not flying anywhere anytime soon. Sound quality is good considering they are still in ear headphones. The pairing to your phone is literally just unlocking your phone and opening the AirPods case.The headphones are not perfect the few cons I would list are due to the noise cancellation the battery life is only about 4hrs at mid level volume. They don‚Äôt have a way for you to control volume on the headphones other than talking to Siri who‚Äôs still pretty dumb.,4,1,2020-5-15,1,0,0
Yes!!! Holy crap these are awesome. They sound incredible for tiny ear buds. I‚Äôd go almost as far to say they sound as good as some of my studio over ear headphones. Yes I‚Äôm a headphone snob lol. The noise canceling is amazing too you won‚Äôt regret it!,5,1,2020-9-19,1,1,0

"The best in the market. There may be variations for ear sizes n shapes (obvious given our human uniqueness) They the have option to adjust.

I also had construction workers across the street near me. I CANT HEAR THEM. noise cancellation is insane! I wish the battery life was longer but I use them so much it makes sense - good thing they charge super fast‚Äî  Apple is the boss.

"My son purchased these AirPods after saving up for some time. He was really excited to test them out and has not taken them out since receiving them! That says a lot.... The sound quality is awesome! So awesome, he felt it necessary for me to try them so that I could hear the sound quality for myself!  Although Apple products are expensive, the quality is superb! Now if we could only get Apple to stop forcing us to upgrade phone-wise would they be the greatest!üòâ",5,1,2020-8-7,1,1,0
"Don't get these if you're planning to use them as a replacement for traditional headsets for video conferencing. I have a dual monitor setup, a high-speed docking station and all I hear is static and crackling over everyone's voice.

"I love these AirPods and I haven‚Äôt had any since the first generation. These are by far the best AirPods yet and the noise cancelling is insane. Came in two days at a really good price. Only complaint (why I‚Äôm giving it a 4 star) is because when I opened the package the Medium sizes ear tips were missing. Nowhere to be found and the AirPods were ‚Äúnaked‚Äù with no tips. Thankfully I can use the S/L ones that came in the box. Just wish everything came by default like it does in the store. Great purchase! (In the picture the Large tips are installed , Mediums missing)",4,1,2020-2-18,1,0,1
These are perfect personally I think they are better than the past generations The noise cancellation & transparency mode are really a thing of beauty. For the people that are saying they recieved the product used that is outrageous and truthfully i was extremely skeptical about that which is why i still went ahead and purchased. They came with the plastic on brand NEW!! Glad I purchased they are awesome would definitely recommend!!!,5,1,2020-7-31,1,0,0
I looked at many many many wireless buds for about a year and ended up getting some raycons and was initially very pleased. A couple months later I was having issues with the buds stayed synced and even more problems trying to get them synced back together.I decided to bite the bullet and get the AirPods Pro and should have done so as soon as they came out. Immediately the noise canceling was noticeable great for use in a busy office and the transparency feature works well for when you need to notice someone that walks into your office. The additional tips are great for figuring out which fits best for you.,5,1,2020-3-20,1,0,0
"Now that I'm working from home during quarantine, I've become sick of being tethered to my laptop with a CORDED headset.  I wanted something different and the hard ear buds hurt my ears after some time.  These allow a more comfortable use without a cord.  I can walk all around my house and listen/speak during a call without having to take my laptop with me.  It even allows me to get more steps in while still being able to continue working (BONUS)!",5,1,2020-7-5,1,0,0
They don‚Äôt sit in my ears very well even trying the different size buds.  Hopefully I can find some aftermarket ones soon.I do like the noise canceling especially at work where we are all sitting in half cubes.,5,1,2020-2-17,1,1,0
Alright. I have had these for a littler over a month. When I first got them they were great sound quality was good fit was good everything seemed great. One month later I can‚Äôt get a single pair of ear tips to pass the tip fit test. The right air pod makes a weird clicking sound for no reason. Transparency mode is muffled in the right ear and a lot of the time the air pods don‚Äôt charge unless I take it out of the case and put it back. Maybe these problems are only with mine maybe these 1st gen pros have faults? I don‚Äôt know. This is only my experience over the last month and couple days. I still highly recommend these the noise cancelling although not amazing works great and transparency mode is absolutely amazing.,4,1,2020-1-19,1,0,0
I brought these off amazon because target was out of stock. These are not like the last air pod pros I purchased. It does not have good quality sound cancellation and these air pods have ALOT of static noise. They disconnect from the phone often and has to be reconnected/pair back to my iPhone 11 pro max. Wish I would have waited until target came back in stock for the real air pod pros. I guess I brought a defective pair off of amazon. waste of money.,1,1,2020-7-21,1,1,0
This was my first pair of wireless airpods from Apple. The whole process of setting up was quick and easy. The first moment I put them in my ears it felt being transported instantaneously to a different environment. The noise canceling feature is very good. The transparency mode is perfect as you wont have to take the buds off during quick face to face conversations. The sound is rich and full kinda reminiscent of the old Apple wired earbuds that had silicone ear tips. During workouts the earbuds stay comfortably within my small ears using the the medium sized tipsThe utopian experience was short lived tho. I had an issue of the sound crackling in my right ear bud. I tried everything like a factory reset and re-pairing the airpods to no avail. I think there might be a problem with the noise canceling feature. It's still under warranty so I'll call Apple for a replacement but ...I JUST GOT THIS!!!! I would cautiously recommend these earbuds...When it works,3,1,2020-4-26,1,0,0
"I am an Apple guy through and through but I am totally disappointed in the new Airpods Pro. First, taking them out and putting them back in is twice as cumbersome as the first generation. The sound quality is nowhere near its predecessor. While not expecting anywhere near the noise cancellation quality of over the ear sets, the difference in ""transparent mode"" and noise cancellation is virtually non-existent. Finally, fit...I tried all three different earpieces and never felt comfortable with any of them. Sending them back for a refund...",2,1,2019-12-4,1,0,0
"I‚Äôve had the first gen AirPods When they first came out and they were the best thing ever at the time.  I was skeptical about purchasing $250 headphones for mini versions that looked like a knock off of AirPods but in actuality it‚Äôs a solid buy.  Battery lasts much longer, quality is a difference (not super heavy on bass which is a bummer) and light too great for working out, lifting and running.  Taking calls for work or personal is always great with the noise cancellation feature.  Does take a bit to get used to the ‚Äòtight‚Äô feeling of the fit itself but it becomes like second nature when you wear it so often.A huuuuuge step up from the 1st gen by far.",5,1,2020-2-20,1,0,0
The way Apple made them the completely suck. Hurts in my ears no matter what fitting I have. When on the phone and try to put them on it hangs up if don‚Äôt be careful. Definitely not worth the money whatsoever. I‚Äôll stick with my first generation AirPods.,1,1,2020-6-30,1,1,0
now i really don't like apple products 99% of the time for being super over priced and usually worse than most things out there but these are the best truly wireless earbuds ive ever had the noise cancelling pleasure of owning. definitely worth the price tag. putting these in for the first time and witnessing all the ambient noise quickly fade away a few seconds later was an experience. the sound quality when listening to music or other media is as good if not better than anything else out there not specifically designed for audiophiles. the battery life is a bit short compaired to other headphones but can still reach five and a half hours easily with even more available when recharged from the case so most of the time i only need to charge them once every few days.,5,1,2019-11-13,1,0,0
"I've tried different kinds of noise-canceling earbuds, headphones, and earphones. (Bose QC20, 25, 30, 35 and Sony WF1000Xm3). I am not saying this is better than all of them (because Headphones do have better noise cancellation) but I can definitely say that  AirPods Pro is my favorite earbuds. Only thing is that I'm using Samsung Galaxy Note 10 that I can't edit like iPhone users. But the sound quality, comforts, and Noise Cancellation are great!  Great product!",5,1,2020-3-14,1,0,0
"My earpods got kettle sound, noise whenever I put them in my ear, sometimes I sleep wearing them to block the noise out. but I would be woken up by this sharp noises. instead of noise canceling. It's high-pitch noise creating headphons. very disappointing.

"The sound quality is fantastic and the noise cancellation is amazing, if you travel on airplanes or trains a lot it‚Äôs incredible how much unwanted ambient noise these babies cancel out. They also have a very good battery life, and the case charges them extremely fast. Bluetooth range on them is great as well, when I‚Äôm cleaning the house I can walk all the way from my upstairs office down into the kitchen without them missing a beat.

"There are many options when it comes to truly wireless earphones but the airpods might be the most known and for good reason. Apple added noice cancellation to the pro which pushed me to buy it even as an Android user. I am impressed with the sound quality and the noice cancellation, the noice cancellation isn't over ear headphone quality but for an in ear headphone it's phenomenal. I would recommend these earphones to anyone even non apple users.",4,1,2020-5-16,1,1,0
"I was trying to decide between the Apple AirPods Pro and the PowerBeats Pro, and ultimately decided to invest in the AirPods. Having not had luck with Apple earbuds in the past - giving me sore ears, falling out, etc. - I was hesitant, but reviews convinced me otherwise. And I'm very glad I purchased these.I've used these earphones for exercising (both cardio and weights), working from home, and for various phone calls. I have yet to experience these earphones falling out. I really love the added feature that allows you to check how secure each earbud is, and that the fit is customizable. I don't anticipate any problems with them falling out in the future, nor having any pain from prolonged use.",5,1,2020-4-3,1,0,0
"I guess I had higher expectations since they were so damn expensive. My main motivation was to use these while I verbally cued and physically demonstrated fitness via Zoom to keep a consistent, clear volume of my voice while I taught. Nope, this is not where these shine. My computer‚Äôs mic was more clear as these made my voice somewhat gravely. They don‚Äôt stay in my ears as efficiently as I had hoped-I definitely won‚Äôt use them during any HIIT classes and if I‚Äôm using them as noise cancellation, it‚Äôs a major fail. Yes, the battery life is amazing, if I‚Äôm just sitting, listening to music, yes, they‚Äôre great... but so are my old headphones at a fraction of the price.",3,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0

Very please with my purchase of Airpods pro. I have small ears and needed earbuds that wouldn't cause a lot of pain.These come with 3 size soft ear tips for a good comfortable fit. The features to change songs and alternate between on/off... works very easily. The sound quality if pretty fabulous and then stay put when I am running- that is a big deal.

"The Airpod Pros are terrific.  Initially, I was content with the Airpod 2nd gen model but the Pros are definitely worth the upgrade in my opinion.

These are my new go-to wireless earbuds and they pair so easily with my Apple-friendly household.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0

"It was a tough decision to buy these at first, but after lots of research I believe I made the right choice! The Airpods Pro have much better sound than the predecessors, have great transparency and noise cancellation modes, and most importantly STAY IN YOUR EARS! The original Airpods would always ""fall out"" of my ears and I would constantly adjust them every few minutes or so, and seeing that the Pros have tips that go in the ear definitely pushed my decision to buy these. After they arrived, I immediately put them in and tried the different modes and was just amazed with everything about the Pros. I haven't had any problems with them yet, whereas I've had several with the original Airpods. This purchase was definitely worth it, and I love my Airpods Pro.I would also suggest getting a simple silicone case for them to preserve and protect the white case. My original Airpods case has tons of scratches and I'm assuming the Airpods Pro case would be no different.",5,1,2020-2-3,1,0,0
"Great product. Sound is pretty good for the price, noise cancelling is great during subway and train commutes and on the plane. Used to work out, they stay in your ear comfortably while running.

"Sound quality is great, but about the same as standard AirPods. The noise cancellation feature is absolutely incredible. I don't like how instead of tapping the ear piece to skip tracks or pause, it's now a pinch motion on the stem. It's pretty impractical while working out or running. Also you only get the charging cable. No block. And it's not a standard USB cable. So over $200 on the pair and still had to go out and buy another piece to be fully functional. I probably wouldn't have gotten the pros based on the ""upgraded features"".",3,1,2020-8-28,1,0,0
"Honestly, i was sketch about these, and the main reason is that i am very particular to my skull candy head phones that have great quality. First i want to say this, the head phones are a little big for my ears so it took getting used to, like wearing for a few hours and pulling them out when they hurt and then putting them back in later to get my ears to adjust. However i want to say that because of this i almost returned the ear phones. It was until i was able to really see how seamless the process of getting them connected to was i keeping them for that, the noise cancellation is really cool. They even have an option in setting to get the right fit ear bud in it. The audio is ok, not the best but not bad. I still think my skull candys are better for quality but over all these will be kept for the convenience it gives to me.",5,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
The product was awesome and I loved them. Then after having them for a little less then a month a heard rattling inside my right earbud. I thought it was very annoying when my music stopped and I have noise cancelation on. So the next day the earbud crapped out and wouldn't sync with other earbud. If I sync it by itself it just static. So basically a had it for one month and the right earbud broke from internal reasons.,2,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0

I‚Äôm still trying to figure out which rubber earpiece fits me best, so they don‚Äôt come out during my workout. That happens to me with every in ear headphone I have tried.

I had my AirPods Pro in my ears, Apple Watch 4, and of course my Iphone Max in my pocket. Got to shore, took out the AirPods and rinsed everything.

"Battery life isn‚Äôt the greatest for the actual AirPods - but the case is so convenient and they charge so fast it isn‚Äôt an issue.  The best in ear noise cancellation I have found - sound it great but not amazing - they are not for die hard music addicts that want bass and loud music.  But the music sound is way better than most, the noise cancellation is adaptive and easy to switch off when needed.  Pairs amazing with all apple products and work great with 1 or both in ear for talking.  All in all- great. Amazon had a special price - less than anywhere for new (refurbished were 10 bucks less but -ewwww no thanks.

Magnificent. I had AirPods (non-Pro) and they had trouble detecting insertion into my right (but not left) ear from day one. These do not have that problem.

Hate in ear head phones because they hurt my ear and would skip out very easily but these are a game changer. They somehow stay in place and does not hurt at all!

I had the old air pods and they got into my ears fine. These seem to shift and move around when I have them in and talking.

"I don't normally write reviews, but I'm sick of these headphones; I'm constantly having problems with them. First it was crackling in one earbud. So I sent it in and they sent me a replacement. Now the other side is starting to have the same problem. All along there has been connectivity and charging issues. These headphones are supposed to disconnect when they're put back in the case to charge. With mine I'll put them in the case overnight, put my headphones in the next day, and find that one side (it alternates as to which side it is) is dead, this is because one side will occasionally stay connected to bluetooth from inside the case and thus not charge. I'm just tired of it all. For $250, these headphones shouldn't consistently have all of these problems, all the time. The noise cancellation and transparency modes are nice, when the headphones ever work. But for this kind of money I could have bought another brand without all the headaches.",2,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0

"The only issue I have been having is at random times they make a shock noise and i have to take the ear bud out and put it back in the case.Things that could be improved on is another level of noise cancellation, because admittedly it doesn‚Äôt totally cancel out all the noise e.g.  if you‚Äôre in a public area. Lastly, it would be nice if the case itself had a ‚Äúfind my‚Äù feature because I had trouble finding it a few times now and it would be so much easier if it had a tracking to it.",3,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0
"Huge upgrade from AirPods series 1. Use it with my iPhone 11 Pro, and it connects almost instantly. Sound quality is significantly improved from the series 1, to the point it‚Äôs basically like a new device. That being said, connectivity for calls was my biggest need, and it‚Äôs working really well in that regard. Sound cancellation is high quality, and transparency mode is a actually more useful than I anticipated.",5,1,2020-7-13,1,0,0
"I love these. They make Google Meets and Zoom meetings much easier on my MacBook Pro. I open the charging case and take the earbuds out and they automatically connect. It reduces feedback and allows me to move away from my computer if I need to. It‚Äôs really changed the way I‚Äôve been able to work.

I have the high end Sony headphones that go over your ear, which also work great, but my son is starting distance learning so I gave those to him.

I have had the very first airpods it lasted 2 years of heavy use after 2 years the battery was just not lasting long and from the sweat the bottom part clogged with green residue and the mic had stopped working on the left piece. These were 2 years of heavy use. I just got these pros and so far so good battery lasts for a long time. Sound quality is decent not the best. It is so easy to use.

I use both pairs - when the battery runs low on one set, I switch them for the other. So I'm reminded everyday of the differences.here's no contest - the original (and cheaper) AirPods are superior to the pros. If I had known this, I would have just bought a 2nd set of the original AirPods. In summary,  the originals:",4,1,2020-6-12,1,0,0

"Although some may find it expensive, I recently upgraded from the 1.0 Apple Earpods and I am glad I did. All around it is just a better earpod from the clarity, noise cancellation ability, and they just feel more snugly fit. I like the noise transparency feature. It is convenient so you don't have to remove your pods to hear your surrounding. Also, I can finally wirelessly charge them on a Qi charger. I gave away my old 1.0s to my sister and I don't regret upgrading.",5,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
"So I lost my original pods and decided to try out the new ones. Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt impressed at all. Also if you‚Äôre not comfortable with pods with rubber inserts these are no different. Ears got tired and painful after about 30 min even with the different sized ear inserts. Also the bluetooth connection is s_ _ t! It crapped out on me after about a week of use so only one pod would work at a time even after numerous repairing attempts. It‚Äôs nice that the nub is shorter and less in the way but the actual head speaker is larger as well so beware of that for smaller ears. (Although with the different sized rubber inserts the issue of fit could be fixed.my opinion, Stay with the OG pods! Much more comfortable and cheaper too! And the sound proof qualities ate always much better with over the ear headsets in my opinion.

"I was against AirPods for the longest time, similar to my hatred for business men with Bluetooths back in the day. Fast forward, my husband bought them for me and I can‚Äôt stop using them. The list of what they are convenient for is astonishing. From business to pleasure I have been utterly satisfied. Meditating at home but dogs or kids are too loud, not an issue. Want to take a nap but you are afraid of getting twisted in cords, no problem. 4 stars because if your ears sweat and you are working out it can be a bit difficult to manage them.

"Bit the bullet and splurged on these air pod pros...UNFORTUNATELY...I was Badly Disappointed! The noise cancelling is pretty good if you don‚Äôt mind the negative pressure effect (like change in elevation does to your ears). The best feature in my opinion is Siri reading your msgs to you. The big issue is the darn things just do not stay in my ears. The silicone tips create a seal in your ears when you  insert them but that only lasts a few minutes. Hopefully my opinion will help those thinking of splurging on these.  I have returned them for a full refund and will go with the power beats pro, may lose a bunch of features but at least they will stay put when in my ears. I would not recommend the AirPod pros to anyone which is hard for me to say because I love apple products. Airpods 2gen were great and I totally recommend them over the pros.",2,1,2020-4-14,1,0,0
"I‚Äôve grown accustom to high quality products from Apple, but the new AirPods Pro is simply a huge miss.  Test: touch your finger to the inside of your ear and either talk to someone or chew a piece of gum.  What do you feel? Of course you‚Äôre feeling your inner ear move. What do we do when we have our AirPods Pro in our ear you ask? We talk to people!  Well, the darn things will not stay in my ears. I‚Äôve tried all 3 adapters and nope, they all fall out. But what happens even more often when I have to readjust them while talking,  I accidentally press the poorly positioned button that ends the call. Over and over again this happens. Now, try getting these things out of the case quickly when an important call is coming in?!?! Good luck!!  Too many dollars for an inadequate product.

I previously owned the beatsx with foam tips and that set up proved better sound and passive noise cancellation than the AirPods. I like to think it‚Äôs because the silicone tip on the AirPods do not cover my ear canal completely. I do recommend these over the regular AirPods due to the noise cancellation and silicon tips.

Unfortunately, my right ear doesn't hold the AirPod in if I get sweaty from working out, and I've had both fall out alternatively as I got sweaty, but honestly, the sound makes up for it.I do wish there was a way to skip a song or change the volume within the AirPods themselves, but they're already so small and sleek, so I can't really complain.

"I really enjoy these earbuds. They aren't perfect as many fans of Apple would lead you to believe. I find it them to fit uncomfortably. the main part of the AirPods themselves are a lot bigger and bulkier.  (To understand better see photos.) The original AirPods of fit perfectly for me. So i had believed that these would be similar. I assure you they are not. Looking past that, the sound quality is very very good. Similar to the original AirPods they have more punch and ‚Äòbass boost‚Äô sound. The noise cancellation isn‚Äôt perfect but it truly gets the job done. Transparency mode is quite helpful. I have trouble hearing conversations and voices but transparency mode give a slight amplification to outside sound. The battery life is shorter than the 1st generation AirPods, but given the new modes it‚Äôs understood why it will have a shorter battery life. Overall, its a great upgrade in the right direction, but has some flaws to polish out for a new design.",4,1,2020-5-14,1,0,1

I wear these all the time, sometimes with one airpod in my ear so I can balance listening to podcasts while doing activities. It also supports audio sharing natively which is a great feature to use with friends. On top of that, Apple is actively improving the AirPods via firmware upgrades with spatial audio coming as part of iOS 14. My only gripe is its shorter battery life compared to competitors like the Sony WF-1000XM3s or PowerBeats. However, the seamlessness and great ANC makes up for it very quickly.

My ears aren't built like everyone else's apparently - I can't use ear buds unless they're 'in-ear' - the others just fall out, so that's my favorite feature!  Even at Apple prices, I have no regrets.",5,1,2020-7-27,1,1,0

"This is the first Apple product I have ever owned that I have had such trouble with. One ear bud or the other won't work sometimes, phone callers can't hear me and I can't hear them once I answer and now, they will no longer connect to my phone. I have a sneaking suspicion that these are knock-offs. DO NOT WASTE $200+ ON THESE. BUY THEM DIRECTLY FROM APPLE!!",1,1,2020-6-8,1,1,0
It‚Äôs an upgrade over the traditional Airpods and quite subjective. The noise cancelling is the key and it‚Äôs one of the easiest to use in my opinion. It‚Äôs not as good as the Bose or Sony in the airplane but it‚Äôs easy. AirPods create a virtual environment by playing with your head and that‚Äôs how the noise cancelling happens. It‚Äôs very subjective and you may like it and may not.,4,1,2020-3-23,1,0,0

"There are way too many things for me to say on how much I love these earbuds so simply... The sound quality is amazing and the BASS is just right, Works very well with the rest of my Apple products.

"if you like listening to music with headphones that are comfy, block out outside noise, and you don‚Äôt have to turn up to block out the noise, these are the headphones for you. Although they are 250 dollars, once you buy them you know you spent your money well. the sound quality is crisp and clear however, if your more of a bass heavy person, go to the settings of whatever music platform you are using and turn on bass boost. the noise cancellation is amazing for when your riding the bus, in a gym, or even on planes. voices won‚Äôt get completely blocked out but they do get a lot quieter. also, if your a workout type of person or you wear headphones in the rain these are perfect, just wouldn‚Äôt recommend using them in the rain all the time.",5,1,2020-1-1,1,0,0
"I bought the original AirPods when this first came out in 2016 for college. When I was packing for graduation, I lost my originals and was debating whether to upgrade to these. I originally bought these from BestBuy and i would recommend just ordering off Amazon. The ones I got from BestBuy were faulty and noise cancellation was not working a day later. These work just fine and I didn't have to waste time commuting to pick them up. On top of which they're $15 cheaper than the apple store. Great job amazon at making these easy to purchase!",5,1,2020-2-29,1,0,0
"Best gym headphones I've ever had. Great battery life.  Fits and STAYS in ear! The click to skip features are a thousand times then the regular airpod tap function.The noise cancelling is such a cool feature, especially once you turn transparent mode on.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0

I use them mostly for listing to audiobooks and classical & jazz music while walking and running.  They are great for blocking street noise.  It takes a bit of trial and error to get the earpieces sized correctly for a tight fit and you will find that using the noise cancellation and tight fit will make them somewhat uncomfortable after 3-4 hours.,5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0
"It hurts in my ears if I smile and despite the three different ear tips, these do still do not fit well in my ears. The transparency and noise cancellation features are nice and work as expected but for more than $200 I expect them to not constantly fall out of my ears when I move or feel uncomfortable when moving my facial muscles. They fall out if I sweat a little, walk, if I smile too big, or even when I am sitting and talking - basically all the time. I even used the ear tip fit test on the iPhone to make sure I had the best fit along with trying all the other ear tips and they still don't stay in my ears well. Sound quality is very good but definitely not the best of the best. Overall disappointed in my purchase.",2,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
These air pods are amazing!  The sound is beyond good but the best part for me is that they do not hurt my ears - they are comfortable.  I had tried a couple of other brands and it was difficult to get them seated in my ears and they really hurt.  These cost a lot but not much more than some of the others that have must less quality.  I would buy them again!,5,1,2020-7-25,1,0,0
"The AirPods Pro are genuinely worth their price. For all the fuss about ‚ÄúApple Price tag‚Äù, for its features it is competitively priced against Sony‚Äôs noise canceling buds and they do it better! Not just noise canceling but in every way. Sony‚Äôs is a bit too bulky and not easy enough to slip into your pocket without adding yet another huge bulge your phone and wallet already does. The AirPod pros are slim and only 10% bigger than the OG AirPods. But Apple gives up battery life to be able to be slim but only about 4-5 hours under Sonys. I love these for the gym and they definitely look a lot better than the comically looking AirPods before it was worn into trending status. It‚Äôs ease of use and integration makes it compelling to buy it over Sony‚Äôs If you have a iphone. Overall great 8/10",5,1,2020-2-8,1,0,0
"I was excited to try out the AirPods pro and see how they compare with other truly wireless earbuds. The Pro's were going to serve as my on the go earbud as well, something I might take to the gym. I like the idea of these earbuds, but the execution is severely flawed. I have no problem paying a premium price for a superior product. Unfortunately, the sound quality of AirPods Pro does not translate at all to the sticker price. The noise-canceling and transparency modes are nice features to have but still don't justify the price point or improve upon the audio quality. If you're looking for an ok sounding earbud that easily syncs up with all your Apple products, this is it. However, if you don't want to spend over $220 or want higher fidelity audio, there are better options out there.",3,1,2020-4-29,1,0,0

Only had it for like a week and I‚Äôve been using them everyday it‚Äôs great sound quality is great good it has ok bass battery life haven‚Äôt noticed to much but most of time I wear them and take them off they lasted quite a while without giving me warnings AirPods are gonna die noise cancellations is pretty good I‚Äôve never used any headphones with noise canceling before to me it‚Äôs pretty good,5,1,2020-5-1,1,0,0
"If you have small ears, don't get them. I currently have scabs in both ears because the seam presses up against my crus or helix in my ear has been irritating my ears (the left one in particular) to the point of bleeding. I'm returning them.Listen to everyone else about the sound, they're great on that.",3,1,2020-4-22,1,1,0
Why did I not buy these things sooner??  The quality is amazing.  The noise cancellation works great as well as the standby.  They didn't come with a charging cable that I can use but I had a charging pad already so I don't even need a cord.  Apple puts out a nice product but they are a little pricey.  I think it is worth it for my case and working from home all the time.,5,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase.  These headphones are comfortable, the noise cancelling is excellent and the sound quality is very good - much better than regular airpods, and what I would expect for a premium wireless earbud, but the sound quality is not likely to impress true audiophiles.I wasn‚Äôt sure if these would be as convenient as my AirPod 2 earbuds, but they have replaced them in daily use entirely.  While they are not as comfortable as my Sony WH-1000XM3 over the ear headphones, the noise cancelling is almost as effective and has reduced my use of the Sony headphones to only extended use sessions.",5,1,2019-12-28,1,0,0

"I upgraded from the first AirPods model (no wireless charging case) for the noise cancellation features without having clunky over-the-ear headphones. While they don‚Äôt last as long as the other models, these are definitely worth spending the extra $100 over, especially if you consistently use earbuds daily. The only issues I‚Äôve had are dealing with them falling out of my ears on the occasion, that‚Äôs likely due to the size of the ear tips.",5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0

"Lasted two weeks!!!!Sound is pretty cool, I wanted this pods for a while now. Arrived quickly, the day after I purchased to be exact. For me they feel comfortable in the ear better than the regular none wireless earphones from apple or the classic AirPods. The sound cancelation and transparency works good! SADLY the pods I received where damaged/defected after two weeks of not much of used really, the left AirPod stop charging(I would always use both at the same time) I will place BOTH in the case and it would be a green light instead of red one. If I press hard down the left one it would change the color to RED!! Once I stop pressing it would get back on green, look at the pictures. I don‚Äôt know if we are reviving used or wrong manufacture items in amazon. Don‚Äôt take your chances just get them in Apple. Oh yeah I‚Äôm returning them for FREE.

"These fit your ears well, have great noise cancellation, and connect to iPhone well. The big drawback is that there is a known apple issue that still hasn't been resolved when using them with your mac for video conferencing or calls that renders them useless.When trying to do video conferencing or calls on a MacBook the sound quality is TERRIBLE, people consistently say my voice sounded muffled and gargled. I tried all known workarounds (having the computer use internal mic instead of Airpod pro mic, paying $5 for an app called Toothfairy that supposedly helps override this and forces computer to use AAC format, calling apple support, etc.",2,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0

I had the AirPods before but I lost them. I decided to buy the AirPods Pro since that happened. I had been wanting to buy these anyway because the AirPods always fell out of my ears when I worked out. I would sweat and they would slip out. These are great because they stay in my ears. I use the small size silicone tips. They fit perfectly. They never fall out when I walk on a hike or workout at the gym. The nose cancellation is really good too. I like these much more.

The noise cancellation really blew me away and still does its really nice. An the seamless pairing with iphones is a wonder making the over value of the Airpods even better. The other features like the squeeze to turn noise cancellation on and off are really nice and just elevate the product even more. I would recommend if you are and iPhone user to pick up a pair of Pros.",5,1,2020-6-3,1,1,1
They actually stay secured in my ears unlike the original air pods. Thanks to the silicone attachments. I can lean over with the older style and they fall right out of my ears. These stay nice and secure. Love how you press on the stems and you can hear the click in your ear for play/pause and such. I could never get the older style to respond by tapping on them.Huge improvement overall. The secureness in my ears and the pressing on the stems are my favorite features.,5,1,2020-4-16,1,0,0
"I brought these from amazon on March 25th to replace a pair that I lost.

I wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect when ordering these because you see adds for headphones all of the time just to be disappointed by quality. With the Apple air pod pros I can honestly say I was not disappointed. The first thing that shocked me was the noise cancellation. These literally clear out everything and make it so easy to zone out and just vibe with whatever you‚Äôre listening to. No joke. The sound doesn‚Äôt get extremely loud like I know some people like but it‚Äôs perfect because they lock into your ears and cancel other noises so they really compensate in other ways. I would definitely order these again!,5,1,2020-6-1,1,0,0
Worked great for 3 days and then they wouldn‚Äôt connect to my phone. Apparently some AirPods Pro have different firmware in each AirPod so they stop connecting and it‚Äôs a hassle. They say it‚Äôs like a glitch in them. Anyways I bought a new pair and haven‚Äôt had the problem! I love them. Especially the transparency setting.

The bass has improved way better than the previous versions of AirPods. The only negative point I noticed is the price. Overall, they works just fine.",5,1,2020-9-7,1,0,1
"These headphones are great. I had the original ones for a long time until my dog got a hold of one of them and chewed it. Instead of repurchasing the same ones, I opted to get the pro‚Äôs since I know they had more features like noise cancellation, transparency mode, and spatial audio(coming this year with the software update). Initially, I had some trouble fitting them in the ear but the extra size tips helped the headphones give a better fit to my small ears. They paired to my iPhone 11 Pro as soon as I opened the cases. Love that it integrates to my iPad and Mac air seamlessly. As someone that listens to music almost daily, I found myself listening to music at a lower level than I did with my original AirPods. Would highly recommend these.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0

Used them on a flight from New York to Phoenix, and was able to have them on the noise cancelling mode the entire flight (5.5 hrs), while using them in the airport (transparency mode) before and after the flight.

However... every so often, one of the pods, the left usually, doesn‚Äôt charge when it‚Äôs in the case. Then, when I‚Äôm ready to use them, usually on a run, I‚Äôm left with just one pod working. Very frustrating! There must be a problem with the connection from the case to the pod, but I can‚Äôt see anything wrong. Anyone else have this problem?",5,1,2020-5-3,1,0,0
"The headphones cancel out everything, even a train going by in front of me. There is an option to have some noise come through and that is perfect. I pair them with my phone and apple watch without any problems. They stay in my ears great unless I bend over but I've learned to be quick to catch them. I couldn't be happier!",5,1,2020-4-15,1,0,0
"I use these airpods every day on my run, and they are fantastic for it. I was concerned that if I sweat heavily they would destroy or damage the airpods pro, but they haven't, and they've actually been fantastic. I don't notice them slipping out unless I sweat pretty heavily that day, and even then it's just a quick push back into my ear. The transparency mode is great for when I want to listen to music or watch something, but I still want to be somewhat aware of my surroundings. The only thing that could be better is the Active Noise Cancelling. I had read somewhere that the ANC was great, but after a firmware update the quality of the noise cancelling had gone down. Not too big of a concern for me though. They also smell like blueberries which I love.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
Oh my god. These are the best AirPods ever. They have great sound system and we‚Äôre great for the price I pass $250 after taxes! I love them. Literally they are always in my ears.,5,1,2020-6-9,1,1,0
"Sound Quality, battery life and noise cancellation is decent - but not as good as my other head phones. Most importantly my ears started hurting after wearing them for an hour. They are bigger than Gen 1 & 2. Tried all the tips. I don't feel comfortable wearing them. They even fell off couple of time, if you try not to push inside the ear to have a good fit. Painful. My worst buy from Apple so far. Never disappointed by Apple before, but it's not the case this time. Have to use them as back up.",3,1,2020-4-21,1,0,0
"The sound quality is phenomenal.  The noise cancellation is very good ... nearly as good as my Bose over-ear headphones.

"This is by far the best ear buds I've owned -- even better than the Bose Soundsports I own and reviewed.  There is no lag (none) when playing videos (i.e. Roku, Netflix, Prime, etc.) via your phone or home computer.  I cannot believe I waited this long to buy these.  Great for workouts as well, although they tend to occasionally slip out, but I suspect this can easily be fixed by purchasing ""wing tips"" or some other method.",5,1,2020-9-19,1,0,0

"I've had lots of Apple products, and they have always EXCEEDED expectations.  This one disappointed. The charger cable is a new USB-C, and there is no brick included with the air pods.  Therefore, the cable is useless.  I can use my other traditional cables, but what's the point of putting in a cable I can't use?  Really Apple, you could afford to include the $15 brick.  Sad that such a great company has turned into a skinflint.",4,1,2020-4-23,1,1,0
I am a big fan of Apple AirPods and think these are the best yet! I recently used the noise canceling feature while on a plane and was super happy with the results. I was able to leave my bulky travel headphones at home and enjoy watching movies at a normal volume. This is the best Bluetooth headset I have ever owned.,5,1,2020-9-27,1,0,0
"I have small ears and I usually have trouble keeping headphones on my ears for more than 5 minutes (unless they attach around the ear like the beats). These headphones are really comfy and crystal clear with amazing sound quality. I would say that I am not all that impressed by the noise-canceling - I can still hear sounds around (granted, much less than on traditional headphones). It is perfect if you use them to speak on the phone or attend online meetings.",5,1,2020-9-21,1,0,0
When i Decided to get new AirPods I really wasn‚Äôt expecting these to work that well .WOW when you use noise canceling mode it works very well you can feel in your ear leaving no sound able to come though the transparency mode is super cool you can still hear your surroundings very well and listen to music just as good i have had no better experience with headphones i would recommend buying !!,5,1,2020-6-25,1,1,0
"The noise canceling works best if you use the larger ear buds, but larger ones are more noticeable in the ears.I also discovered that my tinnitus (which usually is drowned out by background noise ) is now more obvious and annoying.

"As far as music quality, noise cancellation, and battery life, the new AirPods are great but there is much left to be desired for audio quality when making phone calls and ear security. These DO NOT stay in your ears if you are moving around. I bought them for the sole purpose of working out and they come loose with any type of up and down motion. I am constantly pushing them back into my ears and terrified that they are going to fall out and break or plunge into a sewer grate never to be seen again. If you are getting these for causal listening at your desk, it‚Äôs a great product. If you are planning to use them for any type of active lifestyle, I would stick with the original ones.",2,1,2020-7-23,1,0,1
"I love these headphones...when they actually connect with my phone.  Sound quality is great, but more often than not, the Bluetooth will disconnect at random times during my workout.  I was a mile into a long run and the headphones disconnected unexpectedly and wouldn't reconnect.  I wouldn't recommend for anyone who intends to use these on their workouts or doesn't like to fiddle around with disconnecting and reconnecting the bluetooth to try and get their headphones to work.",2,1,2020-3-7,1,1,0
"I got these as a gift for Father‚Äôs Day. He set them up and was amazed with the noise cancelling since that was the first thing he noticed. They are pretty sleek looking. Everything about these is worth the price though we both questioned about charging. The box came with a charging cord but to plug in to charge the wireless charger, you would need an adapter as it was noted in the little booklet. Without the adapter, you are able to charge the wireless case using the standard Apple charger. Other than the charging mishap, everything seems fine and easy to set up since there is a step by step guide.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"I absolutely loved them! Great quality for sound and noise cancellation.But since I started using them, as you can never turn them off while in your ears (I have to keep them on even just because of the outside noise at work), I started to have headaches then migraines daily üò¢. I had to return them.",5,1,2020-9-12,1,0,0

"Great sound quality and very well balanced equalizing. Noice canceling feature is like being transferred into another world. The outside world just get so soft when you have them on. I do miss the music control from the Air pod Gen 1. Battery last all day, they are so naturally setted in your ear that i do sometimes forget that i'm wearing them. It would have been nice if they gave you A/C wall piece. They do send a newer lightning cable to charge but i have no cube that it fits in. But thank black baby Jesus that it has wireless charging and the charge time is quick for both the pods and the charging case. Range is incredible. I have already recommended (demanded) people go out and get their on set.",5,1,2020-4-13,1,0,0

"Wasn't sure about these since I have the regular Airpods.  The AirPods are always good, but these are like being in the concert hall.  The phone quality is excellent!  And such ease of use.  Just watch a video and you know how to do everything with them.  Just lay them on a charging pad to charge - no more messy wires!  Great Job Apple!",5,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0
"Great product! Convenience and minimalism at its best! The noise cancellation is mind blowing! it literally beats all the cons about the product. It connects quickly and connects easily to any non-apple device.The sound quality is okayish, I expected a distinctive quality of sound from apple, like we get from Bose or JBL for the price, but was disappointed there. Im using a non apple device not sure if thats the reason. But also on research I found out that other competitors similiar to this in the market have the ear buds penetrating further in which might damage the ear drums in the long run. But apple has taken care not to keep it safe for people to use, which explains the low sound too.",3,1,2020-6-29,1,0,0
"They work great for a basic user. I mostly use them for working out at home and cleaning / around the house tasks. I have had them fall out a time or two while working out, mostly while doing ab work close to the floor so just be cautious if you plan on using at the gym. Other than that, they make answering the phone and hands free amazingly easy and I highly recommend them for anyone that just wants everyday headphones. I think the sound quality and noise cancelling are great, but I‚Äôm also not a reviewer who has tons of other options to compare. I mostly got them for ease of use and they excel greatly there.",5,1,2020-1-7,1,0,0
"The best AirPods Apple has made. I‚Äôve owned both AirPods gen 1 and gen 2 both in wireless charging and normal type. If you‚Äôre an iPhone user, this is very handy and you‚Äôll cherish for having it. I wear it almost 6+ hours daily on weekends and 9+ hours on workdays. The best thing is you won‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs presence since it‚Äôs really comfortable to wear. Like all my Apple goodies I love my AirPods Pro. I‚Äôve only one wish and that‚Äôs Apple making it in different color options like space grey and silver.",5,1,2020-6-2,1,0,0
"My overall rating for the AirPods Pro is five stars only because Apple products are simply the best personal electronics out there. Actually I'm a huge Apple guy. Currently I have eight apple products being used. However, if anyone interested in purchasing the AirPods Pro has an issue with finger dexterity or tactile sensation, these are not for you. I struggle with that issue, therefore they are very difficult for me to grasp and to insert into my ears. They are quite small and made of very slick material, just as the originals. They were so cumbersome for me to use because I was consistently dropping them while picking them up and dropping them while putting them in my ears, etc. That is the only reason I had to return them. They simply weren't functional for me.  Obviously, if you have none of those concerns, these are absolutely perfect for you.",5,1,2019-11-21,1,0,0
These are great but don‚Äôt buy them from Amazon. According to the serial number mine were already linked to another AppleCare account which means they are used. The case also creaks and the Bluetooth connection is kinda spotty. The ones from Amazon are pre owned and if u look at the version number it says 1.0.0. This is the first batch which had some issues associated with it. JUST BUY THEM FROM APPLE DIRECTLY,2,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0

I answered a call while mowing on a zero turn and I could hear the caller clearly. The caller said they could hear me with very little background noise.

"Many aspects of the Pro version AirPods have a better quality to them. The design of the case and Buds themselves are improved, with the AirPods having a rubber tip to customize, which fits snug inside the ear, versus the original AirPods which did not. Battery life is about the same, the pros last for close to 5 hours on a full charge in normal mode. In noise canceling they last about 4-4.5 hours.

Only complaint about these is that I couldn't register them for Apple care via web. I had to call to confirm proof of purchase because the date couldn't be validated. Noise cancellation is good.

"In the AirPod software is a little program to test to see the buds make an air tight seal. No matter what I tried, (changing ear tips, adjusting in ear) I could not get a good seal. After 1 email and 2 chat sessions with Apple, it still would not show a good seal. Without a good seal, the noise cancelling feature is useless. Plenty of other ear buds at a much better price.",1,1,2019-12-31,1,1,0
"This was a gift from my husband & I‚Äôm very happy with them. I have small ears & most Bluetooth earbuds are too big. I love the ability to adjust the size of these, they are comfortable.

"I Always wanted a pair of noise cancelling headphones that I was willing to drop some money on. Bought these because I am an apple fan. Everything about these earbuds is great! Good sound, convenient, and noise cancelling is great.EXCEPT... doesn't fit too well in the ear. I tested each earbud size and medium worked the best. But I was on a run and the airpod got sweaty and dropped out of my left ear. Now less than a week of having them, my left airpod is scuffed up from the pavement. Thought i needed to go down a size but that definitely doesn't feel natural in my ear. They didn't break, fortunately! But very frustrating that it has happened, particularly because I got these solely for jogging.",3,1,2020-5-27,1,0,0
"I was not sure I was going to be impressed with the noise cancellation from earbuds. I'm a big fan of the Bose noise-canceling products and didn't think Apple could do it as good in such a small package. Wrong. Great sound. Good noice cancelling. Very easy connection and use to Apple devices. Battery life could be a bit better, but there is a lot going on in those tiny earbuds.",5,1,2020-6-23,1,0,0
"The noise cancellation is awesome for blocking out consistent noises like Airplanes, but for voices it‚Äôs hard for it to cancel it out since voices aren‚Äôt predictable.

I have small ears and the feel much better than most ear buds.  Sound is better than most ear buds.  Would buy them again.",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"I use these with my Ipod touch, my samsung android phone and a bluetooth dongle attached to my computers. Works great and great sound quality. Noise reduction is really good. Battery life is less when in noise reduction mode. Easy controls on ear piece allows for music pause and easy change between noise canceling on or off. I like they are soft and fit entirely in the ear. Much better than other similar apple products.",5,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
"The only thing I wish for improvement is price. Getting to the same as normal Airpods would be asking too much, but somewhat in between the current price of Pro and non-Pro would be ideal and customers do not have a different choice so whatever. Sound is neutral, resolution is ok and dynamics is good. Don't own wf-1000xm3 so cant compare. Compared to my wi-1000x, sound quality is a bit worse yet tolerable, but everything else is better.

"This is must have if you own an iPhone! I was able to get this stacked with an AMEX promo, but i do recommend this even full retail price after using it.Syncs up with your iPhone seamlessly, it wirelessly charges and the ANC is pretty good for its size and form factor. The ANC is not going to top Bose or Sony over the ear cans, but for its size, it‚Äôs really to travel and not worry about the bulk of the big canned headphones.",5,1,2020-3-10,1,0,1

The ability to listen to your content or phone call while still being present in the world around you is so underrated and is absolutely essential for any future headphones I purchase. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for new headphones or might not be sure about upgrading from your old AirPods!",5,1,2020-6-22,1,0,0

"In my opinion the extra $100 is totally worth it, especially if you travel. My biggest complaint about my old airpods was their performance during a flight. I felt I got way too much engine noise.

I went to the Apple store and after taking a stern tone with the employee I convinced them to replace the broken AirPod.

I‚Äôm very disappointed with this apple product.  They only charge if you fiddle around with them when you put them in the charger.  I had the pods replaced just a few days ago and the same thing is happening.  If they are charging and you move the case they will lose its connection.  What good is a portable charging case if the air pods lose their charging connection.Sound and noise canceling are excellent.  Doesn‚Äôt do much good if you charged them for a future walk only to find out they didn‚Äôt charge.,2,1,2020-9-22,1,0,0
"Love these AirPods pro! Secure fit in my ears (unlike AirPods 2). Great sound quality, easy to use and noise cancelling is a huge when you live in a noisy city. Finally, I can hear podcasts/ movies while in the NYC Subway. Noise-cancelling gives a bit of pressure but it goes away fast. Still keeping my AirPods 2 just in case, but all Bose headphones are going away.",5,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"I am an Apple fan. Over the years I have bought several MacBooks, iPhones, and Apple accessories including AirPods. The AirPods Pro are the most inferior Apple products I have ever purchased. If you have struggled with silicone-tipped earbuds before, these will be no different except that, without the cord, the will fall to the ground. I did not have nearly as much difficulty with my regular AirPods. My advice: don‚Äôt pay the premium and stick with the older model.",2,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
The AirPods pro are a great upgrade to the AirPods 1st gen. The only downside is it‚Äôs not as comfortable for long listening sessions. But the versatility of noise cancelling and transparency makes up for it. Transparency is unreal you really feel like you‚Äôre not wearing any earbuds!,5,1,2020-1-14,1,0,0
"It took some trial and error with the tips to get them right. I have send the functionality on my phone to test the fit and it works!  The sound is amazing even bass is great.

I have always been a beats earbuds person! I had mine for about 6 years and then the wiring started to come out. Once the airbuds came out with the actual sizes I was interested and then once the noice cancellation feature was released I was sold!! These are seriously the best thing since sliced bread!!,5,1,2020-1-5,1,0,0
Will be returning!!I bought these 3 weeks ago to upgrade my 1st set.,2,1,2020-6-27,1,0,0
The fit of these is a little strange. I usually use small ear tips but for these I had to use large so it wouldn't hurt the cartilage above my ear hole. The sound is great but noise cancelation could use some improvement. The right earphone drains battery faster and has a bit more difficulty connecting to the phone when I put it in my ear. Sometimes I have to put it back in the case then take it out again for it to connect properly. It has a few flaws but overall a good purchase for someone who doesn't want to deal with wires.,4,1,2020-6-28,1,0,0
"These are actually my wife's and everyday I am told how much she loves them. She is not an audiophile so the sound works for her, not me.

"Worse than the first or send gen AirPods. The sound is garbage, the battery life is awful and the pain they create in the ear is annoying. Overall just stick with the classic AirPods cause these are over priced garbage.",1,1,2020-6-30,1,1,0
"I ordered these for my husband and he really enjoys them. He has sensitive ears so the gummy earpieces fit perfectly and do not irritate him.

"Be careful, defective products are out there and that‚Äôs what I got the first time.The right AirPod would drain 30% faster than the left one for me (for example, left one would read 74% and right would be at 44%), but thankfully Amazon sent me a new pair of these free of charge, I didn‚Äôt even have to pay for shipping to send the old ones back.

"I have the sony WF-1000XM3. Yes, the sony pair does sound better and cancel out the noise better. HOWEVER, you're basically getting these airpod pros for 20% off which undercuts the sonys. As an ios user it is definitely worth it with the apple user experience and optimization of the software. Android users are better off with the sonys just because they lose some user experiences they would have on a device running ios.",4,1,2020-9-18,1,1,0
"These sound nearly-or maybe as good as my over the ear Bose NC headphones.  Beautifully packaged.  The set-up consisted of putting them in my ears and my eye phone displayed a lovely rotating image of the Air Pod container and in minutes I was playing music.  I was able to test them later the same day on a bike ride and they felt secure and the noise cancelling worked extremely well even in the wind with traffic noise.  BTW, you can check the fit in settings also. Sound was good for speaking on the phone as well.  I wish the battery life was a couple hours longer-but they recharge quickly.  Great product!",5,1,2020-6-25,1,0,0

"The AirPods pro live up to the hype. The sound quality is solid, offering decent separation and a full range sound. There are some better sounding options out there in the price range though.

Battery life is pretty normal for these guys, and as with all Apple products they are simple to set up and use.",4,1,2020-2-28,1,0,0
"These are super high quality. The sound quality is incredible, and the noise cancellation is unbelievable! I have super small ear canals that earbuds never fit into.

I have tried various attachments that came with the pods but  it did not make any difference, I have hurt my ears at times because I am constantly pushing them into my ear so they do not fall out. they have great sound quality and the noise cancelling is great. They are good for regular use but definitely do not buy these if you plan to workout with them as they will fall out constantly, but if you are looking for a good sounding device for regular daily use then they are great.",3,1,2020-8-5,1,0,0

"Not sure if it's because they were purchased from Amazon and not Apple, but the displayed charge in each AirPod seems to fluctuate wildly in accuracy. For example, the iPhone states they're at 58% and 61% one moment and then you plug them in and they drop instantly to 10% and 12%.In this day of the increased proliferation of conference calling and Zoom meetings, it sucks not being confident that your audio isn't just going to cut out completely and unexpectedly on you.",2,1,2020-7-23,1,0,0
"I love all things Apple but I resisted buying these AirPods for as long as I could. Pros: sound quality, noise cancellation (perfect for ignoring my teen ) and good battery life. Cons: I love them really. I changed the earpiece because the original ones were a bit to big. I don‚Äôt completely like the fit but I just shove them back in. I would say if you can splurge get them. Think of it as an investment. It really is actually. I have no regrets.",5,1,2020-8-11,1,0,0
"So I'm sure plenty of people will point out that the quality of sound that you get, leaves something to be desired.I have found that the ""world mute"" button is incredibly relaxing for what little anxiety I have.

"I‚Äôve had Airpods since the release a few years ago and always thought they fit good. After these were announced I suddenly noticed so much more that my first gen Airpods kept slipping out and I kept using my shoulder to push them back in. And every time I would laugh they would slowly get pushed out! I got fed up of that, and fan noise in certain situations. So I ordered them off here and they are, amazing. I expected to use the small tips but apparently the large tips fit perfect. None slip and I can actually laugh and talk with these in. The noise canceling is top notch and all around worth the price.",5,1,2020-2-7,1,0,0
I had the prior generation of Airpods - but I've never been a big fan of the way the Apple ear buds fit.  These are so much better!  I love that the rubber parts have multiple sizes - I have a lot more faith that the buds will stay put.  Sound is great and play life is perfect.,5,1,2020-7-12,1,0,0

"AirPod Pro provides great noise cancellation, sound quality, fit, and has a very compact case. Wireless charging is almost an unnecessary ""nice to have"" feature.One thing to note is that battery life could be a little better and is certainly not industry leading. 4.5 hours for the AirPod Pro vs 6 hours for the direct compete Sony WF-1000XM3s. Still however, the AirPod Pros have a smaller case and more comfortable design in the ear.",5,1,2019-11-11,1,0,0
"The noise cancellation is the real star here. I mean it‚Äôs really impressive. They really set themselves apart from other headphones with this feature, which is easily enabled by touching the button on the AirPods (which also feels very cool). They stay in your ear in a variety of positions and come with three size choices for the rubber tip. I personally prefer the smallest size. It‚Äôs also worth noting how great the battery life is. In summary, the best pair of earbuds I‚Äôve ever bought.",5,1,2020-3-2,1,0,0

"These are definitely the right choice for you if you have an iPhone. They put out good sound (although I wish they would get a little bit louder), the case will charge the buds and will charge itself wirelessly, and they work seamlessly with the iPhone/Apple family of products.I have used other wireless earbuds in the past that were cheaper and I have to say that these beat them hands down.",5,1,2020-2-6,1,0,0

They fall out my ear too, but that‚Äôs also not apple‚Äôs fault for me having a weird ear size! The sound quality is also okay! I‚Äôve definitely have heard better from in ear earbuds. My beats sound much much better. Overall they‚Äôre good earbuds I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the price!

"I really enjoy these headphones. They have been great for conference calls so far. Switching between devices is super easy. As for icing on the cake, apple has really made the user experience wonderful. You can charge wirelessly, and putting them on, it doesn't immediately enable noise canceling, instead, it transitions into it (over a 1 second period). Its like being gracefully whisked away to another world. For me, the things that still bother me are the 4 hr battery life and the feel that it might fall out. Granted, they haven't fallen out yet, and have stayed in regardless of how I move my head (and I'm not being gentle). Wish they had one more smaller earbud size.",5,1,2020-8-17,1,0,0

I love how small they are and how great they fit as well as how well they worked with my iPhone. But the have severe distortion in almost all songs and crackling noise. I got help from Apple with updating to the new firmware which made it even worse and it also made the active noise canceling almost non existent. So I returned them because the replacements they were going to send me will also have the newest firmware which basically takes one of its best features away.

"If you've never tried ANC earbuds, these will be an absolute treat. When you pop these in for the first time, the silence you hear (or don't hear?) is deafening. These are great to use for people who can't wear normal AirPods like me, because of how they fit in your ear. The force touch squeeze controls are also much nicer than the simple tap/double tap that the AirPods have.",5,1,2020-6-16,1,0,0
Extremely disappointed in these!! By far the worst Apple product I have ever bought!! Will not stay in my ears even when sitting completely still!! It doesn‚Äôt matter which size earpieces i use. My regular AirPods fit me perfectly and cost half as much. I bought these specifically for their noise canceling ability. But that feature is completely useless since they won‚Äôt stay in or sealed. Also you have to physically click a tiny button to control the AirPods which is hard to reach and ends up knocking them out of your ear.,1,1,2020-8-31,1,0,0
"Needs more bottom end and this could just be me. Having said that I am comparing to beats. I have tried many and no one could beet the beats, until now. They work flawlessly between devises with great sound. I couldn't hear the mower with the volume set half.",5,1,2019-11-22,1,0,0
"The sound quality is ok. Noise cancellation is great. They fit into my ears very well.Right, if your charger port is traditional type A USB, the included cable is useless because it's type C USB. I will buy a new charger when iPhone 12 is released.",4,1,2020-9-1,1,0,0
Noise cancellation feature is pretty neat when first adjusting to using these. I sometimes have issues with remembering to charge the case. I have a wireless charger that I put the case on but sometimes it won‚Äôt charge wirelessly. Also have issues where they would be in the case and one AirPod will still be dead.,3,1,2020-8-13,1,0,0
"The noise cancellation works alright but only if it‚Äôs not too loud. i love the transparent mode for work. The battery life is great. Literally listen to them all day.

"In general I love these things. They are comfortable and the noise cancelling works well. It is slightly inconvenient to go back and forth between iPhone and lap top has you have to pair and re-pair the bluetooth every time. The battery life is not great if you are on Zoom calls all day - they often run out of juice on me in the afternoon if i have back to back calls with no time to re-charge.

About a month later (I'm not sure what had caused it) but after cleaning them like I usually do every couple days, i started hearing a rattling noise. Like there is something loose inside my left earbud. Idk what it is or if it had anything to do with cleaning it, but i did it the way apple suggested. It works just fine.

Very good sound Quality. Fits OK but not great. Fits better than the previous version. One of the reasons I got this was for it‚Äôs noise cancellation. It does not do that very well. Too bad.

"Hi I have been using these for 2 days now and love everything about them so far. My only complaint is that they start to hurt my ears after a while. It's mostly the top of my ear where the hard plastic piece touches and rubs against, I'm afraid this will only get worse with more use. I have also read about other people having pain inside the ear canal etc.If anyone has any tips or actions to take regarding this please help because I want to keep using these.

Nevertheless, I love them, cancels out my annoying sister never ending rants and stays in. Great buy!",5,1,2020-7-30,1,0,0
Noise cancellation Is amazing on these. Barely had them and noticed sometimes they sync and other times you have to forget the device and reconnect several times.

"Maybe it has to do with your ear canal but these do not cancel noise any better than normal airpods.  The sound quality is the same, just OK in my opinion.

"It is comfortable and light to wear, the voice is clear and not jarring in the ear, it is very convenient to answer the phone and listen to music, the call is smooth, there is no delay, the operation and connection method is very simple and convenient, the appearance is fashionable, white looks so clean! The most important thing is that the earphone cable is soft, which can be wrapped around the ear and can be worn outdoors.

"The fact that I can switch from Noise Canceling to Transparency Mode is extremely useful. The earbuds are a nice size. I like that they can‚Äôt fall out of my ears easily. The one thing I don‚Äôt like is I can‚Äôt stop the ear buds from charging if I only use them for a short period of time before putting them back in the case.

"While these aren't cheap, they are spectacular.  The quality is great, the sound is better and they are perfect.

I really wanted these to be superior earbuds but for the money it wasn‚Äôt what I expected. They are more of a nuisance than a pleasure to wear. It constantly slips out of ear.

Amazing wireless earbuds overall the experience is 10x better if you're using them on Apple products I prefer Android still they work well but they do have little hiccups here and there that can be annoying for example connection issues sometimes the sound can be echoey but all you need to do is disconnect and connect them again and this should fix that problem.I've encountered an issue where they would connect but as soon as they would it would freeze my video or sound would not play all you need to do to fix this is reset them and that should fix it I wish the battery life these,3,1,2020-9-13,1,0,0
I can't say enough positive things about how seamlessly these work. Serious thought has gone into integration into your life and ease of use. The down side is for the price they produce the same sound as a pair of $20 in ear headphones. They sounded fine to start with but I began to notice that they distort during complex pieces of music - not sure what the term is but the drivers are not agile enough. Tried multiple songs where I heard the issue against other headphones I own and cancelled out the music source being the issue. Would I buy them again - yes. Am I still disappointed - yes,3,1,2020-2-5,1,0,0

Had to return these earbuds although I was very excited to have them the sound was absolutely phenomenal and noise canceling worked perfectly. Sadly Apple made the earbud very big almost bulky and on top of that tips that add to the bulky earbud. I tried all tips and the small and medium slip out of my ear when minor movement. But the large don‚Äôt slip out but they hurt if I leave them in after 15min. They should of made the size universal like the AirPod Gen 1 and 2. Terrible earbud design but amazing features I‚Äôll wait to see if the Gen 3 has noise canceling.,2,1,2020-3-12,1,0,1
I can't believe the quality of the noise cancellation on these! It is really good. I've used them for exercising and I can barely hear cars when they pass by.

I bought these for teleconference calls mostly but truth be told I just wanted them. A) if you fit these to your ears; you can literally flip your hair and jump up and down and they go nowhere.

C) i fell asleep listening to music on these and I finally took them out of my ears around 3-4 am and my ears did not hurt one bit and they were still playing. These are definitely worth the splurge.,5,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
I love my AirPods. The sounds quality is amazing. The noise cancellation is great and I love the size of them. They are comfortable  enough I fall asleep with them in most nights. They connect fast and the battery life is great. They are perfect for working out and don‚Äôt fall out when I‚Äôm running. They don‚Äôt make my ears ache after hours of wear like my old headphones. The wireless case charge lasts a few days for me. 10/10 recommend.,5,1,2020-6-15,1,0,0

"So these are great ! Great sound, and noise cancellation is so good , I work at the airport and they work perfect when I‚Äôm there , that being said I still use my 1st gen AirPods , when I‚Äôm at the house , those are great when I‚Äôm at not to noisy environments, and when I put them on I feel like I don‚Äôt have them on .. I can‚Äôt say that about the new ones , as u can feel u have them on. Still they are both good and it just depends on what kind of environment you‚Äôre going to use them in .",5,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0

They are awesome... also smaller than the original AirPods that hang below ear and look funny.

"Awful sound quality, worst base ever. I was expecting much more for a 250$ earbuds. Airpods is much better where it's almost half the price, Sony WF is 10 times better. Almost every earbuds in the markets is 10 times better and cheaper. The only thing good about those airpods is the noise cancelation, it's not great but it's ok. Definitely not worth the money.",1,1,2020-5-9,1,0,0

"I bought these for their noise cancelling quality.  I love them!  They do the job perfectly.  A little hard to describe, but they give me pure sound with the noise cancelling on, while also being able to hear a car approaching, when I am out for a walk.  They are amazing.  There is no comparison to other inferior (less costly) brands.  I have tried them.

My second pair came promptly‚Äîit‚Äôs been over a week of use with no major issues. Noise cancellation is decent, sound quality great imho, but the pesky things become loose in my ear and fall out no matter the eartip size I use. My guess is that Apple made the tip too short. Unfortunate that I paid $250 for AirPods that won‚Äôt stay in my ears without constant readjusting.",3,1,2020-4-18,1,0,0
The originals would fit my ear perfect. The pros had an ok fit as long as I wasn‚Äôt active. I wear these in the gym and they would fall out every couple of minutes no matter which tip I had in.

"The AirPods Pro are great and very comfortable to use. The sound quality is terrific. Comparing them to a high dollar set of head phones, the noise cancellation is just OK; of course no one walks around in public with headphones on.

I had my AirPods Pro for about a month before the left one had a static sound every time I used a noise cancellation or transparency. I consistently had a problem with them falling out with all of the sizes of rubber tips that come with it.

Noise cancellation is a nice new feature. While it doesn‚Äôt completely block everything out it does reduce surrounding noises a great deal. The spoken text is a nice touch but having Siri text back afterwards is less than seamless. Quick charge and wireless charging are helpful features.

They tend to slip out of my ear....I find myself pushing it in throughout the day so that it won‚Äôt get lost. What I do like about them is the fact that the battery life is great & the sound quality is good. The noise cancellation is great as well.,4,1,2020-9-17,1,0,0

I am much happier with my normal Airpods compared to the pro. Finally had to buy a connector string to not lose the fallen one especially when I am running.",3,1,2020-5-20,1,0,0

I bought a pair to replace my regular AirPods which I gave to my daughter but after a few frustrating weeks traded them back. Major problem; they just keep falling out of my ear. Tried the many different adapters but nothing works. The old ones would never fall out even when running and on a 10k run they would pop out at least 5 times.I also had several bluetooth connectivity issues with my watch.

I've had the Air Pods Pro for about a week and am thoroughly impressed! I'm not a pro audiophile but the sound quality is just amazing! The adaptive EQ actually does a nice job of adjusting for each track so I find myself not fiddling with the EQ all the time.

Best headphones I‚Äôve ever used. But one thing ruins them. When your working out or eating something they feel like there going to come out although they won‚Äôt.

Overall Great sound and awesome option to have noise cancelling and transparency modes. Only problem I have with them and It is big problem is I ca‚Äôt get them to stay in my ear. I‚Äôve tried all size for ear inserts and none of them allow for the AirPods to remain in my ears. They constantly fallout. I will contact Apple for a solution. If this doesn‚Äôt work I will be returning. No point in having expensive headphones with great sound quality if they can‚Äôt stay in your ears.,2,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"The noise cancellation is not 100%. It's more like noise silencer.

I've now gone through two generations of Airpods. They are low quality and now I have another pair that I will have to send in to be replaced because the left pod's speaker seems to be busted. I used them rather infrequently and never worked out with them for fear that my sweat would somehow short circuit them (seems to have been the case with my other pair).There are better alternatives. Save yourself the cost. I only wish Applecare would allow me to get my money back.,2,1,2020-3-4,1,0,0

I think they‚Äôre overpriced for the quality and the fact that it slips out of my ears regardless of the various sized buds and the fit test they have.

These are good for a flight and you don‚Äôt want to change out to something bigger.  But they fall out much easier the button touches are not the same as the older model and frankly they suck.

I personally think they are the best noise cancellation buds out there. I also think the passive sound is the best. The audio quality is lacking but what made me return them is the static and crackling. They said it‚Äôs from a software update. I owned them the first week they came out and didn‚Äôt have this problem. Hopefully they‚Äôll get it fixed. The ease of use is what also sets them apart front the rest.

Better off getting the regular airpod. But you can choose to have noise cancellation or transperancy(where you can hear you‚Äôre surroundings).

Horrible noise cancelling ability. Save yourself the money and just get the normal airpods because the active noise cancelling sounds only slightly better than just having them in your ears with active canceling off.

Not worth the money but then again it is an overpriced apple product. Isn't that loud but it's wireless so what do you expect. Noise cancellation works pretty well.
