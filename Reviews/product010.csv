"Wow...just wow.  I figured this would be a cheap film, but it was a nice crystal clear piece of hard plastic that once applied was invisible and will clearly add scratch and break protection. Some have said it was hard to apply.  Before pealing off the film do a test fit and a hinged application (start at top near earphone). The iPhone X has a rounded glass screen and this protector ALMOST goes to the rounded edges.  Once you have figured out just where to start, peel off the film and apply (again, think hinge...start at the top, get that edge where it needs to be and drop rest.  Now, here is where the fun begins...if doing this under a good light, which is recommended, you will see the ""adhesive suck"" effect as I call it, in which the protector actually seats itself...no pressing...don't press.  It will seat itself, no bubbles.  Just let it do it, let gravity do its part.  I am using it with a Spigen case and it all looks great, works great.",5,1,2019-1-4,1,2,0
"Much better value than the $30 phone retailers ask for for screen protectors.  Easy to apply, comes with both wet and dry cleaning wipes to clean your screen with and stickers to help align the protector onto your screen.  Great value.  Will be purchasing again once I go through the 3 it comes with.",5,1,2018-11-15,1,1,0
This is the worst screen protector I’ve ever encountered . I put screen protectors on on a regular basis at my job . These are IMPOSSIBLEMind you this is also the second time I tried all three cause I got the original ones exchanged for the same reason. I clean it perfectly follow instructions but the last second you try to put it on and it sucks every particle in the air . That’s with never putting the sticky side face up.,1,1,2019-9-28,1,1,0
"Great product!  I got this screen protector for my wife’s phone and mine; we both love it! It’s a little tricky to place because you only get one shot. I put mine on first and it’s just a hair crooked, but I was able to place the screen protector on my wife’s phone with no problems. Maybe that’s why you get 3 in a package. If you screw up you can take it off and try again with a new one. The best part - the nearly identical product I almost bought at Target is $50. So glad I checked Amazon first!",5,1,2018-11-27,1,1,0
"First of all, this product does not come with a frame for easy installation.Second of all, when you apply this screen protector, you have small bubbles. When you try to get rid of them by rubbing to the ends of the screen, they divide again to form pesky miniature bubbles. These do not go away and remain bothering the aesthetic of your iPhone.",1,1,2019-9-29,1,7,0
"This is the second time i've ordered this item because i really like the quality and ease of installation. But the second one i received is not new.All three of the tamper tape seals have been removed and put back on and the box has been torn. Contents may be fine, may not. But i want confidence in receiving new product when i purchase from Amazon and pay a new price. I don't want to gamble, deal with disappointment and returns as if I'm buying stuff from a used reseller. This is happening too often lately on Amazon. Will return.",1,1,2020-4-10,1,6,0
"Product arrived on time and packaged to protect the product.  I received an email from the Seller with application instructions prior to the arrival of the screen protector.  It was helpful, but not really necessary due to the ease of the application.  I felt confident that I could do it with no assistance.  It went on easily with no bubbles.  It still shows fingerprints but that isn't a huge deal for me.  I would no hesitate to recommend this product to others.",5,1,2018-10-14,1,5,0
So first attempt I placed the placement stickers on the outside while I’m lifting it to put it over the screen they are so flimsy the screen falls and gets lint all over it. The second attempt my husband is installing the screen protector and the protector just snaps and breaks. Thankfully I bought the 3 pack so last attempt we get it on and I leave my phone sitting come back and the screen protector is cracked. Nobody touched the phone.  So I wasted my phone...,1,1,2019-3-2,1,6,0
Love this product! It was easy to install and it works perfectly with my new iPhone.,5,1,2018-10-18,1,7,0
I really like the screen protector but one of the three was cracked on arrival and not useable and the other one kept coming up at the edges after I put it on. I will say that it could be installers fault on the second one but the third one went on without failure. I tried to contact seller for there warranty claim and it to get at least the first of three screens replaced but they have not contacted me back so this review is two stars. Out of the three one eventually was great and is a nice screen protector. But one is not what I paid for.,2,1,2020-5-30,1,0,0
"I made the mistake of paying $40 for a zagg screen protector when I bought my new phone because I was told it’s the best and FREE replacements if anything goes wrong. Huge lie!! I’ve been through 3 screens in less than 7 months and it’s $10 to replace each time, plus they say it’s scratch and ding resistant which is another lie. This Ailun product comes with 3 protectors, because let’s be honest, nothing is 100% scratch and crack proof, and it goes on soooooo easily and looks like melting butter as it adheres to your phone. Bubble proof and perfect!!! I will always buy all future phone screens from this company and never again from anywhere else! Best price for this product!!",5,1,2019-8-28,1,2,0
"I love these screen protectors. They have been my go-to brand and I like to have back up readily available whenever I drop my phone and need a replacement screen protector.  I’m happy to report that out of all the times this brand screen protector has been used, it has always served its purpose and never failed in protecting my iPhones. I have tried the other popular brand “zGagg” and to get the replacement you have to pay $5.99 for shipping... uh no thanks. I’ll always keep these handy and will recommend to others.",5,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"I ordered the item. One of the screens was broken in the case. It's glass got everywhere and was really fine and airborne and breathable. they are supposed to have laminate layers to protect users. If this screen breaks. You will get micro slivers of glass in your mouth and eyes.Also, this product IS NOT anti-glare as labeled.  It is ALSO NOT scratch Resistant.  Be careful about buying bad products that are not manufactured by the company they claim to be from.",1,1,2020-5-31,1,0,0
Super thin and didn’t come with the frame to assist with install. With so many other competitor products available seems like a miss to not include such a helpful tool for this product. The screen protector itself is VERY thin so if you’re used to using these don’t be surprised at the thickness. Also it came with 3 screen protectors but only two wipes? Which we had to use on the first install due to it not being moist enough to properly clean the screen.,1,1,2020-8-3,1,0,0
"I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max. I carefully followed their instructions and it was easy to install. The scariest part is making sure you lay it down centered and in the right place, but mine came out perfect. It is hardly noticeable that it is there!  I was worried that it would effect the touch on the screen, but there is absolutely no difference! I'm glad to have it there to protect the glass on the phone!  I don't know about the Anti-Glare rating above, once installed, it literally looks the same as without it. Definitely a good product and well worth the price!",5,1,2019-10-25,1,0,0
"Awesome screen protector! Touchscreen works flawlessly through the protector, the glass feels exactly like the original screen and it works amazingly to protect my phone.I dropped my previous phone face down on a grave drive way and my previous screen protector did nothing to protect it, so when I did the same thing with my new phone and this screen protector I was expecting the worst. To my surprise the screen protector did an excellent job of protecting my phone. This screen protector is layered with plastic similar to windshield glass which kept rocks from penetrating and cracking my screen. On top of it all  these screen protectors come 3 to a box so I had extras to replace the one I had broke .",5,1,2019-12-6,1,0,0
"Was paying $30+ for a 9H screen protector at my cellular carrier store with the “you buy this and get five free replacements” gimmick and then when I went in for the replacement, it was okay for the first replacement. After the beginning, it’s a run-around. “You need the actual box to do a replacement.” Well, Karen, you took the box on my first one and threw it away and didn’t tell me I needed it even when I asked. So, yeah, much cheaper, and you get three!! Same quality as my alpha glass was without the run-around from ole Karen at the store. Highly recommend!!",5,1,2020-7-28,1,1,0
"I have mixed feelings about these screen protectors. It seems to me like they break fairly easily. I’ve had screen protectors in the past that I don’t have to change for months whereas these I have gone through the pack already.  But at the end of the day, they do serve their purpose. They do protect the phone because the screen protectors have cracked but my actual screen is intact. They go an easily & the touch receptiveness is as if nothing was on.",4,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0
"Guys, this a great deal. It’s pretty competitively priced. The only thing I hate about it (along with many other screen protectors) is the stupid notch on the top. They could just cut out a notch for the speaker part but instead cut the whole top out. This makes it feel rather annoying on your Fingers as you end up swiping from the top to the bottom several times a day and that hump between the screen and the protector is pretty obvious. Other than that grip, it was rather easy to install. Offers decent scratch resistance and protection. As for the toughness of the glass, only time will tell. Hoping for the best!",4,1,2019-10-28,1,0,0
"I bought because it was fast shipping and it came in a pack of 3 but I purchased 11/25 and it’s now 12/26 and I’ve gone through all 3 already. I’m a little frustrated with myself because I thought as long as I take care of my phone it would last but with every clink it broke! I haven’t even dropped my phone yet. The first broke the next day, I noticed a sliver on the shield. I advise to just purchase one of good quality over more quantity. It really pays off.",3,1,2018-12-26,1,5,0
"I’ve gotten lots of different screen protectors through the years.  Most all of them, I only needed one and it lasted for years.  With this brand, I have already gone through two in a few months.  Not dropping my phone or being rough with it.  They just seem to crack VERY easily.  I’ll use them up but will not be buying this brand again.",1,1,2020-8-7,1,1,0
I’ve tried a lot of different phone protectors for each new phone I get & these are by far the very best!They give you everything you need to apply correctly to your screen.,5,1,2020-4-28,1,1,0
"My phone basically lives on the floor so I go through these like crazy. I’m not affixed to one particular brand, I just look for packs of 3 to make my life easier. These were okay. I installed the first one today and from my experience with previous screen protectors I wasn’t all that impressed. The packet that was supposed to be “wet” was almost as dry as the dry one. And the dry one didn’t seem to clean the screen that much I had to use my glasses cleaner for it. When I went to install it, the little grip stickers that go on the sides to avoid smudging the sticky part were A PAINNN they kept un sticking and I ended up using my own tape. I’m not exactly a professional but I have purchase a bunch of these and this brand by far has been the hardest to work with. Probably won’t buy again.Overall,",3,1,2019-10-28,1,1,0
"At first glance this seems like a freak screen protector. It goes on easy, it’s nice and clear and it fits well with a case. It seems like a good deal too, you get 3 in a pack.Well, now I know why. I have had my phone for about a month... I’ve already gone through two of these.  I’m going back to the Zagg screen protectors. They cost more but you get a lifetime warranty and they are built better.  I’ve only ever had to get a replacement once or twice in the whole lives of my past phones.",2,1,2019-10-28,1,1,0
"This screen protector deserves a 5 star in my opinion! I currently have an Xs Max and this screen protector is way better than zagg’s overpriced screen protectors that break easily!!! When I had a 7 plus, I bought this screen protector for the 7 plus and lasted for over 2 years without a scratch or a crack after being dropped multiple times. At the beginning of this year (April) I upgraded from 7 plus to my now Xs Max and bought a Zagg screen protector (Glass +) at Verizon for $40. The zagg one was applied by the customer service rep and it had problems with the bubbles that won’t go away even after trying to rub them out. I went back and they gave me a replacement zagg protector which also had bubbles issues then 6 months later it cracked when my phone dropped from the couch to the floor. I emailed zagg and got another replacement (glass elite) which cracked on the same day after dropping it again. My point here is, I’ve had cheap ones that I dropped multiple times without cracking and then decided to buy zagg ones and they cracked right away! I’m done with Zagg! These cheap ones are way better! And that is why I made the decision to but this $6.99 screen protector because not only are they affordable, but they do work better. I don’t understand why zagg sells theirs for $40 and they break easily while these cheap ones last forever!",5,1,2019-10-22,1,1,0
Like how easy it wast to install but they are garbage! The screen cover glass cracks if you look at it too hard!  Already used all 3 in about 2 weeks and I’m super careful and have never dropped my new phone. Not sure what type of glass they are made of but it must be super cheap. I guess you get what you pay for!!,1,1,2019-3-5,1,5,0
"If you need something to get you through for a week or two until your quality screen protector arrives, this will do the trick, otherwise small drops (less then a finger's length"" will result in ""cracks"" onthe protector which will become annoying to look at and make you want to install another one from the pack. I wouldn't recommend for long lasting durability or strength. This is coming from someone who's phone & screen is always in pristine condition when trading in after 2+years of owning the original device.",3,1,2020-2-26,1,2,0
"I ordered the 3 pack and have already put 2 of them to good use. The day after I put it on, I was walking with my hands full of groceries and my phone fell face down on the pavement from about a 4 ft drop. I smashed the screen protector, but the phone was completely fine! Not even a scratch on it! Then, this pst weekend I had set my phone on the hood of my truck, it slid and hit the concrete right on the edge. I have 3 little cracks in the current screen protector, but again, my phone is perfectly fine! I would highly recommend this product! I will be purchasing more here soon. (Since apparently I can’t have them last for more then a few days🤦🏻‍♀️).",5,1,2020-8-3,1,1,0

"You drop your phone in your carpet and your screen protector are gone, thats what happened with me, me and my wife both  replaced this one with some other cheaper but durable one. not worth to the price we paid, i dont know this is how it supposed to be or we were careless , i dont like it at all, but you may give a try. Should have included installation guiding frame to ease the installation. You have to align manually along the edge during installation, thats difficult way of installation",2,1,2019-2-4,1,1,0
I bought these for my iPhone 11 - total junk.  All three were cracked within a month.  I owned a iPhone 7s before Which was is the same size as this 11  and I was using the same style case I am now si this isn’t an issue of user error.  I get it - these prevent your screen from cracking but these should not have cracked so easily and soon.  I’m going to try and find the same brand I used for my last phone ( never cracked Once and still on my phone),3,1,2020-5-21,1,0,0
"This was definitely the easiest screen protector I've ever installed on a mobile device. Typical normal instructions, wipe w/wet towelette, dry with dry towelette, use dust sticker to catch any particles and, holding on to edge of protector, place it on the screen. This is where the difference came into play. As soon as I placed the protector down on to the screen, you could see it automatically start to adhere to the screen and push out any bubbles. I did not have to use the credit card type scraper most of the others require you to use to get a good adhesion. It was very cool to watch how the protector worked out the bubbles itself and now I have a screen with absolutely no dust, debris, hair, finger prints or bubbles under the protector. First time I've ever had a perfectly clear protector/screen. Very clear protector that fits within my Spigen Ultra Hybrid clear cover.  I can't speak to its durability yet since I only just applied it.I purchased this cover for myself and was not compensated in any way by Ailun nor even asked to complete a review. I was just so impressed at how well this went on to my new iPhone 11 Max Pro that I wanted to leave a comment.",5,1,2019-9-25,1,0,0
"I’m pretty happy with this screen protector. I had this same one for my iPhone 7 Plus and it lasted me almost an entire year before it started getting old and needed replacing. Ive dropped my iPhone 7 Plus plenty of times and the screen protector saved the day. So we will see if it lives up again with this IPhone XS Max protector. The reason I made it 4/5 starts is because I wish it covered a little more of the screen. It strictly protects up to the borders of the lit screen, leaving about a millimeter of space between the protector and a phone case. I’m not sure if that’s how all screen protectors for this phone are or not, but I personally would feel better if it covered the entire screen, not just the lit part. Overall, I’m happy with it and I hope it protects as well as it did with my IPhone 7 Plus.",4,1,2019-3-11,1,1,0
This product saved my butt today. I dropped my phone today which I almost never do and it was on asphalt never the less and it was face down. The screen protector saved the day and I saw many dents and cracks but none to my actual screen. So happy with this product. I did get nervous and buy an otterbox case now.,5,1,2019-3-31,1,1,1
item arrived the day before the iphone max launch .good price for the product easy to apply no bobbles no rainbow effect so far so good,5,1,2018-9-24,1,1,1

"This is the BEST screen protector EVER!!!!  Here’s why::  I was getting ready to leave a friends house late one night and a bee flew into my car. Ugh, I hate bees, I’m scared of bees, but my friend said she would get it out. She asked to use the flashlight on my phone so she could see it better. Sure, so I turned on the flashlight and gave it to her. After her swatting at the bee several times to get it out of the car, it landed on her hand, the hand she was holding my phone with. All of a sudden, she slams my phone down to the ground and screamed cause she was afraid the bee would sting her. OH NO!! MY PHONE!! It hit the concrete drive and my case broke apart and my phone fell out. My friend started apologizing over and over, but I told her not to worry. I knew she didn’t throw it on purpose, she was just scared. With the bee gone, I got in my car and drove home. Once home, I observed the damage to my phone. It looked like the screen had a crack in it at the top...WAIT! NO! It wasn’t my phone that had the crack, it was the screen protector!!  I WAS SOOOOO HAPPY!!!  I peeled off the screen protector, and could see it was cracked, but MY PHONE WAS PERFECT! NOT A SCRATCH ON IT!!  Sooo glad this package comes with 3 protectors in it. I put a new one on my phone and it’s perfect!  And my phone case? My phone case is still perfect as well. It did open and my phone did come out, but my phone is SAFE! And my phone case has NO BREAKS!Thank you thank you thank you for making such a great protector for my phone!!",5,1,2019-7-20,1,7,1
"It is a good deal to have 3 packs glass protectors under $7. You have all you needs to install the protector. it is easy but you have to carefully put down glass protector in the right position. Don’t try to pull it up by nail or you will break it. It is not strong as you think. Honestly, it is a fair price.",5,1,2019-1-29,1,5,1
"I recently bought an iPhone XS and two weeks later, this happens! If it was not for this screen protector, I would have severely damaged this phone and be out of pocket of $200.00 😩 I would definitely recommend this product and will be investing some more because this phone cost. Paying this price, as oppose to $200.00 replacement screen is a no brainer!",5,1,2019-1-5,1,5,1
"Good quality and easy instructions available to use the screen protector . Even if u use a case for ur xs max there is a small gap in all sides of the screen protector to the walls of the phone . Can view them in my photos too. If u didn’t fix the glass correctly , while using the phone it may look odd with sideways ( glass alignment to screen).",3,1,2019-1-4,1,3,1
"I’ve bought protectors from this brand before and I like it but this last one that I bought for the iPhone XS Max is not very good quality, I have been using it for 3 days and it’s already breaking. I haven’t even dropped the phone once..... it broke on the side and on the bottom right corner just from putting it on my pocket and carrying around, literally took it out of my pocket and it had broken, I did not sit or anything, you can just tell the quality of this one isn’t just bad (I also have a very good case that protects the screen and is way more raised than the screen protector) At least it’s a 3 pack but 3 days in I’m already using the second one when before they use to last me for months maybe even a year without being this broken.

This screen protector will likely protect your phone if it's the only one you have. It does not come with an installation frame and I didn't realize that when I bought it. I installed it and it's a little off and it's driving me crazy so I was going to have to use another one but wanted to give it a week or so to try to get used to it. My touch screen is not working well so that's a big factor in me going with a different screen protector.I have used different screen protection in the past and didn't even know it was there and this one I know is there.I don't like that. If I  hadn't used one I would have returned it.,2,1,2019-10-13,1,0,0
"This is a great protector for the cost!I have used many other screen protectors around this price range and this one is probably the best. Other ones around this price typically have what is known as a 'halo effect', but in my experience, none of the three had that.",5,1,2019-4-27,1,0,0
Screen is not as responsive with this screen protector on. Also doesn't cover the entire screen. I've had multiple screen protectors in the past the worked very well for me but they were just a little bit more expensive. I thought I'd give this one a shot because it was a little bit less than others but I would just avoid this specific one.,1,1,2019-8-14,1,2,0
"I think for the cost and how I treat my device, this product is perfect. It came with three screens, stickies for dust, wet wipe, and dry wipe. Since application, I have dropped my phone one time and it has stayed intact and hasn't even cracked yet. Considering my phone fell face down, that is impressive to me.I will say, I worked in the cell phone industry for 5+ years and had plenty of experience with applying these types of screen protectors. With that, it was easy for me HOWEVER, If you have not had that experience I wouldn't recommend putting this on without some cellular rep assistance. Since it doesn't come with a mold for you to have easier application you can have bubbles or of setting of the protector.",4,1,2019-12-16,1,0,0
"The screen protector is just too small for the screen and does not provide adequate coverage at the edges. The description upfront does not mention anything about it. In the FAQs it does mention that this does not provide full coverage. However, that is no excuse for how small this is. More often then not, screens crack at the edge. If a screen protector does not come up to the flat edge of a screen, it cannot really provide protection against impact.",1,1,2019-10-13,1,2,0
"I usually never review products, however this product is so disappointing, I would hate to not inform others. I bought this tempered glass for my new iPhone 11 Pro Max and installed it on Saturday evening, February 22nd. Today, February 25th, my phone was knocked off a surface and fell a distance of 2 feet between my wooden nightstand and wooden bed frame and hit the carpet. I thought it would for sure be ok, but upon examination I realized the tempered glass had shattered.

"Purchased my daughter a new Iphone at the Verizon store.  At the time of purchase, he sales person recommended a glass protector as the Iphones are notorious for their screens breaking as they are so fragile.  The price was almost $50.00 ???

"I’m always intimidated by the thought of installing a screen protector on my phone. I have OCD, so one speck of dust, or a slight misalignment gives me constant anxiety. This kit came with a handful of handy install tools. I wound up resorting to the tried and true schotch tape trick for the second round of dust control before landing the protector. I was a little low on the install, but still above the rounded edge of the screen, so it will work. No bubbles, no dust, no peeling edges. I use an Otterbox defender, and there is no interference at all. If I could change anything, it would be to make the screen protector slightly larger, as there is about a 3/32” gap of unprotected screen around the edges, where screen protector stops, and Otterbox starts. All in all a good buy compared to typical $40 for one protector!",5,1,2019-2-21,1,0,0
"I thought these would just be “meh” since I paid so little for them. LITERALLY the day after I purchased the screen protector, my brand new iPhone 11 Pro Max fell out of my pocket as I got into my car to run errands. I frantically searched for my phone, and luckily found it in the parking lot of the grocery store. I was so afraid of what the screen looked like as I picked the phone up, because it was face down and had been ran over (tire marks were visible on the case I had also just purchased.) I was beyond excited to find that my phone had NO damage to it.. NONE!!! The screen protector was shattered but it had done it’s job!!! There are 3 in the pack, so I easily was able to change the shattered one. Get this NOW!!!!",5,1,2020-3-8,1,0,0
This is a great kit for the price. They definitely do the job of protecting my screen which was most certainly needed. I wish they were a little bit wider on the screen - I don't feel like I should be able to see and feel the edges on my phone screen half a cm in from the case edge. And I've gone through the first screen cover in a week. But it does stick well to the phone and is easy enough to replace.,3,1,2020-9-7,1,0,0

My keyboard words weren’t working, I had to press very hard on a letter in order to text someone. So I contacted the seller and they responded right away.

"$6 for a set of 3 of these is a bargain, compared to $40+ at an AT&T store. Follow the directions step-by-step. Make sure you use the dust removal sticker after the dry whip, otherwise you'll get bubbles on the screen protector.Overall, very happy with these. Feels exactly like touching the normal iPhone screen & gives some peace at mind when you drop your phone.

"This is a great screen protector, it seems very durable, will see how it holds up . I’m hoping it doesn’t scratch up and stays looking as good as it does now..It was very easy to install, I wish I had bought these earlier for my older phones. I had bad luck installing other types of protectors in the past, I got tired of trying to get air bubbles out of them and looking terrible..",5,1,2019-9-26,1,0,0

"I love these screen protectors. I’ve been using them since I started using iPhones. You barely notice that they’re there, and they can take a serious beating without the actual phone screen breaking. My last phone got run over by a taxi - the phone itself wouldn’t turn back on, but this screen protector peeled right off and revealed an unscathed phone screen beneath. Any time I’ve dropped my phone and the screen appears to break, it’s only ever the screen protector and the actual screen is still perfect.",5,1,2019-12-29,1,0,0

I have had several phones and many different types of screen protectors. Since I bought these a few weeks ago I have already gone through all three and I have never had that happen before. I usually trade my phone in before my screen protector is replaced. These in my opinion have cracked super easy and the sides seem to chip easy. Not going to order again that's for sure. Disappointed.,1,1,2020-2-11,1,1,0
"I wanted to like this but I realized that I went through all 3 relatively quickly and I didn’t even drop my phone for two of them. I did appreciate that the first use I did drop my phone and it saved my phone from scratches and cracks which is great. The second and third times were from it simply being in my purse and the protectors cracked so easily. I’ve never had protectors that didn’t last very long and I usually take care of my phone pretty well, hardly dropping either. Not the best protectors in my personal opinion and I will try something else. The picture is of the last protector only having it on for two weeks and replacing it with another brand.",3,1,2020-9-21,1,0,1
"This screen protector stinks!! I drop my phone 3 days after putting it on and the damn thing cracks. I was shocked. The screen protector on my last phone was on for and entire year and despite the number of times I dropped it, it never cracked. There was no problem with a glare or issues with the touch screen, But unfortunately having it crack after just one drop is a deal breaker for me.",2,1,2019-10-29,1,1,0
"I have always hated screen protectors but with an iPhone XS Max it’s all screen. In just a few short months there have been small nicks and chips and I just couldn’t have anymore. From the wipes, instructions and ease of application, these were a perfect choice. You get 3 protectors and 3 wet/dry wipes. Packaging is professional and  reparable. I highly recommend.",4,1,2019-3-6,1,1,0
"This screen protector does not fit the iPhone 11 pro screen right. It’s narrower than the screen is and the only way to make it fit length wise is to have the top edge sit on the front camera, which I don’t like.",1,1,2019-9-24,1,2,0
"I’ve used many tempered glass phone protectors in my time. Never had a problem before now. This morning I woke up and noticed a had a few new scratches on my phone. No big deal, I have a protector on so it’s not my actual phone being scratched. I was wrong. At some point during the last 24 hours the protector apparently decided to remove itself from my phone. I 100% followed each step in the application, there is no doubt that it was applied properly. And now my brand new phone has several scratches on the screen from being in my bag. If I could give negative stars I would.",1,1,2019-4-27,1,2,0
Screen protector on for 5 min and already has a deep scratch  phone has not been dropped or had anything hit it. Glad there is two more protectors but not worth the money.,1,1,2018-10-26,1,5,0
I bought this product because it had so many good reviews but it seems like the material is very cheap. 1. When i tried to put it on it was very easy but I needed to adjust it because it wasn’t centered as soon I tried to lift the edge it cracked. 2. I tried another put it on my phone correctly my phone fell ONCE  the first day i put it on my phone and the tempered glass is already cracked in several areas. (See photo attached)  Never had a tempered glass shatter after one fall but should of known by the price it wouldn’t be the greatest 😂. Definitely wouldn’t recommend. Spend A little more for better quality!,1,1,2019-10-6,1,2,1
"I ordered this Ailun screen protector for my new iPhone because I have tried various screen protectors over the past few months for family members’ screens after having cracked one, and I love the quality and the ease of installation of this brand. With my iPhone XS Max, I was a little concerned about the installation of any screen protector because I wanted to make sure it fit seamlessly with the notch design of this phone.  I was not disappointed. On the first try, I was able to align the screen protector perfectly with the face of my phone. No debris was trapped under the screen protector, and I am completely satisfied. What I like about this brand other than the durability and the aesthetics is that it comes with wet and dry wipes as well as a sticky to get any remaining dust off. I also love that it comes with three screen protectors, and the price is amazingly low. I highly recommend this brand, and I will be using Ailun from now on for all future screen projector purchases.",5,1,2019-3-25,1,2,0
"Piece of JUNK!!! I put a new screen protector on my phone and in less than 4 hours it was already cracked and chipped because my 2 year old dropped it while trying to watch a video. Not just a little crack, the whole protector has cracks spanning the width and length with gouges out of the sides. My daughter dropped it on hardwood, but she was only holding it from about 2 feet up and it was definitely dropped, not thrown or anything aggressive. My last screen protector lasted 14 months. This one 4 hours. DO NOT Waste your money. I’m not even going to bother with the other two in the package.",1,1,2019-11-24,1,1,0

"We got this and we are impressed with the quality of these screen covers. They held on pretty well against oily fingers. Easy to apply and install. No issues.  It is a good idea to purchase the whole set as these get old and crack on the corners due to the curvature of the phone. Or gets very dirty and shows scratches. Yes, scratches like most glass even it says scratch resistant but is not scratch proof.  So far it has a good value and will buy again one all these settings is gone.",5,1,2020-9-18,1,1,0
"I have to admit I was skeptical about installing a DIY shield on my iPhone. I figured since it was more inexpensive than paying a vendor and this package not only provided three screens, but the guarantee is awesome. You can’t go wrong. The installation was fairly easy. Just take your time and plan your steps beforehand. I was blessed with good skin but it comes with natural oils and in the past this caused other screens to lift in the corner(s). This hasn’t happened as of yet With Ailun and I’ll update my post if it does. However, like I mentioned, the Company’s  guarantee sounds pretty solid and I would consider using it if I needed to. Also, keep in mind the purchase comes with three screens for the price of $11 which is still significantly lower than what I have paid a vendor for one install.",5,1,2020-6-3,1,0,0
"So, like many I was looking to save a few bucks on a screen protector. I was looking for a dependable product. After doing a lot of researching, I settled on the Ailun product.I have an 11 Pro Max iPhone, I had the Zagg Glass Elite VisionGuard+ prior to this screen protector, which I managed to crack after my phone dropped from a good 3’ height, for the fourth time.",4,1,2020-5-31,1,0,1
"Alright here is the deal. I got this cuz it was not that expensive thinking that it would last  for a couple of months as it was a pack of three. But this afternoon, I dropped my phone literally from 1 foot height and the protector cracked. I was like alright i dropped it and it could break sometimes because of the angle. Then I came back to my house and installed another one on and I flipped the phone to the back to clean the back. But the protector cracked again cuz it flipped on the table from no height. Overall, it is not durable at all! Do not get this if you want a strong protector",2,1,2018-11-28,1,3,0
"I just replaced a broken glass screen to the second of the package of three screens. The present screen’s strength did no meet my expectations.  I was simply exiting my car when my iPhone XS Max fell out of my coat pocket and fell to the street. That fall significantly cracked the screen in at least five areas, two of the breaks were completely across the screen.  The fall distance was less than 3ft from my pocket to its impact with the street. While the phone’s glass screen was protected, I was disappointed at the protector screen having shattered so extensively.I’ve already ordered a different brand of screen in order to ensure the phones continued physical security AND the protective screens integrity.",2,1,2020-1-16,1,0,0
"Dropped my phone face first into a puddle with rocks........and the screen protector did it’s job! There’s two very obvious impact marks where the screen protector came into contact with small rocks and spider cracked the HELL out of the protector but the screen is no worse for ware! The fact they ship a 3 pack is very helpful for situations like mine, and I’m going to order another set just to support them and have a backup because $7 for a three pack of screen protectors is a lot better than $329 for a screen replacement for an IPhone XS Max!!!",5,1,2019-12-7,1,1,0
"I have bought this before and that is the reason I bought it again.  It comes with everything you need including wet wipe, dry wipe, stickers to grab lint, and easy to install screen protector.  Basically clean the phone with wet wipe followed by dry wipe.  If you see any lint then use the sticker to grab it.  Next remove the back of the screen protector and place it on the phone.  You will see it start to adhere to the screen from one end to the other.  As long as the screen is clean and free of lint, you will see it adhere perfectly with no bubbles.  Also you get 3 of them in case one breaks or if you mess up.  Love it and highly recommend it!",5,1,2020-5-18,1,0,0

They are very clear and don’t interrupt your typing. The box comes with screen cleaner wipes, drying wipes, a dust collector sticker and the screen protectors. Such an easy kit with everything combined in it. I’ve been very pleased with them!

I usually make a three pack last for like three years because I get a new phone or lend them to other people before I need another one.

My first initial reaction was “f@$*...there goes my screen“ I grabbed my phone and to my surprise I noticed that all the damage had been absorbed by the screen protector. (WHAT A RELIEF!

"Excellent product, I have installed glass screen protectors in the past and this one went on easily. When I traded in my 7+ and they removed the glass, th screen was perfect.I would strongly suggest that you use the tape strips to guide the placement of the glass.

I purchased this item for my son because everyone who has a iPhone I know is walking around with a cracked screen. My son and daughter broke their phone screen a week afterwards.

I was so surprised to find two out of three are bad! And the worst is the only good one only last 3 days.  It got shuttered when my phone bumps to the edge of a table, with just one hit!

"These screens were terrible. I bought this in february, but didn’t actually use them until about 2 months ago. The first screen I put on cracked when I put the case on. My case didn’t cover the screen at all. So I dealt with it for awhile bc I hadn’t had a good opportunity to change the screen. Then I dropped my phone and it put 2 cracks all the way across the screen protector. So I changed it out and within a week (ONE DROP) later the bottom corner is shattered. Definitely not very good quality. I’d hope a screen protector would last longer than a couple drops. I have 4 kids and they’re all on my phone at some point, it takes a lot of beatings so for me, this isn’t a very good option",2,1,2020-9-5,1,0,0
"Love this screen protector. I bought one when I preordered my iPhone and haven’t had to change it since. I am pretty gentle with my phone and it doesn’t get dropped or thrown around much, but have yet to break it. I do a few minor surface scratches from wear and tear, but nothing out of the ordinary. The screen protector is sturdy and when applied correctly, it’s hard to remember it is on. Would highly recommend.",5,1,2020-7-1,1,0,0
"I was waiting to review this product, because I wanted to use it for a while after I installed it, because I tent to drop my iPhone a lot, and always face down ugh. so I go through screen protector like water, but this one I have to said have already survived a lot of drops on the street. I always forgot Phone when i leave my phone on my lap when I exit my car, but this protector has really done it’s job, and it still like new no scratches no cracks, and a breeze to installed.. VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE AND THANKS TO THE COMPANY FOR THE XTRA PACK.. will stick to this brand for now on..",5,1,2020-1-24,1,0,0
I’m honestly disappointed. I’ve purchased these screen protectors before and didn’t have any problems. I kept the same protector on for years and it never cracked and my husband and I just recently got a new phone and my husband got my old one so we replaced the screen protector on his and put a new one on mine. Both packages were from this company just different sizes (6s plus and XS Max). Mine cracked within one day and I am not rough on my phone I woke up with the screen cracked so i guess it cracked because I slept on my phone? And my husbands cracked after a one foot drop onto a rug a couple days after putting his on. I’m not sure if we both got bad batches but I’ve never had a screen protector crack so soon and the fact that both his and mine cracked within days of putting them on is also annoying. Disappointed when we’ve had success with this brand before.,2,1,2020-2-4,1,0,0
"I got a new phone less than two months ago so I bought these screen protectors. I've already gone through the whole pack of three. It's easy to apply and looks great (not cloudy, like how some screen protectors can be), but it just doesn't hold up well. The last of my screen protectors cracked this morning, and I haven't even dropped my phone. The time before this, it fell from about three feet, and the protector broke, as well as causing a tiny crack on the phone itself from one of the shards.Invest in a more durable screen protector. It'll be cheaper in the long run rather than having to replace these ones so often.",2,1,2019-12-26,1,0,0
"Update review: wrote to customer service and they sent me another set of screen protectors. Will be replacing the cracked one I have soon. Hopefully it won’t happen again. Overall, it was nice of them to do so. Bumped it up a few more stars for that.I’ve never had to write a review since I’ve been satisfied with most of my Amazon purchases but this screen protector cracked the first time my phone dropped just slightly. I was a bit disappointed since my past screen protectors have stayed intact and this one didn’t at the first drop. I’ve only had this put on for 1.5 weeks and now I have to either put on the extra one I got or buy another brand. Wouldn’t recommend this brand for screen protectors even though it had decent reviews.",3,1,2019-10-2,1,0,0

Ive used Ailun for years and have never been disappointed. I just had to replace my iphone 11 pro glass cover and was relieved to find out that I still had 2 out of 3 glass covers in the original box. The convenience of having a reliable back up is great! I was already thinking that I had to place an new order. I wanted to give props to this company as their customer service is impeccable and their products are high quality. I'd recommend them both to everyone. Thanks! 🧐,5,1,2020-2-23,1,0,0
As expected! Can’t speak to longevity because I put it on yesterday. But looks like a good product! Came with 3 screens and 3 sets of applicators. I always have trouble getting off all the little specs of dust that leave bubbles. But they had a little sticker type thing that you could use after cleaning to make sure there was no dust. Able to put it on flawlessly with no bubbles.,5,1,2020-5-16,1,0,0

"This screen protector is easy to install, looks great, and functions well. The only down side was in my expectations. I thought the protector would cover the entire front of the phone, but only the screen itself is covered. I am very satisfied with this product, however.

Great product idea however poor quality. This purchase came with 3 screen protectors which I originally thought was overzealous. Fast forward 6 months and I went through all 3 of the screen protectors due to random cracks and nicks that would appear on my screen. I haven’t dropped this phone on anything with high impact.

I've had one on my phone since novel with no scratching and no problems. This April my phone fell face down onto gravel from about 2 1\2 ft. The screen protector took the full brunt of the impact.

I have bought these screen protectors multiple times for my iPhone 11 Pro Max. They are awesome! I run a business with animals and my hands are very full most of my day. My phone falls out of my hands multiple times a day unfortunately or stuff falls on top of it. These screen protectors have seriously saved me so much money. They are incredibly durable. Even after they have cracked I don’t have to replace it. The cracks are so minimal that they aren’t noticeable. I’ve had a protector crack on me and I didn’t replace it for about 3 months when it finally cracked all throughout. I have bought 2 more packages. There’s 3 in each box. They’re great!

They will protect your phone GREAT!!!But for some reason a tap on it with a seat belt instantly cracked it and I thought it was kind of weird like it didn’t hit it hard it just tapped it. I know that’s it’s purpose to crack and protect but I had to change it quick due to that.,4,1,2020-9-17,1,1,0

I only gave this three stars because of the amount you get for the price. The quality is not great. The first one broke within the first 10 minutes of having the protector on.

Cheap and fast delivery with amazon prime but did not come with a case template to apply the screen which makes it difficult to see if it’s placed evenly on all sides.

This is definitely the worst screen protector I ever used in the market. In its product intro it says extra firm and I believed this steel like film could well protect my screen but after accidentally dropping my phone on the ground(slip thru my pocket) the whole screen was damaged BUT BUT! This screen protector is intact. I mean what the..? Is this being serious? The screen protector well protected itself but not my screen? Definitely not recommend this to anyone. The extra firm only will bring you extra trouble. Your screen will not be protected!,1,1,2019-2-28,1,0,0
Bought July 18 had on phone just shy of 1 month when I put my keys in my pocket with my phone and well I am on the 2nd screen cover because the keys put a scratch in the screen protector. So it is not as scratch resistant as claiming. I have used many other brands before and have put in same pocket as keys before and this was the only one that ever suffered a scratch from keys. And was not putting any force on screen to scratch.,1,1,2020-8-25,1,0,0

Definitely would not purchase again. Very difficult to install compared to other brands I’ve tried.  Hard to position correctly on screen due to lack of tabs to hold onto.  They send sticky tabs that you can put on tempered glass to help you position but they were very flimsy and still did not help you get the greatest alignment.  I guess you get what you pay for.  There is still a lot of glare on the glass too.  I’ll be going back to my other brand.,3,1,2019-10-16,1,0,0

I don’t think it’s really anti glare but my main issue is the installation. It doesn’t cover the entire surface and it is almost impossible to install without getting bubbles. You can try to remove the bubbles but you end up having to press the screen so hard to do it. I’d rather not damage my phone so I guess I’ll have to live with the bubbles. Would not purchase again.,2,1,2020-8-24,1,0,0

I have had terrible luck with installing screen protectors! This is the first one I was able to install no problem with no bubbles. The trick is to follow the instructions and place the protector on your phone and wait for it to completely adhere on its own. Quite satisfying.,5,1,2020-8-8,1,0,0
I have the Xs Max. This doesn’t fit properly. I have at least a 1/8 inch gap on all sides that don’t cover my actual screen. This is the worst. The best part of this is the ease of application. Guess I need to find something that actually fits. Don’t waste your money.,2,1,2020-7-14,1,0,0
Doesn’t have a frame like some other and not easy to line up. Crack rather easily. Slightly smaller than the phone screen so it’s easy to crack at the edges.,1,1,2019-12-30,1,0,0

"The product arrived in a timely fashion.  Installation is easy except one little thing.  The dust removing sticker is difficult to peel off.  My first attempt ended up ripping the backing paper with the sticker, instead of getting the sticker off the backing paper.  So one of the three was wasted.  The second one almost ended up with the same fate, but I managed to save it.",4,1,2019-8-9,1,0,0
The glass stuck to the phone screen without bubbles and sealed itself. However centering it exactly is an issue. They should have included a centering guide. Mine is pretty close to centered but shifters a little north but not on the front side camera or sensors. But because of this my thumb is getting tender as it runs across the bottom of the glass edge to swipe up for home.,3,1,2020-6-18,1,0,1
Not worth the money I have spent. I ordered a 3 pack and have already cracked the 2nd screen. I do not drop my phone nor am I tough on my phone. The first screen I am not sure even how it cracked. Same for the second. I will be looking for a better more durable product.,1,1,2020-7-27,1,0,0

The amount of disappointment that came out of this screen protector can’t even be explained!! I’ve been using glass screen protectors for years and never had an issue with my ACTUAL screen being broken even if the protector gets cracked.

They fit nice and do the job. I bought this pack after spending $40 on a single glass protector that cracked within a week. These ones also crack pretty easily (if you drop your phone a lot like me) but they’re cheaper and you get three.

"I used this product for my new IPhone XS Max.  I only had the IPhone since June of this year, my screen protector I received in the later part of the month.

Absolute trash ! I thought for the price it would be good but I put my phone in my bag and not even 5 mins later I pull it out it has a chip at the Bolton and to cracks. I put it in my pro max it hasn’t been on for even a week and I have not dropped my phone once. I have a wallet phone case so the screen was already protected bc if that and the screen protector somehow manages the crack in my bag ??,1,1,2019-9-30,1,0,0

I installed my screen protector was pretty excited about it when I installed it no bubbles appeared which I was happy about but the next day out of no where I get my phone out of my pocket and boom the screen protector was cracked. Never dropped it or anything.,1,1,2018-10-14,1,7,1
"I'm pretty happy with this product! It comes with two sets of wet wipes, dry wipes for cleaning and the  tempered glasses.  Very easy to install by following the instruction. It went nice and smooth for me--no dust, no air bubbles underneath, no fingerprint, no smudges on top, just like the original screen without any protectors. Screen sensitivity has not been affected at all. Now I don't have to worry  about the heavy drops with my kids playing. Overall great product, great price. Highly recommended!",5,0,2018-10-11,1,4,0
"I've gone through my whole pack and just put the third one on today so I will be ordering a back up. They look great and are by far the best screen protector I've had. Usually I hate putting screen protectors on my phone because it makes the screen looks less than stellar and also my make up usually sticks to it when I talk on the phone. It doesnt do that with this kind! I will say they did seem to crack pretty easy, which is why I've gone through the whole pack but the price totally makes it worth it.",5,0,2020-6-30,1,0,0

"I'm hard on my phone so I'm not surprised to see how many of these packs I've purchased since I got the iPhone 11 Pro Max. I like these because they cover the entire screen and they're easy to install. This is so minor but they recently changed how they seal the package and I hate the new glue method. I like the old sticker seal better because the glue makes it impossible to open the package and keep it looking neat. The only reason I care if it's neat is because this comes with multiple protectors, so I keep the package around until I use them all.",4,1,2020-9-17,1,1,0
"When I bought my iPhone 11 ProMax, I let the salesclerk talk me into the glass screen protector that they sold in the store. He installed it for me. What a disaster! It was installed crooked, had an air bubble and gained its first crack before I left the store.Because the old screen protector was installed incorrectly, the edges began to degrade. When I finally (almost 1 year later!) decided to replace it, I was amazed by the price and reviews of this product and decided to give it a try.",5,1,2020-8-29,1,0,0
"It’s a glass as it stated. It’s not too thick which may give a bumpy side on the edge. So that the phone looks sleek but it’s thick enough to give protection. It fits so well on the flat side of the screen. I saw some protectors size is too big over the curvy edge which catch dust. It includes a wet and dry wipes. Wet wipe helps a lot plus it has an extra sticker for sticking out the dust. I had previous protector installation experience. The instructions needs to improve. It should state the sticker side number one facing down to the phone. It’s little confusing. It’s hard to align the protector to the phone by just holding it on top of the screen. I align and secure to the side of the phone like a door hinge before removing the sticker number one and just flipped it over the phone screen. Don’t follow the instructions that come with, hard to hold steadily by hand.",4,1,2019-2-6,1,0,0
"I bought these because they were cheap. The protector could have a little less cut out on the top to protect more of the screen but I checked out all the other protectors and they are basically all the same so if your thinking about going with another protector for that reason your not going to have much luck. Easy to install, good packaging. The only thing that bothered me was I had my phone in my pocket with my keys and I noticed 3 huge visable scratches after only 2 days installed. Almost like I need to change the protector already. Thats the only reason Im not giving 5 stars. Some of the more expensive screen protectors are almost a little softer to prevent scratching but this on scratched pretty easy.",4,1,2019-1-14,1,0,0
"I really like this product. Once lined up, it practically installed itself. Either it is very easy to line up, I'm highly proficient at it, or I just got lucky but it is perfectly aligned. I'm glad that they do have 3 per package in case one installation gets botched. I have other iPhone that I've used for over two years without such protection and there are small scuffs in the glass. I'd expect this product to prevent that and perhaps protect it from something that could otherwise crack the screen.",5,1,2019-10-21,1,1,0
i bought this before seeing the xdesign product. i prefer it. why?the stresser with these products comes with installation. you want to get it straight the first time so you don't have to remove and retry. xdesign provides a device to help with alignment.,4,1,2020-3-17,1,0,0
"The price is great and overall its a okay screen protector. My biggest problems was making sure its perfectly aligned when I was installing it, which is a pain but got it down after 2-3 tries. Because of having to reapplying multiple times I was concerned about the adhesive, but I ended up switching to a different protector after a few days. Also because of the pain of applying it I wasted one protector cause lint got it so just a heads up always make sure the glass is clean before applying even after wiping. But when it was in use, I had no problems with the touchscreen or any bubbling which is good. But overall its okay for its price but for literally 2 dollars more you can get better quality and a kit with a frame for easily installing.",3,1,2019-8-23,1,0,0
"I've been purchasing screen protectors from this company for a while now & I always come back for more. I purchased these for my iphone 5, 6+ and now my 11 pro max. I will say that you definitely get what you pay for. I've noticed in the past that the protector does crack easily if hit with something like car keys. I often just throw my phone and keys into my bag and my car key will leave a dent or even crack the screen. It's honestly kind of my fault so I can't ding them for this. Luckily, it does come in a pack of 3 so you can always just replace it again. Regardless it protects my actual phone screen so ti doesn't matter since it does its job. Installation is easy. I will say that I've seen some screen protectors come with a little guide for even easier installation but you don't really need it. It's not that hard to install the screen protector. Overall, I'd recommend this product.",5,1,2019-11-23,1,0,0
"Just got a new iPhone XS Max and I've always used screen protectors and so this was the first thing to put on there. I'm used to putting these screens on but I have to say, it was so easy. If you align it properly (after wiping down the screen with the Wet and Dry wipes as instructed), it goes right on and if you don't touch it, all the bubbles fall right out. I simply aligned the screen over the iPhone, and gently very gently dropped it into place and boom. DONE! And NO BUBBLE!!! They send you 3 which is good because I took off the screen cover wrapping too soon and laid it down on the table while wiping the phone so it picked up dust on the sticky side. So remember, wipe the phone first and take the wrapper off the screen at the very very last minute before you are ready to put it on. Hope this review is helpful to you and remember to protect your expensive phones!! :)",5,1,2019-1-4,1,0,0

"My 14 year old has been obsessed with upgrading his starter iphone 6.  His father and I endured endless debate on the merits of all new phones andriod versus Iphone until we were ready to poke our eyes out.  When he decided that he wanted the Iphone 11 promax I was, understandably reluctant to spend that much money on a phone, for a fourteen year old who often, can't remember his own house key.  However he's a good kid and it was ALL HE WANTED for Christmas and his Birthday.  So we cracked and bought a phone for that costs more than my first car.AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT?  Money, it turns out CAN buy happiness.  My wonderful child was so happy that he has consistently been nice.  I'm not saying he's perfect cause he's mine and he's still a sarcastic ball of hormones who's learning and  (I hope) getting better every day.  The phone has shifted some teenage angst between us and somehow become a symbol of how much I love and trust him.  I get hugs now, for a solid month and where before only scowls and closed doors existed.  I would do it all over again in a heartbeat.",5,1,2020-1-23,1,0,0
"Had this brand of screen Protector for two weeks. I have already cracked one glass. I had my old screen protector on for over a year until it cracked. It’s hard for me to believe that in two weeks I did more damage to my new phone screen protector, than I did in a year on my previous one. But those things can happen. The customer service is really good though. They replaced a package of screen protectors for me, when my first screen protector went on with lint and bubbles, and my second screen protector went on with the edge not sticking all the way to the phone screen. This also isn’t the easiest screen protector to apply. I’ve had others that give you guides to line up everything perfectly.Updated 5/14/20..  these are the worst screens protectors I have ever had. Out of six, one lasted 3 months, the others lasted 2-7 days before they cracked with lines down the screen. Haven’t had any issues like this with other screen protectors before. And yeah I’m sure they would replace these for me under warranty, and because of their warranty I could theoretically get these free for life because these never go on my phone correct. Whether it’s dust or lint that leaves bubbles, or the edges that never stick down. But it’s more of a hassle than it’s worth to use them and replace them all the time.",1,1,2020-2-25,1,0,0

"1 of the 3 protectors came damaged. It was a decent size crack so it was disappointing. Unhappy overall that all 3 were not okay but at least it wasn’t all of them. Other than that they seem like an average screen protector.Update after a few weeks: I really dislike these protectors. They mess up my typing an astounding amount, at first I thought it was from the new phone but it’s been long enough now i know it’s got to be the protector. I think it’s too thick or too low quality to work properly. I would not recommend this, and would give it 1/5 stars.",2,1,2019-10-21,1,0,0
"This was one of the easiest screen protector's to install on my Iphone.  They provided the wet wipe and dry wipes to clean the screen before hand.  I cleaned the screen, placed the protector on and installed.

"I've always hated installing my own screen protectors but for this one it's actually quite easy to understand the instructions as well as applying it. The one tip that I have (iPhone XS Max) is to turn on the screen to something with white background, that way you can see exactly where the screen curves are (the cutout for the front speaker and camera is located). This way you can align the screen protector with precision. Well, it comes with 3 so if you messed up you get 2 more tries. =)",5,1,2018-11-16,1,1,0
"Ordered this and it came quickly of course, has a few in the box in case you have multiple phones (or like to make mistakes!) I used the cleaning and drying cloths as well as the final dust removal sticker and when I put my screen protector on and flattened it out, I had not a single air bubble, and in using it in the week since applying it, I can still use my phone with regular pressure on the screen and force touch things work great too, all without any air bubbles or dust penetrating the glass screen protector.

"These were a snap to install! Very good fit. Came with little guide stickers as well as a dust sticker. No matter how clean you get your screen before installing, that last pesky piece of dust or dirt seems to find the screen right as you’re getting ready to put the protector on. The dust sticker was perfect for removing the dust at the last second to ensure a smooth application. Very nice looking, and reasonably priced.

"This Ailun screen protector is worth its weight in gold!  Firstly, I just applied a second one, and it goes on smoothly and perfectly.  It’s a pack of 3.  The first protector had been on my phone for at least a year with no bubbles or issues.  Two weeks ago, my phone slipped out of my hoodie pocket while I was riding a bike, and immediately got run over by my rear bike tire.  As you can imagine, my “screen” was broken in many places with spiderweb cracks.... at least, I thought my screen was broken until yesterday when I took a closer look & realized NO, it was only the protector that was shattered in many spots... I peeled it away to reveal a perfect phone surface, like new!!  My joy is such that I am inspired to write this product review... a true rarity for me!  Buy this!!  I am super impressed by this product’s protection of my phone!",5,1,2020-1-29,1,0,1
"These would be so much better if they were a bit bigger. They leave a gap around the edge where dirt and grime gets stuck and then you have to clean around that edge. Also, you can easily see these even when you have a cover on your phone. They work fine as far as the touch capability and are pretty scratch resistant, but the size just really bothers me because they could have easily fixed that and made these better.They're decently priced, but I recommend spending a bit more and getting the ones that curve around the edge. These look and feel cheap.",3,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
"I haven’t dropped my phone yet but there’s scratches and scuff marks on my screen. From what, I’m not sure but I’ve never had a screen protector get scratched. Cracked? Definitely. Chipped? Sure. But scratched? No.I’m really sad about it because it bothers me that it looks like something is spilled on my screen. The installation was also annoying as the screen isn’t an exact fit so I kept having to pull it off and readjust it. After multiple attempts I finally gave up and came to terms with it not fitting properly. The screen is too long and the curves don’t match up. Overall I’d get a different screen protector next time. Price isn’t bad but there are other ones for around the same price.",1,1,2019-10-14,1,0,0

Peeled off screen protector....and my ACTUAL screen is broken!!!!! In all the years ive been using tempered glass ive NEVER had my actual screen break. And this being 10 max is most $$$$$ phone ive ever had. And im pissed now i have no choice but to go without screen protector or use new ones i ordered after they let my phone break which means im out money!  On fire right now.  I don’t recommend if you dont wanna risk your phone cracking.,1,1,2019-9-7,1,0,0
I really thought these would last. But sadly they only last about 4 months and a bubble will form on the right hand side. You can try and remove and reseat it but the bubble never goes away. Some how the adhesive delaminates. You are forced to use the second one. That will about the same time before it needs replacement. The reason they give you three is so that you may get a year out of it. You will passed the return window if they all fail within a year. I need to find a replacement.,1,1,2020-8-21,1,0,0
This product came very fast. Three pieces in a box is a good buy with this price. The glass is thin and very easy to adhere by itself. The touchscreen is very sensitive. I give it four-star instead of five is because of the size. It has ~2 mm gap from all sides so it is hard to align it exactly in the center. The bad result from the misalignment is that you will have colored glaring on the side(s) if that side is in the screen. You don’t observe the rainbow glaring if that side is located on the black screen part. I had to keep practicing to have the glass exactly aligned to have all four sides just located on the black screen part to avoid that rainbow. If they can add 2 mm on each side then it would be perfect to the iPhone side to side and much easier for users to install.,4,1,2019-12-17,1,0,0
"Add mine to the chorus of happy voices. I’m entirely pleased with this screen protector (and I’ve installed a lot of these over the years).  It’s glass and it comes with a comprehensive set of instructions and supplies to allow the user a problem-free installation. Once installed, it’s almost entirely invisible (it’s only natural that you can see the edges of the protector – you can always see the edges of screen protectors) and seems to have absolutely no impact on  touch sensitivity. It is, in a word, perfect.",5,1,2019-8-22,1,0,0
"This cracked VERY easily, more than any screen protector I’ve ever had! However, there was very good customer service and they sent me a replacement pack of screen protectors right away after I showed them a picture and explained the damage. Unfortunately the next set cracked easily too. One even cracked when I was just trying to pick up my phone off the counter. I barely lifted one edge of my phone while the other side was still touching the counter and then it slipped from my fingers all of 1/2” onto the counter (while it was face down). I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THESE!",1,1,2020-2-1,1,0,0
"I just bought my first iPhone this weekend, and bought these screen protectors in preparation. I figured that- with many places selling a single screen protector for $50- these wouldn't be the 'best' quality and didn't have high hopes, but boy, was I wrong. This pack of 3 screen protectors has been the best investment I have made in a long time! They come in great packaging with everything you need to install them and easy-to-read instructions. And the quality is the best I've seen! I can't believe I got a 3-pack for under $7! I will definitely be stocking up on these!",5,1,2019-12-1,1,0,0
"Good product. The only issue is that they  break rather easily. I’ve had used 4 of these screen protectors on the same phone because they crack easily. Sure, they are not expensive but having to buy so many no longer makes them such a great deal.  I’ll rather buy pay a bit more and not have to keep buying and replacing them so often.  Looking for a different brand ( after finish using the other two that I still have left from this particular purchase.  Maybe it just been my bad luck! Either way not talking more chances.",3,1,2020-6-21,1,0,0
"If you find a place in that is relatively dust free before you start, and you follow the instructions step by step it installs itself very well with few to NO bubbles. The key is to follow the directions (cleaning etc) and not to lay it down until you have it lined up correctly. They even include little guide stickers you can put on to help you lay the glass down evenly. Once you do, you just tap the center as the instructions say, and it will evenly adhere to the surface.",5,1,2019-12-10,1,0,0
"Not very happy.  Won’t buy this brand again. I prefer protectors that have an install bezel - this does not.  I’ve installed maybe 20 screen protectors, and know what I’m doing.  I have a few defects under the protector, and would be surprised if it was from me not cleaning the device well enough (meaning the screen protector wasn’t defect free).Lots of fingerprints on this - didn’t have those with the previous brand.  Look elsewhere.",3,1,2020-3-27,1,0,0
"This is the second screen protector I've installed on my iPhone, since the first one broke (took one for the team). This one was a little more nerve wracking to install, since it comes without a physical guide, but with care it installed perfectly, and it works as it should.  The screen sensitivity is great, and it looks ... well, you can't see it.  Follow the directions, be meticulous, and you'll be happy with this.",5,1,2020-7-18,1,0,0

"After spending way too much on a screen protector from Best Buy that ended up having lint stuck to it no matter how I cleaned and wiped my phone screen before applying, I ditched it and bought these. They are smaller all the way around than the phone’s screen but such a breeze to apply. Absolutely love that.No problems so far. Haven’t dropped my phone yet so I don’t know how well they will take a beating.",4,1,2020-2-21,1,0,0

"It fits well and protects the screen as intended.  Glass protector looks cleaner and more finished than the plastic ones.  The only issue is the protector can crack like glass.  There is 3 glass screen protector in the pack so you can peel off the damaged one and put a new one on.  Putting it on is pretty simple so it's just a matter of minor inconvenience.  My first screen cracked after 3 months (dropped a few times), so I am on my second.",3,1,2019-6-17,1,0,0
"Used this on my iPhone 11 and when I dropped my phone on my daughters swing and the screen protector got chipped in two places, I just new my screen was chipped too.

"Liked: Easy to apply, came with everything needed to clean screen/remove dust before screen application.Disliked: I have a very protective phone case, haven’t ever dropped my phone, and had the screen protector on for less than one week. Maybe my water bottle jostled in my tote bag enough to crack the screen? Wish these cases were sturdier and will not be purchasing again.",2,1,2020-8-27,1,0,0

"This product advertises “anti-scratch.”  This product will scratch.  However, this pic is what happened when I dropped a very heavy hole saw (complete with an arbor and an 8” bit) directly on the phone from about 2 feet up. (Don’t ask- it’s a construction thing). Anyhow, when i peeled the cracked up, gouged, screen protector off the phone was like new.  Buy this product if you have a good phone.",5,1,2019-11-28,1,0,1

Your finger glides across screen without effort.  I've changed 6 different screen protectors and they've all cracked with a simple drop of my iPhone.

Price is good and it has the wipes you need to prep the screen.,5,1,2019-9-2,1,0,0
"I usually either hate installing these protectors or love it.

"These are probably the worst screen protectors I have ever bought. The first set, first screen protector broke the first day.

Then I got a replacement and then all the packs of wet parts to the wipes are all dry. These aren’t even new these are terrible. I wouldn’t buy this again and I’m getting my money back.",1,1,2020-3-29,1,0,0
"Had the phone in my bathroom while taking a shower, came out and thought my whole screen was cracked, turned out to be just this, thankfully. Not sure if that makes this effective or less effective.

Still no damage to my phone which is great, but I wasn’t expecting this to be like this a month after purchase.",3,1,2019-8-2,1,0,0
"I found it easy to install. You do need a steady hand when positioning the protector above the screen before dropping it onto the screen, since once it makes contact you won't be able to move it to recenter it. No bubbles. ...

Bought this less than a year ago after replacing my phone due to a cracked screen.  Was easy to install and quickly forgot about it.  Yesterday I noticed a small impact crater and cracks on my screen.  Fortunately only the protector was damaged - it did its job.  Was easy to remove the broken protector and put on another one.

We've bought several screen protectors over the years of smart phone ownership, and never have I put one on without having to force air bubbles out.  BUY BUY BUY!!!

I’ve order ordered other brands but this will have to be my favorite.,5,1,2020-7-7,1,0,0
Really like I received 3 in a pack! This screen protector is much better than the Zagg invisa shield I had put on my phone when I purchased it new. I dropped my phone and the Zagg cracked.

I did it in the bathroom with some steam from shower to keep dust down and shined a light on it to make sure no particles adhered after I wiped it down.,5,1,2020-5-25,1,0,0
One of the best screen protectors in the market. I purchased before from other seller the other brands the ones which should be privacy screens but none of the worked the way this one worked.

so this comes with 3 protectors inside so you can apply one and keep 2 for future use.  Or if you make a mistake then use another one.  One thing is that it doesn't come with the tape for lifting up the protector after you apply.  I saw a dust particle after i applied the screen and wanted to lift it up.  I ended up using my nail to peel it up and lucky i was able to reapply the same one.,5,1,2019-8-20,1,0,0

"Good price, easy to put on (no air bubbles). Only thing is that I noticed how this is maybe .25 mm smaller than the last one I bought from Target.

The screen fits well and is fairly easy to install.  The only thing that would make this easier to install is to add a physical guide that goes around the phone when installing the screen protector.  It tends to come with other screen protectors and can be a big help.,5,1,2020-1-8,1,0,0

Have the 11pro max. Used the screen protectors on my previous phone 7+ and XR. The screen protectors fit the screen much better.  This one seems to leave a much larger portion of the edges of the phone exposed.  Worried that it might not work if I drop it on the side.,3,1,2020-1-2,1,0,0
